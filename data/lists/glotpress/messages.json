I know, maybe it's a rare situation, but it happens and I think\nit would be better to have the whole project title displayed.\nWhat do you think?\n2. Display the number of all/untranslated/waiting/fuzzy/warning strings next\nto those links. I'ts good to know how many strings you still need to work\non.\n3. The tab index when showing the string details. When you click on\n\"details\", the next tab is the \"Add translation\" button, but I think it\nshould be the \"Copy from original\" link, next \"Translate from Google\", next\nthe file reference, and only then the button.\n4.

When we\nrefresh the page it seems to go away, but it's kind of annoying, because you\ndon't know if the string was approved/translated or not.\nThat's it by now, thanks for GlotPress!\nCheers\n-- \nC?tia Kitahara\nwww.catiakitahara.com.br\nwww.wp-brasil.org\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/glotpress/attachments/20100421/86e84a91/attachment.htm\u003e",

The rest you can do via the web interface.\nHappy translating,\nNikolay",

Is this list the best way to communicate with other developers, if\nnot what would be :)\nI'm going to assume this is the best way as I can't create new posts on\nthe blog.\n2. Is there a a place to see coding standards or there is no coding\nstandard (yet)?\nOn a side note, I created a git repository on github for glotpress. It\nincludes the external svn repo's as submodules. You can find it at\nhttps://github.com/petervanderdoes/glotpress\nI shall try to keep this updated with the SVN repo.\n-- \nPeter van der Does\nGPG key: CB317D6E\nIRC: Ganseki on irc.freenode.net\nTwitter: @petervanderdoes\nWordPress Plugin Developer\nBlog: http://blog.avirtualhome.com\nForums: http://forums.avirtualhome.com\nTwitter: @avhsoftware",

Besides some\nchanges to the local.php the last \"program\" update was nearly 2 months\nago. There are several tickets in Trac with patches that have not been\nacted upon.\nSo my question is, what is the status of the project?\nI ran into a bug myself yesterday, I wanted to update the originals\nand doing so made something like a 130 original strings obsolete,\nrunning another import and the obsolete went down to about 30, and if I\nkept importing it kept switching between 130 and 30 obsolete\nstrings, and just so you know these obsolete strings weren't suppose\nto be obsolete as they existed in the original .po file.\nSo I wrote a patch for this, I still need to test some but it seems to\nwork. If the project is still active I will submit a ticket and attach\nthe patch.\nIf the development is at a stand still, or just dead, I might consider\nthe option of willing to taking over the project and revitalize it.\nRegards,\nPeter\n-- \nPeter van der Does\nGPG key: CB317D6E\nIRC: Ganseki on irc.freenode.net\nTwitter: @petervanderdoes\nWordPress Plugin Developer\nBlog: http://blog.avirtualhome.com\nForums: http://forums.avirtualhome.com\nTwitter: @avhsoftware",
