Subject: [glotpress] Innuktitut for Wordpress?
Message-ID: <CAHtzcfPBsA_vQuy1_xx006ZKatgttanAWmsmXyXDAX=2aCc5Aw@mail.gmail.com>

I saw this:  http://glotpress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/626

Does this mean that Inuktitut is scheduled to be packaged as a WP install?

Hi there,

I updated a working version of GlotPress to the latest trunk but that reverted to a nice WSOD. I have tried to understand what's going on and what is causing the issue, but adding define('GP_DEBUG', true); to gp-config.php is not doing the magic I expected it to do..

Can anyone help me out here? :)

Thanks,
Remkus

If you have a white screen there must be a fatal error, which should
be logged. Where, depends on your particular setup.
