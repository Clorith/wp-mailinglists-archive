Hi Nikolay,

I've been using GlotPress at translate.wordpress.org and it's very good!
Good job!
But I'd like to suggest you some things:

1. The Breadcrumb next to the GlotPress title is quite confusing. When on a
page with strings to translate, it doesn't show the whole project title. I
think it's a problem, when for example I have more than one browser tab
opened with two different glotpress projects. I was translating both
BuddyPress and WordPress and as both tabs were displaying the title:
GlotPress > Development (trunk) I was confused which one was WP and which
one was BP. I know, maybe it's a rare situation, but it happens and I think
it would be better to have the whole project title displayed.
What do you think?

2. Display the number of all/untranslated/waiting/fuzzy/warning strings next
to those links. I'ts good to know how many strings you still need to work
on.

3. The tab index when showing the string details. When you click on
"details", the next tab is the "Add translation" button, but I think it
should be the "Copy from original" link, next "Translate from Google", next
the file reference, and only then the button.

4. Add the approve/reject buttons to the string details view, like we have
on the bulk edit.

Besides that, sometimes there seems to be a sort of a bug. Sometimes a
string I've just added keeps repeating, instead of jumping to the next one.
Another friend who's helping translate WP also experienced this bug. When we
refresh the page it seems to go away, but it's kind of annoying, because you
don't know if the string was approved/translated or not.

That's it by now, thanks for GlotPress!

Cheers

This is a known bug, but needs a little more work and I keep
postponing it, because of more important things.

You can track the progress here: http://trac.glotpress.org/ticket/83

Yes

I modeled the tab stops after my behaviour?I rarely use Copy from
original and Google Translate. When I need them, it's ok for me to
grab the mouse and click on the link.

If most of you use these two links often, just tell me, we can put
them back in the tab order.

There is a ticket for that: http://trac.glotpress.org/ticket/30

I, myself, rarely approve strings and didn't have much urge to
implement it. You can blame Z? for not  bugging me enough :-)

Yes, this is very annoying and this will be the first thing I will fix.

Thank you very much for giving GlotPress a chance.

Happy translating,
Nikolay.

Well, Nikolay,

It seems it's time for me to learn how to open tickets on Trac :) duh

Yes, you're right, I don't use those links that much too, but sometimes I
use "Copy from original" when there are very similar words in Portuguese and
I just need to edit one letter or when there are too many placeholders.
Anyway, I guess the way it is now is ok. I just thought you missed those
links.

There are 4 people at least helping me translate, so I think it's very
important!
The bulk approval is great! We must think beyond our own experiences. I
think GlotPress will be more usefull yet for those who are translating
WordPress or anythingelse for the first time, when there's a real team of
translators.

Cheers!

This should be fixed now. The accompanying ticket is

Happy translating,
