Subject: [glotpress] New to list and some questions.
Message-ID: <20120117090912.08d89262@Indy>

I know the list is kind of dead, I mean according to the archive the
last email was send 6 months ago, but it is worth a shot to try here.

My name is Peter van der Does, I have written a couple of WordPress
plugins and thanks to some recent publicity, WordPress and Joost both
using GlotPress, I found this project and want to use it for my own
translations, not just for my WordPress plugins but I can use it for
other software as well.

Unfortunately it seems the project is at a stand still. Besides some
changes to the local.php the last "program" update was nearly 2 months
ago. There are several tickets in Trac with patches that have not been
acted upon.

So my question is, what is the status of the project?

I ran into a bug myself yesterday, I wanted to update the originals
and doing so made something like a 130 original strings obsolete,
running another import and the obsolete went down to about 30, and if I
kept importing it kept switching between 130 and 30 obsolete
strings, and just so you know these obsolete strings weren't suppose
to be obsolete as they existed in the original .po file.

So I wrote a patch for this, I still need to test some but it seems to
work. If the project is still active I will submit a ticket and attach
the patch.

If the development is at a stand still, or just dead, I might consider
the option of willing to taking over the project and revitalize it.

Regards,
Peter

Hi Peter,

Thanks for this. Your help is warmly welcome. We do indeed need to
revive patching GP. Even though the discussion isn't quite dead, we've
mostly moved it to http://blog.glotpress.org

Bug fixing is obviously crucial, but the same can be said for testing
patches, which has been severely overseen. Would you care to visit
http://blog.glotpress.org/ and debate it there?

Thanks
Z?

Z?,

Tanks for the quick reply. I've visited http://blog.glotpress.org/
yesterday and for some reason the WordPress bar didn't show up, so I
could post anything. I just checked and it seems to be working now.
I'll do a post there.

Subject: [glotpress] How do developers communicate for GlotPress and some
 other questions
Message-ID: <20120118213357.2c0ac05b@Indy>

Hi,

As somebody who likes to help out with the development of GlotPress I
have a few questions.

1. Is this list the best way to communicate with other developers, if
not what would be :)

I'm going to assume this is the best way as I can't create new posts on
the blog.

2. Is there a a place to see coding standards or there is no coding
standard (yet)?

On a side note, I created a git repository on github for glotpress. It
includes the external svn repo's as submodules. You can find it at
https://github.com/petervanderdoes/glotpress

I shall try to keep this updated with the SVN repo.
