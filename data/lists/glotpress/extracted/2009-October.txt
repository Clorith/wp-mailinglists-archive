Subject: [glotpress] Question about po files
Message-ID: <4FA5BEDC45324027B789FAF72EAE0CC8@Sony1>

Hi everyone,

I'm new at this list

I have a question, GotPress can make the po files searching into the source 
or I have to use software like poedit for make the po file and then upload 
to GlotPress?

I installed GlotPress at my blog http://www.buddypress-es.com. GlotPress is 
installed at http://glot.buddypress-es.com

Why I need GlotPress? Because I'm translating WordPress MU with 100 themes 
and all plugins WPMUDEV Premium.

All this is translated by a single file. Mo

The work of this is far and I would look if people help me with this 
translation so special.

Thank you

Sorry to take so long to respond. 

Thank you very much, I create different projects. 

Another question. Is it possible to give administrative permissions to a user, but only for specific projects? 

If it is not possible, I think it would be interesting to implement it.
