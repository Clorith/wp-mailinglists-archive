Subject: [glotpress] Export Translations doesn't work
Message-ID: <AANLkTike3nPfMEJywUT5D6vah2y9p_GxAlUGaJr5njYa@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm new in the glotpress world but I couldn't find any place with an answer
to my question.

I have GlotPress installed locally and works great, the problem is when
comes to install it in a hosting platform. I've tried in 5 different places
and everything works fine but just when I click the button export just says:
Not found (for the  url
translate/projects/oc/es/es/export-translations?format=po)

I would love to make this soft work for Open Classifieds, please any advice,
link or documentation, is more than welcome.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Nikolay,

We've installed GlotPress in our site to start translating plugins/themes
But we'd like to share the same table of users as our WordPress
installation, how is that possible? Could you please help us?
Thanks
C?tia

I added sample values and a comment in gp-config-sample.php:

http://trac.glotpress.org/browser/trunk/gp-config-sample.php?rev=503#L46

As the comment says before using the custom tables you should delete
your current permissions and then use the command line script to add
admins. The rest you can do via the web interface.

Happy translating,
Nikolay

You don't need trac to fix bugs! You need trac just to share your
solution with us.

The process is simple:

0. Log in in trac. If you don't have a wordpress.org forums account,
registration takes a minute: http://wordpress.org/support/register.php

1. Add a ticket: http://trac.glotpress.org/newticket

Include what happens, what did you expect to happen and a pissble fix.

2. You can attach a patch, with your solution. Just run a `svn diff`
ion your checkout and give us the result.

That's all!

Welcome and happy hacking,
Nikolay

It works for me on all installs I have. Both local and production.

Before debugging more, have you updated to the latest svn version?

Also, does the link without /export-translations work correctly:
translate/projects/oc/es/es ?

Happy translating,
Nikolay.

For the record, this issue was resolved in
