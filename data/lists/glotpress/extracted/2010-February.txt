Hi Guys,
Thought I'd introduce myself to the group. My name is Jeffry G, I'm a  
developer working on the Wp-e-Commerce Plugin. We have GlotPress  
working nicely with WordPress (moved DB and using WordPress users  
table) was easy as pie, liked it a lot.
We've been trying to customize the look and feel of the templates, so  
been hacking away at the interface a bit, but then noticed the version  
we are running does not have some of the new and cool features (google  
translate especially) so thinking of doing an upgrade...

I was just wondering:
1. What is upgrading like with this software?
2. Is there any documentation around that? oh and documentation on  
actually using the software?

I had a look at the two php auto documentation sites they are great  
for devs but not really so informative for end users.
I understand the project is fairly new, but think it would be great to  
get some end user documentation together (even a basic readme) . So  
more people can get their heads around the system. That way you won't  
be hastled by people like me trying to use the software and you can  
spend more time making the system run like the wind~

Anyway look forward to hearing from yas.

best
jeff

Currently, you can visit install.php?action=upgrade to upgrade your
database. Upgrading the code is just a svn up.

Nope. Until now most of the users have been comfortable with digging
up stuff in the code.

I added a simple README:

http://trac.glotpress.org/browser/trunk/README

Getting people who have questions to sign up to the list and ask them
here is not such bad idea ;-) At least we will know each other.

Happy hacking,
Nikolay.

Cool, thanks for the info,, will ave a look and see,, I did not  
actually install the software personally so have not seen whether it  
is a .svn or not.
