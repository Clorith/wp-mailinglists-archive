I just added img tag capability to my comments application and it 
looks like every comment with an img tag is being flagged as spam. Is 
that the case? Or is something else causing it?

You can test it here: 
http://www.scripts.oldguy.us/talkback/demo/index.php The img button 
inserts a link tag but it displays as an image using a lightbox.

Just read what wrote <banging head> It has nothing to do with img 
tags. The correct question is does a link to an img automatically 
flag a post as spam?

Subject: [spam-stopper] 404 to spam!
Message-ID: <3A8A134A-7998-4E79-AE1E-169E9F927273@lingo.com.mx>

Hi all:

I've been dealing with spam on my blog with a variety of techniques  
that I would like to comment and receive feedback on:

I'm combing the comment database every hour and harvesting unique IPs  
that Akismet (or myself) have flagged as spam.

Those IP addrs. get added to a DB file; Apache knows about this file  
and checks it with every invocation of wp-comment.php, if the IP is  
in the file, then t's presented with a 404 error page. End of story.  
That IP is forever banned to post comments in my blog.

I host my blog (http://bitacoreando.com) in a VPS, and a fairly small  
one at that, and I found that even though Akismet was flagging spam  
comments correctly, any smallish spam-storm would bring my VPS to  
it's knees. This solution has restored control over the resource  
usage of my WP install and since last december it has allowed me  
breathe easily.

I could hack my Akismet install to update the DB as soon as it has  
received a response from the central server, but I thought that maybe  
this feature could be discussed and maybe integrated into the main  
devel line of this plugin. What do you think?

I also have collected all the hourly cron jobs since dec. 21 and the  
actual DB file, all in all it's a lot of spammer's IP information  
that might be useful, so if anyone wants it, just say so

Best
Rub?n

I think this would be a bad idea. This type of IP blocking is both
over-broad and under-broad and the reason I Akismet is interesting to me
is because it is content based as opposed to originator based.

Very frequently, machines that spam are badware infected computers are
being used by spammers as proxies. Often, those computers will be fixed
later.  Then there are dynamic IP ranges or shared IP blocks with NAT.

It's bad enough when your IP is flagged and you have to moderate a
comment before it's posted. In your system, people are never given that
option chance.  There's no moderation queue or even an option for one.

If it works for you, that's great. But the price of the false positives
from an IP-based addition to Akimset like the one that you suggest is
far too high for me to be comfortable with.

I also have run into performance problems on Vservers. My solution was
to buy server space from someone who did not overload their hosts.

Regards,
Mako

The real risk is that when a legitimate user from the umpteen infected
machines that bombard your blog tries to *post* (not read, just post) she
gets a 404. I'll share with everyone on this list the IP addresses that
I've collected, you might check them with the IPs flagged as legitimate
comments, and if shows that I have a percentage of your comments' IPs,
I'll stand corrected and apologize :-)

My guess is that not one of the umpteen IP's that I have collected has
ever posted a single legitimate comment on a WP blog.

Maybe Akismet could take a step further and at least temporarily block
IP's for posting I don't see the harm on that.

On my case, dropping the HTTP transaction even before PHP got started did
the trick.

Subject: [spam-stopper] social bookmark spam filtering with akismet
Message-ID: <eebb01a60704251431k5174456fsc30e23ce30e72cdd@mail.gmail.com>

i know that some social bookmarking sites use akismet to filter out spam
links - as the developer/maintainer of such a site myself, i'm wondering if
akismet developers recommend this approach? here is how i would populate the
arguments of the API call:

comment_author
  - this would be a username, not a human name

comment_author_url
  - this would be blank, since we don't require a homepage url for signup

referrer
  -- this would either be blank, or identical to the comment_content

comment_content
  - this would be the submitted bookmark URL. i could append some heuristics
(number of bookmarks, age of account, etc), but i'm not sure that would help
akismet because it would have no semantics associated with the values.


permalink
   - i would use the user's homepage on Feed Me Links here.

comment_type
  - this would be "bookmark"


would using Akismet in this way be appropriate / useful?


thanks in advance,

are there any publicized (or publicizable) figures Akismet's global "install
base," which i guess means the number of active, unique API keys?

Message-ID: <c5e400c0704260923j697c665fkb429161faa271dd3@mail.gmail.com>

I am experiencing the largest spike in uncaught spam since installing
askimet long ago.  The rate has now reached 250+ / day and rising.  As
this is unprecedented in my experience with the plugin, I thought it
worth a note...

Using:
Askimet 2.0
Wordpress 2.1

Spam description:

Name: Anonymous

Emails: random(?) strings @ 10 or so differnet domain names.
l3lw at rocketmail.com
vphm at bigfoot.com
uiry80ipbxfr0 at home.com
c9c0d702 at mail.me

IP: plenty of repetition, but plenty of unique.

Content:
Compliments, 100s of them..  I'm unsure what the goal is with these..
Lots of repetition.

"Hello, I just wanted to say you have a very informative site which
really made me think, Thanks ! A site with a wealth of info.!?thanks
very much! Have a nice Day!!"

"It's a great website of yours. I surfed by and found it very
informative. Bookmarked and check you back in a while"

"I like the way you set up that your info is the homepage, nicely done. Thanks!"

"This site is put together well!"

"SarahBell ( ) wrote:"

"I enjoyed this site very much and have taken away a better insight. I
will recommend this site to everyone I know. More people should step

mike: perhaps the spammers are trying to get a single, innocuous-looking
comment approved in hopes that you have the "Comment author must have a
previously approved comment" setting enabled? so they then having a better
chance of spamming your comments in the future after having an initial
comment approved?

We got similar ones (not on WordPress, mind you). The current theory is
that it's more of a broken spam bot. It's either missing the actual
payload or it's expecting a separate field for the URL somewhere.

I've been getting similar "compliment spam" for ages. I've yet to figure 
out what it means. In case of email spam, the theory was that it's used 
to poison bayesian/content filters - if you marked them as spam, regular 
mails would also be spam since they contain similar words, and thus 
you'd be forced to turn off the filter.. I've yet to understand why they 
are doing it in the blog space - maybe similar - to "poison" 
Akismet-like global public filters?

Jaanus
