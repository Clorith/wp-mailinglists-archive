Subject: [spam-stopper] triggering a "false" response from api for testing
	purposes?
Message-ID: <5824D875-E3F3-41AE-999C-9DCF465FEA98@furrybrains.com>

hi there,

i'm new to this list so forgive me if for any reason i'm not  
following protocol in some way in my first message.

anyhow, i'm working on an application in which I would like to use  
akismet to filter a certain kind of person-to-person reminder message  
for spam. i'm trying to work a bit with the api in my testing  
environment to see if akismet will be able to handle these kinds of  
messages effectively.

the problem i'm having at the moment is that i can get nothing but a  
"true" response from the api...and since that's all i can get i'm  
having a hard time testing.

i see the suggestion about how to get a "true" response using "viagra- 
test-123" ... is there a way anyone is aware of that i can trigger a  
"false" response?

thanks for any help you can provide.

No this is fine.

This is odd, usually by sending just normal info you get false, maybe 
your API call is missing a variable?

Thanks for taking the time to reply Matt.

I actually did resolve the issue after I posted it, and you are  
actually correct -- it was returning "true" until I started passing  
comment_author and comment_email, at which point I was able to get a  
"false" return. (I didn't realize these were required -- that might  
be something worth noting in the API documentation in a future  
revision.)

As  I mentioned in my last email, I'm attempting to use akismet to  
filter spam in the context of a certain kind of reminder message. The  
challenge is that the application I'm developing does not require or  
even ask for a name or email from the sender.

This makes me wonder then, will my application really be able to use  
Akismet effectively without comment_author and comment_email (for now  
I am just passing the same dummy name/email for every request, for  
testing purposes)? Or is there a good name/email to use if one  
doesn't exist (but a value nevertheless must be passed)?

Well if anyone has any insights to share, I would appreciate it.

If your messages have subjects or titles, that's often good to use for 
the author.

What's an example message look like?

Before were you passing blank values, or just not sending the arguments 
at all?

The messages are very simple: body (which has a character limit of  
under 255) and the person the message is going to. As a parallel, it  
would almost be like running a "email this article to a friend" email  
through Akismet, where a from name/email wasn't required, and all  
there really was was a "to" email and a note.

That's a good question -- looking back at my code, I believe I was  
not passing the arguments at all, thinking they were optional. Later  
perhaps I will try passing the arguments with blank values to see if  
I can still get a "false".
