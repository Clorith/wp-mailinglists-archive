Subject: [spam-stopper] [release] vBulletin 3.6 plugin
Message-ID: <20070829142000.GB16956@el-muerte.student.utwente.nl>

I've created a plugin for vBulletin that enabled checking message for
spam with akismet. Available here:
http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=155386

Anyway, so far not a single obvious spam message has been confirmed by
akismet. The whole plugin works perfectly, when I create messages as the
user viagra-test-123 it will be detected as spam.
Is there anything I could improve? I already included an option to
include various entries from $_SERVER, but that shouldn't make a big
difference.

A more detailed response from the akismet servers would be nice. Just
true/false is not very helpful. I doubt the spam detection is as strict
as that and a lot of content is within a gray area. It would be nice to
know if content was like 70% spam.
