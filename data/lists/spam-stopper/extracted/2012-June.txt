Message-ID: <4FCA8C3F.5050601@wishlist24.org>

Hi all,

don't understand the following method

$akismet->setCommentAuthorURL($url);


which URL goes here?  if someone post in my application I don't have a author URL or do I fill in the Users URL (if this Author created an user n my site?
but how could the late be useful for akismet?

thanks
Michael

It's for when the commenter submits a URL with their comment - eg. their blog or whatever.

The field is optional and from what you say below it sounds like you don't need to set it.

If you don't have a URL then you don't need to put anything, or not even
call the method.

Afaict it only makes sense to use a URL entered by the user, to tell
more about themselves, not one pointing to your own system.

The API doesn't need all data, but it's kind of "the more the merrier"
in matter of determining whether it's spam

I only use IP, name, email and agent on my site, and I still get Spam hits.
