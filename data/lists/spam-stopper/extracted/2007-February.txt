www.sandbox.paypal.com lets you test things out on PayPal's API without 
having to worry about making real cash transactions.  What about doing 
something similar for Akismet?  eg. let people classify posts as spam or 
ham or whatever, for testing purposes, without having to worry about 
skewing Akismet's accuracy?

There could also be a few word combinations that'd always result in this 
sandboxed version reporting the post back as spam.

Anyway, just a random idea :)

Have your tried using "viagra-test-123" as the author name? It's 
documented in the API spec.

I guess I read the API docs to quickly, heh.  Thanks for pointing that 
out! :)
