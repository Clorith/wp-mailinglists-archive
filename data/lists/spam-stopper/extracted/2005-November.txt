I've been getting hammered with trackback spam, and Akismet hasn't caught
any of it. (It catches about half my comment spam.) Does Akismet now work
with trackbacks?
 
Thanks!

Akismet has always worked with trackbacks. Submit them as spam.

I've seen a lot of good feedback on this integration, congrats.

Yep, it's all GPL.

Subject: [spam-stopper] Python API
Message-ID: <438C53FE.4020506@voidspace.org.uk>

Hello,

I have a problem with guestbook spam and I'd like to look at Akismet as
a possible solution. I'm a Python programmer and happy to implement my
own interface to Akismet given the details.

Guestbook : http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cgi-bin/voidspace/guestbook2.py
Blog entry on the problem :
http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2005_11_26.shtml#e144

I've already  have several solutions in place, and have just
investigated adding a DNS blacklist lookup. Using three or four
blacklists it would only stop around fifty percent of my spam. :-(

Anyway, familiar problem. I've downloaded akismet and got myself a
Wordpress API key.

It turns out that Akismet is a php script... The development pages on
the website point to this mailing list. :-)

I'm happy to either implement a Python interface to the php script (?)
*or* a Python interface direct to the Akismet API. (And make the result
freely available under an open source license if you want...)

Are you happy to give me the details to do this ?

All the best,


Fuzzyman

It shouldn't be too hard to write a Python interface directly to
akismet; the details are all in the PHP code.


Here are the functions you need to implement:

- function akismet_verify_key($key)

  This does an HTTP post to http://rest.akismet.com/1.1/verify-key
  with arguments {'key': api_key, 'blog': blog_url}.  If the key is
  valid, it will return 'valid'.

- function ksd_auto_check_comment($comment)

  This does an HTTP post to http://rest.akismet.com/1.1/comment-check
  with the following things in the argument space:

  - all $_SERVER vars (these are basically the CGI environment vars -
    REMOTE_ADDR etc).  Run <?phpinfo()?> in PHP to see what these are.

  - 'user_ip': ip address of caller
    'user_agent': http user agent
    'referrer': http referrer
    'blog': blog url

  - everything else in $comment

  This returns 'true' if the comment is classified as spam.

- function ksd_submit_nonspam_comment

  This does an HTTP post to http://rest.akismet.com/1.1/submit-ham
  with arguments {'blog': blog url} plus all the columns in the
  wp_comments row for the particular comment.

- function ksd_submit_spam_comment

  As above, but submits a comment as spam, not ham.  (URL is
  http://rest.akismet.com/1.1/submit-spam).


That's about it...

Cheers,
Phil

So to check a comment, you don't *actually* need to call
akismet_verify_key ?

akismet_verify_key is just for the UI - so Wordpress can tell the user
that they typed their key in wrong.

It seems odd, though, that comment-check, submit-spam and submit-ham
don't seem to require the 'key' argument.  If akismet.com doesn't
validate these calls in some other way, it would be possible to submit
spam and ham to other people's blogs... a bit of a security hole.

Matt?

Cheers,
Phil

Hi Phil,

In the latest version of Akismet (1.11),
line 72, which sets the akismet host, reads:

$ksd_api_host = get('wordpress_api_key') . 
'.rest.akismet.com';

So they key is encoded into the connection 
rather than being passed as a parameter, and is 
therefore available for the server to check.

Whether or not the key _is_ checked by the 
server I'll have to leave to Matt to confirm.

Aha, I missed that bit :-)

So THAT'S why the ksd_* functions use $ksd_api_host while verify-key
goes straight to rest.akismet.com.

That answers the question/concern nicely.  I'm sure the key is
checked.

(Just goes to show: you shouldn't implement something just by looking
at the source, because you'll miss the important bits... you've gotta
snoop the HTTP connections to see what's REALLY going on!)

Cheers,
Phil
