SpamKarma added stuff to my database which I didn't want. I didn't
have the success with it that I am having with this. Also, for new
WordPress users, SK is a lot more complex to deal with. Nothing is
easier than Spam Stopper, though. Drop it in to the folder and
activate it and then enjoy!

Matt,
Would you consider renaming Automattic Spam Stopper?  I plan to use an
acronym to describe it, and this plugin bears no resemblance whatsoever to
ASS!

I just checked my database and had a stack of spam in there over the last
few days, and I didn't see any of it.

Thanks Matt!!!

How about exchanging "stopper" with "barrier" or "filter"? If automattic is a
must due to the domain name, how about spam.automattic (pronounced
spamotomatic). It sound malevolent, much like some illicit tools, but given
context, I think it's catchy.

It doesn't need "automattic" or any particular domain in there at all, 
that's all flexible.

It is definitely /comment/ (broadly contribution) spam that's targeted. 
Perhaps
it can be emphasised, assuming non-WordPress prospective users, by choosing
names that reflect on that very fact and are self-contained or
self-explanatory. Something global or already familiar (e.g. Apache's
SpammerAssassin) would have it pros. I can't think of something simple, but
CommentStrainer and CommentSieve are ones that distinguish ASS (dear 
gracious!)
from a typical spam prevention mechanism/service.

I got 11 poker spams this morning.

Now, what happens if the plugin fails to reach the spam service? I  
think in that case, the plugin should moderate the comment. I'd  
rather have the comments go to moderation than ever give spammers  
even 1 second of google page rank.

If the service is does it just does whatever it would do with the 
comment if the plugin didn't exist, which means if you have emergent 
whitelisting or similar enabled it'll be held for moderation.

But if I am installing this as my one and only solution, then I may  
not have the other features activated. Just thinking out loud, but  
that's what I currently have, install plugin, turn on, that's it, no  
other setup required.

That's what I did. If I turn on the keyword blacklisting, does that get
triggered before or after this? Or does that even matter?

Keyword blacklist could potentially conflict with the plugin, and 
there's a lot more potential for false positives when you use it.

    Personally, I think it'd be a good feature to have a "hold for 
moderation if service is not available" option for the plugin.  I 
would use it that way, and not use any other moderation settings if I 
could.
    Of course, that would mean adding an ASS options or manage page, 
but if you did so it could list the stuff it's submitted recently, or 
otherwise be a gateway to finding out just how much it's been doing 
for the author.

A friend dropped a comment on my blog yesterday, and if it was anyone else
I'd have marked it as spam. Now, some of his comments are good, and he does
get around, so I wouldn't want to get him blacklisted with this system but
his posts definately need scrutiny.

If I mark his post as spam what happens if he posts again?

The spam button should only be used for true spam. If you submit your 
friend's comments (or if you submit things accidentally) the system puts 
them in a queue for manual review, and if it's not true spam it won't 
get blacklisted. For people like that it's best to talk to them or add 
them to your personal site blacklist.

Matt said that that the aim is to leave the spammers quivering in their boots.
That given, ass kissing would seem anything _but_ appropriate. *Trying hard to
get a nasty image off mind*

Thanks for leaving that name open to suggestions. Comment spam in general
appears to be getting worse, not judging by personal experience, but also by
what I hear/read. It also continues to become harder to detect. Blacklisting
URL's would probably serve the filters rather well. The rest appears to become
quite some noisy junk.

It's like a neighbour that asks permission to take a dump in your garden. When
the neighbour gets the "no" and a fence is erected, he/she infiltrates, maybe
even asking for toilet paper. In other words, spammers shove the links at all
costs, however vulgar and disturbing the content may be. It's the URL's that
ultimately make a good discriminant.

Just incase Matt's not around for a bit...

The post is in your database - use phpMyAdmin to view the table - probably
called wp_comments

either search on the users email or just sort by the id (twice, to get
descending order) and manually scan. When you find it you'll find one of the
fields is set to 'spam', edit the record and change it to a 0 (unapproved)
or 1 (approved). You will then be able to see it through the admin
interface.

I'm doing some work on the plugin tonight, so I'll see if I can make 
some sort of way to browse spam and submit false positives.

It looks like this was due to mysql being down on Textdrive. I'm 
investigating alternatives.

FYI I just got hammered again with 93 online poker spams. I assume this is
because the service was down again? Since the service is depends on a remote
service, maybe version 2.0 could have a config option to automatically
quarantine comments if the service doesn't repond. Just a thought. Otherwise
I'm ver happy with it.

I've been getting hammered almost non-stop since last night. Is the server
down? At this point I'm going to have to turn off comments until I hear
something.
 
Thanks!

Is anyone else seeing this? Everything seems to be running fine, there 
may be a problem with the plugin on your end. What's your URL?

Weird.

My url is http://www.askderekscruggs.com

Most of the ones I'm getting have the from addresses "weight loss pills,"
"diet pills," "texas holdem," and "online casino"

The online casino one is particularly nasty. About 100 last night another
100 or so this morning.

Okay the plugin is definitely not running for you. I'll put in some 
debugging code so we can track down which comments are being submitted 
to the service and which aren't.

I'm guessing that over time there will be
several versions in the wild, so perhaps adding
a tracker method to the API (that gets called
when the plugin is activated or deactivated)
would provide some extra debug info for cases
like this. Especially if the client could report
it's version number.

phpMyAdmin reveals the truth about how ASS truly is kicking ASS.

To say the least. His site has been down for a few hours. I even 
checked access
via a remote proxy to avoid a hasty statement.

    I definitely think that should be an option.  I know, I've said so 
before, but this is a perfect example of why I think so.  It would be 
even better if, upon the service returning, ASS could run through all 
the quarantined comments automatically.
    The other thing I'd really like to see is a "mark checked comments 
as spam" button on the mass-edit page.  When a run of comments sneaks 
past ASS, as has happened to some here (and me), it's a real pain to 
go through and mark each one individually.  I was lucky: I only had 
23 or so.

For some reason the plug-in is not working for me at all. It has not stopped
a single spam for me since the middle of last week. Is there some way I can
turn on debugging on my end?

If anyone doesn't already have a WordPress.com account send me a note 
offlist and I'll invite you. Within a few days will be moving to the new 
system which is:

* Tweaked and more thorough
* Off of Textdrive which was having DB problems
* Requires a WP.com API key
* No longer called ASS

Michael has also done some cool improvements to the plugin that I'll 
send out with the new URLs as soon as I can.

    So only those with wp.com accounts can make use of the 
spam-stopping system you've been testing?  That seems like a real 
shame to me, doubly so if it means that one can only run it on a 
wp.com blog and not a standalone site.  Maybe I misunderstood, 
though.  Did I?

No, the plugin will require a WP.com API key to work, but you can still 
use it on standalone blogs. Think of it as an authentication key I suppose.
I think it will be a huge boon once spammers try to infect the db with 
fake spams. We'll at least have some sort of paper trail to follow to 
track them down.

Message-ID: <43576F95.5020001@mullenweg.com>

Available for download:

http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/akismet.zip

(Don't publicize that URL just yet. I'd like to get some documentation 
up first.)

Some major updates:

* Now called Automattic Kismet, or Akismet for short
* New servers blah blah
* Requires WP.com API key
* Allows you to review caught spam, and submit false positives
* Deletes spam after 15 days (should clean out those DBs!)
* Is clearer that it submits it to a web service (Podz)
* It may need a day or so to get back to its former effectiveness (or 
lack thereof)
* Shows some stats on your dashboard

Thanks to everyone for your feedback, and Michael for the code. :)

The only thing that didn't make this version is what Eric suggested, 
where if the service is unreachable or down it'll save the comment and 
try it again when a new comment comes in.

Cool! I just installed it and it seems to be working okay. 

However, I tried to mark one spam as "not spam" and received an error about
my api key: 

Your key appears invalid. Double-check it. 

...which I did and it seemed to accept the key fine. Nevertheless, I got
this error every time and the spam status was never changed. 

Also, I just tried deleting all 579 spams in the queue and, though it didn't
display an error, it redirected me to the "enter API key" form and didn't
actually delete the spams.

My wordpress.com username is drumdance, if that's any help in debugging.

Not to mention, you can't actually delete all. The code worked when I sent
it to matt! I'll go through and fix it in the next day or two.

Ditto here. I've been manually stripping out the
spam so I'm only trying to delete 9 messages.

When I hit "Delete All" on the spam page I'm
taken to the "Akismet Configuration" page, and
nothing is removed from the DB.

My key looks fine and I've re-copied it and done
everything twice, just to be sure.

Hi guys.  I'm getting a weird issue with the new plugin -- I disabled
the old plugin and activated the new plugin.  Pasted in the WP.com API
key and looked like the plugin is active.  So I go to manage and I see
I have 3815 spam messages in the database -  I click the 'Delete All'
button and I get taken to the 'Akismet Configuration' page under
plugins.  The spam messages aren't deleted either.  Any ideas?  Thanks

    Sniff, sniff... sob!
    Actually, this is a much more robust version, well worthy of its 
1.0 number.  While it'll probably be necessary to have some sort of 
"hold if service is unavailable" option (since a determined spammer 
could DOS the service while doing a posting run in order to get 
through) that's something that could easily appear in a later version.
    I really like the "Spam (n)" tab; it makes checking for false 
positives a breeze.  Anything that lets me stay far, far away from 
phpMyAdmin is a blessing in my book.

What API key bug? You need to actually enter the API key before it will
work. Once you do enter the API key, then it will stop spam. You still can't
Delete All, but that's another bug entirely.

Here's the first message I sent, right after it was announced:
 
<quote>
Cool! I just installed it and it seems to be working okay. 

However, I tried to mark one spam as "not spam" and received an error about
my api key: 

Your key appears invalid. Double-check it. 

...which I did and it seemed to accept the key fine. Nevertheless, I got
this error every time and the spam status was never changed. 

Also, I just tried deleting all 579 spams in the queue and, though it didn't
display an error, it redirected me to the "enter API key" form and didn't
actually delete the spams.

My wordpress.com username is drumdance, if that's any help in debugging.

</quote>
 
I believe at least one other person is having this problem too.
 
And it it's NOT a bug, then I must be doing something wrong, because it's
not catching any spam. I've been getting hammered all morning. I finally had
to turn on moderation for all comments.

Okay, here's the fix for the Delete All problem.

On line 243, replace the existing line with this:

<form method="post" action="edit.php
?page=akismet/akismet.php&amp;action=delete">

Then you'll be able to Delete All spam.

Matt, please roll this fix into the code. Thanks :)

Derek, I think there's something wrong with your server which causes it 
not to work. My best advice would be to stop using the plugin until we 
can figure out what's up with your platform.

Bummer. It's weird because it worked fine at first, but hasn't since about
two weeks ago.

After installing this new version of Akismet, or whatever the name is
tomorrow, my comment notification emails for pingbacks are showing them to
be "Comments" rather than pingbacks. When I go and actually take a look, the
"comment" is indeed in the database as a pingback.

Akismet is doing great things for me on my various WordPress blogs.
One side-effect that I find especially pleasing is that new spam
(stuff that Akismet doesn't yet recognize as spam) goes to my
moderation queue. If spam is in moderation, it's usually because it is
original or clever enough to have escaped Akismet's keen eye.

This morning I awoke to find a load of spam in the Manage > Spam tab
and two comments in moderation. One was ham and the other, well, I've
copied the text below and submitted it to Akismet as spam. The links
have been removed but they're pretty obvious. What's the best spam
that found its way to your moderation queue?

I do a lot of reviewing of academic papers
before they're published in journals and
conferences.  One of the things we have to
diligently check for is plagiarism.  I found
myself checking the source of the spam text and
it's wordpress.com blog.

http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/11/screams-heard-from-online-bloggers/

If other excerpts turn up, and if visitor IP
addresses are logged, it shouldn't be too hard
to cross reference the data and pinpoint the
culprit.

This morning was the first time I think that my wordpress.com blog was 
hit with the same spams Andy received. 5 of them went into the 
moderation queue though, but I marked them as spam and they went into 
the spam tab - is that enough to send them to Akismet?

I added his IP to the blacklist and the last 2 were marked as Spam. I 
thought that blacklisting stopped the spam dead, without it going into 
moderation? Marking it as spam is good enough for me however :)

This morning I found a lot of spam had been successfully posted on my
wp.com blog. The details are here:
http://andy.wordpress.com/2005/10/21/spam-is-fun-moderation-is-on/

I could see from the quantity and URL that these were spam but Akismet
did not detect them. No big deal, they were easy enough to delete;
however, I was sad that this information would never make its way to
Akismet because there is no way to send approved comments back to
Akismet.

How about an interface to send false negatives back to Akismet?

Andy! I can't believe it! :)

I worked long and hard on the very feature you asked for, and it's already
in Akismet. Just mark the comments as spam, and they'll be sent on.

When something is in the spam interface and you mark it as "not spam" it 
submits it back to Akismet.

Yep! Marking them as spam sends them to Akismet.

I am asking specifically about unwanted comments that were
automatically approved and now appear in the Comments panel and on the
blog. At that point there is no quick way to spamflag multiple
comments. When I click Edit on any single comment, I have the ability
to select the Spam radio button and save it. Will it then be submitted
back to Akismet as spam?

Subject: [spam-stopper] Some spam display improvements?
Message-ID: <435D4A05.9080109@gmail.com>

Hiya

Due to some genius detective work (ok - I googled wordpress.com api key 
and the akismet plugin was second on the list)

I've installed it but don't get massive amounts of traffic so my spam is 
limited.

Anyway I was looking at the stuff it does and the spam list is obviously 
based on cjd_delete mass spam nuke plugin. I've been using that on my 
site for a while and I made some changes to make what it displays more 
useful to me.

For starters the urls often push the page out of shape so I changed the 
commenters name to a link that points to the comment url. The email 
address got turned into a link, the comment count also got turned into a 
link that displays the ip as the link title and links through to the 
arin whois page. The biggest change was adding a snippet of the comment 
content. I figured I can't make a proper assessment of whether a comment 
is spam or not if I can't see what the comment itself is. Not a problem 
when I set a comment as spam, but when wordpress automatically moderates 
posts for me it's nice to see what people are trying to sell.

In case you're interested I've uploaded my changes here : 
http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/preview/cjd_delete.txt

Thanks for your time (and the plugin).

Ben

Looks great; the design suggests
well-ordered-ness and the ability to cope
effortlessly: so thumbs up from aesthetic POV.

Works fine in IE6, FF1.5 and DeerPark-alpha1.

On http://akismet.com/download/ page it may not
be blindingly obvious where to get a
non-commercial key (also true for the FAQ).

Typo on : http://akismet.com/download/
"wp-content" is missing the last "t"

Added!

Also the typos you pointed out have been fixed, and I tried to make the 
rest a little more obvious.

By the way, in case I hadn't mentioned it already, all beta testers from 
this list are being set to the equivalent of an enterprise account 
within the system, free of charge of course. :)

There is only one of these in the submission queue, which came about the 
same time you sent this email.

I'll look into the site, but it's not immediately apparent as spam, it 
seems legit (though ugly) and is not banned by any search engines.

Yeah, that's just it, it SEEMS legit. What they're doing is pulling feeds
for several hundred blogs, sending trackbacks to every new post on the
blogs, and posting a link to those blog entries for about an hour, just long
enough for a blogger (or Spam Karma 2) to find the link, then they drop the
link. Which is why I blocked them in the first place. It's pretty clear, and
slightly more sophisticated, trackback spam.

Howdies all,

I've just received a trackback that has been
marked as spam (with a URI of
http://blog.michaeljosh.com/?p=86).

When I try marking it as "Not spam" I'm told
"Your key appears invalid. Double-check it."

I've checked on wp.com in case my key changed
after yesterday's "you're all lovely; have an
enterprise key" message, but it's still the
same, so I'm out of ideas.

Anyone?

Subject: [spam-stopper] A Potential Delete Problem caused by UI and time lag.
Message-ID: <435FB71E.5080802@boakes.org>

Hi All,

I was describing Akismet to my (Usability
Engineer) wife when she asked a good question.

"If I click Delete, what is deleted?  Is it (a)
all the spam comments that I see before me or
(b) all the spam comments in the database?"

The difference is that there is a time lag
between the page being displayed and the delete
button being pressed.

During that time, comments can arrive and be
marked as spam, so there is potential for
comments to be deleted without review.

The window of opportunity is made larger for
users like me who open lots of tabs and
eventually get round to doing things.  For
example, some hours ago I opened the "Spam(1)"
link in a new tab, and was about to press delete
when I recalled the time-lag issue.

The simplest solution I can see would be to add
the current time then the form is generated, and
then only delete messages from before that time.

Hi All,

If anyone feels this is a big enough issue, then
I believe the enclosed patch for 1.0.3 fixes it.

I've tested it by adding some dummy entries to
the DB and setting some to have dates in the
future.  Only messages whose date is before the
time when the page is served get deleted.

Whilst this takes care of the possibility of
un-reviewed spam getting deleted, it may be
necessary to change the wording so that the
slightly altered behaviour makes sense to the user.

Subject: [spam-stopper] List of required fields?
Message-ID: <20051026181015.30541@smtp.haun-online.de>

Hi,

is there a list of required fields that have to be included when sending
a request to the Akismet web service?

I've managed to produce a working plugin for Geeklog by reverse-
engineering the WordPress plugin, but on closer inspection, it does seem
to send quite a lot of information over the wire.

I can understand that you probably don't want to specify exactly what
Akismet is looking for in a spam post, but the current implementation
(copied and pasted from the WordPress plugin) does send a lot of
obviously unnecessary information, as well as some that raises privacy
and even security concerns.

For example, I assume Akismet doesn't really need to know that my
webserver has PDFlib installed, or in fact, anything about my webserver.
I'm also going to filter out the cookies (session cookies, for example,
are a touchy subject) and would suggest that the WordPress plugin does
the same.

Other than that, I'm pretty excited about this new spam filter and am
eagerly awaiting the next wave of spam posts ;-)

bye, Dirk

All right, we should get this whole privacy thing settled right now, before
either Akismet becomes any larger, or the problem becomes any larger.

Matt, the WordPress plugin sends pretty much everything to the server,
including many things which don't seem to be particularly necessary, like as
Dirk pointed out, the server version.

What do we NEED to be sending, and what can be omitted?

The more you send, the more effective it is.

We do discard some things from $_SERVER, like SERVER_PORT and PATH, but 
the vast majority of it is highly useful. You can remove almost 
everything except the basic comment information and it should work, but 
it won't be nearly as effective.

Matt,

Hmm, how so? My server configuration shouldn't have any relation to the
spam I'm getting.

Oh, I'll happily send along everything I get from the user agent, with
the exception of the cookies and possibly the email address. Bad
Behavior demonstrates quite nicely how that information can be used
effectively.


On a somewhat related note: I have a suspicion that over here in
Germany, I may actually be required by law to inform my users that their
data is sent to some other server (have to look into that). Just as a
reminder that these issues shouldn't be treated lightly ...

bye, Dirk

Hi Dirk, your points got me thinking...

There's was an article on The Register [1] a few
months back where they interviewed a spammer and
he mentioned how he'd go looking for specific
types of blog to target - if there is a
vulnerability in a particular blog with a
particular version of php, and a particular
library, then you can bet it'll be targeted.  As
spam gets harder to deliver it becomes more
necessary to target such layered vulnerabilities.

If I were to write the same system, I'd give it
as much information as possible.  What is
probably necessary therefore is a UI that allows
the user to choose how much info gets sent.

In some respects the data is already being sent
to another server, because it's going from the
web server to the MySQL server; but I assume you
mean a machine owned by a third party, in which
case: what's the difference between the third
party machine and any web client that would
download the page and read the comment?  IMO
there is no difference, but then, IANAL.

Different servers interact with different types of user agents in 
distinct ways.

That'll definitely help.

Sounds okay to me.

Maybe clarify the "may be stored for a time" somewhat. Not in terms of
duration but by adding "to help improve the accuracy of the filters" or
words to that effect.

It's not that simple. Consider a site where comments can only be seen by
logged-in users (not sure if that's possible with WordPress, but it
surely is with Geeklog). In that case it's not clear if by posting a
comment the submitter also implictly approved it being scanned by an
unknown (to him) third party.

After thinking some more about it, I think it's not really a problem,
but I'm going to look into it anyway, just to be sure ...

* New comments on your blog are submitted to the Akismet web service
                                ^^^^^^^^^

Might want to change this to "(temporarily) viewable to Akismet (engine)"?
"Submitted" sounds as if comments might be published (mirrored). You 
might want
to stress that it's a bot, as opposed to a person that retains the comments.

* We are profoundly uninterested in reading your comments.

Negation can be misleading and "profoundly" might be a difficult word 
for those
whose English is poor.

* Stats about comment flow may be published.

Maybe add the word "global" at the start? Scrambling of stats leads to
obscurity.


* We collect server stats, API usage.

"We" -> "Akismet"? "We" sounds like people are directly involved.


I begin to ponder the use of more brute force by spammers. Let's remember that
higher bandwidth is made available in more locations and zombies are 
becoming a
plague since they are being used as proxies. I can observe over 1,000 zombie
attack on my site every day. Will the main sufferers of brute force 
spamming be
users without Akismet? The spammers need to produce a certain amount output
(links) so might take it up a notch, if needed to make ends meet.

Judging by the effect of rel="nofollow", it's reasonable to believe that
spammers might /not/ try harder. They probably feed the most on blogs that are
no longer maintained.

Is there an effect? I get hammered now more than ever, even though I've had
nofollow in place since it was first announced. Has anyone made an effort to
measure this?

Well, tonight for example, one of my sites has been getting hit every few
minutes while the other was neglected. Judging by what I hear in the
newsgroups, it only gets worse, just like you said. Many posts/enquiries
address spam and nothing but spam. The spamming scripts, once owned by a few,
are proliferated (maybe exponentially), leter to hit new blog, which are
created every 1 second (c/f BBC). Script kiddies have been elvated to become
script Gods.

Some would argue that all presently-maintained Web applications 
incorporate the
rel="nofollow" attribute by default. Some would would also argue that within a
few years, as the Web evolves, any Wiki, guestbook and the like should have
protection built-in. Then again, there will always always remain innocent
surfers who follow such spammy links, so there is still incentive for the
spammers. Moreover, not all sites evolve and some are no longer maintained.
Remember that not everything gets upgraded. There is a graveyard 'trail'.

What about the words contained within comments, which then get indexed and can
boost a brand name? For the spammers to stop knocking on 
rel="nofollowed" sites
is /not/ worth the investigation effort. They don't care if you have 
filters or
rel="nofollow" in place, so as long as some people resist it or stay exposed,
it'll get worse. The best solution: make filtering as autonomous as possible.

In summary, it seems like link spam attempts are here to stay, forever. The
author of ABC of SEO < http://www.abcseo.com/papers/referrer-spam.htm > agreed
with me on this speculation. It's too late to annul the effect of link-reliant
algorithms. If Web 2.0 is about involvement, it also involves some malevolent.

From newsletter at scytheman.net  Sun Oct 30 00:43:06 2005
From: newsletter at scytheman.net (Sebastian Herp)
Date: Sun, 30 Oct 2005 02:43:06 +0200
Subject: [spam-stopper] Akismet vs. Spamkarma2 (a solution)
Message-ID: <4364171A.2070405@scytheman.net>

Hello list,

first I'd like to introduce myself. I am the average blogger 
(www.sebbi.de) from Germany and recent follower of the Spamkarma2 cult. 
As of now this plugin has never let me down and kept blogging fun 
despite all the spam I receive.

When Matt announced Akismet on his blog I got very excited about the 
idea and had some privacy issues with it. Of course that is relatively 
stupid, because hey ... it's the internet and Google already knows about 
all the comments on my blog ... so what the heck ;-) (but I am still 
wondering why everything that is contained in the array "$_SERVER" has 
to be send to Akismet ... that is a lot more than "just the comment").

Whatever ...

Some bloggers are posting about their switch from Spamkarma to Akismet 
and which one would be better and blabla. I tested Akismet and found it 
to be not worthy to be my only protection, but I know it would 
eventually learn from all the submissions and get better with time. On 
the other side is Spamkarma which is pretty much perfect and can be 
extended to become even more perfect! So I wrote a Spamkarma2 Plugin 
which checks comments against Akismet.com and submits them to their 
database if it's clearly spam or ham. That way Spamkarma improves and 
the Akismet database should also improve ... without user interaction 
and immediatly.

It's currently beta, but works as advertised.

Get it here: http://www.sebbi.de/files/sk2_akismet_plugin.zip

Unzip it into "wp-content/plugins/SK2/sk2_plugins" and enter your 
Wordpress Apikey into "General Settings"->"Akismet Check" in Spamkarma2. 
You can tweak some other advanced settings too if you want (please tell 
me about what works best for you). There is currently no other 
documentation for this plugin plugin (a plugin of a plugin ... oh my 
god!), but I don't it's needed. The concept is simple enough ;-)

Feel free to test it and I'm happy about every feedback I can get. If 
nothing bad comes up (the plugin being a server killer or something), 
I'll release that code to the public this week.

@Matt: the original wordpress-plugin caries no license information. So 
I'd like to know if it is ok to borrow some of the code from it, because 
I have done so. Is it ok?

Greetings and happy halloween,
Sebastian Herp
