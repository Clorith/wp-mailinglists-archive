Subject: [spam-stopper] question about blacklist
Message-ID: <CANnqDuJ7FXzdh3f8N_s_mrqBQciyTW73S11RFOVej5M713quNQ@mail.gmail.com>

On some blog where I post, that have akismet installed, my comment is
never publish.

Any way exist to see if I am on blacklist and why?

I never post spam so I would like to know why all my comment go in spam box.
