Subject: [spam-stopper] Stop spam registrations - please advice for our site
Message-ID: <CAPxdvt7F8P9V14P1A3qQgHJtZnGcoGbSxRR=Rcj8YE1U_u4YxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I'm wanting to use akismet API to stop smap registrations, here is signup
page:
http://www.yogahub.com/profiles/registerlight

I can pass email and username, IP, user_agent, referer etc etc,
but what must I pass for "content to be checked".
Is it good idea to pass "<first name> <last name>" string concatenation
and are there chances it will be correctly checked and not spammed because
it simply contains their real names?

Please advice.

Regards,
