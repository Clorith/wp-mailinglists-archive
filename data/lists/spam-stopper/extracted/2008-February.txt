Subject: [spam-stopper] PHP5 Akismet API is in PEAR
Message-ID: <1203642546.15934.5.camel@localhost>

Hello All,

I'd like to let you know about a new PHP 5 implementation of the Akismet
REST API. The package, Services_Akismet is MIT licensed and distributed
through the official PEAR channel at
http://pear.php.net/package/Services_Akismet.

Hopefully this will make it even easier for third-party PHP projects to
use Akismet spam tools. The code is well documented and should "just
work" on any PHP 5.2.1+ system.

Thanks for the great API,


-Mike

Subject: [spam-stopper] Akismet Server Problems with HTTP/1.1
Message-ID: <854668C8-0C6E-45E2-8364-F78FC5200C73@defv.be>

Hello,

While investigating a slow site for a client I found out the akismet  
servers + PHP5 seem to have a problem with HTTP/1.1, which makes  
replies sometimes really slow. I did a write-up on this on http://blog.defv.be/2008/2/22/akismet-problems 
  .

Subject: [spam-stopper] Release - Akismet for MediaWiki
Message-ID: <57959.75.157.224.152.1204327850.squirrel@scribblewiki.com>

Hello,

I run a small wiki hosting company that uses MediaWiki as its base and 
after CAPTCHA and other extensions made were no longer working we created
our own Akismet extention.  It currently doesn't have system for someone
to check spam marked by Akismet to correct false positives; but, we are
working on a system similar to the current Wordpress mod to do that.

You can download it at http://scribblewiki.com/akismet/  The code is
released under the GPL.
