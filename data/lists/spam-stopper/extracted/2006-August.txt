Subject: [spam-stopper] Problems - nothing getting caught today

Hi

Just wondering if there's a problem with the server or a sudden influx of
clever spammers because I've been hammered today - when normally I get to
live in blissful ignorance.

The Akisment server is down. In my application (not WP blog) I'm 
using a modified version of the PHP4 class that gives me an error 
status whenever Akismet doesn't respond. And I've been seeing no 
connects for some number of hours now.

Doesn't bother me though. If my application can't connect with 
Akismet the comment goes into a moderation queue.

I'm pretty relaxed about it too, I hope the server comes up again, but I'd
rather it was a server down issue than that the spammers had found a way
around Akismet - that would be awful!!!

thanks for the speedy reply Richard ;)

I just tracked this down, because of a bug in the new stats thing. It 
should be fixed now, let me know if you're still seeing any spam.
