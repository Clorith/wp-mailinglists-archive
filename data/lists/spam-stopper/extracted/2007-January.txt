Subject: [spam-stopper] invalid return from submit-ham
Message-ID: <5c5e94900701061549x7a748124q7b01f4eebe8cb578@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

today I noticed, that when I call the submit-ham method, it returns
"Thanks for making the web a better place." But according to the
documention, it should return either "valid" or "invalid." Or did I
miss something?

Regards,
Thomas

submit-ham and submit-spam never say no, unless you have an invalid key. 
They're easy.

Subject: [spam-stopper] Release: PHPBB Akismet Mod
Message-ID: <9e771ea90701120409n6b8541f2t52cc8c6576d1e41f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I run a few forums and the spammers really like messing with them and
unfortunately the only Akismet PHPBB mod was abandoned.

On my forums I use a PHPBB mod called Spam Words (
http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=354376 ) which
blocks/queues posts based on a keyword blacklist. However the list of
keywords can get very large and hard to maintain.

I've made a mod for this mod to add akismet support. It was quite
simple because the Spam Words mod has all the queuing/moderation code,
so it was just a matter of hooking into the check_spam() function.

If anyone is interested in implementing this onto their forum, the
code and instructions are at
http://www.eadz.co.nz/blog/article/phpbb-akismet.html

In the future I hope to work with the Spam Words developer to get this
added into his mod.

Best Regards
Eaden McKee
