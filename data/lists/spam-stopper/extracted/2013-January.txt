Subject: [spam-stopper] Askimet plugin for CakePHP
Message-ID: <CAJvctpSFUFSUny8W_TkN9RGDPHavcxTC0wXTDV55FHKO7Yc4JQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have created an Askimet Component for CakePHP. It is currently on Github
and you check it out at:
https://github.com/mcloide/CakePHP-Askimet-Component

It is not widely known at the moment but since this is a developers list
thought it would be good to throw the info out there.
