Subject: [spam-stopper] A small akismet extension for separating ham from
	spam
Message-ID: <448063D4.5040709@boakes.org>

Hi Folks,

For me, Akismet was great at first because it 
identified the spam, and (although rare) when 
there were false positives, there was only 10:1 
spam ratio so the real messages were really obvious.

The recent upsurge in comments (and thus the 
upsurge in Akismet's quarry) has had a 
detrimental knock-on effect on the ease of 
separating ham from spam.

The task of spotting a piece of false-positive 
ham in the middle of hundreds of spams is no 
different to what we were doing before, manually 
sifting through every message - the only change 
is that instead of looking for "ham to accept" 
we now have to look for "ham to de-spam".

To improve this I added a "Worst Offenders" 
section to the 1.15 version of Akismet.  It 
lists the IP addresses and domains that appear 
most frequently, and allows the user to delete 
these en-masse, reducing the amount of spam/ham 
filtering to a far more manageable amount.

It's manageable on my site anyway, your mileage 
may differ.

The updated plugin is here:
http://boakes.org/download/akismet-1.15-wo.zip

It hopefully proves that such a system is fairly 
useful, and might give people a few ideas for 
better solutions.

Thinking forward I was considering two avenues 
of development that might be useful:

(1) combine the worst-offenders IP addresses 
with the existing WP capability to write the 
.htaccess file, thus having a dynamic deny list 
that targets active spam-bots.

(2) to allow more experimentation, the Akismet 
size of things could be made a bit more 
pluggable with filters triggered when the spam 
page is submitted and displayed.  This could 
enable akismet plugin-lets to provide more 
intelligent management functions (like this one) 
without having to update the core plugin).

Anyway; food for thought and a plugin to play 
with.  Hope it's useful :)

Rich

Hello everyone,

Just letting you guys know that I'm working on an Akismet  
MODification for phpBB. I'm hoping to make an alpha release of the  
code this week, however I do have a Subversion repository set up with  
the dev code. The support topic for the MOD can be found here: http://

Hi,

I believe that a fairly complete list is *this*:

http://akismet.com/development/

There may, however, be implementations that were not brought to Automattic's
attention or simply not added to the list yet.

You may be able to use one of the existing GPL'd implementations (many to
choose from) as a starting point which works well with the API's and hooks.

Hope it helps,

Roy

If I may add a suggestion/request:

A key to filtering in phpBB  might also be  that of excluding and moderating
memberships, which have become detrimental.  I don't truly know how this can
be achieved without unwanted consequences, but I look forward to seeing some
solution to phpBB SPAM.

The difficult parts are getting together the information that is sent  
to Akismet from phpBB (since Akismet is intended for blogs, not  
fora), but I am working it out. So far, I'm working on a basic system  
where the admin can choose to check all comments for spam, only check  
unregistered comments for spam, or not check any comments for spam.  
I'm hoping in future versions I can extend this to allow more  
advanced control using phpBB's authentication system.

A couple of points spring to mind:

	(1) Forum messages are different from comments/posts, so the Akismet
	    filter can wind up rather baffled, handling a mashmash of diffe-
	    rent 'processes' (merging Apples and Oranges). I wonder how this
	    would ever be extended (if ever) to something such as E-mail

	(2) Whatever you do to facilitate Akismet interfaces,  please ensure
	    it  is not consistent with phpBB's  clunky and totally  unusable
	    administration panel. Keep it Simple and Stupid (KISS), just li-
	    ke WordPress.

Best wishes,

Roy

Message-ID: <001001c68aa9$d9a197f0$0100a8c0@m00>

Hi!

I would like to mention that I've been working on an Akismet module for
Drupal 4.7. It is not finished, but all basic features are already
implemented. Details can be located here:

http://www.phpmix.org/story/protected_by_akismet#comment-68


I'm also trying to keep the Drupal community informed about its progress
from this post:

http://drupal.org/node/50502


The stable page for this project is located here:

http://www.phpmix.org/projects/drupal/4_7/akismet


where a package is already available for testing, in beta stage. While I'm
polishing the code and adding some late features, I'm open suggestions. I'm
for making it as good as the WP plugin. :-)


I would like to avail the oportunity to thank all people involved in the
creation and maintenance of Akismet. This service has been a really great
idea. Also, thanks for opening it to non-WP platforms. Let's fight
against'em together!


Regards,
Markus

Further to my thinking aloud [1] about combining 
the "Worst Offenders" hack with automated 
htaccess modification, I bashed out a rough copy 
today [2] and the results have been promising.

Basically when you the user deletes an IP 
address based offender from Akismet they have 
the option of banning that address from 
connecting in future.

I think this potentially saves each server (and 
the Akismet service) from an awful lot of work.

A similar approach: I've ported Bad Behavior for Geeklog and when
Geeklog's spam filter detects spam, it can optionally report the
spammer's IP address to Bad Behavior. So it's Bad Behavior doing the
blocking, instead of the .htaccess.


>I think this potentially saves each server (and

It's not quite as successful as one may think, as spammers often use
botnets or open proxies all over the place, so that identical spam is
often coming from a lot of different IP addresses.

One possible advantage over (/assistance to) PHP 
based solutions (such as Bad Behavior) is that 
it works at the server level, so the 403 is sent 
before PHP is invoked.

This may be particularly useful where 
performance is important, but can also be 
considered a disadvantage because whilst the 
concept is portable, the htaccess file is not.

One thing that might mitigate this problem is 
that the IP addresses this plugin blocks are 
ones that are we know are targeting the blocking 
blog, so the success ratio should be "better 
than random".

That said, I have no preconceptions about how 
successful it will be; but that's what I hope to 
find out!

So far I've seen > 90% reduction in the need to 
ask Akismet for help.  Perhaps someone on the 
server side can have a look at the stats from my 
ID to see if the difference remains significant 
and useful over time.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0606111534080.20671@perthimc.asn.au>


Hey guys,

Im having a bit of a problem with damn spammers. I run a little community
site, and its a 4yo homecrafted CMS , and its absolutely getting hammered.
To the point its grotesquely inflated the hosting costs , let alone the
hundreds of manhours hunting and pruneing the thousands of idiotic
ringtone type spams. I keep adding little measures in, right up to MD5
signatures and the lot, and they keep getting around it.

Anyway, I want to give akismet a go.

Now to do this I need the php4 library. Problem is the link off the
akismet site is dead, and it appears the author has closed his website,

Has anyone a copy of this library. Im planning to modify the lib so if it
catches spammers, it returns a wonderful file I have thats a 1 gig gzipped
string of zeros (and a html header) zipped into 1 meg. My experiments show
it'll kill every browser it encounters and probably most bots. If that
doesnt work Im prepared to code a teergrub module for apache (Starts to
send a header then falls asleep. The bot ends up stuck there for hours on
end waiting for its process to end).

Cheers,
Shayne.

After several days of work and tests here at phpMiX.org, I'm proud to
announce the immediate availability of about 2000 lines of code compiled
into "Akismet module v1.0.0 for Drupal 4.7".

In just a few words, when new content is submitted to a Drupal based site,
the akismet module sends a real time request to Akismet.com. If it isn't
spam, the content is published, if it is, then it is placed on to the
moderation queue. Moderators may opt-in to receive e-mail notifications for
all content, just content needing approval or nothing at all. The module is
fully customizable, almost everything is optional. It also keeps track of a
counter that you can use to show your visitors how many spam has been caught
by Akismet in your site.

I have also implemented a quite simple method to check for updates at
certain intervals, which is customizable from the settings panel. It can
also be disabled.

For a complete list of features, support resources and download, please
visit the project page for the "Akismet module for Drupal" at:

Bests to all,
Markus

Earlier today I spoke with Eric Hammond of 
notlong.com after receiving a topside of spam 
that was using notlong as a redirection service; 
he's very quickly killed off the misused URLs 
(thanks Eric).

Services such as notlong would benefit greatly 
if they could access a list of spammed URLs so 
they could disable them before they can be 
profited from, and it seems that Akismet.com is 
well placed to provide such a service.

Eric had all kinds of other questions when I 
mentioned that akismet was able to stop the spam 
before it got through; questions I can't answer 
such as:

> What specifically is known to akismet.com?  The specific notlong.com 
> URLs or the long URLs where they get redirected?  Are you sure 
> akismet.com is not simply blocking all notlong.com URLs?

If anyone can furnish Eric with non-speculative 
answers then I'm sure he'll be delighted; but in 
the meantime I thought I'd moot the idea of an 
API for checking if your domain has been used 
for spam.

Perhaps it'd be nice to make some system where service providers (stuff 
like blogger or the commercial wordpress providers, and stuff like the 
notlong and tinyurl, etc, etc, stuff , can get a perhaps xml-rpc type 
notification that their service is getting abused in some way.

Like if akismet , however the heck its working internally, goes "Ok, this 
url http: //makewangbigger.blogger.com is a spam url" then if could fire 
off an xml-rpc notification that that url is being abused and then blogger 
or whatever could go "ok. This notification is comming from akismet, we 
trust akismet, time to nuke it".

It'd have to be formalised, and with propper measures to avoid abuse (for 
instant people putting in bogus requests against political opponent blogs, 
or whatever). But basically if there was a way to knock the spammers right 
off the large commercial services, then that'll make the spammers job ALOT 
more expensive and harder.

Message-ID: <002701c69161$cc3a8400$0100a8c0@m00>

Since I announced and released the Akismet module for Drupal, I have
observed that my site is now target for some spambots, hence I have now a
bit more food for testing :-(

I'm adding now a few more features to the module and I'm also thinking about
adding some kind of measures to prevent from having small DoS periods due to
spambots generating all the extra work involved in checking with Akismet,
sending e-mail notifications to spam moderators or whatever.

I guess it is important for Akismet to get as much information as possible
about spam (even if it is known), so I'm not thinking about adding heavy
algorithms locally or adding permanent bans (using Bad Behavior kind of
tools nor .htaccess)...

What I've been thinking is the fact that we may have spam in the moderation
queue. This is volatile information because it will be removed by a cron
task based on expiration (defined by module options). However, this is
information that we could perhaps use to checker before sending a request to
Akismet, and ban if the IP of a new attempt to post a comment matches the IP
of one of those items in the queue, or if the text of the comment matches
(good when spambots use proxies), or if URLs (full or only the host) in the
text matches, etc.

That is, I'm thinking just about measures against spambots. Simple checks
that could be made against known spam that we may have for a short period of
time in the queue. I'm currently coding a new version of the module, I would
love to hear thoughts or suggestions about that. :-)

One possible advantage over (/assistance to) PHP
based solutions (such as Bad Behavior) is that
it works at the server level, so the 403 is sent
before PHP is invoked.

This may be particularly useful where
performance is important, but can also be
considered a disadvantage because whilst the
concept is portable, the htaccess file is not.

One thing that might mitigate this problem is
that the IP addresses this plugin blocks are
ones that are we know are targeting the blocking
blog, so the success ratio should be "better
than random".

That said, I have no preconceptions about how
successful it will be; but that's what I hope to
find out!

So far I've seen > 90% reduction in the need to
ask Akismet for help.  Perhaps someone on the
server side can have a look at the stats from my
ID to see if the difference remains significant
and useful over time.

Funny you should mention that; I've started 
coding it twice already (my plan was rewrite the 
htaccess file so that any any IP address with 
more than n comments in the unmoderated spam 
queue would get a 403, this is in addition to 
the existing 403 ban that I'd set up), but I 
stopped short both times, realising that it's 
probably more useful to suggest some changes to 
the plugin first, so such experiments can be 
attempted by listening for akismet hooks, rather 
than extending the plugin itself.

So here's a straw man describing the kind of 
hooks that would be useful:

  spam page being shown
  spam page being submitted
  comment checked and it's spam
  comment checked and it's not spam
  comment submitted for despam
  comment submitted as spam
  spam comment is deleted

Off the top of my head those would be a good 
start and (assuming the comment is passed as a 
parameter for each), and should make further 
spam-stopping experiments a bit easier.

I might have missed something glaringly obvious 
though, hence this thinking aloud.

hmm... adding hooks might also add certain overhead, which is what I'm
trying to avoid. On the other hand, hooks might be more easy to extend,
adapt... hmm...

I'm mostly concerned about doing something (if at all possible simple) to
minimize Denial of Service situations when a spambot is having a go with a
particular site.

Since I have a couple more feaures ready to release for Akismet module for
Drupal (this week-end, if life permits), I'll be adding something simple now
and see what happens. :-)

Subject: [spam-stopper] Reporting spammers to their ISP
Message-ID: <001201c6954d$db38f000$0100a8c0@m00>

Hi all!

I was getting close to 0 spam in my site, but since I released Akismet
module for Drupal I'm getting one or two, heh. Not a problem because Akismet
is catching them all. However, most of this spam is sent from a single
spambot, from where I've been learning a bit about their practices.

Some facts and observations:

a) They seem to use a custom HTTP client, that supports cookies so it is
able to keep the PHP session alive. This is a must when comment preview is
required before being able to submit the comment.

b) They send the spam from different IPs that may or may not be proxies.
Some of them seem to be ordinary PCs (just guessing now, probably infected
with a trollan or something similar). I have also observed that they have
been monitoring the attack by doing manual requests from behind a proxy.
Probably because their automated engine was getting a few errors :P

c) They use real e-mail addresses from a known free e-mail provider. I know
this because I'm using a module that checks the MX records to get the list
of mail servers and connects to them to check if the e-mail is valid.

d) They tend to fill in the homepage field of the comment with the URL of
the advertised site (or one of them).

e) I have also observed that they reuse the same IPs and e-mail addresses to
deploy different attacks, even when these attacks are happen in different
days. It seems no one is reporting to the corresponding ISPs abuse of these
resources ...hmm... or abuse report resolutions are taking a lot of time...


So I was thinking...

There is little we can do to break their clients. There are even programable
HTTP clients that support javascript, so they can easily emmulate whatever a
user would be required to do.

However, I wonder if there is something we could do to stop them use the
same IPs, e-mail addresses and advertised sites again and again. It might be
hard, but we are a lot more than them.

Would it be possible to join efforts to document procedures to report their
activities to the involved ISPs and/or e-mail providers. If we really could,
I believe, they would have to spend a lot more money trying to renew those
resources that we could eventually stop.

Akismet is great, but maybe there is something more that we all could do?

Any thoughts or experiences reporting spammers out there? What if we join
efforts in this direction?


Cheers
Markus

The key would be to develop an automated system to report the  
relevant information to the appropriate abuse channel at the ISP. I  
would think that the best place to start is to work with ISPs who are  
known to be strongly anti-Spam to develop the infrastructure and  
protocols and then try to get it adopted as a standard more or less.  
Akismet could then feed the information to the ISPs when spam was  
caught, but it would also allow other filters and systems to submit  
to them as well.

The key would be to aggregate the complaints until they reached some  
threshold that the ISP felt was worth dealing with then submitting.  
So you'd want to work out with an ISP that once the aggregator got  
500 or 5000 or 5,000,000 spams from the abused accounts they would  
then stop the abuse.

Probably the major goal of comment spammers is to increase their site ranks
in search engines, etc. So... all that is needed is a coordinated effort to
remove their sites from search engine databases.

I would like to post here the links to report abuse to Google and Yahoo!

http://www.google.com/contact/spamreport.html
http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/deletions/deletions-07.html

I even thought to add something to the Akismet module for Drupal to help
site administrators fill in those forms. However, it would be really great
if Akismet itself could provide more information or even coordinate such
abuse reports.

The idea would be make the job of those who deal with abuse reports easier.

Anyone with experience reporting comment spam to Google, Yahoo! or others?

Let me know how the initial tests are, I have a couple ideas about how 
Akismet could be tweaked to work better with wiki-type content, but 
there isn't much data around it yet.

I guess the biggest thing would be experimenting with just sending the 
added text, rather than the whole page.

If you can, please send a "comment_type" of "wiki".

That's what I am doing. Sending the whole page
may penalize existing URLs. Once I am done, I'll
publish a Perl module, perhaps Net::Akismet::Wiki.

Will do.

Hey , thats a smart idea. I've seen some wiki's brutalised BADLY by 
spammers (My old one was effectively destroyed, it was a hand coded one 
for a one-off and had no real defenses).

I might have a stab at building an akismet module for phpwiki (nice one, 
think media-wiki lite), seeing as its a pretty damn easy wiki to hack.

Also, status report: I integrated akismet with activismo, a CMS designed 
for the "indymedia" political-left open publishing sites, and its working 
a charm. Heck I'm even getting my afternoons back. It unfortuntately 
reports 127.0.0.1 to the akismet system, but thats an unfortunate side 
effect of a apache setup custom hacked to remove all IP logging for user 
security sake. It still works a treat. One or two misses, but thats well 
better than a couple hundred spams a day.

Akismet has been working well for filtering the Wiki-spam in Trac.
We're using the Python difflib module to extract only the new content
from the pending edit to test for spam.  We do still maintain a list of
some regex patterns to block when certain items seem to be slipping
through Akismet, but this is fairly rare.

Subject: [spam-stopper] Akismet.com Support for Serendipity!
Message-ID: <3276.217.76.101.162.1151483349.squirrel@supergarv.dyndns.org>

Hi!

Some time ago (April) we implemented Akismet.com support into Serendipity
(www.s9y.org). I used the contact form on the akismet development page to tell
you about that support.

Until now, the development page on http://akismet.com/development/ doesn't list
that fact, and I would like to know what needs to be done to get listed there?
Other blog applications apart from WordPress seem to be listed there as well, so
I suppose that's no issue, right? ;-)

Thanks for your great service,
Garvin
