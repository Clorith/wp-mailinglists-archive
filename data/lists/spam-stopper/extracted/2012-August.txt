Hi

Is this list still monitored by the Akismet crew?

I'm a moderator on a pretty big vbulletin forum that uses akismet for
moderation. We have an issue with cookie stuffing via broken images in the
bbcode.

Akismet occassionally catches the first post but the user is then free to
post another dozen or so bad images. They own a stash of crappy .info
domains which get reused so we catch most but its tough catching them all.
We know that if they start being blocked they'll probably start making
clean posts until they are past the moderation threshold but the IPs don't
change alot so there are still footprints to catch them on.

If you would like examples let me know and I can undelete some etc

Thanks

Sarah
