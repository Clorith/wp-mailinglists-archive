First off I wanted to thank everyone to volunteering to try out this 
experiment and help out with everything.

Before getting started, I should point out a few things:

* Please deactivate all other spam plugins and clear your blacklists
* In the beginning you *will* get more spam, as the system starts to learn
* The idea is that you will get drastically less after a few days
* When spam does get through mark it as "spam" in the WP interface and 
it'll be submitted back for review and it'll protect other members of 
the network.

Without further ado, the plugin is attached. It's a standard upload and 
activate job, no configuration right now.

Subject: [spam-stopper] How it works
Message-ID: <432FAEC8.3010302@mullenweg.com>

When a comment comes in it submits its data to the spam service, which 
then runs a number of checks tests on it and compares it to its list of 
(literally) hundreds of thousands of spams.

It returns back a thumbs up or down.

If the service is down or unreachable it doesn't change the moderation 
value of the comment.

The secret sauce is a team of highly trained monkeys who can swat spam 
with their tails while typing.

Feel free to post any questions or comments to this list. I have one 
more email for the getting-started onslaught.

Assuming this whole things works, and we don't know if it will yet, I'm 
still figuring out how to make it self-sustaining in the long term.

The obvious answer is to have it be a paid-only service, so all costs 
are covered from the beginning, but I really feel like the web needs 
serious help with comment spam, and charging for basic protection isn't 
going to make the web a better place.

I would be more comfortable with something where it was free for regular 
people, and only businesses or enterprises paid (enough to support 
everybody).

There may be "keys" or accounts at some point to prevent abuse.

However the plugin and API are designed to be pretty easy to recreate, 
so if someone wanted to run their own spam service they could easily.

I think that's some great imagery to start the project off with. :)

By the time we're done spammers around the world will quiver in their boots.

The system is designed to err on the side of no false positives, but 
especially over the next couple of weeks we're going to be watching the 
comment stream manually and tweaking things if any false positives come 
through. (There have been none thus far.)

I may be the only person who doesn't know how to do it, but I figure if 
I don't, there's probably at least one other person who is out here with 
me, so I'll be the one who bares my ignorance and asks the question.

I've been using Spam Karma, just upgraded to SK2 today actually. (Effort 
that could have been spent elsewhere?) I *think* I cleared my blacklist 
by going to the Manage SK2 page, then Blacklist, then removed all the 
entries in the list. But I want to make sure that's all I needed to do. 
I'd like to be testing this the right way, you know?

There were only 20 entries -- but I'm thinking that's just because I 
just upgraded to SK2 today, as I get about 30 spam comments a day 
usually, so surely there would have been more entries before -- is there 
something else I need to clear from the previous version of SK?

Glad to help test, and thanks for any answers in advance!

You should deactivate any other plugins on the plugin screen. Once 
they're deactivated you shouldn't have to worry about them.

Under Options > Discussion there is your built-in WP mod list and 
blacklist, you should clear that out too.

I am sure that many people will voluntarily donate a pittance, especially
bearing in mind what a hassle the project saves them from.

I was thinking along the same lines. BSD springs to mind.

You mean "anti-spam", right? *smile*

API's that are too open would also allow the (more cunning among the) spammers
to shrewdly prepare spam that penetrates. Be careful. For the same reasons
(among others, e.g. competition), big G will not reveal their special recipe.
SEO's can really muck up the SERP's as one /recent/ story shows <

Moose feels strange dropping his pants....now that's a first ;)

Btw, Hi Craig!

I am going to try this on blog #2 first, then if all seems well, I  
will go with blog #1 as well. Do I have to be on WP 1.5.2? I will  
need to upgrade the blog.

This sounds a bit like the old spam service which I tested, which was  
helpful.

I cleared my moderation list, so that blog is as vulnerable as a  
newborn doe. I didn't clear Spam Karma 2 out, just turned it off.  
That way if I find it necessary to switch back, I should be ok. I  
don't think this should skew results in anyway.

In the words of those famous cockroaches "Rrrraaaaaiiiiiiidddddd!"

You need to be on at least 1.5, the latest version probably wouldn't hurt.

Thanks for letting me join .. should I disable Enhanced View? It's not a 
spam plugin but it lets you view blacklisted comments.

I currently have moderation set up for people who don't have approved  
comments, or comments that have more than five links. I also have a  
pretty long list of terms that cause comment to get put  in the  
moderation queue.  Do I need to turn these options off as well as  
clear the moderation list in order to use this plugin?

I would leave the first one, but clear out your long list of terms. You 
shouldn't need it any more.

Just tweaked the matching a bit more, it seems to be catching a lot more

By tomorrow it should be running close to full-speed for everyone who

It is an interesting problem how to pay for these sorts of things. Its too
bad you can't leverage the mass adoption a la Bit Torrent and have
everyone who uses it foot part of the cost in terms of server resources,
which is most likely going to be the bulk of expense.

Out of curiosity, and I am thinking off the top of my head here, is there
any reason why the system couldn't be setup as a hybrid local/remote?
Basically, each client hosts a local version which checks the spaminess of
a comment and if it is spam, rejects it locally, possibly creating some
kind of update record to send on periodically to the main site (though if
it is already detectable as spam, I don't know if that would be of any
use) and if a comment passes the local spam check only those get sent on
to the remote server? If they are flagged as spam by the remote, the
remote must have better data to check against so an update is run?

Should keep the overal server needs down, if it is feasible.

If the cost of spam exceeded the cost of preventing spam, then I might pay
for it. But currently there are effective free spam tools out there
(including my own two little hands deleting the crud flood) so I doubt I'd
pay for the service at this juncture, but I am sure there are those who
would. I would be totally willing to include a link as payment if that was
asked. I'm a little annoyed that Ethan Zohn (Survivor Africa Winner) uses
WordPress and stripped out the credits (http://eZhon.com and my post
about:
http://somuchgeek.com/2005/09/18/survivor-africa-winner-ethan-uses-wordpress/)

I just checked my blog and 4 poker posts had got through. 

How do we know that the plugin is actually working? does it stamp or log 
anything locally? Can you check at your end that you're getting input from 
my blog?

Nothing so far on any of my blogs.

Don't know whether that's a result of my having comments turned off on 
older posts for all that time. I've turned comments back on now.

So either the spammers are active and it's working, or else the spammers 
aren't hitting me at the moment, and we can't really tell.

I'm getting spam still, though not as many as normal. Using the 
auto-moderate plugin, I would expect 100-200 spams a day.  I would 
estimate 50 that I've marked as spam today.

Subject: [spam-stopper] Spam-stopper Back-end
Message-ID: <20050921065852.ukyrmxbll90c408w@banana.catalyst2.com>

I have looked at the code quite thoroughly, noticing that URL's of sites get
recorded. This introduces the interesting possibility of getting spam
statistics, as well as the possibility of tracking blogs. By all means, it is
not something that bothers me.

I also notice that filter output is binary, i.e. accept or reject. A
Spamassassim-like ranking mechanism is worth considering in the future (at the
cost of complexity). Regardless:

I am curious as to what happens at the back-end. Is it something which ought to
remain undisclosed at present?

	$comment['user_ip']    = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
	$comment['user_agent'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
	$comment['referrer']   = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];
	$comment['blog']       = get_option('home');

I am assuming that this is at most information one can gather. Whether you use a
Bayesian approach I don't know. How do you train your filters? Are you building
a neural network? Linear discriminant analysis? Support vector machines?
Boosting? All such choices can make a tremendous difference in the long-term,
especially if yet another service was to compete with yours. By changing your
filter some day 'along the way' you throw away what you already have. Stay away
from lock-ins (layering, abstractionand long testing phase are key points). To
get the least false positives [1], you need to make some important choices:

- The training algorithm
- The criteria (parameters) used in training, e.g. should you even care about
user-agent, or will it just add noise to our model? The spammer can easily
spoof these; not the case with IP addresses.
- Localisation or 'fragmentation' of filters, e.g. Chinese blogs will need
difference filters from these of an American. Mix the two and you will weaken
the model's specificity and generalisation ability.

[1] Spaminator, for example, can really puts off the user when it intercepts
(READ: not flags or re-directs) genuine contributions. False positive are a
popularity killer, especially due to the /volume/ of comment spam, where once
has to eye-scan.

Roy

PS - This time I proofread, so I hope there will be no typos as in my previous
message.

Subject: [spam-stopper] Potential Pitfall
Message-ID: <20050921071951.a261dyo6nb40wkc0@banana.catalyst2.com>

I forgot to mention in my previous message yet another issue that could arise.
You must be very careful who gets hold of the plug-in and probably impose a
difficult-to-fool registration mechanism. This is not a matter of getting paid
licences. There need to be a way of ensuring that illegitimate blogs do not
have access to spam-stopper.

A tool such as this in the hand of a spammer is dangerous. They may force you to
flush down your filters, starting from scratch again. Since you record blog URL,
you could probably weed out noise, but what if you have millions a la
Ping-o-matic?

Links exchanges and mass erection of blogs at Google's get-you-blog-in-5-minutes
schemes have shown the need for quality control. Spammer don't lack traffic.
Spammers don't mind destruction either. Give a spammer access to spam-stopper
and they will make their comments appear benign using brute force. Conversely,
let them make some mockup comments and report them as spam... solely in order
to break your filters and lead to false positives. In turn, as a direct
consequence, people may stop using spam-stopper, which has become overly
susceptible to spam. So, comments peculate yet again...

The bottom line is that one of the perils one faces is controlling the spam
reporters. You need to be provided with a statistical sample that is large
enough, but to have good 'quality control' at the same time. How can you then
handle zombies, dynamic IP addresses, etc? Will you need to authenticate with
those who report spam?

There are not questions to be discarded. Where there are gaps, there will be
exploits. Use word-matching spam mechanism and the spammers will use 1's and
4's to spell Viagra or use different encodings in HTML. Allow too lenient an
access to spam.automattic.com and the vulnerability will sooner or later be
spotted.

Roy

Okay, I have no idea what changed but $response seems to be an array now 
rather than a string. I'll test this on a few other servers and see 
what's up.

Also, someone tried to comment and this is what happend " It took the

I have a nifty little folder in my inbox that I've been saving the spam

No spam other than what I reported earlier. I know there won't be any
legit comments on the blog I am using the plugin on.

My laptop commited suicide yesterday. Luckily the drive was still
operable, thank goodness for Firewire Target Disk mode.

(PHP 3, PHP 4, PHP 5)
explode -- Split a string by string
Description
array explode ( string separator, string string [, int limit] )

Returns an array of strings, each of which is a substring of string
formed by splitting it on boundaries formed by the string separator.
If limit is set, the returned array will contain a maximum of limit
elements with the last element containing the rest of string.

---

An array will never be equal to 'true'. Try testing $response[1].

Under 10 spams today so far.  Matt, I do believe you are on to something
here!  Is this plugin one that will be able to adapt as the spammers adapt?

Matt, sorry for being the black-sheep here...  but within the last 6 hours I got 110
spams.
At least 100 would be stopped with the blacklist (usual words as mortgage/s poker, etc)

Regards
Mariano

That's what I did on my site last night and it started working again.

While I'm hesitant to push it out as a new update is that there seems to 
be something weird going on, the old way did work for a while, though I 
have no idea why.

If you've been getting a lot of spam change that line to $response[1] as 
Andy suggests above.

I made the change on my own site this morning and the plugin has
properly marked all spam since that time. To apply the change, open
the plugin file and change line 46

from:
		if ( 'true' == $response )

to:
		if ( 'true' == $response[1] )

and save the file. That is all.

I made this change earlier as well. I was getting spam all the way up until
that point and now there hasn't been a peep.
 Hizzah!

Here's something you can do for fun (or to test the plugin, if you're
going to be that way):

select comment_date, comment_approved, comment_author,
left(comment_content, 25) as comment_snippet from skeltoac_comments
order by comment_date desc limit 10;

I've been checking that every couple of hours and it's very nice to
see the results. :-)

I've gotten 25 spams today, so I will make the change.

It would be nice if somewhere we could get a basic report of how many
spams have been blocked, otherwise I can't tell if I just have no spam or
if all spam is being blocked. I won't be able to try until I get home
though. My laptop is in the iHospital.

Made the change as well. No spam has showed up yet. It's eerily quiet...I've
been getting tonnes of Chinese spam comments over the last while too, so I'm
hoping that this will stop them, as the comments have typically contained
dozens of links in simplified Chinese, so spam words are kinda hard to pick
out! :^)

I concur.  I made the same change (quite a feat for someone who doesn't 
know PHP) and the results have been tremendous!  I had to put in a 
comment on my own blog to be sure that the comments still worked!

This is what I like to hear. :)

I'm going to invite a few more people to the mailing list and send out a 
new version of the plugin later tonight, just FYI.

Matt,
I assume that you will make some adjustments and try it with another 
test group, and if their results are this phenomenal, the plugin will be 
released.  Will we get some notice of the release time so we can post on 
it?  I already have a title ready: "The Silence of the Spams"

lol

Subject: [spam-stopper] New plugin and welcome
Message-ID: <433257A0.10702@mullenweg.com>

First I want to welcome a few new people to the tester group, thanks for 
helping us out!

To recap the story thus far, we have a simple plugin that calls a web 
service that stops spam dead. (Or tries to.) When it misses something 
and you mark it as "spam" on the moderate screen it learns. The idea is 
that the longer you use it and the more people use it, the smarter and 
more effective it will be.

I've attached the latest version (0.4) of the plugin. The last version 
had an error that was causing it not to get results properly, so make 
sure to upgrade.

To install upload the plugin to your plugin directory and activate. 
Please deactivate *all* other spam plugins you may be running and delete 
everything from your moderation and blacklist lists (under Options > 
Discussion).

It's possible that a few spams might slip through at first, but it 
should get better and better.

I had 20+ spams overnight, but I didn't have the newest plugin, so that's
ok. Here's hoping this one stops the spam. I hate having to set them as
spam one by one.

Is the web service going to be open to other plugin developers or is the
service and the plugin going to be tightly coupled?

It's installed, and activated on boakes.org as
of 10 minutes ago.  No spam yet, but no comments
either...

The first thing I notice is that there's no
obvious feedback to indicate how much spam has
been killed. Something for the dashboard perhaps?

It's activated on Binary Bonsai as well.

How does it work? :)

I've had a few spam comments slip through, but they've been of those devious
ones that could very well be human typed...

Matt,
Yesterday before installing this version I've got 135 spams :s

Since the new install I received zero spam :)

It'd be depressing, right now the comments running through it are about 
98% spam!

Anyway I'll see if I can do this in a very lightweight way. I'm hesitant 
to add too much overhead because I want it to be as fast as humanly 
possible.

I haven't been planning on making the code of the server public simply 
because I don't want to give away the secret sauce to the spammers.

However anyone can run their own server that works with the plugin, they 
just have to duplicate the very simple API it uses.

I think that you answered my question, i wasn't very clear.

What I meant was, will it be allowable for other developers to make
plugins which makes use of the automattic server and API, since the calls
are in your plugin, you can't exactly keep them secret.

As far as the stats , go, what happens to the spams that are caught by the
plugin? Are they moderated as spam? If so, then really all that is needed
is a generic spam/ham plugin for WordPress that checks with the local
statistics. I don't think anyone wants to see global spam stats (ie
automattic has crushed 4.2 trillion spam comments since 9/23/05, although
you'd very quickly surpass those McDonald's signs ;)

So far I love what I see. I only received 1 spam last night as opposed to
hundreds.
 My only questions are: What happens if I mistakenly mark someone's comment
as spam. Is there a way to tell the system to unmark/unlearn them?

The way we're doing things it's highly unlikely to get false positives. 
All spam is still in your DB marked as spam, so you can recover it if 
you want.

During this testing period I'm watching every comment go by, there have 
been no false positives yet.

No no, heh.... haven't done that. But I know in the past I've looked over a
whole list of moderated comments and just clicked the check all as spam
button.... only to relialize later one was hiding in the masses of spam.

Hi



Spam-stopper really impressed me. I didn't receive spam since I activated
Spam-stopper. With most anti-spam tools it's very depressing if you are
using it with another language (some of the tools think Dutch looks a lot
like spam and put it in moderation, so I still have to go through the list
manually).

My website is in Dutch and I receive about 20-30 spam messages a day (quite
a lot for a personal blog). I haven't received spam since yesterday and
other posts show up normal.

Nice work!! :-)

So far in the 48 hours I've had it activated, I've had zero spam comments,
and one spam trackback.  Is it supposed to be filtering those as well?

Hi Matt.  I've been using your new spam-stopper plugin for the last
few days and it's worked great -- My question is should the plugin
mark the spam messages as spam and then disappear or should they show
up as comments that need moderation?  I am getting a lot of emails
about comments that need moderation.  Is that the correct behaviour? 
Thanks

I'm a bit confused as to what 'normal behavior' is as well...

Yes it's filtering trackbacks but those are more likely to slip past 
then comments. Mark it as spam and it'll learn!

They should be marked as spam and then disappear. There is a bug 
*somewhere* where even after being marked as spam they can end up in 
moderation anyway, not sure where in the flow it's getting lost.

Yo all,

Yesterday I had 100+ legitimate comments get marked as spam. I'm still
not 100% sure on the cause, but I think it might be due to this:
http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2005/09/25/k2-r90-users-listen-up/
(I'm looking into it).

Regardless, WP sincerly needs an interface for brining comments back
from the spam-grave. It took me way way too long to sift through my
SQL db (I have no 1337 SQL sk1llz, so I did it manually); and it was
easier for me to delete the comments in question than to mark them as
approved.

It wasn't so bad this time, as most of the comments were merely
testing the new ajax comments in K2, but I'd hate to see something
like it happen again.

I just went through the last 200 or so comments marked on my site and 
didn't see any false positives. I would definitely like to know what 
caused this.

It's very weird indeed. I haven't had time today to properly look it
over, but I'm also sort of working blindly here; I don't know what
could trigger something as being spam.

Currently it seems that my comments are the only ones being marked as
spam (?!?!?!), and I have _no_ clue what to do about it :(

Do you have any idea what I can do to make myself not be a spammer?
It's all pretty black arts for me.

I'm not sure what you mean by that. Are you saying comments you make are 
being marked as spam? If you mean the problem where EVERYTHING was 
marked as spam, I suspect that's related to something else because I'm 
sure everyone would have noticed something like that.

Can you make a comment now to test? I haven't seen anything come across 
the stream from you.

I just downloaded K2 r90 and I see *you've completely rewritten the 
comment script as part of the theme*. This is wrong on so many levels, 
and I'm afraid I can't support you as long as this continues.

Themes are for PRESENTATION, not for rewriting core functionality.

It's Chris' code, I have no idea what it does or does not do.

Regardless, I doubt that K2's comment code is the culprit in marking
me, the admin of the system, as a spammer.

Does ANYONE know where to start looking for a solution to this? Is
this all black magic? Why do anti-spam solutions always turn around
and bite me in the ass?

It replaces wp-comments-post.php. This also means k2's comments-ajax.php
will need to be updated every time WP is updated, for example the script
is significantly different than how comments work in 1.6 already.

There is a set API for plugins to modify the comment workflow, if you're 
going to modify functionality you should use that, not duplicate the file.

There have been three "testing" comments from eudaimic at binarybonsai.com, 
each returned false (not marked as spam).

I know this may be off topic, but I suggest you folks have a look at:

http://www.dvorak.org/blog/?p=2904

This Apache rule is said to be capable of blocking spam very effectively in
Dvorak's WordPress blog.

Matt, I tried spam-stopper in my WordPress 1.2.x installations, but the hooks
appear to neglect the plug-in. Spam just kept flooding in (more easily than
ever since other protections were down) and there was no notion of spam
flagging. I also set up a test-bed at http://www.schestowitz.com/Spam/ with
some inbound links. I suspect it does not attract any spammers though.

Sorry I may have neglected to mention it before, but the plugin requires 
version 1.5 or above.

I noticed those guys earlier, submit any you haven't already as spam but 
otherwise you should be protected now.

If you want to talk about how it's working for you, well or not, that's 
fine, but I'd rather you not share the plugin itself and the way which 
it works until things are more finalized.

I got 4 trackback spams last night. Marked them as spam, so they are  
there for review.

About the only interesting tidbit was one said something about  
banning poker spam or something like that, but it was in fact, poker  
spam.

The other 3 seemed like typical trackback spam.

Thanks for the reports everyone!

I've updated everything to better protect against this type of attack.

Remember to mark anything that gets through as "spam" so I can use all 
that data to better protect everyone.

For a few days there, nothing. Now it seems I'm getting one every 4 - 6 
hours come through. This is really no worse than I was getting with SK 
as my shield, but it makes me wonder if they're already working around 
whatever is protecting me with this plugin...

Plus, I noticed a larger number of real comments getting pushed into 
moderation rather than going right out. I'd only ever had one real 
comment go into moderation before, but I've had 4 or 5 real comments 
land there since running this plugin. It's not terribly annoying to me, 
since I don't get a high number of comments overall... but it's a rather 
large percentage if you look at that. I'd imagine a more popular site 
would find that frustrating. Or am I the only one seeing that?

Today I got my first spam since I've been using Spam Stopper.

I marked it as spam, but just to be sure, here it is:

How can I be sure no real comments get deleted by spam stopper? I don't
see a list of the comments/trackbacks that are processed. It would be nice
if there was a logfile with an undelete option.

Hey Mel

I've avoided commenting on the blogs I'm discovering through this trial. Had
to comment on Mel's blog, and good to see the word breast doesn't trigger a
spam hit ;)

There is probably something else in WP causing that, maybe limits on the 
number of links or having to approve untrusted commenters? The plugin 
just passes through whatever "comment status" came to it, it only 
changes it if it finds spam.

Oh my, About 50 TBs got through and maybe 3-4 comments that will all be 
marked as spam.  Is there a plugin that I haven't found that will let me 
mass edit as spam rather than just deleting them?

Sorry, the service was actually not checking comments for the past few

some "mark all as ____ " links at the bottom of the page.

I'm using 1.5.2 and all it gives is to delete the checked comments.  A 
delete all checked as spam would be helpful as well (wink, wink!)

You can mark the comments/trackbacks as spam, but it's still difficult.
You have to edit the comment. In the advanced options, check "spam" and
confirm.

My settings for comment moderation are the same as they've ever been 
(which is to say the default). I had only upgraded to 1.5.2 (from 1.5) 
about a week before we started testing this. Is there something else 
that comes with 1.5.2 that might be pushing these to moderation? (I 
don't have any other comment plugins active... so I know it's not a plugin.)

And Sarah's comment (thanks!) that included the word breast (you gotta 
love posts about boobies, right?) - while it didn't get marked for spam 
- did get sent to moderation.

I think I too have just discovered a couple of
messages that were incorrectly flagged as spam
by sifting the DB.

It's possible that I manually marked them as
spam in error, but I don't think I did.

So,
  (a) +1 for any pointers to a
      "browse my spam" feature.

...and in a similar vein...

  (b) Are there any plans to include an
      "oh bugger, that wasn't spam, please
      don't add it to the DB" button.

You should go to wp-admin/moderation.php. There is a listing of comments 
in moderation and a radio box under each. At the bottom of the page you 
can mark all as spam, delete, ignore, approve.

I got hit with 27 poker spams and 2 loan spams around 5 am last night.

I saw there was a typo, so presumably that is fixed now.

Based on Matt's comments, it would appear that I can use the moderate  
all comments feature without interfering with the spam smashing.

I have been using only two settings - moderate when two or more links
are included and moderate if no previously approved comments have been
made. So far I've had only two comments go to moderation that were
actually spam.

This is frikkin' awesome! Matt, I'm gonna give you a moose hug when
you do your Canada tour! :^P

Its good to see me around too....uh...wait :)

Yeah, this plugin works pretty well. I tested the similar Spam  
Service that Mark Ghoush I think put out and it was equally as good.

It is as effective as Spam Karma was, so that is cool. I like SK and  
this plugin, not sure where the advantage/disadvantages of each is.

Btw, Matt, what happens if the spam service is unreachable?
