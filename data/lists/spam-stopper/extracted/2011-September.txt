Subject: [spam-stopper] Nonces in the Akismet API
Message-ID: <CABaPp_jaD1-=yeZ0m-y6BxCk0RA9Nf+AmZXjZR6kHwVYoz=qQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey there -

As an anti-spam measure, I was looking into putting hidden field form
nonces into a Mediawiki extension for Akismet, but I could use some
clarification.  I thought that nonces were part of the Akismet API,
but now it looks like the local Wordpress installations process them.
So: does any related information touch your servers?  If so, I can't
find any documentation about API usage.

Thanks in advance -

-James

"Nonces" or "Form Tokens" are processed on the server side in relation to a
users session. They are not handled by Akismet (since there is no need to).

Server creates a nonce and places it in the form and the user session
User submits form back to the server
if the form nonce and the session nonce match then everything is good!

Subject: [spam-stopper] competition spammers
Message-ID: <4E71F576.8070107@phplist.com>


Quite some time ago, a client was having a competition on their site,
where you could win some plane tickets to New York (this is a UK site,
so a ticket to NY is nice :-). We noticed a surge in sign ups and I
analysed it to be a "competition spammer". I wrote it up here:
http://tincan.co.uk/659/news/competition-spammers.html

Then another client had the same issue a few months later. And now I
have the third client with the same problem. And I did a check and the
Akismet API doesn't return "spam". In fact, neither does mollom, stop
forum spam or honeypot.

Now, I guess it's a bit heavy to do a whois lookup on every email, but
do you see any way to start adding these domains to your database in a
scalable way?
