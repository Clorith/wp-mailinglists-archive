I kicked off a discussion over on the MediaWiki mailing list about spammers and spam fighting:
http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2013-May/041196.html

There's a full thread of discussion there, although some of it wont be relevant to blog spam, but my original point was... ?could we take the fight a bit closer to the doorsteps of the spammers? Could we attack back at distributors of tools like?'SENuke Xcr' and 'Ultimate Demon'?

you'd think that with the penguin updates this kind of spamming would go away since its all basically worthless now. i guess some people are still stuck in the past and able to sell these ?services? to unsuspecting customers :/

I'm all for taking the fight to their doorsteps, just not sure how you do that in a broad sense without breaking laws or doing ethically questionable things. i suppose one good place to start would be to find a better way to identify, report and offline the bot nets or the hacked servers themselves since a lot of the activity seems to be originating from those kinds of sources. One would have to believe that finding some way to cloud/crowd source that would be ideal (fight bots with bots;).

FYI i believe akismet has an API that can be used with various CMS systems including mediawiki maybe these links will help you in your specific situation:

http://akismet.com/development/
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AkismetKlik

i would not personally recommend any of the solutions that employ IP blocking mentioned in the thread you linked, that?s basically a game of whack-a-mole which can actually serve to ban legitimate users into the future every time you knock out a mole from visiting your site because a lot of the ip?s in question are either dynamic or would only ever hit a particular site once.

i was think of making a youtube video about how to report email spammers. i figure that could be popular with a large number ?regular? users and might have the added benefit of knocking out these same servers generating web spam if enough people started doing it.

that?s my 2 cents for what they are worth.
