Message-ID: <7.0.1.0.2.20061207155037.020adc50@verizon.net>

Last day or two I've been seeing some obvious spam getting through 
Akismet that were trapped by my number of links test. These comments 
are composed of nothing but links. Anyone else seeing the same?

Not all such comments get past Akismet. It does trap other similar 
posts which has me somewhat confused as to why some are getting 
through and not others.

BTW, this is in a guestbook application not wordpress. But the 
application has heretofore been working fine and no recent changes 
have been made to it.

Mine have been fine, but a couple of weeks back it was ugly.

New trick used today though, post a joke with a couple of links at the end.
Therefore the text looks like regular well formed sentences & the blog owner
might actually think it's legit. By marking as spam we increase the risk
that akisment (et al) will learn the wrong stuff and we'll get more false
positives!

That's nasty...downright bummer. If that trick gets widely adopted by 
the spammers my heretofore usually empty moderation queue will 
require constant attention.

So now the Akismet team has to compile and maintain a database of jokes? <grin>

Do you get lots of jokes legitimately posted to your comments?   
Assuming you don't, you shouldn't worry at all.  And if you do,  
Akismet ought to learn that the joke content isn't a good predictor  
of either spamminess or hamminess, and should end up using the rest  
of the content to decide.

No, of course not. What I was trying to convey is that if many 
spammers start using the joke trick and akismet is unable to catch 
them and unless all comments with any links are sent to the 
moderation queue, the spam joke comments will be valid comments until 
such time as my application's users review their new comments and spot them.

Personally, I've been spoiled...out of nearly 6,000 spam to date, 
I've had only a few false negatives. The spam jokes will increase 
that. I hate to see any spam on comments pages even if it is only for 
a few hours.

Richard,
dont worry about the joke-spam; in my blog i got over 250.000 spam comments
and on the last 2 or 3 months i?m getting a lot of joke-spam... and not a
single one passed; the only problem, now i have to read the akismet page to
see if one of those is a false positive.
regards
M

I?m suddenly getting a bunch of erros along the lines of:

 

  The remote name could not be resolved:
'{my-akismet-api-key}.rest.akismet.com'

 

I can resolve akismet.com but not rest.akismet.com or my full akismet url.

I see you also sent something on the contact form, but I'll reply here.

What you just described is a DNS error. You can try visiting that domain 
in your browser or pinging it.

I tried pinging it, and it didn't come up. Is Akismet having DNS problems?

Message-ID: <20061208165236.GQ23649@yukidoke.org>

I am not able to resolve rest.akismet.com while I am able to resolve all
of the subdomains. While most API class use an API-key subdomain, the
verify-key call should be able to be made with a subdomain. This breaks
Michael Foord Python implemenation very badly and might have similar
effects on others as well.

I've worked around this situation temporarily by putting one of the two
hosts (72.21.44.242 or 72.232.207.234) into my /etc/hosts file for
rest.akismet.com.

Of course, either the documentation (and the implemenations out there)
need to be changed or that domain needs to start resolving again.
Thanks!

Later,
Mako

I find it highly amusing that Akismet has its servers at Layered Tech, which
in those very same racks is hosting large numbers of high-volume blog
spammers. I find it highly disappointing that I've never been able to get
Layered Tech to do anything about those high-volume blog spammers.

Actually, I I think it it's probably both.

If urllib can't resolve a domain, it raises and exception which is not
caught by your code. That's not ideal. I'm not sure what people want to
happen when DNS isn't working but I'm pretty sure it's something other
than a 500 and a traceback in the logs.

It seems that the WP plugin just let spam through which, while ugly, may
be the more graceful method of failure. At the very least, it should
probably raise an Akismet error similar to what happens when a verify
fails key call fails. Then it falls on people that use your library to
decide how they want to treat those errors when they show up.

Later,
Mako

I've found them to be fairly responsive when sending logs of the 
problems. Often it's not their direct customers, but some shared host 
that gets servers from them.
