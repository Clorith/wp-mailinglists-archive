Hi guys,

I'm working on an Akismet binding in server-side JavaScript and so I was 
studying the document at http://akismet.com/development/api/ . I've had 
a few questions which I was hoping you could answer for me.

1) The Comment Check API complains that there was an "Empty 'key' 
value". The document above mentions no key value except in the domain.

2) The Comment Check call is documented to return "true" or "false" as 
the body content, but so far I've only gotten "valid" and "invalid". Is 
this expected, or am I doing something wrong?

3) The document says that if I'm having a hard time triggering I can use 
the author as "viagra-test-123" and it will always trigger true, but 
this still returns "valid", which I assume means "not spam". Again, am I 
doing something horribly wrong?

Thanks in advance for any hints!

Ethan

The answer seems to be that I had a problem with my HTTP library 
re-using connections in some horrible way. So, yes, I was doing 
something horribly wrong.
