Subject: [spam-stopper] Akelos PHP Framework Akismet plugin announcement
Message-ID: <D4736962-E961-4E3F-8E4E-5891F9678CF9@bermilabs.com>

Hi,

I just subscribed to this list and don't know if it is the right  
place for making announcements.

If I'm on the wrong place, please stop reading the message and accept  
my apologies :)

I've just coded an Akismet plugin for the Akelos PHP Framework http:// 
akelos.org (a Rails port to PHP).

The code can be found at:

     http://svn.akelos.org/plugins/akismet/

And the plugin documentation at:

     http://wiki.akelos.org/akismet

I added some simple unit tests before putting it into production.

Thank you very much for providing this great service for free!

Cheers,

Bermi Ferrer

Subject: [spam-stopper] Akismet API key for unit tests
Message-ID: <1208313368.780.2.camel@localhost>

Hello,

Is there a publicly available API key that can be used in automated unit
tests for implementations of the Akismet API? This is for the PEAR
package Services_Akismet at
http://pear.php.net/packages/Services_Akismet.

Thanks,


Mike

This key would be checked into public CVS and usable by anyone who
downloads the package and wants to run the tests. If a regular key is
fine for this purpose I'll do that.

Subject: [spam-stopper] New PHP5 Akismet CURL class
Message-ID: <abee97250804182055k79470caaqa831157ae1556c71@mail.gmail.com>

Well, after looking over a couple rather large akismet classes built on
fopen() - I made a new cURL version.
It is small and fast and will allow people to batch submit comments without
the need for several $objects or re-connects.

http://code.google.com/p/akismet-php-curl-class/

Note: It only works on PHP5 (which is everywhere!)

Could I get anyone to try it out? ;)

Subject: [spam-stopper] My testimonial
Message-ID: <2d764fd00804270311q39c91e3bre24384557763224c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Matt

I've got a testimonial on http://akismet.com/

It used to have a link to my blog back when it lived on a subdomain. When I
moved it to it's own space I put a redirect on.

Any chance of having the link reinstated?

was sarahk.pcpropertymanager.com
now www.itamer.com

The testimonial stands - I'm still stunned at how much spam I get and am
thrilled that I never have to manage it.

thanks

Sarah
