Subject: [spam-stopper] What to tell users who have been mistakenly flagged
	as spam by Akismet?
Message-ID: <ee3949160810160812g48d1eec7x77e6630f0eb932af@mail.gmail.com>

I've integrated Akismet into my Wordpress plugin tdo-mini-forms[1] and
I've found it works an absolute treat, thank you. Many of my users
have reported the same. However a small number of users have found
their submissions being flagged as spam [2][3]. Where can I point
them, to possible resolve the issue?

Thanks in advance
Mark

Akismet has a ham submission protocol; you could offer them a way to
submit something for reconsideration; do not fully automate ham
submission though, that would be bad.  Ideally, the plugin could
maintain some kind of moderation queue that would route possible ham
by the owner of the akismet key for a live
approve-and-report-ham/disapprove-and-don't-report-ham decision.

My plugin does have a moderation queue of submissions flagged as spam,
but I'm not sure about offering a "reconsideration" option - it'll
just be another avenue for spammers.

I think more the issue is, what do I tell someone who comes looking
for support from my plugin if their submissions are getting flagged as
spam? Do I just tell them to chill out and the system will correct
itself - that I've already flagged their submission to me as not spam?

the system doesn't take care of itself; it required corrective nudging
in the form of the ham submission. (which I trust works. I haven't had
anyone pass a ham to me for submission since I added akismet to the
tipar generic form handler, so I don't know from personal experience
if it really works, but I trust the documentation)

as long as it takes extra clicks, it will be an avenue for spammers to
annoy the site operator only.  You could captcha-protect the
"reconsider" option, or charge "tipjarium captcha points" to request a
reconsideration; contact me off-list to integrate my partial captcha
value disbursement system into your plug-in if you like.

(shameless plug: I'm developing a system for accounting captcha
completions, so if you have recently done one you don't have to do
another until you run out.  I expect this to revolutionize commerce.
I desperately need collaborators and testers.)

I imagine an ideal flow chart would go something like this:

     commentor submits comment

     akismet check

     akismet check indicates spam and jump to ACIS

     queue in moderation queue or post

     done

     ACIS:

    offer commentor non-free (requires captcha or equivalent) option
to request akismet override

    commentor accepts option including jumping through required hoop

   queue comment in "other" moderation queue
