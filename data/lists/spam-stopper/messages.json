The plugin supports detection\nof spam and giving feedback back to Akismet.com.\nThe latter is supported by the plugin, but Nucleus does not include a\nmoderation queue by default, so this won't be used on a normal\ninstallation of Nucleus.

    "body": "Matt wrote the Akismet plugin. Alex Potsides used the code to create \na php5 class. Bret Kuhns converted that to a php4 class. Then I came \nalong and, being a finicky kind of person, just couldn't leave well \nenough alone. :-)\nSome time ago I made some changes to the php4 class. I (and others) \nhave been using it in my application for a number of months. Summary \nof the changes:\n* Replaced trigger_error() on fsockopen failure with a return status \ncode. This allows your script to handle the error instead of having \nexecution halt and your visitor seeing an ugly PHP error message. \nDisabled PHP error display before the fsockopen to prevent the PHP \nerror message and re-enabled error display after the error is trapped.\n* Added 'no connect' as a possible isCommentSpam() and Akismet() return status.\n* Added isKeyValid() to check the status following the initial Akismet() call.\n* Revised and extended comments/documentation to provide more information\nSee the documentation and download it at:\nhttp://www.scripts.oldguy.us/akismet-class-doc.php\nRegards,\nRichard",

I've been using your new spam-stopper plugin for the last\nfew days and it's worked great -- My question is should the plugin\nmark the spam messages as spam and then disappear or should they show\nup as comments that need moderation?

Is that the correct behaviour? \nThanks\n--Vinny\nhttp://www.j2eegeek.com/blog/\nOn 9/22/05, Matt Mullenweg \u003cm at mullenweg.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e First I want to welcome a few new people to the tester group, thanks for\n\u003e helping us out!\n\u003e\n\u003e To recap the story thus far, we have a simple plugin that calls a web\n\u003e service that stops spam dead. (Or tries to.) When it misses something\n\u003e and you mark it as \"spam\" on the moderate screen it learns. The idea is\n\u003e that the longer you use it and the more people use it, the smarter and\n\u003e more effective it will be.\n\u003e\n\u003e I've attached the latest version (0.4) of the plugin. The last version\n\u003e had an error that was causing it not to get results properly, so make\n\u003e sure to upgrade.\n\u003e\n\u003e To install upload the plugin to your plugin directory and activate.\n\u003e Please deactivate *all* other spam plugins you may be running and delete\n\u003e everything from your moderation and blacklist lists (under Options \u003e\n\u003e Discussion).\n\u003e\n\u003e It's possible that a few spams might slip through at first, but it\n\u003e should get better and better.\n\u003e\n\u003e --\n\u003e Matt Mullenweg\n\u003e   http://photomatt.net | http://wordpress.org\n\u003e http://pingomatic.com | http://cnet.com\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e spam-stopper mailing list\n\u003e spam-stopper at lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/spam-stopper\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e",

What do you think?\nI think this would be a bad idea. This type of IP blocking is both\nover-broad and under-broad and the reason I Akismet is interesting to me\nis because it is content based as opposed to originator based.\nVery frequently, machines that spam are badware infected computers are\nbeing used by spammers as proxies. Often, those computers will be fixed\nlater.  Then there are dynamic IP ranges or shared IP blocks with NAT.\nIt's bad enough when your IP is flagged and you have to moderate a\ncomment before it's posted. In your system, people are never given that\noption chance.  There's no moderation queue or even an option for one.\nIf it works for you, that's great. But the price of the false positives\nfrom an IP-based addition to Akimset like the one that you suggest is\nfar too high for me to be comfortable with.\nI also have run into performance problems on Vservers. My solution was\nto buy server space from someone who did not overload their hosts.\nRegards,\nMako\n-- \nBenjamin Mako Hill\nmako at atdot.cc\nhttp://mako.cc/\nCreativity can be a social contribution, but only in so\nfar as society is free to use the results. --RMS\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 189 bytes\nDesc: Digital signature\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/spam-stopper/attachments/20070421/15b3f2ba/attachment.pgp\u003e",

Akismet alone works pretty well, but sometimes it flags \ncomments as spam which are cleary ham and the way around.\nIt can become a real problem if the amount of spam on your blog is very \nvery high ... I never look at the list of caught spam, because I would \nhave to oversee hundreds of comments each time. Thus real comments \nincorrectly flagged as spam might never see the light :-(\nAn relatively easy way to further enhance Akismet (if in the use without \nSpam Karma) would be to never ever flag (or even check) a comment as \nspam if it was written by a registered user! Another good thing would to \ncheck the new comment against old comments. How often does the \"new\" \nuser/mail/url combination exist in either collected spam (moderation \nqueue) or ham (all comments) and how recent are these appearances? This \ncould be uses to \"weight\" the comment. I do not want to see a single \ncomment of a regular commenter flagged as spam, no matter what he/she \nwrites or links to!\nThat's all for now ;-)",

However the list of\nkeywords can get very large and hard to maintain.\nI've made a mod for this mod to add akismet support.

This is not a matter of getting paid\nlicences. There need to be a way of ensuring that illegitimate blogs do not\nhave access to spam-stopper.\nA tool such as this in the hand of a spammer is dangerous. They may force you to\nflush down your filters, starting from scratch again. Since you record blog URL,\nyou could probably weed out noise, but what if you have millions a la\nPing-o-matic?\nLinks exchanges and mass erection of blogs at Google's get-you-blog-in-5-minutes\nschemes have shown the need for quality control. Spammer don't lack traffic.\nSpammers don't mind destruction either. Give a spammer access to spam-stopper\nand they will make their comments appear benign using brute force. Conversely,\nlet them make some mockup comments and report them as spam... solely in order\nto break your filters and lead to false positives. In turn, as a direct\nconsequence, people may stop using spam-stopper, which has become overly\nsusceptible to spam. So, comments peculate yet again...\nThe bottom line is that one of the perils one faces is controlling the spam\nreporters. You need to be provided with a statistical sample that is large\nenough, but to have good 'quality control' at the same time. How can you then\nhandle zombies, dynamic IP addresses, etc? Will you need to authenticate with\nthose who report spam?\nThere are not questions to be discarded. Where there are gaps, there will be\nexploits. Use word-matching spam mechanism and the spammers will use 1's and\n4's to spell Viagra or use different encodings in HTML.

This is volatile information because it will be removed by a cron\ntask based on expiration (defined by module options). However, this is\ninformation that we could perhaps use to checker before sending a request to\nAkismet, and ban if the IP of a new attempt to post a comment matches the IP\nof one of those items in the queue, or if the text of the comment matches\n(good when spambots use proxies), or if URLs (full or only the host) in the\ntext matches, etc.\nThat is, I'm thinking just about measures against spambots. Simple checks\nthat could be made against known spam that we may have for a short period of\ntime in the queue. I'm currently coding a new version of the module, I would\nlove to hear thoughts or suggestions about that. :-)\nCheers\nMarkus\n--- Original message follows: ---\nrich boakes rich at boakes.org\nThu Jun 8 21:19:48 GMT 2006\nDirk Haun wrote:\n\u003e rich boakes wrote:\n\u003e\u003e Basically when you the user deletes an IP\n\u003e\u003e address based offender from Akismet they have\n\u003e\u003e the option of banning that address from\n\u003e\u003e connecting in future.\n\u003e A similar approach: I've ported Bad Behavior for Geeklog and when\n\u003e Geeklog's spam filter detects spam, it can optionally report the\n\u003e spammer's IP address to Bad Behavior.

    "body": "Hello list,\nfirst I'd like to introduce myself. I am the average blogger \n(www.sebbi.de) from Germany and recent follower of the Spamkarma2 cult. \nAs of now this plugin has never let me down and kept blogging fun \ndespite all the spam I receive.\nWhen Matt announced Akismet on his blog I got very excited about the \nidea and had some privacy issues with it. Of course that is relatively \nstupid, because hey ... it's the internet and Google already knows about \nall the comments on my blog ... so what the heck ;-) (but I am still \nwondering why everything that is contained in the array \"$_SERVER\" has \nto be send to Akismet ... that is a lot more than \"just the comment\").\nWhatever ...\nSome bloggers are posting about their switch from Spamkarma to Akismet \nand which one would be better and blabla. I tested Akismet and found it \nto be not worthy to be my only protection, but I know it would \neventually learn from all the submissions and get better with time. On \nthe other side is Spamkarma which is pretty much perfect and can be \nextended to become even more perfect! So I wrote a Spamkarma2 Plugin \nwhich checks comments against Akismet.com and submits them to their \ndatabase if it's clearly spam or ham. That way Spamkarma improves and \nthe Akismet database should also improve ... without user interaction \nand immediatly.\nIt's currently beta, but works as advertised.\nGet it here: http://www.sebbi.de/files/sk2_akismet_plugin.zip\nUnzip it into \"wp-content/plugins/SK2/sk2_plugins\" and enter your \nWordpress Apikey into \"General Settings\"-\u003e\"Akismet Check\" in Spamkarma2. \nYou can tweak some other advanced settings too if you want (please tell \nme about what works best for you). There is currently no other \ndocumentation for this plugin plugin (a plugin of a plugin ... oh my \ngod!), but I don't it's needed. The concept is simple enough ;-)\nFeel free to test it and I'm happy about every feedback I can get. If \nnothing bad comes up (the plugin being a server killer or something), \nI'll release that code to the public this week.\n@Matt: the original wordpress-plugin caries no license information. So \nI'd like to know if it is ok to borrow some of the code from it, because \nI have done so. Is it ok?\nGreetings and happy halloween,\nSebastian Herp",

    "body": "spam\nHi Folks,\nFor me, Akismet was great at first because it \nidentified the spam, and (although rare) when \nthere were false positives, there was only 10:1 \nspam ratio so the real messages were really obvious.\nThe recent upsurge in comments (and thus the \nupsurge in Akismet's quarry) has had a \ndetrimental knock-on effect on the ease of \nseparating ham from spam.\nThe task of spotting a piece of false-positive \nham in the middle of hundreds of spams is no \ndifferent to what we were doing before, manually \nsifting through every message - the only change \nis that instead of looking for \"ham to accept\" \nwe now have to look for \"ham to de-spam\".\nTo improve this I added a \"Worst Offenders\" \nsection to the 1.15 version of Akismet.  It \nlists the IP addresses and domains that appear \nmost frequently, and allows the user to delete \nthese en-masse, reducing the amount of spam/ham \nfiltering to a far more manageable amount.\nIt's manageable on my site anyway, your mileage \nmay differ.\nThe updated plugin is here:\nhttp://boakes.org/download/akismet-1.15-wo.zip\nIt hopefully proves that such a system is fairly \nuseful, and might give people a few ideas for \nbetter solutions.\nThinking forward I was considering two avenues \nof development that might be useful:\n(1) combine the worst-offenders IP addresses \nwith the existing WP capability to write the \n.htaccess file, thus having a dynamic deny list \nthat targets active spam-bots.\n(2) to allow more experimentation, the Akismet \nsize of things could be made a bit more \npluggable with filters triggered when the spam \npage is submitted and displayed.  This could \nenable akismet plugin-lets to provide more \nintelligent management functions (like this one) \nwithout having to update the core plugin).\nAnyway; food for thought and a plugin to play \nwith.  Hope it's useful :)\nRich\n--\nhttp://boakes.org",

These are less likely to be removed. At worse  scenar-\nios,  they  confuse the Webmaster that will leave it in tact, thereby  en-\ncouraging more.\nUse of the page title is common, but someone whom I know runs a Perl-based\ncomment  form  and is aware of the same spamming trend. Some spammers  are\nscarping  random bits from the site, then stitching them together. If  you\ndon't  erase  these comments, you will get more, but filtering becomes  an\nissue.  Other spammers use cryptic link with poor anchor text. Even if you\nfollow before deleting, they win. Similar to referrer spam...\nRoy",

The Wordpress plugins' html form field has its size \nparameter equal to 12 and its maxlength parameter equal to 15.  Does \nthis mean that the minimum size is 12?\nAlso, I have a few questions about the ksd_auto_check_comment function \nin the Wordpress plugin.  For conveniences sake, here's the code:\n    global $auto_comment_approved, $ksd_api_host, $ksd_api_port;\n    $comment['user_ip']    = preg_replace( '/[^0-9., ]/', '', \n$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] );\n    $comment['user_agent'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];\n    $comment['referrer']   = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];\n    $comment['blog']       = get_option('home');\n    $ignore = array( 'HTTP_COOKIE' );\n    foreach ( $_SERVER as $key =\u003e $value )\n        if ( !in_array( $key, $ignore ) )\n            $comment[\"$key\"] = $value;\n    $query_string = '';\n    foreach ( $comment as $key =\u003e $data )\n        $query_string .= $key .

As such, why not \njust eliminate this redundancy and add HTTP_USER_AGENT to the $ignore \nlist?  The same goes for referrer / HTTP_REFERER and (maybe - see my \nnext question) user_ip / REMOTE_ADDR.\nFinally, under what conditions is $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] going to have \ncharacters other than 0-9 or .?

    "body": "I have looked at the code quite thoroughly, noticing that URL's of sites get\nrecorded. This introduces the interesting possibility of getting spam\nstatistics, as well as the possibility of tracking blogs. By all means, it is\nnot something that bothers me.\nI also notice that filter output is binary, i.e. accept or reject. A\nSpamassassim-like ranking mechanism is worth considering in the future (at the\ncost of complexity). Regardless:\nI am curious as to what happens at the back-end. Is it something which ought to\nremain undisclosed at present?\n\t$comment['user_ip']    = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];\n\t$comment['user_agent'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];\n\t$comment['referrer']   = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];\n\t$comment['blog']       = get_option('home');\nI am assuming that this is at most information one can gather. Whether you use a\nBayesian approach I don't know. How do you train your filters? Are you building\na neural network? Linear discriminant analysis? Support vector machines?\nBoosting? All such choices can make a tremendous difference in the long-term,\nespecially if yet another service was to compete with yours. By changing your\nfilter some day 'along the way' you throw away what you already have. Stay away\nfrom lock-ins (layering, abstractionand long testing phase are key points). To\nget the least false positives [1], you need to make some important choices:\n- The training algorithm\n- The criteria (parameters) used in training, e.g. should you even care about\nuser-agent, or will it just add noise to our model? The spammer can easily\nspoof these; not the case with IP addresses.\n- Localisation or 'fragmentation' of filters, e.g. Chinese blogs will need\ndifference filters from these of an American. Mix the two and you will weaken\nthe model's specificity and generalisation ability.\n[1] Spaminator, for example, can really puts off the user when it intercepts\n(READ: not flags or re-directs) genuine contributions. False positive are a\npopularity killer, especially due to the /volume/ of comment spam, where once\nhas to eye-scan.\nRoy\nPS - This time I proofread, so I hope there will be no typos as in my previous\nmessage.\n-- \nRoy S.

Problem is the link off the\nakismet site is dead, and it appears the author has closed his website,\nHas anyone a copy of this library. Im planning to modify the lib so if it\ncatches spammers, it returns a wonderful file I have thats a 1 gig gzipped\nstring of zeros (and a html header) zipped into 1 meg. My experiments show\nit'll kill every browser it encounters and probably most bots. If that\ndoesnt work Im prepared to code a teergrub module for apache (Starts to\nsend a header then falls asleep.

    "body": "Hi all!\nI was getting close to 0 spam in my site, but since I released Akismet\nmodule for Drupal I'm getting one or two, heh. Not a problem because Akismet\nis catching them all. However, most of this spam is sent from a single\nspambot, from where I've been learning a bit about their practices.\nSome facts and observations:\na) They seem to use a custom HTTP client, that supports cookies so it is\nable to keep the PHP session alive. This is a must when comment preview is\nrequired before being able to submit the comment.\nb) They send the spam from different IPs that may or may not be proxies.\nSome of them seem to be ordinary PCs (just guessing now, probably infected\nwith a trollan or something similar). I have also observed that they have\nbeen monitoring the attack by doing manual requests from behind a proxy.\nProbably because their automated engine was getting a few errors :P\nc) They use real e-mail addresses from a known free e-mail provider. I know\nthis because I'm using a module that checks the MX records to get the list\nof mail servers and connects to them to check if the e-mail is valid.\nd) They tend to fill in the homepage field of the comment with the URL of\nthe advertised site (or one of them).\ne) I have also observed that they reuse the same IPs and e-mail addresses to\ndeploy different attacks, even when these attacks are happen in different\ndays. It seems no one is reporting to the corresponding ISPs abuse of these\nresources ...hmm... or abuse report resolutions are taking a lot of time...\nSo I was thinking...\nThere is little we can do to break their clients. There are even programable\nHTTP clients that support javascript, so they can easily emmulate whatever a\nuser would be required to do.\nHowever, I wonder if there is something we could do to stop them use the\nsame IPs, e-mail addresses and advertised sites again and again. It might be\nhard, but we are a lot more than them.\nWould it be possible to join efforts to document procedures to report their\nactivities to the involved ISPs and/or e-mail providers. If we really could,\nI believe, they would have to spend a lot more money trying to renew those\nresources that we could eventually stop.\nAkismet is great, but maybe there is something more that we all could do?\nAny thoughts or experiences reporting spammers out there? What if we join\nefforts in this direction?\nCheers\nMarkus",

One would have to believe that finding some way to cloud/crowd source that would be ideal (fight bots with bots;).\nFYI i believe akismet has an API that can be used with various CMS systems including mediawiki maybe these links will help you in your specific situation:\nhttp://akismet.com/development/\nhttp://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AkismetKlik\ni would not personally recommend any of the solutions that employ IP blocking mentioned in the thread you linked, that?s basically a game of whack-a-mole which can actually serve to ban legitimate users into the future every time you knock out a mole from visiting your site because a lot of the ip?s in question are either dynamic or would only ever hit a particular site once.\ni was think of making a youtube video about how to report email spammers. i figure that could be popular with a large number ?regular? users and might have the added benefit of knocking out these same servers generating web spam if enough people started doing it.\nthat?s my 2 cents for what they are worth.\nOn May 25, 2013, at 11:31 AM, halz wrote:\n\u003e I kicked off a discussion over on the MediaWiki mailing list about spammers and spam fighting:\n\u003e http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2013-May/041196.html\n\u003e \n\u003e There's a full thread of discussion there, although some of it wont be relevant to blog spam, but my original point was...  could we take the fight a bit closer to the doorsteps of the spammers?

If it isn't\nspam, the content is published, if it is, then it is placed on to the\nmoderation queue. Moderators may opt-in to receive e-mail notifications for\nall content, just content needing approval or nothing at all. The module is\nfully customizable, almost everything is optional. It also keeps track of a\ncounter that you can use to show your visitors how many spam has been caught\nby Akismet in your site.\nI have also implemented a quite simple method to check for updates at\ncertain intervals, which is customizable from the settings panel. It can\nalso be disabled.\nFor a complete list of features, support resources and download, please\nvisit the project page for the \"Akismet module for Drupal\" at:\nhttp://www.phpmix.org/projects/drupal/4_7/akismet\nBests to all,\nMarkus",
