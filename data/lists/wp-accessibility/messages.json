The code of a\ncomment down to the first link is something like:\n\u003cdiv class=\"dashboard-comment-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003ch4 class=\"comment-meta\"\u003eFrom \u003ccite\nclass=\"comment-author\"\u003ePersonA\u003c/cite\u003e on \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eArticle\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003eThe comment\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"row-actions\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"approve\"\u003e\u003ca title=\"Approve this\ncomment\" class=\"...\" href=\"#\"\u003eApprove\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n[more links]\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nThe heading above the comments fulfills the 'link context', in the\nsame way as the W3C's example:\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/H80\nIt would probably help to make the actions use list markup (p becomes\nul, span becomes li), but that's probably an easier change, and more\nuseful than adding hidden text.\n(NB: Those links could really do with better onfocus indicators - try\nusing them with the keyboard-only and working out which link you're\non!)\nAnyway, sorry to jump straight in like that, it just caught my eye!\nThe accessibility of an app like Wordpress is quite a wide ranging\nchallenge, I guess it's best to pick areas and try and improve the\ncore coding? I would struggle to find time to do a proper review (as\nJoe Clark did a few years ago\n(http://joeclark.org/access/webaccess/WordPress-ATAG-evaluation.html).\nThe admin area and accessibility guidelines have moved on since then,\nso that probably isn't relevant anymore.\nKind regards,\n-Alastair\n--\nhttp://alastairc.ac/",

    "body": "Hi there. We've been talking about creating an admin skin (like the  \ncolor scheme option under profile) that would be easier to use for  \npeople with disabilities. Obviously we want the entire admin to be  \naccessible, but in some cases it's not specifically accessibility...  \nthings like small click targets *work* but are harder to hit for some  \npeople. We were thinking this admin skin would do things like show the  \naction links on edit.php persistently instead of on row hover, spell  \nout some things we currently use symbols to represent (like View Post  \ninstead of # for permalink access), make it higher contrast, use  \nbigger fonts, etc.\nInstead of just having a single person create this, it seemed like a  \ngood project to try and bring together some of our more accessibility- \nminded community members. I figure there's room for participation in  \nthis mini-project to: identify issues in the current admin design,  \nmock up the new alternate design, code the css, and test the heck out  \nof the new skin to be sure it does the job well (with a repeat of  \nprevious steps as needed). This list seemed like the right place to  \nstart. Would anyone here be interested in volunteering for this project?\nJane",

        "body": "Hi Rich. It's great that you're taking initiative with this following \nthe wpdevel discussion, but for anything that touches UI (link color, \nespecially) it really needs to be coordinated with existing UI stuff. I \nhave asked for volunteers before to do a separate admin theme that \npurely aimed at accessibility (much higher contrast, larger click \ntargets, etc) but didn't get much response. We're going to be doing a \nCSS color sweep/cleanup in 3.1, so if you're changing link colors now, \nit's likely your patch will get overwritten without malicious intention.\nAlso, I know it seems silly, but each change should really be it's on \npatch. Better to have a patch of only a line or two that has a single \nfunction, so that if something has to be reverted, all the other changes \ndon't get lost with it. Like in this example, if we needed to revert \nlink color changes b/c they weren't approved UI changes, but we didn't \nwant to lose newly-added labels or something, with it being one whole \npatch there would be an issue.\nAlso, if you were just going through and adding under-the-hood things \nfor screen readers, etc., that would be fine to do independently, but it \nappears you are actually changing design things--colors, \nmargins/padding, highlights--and these are not things that get changed \nlightly. The theme designer (since it is 2010 you're working on now) \nneeds to be involved. Chances are he'd be fine with it, but actual \nchanges to the UI need to run by him for design approval. I'll email him \nthe ticket number you have listed below so he can weigh in and approve \nor identify any reasons he had for doing it the way he did. When you get \nto the admin, I would suggest working on an accessibility-specific admin \ncolor scheme first (which we would add to the existing blue and gray) \nrather than trying to patch the existing color schemes directly, as we \ncan (and want to) approve a separate scheme fairly quickly, but changing \nthe base UI for 20 million+ users is more political and takes longer.\nIf you intend to make changes that are visible in the UI, like adding \nelements on the screen and changing colors, you really should join the \nUI group and work through it there, so that your work doesn't get \nrejected as being out of alignment with the existing UI conventions. The \nUI group blog is at http://make.wordpress.org/ui and there are weekly \nIRC meetings on Tuesdays at 2:30pm in irc.freenode.net #wordpress-ui.\nThanks,\nJane\nOn 9/5/10 8:53 AM, Rich Pedley wrote:\n\u003e This list is unused, we need to start using it!\n\u003e\n\u003e Now I've made a start with looking at the accessibility of Twenty Ten, \n\u003e starting with Links, well mainly.\n\u003e\n\u003e http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14782\n\u003e [quote]\n\u003e\n\u003e Starting off with changes to the CSS only.\n\u003e\n\u003e Links: colors amended where necessary. added underscores and/or color \n\u003e changes for active, hover and focus.\n\u003e\n\u003e Gallery image links: adjusted things to use margin to center the image \n\u003e rather than padding, to allow for adding highlighting on image links.\n\u003e\n\u003e Skip link: now appears above the #access menu when tabbing through the \n\u003e page.\n\u003e\n\u003e Grey text/links: was 888 this just failed the color contrast, so \n\u003e changed it to 777 throughout.\n\u003e\n\u003e Forms: added highlight for input text and textarea, for active and focus.\n\u003e [/quote]\n\u003e\n\u003e Feel free to add comments there.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e However I have an issue with the access (role: navigation) menu, which \n\u003e can't be fixed with CSS alone, and is not just an accessibility issue, \n\u003e but a usability issue.\n\u003e To test and replicate download and use the test data via\n\u003e http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test\n\u003e\n\u003e You'll notice that the last link in the navigation is 'Parent Page', \n\u003e hover over that, and then the 'Child page 1'.

    "body": "(cc'ed to 2 lists, please be careful when replying)\nAs some of you may know I've suggested some accessibility enhancements \nfor the Twenty Ten theme.\nencompassing trac ticket: #14782\nBut that side(ie mainly CSS changes) is virtually complete, aside from \ncorrecting/adapting things to fit in a little more smoothly.\nNext on the list would be for me to look at forms.\nHowever I think I need to check on how far this will go before effort \nis put in, as the changes would be vast.\nA lot of the forms are split into boxes, so I'll concentrate on that \nfor the moment. Each box is, generally, a collection of inputs within \nan all encompassing form. Ideally these should be in fieldset's, with \naccompanying legend's.\nAdditionally, text inside a form, not in labels or fieldsets, isn't \nreadable by 'all' screen readers when in _forms mode_.\nhttp://www.pws-ltd.com/sections/articles/2008/accessible_forms.html\nJAWS 10 may be addressing this issue, but it will be a long time \nbefore that is widely used, and it should not be the only screen \nreader considered to be in use.\nHowever correlating the necessary changes would involve a great deal \nof work and time. Actually making the changes would involve more work, \nand more time.\nSo I suppose the crux is, is accessibility a high priority? If it \nisn't I doubt that the core team can spare the man hours and any work \nthat I might do is likely to become obsolete very quickly if not \nimplemented sooner rather than later.\nI'm more than happy to put in the time and effort but would feel more \ncomfortable knowing that we are on the same page when it comes to \naccessibility. If not then I can put that effort elsewhere within \nWordPress.\nRich",

Forms are the toughest \naspect of web accessibility. They are very difficult for many kinds of \ndisabilities, and almost impossible for the visually impaired unless the \nform is erm.... well formed. Those fieldset and legend elements serve a \ncritically important purpose for many users. Forms are also difficult \nfor developers and designers. Developers end up with a heck of a lot \nmore little details to attend to. Designers sometimes dislike the \nappearance of correctly structured forms. CSS has helped resolve this to \nsome extent, but some designers still resist structural forms elements.\nSo, forms end up being a triple problem, for the users, for the \ndevelopers, and for the designers. It takes a concerted effort to make \nthem work well, look delightful, and be fully accessible.\nYes, it's a substantial challenge. The whole admin interface is one \nlarge set of forms.  On the other hand, having this interface be fully \naccessible could be a key differentiator for WordPress. No other \nblogging platform comes remotely close to being accessible and a fully \naccessible WP would both serve a wider audience and have strong boasting \nrights.\n-- \nBob Easton\nhttp://access-matters.com",
