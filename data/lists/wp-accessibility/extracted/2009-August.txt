This is/was a really good idea.

And now we have working mailing list admin again we now have the list  
created.

So please come and join the party.

First off, I wish to thank "the powers that be" for responding to my request
for this mailing list.
I believe that by discussing and proposing changes to improve WordPress
accessibility those of us with expertise in this area can make a significant
difference.

Let's see if we can gather together all reports of accessibility issues
and/or concerns, look at what needs to be done at the code level to correct
these, and get moving on bringing WordPress into ATAG and WCAG2.0
compliance.

I'm excited to see this underway!

Let's see, since I'm jumping in here completely unaware of previous reports,
I'll get the ball rolling by bringing up one of the most glaring issues that
I've encountered:
Repetetive/non-descriptive link anchors need to be more descriptive and
unique. This applies to comment 'reply' links, 'read more' links, etc. The
current preferred technique is to place excess text into a span and then use
css to make that span 1 pixel and place it outside of the viewable screen
area as describe here:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/C7
I'm uncertain as to how this would affect the 'reply' situation, should
WordPress Trac ticket #10550 ( http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10550 )
be resolved by changing the links to form inputs; but as it is now, this
particular case should be resolved by adding comment id #s into the hidden
spans, like <a>reply <span class="hide-me">to comment #</span></a> or
similar.
'Read more' can be supplemented by titles. Any other repetetive / unclear
anchors should also be similarly supplemented to comply with this guideline.
Thoughts?

The read more links can be easily adjusted by doing something like:
the_content('Read the rest of <em>'.the_title('','',false).'</em> &raquo;');

However, while the reply link text can be changed, you can't make it 
specific to the comment.  It seemed like a quick patch was in order, 
which I made and posted on trac 
(http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10569).  Please give it a look, 
test it, and comment on trac.

Aaron,
I took care of adding the id easily since I chose to override the entire
comment walker with my theme (as wp_list_comments already allows). Something
to consider instead of patching to include another filter. I think if the
goal is to make WordPress as a whole more accessible, the best choice would
be to just add in the id into the default comment walker class' generated
reply links.

I'd advise a little caution before jumping in and changing all of
them, the relevant accessibility advice on this is:
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms-refs
"The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone
or from the link text together with its programmatically determined
link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous
to users in general."

I.e. if the repetitive links are in an HTML structure that makes it
apparent what each one is related to, adding more description can
simply slow people down.

Jim Thatcher did a great explanation of this:
http://jimthatcher.com/news-061607.htm

For example, I don't think that the actions in the recent comments
area of the dashboard would benefit from extra text. The code of a
comment down to the first link is something like:
<div class="dashboard-comment-wrap">
<h4 class="comment-meta">From <cite
class="comment-author">PersonA</cite> on <a href="#">Article</a> </h4>
<blockquote>The comment</blockquote>
<p class="row-actions"><span class="approve"><a title="Approve this
comment" class="..." href="#">Approve</a></span>
[more links]
</p>
</div>

The heading above the comments fulfills the 'link context', in the
same way as the W3C's example:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/H80

It would probably help to make the actions use list markup (p becomes
ul, span becomes li), but that's probably an easier change, and more
useful than adding hidden text.

(NB: Those links could really do with better onfocus indicators - try
using them with the keyboard-only and working out which link you're
on!)

Anyway, sorry to jump straight in like that, it just caught my eye!

The accessibility of an app like Wordpress is quite a wide ranging
challenge, I guess it's best to pick areas and try and improve the
core coding? I would struggle to find time to do a proper review (as
Joe Clark did a few years ago
(http://joeclark.org/access/webaccess/WordPress-ATAG-evaluation.html).
The admin area and accessibility guidelines have moved on since then,
so that probably isn't relevant anymore.

Kind regards,

-Alastair

WordPress has moved on, and so has both the understanding of accessibility
and the guidelines themselves.

The three sets of guidelines we really need to focus on are:

ATAG (specifically the backend)  http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag;
WCAG 2 (both frontend and backend) http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag;
WAI-ARIA (again, applies to both frontend and backend)
http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria

Ironically, since Joe wrote that evaluation, WordPress has gone backwards in
some areas, despite making up a lot of ground in others.
It would be great to do a new evaluation against the current guidelines -
this could help provide focus for this group.
