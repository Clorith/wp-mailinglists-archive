Subject: [wp-accessibility] New menu system
Message-ID: <C1929AD1-41CC-41A1-99AC-D0E3729D6E59@automattic.com>

Hi everyone. You may have heard about the new menu system being added  
to WordPress 3.0, based on the WooThemes Custom Navigation. One big  
problem is that it's not really accessible. I've identified a couple  
of things that need to happen to address this, but it would be great  
if any experts wanted to take a look and ID any/everything we need to  
fix for accessibility. The menus are in trunk now, under Appearance,  
if anyone wants to take a look. Results can be posted to the trac  
ticket for menus: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11817
