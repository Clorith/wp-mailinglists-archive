This list is unused, we need to start using it!

Now I've made a start with looking at the accessibility of Twenty Ten, 
starting with Links, well mainly.

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14782
[quote]

Starting off with changes to the CSS only.

Links: colors amended where necessary. added underscores and/or color 
changes for active, hover and focus.

Gallery image links: adjusted things to use margin to center the image 
rather than padding, to allow for adding highlighting on image links.

Skip link: now appears above the #access menu when tabbing through the 
page.

Grey text/links: was 888 this just failed the color contrast, so 
changed it to 777 throughout.

Forms: added highlight for input text and textarea, for active and focus.
[/quote]

Feel free to add comments there.


However I have an issue with the access (role: navigation) menu, which 
can't be fixed with CSS alone, and is not just an accessibility issue, 
but a usability issue.
To test and replicate download and use the test data via
http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test

You'll notice that the last link in the navigation is 'Parent Page', 
hover over that, and then the 'Child page 1'. Unless you have a 
widescreen the 'Child page 2' cannot be seen.

Is there a javascript solution for this?


Additionally of course because some of these pages are _only_ 
accessible via the menu, there should be an alternative listing 
display on the main pages linked. However that may be outside the 
scope of what we can cover (other than _strongly_ suggesting a widget 
is available that can do this).

  Hi Rich. It's great that you're taking initiative with this following 
the wpdevel discussion, but for anything that touches UI (link color, 
especially) it really needs to be coordinated with existing UI stuff. I 
have asked for volunteers before to do a separate admin theme that 
purely aimed at accessibility (much higher contrast, larger click 
targets, etc) but didn't get much response. We're going to be doing a 
CSS color sweep/cleanup in 3.1, so if you're changing link colors now, 
it's likely your patch will get overwritten without malicious intention.

Also, I know it seems silly, but each change should really be it's on 
patch. Better to have a patch of only a line or two that has a single 
function, so that if something has to be reverted, all the other changes 
don't get lost with it. Like in this example, if we needed to revert 
link color changes b/c they weren't approved UI changes, but we didn't 
want to lose newly-added labels or something, with it being one whole 
patch there would be an issue.

Also, if you were just going through and adding under-the-hood things 
for screen readers, etc., that would be fine to do independently, but it 
appears you are actually changing design things--colors, 
margins/padding, highlights--and these are not things that get changed 
lightly. The theme designer (since it is 2010 you're working on now) 
needs to be involved. Chances are he'd be fine with it, but actual 
changes to the UI need to run by him for design approval. I'll email him 
the ticket number you have listed below so he can weigh in and approve 
or identify any reasons he had for doing it the way he did. When you get 
to the admin, I would suggest working on an accessibility-specific admin 
color scheme first (which we would add to the existing blue and gray) 
rather than trying to patch the existing color schemes directly, as we 
can (and want to) approve a separate scheme fairly quickly, but changing 
the base UI for 20 million+ users is more political and takes longer.

If you intend to make changes that are visible in the UI, like adding 
elements on the screen and changing colors, you really should join the 
UI group and work through it there, so that your work doesn't get 
rejected as being out of alignment with the existing UI conventions. The 
UI group blog is at http://make.wordpress.org/ui and there are weekly 
IRC meetings on Tuesdays at 2:30pm in irc.freenode.net #wordpress-ui.

Thanks,
Jane

Hi,

I'd be very interested in helping with admin accessibility, but does
it need to be a separate theme? Seems like a basic, accessible (even
mobile-friendly) admin area which is progressively enhanced would be a
better long-term goal.

Has any work started on this yet.

Well remember that so far I'm concentrating on the theme and front end 
output, as opposed to backend/admin. Idea being that it will help 
ensure a process is developed(for me!), and for me to see how well 
changes get accepted by others.

Up next would probably be forms or adding in skip links or 2.

Well I can split the current patch down into portions, though remember 
it is so far just changes to the CSS. You'll find that a lot of 
accessibility 'fixes' need changes elsewhere. So it's not always easy 
to split it down into smaller chunks. Having said that... I think the 
patch can be split into 3 or 4 smaller ones, at least I will try to. 
At least that way I can perhaps better add the reasoning for each change.

But...

if one patch is rejected, it may then have a knock on effect to 
others, so they would all have be interlinked by some method.

An example is the Gallery CSS changes I made. This was changing the 
padding because a 10px border on an image was giving me an ugly red 
10px border on the focus and hover states. So that change was 
necessary to accommodate image link highlighting.

ahh yeah understood, and thanks. if necessary I can work with him to 
improve accessibility without compromising his design.

Mind if I play Devil's Advocate here. A color scheme is only going to 
help a small portion of users. It would actually be far more important 
to ensure the markup is correct first. There are quite a few issues 
that would need to be addressed. (I'll skip the usual rant).

But a high contrast color scheme would be a good idea to start with, 
as there are less changes involved.

2:30pm? which timezone?

Are they purely for backend/admin or do they cover the default themes 
as well?

Subject: [wp-accessibility] Accessibility query
Message-ID: <4C875AA4.8000809@elfden.co.uk>

(cc'ed to 2 lists, please be careful when replying)

As some of you may know I've suggested some accessibility enhancements 
for the Twenty Ten theme.
encompassing trac ticket: #14782

But that side(ie mainly CSS changes) is virtually complete, aside from 
correcting/adapting things to fit in a little more smoothly.

Next on the list would be for me to look at forms.

However I think I need to check on how far this will go before effort 
is put in, as the changes would be vast.

A lot of the forms are split into boxes, so I'll concentrate on that 
for the moment. Each box is, generally, a collection of inputs within 
an all encompassing form. Ideally these should be in fieldset's, with 
accompanying legend's.

Additionally, text inside a form, not in labels or fieldsets, isn't 
readable by 'all' screen readers when in _forms mode_.
http://www.pws-ltd.com/sections/articles/2008/accessible_forms.html
JAWS 10 may be addressing this issue, but it will be a long time 
before that is widely used, and it should not be the only screen 
reader considered to be in use.

However correlating the necessary changes would involve a great deal 
of work and time. Actually making the changes would involve more work, 
and more time.

So I suppose the crux is, is accessibility a high priority? If it 
isn't I doubt that the core team can spare the man hours and any work 
that I might do is likely to become obsolete very quickly if not 
implemented sooner rather than later.

I'm more than happy to put in the time and effort but would feel more 
comfortable knowing that we are on the same page when it comes to 
accessibility. If not then I can put that effort elsewhere within 
WordPress.

  Commenting on Rich Pedley's query about whether to make the forms for 
the administrative interface accessible...

I am not an active WP developer, but as an Accessibility Consultant with 
over a dozen years experience with web accessibility,

I write to encourage the work that Rich proposes. Forms are the toughest 
aspect of web accessibility. They are very difficult for many kinds of 
disabilities, and almost impossible for the visually impaired unless the 
form is erm.... well formed. Those fieldset and legend elements serve a 
critically important purpose for many users. Forms are also difficult 
for developers and designers. Developers end up with a heck of a lot 
more little details to attend to. Designers sometimes dislike the 
appearance of correctly structured forms. CSS has helped resolve this to 
some extent, but some designers still resist structural forms elements.

So, forms end up being a triple problem, for the users, for the 
developers, and for the designers. It takes a concerted effort to make 
them work well, look delightful, and be fully accessible.

Yes, it's a substantial challenge. The whole admin interface is one 
large set of forms.  On the other hand, having this interface be fully 
accessible could be a key differentiator for WordPress. No other 
blogging platform comes remotely close to being accessible and a fully 
accessible WP would both serve a wider audience and have strong boasting 
rights.

    hi.
a blind computer user using the jaws for windows screen reader from http://www.freedomscientific.com
and wondering how to use word press.
and to rebuild my star trek site using cms.
now how to start this project and to rebuild.
had been using visual web developer express 2008 and sql server management studio.
and a blind programming friend from blindgeeks at yahoogroups.com but he has not got time to help with the project, that he started with me over 18 months ago.
and now stuck and got coders block.
so was thinking about using a cms.
so how to dtart.
any accessibility that will work with jaws.
got the wamp server 2.0.
thank you.
marvin.

Hi Marvin,

You might find the accessibility list more useful, you can join it via:
http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-accessibility

I know there is a least one partially sighted user on that list who 
should be able to answer some of your questions. (I think he uses Jaws).
