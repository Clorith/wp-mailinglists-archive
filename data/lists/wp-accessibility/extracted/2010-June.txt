Subject: [wp-accessibility] WordPress Admin -- Interaction with Jaws
Message-ID: <AANLkTilsn8l_C0c2l3XPiyuw9KbH7dx9P0w96UabNSEU@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I work at a university, where we're using WordPress (with multiple sites) to
help faculty support their courses. We have a single blind user, who relies
upon the Jaws screen reader to interact with his computer.

We are encountering two issues:

1) On the My Blogs page (my-sites.php in 3.0, or index.php?page=myblogs in
WPMU 2.9.2), it is impossible to distinguish between the "Visit" and
"Dashboard" links of his various sites, as they are not labeled, but are
instead informed by their placement on the page.

2) When editing a page (page.php?action=edit&post=XXX in 2.9.2), the modal
window/overlay created by clicking Add Media is not seen by Jaws, which
keeps its focus on the hidden bit of the page -- that bit covered by the
overlay.

What can I (or we) do to make the admin section a little more accessible?

Thanks,

JohnC

Thanks for your reply, Al. I'm not sure that I followed the first bit. At
which checkbox should I look?

I have provided direct login links to each blog (or, in the new terminology,
site) with which the user is working, but this method did not seem to work
for him, for whatever reason.

We use each blog/site in the WPMU/WP3.0 installation to support a course
taught by our faculty, so it's important that they are able to update the
material in a self-service manner whenever possible.

I have some experience with PHP and WP plugins, but have not contributed to
the project, and am not sure how to best suggest and offer fixes to
perceived problems.
