Subject: [wp-accessibility] status of efforts to improve WordPress
	Accessibility
Message-ID: <7.0.1.0.2.20110616034442.04c2c738@earthlink.net>

Hello:

I'm not sure whether this list is still active, but I thought I'd 
post this message to see whether it might stir discussion and 
generate interest.

I was very very pleased to see this post and the detailed and 
thoughtful comments it generated:

http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/

But we've heard little since then.

I thought others might either want to post additional comments and/or 
we might be provided with an update. My guess is that it would be 
ideal to post comments to the blog post, rather than to this list, so 
that all comments will be consolidated there.

I'm  not a programmer, so I cannot contribute code, however, I am 
most interested in improving access to WordPress, both in terms of 
the front-end output, as well as to the administrative back-end.

I look forward to seeing progress.

As some may know, the Drupal community has been making very 
impressive accessibility improvements, and it will be great to see 
WordPress make similar strides.

This kind of work is increasingly important, and the time is right, 
given the status of the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 
(ATAG) from the W3C.  For details, see:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-ATAG20-20110426/

Best,
Jennifer

Correct, this mailing list is phased out in favor of
http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/. Soon I'll have it turned off.

I really appreciate you wanting to help. We can use it, for sure. I'd also
love to hear what has come from the ATAG working group that we should be
paying attention to, in particular. The W3C has asked us to provide
feedback, but most of us don't have the time or knowledge to be able to do
that effectively.

Cheers!

This mailing list never gained traction. When the UI changes came in with WP
2.7 there were a lot of people who wanted to contribute towards making
WordPress more accessible. Most of the folk I knew who were willing to help
have now moved on. I asked, repeatedly, for this list to be created so we
all had a meeting point to discuss accessibility issues and agree on code
changes to add to trac. The intention was that we would submit patches to
fix issues that were identified.  Sadly, the mailing list took time to get
approved and people sort of drifted away.

There have been several offers of help through this list, some of which had
no replies. While I agree that this list might as well be closed I also feel
that something needs to be done to point people towards the accessibility
working group. Some of the people who need an accessible WordPress are
unable to use trac so without clear direction as to where they may
contribute their input will be lost.

There also, in my opinion, needs to be a closer relationship between the UI
group and the team creating the default themes. Each of these groups is
undertaking work that is making WordPress less accessible. Interaction
between the groups would lead to a better result. Accessibility isn't
something that can be tacked on, nor is it something that can be done as a
workaround after the UI and themes are developed. If these are designed with
accessibility in mind from the outset it will save everyone a lot of work
(assuming accessibility is a goal).

Hello:

While I understand that the list is being phased out, I thought 
perhaps I'd respond to a few points.

There may be members of the WG who have worked with WordPress.

I'll presume not and will do my best to bring this response and 
Lynn's to their attention, along with the thread on the site.


Further, givenn the many comments on the blog from accessibility 
experts with direct experience with WP and WCAG, I'm not sure it's 
necessary to delay action until there's been a detailed analysis 
against ATAG.  I'm hopeful that someone has taken those comments and 
will be putting them into Trac in ways that make sense to WP's different teams.

I can imagine it might be easy to be overwhelmed when input is 
solicited, but offering people specific guidance as to how best to 
provide input might help WP accessibility to gain the traction it 
needs to in order to reach its full potential  both for site 
administrators as well as for site visitors.

In my experience, the use of Trac should not be too much of a barrier 
for the kind of experts you need at this point, but what will 
continue to be an obstacle is a lack of awareness of how to 
contribute to the community effectively.

I did a quick Google search of ATAG and WP, and I can see that a 
number of evaluations have been done over the years. But they've been 
done in presentations, on people's blogs, etc., etc.  This kind of 
fragmentation of effort isn't serving the WordPress community.

I've been following this issue for quite a while, have an extensive 
collection of bookmarks, but have never found a centralized place 
within the WP working teams' framework where people's efforts are 
collected and parsed appropriately.

When the list is closed, can it be closed in such a way that the last 
post includes a link to a blog post on what the next steps should be?

I look forward to monitoring the blog, to contributing what I can, 
and to pointing other experts I know to the WordPress activities.

Best,
Jennifer

Completely forgot to check the To: field, so I'm sending this again. :(

I know this is probably not the proper place, but it would be easier to track this stuff web-wise if make.wordpress.org gets some better organization, visibility, etc. It would help if front of make.wordpress.org had links to those discussion oriented sub-sites.

Even better if make.wordpress.org could get some of the infrastructure that wpdevel.wordpress.com gets from being on the wordpress.com system. The email subscription options are very helpful to the time-starved. 

I know, I know, I could hunt out and pull some RSS feeds to keep informed, but it would help if those make.wordpress.org sites were actually listed somewhere at least slightly visible.

Both of those are on the near-term (within a week) roadmap.
