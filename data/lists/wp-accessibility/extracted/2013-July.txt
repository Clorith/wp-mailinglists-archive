Subject: [wp-accessibility] testing wordpress software for accessibility
Message-ID: <97969C90C9E846549485A41167B6A103@AQIL2010>

I wanted to learn and test the wordpress software for its accessibility. Is there a way I can test it locally on my own computer before buying any hosting space?

Secondly, if one creates a blog, is it possible to prevent spam comments without using a captia? Is there any other alternative and more accessible method of filtering out spammers?
