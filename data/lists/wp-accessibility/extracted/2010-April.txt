Subject: [wp-accessibility] Menus in 3.0
Message-ID: <51C7FE73-909C-4D1D-81BF-0D4A9859B832@automattic.com>

Hi everyone. We have a new custom menu system coming in version 3.0 of  
WordPress. The problem is that the code it was born from (WooThemes  
Custom Nav) doesn't have a no-JS version, which we obviously need for  
accessibility. The developer who's been working on the menu core  
patches doesn't have a lot of experience in this area, so while he's  
moved right along with the JS version, we really need someone who can  
help with the no-JS version. Would anyone on this list be willing to  
help out on this?
Jane

Hi Jane,

I'd be interested in helping with this. What do I need to get started
looking at it?

Chris
