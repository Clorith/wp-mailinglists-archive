(*Apologies as I know this is off-topic, but I thought these events
might be of interest to llist members. Certainly members of the
WordPress community who care about accessibility are encouraged to
participate.)

open. It will be held at the Microsoft New England Research and
Development Center in Cambridge MA on Saturday, September 17. Join

interest in technology, accessibility and users with disabilities.

you there.
