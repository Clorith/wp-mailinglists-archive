Not sure if this list is even active, but thought I'd give it a shot.

What can we do as developers to make the gallery more accessible? I'l
contribute any way that I can. I work with ADA compliance at my company.

There are also several little things that I think we can work on like read
more links which are not ada compliant because they contain generic text.
Currently, we add hidden text to the anchor in themes to bypass this such
as:
<a href="">Read More <span class="hidden">about cars</span></a>

I'm here. And I often wondered if this email list was active. I joined in order to learn how to make my websites using WordPress more accessible, or WordPress itself more accessible.

I'm also here.  I can't remember when I subscribed to this list, but I
believe this is the first time I've actually seen a post.  Good to know
it is somewhat active and looking forward to seeing more discussion
here.  WordPress needs to stay on top of accessibility!

Is this list managed by the Wordpress community or is it outside of the
community?  Does the community follow this list?

This list mostly has been replaced by the blog at 
http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility.

Thanks Jane,

I had no idea that blog existed and was hoping there was a forum for
discussing these issues.

Forgive me, but how does a blog replace a mailing list?  How would
individuals be able to start new topics and threads of discussion?

I had the impression the blog is rather for core team announcements than
for open discussions. Is that correct? I could at least not find a form to
ask a question.

There is also no accessibility forum on <http://wordpress.org/support/>.
