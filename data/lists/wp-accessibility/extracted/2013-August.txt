I wanted to ask if there is a screen reader accessible way to manage widgets? Activating them seems to require dragging and dropping in a particular location which isn't possible if one can't see. Is there something one can do by editting the sidebar.php file for instance? Or is this part of wordpress just not accessible?

You can activate accessibility mode by navigating to Screen Options
and enabling accessibility mode. This turns on links to add widgets to
specific sidebar regions.

Best,
