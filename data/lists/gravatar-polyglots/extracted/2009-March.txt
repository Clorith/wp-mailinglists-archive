Subject: [gravatar-polygots] Some comments about i18n of Gravatar
Message-ID: <9b6c20460903021423w160ab45aw1879221ce4f96279@mail.gmail.com>

I finished translation and it went live, so here are some things I saw and
that should be noted.

1) Non-gettexted strings

There are still strings that can't be translated since they aren't in pot
file. Whole image cropping page is in this, then there is pop-up on /emails
page for confirmation of e-mail and text "primary" on that page, button
"Add" on /emails/new page, link "Close This Window" on help pop-up on
/gravatars/new/webcam, on /site/check text "How your gravatar looks on sites
using the following ratings" and text below avatars. like "G or better", and
finally e-mail sent for confirming e-mail addresses. Also I see that flash
for taking pictures from web camera is on English but I don't know could
this be i18n, it's not something important, but if it can't you should note
that so that we don't translate name of flash buttons in help

2) Accept language headers

I expected that when I go to http://www.gravatar.com or
http://gravatar.comI get redirected based on my language preferences
sent by browser in headers
but instead all redirections go to en.gravatar.com

I don't know did you even planned this, but I think that redirection from
this two URLs should work based on language preferences, so if user's
language in header is one of existing languages in Gravatar it should be
redirected to that Gravatar's version, and if that language is not available
then to be redirected to default English version.

3) Fixed size

Sizes for some elements are fixed, so text that is longer then English one
is npt completely visible or it is splitted in two lines. Examples are
dropdown menus on top (fixed at 130 and 70 pixels) or text "file" near file
upload field on /gravatars/new/computer/ or button "Set Password" on page
/account/change-password.
If this can't be i18n, same as in flash case, it should be noted so that
translators be careful and put shorter strings.

4) gravatar or Gravatar

There is non-consistent use of this term in all English text. I can't know
when there is "gravatar" (without upper-case capital letter) is it meant on
avatar (image) or on name of service (Gravatar). This is small gramaticall
issue that is not so important but I still want to note it :)

This is everything for now.

ok Grav should now redirect based on your browsers accept-language 
request header... this, of course, assumes that you're on 
en.gravatar.com, that one of your preferred languages matches a gravatar 
translation, and that en doesnt occur before the first valid other 
language in the request header.  (prefix).gravatar.com always forces the 
translation unless (prefix) is "en" which is how this all gets kicked 
off.  so...

en.gravatar.com/emails (accept-language: sv,en) will redirect to 
http://sv.gravatar.com/emails and display swedish

en.gravatar.com/emails (accept-language: blah,sv,en) will redirect to 
http://sv.gravatar.com/emails and display swedish

en.gravatar.com/emails (accept-language: en,sv) will not redirect and 
display english

sv.gravatar.com/emails (accept-language: en) will not redirect and 
display swedish

sv.gravatar.com/emails (accept-language: fr,en) will not redirect, and 
display swedish

If I messed up somewhere on this, please let me know. I'm doing my best 
to learn fast here :) I will address the other concerns as time permits

Cheers!

Hi,

I have to translate 58 strings yet (for the italian translation), but  
I do not understand the context of the phrases "your secret" "get a  
new secret", etc..

Thanks.

Ahh those relate to API features which are not yet generally available, 
a shared secret.

For the italian translation...

who's that translate gravatar in italian? the translation is full of  
errors...
if you want to make a seriuos project without the usual conflicts is a  
good idea...


italian version:

chi e' che traduce gravatar in italiano? la traduzione e' piena di  
errori... e rimandarla semplicemente per avere la propria "firma" sul  
progetto e' alquanto squallido...

se si vuole fare una cosa seria senza i soliti conflitti e' bene  
mettersi d'accordo, io non sono un bambino e non ho tempo da perdere e  
nemmeno smania di "potere"...

grazie per l'attenzione.

if you want to make a seriuos project without the usual conflicts is a  
good idea...


italian version:

chi e' che traduce gravatar in italiano? la traduzione e' piena di  
errori... e rimandarla semplicemente per avere la propria "firma" sul  
progetto e' alquanto squallido...

se si vuole fare una cosa seria senza i soliti conflitti e' bene  
mettersi d'accordo, io non sono un bambino e non ho tempo da perdere e  
nemmeno smania di "potere"...

grazie per l'attenzione.

Hello,

I cannot read, speak, or understand Italian, and there are two people 
who are interested in translating the site into Italian.  I cannot be 
the judge between the two, so if everyone can talk it through on the 
mailing list and come up with the one collaborative Italian translation 
to rule them all I would sure appreciate it. 

Cheers!
DK

First of all we always do serious project as we proven for years of WP
translation and support, we do not have to prove nothing to anybody
and we do not accept this form of controversy!.

The first draf is normal that is not perfect but it's purpose is to
test the space taken up by trnaslation and for correction, actually
it's not still an official public site and trnsaltion is getting
better every day. Wanna collaborate, vanna make typos corrections? I
can send you the actual .po for making some corrections and you can
send it back to me. Or u can list here or by email a the typos or
problem (usually elements that are small for the translated text they
have to contain). Second solution it's better cause alloow us still
edit the file without waiting for a merge file etc.

Next time you post a multilanguage post... please do it complety
avoiding it anor fully translate the italian part in english, and not
leaving the italian part with some controversy sentences that you know
other can't understand, thanks! It's not serious, neither polite for
other readers!

PS: This morning was sent a po/mo fully revised for typos with the
20/25 typos or so corrected...
