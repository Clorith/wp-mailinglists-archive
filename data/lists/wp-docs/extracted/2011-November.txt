I think this deserves an addition to the Codex guidelines for future
reference, don't you?

I think it's just a question of 'Where' at this point ;)

On http://codex.wordpress.org/Network_Admin under settings we have

"The Network Admin Settings Screen is where a network admin sets and 
changes settings for the network as a whole. The first site is the main 
site in the network and network settings are pulled from that original 
site?s options."

Subject: [wp-docs] Brief introduction for Michael Beckwith.
Message-ID: <4EB854DC.7040106@gmail.com>

Hi everyone!

I'm not sure how customary it is for new WP Documentation members to do
an intro email, but I figured it never hurts. My name is Michael
Beckwith, I have been using WordPress for probably 3 years now,
professionally for at least 2 of those years. I am a freelance front-end
web developer with focus on WordPress theme development. I also dabble
with plugin development but only on a personal level at this point.

I have wanted to contribute back to the WordPress community for awhile
now, but am not confident enough in my back-end PHP skills enough to do
primarily core patches/development. I realized that, with my constant
learning about WordPress as well as my frequent time spent in the IRC
support channel, the Documentation team would be a wonderful fit for
where I could contribute. I will likely stick to more of the development
area of the Codex, and not the beginning user areas.

If you want to get in contact with me directly, twitter or IRC are
probably the best methods. You can find me there at @tw2113 or in
#wordpress, #wordpress-dev and #wordpress-social on IRC.

Hopefully I can start helping out and keep the documentation top-notch.

I do believe "tw2113" as well. I use that ID pretty extensively. I know
I've interacted with you over twitter, even today. Think Hitchhiker's
Guide jokes. :)

Are links to commercial solutions allowed in the Codex at all?

The instance that got me thinking of this was links to ManageWP in several
pages related to Multisite. For example:

This was brought up a while ago [1] with regard to links to commercial
training resources [2].

Quote from Lorelle [3]:

"In general, we link to individual articles on sites that might be
considered commercial by the strictest sense as they host advertising
or sponsored content. Individual articles may be acceptable if they
meet our case by case requirements for "quality," integrity and
durability, as well as appropriate helpfulness. But we don't link to
entire sites, not allow one site to have a majority of links in the
Codex."

Just to clarify as that was taken a bit out of context, links to commercial
sites for the purpose of commercial link juice, credit, sales, marketing,
etc, anything that could be seen as an endorsement for them or by WordPress
is prohibited.

A fantastic article that helps spell out the details of the Codex article
on a site that isn't selling "commercial content" other than hosting
advertising and such (normal stuff) more than producing free, "open
source," shared content is allowed as it is considered external reference
material. These are set usually in the "More Resources" section not within
the Codex article.

Personally, I have REALLY high standards for including those as they have
to be "timeless" in quality. I want that article to still have value 3
years from now and not turn into a dead link we have to check and clean up.

Anything fish, spammy, scammy, or violating the WordPress Trademark are not
allowed, such as sites with WordPress in their domain name.

I like to think about it from my own site perspective. I like running a
"class act" and if I wouldn't put it on my site, why would I want it on the
Codex. :D

Welcome! It is the right way.

So have you thought of where you want to start and where you really want to
focus? We have a lot of new fun things coming up in the next release of
WordPress that needs updating and added to the Codex. There are a lot of
pages that need checking and editing, and a lot of links in the resource
section of many pages that need checking for dead links and possibly
updated articles to replace them.

If you tell us which direction you really want to concentrate on, we can
get more specific.

We're a quiet but purposeful group, focusing on keeping the Codex updated
and clean, with some of of exceptionally passionate about helping WordPress
users get the answers to the questions they need, and others poking at it
from time to time as their time permits. It's a diverse group and we love
new people and energy as it kicks our asses into higher gear.

So ask away and welcome!

Lorelle

Re-send because I forgot to click "reply all". It's been awhile since I did
a mailing list;

Thanks Lorelle and others.

So far, I've been looking at the "stubs" and "ContentEdit" marked pages and
looking at how I could expand and or clarify, as well as some minor fixes.
Areas that I want to focus on are Theme and Plugin development areas of the
Codex. Those are the areas I use most and will have the most knowledge in,
as well as have the most to gain in expanding on as I would be learning for
my own uses as well. The best way to know how things work are through your
own experience with them.

That sums it up nicely.

Michael has given you good starting point, but if you could let us know
what you are interested in specifically, we can direct you to areas of
documentation that would need your special touch.

Message-ID: <CAB+4OopQcnFH9xXRRFYbFYvu9SGZQt+9gE__XRBzajd5296xtA@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering if it were feasible to link to the specific line where a
function is declared when saying "foo function is located in
wp-includes/bar.php". Instead of just linking to
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.2.1/wp-includes/bar.php, go
to the actual destination, and then copy/paste in the link + line number.

For example from get_userdata():

Current source link =
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.2.1/wp-includes/pluggable.php
Proposed source link =
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.2.1/wp-includes/pluggable.php#L94

The #L94 anchor pulls them straight to the start of the comment block for
the function.

Thoughts? Issues that I wasn't around for the first time someone thought
this up?

As long as you use tags/X.Y.Z instead of trunk, there's no issue.

The only drawback is that it takes an extra effort to add the line number
to the URL.

The one issue that comes to mind is the line number changes, and as the codex is already a moving target, I'm not sure how much we want to add that over head....

Subject: [wp-docs] Simple How To for Functions.php
Message-ID: <DF7E2E6F-6762-4B02-90BD-ECAA2BCC978C@hearingvoices.com>

dear WP Docs:
at behest of the WP Codex Things To Do List,
a few months ago, i wrote  a "Simple How To for Functions.php":
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Hearvox/The_Functions_File

i asked this maillist for input, and got perceptive edits.

i included this at bottom of page: [[Category:New_page_created]]
and it appears in this list:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Category:New_page_created

but have never heard a word from Codex Documentation Team.
is there another step to bring this to their attn?

perhaps they're running behind, or perhaps the page is not useful.
but thought i'd inform this list one more time,
in case the contribution is still needed,
bg

It doesn't, if you link to a tag, as already mentioned.

You have got to be trolling me.

For the last time: Any file stored in any tags folder *will not change*.
Ever.

So:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.2.1/wp-includes/pluggable.php#L94

will *always* point to the same code.

I think that the *default* source link should be to trunk (or *latest tag*,
if that can be automated via generic filename link by the Codex);
otherwise, this practice would create a TON of links that have to be
updated with *every* WordPress major and point-release - and not just a tag
filepath update, but also a verification that the linenumber itself hasn't
changed.

Also, you'd need to consider whether to link to the line that starts the
function docblock, or to the line that starts the actual function
definition (I'd prefer the latter, though consistency is more important
than shed color on this point).

Personally, I think time and effort would be far better spent ensuring that
all function reference pages actually *have* source links to begin with.

Everyone that mentioned the fact that the source files change and that the
start of where each function is in the file are reason enough for me to
disregard this idea. That part is something that I completely didn't think
of. Was a noble idea, but WAY too much work with an ever evolving code-base.

Subject: [wp-docs] Should we link to Plugins and Themes not in the Directory?
Message-ID: <CAN2v4ZTyX58Gg=LOHs_a=r2JzSxVxAoKn1TZXqeE5AnnqWFTnw@mail.gmail.com>

I've posted a to do update in our Facebook page:
http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150366546107239&set=o.162707970456457&type=1Best
I got until we get an official site going. :D

A question came up with a volunteer about our policy of linking to
WordPress Plugins and Themes. If they are NOT in the WordPress Extend
directories, should we include them and link to them in the Codex?

Personally, and it's just personal as there really hasn't been a clear
policy, I link to only those in the directories. I've too many years
experience linking to Plugins and Themes on the author's pages and having
them disappear, change their information, not have the current information
nor links to the current information, etc. So I've just made it a personal
policy.

Maybe it's time to make it an official policy?

Okay, I've updated the Codex entry with a simplified version of the
Template Hierarchy diagram:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy#Visual_Overview

I've retained the link someone added to the "advanced" version on my site.
Let me know if this needs to change. (e.g. I'd be happy to upload the
"advanced" version, too; just let me know the best practice here.)

Also, I screwed up my initial upload, by uploading a new file, instead of
replacing the existing file. How do I delete this one?
http://codex.wordpress.org/File:WordPressTemplateHierarchy.Codex.2011.11.11.png

Is there a "delete" link I'm missing somewhere?

Thanks,

Chip

The article is great, and wonderfully helpful! Just what we needed.

just a couple notes that I thought I sent a while ago, but it appears not
to have made it through to the docs mailing list. Consider these a reminder
for everyone.

1. WordPress has a capital P in the middle not lowercase.

2. Plugin is Plugin not plugin or plug-in.

3. Watch consistency. In the first lists you describe the Plugins directory
as a directory and the Themes directory as a subdirectory. That implies
they are two different things, which can add to confusion. Little things
like this can throw someone off. Just be careful.

4. Avoid one word links. For example in a sentence with "Use WordPress
Hooks..." Hooks was in a link and WordPress Hooks should have been the
link. We do this for accessibility as well as clarity. Tiny words are
harder to click, and in this case, WordPress Hooks is a search term (unless
they are looking for Captain. :D ). The sentence continues with single word
links to actions and filters, which I've pretty much left because I can't
seem to edit it without changing the context or being redundant, so this is
always a challenge. Be judicial and try to keep them to a minimum of two
words.

I've fixed these and tightened it up a little for passive voice but the
core is excellent! These are just reminder nitpicks. This is fabulous.
Thank you so much!

Ouch, somehow I missed this in my email box. Part of the joy of traveling,
it takes too long to catch up.

The template hierarchy graphic has been hot linked to and used on a LOT of
external sites. Is the original still there on the Codex or was it deleted?
I'm still trying to follow the conversation. If it was deleted, we need to
put it back but we can remove it from the article. It would be nice to put
a note on the graphic that it was updated with a link to the page.

The new graphic is excellent. Well done! Thanks for the fantastic update.

I edited the example section to break the huge paragraphs into ordered
lists to help improve readability.

Do we really need the changelog? Can that go on the page's discussion? Is
it important to leave there? I'm seeing changelogs popup around the Codex
and I don't remember that discussion. Did I miss that one, too?

Thanks!!!!

The previous iteration is still there:
http://codex.wordpress.org/images/archive/1/18/20111111152755%21Template_Hierarchy.png

But, should we really be concerned about enabling hotlinking? Isn't that
generally considered bad form?

Hotlinking is indeed bad form but this is the Codex. People think they can
get away with all kinds of things.

So what should have happened is the graphic be labeled
template-hierarchy-v2 or something. Maybe? Or their hotlinks will update to
the new graphic? Now I'm rethinking all of this. Could be a good thing?

I know we can check internal referral links but do we have any analytics on
external links to the Codex? Matt is an analytics junkie, so I'm sure there
is (and I'd love to see numbers)...I'm off track.

Whatcha think?

All images in a file update like that remain there. It's a replacement
on the wiki side of things, not of the files.

Look here to see all previous revisions of the file:

Great. Just as long as we don't get screams from people for screwing up
their content. :D Though it should serve as a warning to those who hotlink
freely...<evil laughter>.

I understand why the P in WordPress is always capitalised, but what's the
reason for capping the P in Plugin? Surely 'plugin' is a genericised term.

The P in Plugin and usually the T in Theme are capitalized as a standard as
they are considered proper names. The decision was made in 2004 and it's
stayed there. We let it slip once in a while, but it is part of our naming
conventions such as P in Pages must be capitalized when talking about
WordPress Pages but lower case when talking about web pages and post is
never capitalized unless it is the first word in a sentence. I fought
those, but here we are today with those conventions. It also helps to
distinguish our Plugins from their plugins or plug-ins.

Eye balls not working, nor is search. Isn't there a Codex article on how to
submit your Theme to the Theme directory? There is one for Plugins. I'm
sure we have one for Themes, listing dos, don'ts, what fors, and whys.

Hi

I'm fairly certain that this has come up before, looks like "juego" is 
back adding signature links to various transalations on WordPress in 
Your Language.  This page by nature I guess needs to be available to 
edit, so protecting it is probably too much to do just now, but just a 
heads-up for folk to be aware of this.  He sent me feedback (over my 
webpage, to which I have not responded) and doesn't appear to believe 
that he's doing anything wrong with these spam links, so we can expect 
more - already he has at least 3 different accounts which have been used 
to add links in.

Message-ID: <8EB7961D-1A16-4F5E-917A-59D77D390356@hearingvoices.com>


does the Codex Doc Team have an opinion on: serial commas?
that last comma in a list before the "and":
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma

i.e.: I had lunch with my parents, President Obama and Queen Victoria.
vs.: I had lunch with my parents, President Obama, and Queen Victoria.

the latter makes it clear BHO & QE2 are not my parents.
so should we use serial comma when clarity demands,
but otherwise leave it up to author? or is there a Codex convention  
for its use?

thanks,

Definitely http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review is the place to start.
See also:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test

If there's any needed information (even a link to the "how to submit"
page), let me know, and we'll make sure it gets added. If we need to *add*
a "how to submit" page, let me know what page slug you want to use, and
I'll draft something up.

I knew about those. I wrote the first ones. :D A step by step how to submit
is a perfect addition and what I was really looking for.

How to Submit Your WordPress Theme to the Theme Directory or something like
that.

Links to subversion, examples of the Plugin method, etc. Step by step for
all the idiots out there.

Add a note about submitting to non-official WordPress spots as in "don't do
it" or some safety tips. Does WordPress officially recognize any site
submission spot outside of the WordPress Theme Directory?

In the resources, maybe add a few links to external sources on how to
publicize your Theme as that's not exactly relative to the Codex but might
be helpful if we can keep them to the right places and not flailing.

Thanks!!!!

Lorelle

Fortunately, I have most of that already composed, since I presented on the
topic at WordCampSTL:
http://www.slideshare.net/chipbennett/word-campstl-submittingathemetothethemerepository

I'll take a look at the analogous Plugin-Submission Codex page, and draft
something up accordingly for Themes.

Hmm, and even today there were more spam edits.

I set the page to block "new users", though I'm unsure if that has any 
tangible benefit.

That's not a page to lock down. We just have to ride the wave until they
get bored. Dang them. Thanks for riding it for us.

I love it when I make your volunteer contribution efforts to the Codex
easier. :D

I agree, though history suggests we tried it before for a bit. (Whether

Subject: [wp-docs] Link Spawning Search Results
Message-ID: <CAN2v4ZQmwMd1uc3oyR1t6F=b1HCArUTDCkK5MiEqrAVau2rmYw@mail.gmail.com>

I have two complains about search results on the Codex.

We suddenly have link spawning (opening links in new tabs and windows) in
search results on the Codex. I thought the search results page was broken.
I kept clicking links and nothing happening. Then I found 8 pages open at
the end of my tab queue. NOT COOL. Let's kill this as soon as possible.
Breaks web standards and causes more work.

The other thing is that the search box when in the Codex area says "Search
Codex" yet it returns search results from everything. We've talked about
this before. It causes problems as it doesn't seem to prioritize Codex
content and often brings up unhelpful support discussions and WordPress
Plugins when all I need is to look something up.

Is there any way to prioritize the Codex information when searching in the
Codex or separating out the rest of the stuff below and the Codex results
up top?

Thanks for letting me kvetch. :D

I am going to +1 the no "open new tab/window" for the search results page.
I have configured my browsers search bar hot keys to work with the search
page("wp moving wordpress" for example brings up the "moving wordpress"
search results), and it's annoying having to close the extra tab.

Yes, please (on the latter issue).

I don't actually use the WPORG search form. If I need to search the Codex,
I use google with "site:codex.wordpress.org" - and I suspect I'm not alone.
It would be awesome for the site search capability to get some love.

Okay, team, let's kick some Codex butt.

First up: http://codex.wordpress.org/Site_Design_and_Layout

I had no idea it was THAT far out of date. I want to remove all the crap
linking to WordPress lesson basics, content stuff and all that. Most of it
needs to go into Getting Started such as smilies and images.

This TOC needs to be about Themes, everything we got on Themes. Anyone want
to take it on or do you want me to start a list and invite you to start
adding links and helping me structure it?

I just redid WordPress Lessons and this one is next.

Thanks!

I like the Special:Search page to search the codex.

All that is because of the switch from the yahoo search to google's :/

Can it be changed for the codex? Depends on how that was coded into the skin template for the wiki. It SHOULD be possible to switch the codex search back to the ... codex search and not the default WP one. That said, that it was flipped so fast to the google search from the yahoo one implies it's a template outside of the wiki skin. Very much an Otto question as he's the wiki master.

I use the Special:Search page too and bookmarked it :/

I currently do not have the capability to edit the codex at that level of
detail. For the moment, this sort of thing cannot be changed.

Lorelle,

I've not got the time to head up the update/reorg, but I'm happy to pitch
in any content you want to assign to me. I'll take a look in a bit, and see
if I have any suggestions for the update.

Just copy and paste a bunch of links and I can take it from there. I'm
starting to compile a list, but I fear missing something since the search
is so painful.

Thanks!

Otto: Link spawning wasn't in there originally, so something has changed
fairly recently. Can you find out who changed it? I know there MUST be a
good reason, but this breaks web standards and one thing WordPress loves is
standards. ;-)

Thanks!

I already know who changed it. I did. :)

This is because we switched over to the Google Search when Yahoo's search
discontinued their API and the searches stopped working. This didn't
involve changing anything on the codex, which I don't have access to change
right now. Google's results have the new window target set, and seemingly
no way to make it not do that. I'll look into it, but I see nothing on a
cursory glace at the docs.

The search box in the header isn't a site or area specific search. Never
has been, AFAIK. It's a search for all of WordPress.org, on all pages. The
wording possibly needs work. Use Special:Search if you only want to search
the codex.

You are the hero of the month! Thank you!!!!

The team worked really hard ages ago when the Codex was first integrated
into the main site to keep the search exclusive to the Codex. I think MT
was working on it but I can't remember. It was in 2007 or 2008 but I'd have
to dig to find blame. ;-)

Anyway, it was really important to not confuse people when they search. For
a while, it was broken up by Codex and other org stuff but it was combined
probably when the switch to Google search was done.

If we can't change it, then we have to up our game in writing keyword heavy
stuff in all the docs to ensure they come in first on the search. I do
automatically, but maybe it's time to go through and make sure that all the
documents get equal time in the search results.

Thanks!!!!

Lorelle

I'm going to link to 
http://codex.wordpress.org/First_Steps_With_WordPress from the new 
post-install welcome area in 3.3 (putting the real content into trunk 
now). This page is a little outdated, though, shows Kubrick as default 
and describes it, etc. Could you mavens of documentation take a scrub 
through this page and make it a little more up-to-date? Maybe remove the 
plug for Codex and Forum Searcher Plugin 
<http://asymptomatic.net/2005/07/20/944/codex-searcher/> since it just 
links off to an external site, clean up the old plugin repo links, link 
to wordpress.org/showcase instead Matt's list of "hot sites" from 6 
years ago... you get the picture.

This page will soon be getting a lot of attention as a first-timer's 
resource, so making it super-awesome would be great. I'll check it again 
in RC and update anything that still needs fixing before we launch 3.3.

Thanks!

A layman's request!

Presently, if you want to view a bigger size image (of the thumbnail
embedded in the Codex page) it takes two clicks and 2 pages. Could not
the bigger size image come on a Lightbox, Fancybox or a similar popup
layer?

Please explore the possibility of enabling that provision.

Thanks.

Could you point to an example?

The issue we have is that the Codex is not a blog. It is on MediaWiki and
there are limitations on what can be done. Maybe Michael might know of a
feature that will automatically show the full size version of an image from
a thumbnail. I haven't found one over the years.

Thanks,

Thanks for your response.

I think there are extensions to Mediawiki to incorporate such a
feature, as found on this page:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:LightboxThumbs

Though it is not a priority, it will surely enhance user experience.

Just remember, we're on an older version of MediaWiki :)

That should work on 1.15, though.

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GeeQuBox would be a better app overall, but it/s 1.16 or higher.

LOL! Don't let me start a creative force. Just let me know when you're done
and I'll plow through it. It's not a competition, it just sounded like your

of them. Anyone up on that want to take this on? Let me know and I will

So, basically, some text regarding the classes added via body_class() and
post_class()? e.g.

body_class():
.term-post-format-{format}
.single-format-{format}

post_class():
.format-{format}

That sort of thing?

If we're going to update that page, though, it would be nice to see some
additional improvements, such as consolidation/elaboration regarding
supported formats and styling conventions of those formats. Also, adding
mention of the get_template_part( $file, get_post_format() ) technique
would be useful.

Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress Integration with Social Media
Message-ID: <CAN2v4ZQhk-yrx0qdxCA0QNdN5AjHgVwEGjVz1R7Txr9Eyk5+LA@mail.gmail.com>

Working on the final touches to the update on Where to start with WordPress
doc and realized that integration with social media isn't anywhere on the
Codex. This brings up a lot of questions.

There are a lot of WordPress Plugins and Widgets to help integrate social
media into WordPress, and there is code to manually to Themes. There are
also some ways to do this with the default Widgets, so where and how should
we write up something like this for the Codex without overwhelming the
article with Plugins we have to keep updated, and information that can
quickly go out of date.

This is incredibly important information, but I'm not sure what information
would be best to put into the Codex.

Thought?

Whatever they call it, the top of this article needs serious fixing. We

I'll do that, but will probably wait until the day that 3.3 is released-just

I think that's a bit outside the realm of the codex, actually. Better
suited for blogs and independent tutorials and such, because
documenting that stuff doesn't really fall into the "WordPress"
category, except insofar as modifying themes and using plugins and
such.

Plus, it's a constantly moving target, new functionality is introduced
by Facebook pretty much monthly at this point (and none of it really
works until like 6 months later, at which point there's a giant
privacy outrage over it and they remove or limit it 2 months later).

Aren't we in freeze mode yet?

Most of the stuff needing fixing isn't very version specific, mostly
cleaning for cleaning sake as it's too wordy and takes to long to get to
the point.

You are the master at beautiful language, so I'll let it in your loverly
hands!

We're in feature freeze, but (for example) the admin bar got shifted 
around a little in regards to which was where (Screen Options and 
contextual Help menus in particular).

I added in 3.3's admin bar stuff, but left in the 3.0-3.2 data, since 
there's going to be a while before everyone upgrades, and I've noticed 
that having the 'Yes, it was there, now it's here' info helps people in 
the Network page.

However I don't think that should be extended to the less ... um ... 
not important, but I hope y'all know what I mean, footer section, which 
is now a menu item.

That's what I thought, but the more I think about it, the more I think it
could have value if we say something and link to appropriate tags in the
Plugin Directory.

Like defining what integration means. In my classes I call them Share,
Push, and Pull - Share means you "share" information manually through
social media, Push is to tell the world through social media, and pull is
to bring social media to your blog.

Using that analogy, it would be ideal for the Codex to cover getting a
short link to share manually (aren't they adding the short URL to the
core?), examples of how to automate the process to push posts to social
media, and how to use the Feed Widget to pull social media stuff into the
site, and feature links to Plugin tags that do the pushing and pulling for
examples of WordPress Plugins that make it easier.

This could be a WordPress Lesson. I'm sure there are more sophisticated
techniques, but I think we need to have a page that gives some basics to
answering the question of how and can I integrate my blog to social media.

More brainstorming ideas?

You did some great work on it, Mika, we just need to lead them to the water
faster. It's not that it isn't unimportant, just to the point.

Thanks for letting me know the bar got shifted (no pun - okay, pun. :D ).

We had it originally set up so that page offered a TOC layout with links to
the specific panels on subpages. Now the whole thing is back into a single
page. Just trying to brainstorm some ways to make it clearer and easier to
navigate and process.

Ideas?

Shortlinks are already in core, have been since... err.. 2.9 or 3.0. I
use them in my Simple Twitter Connect and Simple Facebook Connect
plugins (Simple Google Connect is in progress).

I dunno. I think this is too big a concept, with too many opinions*
and ways of doing it. "Integration" is a big thing, with a lot of
separate sub-topics and such. You can break it down into parts, but
even in those parts there's dozens of possible ones, each has
different upsides and downsides, etc.

-Otto


* my opinions and methods for doing this sort of thing are the only
correct ones, of course, but not everybody agrees. ;)

What's still going to change before launch:
- text/images on about.php are being updated today.
- some help tab content.
Think that's it.

English has been tightened and the images of the Screen Options are 
3.3-ified.  (Okay, it's wrong, but editing the HTML via Chrome's 
inspector to be more 'vague' and less me was so silly and fun!)

Maybe the Admin Bar could be it's own little 'section' and not such a 
huge CHUNK of text at the top?  Seeing that would make Newbie Me feel 
like this wasn't the page I wanted to show me what all the standard bits 
and togs were.

FYI, Admin Bar + old Dashboard header = Toolbar. That's what we're going 
to call it now. If you're on trunk, take a look at /wp-admin/about.php 
to see how we're talking about the new stuff.

an example of a well written Plugin in the Codex. Otto, I think that's
yours, isn't it? Is that still a good example?

+1 to giving the Admin Bar... er, Toolbar its own section - if not its own

Just on a quick skim, under where you talk about themes, include a link to
widgets. ;)

I was also thinking custom header & menus but not all themes include those.

Cleaned up a little and tightened up some of the name calling of stuff. :D

Ready for a look through. My last glance just found "botton" for "button."
Oops!

Widgets added. Good catch.

Custom headers and menus...that's kind of obvious on a per theme basis, so
not sure about that one, Menus...do we have a good guide to custom menus?
I'll dig. I so HATE the search on the Codex again, so it's hard to find
stuff.

ARGH! They aren't called Custom Menus but Navigation Menus on the Codex.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Navigation_Menus

Hmm. Did the name change? Should I change the title to Custom Menus? What
is going to be more helpful here?

LOL! Love the PS at the end.

Let's see what others think. I'm not looking for a full blown thesis, just
something that let's the world know that these shortcodes are there and how
to use them, and talk about how to add feeds and such. That's where the
Codex really excels, not in trying to answer everything.

Thanks,

Lorelle

It has it's own section, and since much of the 'footer' stuff is in it 
now, I shifted those to that section as well, and made links. Whew.

Course now that I did it, I think "Gee, Mika, you wrote that thinking 
of 3.3 and not 3.2, so some people might get confused looking at stuff 
for the next month..."

Have we ever had a feature freeze that wasn't "thawed" at RC1?

Didn't we just add a new version of jQuery with new features after 2 Beta's?

Didn't Jane just write a blog post asking us for our opinion on a widget 'feature' the core team are still looking to add, even though we've had 3 Beta's and twice missed the proposed release date of RC1?

If Capital_P_Dangit taught us nothing else, it's that the code freeze is only a freeze once it's actually been released. Until then, it's just a little chilly ;)

Actually, it's been in trunk. What is more recent (and very beta-type 
stuff) is realizing that the way it was implemented could have 
unintended effects. Hence the poll. We're not adding a new widgets 
feature this late in the game, just gut checking a parameter before it's 
too late this cycle.

I think something really brief on what social media is, and how it
"integrates" with WP. Sometimes people use a lot of buzzwords and verbiage
only to find what they really want is a link in the sidebar or somewhere.

So highlighting that it's twofold - pushing posts out to social media, and
just linking out to social media sites, and directing to different
search terms for the plugins repo.

Nope, not mine. Author/owner is jtsternberg.

Looks like he's been keeping it up to date to me. I wish he used the

Which tells me that it might not be a good example. Do we have a good
"working example" that will stand the test of at least a little bit of time
to showcase for a quality WordPress Plugin that we can use in tutorials?

Great job. Looking good.  Watch for opportunities to add WordPress Themes,
WordPress Loop, and WordPress Plugins at every place possible to keep this
in the SEO eyeballs.

In the first code example you write about the callback function and don't
give a clear example of that. Give it for the clueless. :-)

Great stuff. Thanks,  lorelle

Are you saying that every place "Theme" appears, I should use "WordPress
Theme", and likewise for "WordPress Loop", "WordPress Plugin", etc.? Or
only for anchor link text? (A certain amount of bile begins to rise at the
suggestion to wordsmith merely for the sake of SEO, but I'll do my best to
follow marching orders. :) )

I've added in an example after_setup_theme callback function for
add_theme_support(). Good catch!

Otherwise: is this on the right track?  I've tried to reorganize the
information a bit more logically, and take out much of the informal tenor
of the prose - but what might be logical to me may be illogical to others.

(Future project: all of the "Theme Features" pages would benefit from
having a consistent structure; I tried to emulate others, such as
Navigation Menus, Post Thumbnails, etc, but all were slightly different.)

I have this note in the discussion of the resultant admin screen:

Adding Theme support exposes the Post Format meta box on the Edit Post
page. This metabox includes a radio-select list of the Post Format types
for which the Theme has enabled support. *(Note: "Standard" indicates that
no Post Format type has been selected.)*


I think it fits more appropriately there; in the first sentence, I think it
would be superfluous and potentially misleading?

Not every place but in the first paragraph where they come up. Anchor Text
is lovely, too, but it needs to be like:

WordPress Themes that support the feature can customize the layout and
styling of posts according to Post Format type, generally by altering the
WordPress Loop output for posts with a given Post Format type, or by
targeting specific CSS classes applied to such posts.

Post doesn't have to be capitalized, only Pages. PITA. :D

The WordPress Loop is usually referred to as the WordPress Loop as opposed
to other loops like around the neck and so on. :D

It's definitely on the right track, and good catch on cutting back on some
of the informal tenor but watch the over scholarly stuff as it confuses
people who "just want to fix the f#$king Theme." We put the really informal
language into WordPress Lessons and work hard to find an even, educated,
but not over the top language (filled with too much jargon) on the rest.
You're doing great.

Just be careful not to present something that will clunk the reader. The
callback function is an example. Link to everything and anything that looks
like a "new thought" to help them figure out what it is if they don't know,
and you've got it.

Totally on the right (write) track. Love it.

And you are right about the Themes documents. A lot of work needs to go
into all of them. They are on my to do list, which I'm updating on the
WordPress.com Codex Docs Team To Do List blog even as I write this.

I'm also thinking about doing a couple of projects to get more activity on
the Codex and will need some leadership to help cover bases. I want to
start motivating WordPress Meetup groups to have a "Codex meetup" or even a
social day dedicated to working on the Codex. I'm going to work with my new
college classes to maybe get them to do a session working on the Codex as
well to set an example. Got some ideas that might help or some things to
add to the to do list for such a project?

Thanks!

Lorelle

Every time I see "exposes" I think of that famous poster of the mayor of
Chicago (I think it was) "flashing" a famous art landmark. We had a version
of that in Seattle with someone "flashing" the Space Needle wearing an old
trench coat on posters around the city when I was growing up. Good word
choice, but cracks me up every time. Sorry.

I think the paragraph needs a bit of rewrite to make your point.

With Theme support for Post Formats enabled on the WordPress Theme, the
Edit Post screen features a radio-select list in a metabox for the Post
Format types set in the functions.php file. The user can select which Post
Type format they wish....

How is that? That shouldn't confuse things.

Got more to add to the list?

I'm looking for a list of things to do related specifically to the upcoming
version. Want to add to this list and get us all motivated. Some of us
might be doing family things over the next few weeks, and the rest of us
will be glued to the Codex and the nightlies. :D

Thanks all!

Indecent exposure, to be sure. We cannot have that! My attempt at
wordsmithing that 'graph:

Once a WordPress Theme has added support for Post Formats, the Edit Post
page displays a metabox with a radio-select list of the Post Format types
supported by the Theme. The user can then select the appropriate Post
Format type for the current post.


I also embellished a bit in the explanatory note regarding "Standard".

Lorelle,
i'd be glad to take on the WordPress Login article.
could have something drafted in a few days, that, as you write:
"dissects the login panel and offers tips for customization."

Sorry for the delay in responding. Have at it. Basically, we need something
that discusses the hooks and functions that work with the login for
customization. That would be brilliant. Thanks!

Jane,

The section which needs updating with respect to uploading plugins is also caught up in a bit of a loop with?http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Add_New_Plugins?which sends the reader right back to?http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins for information about downloading and installing plugins.?

Hope I'm not stepping on any toes: I'm new here, but I am a technical writer who uses Wordpress.

Jan C.

Welcome! Re toe-stepping, not at all: technical writers who use 
WordPress are exactly the people we need contributing to the Codex. Feel 
free to take a stab at editing both pages for accuracy. For the record, 
I'll often mention one specific page needing to be updated, but it's 
usually linked to/from several. Going down the rabbit hole of updates 
can be great fun if you like that kind thing. If not, updating the 
single page will mainly mean that the others don't get caught until 
later, but you can also email the list to see if someone else wants to 
pick up where you left off.

Thanks for the welcome, Jane.

Welcome! Re toe-stepping, not at all: technical writers who use WordPress are exactly the people we need contributing to the Codex. Feel free to take a stab at editing both pages for accuracy. For the record, I'll often mention one specific page needing to be updated, but it's usually linked to/from several. Going down the rabbit hole of updates can be great fun if you like that kind thing. If not, updating the single page will mainly mean that the others don't get caught until later, but you can also email the list to see if someone else wants to pick up where you left off.

Nothing has changed for plugin management between 3.2 and 3.3.

Looks good. Only 10 things! Most of these are just general Codex guideline
stuff. This is brilliant and exactly what I was dreaming of!

NOTE FOR ALL: I adore the visual image under Login Hooks that we can all
use as an example of a great idea. It shows the login form with the filters
and actions for the key points visually helping people understand better
what and how these hooks work. NICE!!! Have we done that before? If not, we
need to do it more. Well done!

1. Can you make the intro paragraph a little more formal. I like the
"gateway" part but the "keeps everyone out" is just a little harsh and not
very technical.

2. Is it "where" or "how" to login? Just thinking.

3. Consistency. Use login, log in, not Log in unless it is the start of a
sentence. We had a discussion last year on the proper usage of log in
verses login. Most use login, but I'm not sure who won in that long
discussion. Might we worth a check.

4. We decided a couple months ago not to use example.com/wordpress/ in
examples as it is a keyword and causes all kinds of problems.
example.com/directory/ I think was a good alternative.

5. "The other goes to your site's front." Consider "The other link goes to
the front page of your WordPress site." (Need to get those keywords in
there!)

6. "Customize the Logo and Link" I think might be better titled as
"Customize the Log In/Login" whichever word wins the day.

7. Your examples are great but a bit confusing. The first proposes
replacing the logo and describing where the image was stored. Nice. Then
you talk about how this doesn't really put "the image" into the login but
adds a background image, which takes the user to a new level of web design
understanding. I recommend that you introduce it something like this (make
it better):

The WordPress logo is set with a combination of HTML and CSS, a heading tag
wrapped around a link to your site. The heading tag features the background
image of the logo.

<h1><a href....</a></h1>

You can change the background image with your site logo or a company logo
in the WordPress Theme's functions.php by using [[WordPress hooks]] such as
with this example using an image stored in the active Theme subdirectory
named /images.

code here

- - -

Does that make a little more sense in the flow of understanding how it
works? I'm just trying for clarity.

8. I love "Login with Style" but maybe we need to make it a little more
boring with "Styling Your Login." Hate squashing fun things like that, but
I want those search keywords to be really relevant as we're currently
fighting with EVERYTHING WordPress.org in the search results. LOVE the
great specific CSS selectors list. Excellent!!! Don't assume they've read
the previous parts at this point and add instructions on the placement of
the function code in the functions.php.

"For instance, WordPress uses this CSS, in login.css), to insert the
logo..." Not sure what happened but this should be more assertive and
cleaned up to be something like, "WordPress uses the following CSS in the
login.css stylesheet to insert the logo and hide the heading text..." And
I'm THRILLED you added that to help clarify the point and help those who
wish to use text and not an image. They have to change that in order to see
the text (where is it? Where did it go?). :D

9. Let's make Customizing the WordPress Login the prime header for that
section and Styling the Login, Login Hooks, and Make a Custom Login Page
subheads for that section.

10. Can you provide a clean example of using the wp_login_form under custom
login page?

Great job!!!!!!

Thanks,

Lorelle

I continue to be approached by good people in video production and
screencasts about helping to add these to the Codex. I think the time to
bring this discussion up is here again as the interface is staying fairly
stable, making these efforts last longer. I've talked to these people and
they are willing to volunteer their time with no "credit" just giving back
as we all do. They are hard to find, but they are out there and willing to
help.

With the changes in bandwidth, screen resolution, and tech, let's take
another group discussion look at how we can integrate these into the Codex.
Thoughts?

I'm trying to get a loan of Michael Pick (who does the launch videos) to 
do a bunch of short screencasts we could use in help tabs and/or 
documentation as we start to plan the next iteration of wordpress.org. 
If we do videos I'd like for them to be as consistent as possible.

Excellent. That's the plan from the start is consistency. And is there
already a group or discussion on the "next iteration of wordpress.org?"

As for the Codex and dreams that it will someday be able to be updated to
take advantage of new features, MichaelH and some others did research a
while back on how to integrate video into the Codex. What's the current
status on how to and the technical aspects. So we're prepared.

Thanks,

Lorelle

Core team and Matt will be discussing at the core team meetup in just 
under two weeks.

There is no status b/c no one has been working on it. When the community 
handyman position is filled, that person will be assigned to supporting 
all the community sites, vs now when it's dependent on nabbing Otto, 
Nacin, or Boren in between other stuff that often takes priority. So my 
hope is that we can put together a good plan for early 2012, ID which 
things can be done by volunteers and which things require 'the keys to 
the kingdom,' and then put together an actual project plan with a set 
scope and timeline. But won't know for sure until after the core meetup.

Okay, I've gotten far enough that, as this is my first Codex project, some
of (or a lot of) you may want to have a gander at what I've done. There are
still a couple of works in progress (WIPS), and I'm still finding my
footings using wikispeak styling, but all in all, I think I'm getting there.
Once this page is squared away, I think I'll have a look at the octopus
associated with this specific page. It looks like it needs some loving care
and attention:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins

Btw, I hope it's okay to use inline styling the way I did, where I did, per
the wiki Grandmaster rules: I find it tends to often work better than the
quote quote quote approach to bold.

Is still focused on manual uploading and updating of plugins, should give
equal time and prioritize within-dashboard installation and updating since
it's more common now.

Would also be good to have a bit under troubleshooting that suggests turning
off all plugins and re-activating one at a time to see which one is causing
the break.
