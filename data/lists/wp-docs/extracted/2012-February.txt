No. Calling wp_enqueue_script() directly would produce a
_doing_it_wrong() notice with WP_DEBUG on (that was the consensus in
the ticket) and still cause i18n problems (all JavaScript strings will
be displayed in English).

Twenty Ten and Twenty Eleven only call it directly in header.php,
which is after WP_Scripts is properly initialized and therefore is
safe.

Hi All,

Lorelle (and andrea_r) mentioned getting a WordPress Guide together at the end of December.  I am curious if this project was going ahead and if I can sign on to help.  (My apologies if this was better suited for a personal email, but since I hadn't seen the guide mentioned recently on list, I figured I would send it here.)

Thanks!

If you are on the WordPress Documentation team mailing list, you are signed
up. The WordPress Codex is the WordPress Guide. Was there something else
you thought it was? Did I miss something? You can contact me directly at
lorelleonwordpress at gmail.com any time if you wish.

If you wish to participate on the WordPress Codex documentation team and
contribute to the Codex, welcome! Wonderful!

Thanks,

Lorelle

Subject: [wp-docs] Action hooks
Message-ID: <CABMPDWEUspRUhBDwdPTraxGrYcV1-1NTEdOMC07JZ2u=7cEvAg@mail.gmail.com>

I notice that only a few of the many action hooks are documented.

A stub article for each action hook could be produced automatically by
parsing WordPress code. It is not possible to document them fully in
this way, but I think it would be better than nothing. These stubs
could be a one-time import into the Codex as a starting point for
manual editing.

I have a prototype that produces 480 articles in about 80 new
subcategories of Category:Actions. See: http://wiki.co-synergy.com

Is this a worthwhile exercise?

I hold absolutely no sway in this but I support parsing PHPDoc to
automatically add codex pages for every hook and function in WordPress.

Not sure if this idea has been floated before, but what does everybody
think of an IRC room for the Codex chatter? Even if it turns out to be a
place for very minor discussion, it might be a good community builder for
codex contributors, general discussion of codex development, etc. Perhaps
#wordpress-codex?

#wordpress-docs would be better and straddle more methods of 
contribution (could include help tabs, any future non-codex docs, etc). 
I can have sivel set it up if people think they would use it.

Most of the docs team haven't used the IRC channel in ages. It didn't fit into most contributors familiarity with such communications. We used it only during highly active campaigns.

Remember that the docs team is a very diverse group with many with little such experience.

I miss it but it took too much work to train people to use it. It also doesn't save very well for reference.

I'm not sure where you mean by "in the Views" -- can you give a URL? 
Nothing for docs is listed at http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC.

Here's the list of official channels that are logged. 
https://irclogs.wordpress.org/
If we want to have an official docs channel, it's a simple thing to add 
it to the list for archiving.

Just FYI, as I write this I'm answering someone's question about editing a
codex page in #wordpress-docs.

Just my humble opinion: IRC lends to creating a highly active,
fast-developing community. WordPress core development groups have weekly
meetings on IRC to plan, review and mobilize, which I also might even
suggest for the codex, although I'm relatively new here and don't want to
step on any toes with tons of suggestions.

Setting up an IRC client is something that could be laid out in a tutorial
in a matter of a few screenshots and simple layperson text, which I would
be happy to help with. :)

See yall in #wordpress-docs maybe?

Sorry, I was in the car stuck in traffic.

It appears it was removed, put back  in, and removed, etc. as several of us
maintained it alone for years with rarely a visitor.

http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=IRC&diff=111478&oldid=17564 is
one example.

#wordpress-docs was the channel.

I'm thrilled if the team would like to give IRC another try. However, the
key editors and experts on the Codex may not be able to monitor it so
someone must report back in. We're still waiting on an official docs P2 or
otherwise blog which we feel will be much more helpful than the mailing
list or IRC for tracking tasks.

Thanks for the irclogs site. That will be very helpful.
