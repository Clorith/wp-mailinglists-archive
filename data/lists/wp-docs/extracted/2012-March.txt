Evan Cordulack is currently attacking the long list of articles needed for
the WordPress Lessons area of the Codex, expanding upon WordPress Lessons.
He's just finished his first contribution
http://codex.wordpress.org/How_to_Use_Gravatars_in_WordPress

http://codex.wordpress.org/Gravatars has been converted into a historical
article as it contains more advanced information on how Gravats work with
hashing and such as reference.

He's busy at work on the next article for WordPress Lessons on comments,
digging into the basics of how they work and all the things you can do with
them in WordPress.

Much thanks and applause needs to come his way! Give the article a go over
to see if we missed anything.

You say he's finished the article on Gravatars and is busy at work on
the next one, but the article is still marked as a rough draft, and it
doesn't look finished to me. When it's finished I'll take a closer
look at it.

The information about how Gravatars work isn't "historical". It's
still true, as far as I can tell.

I've moved the article and will remove the rough draft. It looks very
finished, so I'd like to know what you think is missing. The article is not
meant to be highly technical as that is what "Using Gravatars" is for. This
is designed to fit within WordPress Lessons with basics on using Gravatars.

By "historical" I meant as reference material. It is not important to the
typical Gravatar user to understand hashing and encoding, the underlying
aspects of how Gravatars work. It is most important they know why they
should get one, that it is a built-in function, how to design in and around
them, and answer the question "how do I get pictures next to comments."

Thanks,

Lorelle

Does anyone have a problem with me making some changes to this entry?
http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Frameworks

I would like to revise, to clarify between Theme framework as "drop-in code
library" and Theme framework as "stand-alone base/starter Theme".

Thanks,

That's been on my to do list for ages, so go for it.

On my notes to expand the article include:

* Better explanation and definition of framework.
* Updating the list with free frameworks.
* Explaining the difference between a framework and WordPress Theme.
* A list of the code and features that could be in a framework.
* How to treat it differently or the same as a Theme.
* Why choose a framework over a Theme.
* Can any Theme be a framework.
* How to convert a PSD/Wireframe to framework (possibly new article or
reference point)
* How to Child Theme a Framework (it's a little different as you are adding
all the styles not just changing specific styles)
* Thoughts/Suggestions/Tips/Techniques for creating a Framework in
WordPress (in other words - while it can "do it all" maybe it shouldn't).

Not sure you want to take all that on, Chip, but that's on my list if
anyone else wants to pitch in.

Thanks!

Most of those are on my list. :) It's a topic that occasionally comes up
for the Theme Review Team, so I want to make sure that the terminology is
consistent. See here for more:
http://make.wordpress.org/themes/2012/03/14/theme-frameworks-and-namespacing-guidelines/

PSD conversion is probably outside the scope, but if someone wants to
tackle an entry for that, it would be good to link from the Theme
Development entry.

I'll take on as much as I can, and perhaps leave the last couple of points
to others who can speak to those aspects better than I can.

Thanks,

Chip

Excellent.

And on the point of the Theme Review Team, am I missing a doc that spells
out all the details of how the Theme Review Team works and a checklist in
the Codex? We really need something like that to guide people not just
through the process (how do I get my Theme to the Review Team, update it,
maintain it, support it...etc.) but gives a good list of what the team
looks for and condemns in the review process.

Thanks!!!

Lorelle

Ah yes! Forgot I had that on my "MUST EDIT" list...the list is soooo long.
Need more time in the day.

LOL!

That one is back up at the top of the list of fixing. Thanks!

What are you wanting to edit on that one? Please tread lightly; Theme
developers have been using that list for almost two years now as THE
"go-to" source for Theme Review requirements. Any content changes would
have a major impact to ongoing reviews.

Thanks,

Chip

Agreed. This page really needs to be owned by the theme review team. The 
only outside edits should be for things like spelling or typos.

I've started adding some updates:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Frameworks#WordPress_Theme_Frameworks

Let me know if I'm on the right path, before I get too much farther. I'll
also start digging for more-recent examples of "frameworks".

Thanks,

Chip

The Theme Review page doesn't meet the basic format guidelines of the Codex
which begins with an explanation on what the page is about. It's importance
is not in question, and I'm sorry that it escaped attention this long. A
simple "this is about x, y, z" is all that is needed at the top with a few
formatting changes to make it match the consistency of the Codex.

Can you link those format guidelines for me? I'll be happy to bring the
Theme Review page up to standard.

Sorry for the delay. We've had storms passing through and electricity has
been hit and miss much of last week and I'm still catching up with emails.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Contributing

http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Styles

http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines

The style guide is pretty specific. It needs to open with a descriptive
paragraph so people will understand the purpose of the page, which is what
this page needs. The rest is fine. It would then match the look and feel of
all the pages on the Codex.

Thanks,

Lorelle

hi there,

I'm up for collaborating on the WordPress guide in Codex.
I've just published a guide on flossmanuals here
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress

It still needs a bit of a proofread, but we are on the case with that,
give us 4 weeks or so.

It's an update to a guide that various group were using (like tactical
tech and people's voice media). It's got a focus on promoting creating
communities online and promoting free speech.

Anyway, there is material there including screenshots that can be lifted
and imported into the codex. I'm happy to suggest bits and do that baed
on feedback. Let me know the best way of doing that, is it via a page on
the codex?

nice one

I've been waiting over 30 minutes for the page to load on the site, so
forgive the delay. As soon as there is more than one page to view, I'll
give you some feedback on what might be appropriate for inclusion in the
Codex after some editing to comply with Codex writing standards.

Thanks,

Lorelle

Did you mean to delete

If so, we need someone to restore that page.

The search on the Codex has been broken for a while. Any chance of fixing
that soon?

I'm now using Google's site search and looking up video embeds I found:

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Viva_viagra_video_commercial

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Levitra_funny_video

These are spams that were deleted but they show up in Google search results
as a deleted page (WTF?), which is as good as them being left there to be
found. The key issue is that we've asked since the beginning to have User
pages blocked from search results and search engines. Any chance of that
happening since another search I did on viagra, sex, porn, and our other
favorite words on the Codex turned up more deleted page results with the
deleted content accessible in the page's content?

Thanks!

Is the CODEX search broken -- http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Search

Or do you mean the search at the top of the pages that goes to http://wordpress.org/search/ ? Those are different things.

As for deleted pages... Welcome to a Mediawiki flaw. It's moronic but the way Google and MediaWiki talk, this is what they WANT to happen. :/ It's useful to non-Admins when someone nukes a page, but the rest of the time I sit and wonder what they were smoking.

Someone with ssh access would have to run the following scripts:

Go to the maintenance folder and run

$ php purgeoldtext.php

(see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:PurgeOldText.php That will delete all revisions for all deleted pages.)

Then you'd probably want to run either rebuildall.php or rebuildrecentchanges.php. http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Rebuildall.php is documented but the other's pretty obvious.

Thanks. I mean the search at the top of the page. That's broken. It's the
one that EVERYONE uses, not just those who know a few tricks. :D It works
on the rest of the site but not when "in" the Codex.

There are ways to prevent indexing the User pages through robots.txt, etc.,
too, the easy way out.

As for those with the capacity to run scripts in the maintenance folder...I
have no clue who that would be any more.

Thanks!

It's not broken, it's just labeled wrong.

The header search box searches all of WordPress.org. This is
site-wide, and intentional.

The incorrect label will eventually be fixed.

When the user was in the Codex, the search was limited to the Codex. It
used to say "search Codex" in the search field. We set it up that way ages
ago. Either way, it stopped working a while ago. I get nothing when I use
the search box at the top.

Is anyone else getting nothing in the searches?

When I run a search, it comes up with content, just not codex-specific content. Takes a minute, since the Google search is worse than the old Yahoo one.

And THAT bakes my brain a little. o.O

Seems to work fine to me, however you're correct that it is not
limited to the Codex any longer.

Yahoo discontinued their search services last year, leaving our site
searches broken for months before somebody noticed. I switched it over
to Google results at that time. It is not quite as flexible.

I've updated the headers of the codex, but it's cached, so it may take
a while for the view to change properly.

Thanks. Do you have the ability to fix the porn/viagra spam issues, too?

You'll need to be more specific as to what issue you're talking about.

Deleted users with spam links in their user:blah pages shows up in Google.

Earlier I emailed that you could flush the deleted pages from the wiki DB with the php maintenance commands. Or as Lorelle said, a robots.txt to not get them crawled would do it :) I can dig up the email when I get to a grown up computer.

I've finally had time to go through the site's information. I found errors
and I know it's still in development. I don't see anything that isn't
already covered in the WordPress Codex and Learn WordPress, and the inline
help files. Did you have a specific article in mind that you thought might
port over to the Codex?

Thanks,

Lorelle
