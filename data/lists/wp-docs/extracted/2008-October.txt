Subject: [wp-docs] PHPDoc and state of the Codex
Message-ID: <48FE1A94.30303@poplarware.com>

So it looks like there was a massive effort to get PHPDoc into 2.7, 
for nearly everything. It's GREAT!! My thanks go out to all who 
participated.

My question today is, what to do about the Codex's Function Reference:
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference

It has always been incomplete and out of sync with the code. Does 
wordpress.org have plans to have an official replacement, generated 
from the PHPDoc, so we can get rid of the Function Reference once and 
for all? There are several useful sites with cross-refs and such 
listed at the bottom of the above Codex page, but none are "official". 
Which would be the most useful? Are there any useful components of the 
Codex Function Reference that should be preserved? Thoughts?

And what about the Template Tags page in the Codex? That is also prone 
to being out of sync, and could be replaced by phpdoc, maybe? We could 
potentially link to the appropriate files that should contain template 
tags. Thoughts?

I am posting to Hackers and Doc, to get a cross section of opinions...

Thanks for doing this. I've been watching this and wondering when it was
ready for the Codex. Is it ready? I'm excited about connecting these dots
better in the Codex. Thanks for staying on this, Jennifer!

I think that the template tags should be updated more often, yes, but I
think the current system would probably be the best for how they are laid
out. My reasoning is based on the assumption that PHPdocs would generate the
basic technical information about each tag, but not really explain it in
paragraph form for the less experienced user (like the php.net manual vs the
w3schools tutorials). Because of this, and because of the inherent
user-friendliness of the template tags, I think that section should continue
to be added to by real people who can take the time to explain the
functions.

But as for the (more advanced) function reference section, I'd like to see
that be automatically generated by PHPdocs.

That's my 0.02624 euros worth

The phpdoc is completed. There are only two files left, but they have 
patches and once the patches are committed the effort will be complete. 
Well, at least my involvement with the phpdoc effort will be completed. 
There are still files in wp-admin/includes that need inline 
documentation, but they are unimportant to most theme and plugin 
developers. I think I'll revisit it when 2.8 is about to be released and 
see, if I can finish that portion, but I seriously doubt I'll put forth 
the effort.

While we are on the subject of online documentation, I'd like to chime
in for official website just like this one:

Hooks Database
http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks
All hooks, sortable by WP version and status (new, deprecated)

...and the same thing for Template Tags.
Sure, http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags is fine, and you can
always switch to http://www.dbswebsite.com/design/wordpress-reference/
for more eye-candy, but a real-deal, parsable & sotable database would
be a blessing, IMHO.

Justin sayin'.
