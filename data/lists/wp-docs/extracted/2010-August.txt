Hi list,

Whilst I can browse the Codex just fine right now, on attempting to 
log-in I'm seeing the rather daunting message

This wiki has a problem -

(Cannot contact the database server: Access denied for user 
'wporg'@'72.233.56.142' (using password: YES))

May be it will go away, but perhaps needs checking out?

Fixed.

Some database changes happened on wp.org and the codex needed to be
updated to be aware of that fact.

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex page on outgoing email configurations?
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=tYhmQQj=zqn1Ggp0Kx2pTAAGa3Nh3ySxSeUnK@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all -

I noticed a need for a small plugin that tests emails sent by WordPress.
It's written and I'm going to put it in the repository, and now I'm looking
for a Codex page that presents the challenges with outgoing emails (the from
address, the need for SMTP, etc.), why we send from
wordpress at yourdomain.comby default, and how to make it work on your
server.

I searched around and couldn't find a page. I have no problem writing one up
(which I then plan to link from the plugin), but I wanted to know if it rang
any bells with you first.

Thanks,
Nacin

I don't recall such a page.

Yeah, I got nothing. Closest I can think of is
function_reference/wp_mail, but nothing on the "why" of it.

That whole thing needs a rethink, I think. Some of it is strange and
doesn't work on a few hosts, although it is better than it used to be.
Dunno. Maybe it should be a core plugin.

Many servers won't relay an email address that doesn't match its domain.
This seems to allow the widest number of setups. Some servers (Bluehost does
this, for example) actually require that the email address exists in their
system.

Other alternatives include omitting the From header entirely, which probably
doesn't work on the majority of setups but apparently works on some. (This
setup might also relay mail from anyone.) Beyond that, some servers won't
relay any email, so the user would have to use a plugin that configures
SMTP.

So it's a tough spot. I think the current situation isn't going to change
because it is a good balance. The plugin I wrote is *very* simple. It tests
wp_mail(), and then will offer a link to a Codex article (which I guess I'll
write) that will also link the user to other plugins such as WP Mail SMTP
that can enable it to work on their servers.

There was some discussion around bundling this feature into the Health Check
plugin (
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/health-check-plugin-feedback-needed-from-forum-regulars)
-- might be something to consider if Health Check is going be a a Core
plugin.

Didn't even think about that. Last I checked, it wasn't in HC, but I'll
write the requisite unit tests. Thanks.
