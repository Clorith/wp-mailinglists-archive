Putting giant red warnings on top of every page that does anything 
useful isn't going to make people who do mess up their installations 
feel any better.

People will be less likely to mess up instructions that are clear, 
concise, and short, rather than something that is overly long which 
means they're just going to skim it. Making things longer does not make 
them better.

Sounds reasonable.

<confused>

Can you cite some specific pages that are problematic? That would make 
them easier to find/fix.

Agreed.

Now, can you provide links to these docs in the Codex?

I have to plead guilty to a good number of those red boxes, as I've put the
Template:Stub on most new articles.  The idea of that template is to note
articles that may not be verified for accuracy, or completeness.  Obviously,
the intention is not to scare off people. Apologies if you've had to take
heat from people complaining about this issue and thank you for posting on
this topic.

A list of those articles can be accessed at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Category:Stubs so please let me know which
articles should be 'unStubbed' and I'll take care of it.  And of course,
anyone can remove the {{Stub}} from deserving articles.

If necessary, the Template at http://codex.wordpress.org/Template:Stub can
be edited to show something other than a red box when {{Stub}} is used.

Regards

MichaelH

I hope this

http://codex.wordpress.org/Template:Stub

is not what Matt is referring to. Because if that is scaring people, we 
need to rethink the whole documentation thing.

-Kaf

P.S. Ok, perhaps some better wording in the stub to explain what and why 
it's there, and YES to removing it from deserving documents. But really, 
is it scaring users?

My guess is that he's referring to something like what you can see at
the top of this cached page (the live version has been changed
already):

I don't think there's anything wrong with that stub, but I could see an 
argument for putting it at the bottom instead of the top.

Message-ID: <1199463256.5878.2.camel@jon-ubuntu>

I used to edit Wikipedia a lot, and I remember one of its most
user-friendly features was to provide links to the same article in a
different language.

This could be done by placing something like this at the bottom of the
article:

[[de:Hallo]]

This would add a link in the sidebar of the English 'Hello' page for
German viewers.

I tried inserting this in my pages, but it didn't work. Is this feature
deliberately disabled, or is it a bug?

I agree with you, and ask about this some times ago, and as far as I
can remember the answer was that it wasn't possible due to the way
MediaWiki (the wiki tool behind the Codex and Wikipedia) was
installed/configured. Making it possible would require too much work.

For this reason, language page use a prefix. These are not
automatically treated by the software, but it helps link
language-specific pages.

I just updated this page?it looks very similar to the style of Function
Reference and Template Tags now.

I might make them into links like the Function Reference, so each option
will have a subpage. Is this a good idea, or should they all just stay
on the same page?

My opinion: no. There is only a small amount of information on each 
option, and having each one on a separate page only makes sense to me 
if there is quite a bit of info to report on each item.

Yes -- please put it on Developer Documentation, and also on the 
Plugin Resources and Templates pages as well (so that people looking 
specifically for plugin or theme programming info can find it). It 
would also be good to link it on the pages where the various options 
functions are documented, if you haven't already done that.

Thanks for creating this page! Looks great!

Scrap this thread. I am actually able to edit the wiki. I am an idiot, I
didn't see the edit link on the RHS.

Apologies.

I don't blame you. It's hard to find, and if you're logged in with my
account, it doesn't even show up. Nobody believes me, though, so I don't
think anybody's bothered to fix it.

That's probably what's driven me away from the Codex.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins

We had a nice, large collection of plugins listed under a few dozen 
categories here. It's gone now. Was the removal discussed somewhere 
where those involved with the Codex might have seen it?

Are there plans to provide a more effective space for such a plugins 
directory? Extend is not a directory. I have no plans to host my plugins 
on Extend, so the only opportunity I along with others in the same boat 
have to get plugins listed on any semi-official locale was in the Codex 
Plugin pages.

Before replying, let's not get into the weaknesses of using Codex for 
this. I agree with all of them. But it was the only thing we had. If a 
better solution is in the works, fantastic; I'm on board. If not...

Why don't want your plugins on the official repo or wp-plugins.net?

Probably the same reason as me -- I like the freedom of my own hosting
(I like to use bzr for version control) and don't want to have this
duplicated in the wp-plugins.org SVN.

If I could just have my plugin listed, not hosted, then I'd be there in
a flash. (not the proprietary /dev/dsp-hogging sort)

Kaf,

Lorelle's comment on those deleted Plugin pages is::
"deleted per July 2006 decision to remove Plugin lists from Codex"

and could be related to the same comment made when the Theme pages were
purged in September 2007:
"changed link to direct users to Theme Viewer per Matt's decision in July"

Thanks Michael. But the Theme Viewer, if at times a difficult one to 
deal with (especially these days), is at least a directory of themes 
that replaced the themes list on Codex. There has been no respective 
change in the case of plugins.

I had a few problems with the dev tools on wp-plugins early on that seem 
to have been ironed out over time, but if the site has ever been flagged 
as semi-officially attached to wp.org, I've not noticed it.

So, for this guy in the forum:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/153706?replies=1
should I answer that Lorelle and Matt decided to eliminate the Translation
and Languages plugins list but didn't offer anything to replace it?

(On the "Extend" barely 5 - five - plugins are related to multilingual
issues)

Do I really?

I don't think those types of lists are a good fit for the Codex, and 
certainly not when we have an official dedicated resource for the same 
information.

OK that's a bit of an unfair truncating of Matt's reply, but I couldn't help :)

Why would you answer someone asking for help with something that doesn't 
help them?

I checked out the last version of the Translation plugins page:

http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&target=Plugins%2FTranslation_and_Languages&timestamp=20070921170256

There are 14 plugins listed on there. Let's go through them:

http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-plugin-automatic-machine-translation-for-your-blog-in-eight-languages-spanish-french-german-portuguese-italian-japanese-korean-and-chinese/

Seems to have been replaced some time ago by a "Pro" version of the 
plugin that costs $30. They also violate the WordPress GPL license:

"In short the plugin code is not GPL. We do not allow modification of 
the source-code, nor do we permit redistribution or reverse-engineering."

If I had come across this link on that page I would have immediately 
deleted it. This is the #1 thing we're promoting to people interested in 
translation and languages plugins, I suppose because it starts with an 
A? What a terrible user experience.

#2 http://kimmo.suominen.com/sw/charsets/

Seems perfectly legit, however this 9-line plugin is no longer needed in 
WordPress, it fixes a problem that has been fixed in core for 6+ months. 
  It not being there is not a big loss.

#3 
http://carlosquiles.com/indo-european-language-blog/wordpress-translation-plugin/

Another automatic translation plugin. It appears to be well-updated and 
maintained, and would be appropriate for inclusion and promotion on 
WordPress.org. It is in the plugin directory, where it appears to get 
about 50 downloads a week:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/indoeuropean-translator-widget/

(Compare finding the download link on the extend page vs the plugin 
author's page.)

#4 http://kimmo.suominen.com/sw/finquote/

This plugin fixes curly quotes for the Finnish language, seems nice and 
from the same author as #2. Does not appear in the plugin directory, but 
it should.

#5 http://jamietalbot.com/wp-hacks/gengo/

Another high quality listing, also included in the plugin directory 
where it gets about 90 downloads a week:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gengo/

#6 http://www.gringod.com/category/software/gg_translate/

Creates links to translation services. Fine plugin, in wp-plugin.net but 
not the .org directory.

#7 
http://www.nothing2hide.net/wp-plugins/wordpress-global-translator-plugin/

Seems legit, in wp-plugins.net but not .org.

#8 http://dossier.dunker.de/intypo

Looks good, in .net but not .org.

#9 http://jakobj.dk/blog/archives/43

Good plugin, also listed in .org with about 50 downloads a week.

#10 http://poplarware.com/languageplugin.html

Looks good, not listed in either .net or .org.

#11 http://doocy.net/multilingual/

Seems fine, listed in .org, but as you can see on the .org plugin page:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multilingual/

It hasn't been updated since 2005. Judging from the blog, it doesn't 
look like it's going to be, this is also from 2005:

http://doocy.net/archives/2005/10/12/hello-again-remember-me/

#12 http://fredfred.net/skriker/index.php/polyglot

Nice plugin, included in .org, not in .net.

#13 
http://www.24hourtrading.co.uk/blog/2007/05/01/robs-translator-wordpress-plugin-english-to-10-languages-now-ie-compliant/

Seems fine, not in .org or .net.

#14 http://www.scotthough.com/wordpress-translate/

Not in .net or .org, broken in versions of WP since 2.2. (And this 
information is not reflected on the page.)

#15 http://www.erebe.net/2006/11/17/plugin-traductor-para-wordpress/

Claims to be the same as #14 but in Spanish. Can't tell because the site 
is down. If #14 was in the .org plugin directory, the Spanish 
translation could have just been submitted as a patch.

#16 http://www.worldwidelexicon.org

Looks like an awesome project, but no presence in .net or .org.

So the transition isn't perfect. Even though some bad links are weeded 
out, there were 1 or 2 high quality plugins that aren't listed in the 
directory.

Overall, though, I think the user experience is dramatically better. You 
have a single directory with a consistent way to download, you can 
easily tell when a plugin was updated, and which versions it's 
compatible with. You can see any forum topics related to the plugin, or 
start one. You never have to worry about a site being down, and you're 
not going to follow a promising link to find a plugin that violates the 
GPL and reduces your freedoms.

Rather than complaining about a clunky list being removed, a better use 
of time would be to contact the plugin authors above who aren't on the 
directory yet and ask them to submit their plugin, or if it's GPL, offer 
to do it for them. It's about more than version control, it's about 
distribution, quality control, and a consistent interface for users.

If the plugins are in the directory but hard to find, consider 
submitting patches that improve how plugins are tagged.

> (On the "Extend" barely 5 - five - plugins are related to multilingual

With a few trivial searches I found these:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/indic/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multilingual-posts/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jlanguage/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multilingual/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gengo/

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/indoeuropean-translator-widget/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bunnys-language-linker/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/auto-translator/

There are also a ton of new plugins being added every day, in fact I 
just approved another language one that should be showing up within a 
few days.

I think pointing the forum author to some of those would be a perfectly 
fine answer to the question you posed above.
