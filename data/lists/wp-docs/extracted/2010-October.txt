A quick note to any codex mods or, in fact, anyone just to be aware and 
keep and eye out.

The other day I noticed that some subtle changes had been made to the 
"WordPress in your Language" page, where some very spamish links (to 
mobile phone sites) had been added in as citiations to some of the 
language variants.

I removed these links, and blocked the contributor (the account had no 
other contributions apart from these links) However, this did not stop, 
as the person registered another account to try to add the same things 
back in. I did the same again.

The account holder then emailed me through the "email user" function to 
ask why the links had been removed.  I replied and said that I found 
them to be spammy etc. but suggested that he can contact any of the 
other site mods if he wanted them re-instated, as they may feel 
differently. He chose not to do that (I guess) but instead sent me an 
alternative list of links. Frankly I found those little better (still 
unrelated link hoard sites) but decided not to reply any further by 
email, having already made it clear that he should go elsewhere if he 
wants another opinion.

However, last night it looks like instead of taking that advice, he 
chose to deface the page and try and put the links back again.

Obviously I've blocked and reverted it all (though I may have caught 
Fergusman's edits in the crossfire, haven't checked yet if they were 
valid) but this really is just a heads-up for you folk to be aware of 
the situation.

Spammers, it seems, sadly, are back on the Codex.

(Incidentally, when I was trying to save the older page the first time, 
the spam filter rejected a number of links - first time I've ever seen 
that fire)

Cheers

Did you note an IP address or anything we can use to block this
particular user?

This is odd that they went as far as they did to contact and discuss
this. Very unusual. Thanks for fighting the good fight for all of us.

I'm not sure if the Codex logs that information, I do think that the 
last-used IP address is autoblocked for "a while" though.

I know, it's very odd.  Especially after coming back and defacing the 
pages some more. :/
