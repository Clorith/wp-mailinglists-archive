Subject: [wp-docs] Limiting search to Codex
Message-ID: <4316612A.8030104@cameraontheroad.com>

It was an experiment but it worked. I've been frustrated over the 
inclusion of the Yahoo search on Codex bringing me tons of unrelated to 
Codex results and having to thumb through tons of posts and stuff before 
I can get to a single Codex article. But I found a solution!

keyword keyword site:codex.wordpress.org

It limits the search from right inside the search box to only results 
within the Codex. It's a handful of stuff to type, but when I'm looking 
ONLY on the codex, this is slick.

Maybe there should be check boxes to limit the search to Forums, Codex, 
or All. Worth considering.

Subject: [wp-docs] Version specific banners for Codex
Message-ID: <4316FDC4.5050204@cameraontheroad.com>

We talked about the different ways to set version-specific areas and 
articles in the Codex. I and others have played around with various 
designs but I keep coming back to clean and simple, simple, simple. The 
key is clarity, easy identification and recognition, and keep the focus 
on the content. As one of the volunteers here said, we need to have 
these be an "attraction not a distraction".

I've set up a test document to explore our options with the simple 
banners that can be turned into templates for use on the Codex at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Version_Banners. I've also 
consolidated the ideas that seemed the most consistent with current 
procedure for identifying different version applications. For the 
banners, we picked the darkest color background found in the 
Administration Panels for each version. This reinforces the default 
colors with the appropriate version.

These may change to accomodate the new look of the forum and codex when 
they "combine" and merge, but for now, what do you think?

We also need to make a decision about using v1.6 or 1.5 (with v or 
without) in the titles and references to denote version.

Lorelle--just a couple of comments about this:

1.  If there's to be a page for Site Architecture 1.5 and one for 1.6,
consider not using the letter V in the page title.  Use of lower case 'v'
and upper-case 'V' tends to cause problems.  See
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MichaelH/Wiki_Tips_and_Tricks#Linking_correctly_to_The_Loop
for an example of 'the problem'.

2.  If a banner says 1.5+  does that mean 1.5 and higher or just 1.5.x
versions?

3.  If banners are assigned using a MediaWiki template, remember the
template gets rendered when the page is saved.  If you make changes to the
template you have to edit and save each page that uses the template so that
it gets re-rendered.

4.  Maybe Codex should only document the latest and greatest version of
WordPress!

5.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:State_of_Codex#New_Articles.2C_New_Sections.2C_New_Codex.3F
also outlines some of the choices.

I simply use the FF toolbar codex search engine. There's one for codex, one 
for support. Does that make sense?

Problem: Is a banner of this sort to be used within sections of a page,
or are we branching pages off to represent a new version if some change
occurs which causes the documentation to be out of date? We've all seen
features appear (or for a few template tag params, start to work) when
a new minor version is released. I'm not certain I understand how this
is expected to work in those cases.

> We also need to make a decision about using v1.6 or 1.5 (with v or

Software documentation usually just references supported versions this
way:

	Applies to: 1.5.1, 1.5.1.x, 1.6

Naturally, this would be a very (very) difficult activity to maintain
on Codex (i.e. through MediaWiki). Certainly wouldn't work as a stub.

Anyway, I was lead to believe early on that it was decided Codex would
focus on documentation for the *current* release of WordPress (hence so
little attention paid to 1.2.x). Do plans for 1.5(.x) banners reverse
this?

As much as we like to, we can't expect everyone to be using Firefox.

This is pretty bad, I would much prefer we don't use these. If we need 
archives of old documentation, we can point to Podz' PDFs. Major 
releases aren't often enough (about 2 a year) to warrant some confusing 
version scheme.

I know a few aren't bang up to date, but 'old' ? :p

There is a huge stack to do, and when I get time I'll try and put a dent 
in that. There has been a suggestion in the forums that I also produce 
them as CHM files. That's a No. I've nothing against CHM files, but I 
have not got the time to do more and then I would end up with two 
systems to keep up to date, and with people downloading every last KB 
'just in case'. Even I have to say No at some point. Not that the door 
isn't open to someone else taking that on :)

I've had zero feedback (literally) on 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_a_PDF so if you do feel like 
helping, that would be really really good.

As for adding what's what to PDF's - they are all dated anyway. As the 
download page gets updated, the downloads from there will carry the date 
of publication. Older PDF's can be archived and linked to again by date. 
I don't want to start fiddling with banner, graphics or anything else.

Couldn't this be automated? It'd be easy to have a script sitting on a
server somewhere that runs as a cronjob, say once every three days or
something. It would grab articles from the codex, compare them against
a local cache and use PHP's PDFlib [1,2] to create the PDFs if they've
changed.

Yes / No.
While I have no clue (yet) as to setting that up, the end result would 
have all the TOCS in, all the [edit] links and other misc links that 
would not apply. Images would also be messed up. There was a large 
amount of editing I had to do to ensure that presentation was not as 
ugly as it would have been. My guess is that people want the slightly 
more attractive look.

It's not actually the task - I've done that enough to get going from 
here. What we need is people. It's very easy to look at what we have now 
  and divide that by alphabet. Person 1 does A-D, person 2 does E-I etc 
(though T is a whole section on it's own). Then each person only has a 
few pages to watch and update.
The code which /would/ be nice is the downloading code - if that could 
query the file / date and that was used to help people decide what had 
been updated. I would give my ftp details for the ISP space to any 
trusted helpers, and then the page in my guides would update itself. I 
think that's wishlist stuff though :)
Because of Codex going into that state of suspended animation, a backlog 
of work built up, but a glance at the Recent Changes does not show the 
real picture of changes - it's less than that.

Matt did mention SVN at one point, but Tortoise is something that 
whenever I open it to look at, something far more appealing is need to 
be done right then :)

It's been bugging me for some time that the front page of the codex 
links to a bunch of lists of other links.

It _really_ annoys me that two items on the front page, one right under 
the other, link to the same list!
Advanced_Topics links to:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Advanced_Topics

Advanced_Techniques links to
http://codex.wordpress.org/Advanced_Topics#WordPress_Advanced_Techniques

It's the same damned content!!

I'm not in a position to re-categorize anything right now.  Is there 
anything someone can do to minimize this kind of duplication?

For those of you not on the Forums list, I mentioned in a post last 
night that a good use for the sidebar would be a list of the 
international sites that are dedicated to WP. If that does not happen, 
then a sticky maybe of such.
The fact that we had a post yesterday from someone unable to find the 
Wordpress Italy site means we are lacking here.
In a followup this morning, I wondered whether in admin-footer we could 
have a link to a page where all the known international sites were. It's 
a few bytes which would mean international users could find relevant 
help with just one click. To that end, I've started 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Podz/International and I'm after 
feedback as to it's structure and any other constructive thoughts.

Ah, I sent that too soon to give a good answer to your question.

On that particular page reference to Advanced Topics - the first link is 
to the whole page. Each of the sections has an arrow after the title 
that takes it to the whole page. Because people will skip that, a 
specific link is at the top of each section.  The second link to 
#Advanced Techniques goes to that SECTION on the page. It happens, in 
this case, to be second on the list but it could be fourth or eighth on 
the front page list. Each section and major article (monitored on the 
Popular Pages) gets its own link. Advanced Topics covers a wide range of 
subjects, so if someone is only interested in Techniques (should there 
be a better name - that's worth considering) they get to the section of 
interest rather than the whole page where they have to scroll through 
the content.

This is the fun of HTML documentation where a clean table of contents is 
really hard to do.

The "WordPress in Your Language" was cleaned up from a terrible mess 
just before the Codex went down. At that time, a plea went out to the 
Polygots mailing list for people to start updating and providing 
information, which I was hoping to clean up and organize better, once 
the new info was in. Now that the Codex is back working, they are 
starting to slowly add to the information again.

The idea is to set each language in it's own section with a layout that 
follows this kind of form:

Support:
Downloads:
Themes:
Plugins:

And then with more "title links" as needed, creating a uniform link. 

I think it is brilliant to add SOLID international support forums at the 
bottom or sidebar of wordpress.org. By solid, I mean a site that has 
activity and some history, as some of these have come and gone rather 
quickly. At the least, a link to the "WordPress in Your Language" would 
be the next best thing.  Creating a separate page for support is exactly 
what was fixed when Moshu and others worked for a couple of months 
really hard to totally redo these pages. People had to click through a 
variety of segregated information to find anything, and by combining 
everything within one country name or language, they could go to one 
section to find ALL the information they needed. The last thing we need 
is to segregate the information on the Codex again.

We get a lot of people on the forum who struggle to make their question 
make sense in English, and sometimes they get ignored because the 
question and English is so hard to understand. Anyway we can help direct 
these people to help in their language is welcome.

The Codex has a list in the footer of other Codex-like support, but I 
think it is lost on the page, which is why we worked so hard to get the 
"WordPress in Your Language" updated and into the main table of contents.

Okay, I actually DO give up now on Codex. Completely.
Not a bad mood strop, just a "I'm fed of up the mysterious 'we we we we'

I firmly have believed from the beginning that inclusion of the version 
in the title or section, or highlighted in bold within an article, is 
good enough and the banners are not necessary, except on specific pages 
such as Install or Upgrade, IF the issue is directly related to version 
specifics. It makes it easier to scan down the list for "my" version. I 
personally do not want the use of the banner templates to be spread all 
over the Codex, but used lightly and with a very specific intention.

I've updated the example page accordingly, to add clarification.

Kaf, and others still thinking this way:  As long as the thinking 
continues to be "upgrade or be deprecated", implying there is little 
choice in the matter as you will be better off with upgrading, version 
specific manuals are not in the offering. One manual - all versions.

Subject: [wp-docs] PDF Codex Files
Message-ID: <43199F8B.9070805@cameraontheroad.com>

We need to discuss how and if we should include a box or obvious link 
reference to the PDF files as an alternative, or just provide a link to 
Podz' page with all of the files from the main table of contents. I 
think the PDF files should be stored on the Codex, to save bandwidth 
issues in the future if they gain popularity, also to help other 
volunteers contribute to their updating, and it would help to have some 
kind of obvious link to the document.

Now, I firmly believe that if someone wants to view a specific Codex 
article offline or in print form, saving it to their computer and/or 
having a really good print.css will replace the need for the PDF files. 
So I'm not clear on how and who will be maintaining these as some of the 
pages are constantly updated such as Themes and Plugins. Is there a team 
working on keeping these updated yet? That's a LOT of work and we need 
to share the load when we start releasing a lot of new documents for 1.6 
and having another clean up week.

Most importantly, if they are to be included, we need to highlight them 
and we need to talk about how.

I didn't say it's how I think -- it was the impression I got when I
raised the issue of what to do with 1.2.x back in February. In this
regard, Codex does not support "all versions".

Having the list of International Support Forums on the Forums or, at the 
least, a link to the WordPress in Your Language page on the Codex, is a 
great idea. I totally support it.

I wanted to make clear, my opinion about the pdf files doesn't not 
negate their value. I think they are a great addition. I also think the 
print.css file can really help with those who don't have time to wait 
for downloads or who don't want or have Adobe Reader installed. Options, 
I like the options.

My point is how to make these of value on the Codex. I think the options 
is great and having them consistently highlighted in some way would 
really help increase their value and access. How?

There are several version specific articles and information related to 
1.2 in the Codex. They are denoted by article title, section title and 
bold references. Yes, the decision was made to create a new document, 
and instead of just adding the old, starting from scratch. During 
Cleanup Week and a bit before, a major undertaking involved grabbing as 
many of the articles from the old Wiki, dedicated to 1.2, and rewriting 
and posting them on the Codex. This included setting version differences 
within the documentation. For the most part, the docs volunteers did a 
great job moving over a lot of documentation.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts/Posts_1.2 and 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Site_Architecture_v1.2 are just two of the 
examples of articles covering 1.2.  I understand that the move from 1.2 
to 1.5 version was a major step for security and other reasons, which 
deprecated 1.2. Still, there are articles, labeled and not labeled, 
which apply to 1.2.

For what it's worth: I'm all for this, with a caveat: The links being in 
native languages. After all, the point is to get people the help they 
need in the language they know best. So, I'm of the opinion that the 
links should be titled in the language they link to. Having the links in 
English may only lead to confusion. When I've hit sites that are in a 
foreign language, I look for the one word I'm sure I'll recognize: 
"English". I'm sure it would make the international community warm 
fuzzies, if they saw "WordPress help in you language" (or what ever text 
is in the links) in their native language.

We are trying to get the titles in English and their native language, 
but we are limited in several ways by browsers. Going with the character 
codes (messy but works) is the best we can do. With the Codex backup and 
running, I've emailed the Polygots group to help get this list back up 
and running.

Message-ID: <431D8ACA.4090806@cameraontheroad.com>

While the Codex was down for most of the month, there was still a lot of 
action behind the scenes.

1. The Support Forum volunteer mailing list took off and there have been 
extensive discussions on how to "do" things on the Forum. Discussions of 
policies, protections, dealing with spammers, and so on have been 
discussed and we need someone from that group to help write up some of 
these for....posterity to the Codex. I understand that rules and regs 
are something unpopular here, but think of them as guidelines for the 
Forum. Discussion archives are at 
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-forums/

2. On a similar vein, http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies was 
started and need expansion, fixing, editing, condensing, and legal 
review. Anyone interested? There are also some other policy, copyright 
and such pages that need some legalese review and fixing, which should 
be listed on the Task List.

3. Podz implemented an interesting addition to the Codex by providing 
PDF versions of the articles. They are available at 
http://www.zen77857.zen.co.uk/docs/ and an example of one of the "looks" 
we may use on the Codex to highlight access to these documents may be 
found at http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Podz. Podz is working on a plan 
on how to include these in the Codex and he will need volunteers to help 
keep these maintained. Please contact him as soon as possible to help 
with this neat new feature.

4. Screencasts were discussed earlier this year and are still desired 
for inclusion in the Codex. If you are still interested in participating 
and volunteering your time towards such inclusion, see 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Screencasts and leave a note on the 
discussion page. We will start putting a team together on this very soon.

5. Now that the Codex is back and running, if you were working on any 
articles, please complete them and/or let us know the status. We'd like 
to get these cleaned up and finished and into the main documentation as 
soon as possible.

6. There is still a lot to do on the Codex, so check out the 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks list and dig in.

7. Merger of Forum and Codex - The merger of the Forum and Codex 
continues. Linking in the Forum is now available with the same mediawiki 
feature of using [[WordPress Lessons]] to link to documents instead of 
the full URL. Not all links work such as [[Site Architecture 1.5]] and 
more work needs to be done to identify which work and which won't, and 
the Forums team is working on that. The docs team needs to be aware of 
these "irregularities" and take them into consideration when naming 
articles. The merger will basically put Codex "on the map" via the DOCS 
link at the top of the wordpress.org menu. The Codex will "look" like 
the wordpress.org layout, except that all of that will be changing from 
its current look to probably match the new logo. The table of contents 
will be changing to reflect a more "manual" approach and we'll let you 
know what is happening with that when we know more ourselves.

8. WordPressMU and wordpress.com - WordPressMU runs wordpress.com which 
runs on 1.6 ALPHA-DO-NOT-INSTALL. This means that it is a constantly 
changing look and feature version. Documentation on MU will soon be 
available on the http://mu.wordpress.org site and also in the Codex. For 
the most part, it will include installation and troubleshooting 
installations, and then an article section for users, which should be 
very small since the actual control over a WordPressMU site for users is 
fairly limited to admin panels and content.

A summary article has been started at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPressMU. I've written a series of 
articles that will help understand some of what is involved and 
different between the two versions of WordPress. Some of these will be 
cleaned up and moved into the Codex. I'll list them below. For the most 
part, WordPressMU "is" WordPress 1.6, other than installation and host 
maintenance. So there is a lot of overlap. Those on the docs team who 
have wordpress.com sites can see the difference between 1.5 and 1.6 and 
should begin to study the surface elements and think about articles that 
will enhance or replace the Administration Panels articles for the new 
look and features.

For now, other than the current summary and a few articles on using the 
admin panels, designing Themes for WordPressMU (will be posted within a 
few days), and articles such as the needs-editing 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Customizing_The_Content as this 
is the most control MU users will have over their site.

CAUTION: Remember, 1.6 Alpha is changing constantly and currently is in 
a lot of transition - to say it nicely. Avoid screenshots or extensive 
"conclusions" as they might be different tomorrow. Still, we need to 
start on the documentation, so start thinking about it.

Here are some articles discussing the differences and related documentation:

http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/11/adding-technorati-tags-to-wordpressmu-sites/

If you are interested in writing about 1.6 and MU, please let us know so 
we can put a good team together for the first documents. Soon, we will 
need extensive documentation on features and plugins related to 1.6 and 
more development and advanced level docs, so we need some lists, ideas, 
and brainstorming on what is needed and who is willing to do it.

9. The next couple of months will be really busy for the Forum and 
Codex. With wordpress.com and other WordPressMU sites popping up as part 
of the fanfare, people have already started coming to the Forum and 
Codex for help. For the most part, the help they need is there. The 
Forum software is being upgraded and improved with many volunteer 
requested changes, and the Codex is slowly starting to improve, too. 
There is now a TOC menu of the main areas of interest in the sidebar.

There is an extensive list of requested changes, fixes, and improvements 
at http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:State_of_Codex that hopefully will 
get attention and action soon. The search for the Codex is now driven by 
Yahoo, and the Codex is now hosted by Yahoo, which saves on cost and 
wear and tear. There are a lot of requests to add improved functionality 
to the search capabilities, such as options to limit the search to Forum 
or Codex, and we hope they will be implemented soon. If you have 
suggestions, please share them.

10. Thanks again to everyone who hung in there during the recent 
problems with the Codex. Everything seems to be back working and we need 
to get to work again and updating and adding new documentation. Thanks 
for all your efforts and patience.

Lorelle and the mysterious "we" of the documentation team who fed me all 
of this information to summarize. ;-)

This is the followup to Lorelle's email to the list, and it's something 
we've discussed between us.

The goal:
- for WP users to be able to download those parts of Codex that they 
wish to read offline.
- for this project to be maintained in such a way as to not be dependent 
on any one person or any single location (outside of wp.org)


The plan:

1. Recruit a team for pdf document maintenance. A minimum of 2, 
preferably 4, people are needed.
- each person takes on a designated range of Codex pages
- The Codex page range would be by TOC section, such as WordPress 
Lessons, Development Documentation, About WordPress, etc.

2. Each person would monitor the documents within their section and when 
changes are made, they will create a new PDF file.

3. The PDF file will be uploaded to the agreed upon web space.
- Podz will provide this. It will probably be ISP space as this is html
only (no code support). Other web space may be considered. The people
with access to this web space need to be well trusted and vetted and 
Podz will monitor the web space regularly.
- The web space address will also act as a backup location should the 
main location become unavailable.

4. At a set time, a cron script on wordpress.org will copy over only 
those files which have changed (date stamp being the key). This allows 
Matt to maintain the security of wp.org

5. The download page on wordpress.org will show the title of each file 
along with the last modified date.

6. Should the team begin to produce the docs in any other format, the
same procedure can be done.

7. Anyone is free to copy the files and host them elsewhere, but
no-one will be allowed download access to the download and backup web 
space location. (Right now the location is both known and the directory 
open. This would change. I see this as stopping others hotlinking to the 
files. I have no tracking I can use there).


What's needed:
- People.
If you want to help and haven't got Open Office I'll burn to CD and send 
it to you.
The more people that say Yes, the more the work is spread. It really 
isn't a difficult task.

Archiving:
- Would have to be done manually, but I think that's doable.

Volunteers appreciated !!

Consider me a volunteer. I'll look into setting up openoffice on one of my 
machines. I'd prefer either the Template Tags or a themes/theme development 
section as those are the areas I'm most familiar with. I've wanted to assist 
with the codex, but for a variety of reasons, haven't, probably won't, but 
this sorta bridges that gap.

Wonderful !!
And as for what you'd like to grab - you decide and then as others join 
we can divide up the rest.

Don't forget you'll need to download the Beta version of OO - the 
current release does not support url embedding.

And the codex page is there to be used / changed etc too.

In the interest in having our volunteer's time spent as productively as 
possible, it would probably be worth sending a message to the wiki-tech 
list to see how much of this we could automate:

The less manual intervention needed the more we can focus on the content.

I've been pondering, and I'm going to agree and disagree :)
If I read 'less manual intervention' as being more people helping 
therefore the task reduces, that's good.
Automation though .....hmm.... not sure. If we have a program doing 
this, then it will do it blindly. But people will automatically turn 
into editors, spotting typos, info which has been superceded or could be 
added to and the overall task remains a human one.

So ... where were those hands up to volunteer ?
It's meetup tonight so I'll mention the need for helping hands there 
with a hope to formally starting this by next meetup  ? Good / not-so ?
Improvements ?

Now, don't everyone race, but on the Polygots mailing list, someone 
offered this link http://people.w3.org/rishida/names/languages.html to 
the native language names for languages. WOW.

This is the thing that we need to get the native language spellings into 
WordPress in Your Language and any list on the Forum.

http://developers.mimer.com/features/unicode/tailorings.htm has the 
unicode codes to create the letters in the source code of the page. So 
that might help with some of the languages which don't register the 
letter characters on the Codex and Forum. Chinese, Japanese, and other 
character codes are going to be a challenge.

If you are really into helping this happen, please sign up for the 
Polygots mailing list and here are some other resources that might help.

I believe Lorelle was in charge of preparing these?  Her evacuation due 
to Katrina likely threw the schedule off.

Subject: [wp-docs] Filling Holes in the Codex
Message-ID: <432044A9.8060302@cameraontheroad.com>

The amount of work done on the Codex in the past few months is amazing. 
But there is still a lot of work to do.

In the WordPress Meetup yesterday, a tentative decision was made to 
generate a downloadable PDF file of the entire Codex on a regular 
schedule during the year. This would provide a single file document of 
the Codex ready for people to download and use, to print out at their 
leisure offline.

The details on making that happen are being investigated but we need to 
prepare for this to happen by making the Codex be the best online manual 
for WordPress users and that starts with an attempt to provide complete 
information.

We have some holes in the documentation that need filling. Here are some 
from the Codex:Task things to do list, but what other gaps do you all 
see that need to be filled?

specfic how to article for those using English and a second language or 
occassional use of non-english characters in WordPress posts
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Display_WordPress_Posts_on_Non-WordPress_Site

These need to be done (check the list to see if someone has already 
signed up and if they have, contact them and find out the status and if 
they need help). But what else needs to be done to help the WordPress user?

Think about how you first setup WordPress and started using it. I took 
notes while setting up my wordpress.com site to remember what I did the 
first time that I wouldn't do again, just to remember. Go through the 
process of how you use WordPress that others might want to know. Did you 
do something special with the loop and includes? What are the elements 
you see on many websites that might need some explaining for WordPress 
users?

So what is missing?

What?! Why reinvent the wheel? I thought a very logical, concept had been 
introduced to providing downloadable, printable docs. Why one file? How big 
would that be? How much more difficult will that be to keep updated? I'm 
very confused...

Matt was talking about a release cycle.
For instance, every 3 months (though no time was specified) there is a 
formal release of docs. The exact format was not discussed. This serves 
two purposes at a minimum:
- as a manual for those that like that sort of thing
- as an archive

Of course, if it serves as an archive that would seem to hint at Codex 
supporting only the current release.

I can see Matt's point. It would be good to have archived docs (point to 
consider: this may be GPL but a shedload of credits would be nice. WP 
code is GPL and there is a list of Copyright Holders in Codex. It's not 
beyond the realms of possibility for those contributors to also be 
mentioned an dhey - wouldn't you like your name in print too ?) but I 
still cannot see the point of a single download. I still think it is 
wasteful and certainly would stress most machines to open while also 
having a browser running (we cannot assume that users will have solid 
hardware).
But then maybe the full downloaded zip is actually a multitude of the 
small files ?

If the date is set and aimed for publicly (and I mean very widely 
announced) for when last submissions are in then do whatever it is to 
create the docs. If that is a good, proven script then lock codex, let 
it run and unlock. If it us, then we divide the task and go for it.

So the docs can continue to be updated - we just set targets for 
publishing, but we MUST adopt an approach by which even incomplete 
sections are published.

I think it can work - but I very strongly feel that contributors names 
should be part of the package. And I know this will get struck out too.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Foreign_Language_Characters -

There is nothing to write about because usually a user doesn't have to
do anything to have correctly displayed text in posts (or Pages) in
different languages. My keyboard is set up for 4 languages and in the
same sentence (or even the same word) I can switch from one language
to another and it always will be displayed correctly - while the admin
interface is all in English.

Possible problems - and 95% of the questions in the forum are about
this - can occur when a user is editing the template files, usually
the sidebar.php, in a text editor that doesn't have utf-8 support.

Another possible source for troubles might be MySQL - see this post
with the solution in the forum:

Well, Katrina may have thrown them off but the last two or three batches 
sent to Matt didn't get published. I was getting ready to ask what was 
going on when we had to evacuate. They are literally pulled from 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:TOC_Featured_Articles.  So grab them as

Message-ID: <432D69FB.80905@tamba2.org.uk>

I posted this to my User page:
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Podz
"I suggest that a new page be created Codex Copyright Holders.
Contributors to Codex can then be formally acknowledged. Everything is 
still GPL - just like the code - and there is no distinction between 
then between coders and contributors. --Podz 15:59, 15 Sep 2005 (GMT) "

Above that is a few more lines.
There has been no real reaction - or help.

I have just noticed that on the page 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Test_Driving_WordPress there are 4 stubs at 
the bottom.
{{stub}}
{{copyright}}
{{installation}}
{{advanced topics}}
spot the new one ? ...... and the stub for {{copyright}} is
Content is available under $1.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template:Copyright

Would someone like to enlighten everyone as to what copyright terms will 
be used, who will decide and whether or not there will be a page that 
lists the name of those who have contributed to Codex ? Or do coders 
have one rule and contributors another ? And simply saying "GPL" is NOT 
an answer.

In the long term, I think the best solution is to make it clear that all 
contributions to the Codex -- and to the code in WordPress -- explicitly 
transfers copyright of said contribution to WordPress, Inc.  WPI should 
be the sole copyright keeper, so that a single entity can pursue violations.

The Free Software Foundation requests that Free Software developers 
transfer the copyright of their projects to the FSF, so that the FSF can 
bring its weight to bear in enforcement issues.

If the consensus is that transfer of copyright is undesirable, then 
everyone should "sign" the page I linked above.  And we'll have to go 
back through page histories to add the names of people who have moved on.

I have started adding people to that page.
I am using the user list, clicking on all the blue links, checking that 
something has made it out of a user page and then adding them.
Not perfect, but right now it's the best I can think of.
I'm also adding them in alpha order because it's going to be a lot 
easier to keep track of people that way.

Add to that page manually has got to be a monumental waste of time and will
never be accurate.  You're depending on the accuracy of the Codex files and
I've seen glaring holes where logs and such have been lost.  It will also
need updating every darn day!

Why the 'uproar'?  Isn't GPL good enough?  Podz, you've proved that anyone,
anytime, can just make a copy of the Codex info.  If someone doesn't want to
copy from Codex then they can copy from your files...

If someone takes Codex and makes a book, that can only be great for
WordPress!  In fact, that effort probably should be encouraged rather than
discouraged.

I would rather have names there than none.

True, but I didn't do it to make a profit or make a book - I did it 
precisely to prevent that happening.

Only if everyone who has contributed is cool with that.

What I am completely failing to understand here is that people who screw 
with WP code get all manner of crap rained down on them. WP is GPL yet 
when a different version was released (around 1.2 time) certain people 
were more than displeased about it.

Codex and the docs have put WordPress where it is as much as anything 
else - and it seems that no-one wants to protect it in the same way the 
code is.

There's an uproar when someone appropriates the WordPress name. [1]
There's an uproar when someone releases non-free plugins [2] or themes [3].

These are all justifiable, because the contributions of many are being 
used without attribution, and oftentimes without making the source of 
the new theme or plugin available, as required by the terms of the GPL.

Yet the attitude coming from many regarding the Codex -- many who have 
not contributed as much to the Codex -- seems to be "sure, take it, we 
don't care."

Podz is defending the position that we _DO_ care.  Writing docs is hard. 
  A lot of effort went into making the Codex the resource that it is. 
The contributors deserve every bit as much credit as the person who 
submits an elegant piece of code to solve some problem inside WordPress.

Further, it would be a real slap in the face to all the volunteer effort 
if someone distilled the Codex, published a book, and provided no links 
to the Codex, nor made the contents of the book available free of charge 
to others for further improvement (or for integration back into the Codex).

If someone takes the time and effort to distill the Codex into a book, I 
say bully for them!  I've thought about it.  It's not an easy task, but 
it's also not impossible.  But how can WordPress and the Codex 
contributors effectively assert the copyright of their work if there is 
no explicit copyright statement on the Codex?  What if, instead of 
distilling the Codex, someone made an exact copy and sold it, with no 
indication that the contents were in fact authored by someone else, or 
that the same content is available free at the Codex?

This all gets a little murky, just as it does for the code. We want to 
share the information; but we want to make sure we're not making 
Herculean efforts just so someone else can waltz in and profit from our 
work.

The idea was raised recently (the last #meetup, I think?) that the docs 
should be licensed under the same terms as WordPress itself.  But since 
we're not actually bundling the Codex with the WordPress source, I 
question that mandate.  I'm personally not keen on the GFDL [4], because 
it's not exactly free; but the GFDL is probably better suited to written 
texts that may live as dead-tree books (which is the complaint against 
GPL for books: how does one properly release the "source"?).

Given the problems of the GFDL, and the ambiguity of the GPL for things 
that aren't programs, we might want to consider a CC license, like 
CC-NC-SA.  We can't reasonaly use CC-BY because we'd then require 
everyone using the Codex elsewhere to include a complete list of 
copyright holders, which may be impractical.  A NC-SA license can be 
used in commercial activities if permission is granted from the 
copyright holders.  I think it's reasonable to ask someone to contact 
all the copyright holders for a given page (as defined by its edit 
history) if the contents of that page are to be used in a commercial 
endeavour.

Or, again, transfer the copyright to WordPress, Inc. (or the Free 
Software Foundation), so that that entity can grant exceptions to the NC 
clause, as they see fit.

Since Podz has already 'made a copy of Codex' it seems the discussion is

There is a copyright statement that I forged the last time something like 
this came up - we thought it'd be a good idea to use the GPL for Codex 
content too.


Isn't this the copyright statement?

That's the one I put in place.

> almost a moot point. Is his copy of Codex legal or illegal?


It is perfectly legal and valid.

All content on the Codex should be available freely, as this knowledge 
belongs in the domain of the collective commons. Adaptation of the 
information for a different purpose should be welcome as well.
I have pretty much stopped contributing effectively due to personal 
pressures, and should it be that the stuff I contributed is irrevocably 
mine, it would be funny if I wanted it all back - don't you think?

The hours I put into working on the documentation were justified (by me - to 
myself) by the thought that what I was doing was not ephemeral, or 
temporary, and that a little effort on my part will go a long way, with the 
contributions of others.

Really, I don't know why re-use of documentation is such a big issue -- look 
to the developers, who release their code out in the wild - to be used as 
seens fit - for other to profit, if you will.

<personal opinion>
Knowledge is only valuable when it is shared "freely".
If someone wants to make a buck out of it, and not share the proceeds, then 
little can be said except that it is no model behavior.
</personal opinion>

Personal contributions that folks dont want to share freely do not belong in 
a public information resource. 
Moot Point: It is not just you that contribute to the codex - the codex 
contributes towards amplifying your effort too. If you 
guide/howto/faq/whatever existed outside of the codex, in isolation - it 
would be much less useful. It is a symbiotic relationship. The price you pay 
to ensure a greater impact for your work is that it will be reshaped and 
reused, probably for profit.

So would the coders mind if I deleted the page in Codex ?

And if that is different, why is a docs list not ?

I personally don't care.  You can add a Documentation Copyright Holders
if you want.  Notice that the names of copyright holders aren't in the
actual code itself.

Each contributor holds copyright on their contributions.   The
contributor agrees to license under the GPL whenever contributing to
Codex.

Podz, I think the whole thing with the {{ copyright }} tag has been fixed 
now. The template tag was improperly setup and I have edited it now. So it 
serves the intended purpose now.

One can use it as follows:

inserting:
{{copyright|GPL}}

Will yield:
Content is available under the GPL.

in the rendered page, and 
{{copyright|CC-NA}}
Will yield:
Content is available under the CC-NA.

for example.

Feel free to edit the template tag, and make it say a constant
"Content is available under the terms of the GPL." if you like.

Carthik.

Good that there could be some archive of Codex contents.

One big file would have some good sides:
- all information in same package
- just one file to download
- easier to print whole documentation (but who wants that?)

But as you said, there are some bad sides (in big file):
- one big file could make opening and reading much slower
- if/when somebody wants just several parts he is required to
  get it all --> unnecessary use of network bandwidth
- printing of just part of the documentation could be harder
  for some people (that don't know how to use print dialog;)

I think it could be better move to provide:
- individual files of different sections of Codex
  (instead of one big massive file)
- big zip file full of those smaller .pdf files
- possibility to download just few of .pdf files
  without need to unpack zip files

Question is that what is good size of part of documentation?

That's what happens when Lorelle is stupid tired and trying to catch up

I asked the wp-hackers list about this, as it seems
that themes can now add their own functions (plugins)
adding a functions.php file to the theme. I think this
is slated for 1.6, but I'm not sure if it'll come in
sooner. You can see the discussion about it here:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-September/002701.html

I was wondering if this has been added to the codex at
all, because if it hasn't I thought I could write
something up.

1. No it hasn't been added to Codex, because
2. It is a feature slated for 1.6, and so
3. Feel free to write something up, but it should not be
made part of the regular documentation yet.

I and others are aware of this and we're waiting for some final 
decisions about how this is to work before committing it to the Codex. 
It's an exciting feature, but one that has a lot of scary possibilities 
wrapped into it. We'll get it going, and if you want to start on digging 
into some of it on an article under your user name on the Codex, go 
ahead, but make sure you are familiar with all the ins and outs of the 
theory so we don't invite evil to slip in through the back door. ;-)

Thanks!

Just a suggestion, I know there's a plugin currently out there that provides 
all these features now. If the article were written around that plugin, then 
once 1.6 is released, and the full extent of those features are solidified, 
the article could be adapted.

The pros and cons of plugins built into Themes is being discussed on 
http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-hackers right now. I'd 
like to see that conversation and the concerns it poses play out so we 
don't:

1) Jump the gun and then have to pull back.
2) Put out information that could pose a security risk to users.
3) Make sure all the hooks and elements are settled in the core programming.
4) Push users into rushing to grab Alpha before it ripens. ;-)

The role of customization of Themes, Plugins and other accessories via 
WordPressMU is a very critical part of its growth and success. We need 
to tackle this, but I want to see what the developers come up with. Keep 
an eye on it or jump into the conversation.

Yes, the ability to have some form of customizability will really help 
wordpress.com. I'm not talking customizability down to the nano-spec but 
the ability to add polling, most recent comments, most popular posts, 
and a lot of the popular plugins. To be able to change the header to a 
design of your own. Little things. Without some of this flexibility and 
"feeling" like the user can add features to "make it their own", 
enthusiasm may wane. This ability is already in the works, so I say 
continue forward.

Personally, I'd absolutely love to do away with the blogroll on my 
wordpress.com site and replace it with most recent or most popular posts 
to increase navigation on my site. I link to plenty of folks within my 
posts, so I want better navigation to keep folks visiting longer. A 
couple of buttons to click would take away the blogroll and add most 
popular posts. I like it! ;-)

This whole thread should be renamed. They are not plugins, its a place
to load functions to seperate code from presentation, and it is also
loaded earlier so themes may optionally hook into the admin. Let's not
document anything with this misconception and reduce the possiblity
for abuse.

I think we need to get things clarified.
Are we a docs list for wordpress ? wpmu ? The emerging hybrid ? 
wordpress.com ? Or all things to all people.

It is going to get very very confusing - and people will simply drop off 
lists that do not seem to be pertinent.

It would help if we didn't use phrase "theme plugins".

The reason for some doing so possibly lies with Ryan's announcement
that when a theme has a functions.php it will be loaded after the
plugins. And though the idea is to offer some plugin-like access to
the API hooks and whatnot, the term 'plugins' used for this is just
going to confuse people.

They're theme-specific functions. Let's call them that.

At this weeks #meetup, I proposed that the copyright ownership of Codex

This was discussed at #meetup, but unfortunately Matt was not present. 
Because it is not entirely clear where we currently stand or what indeed 
the FSF can offer, I volunteered to get some information.

I have just emailed them with some brief info so I can hopefully get 
pointed to the right people.

What I need from YOU is a list of any and every concern you have now, or 
might have, or need to know about the FSF. I do not want someone to come 
along in the future, take Codex and do something with it that we can 
then do nothing about. WP has no resources, no experience in these 
things, so we need information and possibly the help of the FSF (if they 
take us - they may have other options).

But what I need to things to ask them. We cannot make such a decision 
without having a lot of facts - and bear in mind too that this exercise 
may show what rights / protections we do already have - and the audience 
that needs satisfying about such a move is reading this email :)

Please send issues to this list, or privately.

Every email I send / receive will be made public in it's entirety.

As I see it, someone could wander along, take a good long look at codex, 
it's licence and protections and then do something that would have us 
all yelling about that act being unfair, exploitative etc.
I'd rather we closed the stable door first, and to do that, we need 
information.

Every single contributor to the Codex thus far must do a copyright
assignment to the FSF.  Only they can grant their copyright to someone
else.

For future contributions, you can require that contributors fill out a
copyright assignment.  This can be very tedious and often requires the
use of fax machines.

For example,

http://www.openoffice.org/FAQs/faq-licensing.html#jcaa


Most open source projects don't bother with copyright assignment.  It
often becomes a barrier to contribution.

This would have been something better to do when it started, making the
members that make articles agree that their words would be copyright by
WordPress. I will have to keep this in mind next time I start something
public.

Podz, the only way someone can really exploit the codex is to take parts 
of it and print them under a non-gpl license, yeah? In which case the 
people who wrote the parts in question have a copyright issue at hand. I 
understand that whoever is in this position might not have the resources 
to sue a large publisher, but in that case, the infamy that comes from 
ripping off WordPress will do the publisher far more harm than good.

Now, if this situation were to arise, say, we'd need to know who has 
copyright over the articles, yup? Hence information. Well. Ask every 
user to supply a way to get in touch with them on their user page 
(website, email, etc), and figure it out through the revision history.

I know that you've been in search of a 'codex copyright holders' list. 
If you really want, I can explore the options that we have to figure out 
who has made more than 10 or so revisions on the WP articles and 
automagically generate the copyright holders list from that. It might 
require a dump of some parts of the codex db though. The upside is that 
it'll be far more accurate than the 'code copyright holders' list 
because (I assume) that one is updated manually, not sure by whom or 
under what criteria (is everyone who has submitted a nontrivial patch 
that got used listed there?)

It may be interesting to note (and I mentioned this in the meetup, but
I'm going to throw it in here, too, just so we can keep other options
in mind) that Drupal leaves the Copyright of their docs in the
contributor's hand but allows them to be used in accordance with CC's
Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0.

I cannot believe that a project such as WordPress is going to settle for 
what I can only see as a fudge.
Copyrights all over the place, attributions for some work, attributions 
missing for other work, completely unclear as to who should do what when 
and how. Maybe if those people who have given the most time and energy 
into Codex were actually consulted ? It's /their/ work.

I'll apologise to the FSF for wasting their time with my enquiry email.

That's open source.  This is an open source project.  I'm failing to see
the problem.  The documentation should be as free as the code.  It
currently is because it is licensed under the GPL.  The problem with
that is...?

What kind of attribution do you want?  Codex is far better attributed
than the source code.  Each Codex contributor commits his own changes.
Every freakin' line in the Codex is attributed giving excellent
copyright traceability.

Are you expecting fame and reward?  I've contributed a heaping shitload
of time to open source projects over the last decade and in that time
one person bought me something off my wishlist and Nuclear Moose
interviewed me.  Oh, and I received an endless stream of pissy and petty
emails from people who think they own me when they use what I give them
for free.  I was also constantly implicated in the conspiracy theories
of raving idiots and mired in the politics of those who find evidence of
elitism in every damn decision and make calls for class struggle against
the oppressive devs with each breath.  Such is the way it is.  Do this
as a hobby with no expectation of getting anything out of it or do
something else and save yourself the disappointment.

Anyway, back to work.

Ryan

There is a difference between "free to use under the terms of the GPL" 
and "copyright violation".  If someone took the WordPress code and made 
a closed, for-pay product, would you say "Oh well, them's the breaks"? 
I doubt it, because that is in violation of the license.  Moreover, it 
infringed your copyright interests in the work.

Yes, we can trace the copyright of each edit, assuming that no data has 
been lost from the MediaWiki database.  That is one aspect of the issue 
at hand.

The other aspect is copyright enforcement.  If someone plagarizes a 
document I've written on the Codex word-for-word and publishes it in a 
for-pay print publication, it is my responsibility, as the copyright 
holder, to bring action.  I can't do much of that, for lack of time and 
funds.  Should I stop contributing to the Codex?  Or should I stop 
bothering to license my work?  Or should I simply revoke any copyright 
interest in my contributions?

If copyright is transferred to a single entity, that entity can bring 
its resources to bear in any enforcement that may be necessary.  This 
better protects the contributions of individuals, as well as better 
protecting the project as a whole.

I'm truly sorry to hear that Free Software development has been such a 
bother for you.

But I think you'll agree that your position as a major contributor to a 
popular Free Software project has quite possibly opened a few doors for 
you that might not have opened otherwise.  You certainly have "name 
recognition" in many circles, and a body of work at which you can point 
in job interviews, other Free Software project discussions, etc etc.

The folks contributing documentation don't get even that intangible 
reward.  Docs are every bit as thankless as writing code, and _far_ less 
likely to generate wishlist purchases or Paypal donations.  I don't 
think there's anything wrong at all with some visible attribution in the 
Codex so that the contributors can generate for themselves the same kind 
of documented record as the developers enjoy.  This may help the 
documentors in job interviews, other Free Software projects, etc.

It's clear to me that this issue is important to some, and completely 
unimportant to others.  I don't see why a fuss is being made by those to 
whom it is unimportant.  Were this discussion happening on the hackers 
list about some hot new feature (say, WYSIWYG posting...), the folks for 
whom it was a passionate issue would trump the folks who don't care.

Or is WordPress, in fact, not an open development project, but just Matt 
and Ryan; and all of us lowly contirbutors need to defer to your 
preferences on everything?

1. This is nothing to do with me or my contributions.

2. This is everything to do with protecting the copyrights that belong 
to each and every contributor.

3. Right now, all that's rattled out - by people who have not given 
largely to Codex - is the phrase "It's GPL". The people who actually 
have done the work are not being consulted about their copyright. 
Doesn't that strike you as odd ?

4. This is about taking action now so that the work is protected. From
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html -"be sure to find out who 
the copyright holders of the software are before reporting a violation." 
and yet when I start to create a page of all the copyright holders, I 
get told it is a waste of time. Please do explain WHY that is a waste of 
time given that it would be needed.

5. The Codex still does not say that copyright is retained by the 
author. It does not say what rights the author may or may not have. It 
does not say who may or may not make any judgements about copyright, 
publishing, income generation etc. Don't you think it should ? It 
doesn't matter one bit that YOU might know - it should be there in clear 
language for all to see and understand before they start typing

6. This is not about fame and reward AT ALL. My contributions to Codex 
are way way less than a great many people, but that does not diminish 
the fact that I have the right to express what I want on this issue nor 
does it stop me looking at the bigger picture and wondering just what is 
going on. that is not a conspiracy theory, merely that right now this 
situation is just begging to be exploited given the condition it is in.

7. If this thread were about code in the Hackers list I'd be able to 
feel the heat from here.

8. It's a mess. It needs sorting out and the voices that actually matter 
are those people that have contributed - and surely everyone is equal 
there ? Or are we ? And if we are not, just say so.

I've contributed a tiny bit to the codex, and I'm not
too worried about it. If I have a say in this, I'd say
leave it as-is. If that isn't an option, I'd say do
the same thing that Wikipedia does and leave it at
that. I'm sure they've put a lot of thought into these issues.

Seriously Podz, tell us what you *really* feel. ;)
Back to that in a sec:

Jenna - "the voices that actually matter are those people that have
contributed" - as the authors of the content (what ever part they have
contributed) they are the inherent copyright holders of said content.
As such, *they* are the ones who should be able to dictate what happens
to that content. Unless they explicity release it, someone else cannot
come along and publish it as thier own work. Well, they aren't supposed
to at any rate. The problem lies in the ambiguity of the ownership of
Codex content. It isn't clear what rights the authors have.

Actualy, it has everything to do with you and your contributions, just
as it has everything to do with me and my contributions. That's the
point of this isn't it?

Which I'll admit, I never thought about until it was brought up. How
many others out there are in the same boat? And what to do about those
that have come and gone over time?

When I make a posting to a forum, to which includes code, that post
becomes property of the forum owners. In fact, I know of one site
(owned by a major conglomerate) that even specifies right in their
Acceptable USe Policy that by posting, you transfer ownership of
content and copyright to the company. And that they can do what ever
they want with it, w/o compensation to you. In all honesty, I had
(mistakenly it seems) assumed the same kind of deal here. I had just
assumed that ownership was inherently transfered. Guess not.

My only thought on this is the content that has multiple authors.
Example, Podz, you come in and add a bunch of stuff to a page, then I
come in and make some changes. Who owns it now? Me, or you?

I'd say we're all equal... 
And I'd like to know what's up too.

Because the minute you write it, it'll be out of date. It'd be much 
easier to just look at the revision history for a page, IF such a case 
were to occur which I have never heard of.

Would it calm people's mind if we had one of those heavy TOS agreements 
that says "everything you produce on this website is owned by X"? Lots 
of commercial websites like Yahoo have something similar. That said, 
I've never liked them.

ALL work is in that position.

The FSF often helps pursue violators on behalf of a project even if that
project did not do copyright assignment.  The GPL has never had to go to
court.  The matter is usually settled long before that with just a
little pressure from the copyright holders along with the help of
various watchdog agencies.


"3. Right now, all that's rattled out - by people who have not given 
largely to Codex - is the phrase "It's GPL". The people who actually 
have done the work are not being consulted about their copyright. 
Doesn't that strike you as odd ?"

You retain your copyright and agree to license to others under the terms
of the GPL.  Period.  What consultation is required?  If they don't want
to contribute under the license that now stands over the Codex, they
shouldn't contribute.  If they don't understand the GPL, they shouldn't
contribute.  If they are overwrought with fear and doubt, they shouldn't
contribute.

If you want to relicense, have fun with that.  It's a colossal pain that
can take a year even for a small project.

"4. This is about taking action now so that the work is protected. From
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html -"be sure to find out who
the copyright holders of the software are before reporting a violation."
and yet when I start to create a page of all the copyright holders, I
get told it is a waste of time. Please do explain WHY that is a waste of
time given that it would be needed."

Create the page if it makes you feel better.

You don't need every last copyright holder to bring action.  Lorelle
alone hold lots of copyright on Codex.  She could bring action.  If
someone infringed on the WP code, they would be surely be stepping on
the toes of Matt and I.  We could take action.  But, like I said, most
infringers back down with just a little pressure.  Just giving them some
bad PR on groklaw is typically sufficient.

"5. The Codex still does not say that copyright is retained by the 
author."

See the laws for your country.  In the US and most countries you
automatically have copyright to your work and retain all rights.  You
have to explicitly grant rights to others via a device such as the GPL.

"It  does not say who may or may not make any judgements about
copyright, publishing, income generation etc. Don't you think it
should ? It doesn't matter one bit that YOU might know - it should be
there in clear language for all to see and understand before they start
typing"

Read the GPL.  It's all in there.  If someone does not understand that
they need to consult a lawyer.

"7. If this thread were about code in the Hackers list I'd be able to 
feel the heat from here."

No, most developers know how open source works.

The WP code is forked almost once a month.  Sometimes that's once a week
when people get tweaked about something on the forums or mailing list.
Someone can take the WP source, remove all references to WP, and call it
"Bob's Amazing Wonder Press" and I wouldn't care and the GPL wouldn't
care as long as the source remains open.

I think it makes sense that the spirit of one of those heavy TOS should be
understood already without a heavy TOS. If folks understand the spirit of
that then life will be easier. If they don't it's too bad for them...

But that's me.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works
The Berne Convention is still alive - and copyrights are automatic, except
for a very few countries.

I think the basic problem is that a lot of people here are confused about
what Copyright is, what a License is, and what the difference between the
two is.

I stop here, since there is nothing I can say about the problem - which is
still not clear to me.

Why don't you go ahead and change/edit it to say so? Sounds like a good
idea.
I wonder if all the contributors are just as worried about copyright, and
more importantly licensing issues.

The GFDL, as used by Wikipedia, has some flaws.  Wikipedia's specific
use actually skirts the flaws (Wikipedia does not use invariant
sections); but the fact that license supports non-free elements is
problematic.

Further, as has been stated several times by several people,
re-licensing the current work will be a tremendous effort.  All
contributors must consent to the change.

If the GPL comment is not yet part of the new user stub, I will add it.
 That, at least, will make it clear to new participants what to expect.

Can someone with power please add the copyright link to the Codex
footer, so that every page is _clearly_ marked as GPL.

Do I detect hostility ?

I believe that users should be clearly informed of what will or could 
happen to their information.
I believe that the current page is not being open and honest. It could 
be better.

Obviously I am wrong.

I think Carthik is more advocating the do-acracy theory of Open Source
development: those who do, can.

What I'm led to believe from reading the GPL is that publishing a print 
version of Codex (which clearly qualifies as a derivative work) without 
releasing the source files required for the print run (including content 
and formatting) is a violation of the license.

If you could please make that plain in the licensing, it would be 
appreciated.

Folks,

http://codex.wordpress.org/Template:Welcome

The page has now been changed to clearly state that the COPYRIGHT is
held by each contributor. This is, and was, the case without any
statement. It is the law in almost all countries.

The page also clearly state that "by contributing you expressly agree
to... the GPL".

Please note that GPL is not copyright, and that copyright is not GPL.
The GPL is a licence. It specifies what other people can and cannot do
with your work. But note that The GPL requires a copyright holder in
order to be enforceable.

As to the myth about "publishing/releasing/distributing without
releasing the source files... is a violation" the GPL has this to say:

If you do publish the GPL product you must
   "Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code"

and

"If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, "

Note also that if someone does publish a book derived from the
contents of the Codex, pointing to the codex as the "source code" is
not good enough. They must make their own copy and provide that on
request.

The whole of the GPL is here http://codex.wordpress.org/GPL It is
really not too long to read nor too hard to understand.

Ryan's response on another thread
(http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-September/000998.html)
whilst sounding rather exasperated, was factually correct.

I think it would be a nice touch for someone with the appropriate
access to add a simple link to the common footer. But it isn't
required.

Is everyone satisfied yet?


Mike

Yes, I did that.  If it is the default in almost all countries, then
there's no harm in making it explictly obvious to people who may be
unfamiliar with that default.

> The page also clearly state that "by contributing you expressly agree

 think the ellipses is misleading.  What I wrote in full:
"by contributing you <strong>expressly</strong> agree to make your

If we're going to plaster the GPL on the pages, we need to make it clear
that the new contributor is adding their work fully cognizant that it
will be licensed as such.

To me, it's unfair to expect the contributor to already be familiar with
the GPL, and what it permits and forbids.

The question I have is what constitutes "source" for a published book?
Would postscript files of the imposed pages suffice?

Ryan said
"You retain your copyright and agree to license to others under the
terms of the GPL.  Period.  What consultation is required?  If they
don't want to contribute under the license that now stands over the
Codex, they shouldn't contribute.  If they don't understand the GPL,
they shouldn't contribute.  If they are overwrought with fear and doubt,
they shouldn't contribute."

But prior to today we were not making much of an effort to make it clear
to new participants that they were, in fact, agreeing to license their
contributions under the GPL.  It was an implicit understanding at best.
 _WE_ might have known it, but to a new contributor it was very likely
non-obvious.

If they didn't know that was the license -- since there is NO license
declaration anywhere obvious on most documentation pages -- how can we
expect them to abstain from contributing?

> Is everyone satisfied yet?

I don't understand why this is such a polarized issue.  Some folks are
expressing a concern, and working to make the Codex a better place in a
way that makes sense to them.  None of these people are attorneys, and
few of them have dealt with the nitty-gritty of licensing minutae
before.  Those that disagree have been outright _hostile_ in their
reactions.  Why all the negativity?  Why not a collaborative effort to
solve a problem?  Why not a little patience and dialogue, instead of
stand-offish declaratory statements (regardless of how factually correct
such statements may be).

I can infer a few reasons.

If someone gets asked "Hey, could you add that to Codex ?" then we 
cannot and should not assume a level of knowledge about the legal 
technicalities. Those who DO know should have made it clear in as many 
places as reasonably possible not just that the GPL was involved but to 
try and be sure that people know - indicating outside sources that are 
known good ones would be useful.
As it stands, I felt that people were adding to Codex without due 
consideration of what may happen (or be happening) to their freely given 
work, so I wanted those holes closing by educating people.

I am astonished that the goal of providing information to people has 
been given the very negative reception it has.

I am also concerned by the silence of certain people, but that silence 
speaks volumes.

It would suffice no more than object code would suffice as source code 
for a compiled executable.  It wouldn't, because you can't compile 
subsequent derivative works - the whole purpose of the GPL - from 
postscript.

Whatever source files are compiled to produce the postscript (Word, 
Quark, InDesign, Ventura) would be adequate.

Message-ID: <0MKp2t-1EIpWs1P2f-0007T3@mrelay.perfora.net>


Has any thought been given to documenting some of the other functions of
WP? The Template Tags are pretty well documented, as is a couple of the
non-template tags, such as those that support "the loop".
http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop

But there are others available out there. Like the ones to get comments.
I'm asking because I came across comment_excerpt() and thought about
using it in my new template. But the most I could get out of the
documentation was this: "This tag must be within The Loop, or a comment
loop." Okay, so how do I make a comment loop? Ultimately I looked at my
comments.php file to see how it's made. In there I see this code: <?php
if ( comments_open() ) : ?> Is this what gets the comments? Or are they
automaticaly retireved when the post is gotten? - as I write this, I
realize that's a conditional tag.

I'm now realizing some of what I wrote is moot, I just need to look in
the right place. But that does bring up something I noticed. include
tags and conditional tags are not on the front page, but template tags
are. Yes, I know you can get to the others from the template tage page,
but I wonder if they should also be on the front page. If some one is
looking specificaly for a cond tag, they may not think to look on the
template tags page first to get to the link (I didn't).

I suggested the GPL licensing be made clear to contributors months ago.
I've suggested that every time this thread came up.  Nobody did anything
about it.  Codex is not my house to keep in order.

Make it clear that Codex is under the GPL, give a link to the GPL, let
them read it and decide.  Don't try to interpret it for them.  We're not
lawyers.

If I recall correctly, Firas and his gang are working on or had the
idea of creating a big WP php dictionary. You may want to ask them how
that's going, unless them saying something about it was just my

Agreed, but equally I think we need to make it as easy as possible for 
them to understand. I will try and find some sites that do lay things

It probably was :)

I do remember wringing hands about the undocumentedness of hooks with 
Lorelle, Mark Jaquith, etc, and talking about possible ways to list them 
in the codex, but that's all. Mark has an initiative that starts taking 
care of that (http://wphooks.flatearth.org/)

I'm like a dog with a bone on this one.

We seem to have established that approaching the FSF is a bad thing. As 
it stands, they are having some sort of staff change so there is a 
queue, and unless things change, I will decline to pursue the matter 
with them when they reply.

But there remain unanswered issues. Now before you leap all over this 
screaming, just try and understand that all I am after is clarity. I'm 
not someone who has just popped up and started pointing fingers - I 
would hope my track record of helping shows I'm on the side of the good 
guys. This is not a personal agenda. I happen to think that Codex and 
it's license were not given due attention at the earliest time, and that 
we now have a potentially messy situation. That 'due attention' is 
no-one's fault necessarily but the last few threads here must surely 
show that all is not as well and clear-cut as it should be.
So, with that in mind, if I am not clear, please ask me to elaborate.

I write a page in Codex.
I retain copyright of that page, but I am allowing it's use under the 
terms of the GPL.
Bob comes along, takes my page, puts it in his book, credits me and the 
source and sells his book. That's fine. We are all happy.
John comes along, takes my page, puts it his book and sells it. No 
credit. No link to the source. Just my page. Who looks after my interest 
there ?

The way I see it, I'm currently on my own. We all are. We all have 
copyright over our own work, but I don't see that when I wrote anything 
that I gave my permission for someone else to look after my copyright 
interests. I don't have any chance of looking after my interests though 
do I ? So when I said that the FSF should be considered, I was not 
trying to do anything more than have a single enforceable point of 
ownership - something we do not currently have.

If I have got anything glaringly wrong here, please just tell me, but 
equally, if there really are things that need to get sorted out then 
shouldn't we start to discuss them ?

Vanity links are not comptaible with open source licenses.  The GPL 
requires that copyright headers be maintained; that's about it in terms 
of credit.  It's about the source being free.

This comes up all the time with open media (as opposed to open source) 
folks.  Open source folks have been at it for a good while and have 
tread this ground.  Advertising clauses, vanity links, and such are a no 
no.  It's about the code being free, and such links impinge freedom.  
Open source folks worry more about maintaining open distribution and 
keeping the code free. Open media folks, on the other hand, are 
preoccupied with credit.  I think there was a conference recently where 
open source and open meda folks got together to talk about these 
cultural differences.  It can sometimes be hard to get open media that 
is compatible with open source.  That's becoming a bigger problem as the 
two intertwine more.

It's up to you to protect your interests, as with anything.

That's what lawyers are for.  If you ever need one, hire one.  Get one 
who knows IP really well.  I've been in court with some completely 
clueless lawyers, who were on our side, alas.

> I don't have any chance of looking after my interests though do I ?

Of course you do.  Sue the bastards!  Enlist the various watchdog groups 
to your cause.  People successfully enforce their GPL rights all the time.

http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/enforcing-gpl.html

" As a copyright license the GPL is absolutely solid. That's why I've 
been able to enforce it dozens of times over nearly ten years, without 
ever going to court."

Understandable, but I don't think it's particularly necessary or worth 
it.  Copyright assignment tends to drive contributors off and adds 
bureaucracy.

There are several good resources that cover copyright and open source.  
I follow groklaw all the time.

So "Source: codex.wordpress.org" would suffice ?

It's a learning curve )

And that's where things fall down... because individually we cannot 
afford to. I certainly can't. Now I know that the point I made about 
writing a page was just an illustration, and that a single page wouldn't 
be worth the hassle to either steal or sue over, but it was the wider 
issue I was looking at - which is that I am on my own.

Who owns Codex ?

There are plenty of folks out there who help open source projects with 
issues like this.   Every situation has been resolved without going to 
court.  IMO, copyright assignment doesn't buy you much.  About the only 
projects that do it are one's controlled by companies who want to be 
able to release the code under multiple licenses (free and 
proprietary).  GNU also requires it for projects under their umbrella.

Matt owns Codex the site.  He's hosting it and paying the bills. The 
content is owned by each contributor.

Yes, it's not the most ideal license for documentation, but it's what 
we're stuck with, I believe.  Relicensing old content can be a pain.  
Changing the license for new content is possible. And big contributors 
like you and Lorelle could dual-license all of your existing 
contributions.  That would move a lot of the content forward to a new 
license.  It's up to ya'll.  I'm not a big contributor to Codex and 
don't really care what the license is as long as it's open.

+1. I'd like to see a discussion on the license pursued with as much 
vigour rather than this one about copyright arcana. Why was the GPL 
chosen over the CC licenses  or the GFDL?

If the powers that be just prefer it, then maybe those who disagree 
should add to their user pages another license that their copyrighted 
work can be shared under, as well as the GPL. Preferably a common one 
among such people, arrived to after discussion. It's an advantage of the 
fact that copyright was not transferred that multilicensing may occur.

The CC Attribution-Sharealike, for example. The CC folk have tailored 
the 2.5 version of their licenses to the exact situation we're 
discussing here (everyone to a wiki holds their own copyright but the 
attribution can be just to the collective wiki).

The biggest problem I see is that if someone wants to reuse the codex 
they're going to have to redistribute their work under a GPL license. A 
GPL license for a tutorial, or for a book?! We'll not just be making the 
open-access portion of the WP philosophy viral, but we'd be making a 
*bad decision* viral.

I am not a lawyer.  Anything I say should not be construed as legal advice.

Vanity links are different from attribution.  The original BSD license 
required an attribution statement to the regents of the University of 
California.  That was not a vanity link.

Source being free is not the same issue as copyright enforcement.

The GPL _does not_ give you permission to take a document I wrote and 
slap your own copyright statement on it, claiming that you authored it.

If you change one word in my document, you have created a derivative 
work.  That derivative work must _also_ be licensed under the terms of 
the GPL, so other folks can take your work, change one word, and release 
it as a derivative work.

None of that changes my copyright of the original work.  None of the 
folks downstream can assert that they are the creators of that work.  At 
most they can claim to be the creator of the derivative work.

Advertising links are a no-no for Richard Stallman, and the Free 
Software Foundation.  The Open Source Initiative is considerably more 
liberal on these issues.

Free Software is a subset of Open Source Software.

Richard Stallman thinks so, and so the Free Software Foundation thinks so.

Open source folks rightly also worry about copyright control.  The fact 
that the source is available for scrutiny and modification _does not_ 
mean that you are abandoning copyright ownership of the source you 
write.  If that were the case, WordPress would be released into the 
public domain with specific language disclaiming any copyright status.

Yes, it is, and as such the disincentive to misappropriating Codex work 
is extremely small.  A publisher could elect to republish the entire 
Codex in a for-pay book with no source release, because every individual 
contributor would need to take action against them.

Chances are, said publisher has considerably more resources to defend 
themselves than each individual contributor has to bring action.

In which court should one bring action?  In their local jurisdiction? 
How can one reasonably sue a third party in a different state (or 
country!) on limited funds?

I control the copyright on my contributions, but I may not necessarily 
be able to decide which court will hear my case (if any court will).

> Enlist the various watchdog groups to your cause. 

This is taking action after the fact.  Podz has consistently been 
suggesting that action be taken _before_ any copyright violation occurs, 
to ensure that the best possible outcome be prepared.

Protection measures of all sorts turn people off; but people pursue them 
because the (perceived) benefit outweighs the (perceived) risk.

Assigning copyright to the FSF (or hell, even WordPress Inc., if that 
ever formalizes) allows that single entity to bring more resources to 
bear against all copyright infringements.   If FSF or WPI owns the 
copyright, they can bring a (hopefully) more effective suit against an 
infringer than a rag-tag collection of people from different states with 
different economy-class attorneys.

Another benefit to a single copyright holder is that that entity is then 
in a position to license the work to other parties under different 
terms.  If Tim O'Reilly came to WordPress right now and said "I want to 
publish the Codex, donating half of all proceeds to WordPress; but I 
don't want to share our source files", Tim would have to get permission 
from every single contributor.  A single copyright holder would be in a 
position to definitively say yea or nay.  If WPI owned the copyright, 
they could tell Tim "Sure thing!".  There would likely not be much 
uproar from the community were this (admittedly far-fetched) example to 
occur.

I thought even OSI's Open Source Definition took a dim view of requiring

Assignment to WP Inc. would raise hell that would dwarf this little
thread.  The conspiracy theories would flourish.

FSF has never brought suit against anyone.

That's a good example of why many people refuse to do copyright
assignment.  Their contributions can be relicensed in ways with which
they might not agree.

And I believe that if anyone currently publishes Codex, that the ensuing 
row would be huge (especially if it was anyone associated with the 
project), which is why I am suggesting that either this gets sorted now 
between a group of people who have WP interests at heart, or it gets 
sorted by a multitude of people who will have pleasure in seeing this 
project get some flak.

Still, I've said what I believe. I think that there are sufficient 
concerns that the 'wp experts' writing the book should - if they are 
using Codex at all - be very very careful. If we cannot sort this out 
and get agreement, no-one else will. And as these threads are incomplete 
due to being ignored by people who really should not, I too give up on 
the matter.

Podz, et al, when I have something to add to the conversation, I'll add 
it. Don't assume silence is anything other silence. We all have a vested 
interest in this. Thank you for pursuing it.

We need to have very precise clarity over the differences and 
similarities between GPL per code and docs, usage rights, and Copyright 
protections, what applies where and how. As a volunteer, I also want to 
know what support or protection "WordPress" will provide if necessary to 
protect "my" rights. A volunteer-based organization which maintains open 
communication and prides itself on supporting and understanding 
volunteer concerns and issues goes a very long way. Some very specific 
questions and concerns have been raised and we need to either be handed 
the final, professional and legal decision from the powers that be, or 
we all work together to clearly establish a precendence and not wait for 
the hurricane to do the damage before we consider insurance a viable option.

Lorelle, peeking up from under downed trees and flooding, again.

Can WP afford a lawyer ? Do we need to ? Is there someone else we can 
consult ? (seeing as FSF have been voted out) Is this being actively 
pursued ?

> or 
> we all work together to clearly establish a precendence
If GPL is involved, I fail to see where there is an precedence to be 
established. It's not like there is any room to move is there ?
If the GPL licence for Codex is wrong (and there should be very little 
doubt about that any more), then there are 2 options as I see it:
1 - Accept that it's wrong, learn to be more careful and establish just 
what can be done with the data. Bear in mind that right now it's only us 
looking at this issue. Whatever does happen will be subject to a lot 
more scrutiny by people who are looking to tear into this project
or
2 - Do something about it. Put a huge amount of work into /doing it right/.

Contrary to whatever impressions I have conveyed, I am NOT against 
publishing Codex. I am concerned though that a project that I have now 
been involved with for 21 months and have contributed extensively to 
does it properly and openly. That last word alone is not being done. 
There is a lot of slackness here and as I keep saying, do we sort this 
in-house or do we wait for <insert wellknown sites> to rip into us ? And 
bear in mind that the majority of people reading this will not be 
mentioned...

I do believe there is a book project being done right now - evidence is 
on the net - and I do believe that if it is published under the GPL then 
it will be done wrong. There's a saying here in football that during a 
match there are 22 players and a guy in black on the pitch, and 40,000 
referees watching. I think there's a parallel there.

People have been publishing GPL docs for over a decade.  See the Linux
Documentation Project.  We're not breaking any ground here.  Same old,
same old.

Just for you guys, you owe me one. :)

I think I have a good grip on everything now. To wit:

* Copyright always stays with whoever wrote it
* There is an implied license that you agree to when you submit content 
to a website, which has legal precedence.
* An explicit license notice is fine as well, no problems with GPL
* If there was mass infringement a single entity (like WP) could take 
action on behalf of copyright holders, so the cost burden wouldn't be on 
each person
* There is also some protection in terms of misuse of the WP trademark

Any questions I should pass on?

Sounds like it's pretty straightforward to me. I'd suggest putting it in 
the Codex somewhere. Doesn't need to be in your face, but should be 
somewhere readily available so that if someone is looking for it, they 
can find it.

Not just in the Codex either... but the forums search as well... I'd 
like to have the ability, from either location to say "Search Codex 
only" or "Search Forums only" or "Search Both"....

But that's just me.

Good stuff :)

My question now is this:
- what comes first ? The book or the code ?

If there is no reason to worry, then why not bring it into the open ? 
That could well attract further quality contributions which can only 
benefit Codex. My concern is that the book could be being written with a 
view to being launched at the same time as the code - if that is the 
case, then one of them takes priority and a guess would be the book will 
as that is a physical entity. That has implications should it be the case.

Why not say "Yes I/we are writing one" or "No I/we are not" ?

A little checkbox here or there would be nifty, though.

I know perfectly well she is.
I note that she has not chosen to tell these lists.
I note that she has not put this anywhere where someone considering 
their codex involvement would know of it.
I note both her silence and her previous statements.
I also note the logs of conversations and emails I have.

Whatever.
I quit my roles here on any lists, in any codex involvement or in 
anything else which I feel is doing WP users a disservice.

Lorelle - you have lied to me and you continue to deceive.

Podz,

The she I'm referring to is Deborah Woehr.

I think it very unfair to single out Lorelle!  Her contributions to Codex
can't even be quantified.  She's been the driving force (at least in the
short time I've been around) in improving Codex.  She's recruited
contributors, mentored newbies, and plainly been the 'go to' person for
Codex.  For that she has my thanks and sincere respect!

Now for the part you won't like.  Lorelle, and anyone else, has the right to
write a book.  They don't have to tell us they're writing a book.  They
don't need our blessing, they don't need our approval!  You compiled your
version of a Codex book and you were applauded.  We should extend that same
applause to others.

We need to encourage, not discourage, efforts to write a book about
WordPress.  I want to be the first one to buy such a book!

Warning posted by Brion Vibber 9/27/2005 to upgrade MediWiki sites:
>>>>>>
In case some of you out there haven't got around to it, don't forget
that 1.4.10 (1.3.16 for 1.3 branch) fixes a serious data corruption bug
which is triggered by the requests a particular spambot uses.

I strongly urge anybody out there running a 1.3 or 1.4 MediaWiki to
upgrade or at least apply the fix patch described in the release
announcement:

http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2005-September/000030.html

If your wiki gets hit by this corruption bug, you can only recover the
damaged data from a backup or extracting the original data from MySQL
binlogs, and that's a big pain in the butt.

1.5 wikis are not vulnerable to this problem.

Huh? By "code" do you mean WP 1.6?

If you guys want to do the "codex release" thing perhaps we could use 
Cafepress or Lulu to put out a physical book with a release, but my 
impression would be that'd take a lot of time and it'd probably be best 
a month or two after the release once the docs have had time to catch up.

Looks really great, but it is possible to show "This page" section only when
someone is logged?. I think new people could get messed with that on top

Looks great!

If possible please:
Add Go box somewhere in Codex Resources (Go box allows you to go to a
specific page (e.g. User Levels)
Move WordPress Lessons under Getting Started

Where will MediaWiki preferences, my watchlist, my contributions, logout be
placed?
Where will other tabs such as Move, Watch, Delete, and Protect show?

Thanks for the design.

Those will probably be sidebar things you only see when you're logged in.

I like the new design for the Codex very much. It has a nice clean look to
it. My suggestion is that the mailing list link at the bottom of the page
should have a more prominent position.

Not necessarily. I've on more than one occasion have given a link 
directly to that page in the forums for some one who was looking for 
XYZ. So some of it could be from those kinds of links too..... But 
still, that's a significant difference....
