Subject: [wp-docs] folder creation issues
Message-ID: <BAYC1-PASMTP105DA3F3919B82BF78FAEADAD50@CEZ.ICE>

I just joined the list to tackle this issue, so forgive me if it's 
already been attended to. I seem to be getting server errors when I 
tick the box that allows WP to create year and month folders for 
uploaded content if I try and upload an item for a new post.

I encounter the same problem when attempting to upload content across 
the XML-RPC interface to a new folder created by the client.

In both cases, the folder is created and is ChModed correctly (777), 
but no content can be written to it by WP or even by me personally via 
an ftp. This may be a server issue on my part, but I'm led to believe a 
small workaround in the code could fix the issue as  uploads work 
seamlessly when the option of spawning year and month folders is turned 
off.

Can someone point me to the function set responsible for creating new 
folders on the server?

Sorry, this list is strictly to discuss issues *related to* wordpress
documentation development, not actual support.  you should direct your

Subject: [wp-docs] Functions that generate html tags?
Message-ID: <4435543C.5080605@gunters.org>

Many of the template functions that we use will return plain text (e.g., 
  the_title, the_author, bloginfo, etc.). But some return HTML-tagged 
content (e.g., wp_list_pages, wp_list_cats, wp_loginout, etc.)

Has anyone documented which functions generate HTML, along with what tag 
structure they use? I did a quick Codex search, but nothing came up. I 
think this would be a very useful reference for theme developers to have.

Message-ID: <F8891481-BACA-4729-9878-21F1A04F5554@lucidgreen.net>

Hi,

I've written a very comprehensive installation guide of WordPress in  
a PDF e-book format. It covers (nearly) every topic and gives step-by- 
step instructions, with screen shots. I have plans to continue with  
this and write chapters on how to use wordpress and also how to  
customizing wordpress but don't have a lot of time right now. So I  
just thought this might be helpful for people who are really new to  
all this stuff and prefer to have all their info in one place.

Anyway I'm not sure where I should post this, can I just create a new  
page in the codex for it or what?

You can download it at www.lucidgreen.net/everymans_wp_install_guide.pdf

Nice work!!!

I added a link under the Installation section here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress

I also added a Resources section with the link to your PDF here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Resources

Also you might want to update (or create) your User page in Codex and add
that link there.

Thanks for your hard work.

This is a nice doc (looks like a lot of time was spent on it), but as
the initial focus is placed on setting up a wp.com blog, I have a wee
problem linking it from the Codex. Brandon, could you split this into
two documents, one for WordPress installation and one on wp.com?

We constantly try to define where the line for support of WordPress
(the software) ends and wp.com begins, and something like this will
only help to blur it.

Thanks for the tips guys. I've edited the docs, split them into two  
and posted links to them on my User page. You can see their links at:
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Anselm1109

I've updated the link at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress to point to the  
correct doc in its new location.

I've also (re)added it in as a link in the installation section under
http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress

This thread http://wordpress.org/support/topic/70152?replies=6
points out some discrepancies.  Since I don't know the differences, perhaps
someone who does can let me know what min requirements are for 1.2.x, 1.5.x,
and 2.0.x.  I'll be glad to correct the info in the codex once I have
confirmation.

Thanks.

As far as I know, PHP 4.1 is still the minimum requirement. Any higher
version, including PHP 5 is supported.

The user at the forum seems to be confused between the fantastico
installed WP and the manually installed WP. Removing all traces of the
fantastico installed WP would be good. Following the non-fantastico
install route with a new (or reset) set of database tables would be
the prescribed medicine :)

Regards,
Carthik.

Thanks for the reply, but the issue is this:
http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/
says 4.2
http://codex.wordpress.org/Hosting_WordPress
says 4.1 as of 1.2.2
regardless of the posters hosting issues, if 2.x needs PHP 4.2, but earlier
versions support 4.1, then the codex page needs to be updated.  Which is
what I'm trying to get to the root of.
