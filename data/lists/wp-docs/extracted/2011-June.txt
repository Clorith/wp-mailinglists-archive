Hi,

The user login page, http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:UserLogin
does not have a forgotten password link.

Is there a trick to getting a new password?

It was recently announced that all WordPress.org passwords have to be
updated with new ones and new logins due to a small security issues in the
Plugin repository. The forgotten password link should still be there though.
Try logging in through WordPress.org first.

Thanks, Otto. That gets me into support, but that password
doesn't work on the Codex login.

http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin

And there isn't a lost password link there.

Tried that. No link to get a new password for the Codex. Tried
old Codex password and new support password. No joy.

If the new password doesn't work, then no other password will.
Passwords are shared between support and the codex. There's no sync
process, it's real time authentication.

According to my attempts to login, if it doesn't work, email pw-reset-2011
at wordpress.org.

I'm also having trouble. I'm still banging my head against it and will
report results in a moment, I hope.

Here is the process that worked for me.

1. Try to login through WordPress.org. If that doesn't work...
2. Either go directly to http://wordpress.org/support/bb-login.php or use
the Forgot Password option to reset the password to an auto generated
version. It will send the confirmation with link to reset to the email
address registered with that account.
3. Click the confirmation link in the email.
4. WordPress will send the auto generated password.
5. Use that to log into WordPress.org.
6. Go to Profile and click Edit to change your password to a strong
different choice. Update.
6. Go to DOCS.
7. Login again with the new password.

It should work.

Not sure why we have to log in again in Docs, but that's what happens.

Note that gmail in particular seems unhappy about the large number of
emails we've been sending for this, and is marking most of them as
spam. Check your spam folder.

Cookie sharing across to the codex is broken. I lack access to fix it
at the moment, and it has not been a high priority.

This did work. It is a repeat of the steps I used following Otto's
email. I did try it much later. Perhaps that had some effect.

Thanks, Lorelle and Otto.
