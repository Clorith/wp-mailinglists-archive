No one's commented that WYSIWYG editing is a priority, and I decided 
to start my search for a better solution with the list of weblog clients at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Weblog_Client

To clarify, my goal is to find a recommendation (or two or three) for 
the occasional contributor to a group's website that's been set up in 
WordPress. There may be several people involved (so I'd really prefer 
a clean server-side solution), but I can see and might be able to 
sell the advantages of offline composition and being able to save 
local copies. I'd like the editor to be "css-aware" so we could use 
styles appropriate to the site without getting into editing HTML 
tags. A Windows solution would cover almost all of the participants 
in my groups, but philosophically I'd prefer a platform neutral solution.

Cost is an issue. The group(s) may be able to make a financial 
contribution to the development effort, but they wouldn't want to pay 
a fee for each person to use the tool -- especially when some of the 
contributors may be posting only a few times a year.

So what's that got to do with the Codex?

Well, the page referenced above lists 18 different Windows clients. I 
spent most of the weekend checking out different aspects and learning 
things about when XMLRPC works and when it doesn't. I've documented 
some of that at the discussion page 
-  http://codex.wordpress.org/Talk:Weblog_Client.

Questions that would help me shape the page in a direction I think it needs:

1. Does anyone consider the WYSIWYG editor problem solved? If so, 
what are you using?
2. Is there some other discussion of the problem that I need to read 
before going any further here? If so, what is it?
3. Have you experimented with client side tools for Windows and, if 
so, do you have time add comments to that Talk page?
4. Do you agree that it would be a good idea to point newbies to 2 or 
3 "best of show" tools (along with, perhaps, a list of all known 
tools for those who want to experiment)? Do you think that could be 
maintained with, say, a quarterly review?

Thanks, all!

Why is the Codex still running version 1.4 of MediaWiki?[1] Isn't it
kind of like a sitting duck in terms of security?

There seems little reason not to upgrade. Well, upgrading to 1.6 at the
most, since 1.7 and later only support PHP5. But even 1.6 is an
improvement over 1.4.

We've tried to upgrade several times in the past and failed. (It's not 
like we don't know a thing or two about PHP, either.) We'll try again in 
the future.
