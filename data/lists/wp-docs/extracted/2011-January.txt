I've a new question. When I have created a new page, do I have to put it in the New_page_created category ( with [[Category:New_page_created]] )? Because there is to Dutchmen in the Documentation team, and the Dutch translation team is mainly busy with translating the WordPress software.

If doing a translation of an existing article that category would not be 
necessary.

It's pretty much the same. There's no huge differences overall, just a 
couple extra "gotchas" for multisite.

- changing location on the server is slightly different
- moving to a different server is the same (with those gotchas like 
enable wildcards on the new server if using subdomains, and maybe, you 
know, asking your new host if they even support that before you buy an 
account there. seen it happen. More than once.)
- giving wp its own directory is not supported with multisite
- not sure how much of the Fatastico section applies or how much woudl 
be different.

Overall, it's mostly caveats.

Hi Codexers!

I would like to update the
is_tax()<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_tax>function
reference page, to list all of the core-registered taxonomies
(category, post_tag, nav_menu, link_category, post_format), with examples of
how to call/use each one. Is there a particular Section to which I should
add this information, or a particular format I should use?

Thanks in advance,

Chip

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_tax#Examples would probably 
be a good place to start.

Okay, I've taken a stab at edits.

I would greatly appreciate any constructive criticism, as I would next like
to tackle adding pages for get_post_format_link(), get_post_format_string(),
and has_post_format(), and so would like to know if I'm doing anything
egregiously wrong. :)

I have a feeling that something is wrong with the codex box or it got
an update or something. It's serving up the mediawiki FAQ file.

I can't fix it right now, since I don't have access to the codex
server at the moment. I'll get to it when I can.

I expect what's probably happened is that there's a (real) file called 
FAQ in the httpd directory, which is preventing the pretty link from 
working.  Once Otto can get on and sort it, it should just all revert 
nicely.

Keep in mind that is_tax() is useless for link categories and navigation
menus, as they don't have archive pages. It's also useless for categories
and tags, because is_tax() is exclusively custom taxonomies, and returns
false for these.

It *does* work for post formats, but it looks like we should be adding a
wrapper function there for a conditional tag for post format pages. I'll
take a look on adding one. Otherwise though, is_tax() is only useful for
custom, non-core taxonomies.

Cheers,
Andrew
