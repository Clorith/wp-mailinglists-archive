Subject: [wp-docs] Codex needs some help
Message-ID: <AANLkTim2hfygePbu1PfxDGBYCOn6tfKQgIw7XQTgac2p@mail.gmail.com>

Who takes care of the FTP for the codex? I have been looking at it and
thinking that it could use a bunch of help. Here is a list of things that
need help.

   - The MediaWiki theme needs the site bar.
   - The Codex theme needs a few changes, not the least of which being a
   change to the way the views are shown.
   - The word Codex on the Codex theme needs to point to the Main Page.
   - $wgLogo needs to be set to the WordPress logo.
   - The parser functions extension should be installed:
   http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ParserFunctions It includes *if* and
   *ifeq*.

If you want my help, I would be glad to give it. I have done quite a bit
with the Mediawiki engine before, and would gladly contribute.

Could you zip up the Codex theme files, and send them to me so I can work
with them? I have a wiki installed on one of my home computers.

Message-ID: <375982.67841.qm@web24108.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi Docs Team,

we just had a discussion in IRC regarding the upcomming changes of the wordpress.org website and it was said, that wordpress codex will be dropped (by wordpress core members). Next to the fact that this decission has been made totally intransparent and non-democratic, I'd like to get a database dump from codex wiki.

As far as I can see the codex is licensed under GPL as well as the wordpress software (it even might be considered as part of the wordpress software which is GPLed w/o any doubts). So I'm asking who is in charge and can provide the source data.

Please let me know and how you folks prefer to deliver it.

Best regards,

hakre

You know that because she CC'ed you. Can you please tell me who has access

Hi Arlen. As I explained to you in a private email to try and avoid 
noise to the full list, we don't just make changes because one person 
decides we should. It needs to go through the docs team, the UI team, 
the lead devs, etc. Who has FTP access is not the immediate issue, it's 
that the change you want to make needs to go through the right channels 
to be discussed and approved, and ONLY THEN would someone with ftp 
access think about making a change, under official direction. Just 
because it is a wiki doesn't mean it's a total free-for-all.

Also, please don't insult the tireless volunteers who work diligently on 
the Codex. We all know we have lots of room for improvement, but stating 
that no one cares the way you do is just an unprofessional slap in the 
face, and attitude that is not especially welcome given that most of the 
volunteers are busy professionals who give their time out of love for 
WordPress.

Thanks, Jane

I missed that one. I'll check the IRC logs later, but I haven't heard
anything about dropping the codex. The information there may be
reorganized, but there's a lot of useful stuff there that I'm pretty
sure we don't want to lose.

I think everybody should calm down and back up a bit. There's no rapid
changes occurring. We'll plan first, and people will be included.
Really.

Yes, I'm discussing this with hakre in IRC. No decisions have been made. 
I think a couple of people expressed *opinion* and it was 
misinterpreted. We will solicit community feedback before making any 
decisions of that magnitude. For now, the Codex is our documentation, 
and we should all be pulling together to update it for 3.0 instead of 
freaking out about a day in the future when we might have some other 
documentation that hasn't been conceived yet.

Jane and Matt are the ones to ask on this, but I have it straight from both
of them that the WordPress Codex will not be "dropped" but content will be
used in building the new documentation via subversion. I don't have the
latest information, but agree with Otto that we need to slow down and not
jump. Nothing is happening too dramatic. The Codex still has value as a
living document.

I presented to the group when the first announcements came out about how we
can shift the Codex as the repository of support docs to something else. I
suggested we explore more WordPress Lessons and how-to techniques, to share
a greater wealth of customization and techniques beyond what is offered in
the new documentation. I'd love to continue that discussion.

Thanks,

Lorelle

Sorry hakre, but no one made or announced a decision or suggested the
Codex was going anywhere.

Sorry docs team for the spam.

Here's what I just posted in IRC:
[4:10pm] JaneWells: the codex is our documentation. period.
[4:10pm] JaneWells: let's update it for 3.0.
[4:10pm] JaneWells: that's the current state of the word.
[4:10pm] JaneWells: "officially" :)

It's good to know that there are no plans to drop the codex. Maybe I read or understood something wrong. And please bare that english ain't my first language. I think we clarified all that in IRC directly as well.

In any case, my mail was mainly about the dumps and not the codex changes. So yes, please totally chill out on dropping the codex front, but please keep me updated about the dumps.

hakre

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex Wiki Database Dumps - Second try
Message-ID: <774057.99619.qm@web24108.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi Docs Team,

I recently posted to this mailing-list regarding the wiki database dumps of the codex:

http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2010-June/002209.html

As it became clear afterwards my words were misread by persons having english as first language - I have not. I must excuse my interpretable way of writing there based on maybe unclear readings of what was been written in IRC by nacin. I totally agree that there is no need to jump or exagerate the upcomming changes of the codex, in fact right now no official decisions have been made how the changes will actually look like. I have and already had understood that.

As that thread shows, the discussion of the codex is one on its own and not everybody in the core team has the same opinion about that. So everybody can see, there is no official opinion about the future of the wiki.

But my mail was about something totally different. It is about how and where to retrieve the database dumps of the GPL'ed wordpress codex wiki content. I'm sorry if that request just jumps into a current discussion you have on re-designing wordpress.org. I just want to remind on that, because an answer to this question has not yet been given by email.

With this email I'd just like to focus again on my main request because a re-start from scratch might be the best:

I'm asking who is in charge and can provide the source data of the codex.

Please let me know and how you folks prefer to deliver it.

If all resources are currently covered with the 3.0 release, I can somehow understand, so if you can provide it after the release, that would be okay for me.

But please let me (and everybody else who might be interested) know how this is dealt with.

Best regards,

hakre

I don't believe there is any requirement for a database dump to be provided and it is not something that is done at the moment

It is my understanding that the codex content is GPL and any reuse of it would have to honour that licence but it is never distributed so the distribution clause of the licence would never be invoked

OK. So after things cooled down a bit, can you answer me a question for clarification?

Are there any plans to change away from the mediawiki software as the codex?

Short answer: No.

Long answer: We all have hopes and dreams. If jQuery can do it, surely
we can too eventually.

JQuery is client side, not server side. So, apparently, we can't do it
either. :-D

Nacin's referring to the fact that jQuery is using WordPress to host
its documentation, not to the jQuery code itself.

Yeah, that. I have ideas for a WP based wiki. Custom post types can be
entertaining, perhaps...

If you want to ask Jane a question directly, then send her an e-mail.

You've been harping on this for a few days now, interpreting off-the-cuff
IRC comments as if they were written in stone or were some sort of an
executive decree. Calling Jane out is not going to get you anywhere,
especially not after your questions have been addressed over e-mail and in
IRC by Peter, me, and others. You also called me out in an earlier email on
this same subject -- so if I know the answer, I'm going to provide you an
answer.

Just to remind you nacin, this was a clarification question to a mail Jane wrote here in the mailinglist.

There's been a few templates [1] added to Codex recently that are taken from 
Wikipedia.

Are there any copyright issues involved with using those templates in Codex?

Mark Jaquith mentioned that 'We're even considering "taking a release
off" to work on WordPress.org'. [1]

If this is the case, maybe as part of this it would be a good idea to
co-ordinate a documentation improvement drive. Kind of like a bug hunt
but a not-very-good-documentation-hunt instead. In fact it could take
just the same format as a bug hunt, but rather than going through
tickets, volunteers would go through Codex articles and update or
improve them as necessary. We could even identify areas that need new
Codex articles writing and do that at the same time.

I've also noticed [2] that the Info Page for each of the mailing lists
are completely void of information (probably one of the main reason
wp-hackers gets its steady stream of threads that don't really belong
there). I don't know if Mailman allows for these pages to be
customised, but they could be used to provide a big pile of
information about exactly what the mailing list is and where best to
get support in cases where the mailing list isn't appropriate.
Information to go on these pages could be written as part of the
documentation drive.

Does this sound like a good idea? I think many members of the
community would be willing to help out as we all know the docs need
improving but I know personally that the motivation to do it is low (I
do try!). A co-ordinated effort by the commnunity would give a big
lift to all those involved.

We've done these in the past and they have been very successful and very
not. :D They key is that they be coordinated and very clear in their
intention and structure.

People who write really awesome articles on WordPress want to "own" the
content. They also tend to want credit and links back to themselves to
further their reputation and often get paid jobs as a WordPress expert.
Finding a way to make this process work without the "I" and credit and make
it a team effort is the challenge.

The most successful approach has been when we work on the documents together
as a team across a one to two month "swarm" time (
http://www.scottporad.com/2009/06/24/want-to-get-more-done-heres-how-do-less/)
it is very successful as one comes up with an idea, writes it up in a
specific section off the table of contents, people add to it, edit it, and
develop the idea further though conversations in the IRC for docs. When it's
ready, it's moved into the final spot on the Codex and added to the TOC.
It's very intense and really works well.

Call to actions for people to submit their documents like a competition or
just encouraged to do so have been very unsuccessful. It's the stimulation
that comes from working with like minds that seems to encourage
participation rather than "here's my article" and the docs team having to
edit the "I" out of it. Boring work for all involved.

I'd love to take the energy from the WordPress 3.0 release to get the docs
team rocking. So that's a look at the past. What can we do now?

I think accrediting peoples contributions to codex articles, and retain a
certain amount of the "I" as well as the "we" would perhaps encourage more
contributions.

If I go to any codex page now, I can't actually see who started it, who was
the last person to add to it, how many lines/words were contributed...
However, when it comes to code, we can see how many patches/commits people
have made, etc etc.

Perhaps this is part of a wider discussion about wp.org profiles and
rewards/awards, but I think its worth thinking about.

Actually you can see all that stuff in the Codex history...

That aside though, I believe that the Codex should be as it is - a 
repository for instructional information: not a place where people add 
their contributions purely as a way to gain popularity or link juice for 
their own websites.  Some "contributions" amount to little more than a 
link, to be especially harsh.

I'm all for a drive to document, and would help as much as I can (though 
I'm more of a maintainer than a core documenter unless it happens to be 
an areas that I know something about.) but I wouldn't like to see a 
free-for-all where the effort is in fact to get your[1] name attached to 
as many docs as possible so that you[2] become more popular.

[1] Using your in the general sense here, not your specifically.
[2] And again.

Every article has a History that can be used to determine each and every

You can find all that (and more) from the History link on each
Codex page.

The copyright messages on Wikipedia seem to relate to the content itself 
rather than the delivery mechanism, so I can't be sure. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Copyright

There may I suppose be licensing issues if the templates class as 
content and the license to use the content is not applicable to the 
WordPress Codex.

Sorry, I should have been clearer. I'm aware you can visit the history for
an article, but only if you log in, and only if you trawl through the
articles history.

A summary like this would be cool, without having to visit the history page:

* 24 people have contributed to this page,
* First created by [username] and last updated by [username]

And it would need a good deal of thought, to obviously stop people from
contributing merely for link juice, but I'm not proposing we have links back
to their sites. Just a better way to feel appreciated for the often
thankless task of wiki contributing.

And to be honest, I don't think a well designed system would be used to just
generate linkbacks, for example if your contribution is reverted then the
'karma' is also reverted, and possibly a penalty incurred.

I think the wp.org redesign needs a big dollop of BuddyPress, and it would
be a shame if the codex was left out of that process. It could certainly
encourage more people to add unique content in this centralised place.

I am not a lawyer.

http://codex.wordpress.org/GPL

Codex licensing is GPL. Wikipedia content is GFDL/CC-BY-SA. These are generally considered not compatible.

http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2003/04/msg00258.html

My personal thoughts are that the Codex itself is under incorrect licensing, as the GPL is designed as a document license. Welcome to license hell.

You could automate that off the history. I would change the First to
Largest contributor (by character count) since that is easy to track
and might catch major revisions.

It would be a bitch to do by hand, but an automated solution which
used current stats would be pretty easy on additional resources.

And we can always blame the code if someone doesn't agree with the
credits. :)

I also agree that it should be CC-By-SA so as to be compatible with
Wikipedia. I am sure that content coming from Wikipedia would be
legal, but no idea about the other way around. All that is needed is a
note indicating that it came from Wikipedia and a link to the page.
Wikipedia would then take care of the attribution.

 Just a side-note about those templates. The reason they look so bad
is because the codex is missing a plugin.

I think to be safe we should probably remove these as the licences are incompatible.

Why do we need them?  We've been fine so far without them what do they give us that we need?

There's been a few templates [1] added to Codex recently that are taken from Wikipedia.

Are there any copyright issues involved with using those templates in Codex?

http://codex.wordpress.org/Template:transclude

The  person who added those templates wrote that he is connected to the mediawiki project. Maybe he is even the original author of those template or has copyright of it and can cross license it under GPL. I think you should ask him first.

Gathering more resources will basically not help to resolve the structural problem of this project, to name the two directly connected to codex: specification and documentation. Putting this on the technical side only shifts that a bit from left to right.

That sounds like a good idea per-se, but I wonder how that would be done. Especially when this starts to conflict with the upcomming changes being more on the techncial side than on the content and both might work vice-versa for some time. Are there any migration plans for the case there is a switch away from MediWiki?

Good point, the only answer I can give is: By creating collaborative work. Therefore this would need a healthy community.Communication problems can not be solved by software.

You should spend some time with team-leaders who have some experience with such issues (wikipeidians *might* be nice to talk with, but if you find contact to someone how has experiences in establishing intranets in larger companies is a good start as well). I had the feeling next to all the shortcomings this world has, doing collaborative work in a wiki software like the mediawiki we already have (not that it won't need a lot of love) does fairly good work at that end - even in the times of today.

I could imagine if the codex wiki had a working editor for example, this would engage others to contribute more. That's something I see unfixed for ages. Next to that a little CSS touch-up maybe? What should be done first here is to run a little usability test iteration over the wiki, because with so light changes there you could make a big difference.

And next to that, there is a whole new world to discover. E.g. if you want to better structure content I suggest to extend wiki with semantics:

http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Forms

That can be pretty rocking (and save the project resources while doing the redesign, if the current suggestions have not set into stone yet).

What the codex needs is not more attribution, or links, or anything else of
that nature. By now you all know that I believe in the Codex very much. A
couple things that can go a long way in helping to establish a site are
aesthetics and functionality. A site has to have enough of both. One thing I
might mention is that the codex does not have a full-time management team
like wikipedia does. Of course, the team only needs to have one or two
people, but they are needed full-time. If a wikipedian comes around ready to
work, and finds out that it doesn't have some of the important functionality
of Wikipedia, they might get frustrated if there isn't a place to propose
additional functionality (although they probably would stay for a while,
like I am).   ;-) By *management team* I mean people who have access to the
FTP, and everyone knows they do, and they have the final say in
functionality changes, though I think major design changes should go higher
up.

Another thing a site needs is ease of use. Coming from WikiMedia, it seems a
bit hard to use as it is. When I mentioned this to someone, they said that
people can always use the MediaWiki skin. That certainly work, but it
doesn't have the site bar, and I think that major contributers should use
the default skin some of the time anyway, so they know what their styles and
page designs look like to people stopping by for answers. Also, would it be
possible to redesign all of wordpress.org to make the links a bit darker and
get rid of the gray? It strains my eyes a bit to look at them, though not
much. :-)

Also, the license is, they say, incompatible with Wikipedia, which I say is
a no-no. Wikipedia recently did a licence change, so we could too, it
isn't unprecedented. If we change the license, we have to do it before the
doc drive, or else we will have more problems.

Finally, I totally believe that mediawiki is the right thing to use for the
job. I really like contributing codex, and am waiting to *par*ticipate in
the *an*ticipated doc drive.

Cheers

No, I am not the author, but I am an active worker on Wikipedia, Wikibooks,
and Wikisource. The templates and so forth that we have there
are phenomenal, and being that the Codex seemed to be lacking something, I
copied them over. Would it be possible to license certain things under
CC-by-SA? It would allow them to stay there. Of course, I know they look
terrible, and are waiting for a plugin, but they have great functionality,
and add much to the look of the site. Also, the attitude of "*why do we need
them?"* can kill progress, although I could have taken it wrong and Peter
just simply didn't know what they were for, which is very likely, as they
look terrible right now. They have the same name on Wikipedia, and if anyone
is wondering what they do, you can look there. :-)

Please don't let an "an*ticipated doc drive"  discourage you from 
contributing now.  The Stubs category[1] of articles is one place to start. 
Pick an article, review it, improve it, then remove the {{Stub}} template.

Welcome and thanks for contributing to Codex.

Arlen: you may not put existing work into our Codex unless it is 
licensed under the GPL. Period. Stick with original content to avoid 
this issue. Thanks.

GPL compatible is enough and it must be  to version 2 only might one admit.

Contacting the original author of those and getting a fitting license for them can do the job as well. So there are multiple paths to solve that.

Leaving the copyright issues aside, I guess for me this would all be 
much easier to follow if you were to describe your overall plan on this 
list.  I've seen your creation of a lot of meta-pages on the Codex, but 
it's all kinda one-man-army just now as its not obvious (to me at least) 
what the intention is.

If you are directing the question to me, my overall plan is this. To take
the codex from where it is, and make it better than, or at least as good as,
Wikipedia. There is a lot of potential that is untapped. You name it, it is
most likely there. Therefore, I want to make the codex an excellent,
complete, and active documentation of WordPress. In fact, the
whole WordPress site could use some help, although not much. It is very good
quality as it is. Concerning those meta-pages, it is called a WikiProject.
Basically a way to organize and let volunteers know what needs help.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikMy3BvjM9sDFwe1KfI4E8k9fs9yhh9v9eVKSV8@mail.gmail.com>

I'm new to this listserv thing -- I normally use forums instead. Let me know
about etiquette and I'll fix that on later posts.

I have been speaking with one of the core devs on WP about a change that is
desirable in the WP docs. I'm a plugin developer, and there are two tough
things for me:

- figuring out which WP Codex API function works with which version of
WordPress

- figuring out which jQuery function works with which version of WordPress

Unfortunately as much as I want to move forward, not all people are on 2.9.2
or later versions of WP. It's a plugin and theme thing, where the other
plugin and theme developers are not keeping up with the latest versions of
WP and routinely preparing for the future by testing with the betas.

So, by having the Codex docs let us know something like...

"API added 6/8/2010. Works with 2.9.2 and forward"

...or perhaps even an added comment like...

"Feature [or parameter] of this API added with 2.9.2 and forward"

...that would be a tremendous help. If we don't want to do that practice
retroactively because it's too much work, then at least going forward it
would be a nice thing to do to minimize developer frustration.

While these are helpful in determining the documentation that the docs team
needs to do within the WordPress Codex, this is not a support mailing list.
Are you offering to write or improve such documentation?

Hi docs team --

There's a suggestion coming out of
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13736 to change a link from
"Administration_Panels#Comments" to a placeholder page much the way we have
a lot of the super admin panels currently.

If you could voice your opinions, that'd be helpful. I don't think there are
many links that are deserving of change, but that ultimately comes down to
what you feel is deserving of its own article.

Thanks,
Nacin

I think Mike was just putting it out there as an idea for discussion.
This is the docs discussion list after all.

I think this is a good idea and something I'd like to see. It sounds
like something that could potentially be generated automatically in
the same manner as PHPdoc.

Mike, which dev were you talking with about this? What was their response?

Use this:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Comments_Comments_SubPanel

It's redirecting to Combating Spam while a more useful article is 
implemented.

This ticket/question goes to the newly expanded help tabs for each screen  
of the Admin Dashboard for 3.0. Check it out if you've downloaded the 
release  candidate. People will have a new and immediate help option right in 
their  installations.
 
My understanding is that whatever links are decided upon will be set in for 
 the duration, until 3.1 comes out. The content of each Codex page can be 
edited  at any time, but not the links. So we should decide pretty quickly 
whether  to separate out pages. I could go either way, except that any changes 
slightly  increase the complexity levels all around.
 
These pages in particular could start getting many more visits once 3.0  
come out. I've identified 13 that most notably need help, because they're  
placeholders with no text, or have neon signs saying they need other help. I'll 
 send these along in a separate email in a few minutes.

Thanks for that. I was about to say "one less page to update!" but made the 
 mistake of looking at it. There are now a lot more export filter options 
in  3.0 than just "restrict author" so I took a stab at updating the text. It 
 still needs a much more current screenshot, if anyone is interested in 
working  more on this page (Tools_Export_SubPanel) and checking what I  added.

Why are we using a software licence on the codex? I was just reading through
it to see if it is compatible with CC-By-SA, and it said

It is obvious that we have the wrong licence. Is the GFDL compatible with
the GNU General Public Licence? It seems it would be.

If you folks here get some grip on a new wiki docs-run and establish a team for it, I will provide a list of all functions for all wordpress point releases.I can provide at least a list in form of a spreadsheet (containing something suggested values like date, major release etc), if not as well a patch on wordpress core so that the missing @since tags are completed.

> - figuring out which jQuery function works with which version of WordPress

I have no idea how to do that therefore I must admit. So I can not make any promises on this one.

How are they incompatible? I read the two over briefly, and it didn't seem
incompatible, though they easily could be. Could you point me to where you
are reading.

Also, this is a software licence, not a documentation license. The whole
licence doesn't make sense from a documentation point of view. I, for one,
am releasing all my contributions under GPL, CC-By-SA, and (will maybe) GFDL
(just in case). That includes all past contributions. If all the
contributors would do the same, or at least GPL and CC-By-SA, it would help
quite a bit.

Cheers,
Arlen

The issue of why the Codex is GPL is a valid question, and one I am not 
getting into here.

What I will get into is that at this time is that right now, the Codex 
*is* licensed as GPL. That means that CC-by-SA is not compatible, 
because it requires attribution -- a restriction on how users use the 
content. If you want to license content about WordPress under a CC-By-SA 
license, then you should post it on your own site, not on the Codex, as 
the two licenses are not compatible, since they say inherently different 
things.

This is an interesting point. If you write content on WordPress which is 
GPL licensed, why would you then use CC-By-SA. Surely there would be 
limitations? Depends on the type of  content possibly?

I am releasing it under both licences, to facilitate changing it, and what
not. GPL is a software licence, and CC-By-SA is a generic license (sort of),
more documentation oriented. I would require everyone to release it under
CC-By-SA if I had my way. And no, there are no limitations to releasing
something under two licences. It is GPL *OR* CC-By-SA, not AND. You can use
either.

However, you do not have your way in this case, and just because you 
want the WordPress Codex to be licensed according to your desires 
doesn't make it so. I'm not disputing that GPL is a strange choice for 
the Codex, I'm disputing that CCbySA is in any way compatible. If you 
post anything to the Codex under a CCbySA license, it will be removed, 
as it is incompatible with the overall Codex license.

If I understand correctly, I think he's saying that he would release  
it to the codex under GPL, and release it on his own site under CCbySA.

Arlen - you should try working with the system rather than against it  
some time, I promise it's much more enjoyable and productive all  
round. You need to pick the battles that are worth fighting.

To that end, Arlen22's statement about releasing his contributions under 
CCbySA have been deleted from his user page and have notified via his talk 
page.

Multiple licensing can be a sticky thing. But it's moderately common. As 
an example sometimes seen in software, a developer might dual-license a 
library as GPL and also under a commercial license. Users can use the 
software under the GPL, and accept the responsibilities of that license. 
But a corporate entity might choose to purchase the code under the 
commercial license, because then they won't be required to GPL any of 
their *own* code when they incorporate the library into their own projects.

I can see dual licensing something as GPL and CC-By-SA for similar 
reasons. In the case of documentation, a publisher might not want to 
include GPL'd content, because it would require them to license the 
entire book under GPL (or a compatible license). But they could choose 
the CC-By-SA license, as long as they give attribution to the original 
author.

That is what I am doing. Dougal described it exactly. If you still don't get
it, think of it this way. I am separately publishing whatever I contribute
as GPL and also as CC-By-SA. Meaning that if you want to use it on a GPL
licensed site, you can; as well as on a CC-By-SA licensed site.

Which I guess is fine, for stuff that you create.  But you can't, say, 
take something that is already published under one licence, change it, 
and then place that something somewhere where it would be under another, 
incompatible licence.    So it doesn't really help you when it comes to 
taking wikipedia stuff and putting it onto the Codex.

One ticket left before release relates to users enabling the network
(turning on multisite) and not being able to login. If the user clears their
cache AND their cookies, then all is well.

This ticket is marked as needs-codex so we can document this somewhere for
the few who have been encountering this. It's sporadic, happening every once
in a while.

Any ideas on where to make mention?

I'd suggest either one of the existing FAQ pages, or the creation of a 
multisite FAQ page, if one doesn't already exist...

I'm not even certain there was a codex FAQ page for WPMU....

(ie; it probably doesn't exist, but probably should)

Yeah, I know. Thanks for the reminder (and publicity, for everyones
benefit). If I didn't *have to publish it under GPL, it would be fine to
copy.*

**P.S. I don't mind the license much, don't get me wrong, but I *do* like
discussing stuff and getting input.

Appearance > Themes is using http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes
which is outdated and too general. #Adding_New_Themes is now obsolete.

I suggest cleaning Using_Themes (permanently replace to
Appearance_Themes), add
http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Themes_SubPanel#Manage_Themes
for Manage Themes tab and
http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Themes_SubPanel#Install_Themes
for Install Themes tab.

The result:

Appearance

It is too late to change any help tab links, as we are in string freeze 
and announcing RC3 today with an anticipated final launch of early next 
week. If some Codex pages have outdated information, let's just update 
the content so they are current.

Just created these two pages with some very basic information and structure:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Post_Types
http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Taxonomies

Documentation on these in the codex was extremely lacking. However, if
anybody has good examples or more information they'd like to add, then
please help me fill these out. I'd like to see the Codex start to
cover more tutorial types of things like these.

I was wondering if it would be appropriate to create a page solely 
dedicated to the White Screen of Death on the Codex? A page that 
explains what it is, how it can be caused and steps to take to try and 
solve the problem to make it go away.

If not, is their a page with WsOD information already on it that we 
should be linking to?

First, I'm new to this list and to editing the codex. I apologize ahead of
time if I step on any toes or make any mistakes.

I'm looking at this page:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Business_Blogging_and_Shopping and I think it
needs a total re-write, as it seems to be endorsing wp-ecommerce as 'the'
ecommerce plugin, plus the intro and ending paragraphs seem really spammy to
me.

Any suggestions, does anybody want to hold my hand as I do this, or should I
just jump right in?

This sounds reasonable.

The best place to discuss the codex is the wp-docs list - CC'd

That way you can interact with all the volunteers who write documentation but are not subscribed to wp-hackers

How can the team help? Is there a list, or is it just by experience and
expertise to know what needs to be gone or marked as deprecated?

I can clean up the Task List http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks and you
can add a list of docs there that we can take turns on and check off, if
that will help.

I've cleaned up the task list a bit and included

I recommend that everyone pitch in and mark appropriate pages as old pages,
request for deletion, or deprecated so they will appear on the Special Pages
listing for those. Those with higher permissions can go through those lists
and take actions to deal with the marked pages.

Sound like the easiest of plans? :D

Thanks,

Lorelle

Good idea.  I'd also add checking for and purging out old, excessive, 
unnecessary or seo-grabbing links.  There tends to be far too much in 
there at the moment that's no better than a google search, and where we 
have, say, one link that singles out a plugin, it looks as if it's being 
actively recommended ahead of others, which is not so great.

Those that are interested in marking pages can add the following 
template

{{Oldpage|2.0}}

(Change 2.0 for the obsolete version being referenced, as appropriate)

First - standing ovation. The database description is freakin' amazing!
Kudos! Shouts from roofs. Incredible. Wow! I didn't realize it had been
updated so beautifully!

Second, great job. Come on, crew, let's get to work!

Agreed. We also have some pages that are simply outdated. Sadly, the Widget
API page covers pre-2.8 almost exclusively, and I had to go in and remove a
note not long ago that said it is discouraged to actually use the 2.8 API.
If someone wants to rewrite that page before I do, that'd be awesome :-)

Entire sections should not be devoted to "X.X or earlier", especially when
X.X is less than say 2.8. I would suggest that such sections should be
boiled down to a few sentences and stuck in a "Notes on Previous Versions"
bit at the bottom.

I would love for it to be a "Changelog," but using that word implies it is
both consistent and complete. I do love how php.net does that (as often I
have to check a function or an argument for 4.3 compatibility).

Drool worthy tables there. :) I know someone recently did an updated 
diagram. I wonder if I can get him to add it.

Also, how do we go about integrating the multisite option and this page?

I've requested from the "officials" to help us with a mass cleaning of the
spam on the Codex. So let's stop the manual effort for now as that could
interfere with the process. If they can't do it, we'll get back to work on
this manually, but there are more than 600 of these. It takes FOREVER to do
this manually.

Is there some latency here?
The first 3 I checked had already been deleted.

p.s. there are 599 items. Is the plan to do it manually? I'm going to 
hoe in (right after WorldCup coverage) but ... this needs to be 
headed-off or automated.

Some of the pages in the search results do appear to have already been 
deleted.  Some more are being deleted just now.  I'm unclear as to how 
quickly the search page updates, but am thinking it's not very.

I think if you drop in around the page 300-400 mark you'd definitely 
find some.

As for your other point, if there's a database way to selectively remove 
the spam, that's brilliant, otherwise it'd be a manual effort (not 
impossible, we scrubbed hundreds when the spam first hit).  It has been 
headed off  - anti spam measures were put in place a few weeks back - 
the ones in this result set pre-date those measures.

I've started another thread on this by accident. Sorry. Just heard from Matt
that they are going to clean this up and will be stopping open registration
on the Codex, since those registered on the forums and such don't need a
separate login, which may help prevent some of the spammers. Not sure how it
works behind the scenes, but this is a great move.

Thanks!

As noted in the other thread on the subject, Matt just replied and agreed
that something has to be done from their end as this is just too much of a
burden on the docs team due to the quantity involved. They are also looking
at turning off open registration on the Codex as registration across .org is
all combined. This should help prevent some of the spammers using MediaWiki
secret sauce methods of spamming.

We'll get more details soon, but in the meantime, thanks all for trying to
do this manually, but let's let the magic of MySQL clean this out behind the
scenes and hopefully help to reduce this kind of spamming.

Thanks!!

One great idea would be to disable anonymous edits. That way you could
rollback all edits made by users, and then delete it and block the IP.
Another idea would be to semi-protect high traffic pages, like the main
page. This makes users wait four days (or so) until they can edit those.
This would block drive-by spammers who are ingenious enough to make an
account from editing high traffic pages. By the way, this should only be
used on high traffic pages, for now anyway, as there is not nearly as much
activity as on WikiPedia. Another thing used with success on WikiBooks is
reviewing. Someone with reviewer privalages (easy to get if you are a major
contributor, given by Admins I think) marks whether the current version is
stable. Or you can select a previous version. Then anyone who is not logged
in, and anyone who specifies it in their preferences, will see the stable
version. If there is no stable version, the latest version is used.

Yep that's great hope they can come up with something.  The spam is 
fairly formulaic so shouldn't be too tricky.

Is this the case even for people who have older .org logins?  I know 
when I first joined I had to create a separate login for the Codex.

Just slightly concerned that people currently can't get a new Codex 
account. (The "create account" link on Codex has gone now, I notice.)

http://codex.wordpress.org/it:Main_Page

<http://codex.wordpress.org/it:Main_Page>That is the link to the Main Page
in Italian. It looks like it needs to be translated. It looks like you
should use the "it" namespace for italian language. So yes, it is possible,
just make sure you have the same page name for the original and the
translation.

Oops, I mean "..for the original and the translation, and that the
translation page is in the "it" namespace". I forgot that. ;)

We are in the middle of making some changes, it looks like this is an
unprecedented problem and will probably be reverted or fixed soon.

Just to add, the convention is to create any new pages under your user 
page first before dropping them into the main structure.

So you'd create new pages under arturo84/it:somepage

And once it's finished it could be moved to it's real location.

Yes the problem is actual. One person already couldn't log in with his
wp.org username. Also, what is the point of disabling account creation if
people can just go to wp.org and do the same thing?

I believe that this is an oversight, user creation has been disabled due 
to spam, it's meant to link into your forum account, but I'm not sure it 
does.  I expect someone will look into it shortly. (I've reported the 
issue and the guys do occasionally check this list)

Good questions. The logins, to the best of my understanding, were all merged
a long time ago. If you log into the wp.org, the login takes you everywhere
within the site. For spammers, especially bots, they are focusing on
mediawiki logins, not WordPress.org, so this stops technical blocks them as
they are bots. For the human spammers, it's another hoop they have to jump
through and they might not know to jump. So we can only hope.

I just tested it and you're right. New registrants on WordPress.org can't
get access to the Codex. It's probably a permissions level issue. I've let
them know and we should have an answer shortly. Thanks for pointing it out.

I have different logins for the codex and for .org. I don't think the 
codex users have been merged yet.

Matt says that now that logins are locked, new registrations to the Codex
are temporarily blocked. They are looking at how to resolve this issue to
permit "open" registration while controlling the level of spam and the work
volunteers need to do to deal with it.

In the interim, that puts the action in the hands of those currently with
access. I'm very unhappy with this status, as I'm sure most of you are. If
there are any MediaWiki experts in our crowd that have some suggestions on
how to help with this issue, would love your input. Personally, I think
Akismet should be the first to embrace spam prevention on MediaWiki  - would
resolve a ton of issues for wiki fans, including Wikipedia. :D I ask so
much, don't I?

Ideas?

Lorelle

Hello Lorelle,

Personally I favor the idea of approving accounts manually, and having a 
select (international) doc team. Possibly covering the major languages 
in any case.  How to do this for lesser used languages?

Another option could be to implement a WordPress article approval 
system, where all changes/ additions to the codex for example in the 
form of new articles must be approved for publishing by textmoderators.

Of course this raises the question whether or not the people approving 
should (be able) to see if the information entered is valuable.

Might help if some regular meetings (video conferences) are set-up where 
codex writers sit down with code developers in order to write things down.

Just a few ideas. Open for other suggestions by all means.

Hope it helps.

Kind regards,

Gooitzen van der Ent

Ok.  Should we be including a note to the effect that registration is 
temporarily unavailable on the Codex front page?

I thought that anti-spam measures were introduced after the last spam 
blip?  All the stuff in the search results now predates those measures. 
I haven't noticed a large scale spam attack since the last one happened 
and someone from the web team said they had turned something on to 
combat spam.

Wikibooks has used reviewing with great success. If someone wants to review
articles, they can request editor or reviewer status. Editor status can be
given automatically or manually by an admin. Reviewer status is a
higher privilege required only for giving pages featured book status and
some other stuff. It is assumed that editors can be trusted as they have
made many contributions. If someone is writing a wikibook, they can usually
get editor status. I think some admins said once that it really cut down on
drive-by spam and so forth. Something like this would give us the ability to
control what visitors see when they visit. If a page is not reviewed the
latest revision is shown. If a page is reviewed, the latest stable revision
is shown.

I suspect though that this works best were there are a lot of reviewers 
/ editors.  On the codex there's a fairly small team of admins, and a 
few key contributors who may (or may not) desire to review other work.

Also the concept of something being reviewed could discourage small, 
quick edits.

I guess what I'm saying is that I am not greatly convinced of the need 
to massively change the way Codex works.

Sufficient would, I suspect, be to limit the number of edits a normal 
user can make in a specified period.  Most spam attacks work because 
they blast a load of new pages out automatically in a short time. 
Normal users don't do this.  So all you really need is a limit on this 
sort of thing.  The admin team can easily handle small-scale spam.

I'm hoping this will be resolved faster than a notice on the front of the
Codex will help. If nothing improves in the next couple days, nag me (in the
middle of a huge launch and book writing projects) and I'll put a notice up.


Thanks!

 Automatic editor status criteria

You should *automatically* get editor tools when/if you meet the following
criteria:


   - Have a registered account that is *at least* 30 days old, with an email
      set and confirmed in
Special:Preferences<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Preferences>
      .
      - Have never been blocked, and have never had the editor or reviewer
      tools removed (you can request the
tools<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:RFP> in
      this case).
      - Have *at least* 100 edits since registration (excluding deleted
      edits), in which:
   -
      - 50 or more edits are to pages other than discussion pages.
         - 50 or more edit
summaries<http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/edit_summaries> are
         used.
         - 10 or more unique pages are edited *at least* once.
         - 10 edits are spaced 2 or more days apart from each other (which
         takes *at least* 18 days, if you edit every 2 days).
         - 10 or more edits are in recent
changes<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges> at
         the time automatic editor promotion is checked.


I requested and got my editor privileges via the request page as I didn't
have enough edits yet and was making a wikibook. It was nothing special or
unusual, jus because I was a good contributor.

If you have editor or reviewer privileges, you can review your own edits,
and I believe it marks your own edits as reviewed by default anyway.
Besides, any contributors can easily get the privileges if they have a
reason. So, in reality, it is less restrictive than it sounds. I do agree
that if the team is too small, which I don't think it is, it could be a
progress blocker.

This might be a good idea, but I don't think it would work very well, as
someone designing templates or something like that will run into drastic
problems if they use subpages and parser functions.
