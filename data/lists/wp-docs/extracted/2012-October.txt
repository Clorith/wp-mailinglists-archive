Subject: [wp-docs] Feedback request - WordPress Help Manual platform
Message-ID: <CADZaJgM-b3B3xezFmPrqCXJuhshjvAMVEMTwvG7UZSYyhhdBPA@mail.gmail.com>

I am interested in developing a GPL help authoring platform for WordPress
similar to my proprietary system

http://wpacademy.tv/ww3.htm

As I feel this would be a valuable software for people who publish help
systems.

It was suggested on this forum that I contact WordPress Foundation.  I have
done but have not gotten a response, nor from WordPress.tv.  I am willing
to do this if there is sufficient support for it.  Probably the most
immediate requirement / need is for someone to create and manage the
Sourceforge (or WP svn), and try and recruit programmers.  I am willing to
project manage the development process.

Appreciate any ideas and feedback for how to get this going.

THanks

Marc

Hi Marc. Matt handles requests sent in via the Foundation site 
personally, but I can usually give a general answer on things. I didn't 
see your original request, but is there a reason you wouldn't just start 
development of a GPL tool using the existing plugin svn or on github if 
you wanted to make collaboration easier? If it's not a WordPress-based 
system, then we probably wouldn't really go that route.

I think the best thing to do is to get involved with the group actively 
working on improving wordpress.org free/GPL support materials, at 
http://make.wordpress.org/support. I don't see us starting a separate 
documentation/training site effort, but the team working together there 
(with Mika at its head) can tell you the best ways to contribute.

Feel free to contact me off list if you have further questions.
Thanks,
Jane

P.S. Side note: your url of wpacademy.com is okay, but using the 
trademarked name "WordPress" in your product names (WordPress Academy in 
your box images, WordPress Learning Management System all over the site) 
is not. Use of the W logo, also part of the trademark, is restricted per

Jane, thanks for feedback. I feel my best contribution right now is to
focus on this WordPress Help Manual concept.  Yes of course we'll put it in
Wordpress svn but we're not ready for that yet.  My immediate need is for a
project manager, I will be technical lead of sorts.  I could ask my friend
or make inquiries in Philadelphia community here, but I thought posting to
this group and writing to Matt would shortcut the process.

thanks
marc

I think the main disconnect here is that you clearly want to work on a 
Windows-style display system, while most of the docs contributors and 
project leaders don't find that format all that appealing. For all the 
years we've talked about doing an online book-format user manual (to be 
joined by additional manuals for theme developers, core contributors, 
etc), the format that we have aspired to is 
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/, not windows help.

I just went back and reread the past couple of weeks of emails from/to 
you on this list, and can see that others have directed you to the areas 
where contribution is needed currently, and/or wished you luck for 
trying the project on your own since we just aren't really interested in 
taking on as an official thing. It seems like you are sticking hard and 
fast to the idea that your version of documentation is better, and 
that's the only way you want to work on it.

If you want to contribute content to wordpress.org, great, it can go 
into the codex or the nascent handbook easy as pie. If you want to start 
a new project around your theme/plugin combo for your preferred style of 
help display, that's also great, but not something this list can 
facilitate, if no one has volunteered so far. You would be better off 
seeking collaborators on the wp-hackers list, at your local wp meetup 
group, or in the #wordpress IRC channel, where there might be a coder 
interested in working on it. This is not something Automattic or the 
Foundation would hire someone to work on for you. The project leadership 
has endorsed the work being done on codex and handbooks, and that's 
where our focus is for now.
Thanks, Jane

Just a thought but would this form of Windows help system perhaps be 
more suited to a project like Instant WP rather than core?

Jane,

yes you are right, perhaps this is not the right forum for this type of
request

You are also right that I believe that Winhelp / Javahelp is the best
documentation platform, and that I am very stubborn about this.  99% of
commercial software vendors agree with me as do the hundreds of people who
have bought into my platform.  I also get excited at the idea of
context-sensitive help inside WordPress dashboard, call me weird

I may pursue resources you suggest but to be quite frank it's unlikely to
happen without institutional support since I have my own platform that
fills my needs already.  My request was for a project manager, if I could
get that we could likely get things started (and btw there was never any
question of paid development, any technical school or university would be
happy to lend student support to such a venture, but someone still needs to
initiate it)

I also like very much http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ if that is a real option
let's do it.  It can always be converted to Winhelp later when you all see
the light ;), and/or when the platform is ready for prime-time.

I am trying to play with y'all, help me out will you

marc

Many people in this community just disagree. Sometimes we all just have 
to agree to disagree and move on.

> to happen without institutional support 
I understand, but if it's not a passion project for you, it's unlikely 
to get institutional support from an institution that isn't particularly 
interested in it as a format to begin with.

I would also love to have a project manager to oversee our official 
documentation projects... I've been looking for someone to take that on 
for several years, in fact, which is one reason we don't have a full 
awesome set of handbooks already. Again, if no one volunteered to join 
you, you should probably look for a collaborator on a different list. We 
cannot offer you a subsidized project manager for this project.

> I also like very much http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ if that is a real

That is what the support group is working on. They are working on 
content first. The "platform" for the SVN book is just HTML; there's 
nothing special to build.
> It can always be converted to Winhelp later when you all see the light ;)
You are free to convert any freely released content into this format, 
but again, this format is not one that we intend to pursue.
> I am trying to play with y'all, help me out will you
I think multiple people on this list have tried to be helpful and have 
pointed to the various avenues of contribution. If you don't want to 
participate in any of those channels, and just want to do your own 
thing, that's fine. Either way I think everyone agrees that there's more 
than one way to help the community.

Sorry Jane I am now confused.  "that is what the support group is working
on http://svnbook.red-bean.com/"? you mean the Codex people (this list)?   Or
is this a separate group?  I want to be invited to that.



I have stuff to contribute but I am not very interested in working on a
legacy platform, I hope that's clear now, and also I disagree with you
"the SVN book is just HTML", the organization of the topics is
crucial, and also the decision of
whether this is going to context-sensitive help inside the dashboard (which
I strongly recommend and is part of the point of all this IMHO)

There's no special invitation, you just start contributing. The group is 
at http://make.wordpress.org/support. That includes both support forums 
and documentation. The Codex is the existing documentation. The 
handbooks are the new documentation project they are working on there. 
Review the history on the blog there for more information. This list 
(along with the forums list) is semi-deprecated in favor of the blog, 
which is more accessible to potential contributors.

It's been clear from your first email, as has been our disinterest in

Documentation and core ux are two different things. Changing the way 
help is treated in the dashboard would go through the core team. Nacin 
is the release lead, and 3.5 is already in beta, so suggestions for new 
features will probably be taken in January at the beginning of the 3.6 
cycle. But again, there is nothing stopping you from making a plugin 
that does things exactly the way you want them, and releasing that. If 
someone who hasn't contributed to core before wants to make suggestions 
to change the core ux/ui, having a publicly released plugin that does 
what is being suggested will get more attention than someone just coming 
in cold and saying "I think you should do x".

Hi Marc,

Again, I invite you to join us on the User Manual
project<http://make.wordpress.org/support/editor-access/>;
I don't think any of us working on docs currently believe that it is a
perfect system (and we debate it pretty frequently) but it is at least a
place to start.  Currently new users have *nothing to turn* to from
WordPress.org and that is a gap we're all trying to bridge.

You may not agree with it as it stands now, but our aim is to release early
and often, and refine as we go.  Who knows where we'll be when we get to
version 2 and beyond, but for now any help is appreciated, and would place
you at the heart of discussions as to how to make it better as we move
forward.

That or work on a plugin; you're getting a lot of encouragement here to
explore that route as well.

Best of luck,

Just as an FYI, we have a goal! Be done with version 1 by the Summit! :D

We'd love help getting the last pages bashed out. Perfection will come, 
but as with all things, release and then iterate ;)

Ok guys I am on.  Thanks for your patience and encouragement.

Is there any discussion around putting video in there?  Or is that a
post-version 1 thing?

thanks

I have thought this through a bit more and want to make a final
communication, for my own sense of closure.

First I am sorry for being an asshole.  I am also sorry that this
communication has been less fun than it ought to be.  I take full
responsibility for that.

I do however want my proposal on the table without ambiguity.

My proposal is to merge my free documentation at
http://wpacademy.tv/ww3.htminto the Codex, including videos.  In other
words take the best of both,
would need some re-organization of table of contents (including new chapter
"Quick Start"), and redoing my video title slides (or shooting new).  It's
a lot of work, but in the dozens of hours (as opposed to the hundreds of
hours that have gone into this already).  Work for you guys too of course.
But not overwhelming.  More work for me really (unless somebody wants to
take on the videos, I know many of you do videos)

This system would need meet the following requirements (same requirements
as any professional documentation system)
1) Both procedural (tutorials) and reference sections
2) Video
3) Context-sensitive help inside the dashboard (ie the "Edit post" page
link to help topic, the Visual editor links to help topic etc)
4) [optional but highly recommended]  Expanding/collapsing table of
contents, Index and Search functions inside the documentation

That's it.  I understand if that is not a priority, I understand this is
not the vision you have, and if its not your way of working (meritocracy
etc).  I just ask that you accept my seriousness and good intentions, and
forgive the asshole parts.  Communications so far have been clear this is
not your redirection, its fine, but if that should change let me know.

For the rest  I have reviewed http://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/.
Its very good, it just needs IMHO the requirements above, most importantly
procedural sections and video.

Over and out,

marc

Just a quick one before I forget - we talked a whole pile at the summit
this week, and there will be loads of changes and work to be done.

Please catch up here:
http://make.wordpress.org/support/

Some summaries of doc & support specific talks will be posted in the summit
blog and I'll try and remember to send the links here as well.

http://make.wordpress.org/summit/

Right now I need a show of hands of people who regularly work on the codex,
just so we all know who is involved and what they are doing. :)

Hello!

Longtime lurker, first time "caller".

Since I'm in the Codex nearly every day anyway, I usually keep an eye out
for things that need touching up. However, I'm also willing to take a more
active role in contributing to WP-Docs and/or working on the Codex, I'll
just need a little direction about how best to go about it.

I'm already subscribed to the /support p2 among others (and this mailing
list of course), and watched tweets and conversations coming out of the
Summit with interest.

I know Lorelle has a list of pages that need editing, so I'll publish that
(finally!) and we will also pick up the conversation about revamping the
main landing page, which we have touched on before.

Probably it will be best to have a chat about this in the IRC channel if
that works for everyone, or we can also set up a google hangout.

I'm torn between doing that ASAP while we have momentum, and doing that in
a few days to make sure the news gets out. :)

Right now I need a show of hands of people who regularly work on the codex,
just so we all know who is involved and what they are doing. :)

<<< 

 

I'm usually around, monitoring for spammers, defacers, and junkifiers.

 

You'll also see MrMist around doing the same kind of thing!

Hi Andrea,

I'm officially raising my hand!  While my main focus ATM is the user manual
project, I am sure I can help out in the codex from time to time, as there
are quite a few intersections.

Mika - I'll take an admin stick if you're handing them out; I'm wiki-savvy,
but it has been a  while so also rusty.

Cheers,

I&#39;ve been off the grid and catching up. <br><br>We have a variety of tu=
torials on the Codex that are outside of &quot;official documentation,&quot=
; whatever that means. In the past, that meant anything in the Codex that p=
assed the muster of the docs team (or any passer by. :D ). It became repres=
entative of documentation that was &quot;frozen,&quot; linked to from the W=
ordPress Administration Panels. <br>

<br>There is no reason why a tutorial article on such a task would be allow=
ed in the Codex unless the rules have changed. If this is an example usage =
of an existing filter, then it would be an excellent addition to the Codex.=
 <br>

<br>From my two cents worth of input. :D <br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Lorelle<br>

public, store front or web, must meet ADA accessibility guidelines.
Failure to comply could result in fines up to or exceeding $100,000."

There have been lawsuits for many years dealing with this
internationally as well as domestically.

To my understanding, all websites open to the public for commercial
purposes, non-profits, and government agencies (or those working with
the government as a major client) are required to comply, just as
public access buildings are required to comply with ADA laws.

It boils down to titles on links and alts on images, but there is more
to it than just that. WordPress complies on many things but not on the
requirement of links and images. That needs to be changed, and people
need to be aware.

I can get you access to several experts on the subject if you want
their input on this.

Thanks!
