http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Contributions/Newscloud seems to 
mostly be linking off to one web site.  Thoughts on rolling back, etc.?

We should encourage contributors to enhance the Codex article rather than
just slapping links into said articles. Rollback is warranted.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Can we get some codex updates about new media panel?
To: wp-hackers at lists.automattic.com


With WordPress 3.5, media panel started to use backbone.js.
It seems so nice and powerful but it need advanced javascript knowledge.
I believe %99 of WordPress developer community is new to backbone.js and
there is not much guide for newbies. ( Or maybe i couldnt find )
Codex dont have any API explanation or something for backbone.js and sadly
all old filters/actions are just not supporting in wp3.5
like attachment_fields_to_edit (didnt try adding new field. just tried to
remove default ones)
An example:
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/87677/wp3-5-media-gallery-edit-modal-change-captions-to-title
This question was normally simple with old panel but its nearly impossible
for me at the moment.
Can we get some codex updates about new media panel?
