Well? What's the verdict? :D

Thanks for writing this up. If everyone thinks it is ready, let me know and
I'll add it to the table of contents.

Thanks for taking this on. It's much needed!

It's been a few days now and noone has violently objected so I guess it 
is time to add it to the contents. :)

Message-ID: <7b95f7e50908041216p496e29a6v6c9373e4d2e210c9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've added a new, and my first, page to the codex.

Please review and let me know if I need to make any changes.

The article can be read/hacked to bits here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU%27s_VHOST_Constant

I've also added [[Category:New_page_created]] at the bottom of the page.

For anyone familiar with plugin development for WPMU, I'd also like to know
if this page should even be published. Is using the VHOST constant the best
way to determine whether blog addresses use sub-domains or sub-folders? I'll
post this question to the wp-hackers newslist as well. :)

Thanks,

Brent

You might want to remove the Draft marker now that you're ready to 
release the page into the wild.  Replace it with a Copyedit marker if 
you want people to change it. Maybe shift that to the bottom.

I can't really comment on the technical side of WPMU, will leave that to 
the hackers.

True, true. Some keen folk have already added instructions for their

Hi,

I'm writing a page for the wp_insert_post_data filter hook but i'm a bit 
puzzled about the best way to format it. There only appears to be a 
couple of other pages about filter hooks and they don't have any formatting.

Is there a template for this purpose? I'm trying to use the function 
template for it, but it's not quite right really.

Thanks for the warm welcome and feedback Mr Mist. :)
I'll wait to hear back from the hackers. If they say this is the best
method, I'll push the page into the wild with a copyedit marker. I don't
want to go naively publishing a "no-no"!

Well, it's good to see several people jumping on a new document at once. :D

I've deleted the article - whoa! Don't be worried. It had an apostrophe in
the title, which makes a very URL link. I just removed the possessive:

http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU_VHOST_Constant

I also did some quick research and found that there isn't much information
about VHOST or where it appears in the WordPressMU documentation, etc. I
added some references, but we need more.

Key questions:

1. Where is the VHOST constant stored in WordPressMU?
2. Where does the if/else conditional statement go? In the wp-config? In the
Plugin? If a user decides to change from subdomains to subdirectories and
they need help, where are they going to look to make the change?
3. I added "WordPress Plugin and Theme functions" to the list of applicable
uses, but is that true? So many new WordPress Themes are taking on Plugin
functionality.
4. Will this change when MU and "org" merge? Will it be an automatic switch?
5. Any other references that should be added?

It's important to remember that there will be people looking at this
document starting their first MU project, and others who've had it for a
while or had it set up by others, and they don't understand the next step if
they want to make a change. We have to address all their needs.

I'm sure there are more questions, but that's a start. Next? :D

Thanks again for the hard work. This kind of information is critical and
helpful and we really appreciate it.

And it's okay to be a rough draft for a few days. Since the guidelines for
writing drafts only in the username space has been ignored for a while, this
works, too. :D Thanks for letting us know and great work.

I believe the format is as you have seen, and follows the format of the
Template Tags, which is the core format for all such code presentations.

Check out one of the old examples such as
http://codex.wordpress.org/wp_list_pages

Thanks for helping out!!!

Okay so the last edit of "Editing wp-config.php" finally pushed me over 
the edge.  It just seems that no matter how many warnings are splashed 
all over the page, some folk will still try to put their real connection 
information into the Codex page.

So, in a final effort to stop folk doing so, I've abstracted all the 
connection info bits into templates, so it's at least a step removed.

That'll fox 'em.

Tis a work of art, our friend. Work of art!

I thought we'd put a protect on that page. Hmmm. None found.

I recommend we put an administrator block on the page, what do you all
think?

And while we are at it, should I start a thread listing the pages that need
to have a protect put on them that are 1) frequent victims and targets or 2)
locked to the WordPress Administration Panels?

Good work!

Great, I'll update the link from my personal page, that should be the only
link to it. :)

Yes, I found that when looking for info on it! I'm scanning a lot of doc's
at the moment, so will add references in future when I see some relevance.

I'm pretty sure it's stored in the wp-config file, but will check and
include it in the page.

Nice to get a fresh view, the things you don't think of when writing a page
at 3am haha!

The example is for a plugin, I'll include that now.

It's not possible to change from subdomains to subdirectories or vice versa,
so it's undocumented. :)

3. I added "WordPress Plugin and Theme functions" to the list of applicable

I don't think it is true... I'll check and update accordingly though.

Are WPMU plugin specific pages included in the "WordPress Plugin" category?
I wanted to steer clear of anything not WPMU because it's a very MU specific
page.


> 4. Will this change when MU and "org" merge? Will it be an automatic

Again, not sure, but I'll find out.

Very true about different readers, thanks for the advice. :)

When you say next step, do you mean to change the install configuration?
Meaning, change the value of the VHOST constant. As touched on above, this
isn't possible yet so I will include that fact on the page.

Yes, it is critical. I've learnt so much from the codex. :)

My plan was to put a protect on the templates, thus leaving the bulk of 
the page available for updates.  I did try to do this with a couple of 
them, but I don't think the protected status stuck, as my test user 
could still edit them.

I briefly discussed the idea of protecting wp-config over talk with 
MichealH a while back, I think at the time a warning was added instead, 
as protecting could add admin overhead if the page needs changing.  Of 
course, this page is largely static so potentially protecting it is a 
good plan - if it works!

I took a long hard look at the Switching to PHP 5 article and I have some
concerns and advice. I'm making my points public so they will help others
following this mailing list and help us improve the documentation of
WordPress.

The article is well written and clear. This is a critically important
document as it addresses serious concerns many have had about this issue. It
tells the story of PHP 4 and 5 and WordPress, which is great, but
inappropriate for the WordPress Codex documentation. Let me tell you why.

The purpose of such a document is to match intent with content and title.
The title is about switching to PHP 5 in compliance with the move by
WordPress development. People need to know how to switch, and they want to
get to the how, not the why. They get the why. PHP 4 is finished. So how do
they make the move.

What are the questions that are most important to the user? Why would they
click or link to an article about moving to PHP 5? Here are mine right off
the top of my head.

   - How much work does this mean?
   - Will I have to redo my whole site over?
   - Will it break my WordPress Theme?
   - Will it break my WordPress Plugins?
   - What do I have to know to make the move?
   - Can I ask my web host to do it for me or do I have to do it myself?
   - What if my web host doesn't offer PHP 5?
   - What about all the code I use that isn't related to WordPress, like
   gadgets, widgets, Javascripts, and other custom PHP scripts? Will they work?
   - How much time will this take?
   - How much money will this cost?
   - If my host doesn't upgrade, does this mean my WordPress site will break
   in the future or be vulnerable to security exploits if I can't upgrade my
   WordPress?

Look familiar? These are like the questions we ask ourselves every time
there is a development change in WordPress. We want the facts. We want the
step by step instructions. We want reassurance that it won't change things.
Most of all, we want reassurance, and the confidence, that it won't break
things.

Another big concern is the Web Hosting Switch List. Like many similar issues
(and recent discussions), support for such a list requires a lot of work to
maintain. Think timeless documentation.

Asking others to share their "experiences" transitioning opens a door we
don't want to open. It really requires an expert with the passion to
constantly check web host positions and status on this issue. If you have
that, go for it, but realize it will be a page to babysit intimately.

Could you give this another go? I have very specific advice, but I'd like to
see you rip and tear this into a functional document that answers those
questions concisely, giving users confidence in the move, and in WordPress.

When I attend WordCamps and WordPress and blogging events, this topic comes
up all the time. People want answers, and I think we're in a prize place to
finally answer them. You're our rock star. Go for it. :D

Sure I can look at this again.

I agree with the additional questions that need to be answered by the 
page, so will add them in.

The reason why the page gives some background is to serve to address the 
"why bother?" question.  I think it's wise to leave it there.  Most 
people probably get the why but I suspect there are some that don't.

The web hosting switch list is to address the "how?" question.

Both of these were considered points that should be on the page in the 
dev chat, particularly so the "how do I?" list.  I think that to not 
even attempt to guide people in how to make the switch would lose some 
of the strength of the page.

I take your point though that the pages need to be timeless - however, 
the switch to PHP5 will eventually happen to all, so in a way this page 
is less important in that regard than others, which might have a longer 
life span.  I did make the point in the dev chat that I could only add 
web switch information for a couple of hosts, and it was agreed that 
this would be something of an organic beast.

So yes, I'll redraft this out with your specific points in mind and see 
if we can come up with something more meaty.

The re-draft of the page is now up.  I've added the specific questions 
and answers and shifted the background talk to the end where it has less 
prominence.

You'll note that many of the answers are generalist.  This is an 
unfortunate side-effect of the myriad of possibilities out there.  We 
can only really hope to give answers that apply to the majority - for 
which, I think, the switch will be no problem at all.

There will be the odd duff theme or plugin, but I'd expect these to be 
running on outdated platforms in any case.  We can't help everyone ;)

Let me know what you think of the results.

This is great. I didn't mean for you to take my questions literally, as much
as promote a discussion of the questions people will ask, but this is great.


I'd like to tighten it up to Codex standards, though. Would that be okay?
You can change whatever I do, but I'd like to continue to use this as an
example of writing a powerful, tight document for the Codex. One that gets
to the point and answers the needs of the user.

Thanks again for doing this. It is so much better and really will help.
Personally, I don't think the transition is a big deal, but I get this
question all the time, so this is awesome.

Thanks!

I agree I think in many cases it's not a big deal, but there was talk of 
introducing a nag screen into 2.9 or 3.0 and there was a need of this 
codex page to point the inevitable questions to.

Please go ahead and make whichever changes you feel are required and 
then add it to the contents list.  Cheers.

Thanks for letting me edit the Switching to PHP5 article. You did such a
great job, I merely did a little rearranging.

If they go ahead and create a nag screen, this would be the article to link
to. Good point.

For posterity, here are some of the things I did that others should take
into consideration when editing Codex articles in line with the guidelines.

1. Get to the point.
The revised version did a great job introducing the point of the article,
but it left out WordPress and their direct interest in the issue of
switching to PHP 5. I put it right into the first opening paragraph to get
the keywords and point of the article to the top, the first thing people
see.

2. Shrunk the TOC.
Each section header becomes a table of contents bullet, and having too many
makes for clutter. Changed the "FAQ" to a single header section and made
them into a DL list, allowing the eye to see the TOC and move right to the
section with the answers they need. This also helped condense the content.

3. Moved history to the bottom.
Since the history of why make the move is the least important piece of
information the user wants when they get the news that they have to switch,
moving it to the bottom nicely summarized the article and gave more
reference information and support.

NOTE: It might be nice to include links to articles about the changes
between the two versions, especially if they would impact Themes and
Plugins. Another article on how the switch impacts and influences Themes and
Plugins might be nice in the developer section. Hint, hint. :D

4. Changed intent of "Switch List"
To address the concerns previously discussed about timeless articles and
encouraging others to tell their "web hosting stories," I changed the intent
of the switch list to showcase examples of how to make the switch.

5. General Codex Guidelines Compliance.
I just swept through cleaning up the passive voice, smilies, capitalization
issues, made the switch list examples have a consistent style, among a few
other little housekeeping items. The article was so well written, these were
minor tightenings of the belt. Any spelling errors will be mine. :D

I want to thank you again for doing this, and letting me mess around with
your beautiful writing.

Everyone, please take a good look see over this, as I'm sure I messed up
some stuff, and tomorrow, I have a note to put this on the TOC if there are
no more issues with it.

Well done!!!

Cool. Looks good to me. I think it now covers all it needs to do.

Only thing left I think is which categories to put it into?

I'll work on the categories. It's a tough one and I've been thinking about
the options. I'd rather have it in more categories right now then less, but
the TOC will be changing, so I'm debating that, too. :D

I'll get it into the TOC later today. Thanks again. This is so exciting.

Message-ID: <fded39850908101927m246d8e30ld316868c2a3f6d64@mail.gmail.com>

I've added a WPMU "table of contents" with articles I found tagged with the
WPMU category, a first step in cleaning up the table of contents
organization of the Codex.

http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU

I'm sure I missed some articles. I included links to things like the WPMU
functions without listing all of the functions as that is the purpose of
that page, not the main TOC page. I also did not include examples of WPMU
Plugins and Widgets as those aren't educational or technical articles but
examples pointed to from other articles - except where they represented a
technical example.

Could you all go through the Codex and check to see if I missed any key
articles, especially those that will work in the username space?

It's also clear that many of these articles are seriously out of date. For
instance:

1. http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU_Widgets needs to be updated with
instructions on how to widgetize a Plugin or Widget for WPMU
2. http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU_Plugins needs to have instructions on how
to convert a Plugin to WPMU compatibility - not showcase some WPMU Plugins.

Anyone ready to take these on, jump on them and let us know.

If you find articles that need to be in the WPMU table of contents, please
let me know and I'll add them. Also check to ensure I put them in the right
"category" grouping on the TOC. Not sure which articles should really be in
the Development section and which under Advanced. It is always a hard line
to determine.

If this inspires you to write up more WPMU articles, GO FOR IT! :D

Thanks!

Thanks, that looks good and should make it a whole lot easier to find 
things MU related.  I'll have a go at getting some of those pages 
updated and fleshed out over the next couple of days.  We should 
probably also add a link back from the top of Category:WPMU back to that 
page to make it easier to find.

While I'm at it, thanks also to whoever got the red links back for pages 
which don't exist -- that'll make my ongoing work through the WPMU 
function pages a whole lot easier to manage!

I'm TOTALLY thrilled about the red links being back. Thanks for noticing.

The WPMU page should be tagged in that category. I'll double check.

Thanks for attacking these articles. We're desperate to highlight this
area, especially in light of the merger. More and more people are
trying MU out as BuddyPress moves into popularity.

We also need some stuff on BuddyPress and MU. Hint, hint. :D

Thanks!

Lorelle

hi!

I'm really really interested in contributing as well. I have to carve 
out a little time though, and would love some guidance on where to start.

i have worked on some of the pages before - notably parts of upgrading 
WPMU, and the database description.

Andrea, would love to have any help you can offer.

The key things that are needed are to clean up the current articles,
as I do not believe they are relevant any more with the improvements,
and provide simple steps and technical information that reflects the
most common issues for WordPressMU.

It's important that we provide documentation to help the transition to
the combined two versions be as easy as possible, while also educating
the world on BuddyPress and MU.

I'll also talk to Andy about him or someone else adding some
documentation on BuddyPress.

Developer documentation would be extraordinarily helpful as people
need to know how to design WordPress Themes and Plugins in a
WordPressMU world. With the excitement of BuddyPress, I expect there
will also be a lot of interest in developing add-ons for that, as
well.

That's a huge order, but all help is welcome to provide clear
information to help WordPress users of all levels.

Thanks for pitching in!

Lorelle

Right, I've started having a pick through the MU documentation as 
promised and one of the first pages which struck me was this one: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_WPMU.  It seems to start off OK (I 
did a little tidying), but after the first set of bullet points it moves 
on to talking about how to submit bug reports.  While this might be 
helpful to some extent I'm not convinced this page is the right place 
for it.

I didn't compare the instructions on this page to those on the pretty 
comprehensive 'Reporting Bugs' page so I don't know how much crossover 
there is between the two documents.  However it strikes me it might make 
sense to add a new section to the 'Reporting Bugs' page which covers MU 
and move all that stuff over there.  That'll free up the debugging page 
to be more about debugging.

I think it's important that page is clutter-free if the page is, as it 
says, mentioned when MU throws up install errors.

What do people think?

Actually, that page is pretty outdated.

I'm not even sure if it's mentioned when an install fails anymore.

How to force a re-install is still good relevant advice.

After the merge, they will have the same trac, and the same bug 
reporting system.

Aha, I just checked - that link is shown when you get the "No WPMU found 
on this host" message when an upgrade fails.

So basically, that message appears when it finds an install, but can't 
find some aspect of the main blog in the database.

That help any? :D

I guessed the page was outdated given it mentions MU 1.0 as the 
milestone!  When I talked about moving the content I meant moving and 
refreshing it :)

Having thought about it for a while I reckon that for now, while there 
are still two different tracs in use (and given it talks about the 
forums too), it makes sense to have a cleaned up, re-organised version 
of that bug reporting information on its own page.

Out of interest, do we have a time scale for the merge (sorry, I'm not 
all that up on the latest merge news -- I'm not even sure if it's tabled 
for 2.9 or 3.0)?  If it's likely to be really soon then spending too 
much time on pages which will be redundant afterwards is a bit 
pointless.  If it's going to be slightly longer then of course it's all 
good.

Hi all,

http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_a_Static_Front_Page

This page is pretty obsolete and begs for revision. I find many noobs
struggling with that option.

Do you agree?

There's a bold-face paragraph at the top saying that page is not 
applicable as of WordPress 2.1, and it points to
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Reading_SubPanel
which documents how to set your front page. What more do you think 
needs to be done?

Thanks for your reply.

But the "pointing" is not prominent. To wit, it is unobtrusive in a
row of links to "Administration", "Settings" and "Reading", giving an
impression that the link will lead to an explanation page about each
term.

What I feel is that a specific sentence stating explicitly that
"instructions for creating a static front page with post 2.1 versions
can be found at this page" - with a link to that sub-page.

For the sake of cognition-challenged folks like me (dyslexic, if you prefer!)

I have to admit, this is one area of Wordpress which has always confused me.
Although that's more down to behaviour than the Codex documentation. I'll
try to explain.

With the default settings, the homepage displays the most recent n posts,
and uses the home.php template if available, or if not, the index.php
template. So far, so good.

Often, however, you'll want homepage to just be a static content page, and
have the blog as a separate section of the website. For this, you set the
front page to be one of your 'pages'. However, this causes the front page to
use the page.php template instead of the home.php template. This is fine if
you want the page to look the same as all the other static pages, but if you
want a different template for the homepage, you have to create a new
template, give it a name via a PHP comment, and then associate it with the
homepage via the 'Template' dropdown in the right hand nav.  It would seem
to be much more logical to use automatically the home.php template (if it
exists) instead, but this doesn't happen.

The final circumstance is where you want to display the most recent n posts
on the front page, but you also want to have a few paragraphs of intro text
at the top. For this, the ideal would be to use a Wordpress page to hold the
intro text, and then display the n posts beneath (with the number based on
the setting in options-reading.php). However, because The Loop only displays
the page content OR the posts, the only way to achieve this (that I can
find) is to create a new named template, associate that with the page that's
being used as the front page, and then manually define a get_posts()
function call within the template to retrieve the most recent posts.

Does that sound like an accurate assessment of how the various settings
work, or have I missed something?

If I've got it right, this is definitely something that could be better
explained on the Codex, as it took me ages to get my head around this...

And this is what you would put in home.php. It's an either/or situation: 
you can use the drop-down option and pick a page, or you can use 
something specially coded in the form of home.php.

Making a special page template, then setting that page as the home via 
the drop-down accomplishes the same thing, but in more steps. One is 
geared to more novice users.

Please add this to the end of the sentence:

Please go ahead and edit that page as you suggested. Also, Frankie 
could make a new page that further explains how to do that setting, 
and link from this page. The Codex is a Wiki, and is definitely open 
to anyone who has good ideas improving it.

LOL. Be emboldened!

Just remember to follow the guidelines. Also, I would not recommend
creating a new page to tackle this issue but edit the current one to
match the new procedures.

WordPress has taken a strong stance now in NOT supporting "old"
versions and I've taken that to mean no more than a couple steps back,
and certainly not going back beyond 2.6 at this stage. This makes the
old page completely void and yet the title still is valid.

Just change the content within the static page article to reflect
current usage, with all the links in the right places to other
documents. And go for it! :D

Thanks!

I'm working on a list of out-dated docs that I will be posting soon.

I'd love to use home.php as the simpler option. However I can't figure out
how to dynamically insert content into the home.php from a page in the
database, as selecting a page from the drop-down switches to the page.php
templates.  Perhaps it's an usual use-case, but I'd have expected Wordpress
to use the home.php template for both options, and to simply change what
content appears in The Loop.

Anyway, +1 to better documentation for this feature. I'll try to help if I
can.

Message-ID: <C53E8F25-9E30-493F-B2E2-316FF224125E@automattic.com>

Hi everyone. At WordCamp San Francisco at the end of May, Matt  
Mullenweg announced a documentation project that would create a series  
of WordPress handbooks that would complement the Codex. The idea is  
that the Codex, in wiki form, has become difficult to manage, makes it  
hard to find information because there's just so much there, and is  
intimidating to users who are looking for a little guidance and  
instead get a firehose of technical info and links to other articles.  
Inspired by the SVN handbook at http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ the  
WordPress Handbooks are meant to be HTML documents editorially  
controlled/curated using Subversion. Lorelle posted to this list about  
it in January (archive: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2009-January/001862.html 
  ) and it's come up a few times in dev chats and such, so the idea  
shouldn't be too out of the blue.

The plan is to have a handbook for each version (2.7, 2.8, 2.9, etc),  
so instead of using the Codex method of continually updating changes  
and having additional pages dedicated to changes by version (which  
invariably miss a few things), we'll have entire handbooks archived  
for each version of WordPress, with the most current information  
always being "in trunk," just like WordPress itself. In addition,  
handbooks will be available for several types of users: End Users,  
Theme Developers, Plugin Developers, Sys Admins, and CMS users.

The End User Handbook will be the most basic, and will focus on how to  
set up WordPress, use the admin interface, and interact (on a very  
basic level) with theme files and plugins. We wrote a draft of this  
handbook with the release of 2.7 (you'll recognize many chunks of text  
taken from the Codex, as well as original text that describes the then- 
new features), and earlier this year Nikolay Bachiyski took on the  
task of turning it into a repository-ready coded version and setting  
up a Trac to handle patch submission (for suggested text changes).  
It's pretty rough, needs some love re formatting and needs to get a  
once-over for voice and features that have changed since 2.7, but you  
can take a look at it here: http://wordpress.org/docs/
The Trac is here:  http://docs.trac.wordpress.org/ though you'll see  
we haven't started using it yet.

Currently it is just a single HTML file. Once it's up to date and  
pretty, the plan is to a) get the end user handbook included in the WP  
core download and link to sections of it from the help tab (and/ or  
display text there, hopefully), and b) make it possible to print a  
nice PDF of the handbook for those who like to have a printed page  
sitting next to them on their desk while they're learning how to use  
applications.

In the coming week I'll be posting a ticket to the trac for text  
changes to describe the widget redesign stuff, which is already  
written but needs to be added. I'll screencast the process of  
submitting a patch to the handbook and post it to wordpress.tv so  
everyone can see how it's meant to work. Note: you don't need to learn  
Subversion to submit patches! You'd just attach your text to your trac  
ticket (or include it in the trac comment). Only people with commit  
access would need to know Subversion (commit process TBD due to coding  
requirements, etc).

So, what happens next to get this off the ground? As a first step, I'd  
like to assign an editor or two for each of the handbooks (end user,  
theme developer, plugin developer, etc) who will take responsibility  
for collecting the appropriate Codex information and/or writing/ 
gathering new text as needed for first drafts. I'll stay with the end  
user handbook (since I work with the core devs to determine the new  
features, I have access to info early in the dev cycle), and will do  
the once-over for voice consistency so there's a good example before  
people get started, but would like a co-editor to work with moving  
forward. I've also got a volunteer writer/editor, Doug Provencio,  
who's started on an outline for the CMS User Handbook. So for editors  
I'd like to round up someone to work on end user, someone to work with  
Doug on CMS, and 1-2 people each for the theme developer, plugin  
developer and sys admin versions. Editors should be able to create a  
good outline, have excellent writing skills, and be familiar enough  
with the Codex to easily mine it for existing text.

As we assign volunteer editors, I want to start regular IRC chats  
during the first phase of the project, so that more community members  
can advise on what should go into each handbook, review outlines, etc.  
We'll also have a blog set up at http://wphandbook.wordpress.com/ for  
progress reports, questions, asynchronous brainstorming, etc. I'll add  
editors as authors, and it will allow comments from anyone. This list  
will probably be home to chunk of discussion as well.

I'll be posting on the dev blog with this information tomorrow or the  
next day, but wanted to give you, the current documentation crew, the  
word first. It's my hope that having a handful of people working on  
handbooks won't result in an exodus from Codex contribution... the  
Codex is still the definitive living documentation for WordPress, and  
deserves as much love as it can get. That said, I'd love to get  
handbook contributors who are experienced with the Codex. :)

If anyone wants to volunteer as an editor (and can make a commitment  
to work on it over the next couple of months until the final draft is  
out there and available for patching), please email me offlist. For  
general discussion around how to approach the handbook project in  
general, reply to list.

Thanks!
Jane

That page looks like a good start... There are several minor problems:

a) Several broken links -- they are showing up as red -- probably due 
to incorrect page titles (links to "Page" twice and 
"Pretty_Permalinks" once).

b) Error of fact: even WordPress "pages" are still shown using the 
WordPress loop. Everything in WP goes through the loop, with the 
exception of some plugins, which can override certain URLs. But pages 
and posts are both displayed via the Loop.

c) Besides which, on a page like this that is meant for end users, I 
would not advise mentioning the loop at all. It will just confuse 
beginners.

d) Needs a copy edit for spelling, grammar, and style.

I just copied and pasted the loop part from the old page - thought it

Why not delete this page:

Hi

I don't think that this page and the "static front page" page are trying 
to explain the same thing. Static front page is just that, this is about 
the structure of the rest of the blog.

I wish to disagree. If you could read through the page, you'll find it
is irrelevant now. Making a home.php and blog.php are passe.

Moreover I tested it by doing as instructed - except making those
templates. The result was you could access your posts through URl
http://your-site.com/blog/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%/ etc. But when
you try http://your-site.com/blog/, you get a 404 error.

And the procedure doesn't serve any purpose nor is it used by anyone IMHO.

We had better deprecate it.

Sorry, yes.  I agree the content of the page is outdated.  However, the 
reason for the existence of the page was to show how to have stuff in 
the site root with posts in a sub-directory, so I think there is still a 
need for a page to show how to do that.

I have to disagree on the point of home.php being passe. It's still 
quite in use, especially on WPMU sites.

:)

I do agree that it showing how to have content *appear* in a subfolder 
is still relevant.

>========================

Not the file named "home.php" per se, but the instruction to create it
for the purpose aimed at. It alludes to the conflict that creation of
files like home.php and blog.php will cause, owing to their native
connotation in the WordPress core.

Yes. The very fact that home.php exists in themes which is the first
choice for display of blog posts page in the template hierarchy is the
very reason for the specific instruction not to create it for the
purpose discussed.

Hope you are with me!

>===================

Content appearing in a sub-folder is better achieved by the static
front page procedure.

The subject codex page under review is obsolete and unworkable,
perhaps written light years ago in the pre-2.0 era.

Please try to do as per this page and check what you get.

We have two procedures current which help playing around with root and
sub-folder - one with a real folder (WordPress in its own directory),
another with a virtual one (static front page - Home and Blog).

The impugned page I am talking about is to be deprecated.

My case rests!

If there's a better page that details how to do 
"Making_Your_Blog_Appear_in_a_Non-Root_Folder" then maybe this should 
either link to or redirect to that page, as the title of this one is 
fairly descriptive, it'd be a shame for it to just be a deprecated topic 
marker.

Just heard from a WordPress user who is totally frustrated that a post
she thought was protected from public eye wasn't. She is totally
confused about the issues of "private" and "password protected" and
how they work. I realized that we don't have a Codex article on this
that addresses how these things work clearly.

Here are the questions most people probably want to know:

How to protect a single post from public eyes.
What does "password protected" really mean?
How to protect and make private an entire WordPress blog?

Am I missing another key issue?

And who would like to take this on? :D

Thanks,

Lorelle

Very true.  Writing_Posts glances on the subject as it does mention the 
idea of private and password protected, though doesn't expand on it.  I 
guess the definitions within that page could be hyperlinked to distinct 
articles on both topics.

Sorry don't have time to write the new articles just now.  What with a 
new baby and everything else going on, I barely have time to remove all 
the spam.  There was a massive glut of revision spam last night :(

Thanks for grabbing the spam and congrats on the new boo in your life! Wow!

For the rest of us,
http://support.wordpress.com/pages/page-visibility/ is a step in the
right direction but doesn't really clarify much of this.

Okay, so what is the verdict? I'm getting mixed signals here.

Is someone going to update the page so it has value, and maybe add
WordPressMU information to cover that area? There are a TON of
WordPress sites built with old school think that depend upon home.php
and such, so we need to service them.

Updating this, if it is really still of value, is the best bet instead
of just marking it "old."

Thanks.

Good work all!

http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_a_Static_Front_Page

I cleaned up the spelling and formatting to match Codex guidelines and
style, changing it from an essay blog post style to a technical,
step-by-step breakdown.

I'm sure I made some mistakes, so please check it thoroughly, please.

I also left a big note there inviting you all to add some "fun" stuff.
We need two things on the page:

1. Tips for "customizing" the "front page" such as how to have static
content "at the top" and the regular posts below (a combination of
static and not), and some other tips that people tend to want on their
front page. We also have to emphasize that the sidebar doesn't change,
but they might not want the "bloggy" sidebar on the front page, which
means further customization. So we need to tell them how to remove
that sidebar.

2. Theme Troubleshooting - the tip on the nav bar is great. We need
more. You mentioned the top nav bar, but what about the sidebar Pages
links? How about changing those? What if a Theme is set up to
automatically have a static front page without a sidebar. They will
want to know how to get that sidebar back. What else is Theme specific
they need to know if they make a static page in a Theme that might not
know what to do with it?

Have I forgotten anything that we need to address that people think
about when they do this?

Great work all!!!

I made a bit of time and had a stab at this.  Please use it to work into 
a useful article.  Maybe to be linked from the Post / Page sections?

I'll massage it, but I'm thinking right now about the title. Should it
include the words "privacy" and "password" instead of Content
Visibility? Just thinking out loud. We want it to be immediately
identifiable to users.

Also, we need more screenshots. :D

Thanks!

For sure. I wasn't at all sure what to call the article, that's partly 
why it's still under my user area pending move.

I'll look for some screenies of the actions.

The index.php file can already behave that way. home.php and page.php
seem to be meant as specific case exclusions of the default index.php
functionality.

Ok I've uploaded some extra screens now, and attached them to the 
article.  I do not know how to make the text flow nicely around them so 
perhaps you could tweak that?

Have assigned the article to Copyedit status, enjoy!
