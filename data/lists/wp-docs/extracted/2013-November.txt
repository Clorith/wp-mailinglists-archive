Hi listees

Posting this thought here because I lack access to 
http://make.wordpress.org/docs/

The Codex page http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php is 
really long.

I wonder if it should be broken out into basic wp-config and more 
advanced stuff.  Where "basic" would just include things that your 
average user might need.

Currently the "Advanced" stuff occupies the mass of this page, and makes 
it much longer and more daunting looking than it needs to be.

(Also, if we restrict the main bulk of the page to the very basics, it 
could have edit protect enforced on it and prevent people posting their 
database credentials to it.)

Thoughts, etc..

mrmist.

We can continue the discussion there. :)
