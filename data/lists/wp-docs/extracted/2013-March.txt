Hi,

I have just posted a comment at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex_talk:Guidelines#Capitalization_and_formatting_of_WordPress_terms

It deals with the recommended way of formatting of tems and article titles
within article contents. I hope we can improve the stylistic quality of
Codex and make it look like a high-grade documentation. Clear rules are the
first step. Please post your suggestions to the comment page.


Regards.
