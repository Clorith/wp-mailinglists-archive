==================

Though Extend is not a directory of plugins, it is searchable by tags.
And an added benefit to the users is that the plugin management
page of the blog admin gets a prompt when an activated plugin is
updated. This is a major advantage for netsloths like me! Besides, it
integrates into other sections of wp.org site, thus making it a single
window for users.

Hence please host your plugins in the Extend area as a consideration
for the geekily-challenged folks like me!

Thanks and regards,

I've made a new Codex page that you may be interested in -- covers the 
highlights of how to migrate plugins and themes from 2.1 to 2.2, 2.3, 
and the upcoming 2.5, with links to earlier articles on how to migrate 
from 1.2 to 1.5, and 2.0 to 2.1.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Migrating_Plugins_and_Themes

I also updated previous links on the Plugins Resources and Templates 
pages, as well as Developer Documentation, to point to this article 
rather than the earlier "Migrating to 2.1" article.

Anyway... It's a Wiki -- feel free to add/clarify/edit/fix.

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex license: CC better than GPL?
Message-ID: <1204030142.327.84.camel@localhost>

Hi all,

I wonder why the Codex is under the GPL. I know similar questions have
been discussed before on this list. But, as far as I know, the issue GPL
vs. CC has not been discussed. I also know that there are good reasons
for choosing the GPL, e.g. to be license-compliant with WP itself.

Anyway, I think that a code license such as the GPL is not well-suited
for documentary work. (I think this is obvious enough, so I don't
explain it further. But of course, we can discuss this. There are also
many related discussions to be found on the web.)

In my opinion, the CC-BY-SA license is equivalent to the intention of
the GPL, and it's a much better, because more precise and specific
license for a work such as the WP Codex.

Therefore, I'm proposing to relicense the Codex to the CC-BY-SA. Of
course, one cannot simply relicense other people's work. All
contributors of non-trivial content would have to agree, and the content
of those who didn't agree, would have to be removed.

Still, I think this is possible. Wikipedia itself had a similar problem
when they realized that they are stuck with the GFDL. And as far as I
know, Wikimedia has been able to perform a license update, despite the
fact that Wikipedia has *many* more contributors than the WP codex.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia#Content_and_internal_structure
http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update

What do you think, especially the main contributors?

NB: I'm not a lawyer, and although I'm quite familiar with copyright
legislations, I'm not at all an expert.

By the way, you might wonder why I'm proposing this; the reason is that
we are currently working on a new German documentation, and the GPL is
very bad to handle questions like translatabilty, or compatibility with
documentary work in other legislations than the US.


Best regards,
Alex

+1 for that.

You've got my permission to convert any contributions I've made to Codex to 
the CC-BY-SA license.

How attribution is done isn't defined by the CC licenses, so what do
we mean by attribution?

Being able to incorporate the documentation into WordPress itself
seems desirable. That isn't possible with a CC license.

When you start to try and unravel all of the issues, public domain
quickly becomes the only real option for a high collaborative, highly
flexible project. Consider Tantik and Microformats recent change to
this:

There is some documentation on code flow in the Codex -- at least an 
outline of what happens when you visit a non-admin blog page:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/Query_Overview

Also, David House started another page to describe code flow, but 
hasn't updated it for a year, so I don't know what his plans are:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/User:DavidHouse/Wordpress_Code_Flow
I think it was in response to this support request:
   http://wordpress.org/support/topic/33788

If you can describe what kind of other code flow you would like to see 
that would be useful, maybe you can add it to the To Do document:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/JHodgdon/Dev_Doc_To_Dos

You allude to several issues, it'd be good to hear specifics of what a 
GPL license prevents us from doing.

People seem to be able to translate our GPL code just fine, what's the 
issues with translating the Codex?

A few more thoughts here...

Yes, there is some barrier to becoming familiar with the core 
WordPress code base, but that is true in any large-ish open-source 
project. If you want to participate in the role of a core developer or 
bug patcher in any open-source project, you have to be willing to read 
source code. Is that a problem? I don't think so -- only people who 
have familiarized themselves with the core source code and who can 
read reasonably well-written code in the project's language should be 
proposing changes to it, and yes, it does take time to familiarize 
yourself with any fairly large code base. The code of WordPress is 
written in a pretty clear manner, in my opinion... It could be better 
documented (there are efforts underway to add PHP Doc headers to all 
the functions, another good SoC project), but if you can read PHP, I 
don't think it's difficult to figure out what any individual function 
does by reading the code.

Also, if you have a reasonable IDE on hand (such as Eclipse), if there 
are functions called that you are unfamiliar with, it's pretty easy to 
search for them and find out what they do.

My thought when I wrote the Query Overview page was to present a road 
map to how visitor-facing pages are generated, which I didn't think 
was obvious, even after spending the time to read through the code in 
detail. I thought that at least it would give someone a head start (at 
least tell them where in the source code to read to find more details).

The reason I haven't made something like Query Overview to explain 
what the admin pages do, is that I think it's a lot clearer there: you 
visit a particular admin page URL, and that tells you which source 
file is being used to generate that page. Then go read that file to 
see what it does.

My concern on making a document like what you describe, which goes 
into great detail on the flow, functions, hooks, etc., is that my 
experience in years as a professional software developer has been that 
the code itself is the only reliable "documentation" of what the code 
is doing in detail. Any attempt at having outside documentation 
explaining the code may be fine at the moment it's written, then 
quickly goes out of date.

Thoughts?

The deed says: "You must attribute the work in the manner specified by
the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they
endorse you or your use of the work)."

I think this means it will be up to us, in this case the Codex
contributors, to define this. I would do this as follows: In each
article's history, the authors are listed anyway. An attribution could
be defined as a link to the page's version history with all authors,
along with the date of retrieving the page content. For example (in a
derivate work):

-------------------

Contents retrieved from <page> on February 25th, 2008 at 9:33am

This is an interesting question: Is the CC (in this case: BY-SA)
compatible with the GPL?

FSF says no [1], but they don't explain why. In my opinion, the problem
is not so much -- as they suggest -- that there is confusion about which
license it is in particular. The actual problem seems for me to be the
question of attribution: As the specific kind of attribution is to be
determined by the author of a CC'd work, the license cannot be generally
considered GPL compatible, for same reasons as the original BSD license
is not GPL compatible because of the advertising clause[2].

Others also say no[3], and have good arguments why CC BY-SA is generally
to be considered unfree. A important point seems to be the possibility
of revocation (if I understand it correctly). I can't say if this is
true, and how this issue could be overcome, but I'm sure there is a way.
Btw, note that [3] is from April 2005 and refers to CC BY-SA 2.0. It
would be interesting how the 3.0 series of the CCs get along with GPLv3.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find qualified opinions on that.

But regardless of these, there are countless discussions (search for *CC
GPL compatible* or similar), in how far CC and GPL are compatible. Many
voices don't see the problem, and want to see CC and GPL compatible. For
example a number of iconsets and themes are CC'd (as this is a suitable
license for this sort of work), but -- given that CC and GPL are
incompatible -- cannot be shipped with the target application. I think
the CC vs. GPL issue is one of the most important questions of
OpenSource licensing today.

I agree that Public Domain is very open and flexible, but you won't find
too many people who are willing to provide their work PD. ;) Besides, PD
is not legally possible in a number of jurisdictions, including Germany
and France. However, MIT or BSD license are also good choices, similar
to PD.

(By the way, I wasn't able to find out whether WordPress itself is
licensed "GPLv2 only" or "GPLv2 or later". The readme.html only says:
"WordPress is released under the GPL (see license.txt)", and license.txt
is the GPL v2. I wonder if this is intentional, or Matt just forgot to
include the precise statement.)

Alex

license it is in particular. The actual problem seems for me to be the
question of attribution: As the specific kind of attribution is to be
determined by the author of a CC'd work, the license cannot be generally
considered GPL compatible, for same reasons as the original BSD license
is not GPL compatible because of the advertising clause[2].

Others also say no[3], and have good arguments why CC BY-SA is generally
to be considered unfree. A important point seems to be the possibility
of revocation (if I understand it correctly). I can't say if this is
true, and how this issue could be overcome, but I'm sure there is a way.
Btw, note that [3] is from April 2005 and refers to CC BY-SA 2.0. It
would be interesting how the 3.0 series of the CCs get along with GPLv3.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find qualified opinions on that.

But regardless of these, there are countless discussions (search for *CC
GPL compatible* or similar), in how far CC and GPL are compatible. Many
voices don't see the problem, and want to see CC and GPL compatible. For
example a number of iconsets and themes are CC'd (as this is a suitable
license for this sort of work), but -- given that CC and GPL are
incompatible -- cannot be shipped with the target application. I think
the CC vs. GPL issue is one of the most important questions of
OpenSource licensing today.

I agree that Public Domain is very open and flexible, but you won't find
too many people who are willing to provide their work PD. ;) Besides, PD
is not legally possible in a number of jurisdictions, including Germany
and France. However, MIT or BSD license are also good choices, similar
to PD.

(By the way, I wasn't able to find out whether WordPress itself is
licensed "GPLv2 only" or "GPLv2 or later". The readme.html only says:
"WordPress is released under the GPL (see license.txt)", and license.txt
is the GPL v2. I wonder if this is intentional, or Matt just forgot to
include the precise statement.)

My problem with the GPL for documentary work is basically that most of
the license is about code, and these sections are irrelevant to
documentations and similar work -- you could as well omit them. What
would be left is very vague about the way you can use the licensed work,
because it doesn't talk about ideas and concepts, but *only* about code
(or text, if you will).

In short terms: the GPL protects the literal code, but a translation
contains no literal parts of the original -- only its ideas and
concepts. It is questionable in how far a translation is a derivative
work, and you would have decide it for each piece of work. This is prone
to cause legal confusion. The CC licenses however also protect (to a
certain extent) the idea behind a work, therefore the translations
licensing issue is easier to solve with a CC license. (IMHO, IANAL.)

Short story long:

------ BEGIN veeeeery lengthy argumentation ------

An intellectual work consist of ideas and concepts as well as literal
expression/manifestation of these ideas and concepts. This is what
(software) code and (documentary) text have in commom. But there are
significant differences, and one of them is translation, or, in software
terms, reimplementation.

As for human language works such as a documentation, a translation is
still very close to the original work, because it is usually translated
paragraph by paragraph. But "translating" software takes much more, and
the derivative character of the outcome is very questionable. For
example: Would a Java reimplementation of WordPress be a derivative
work? One might think so, but the final implementation would not at all
look similar to the original work, hence the copyright would not apply
to it, nor would the GPL, because no WordPress code is in the new work.

Of course, software also consists of ideas and concepts to a large
extent, the actual coding is a rather small part of software
development. However, the GPL refers only to the code (or applied to
documentation: the mere text).

A "translation" of code, namely a reimplementation in a different
programming language, is almost a complete redesign, and it's not
self-evident that the result is a derived work. Again, I argue that this
is rather an "inspired" work, and the intellectual property dimension is
a patent-like rather than a copyright-like. Therefore, you will usually
not be able to claim a copyright infringement on a reverse-engineered
and reimplemented application.

This is why the GPL doesn't talk about reimplementations and
"translations" -- they are usually no derivative works. But considering
translations of a documentation, the term "derivative work" is too
vague, because the outcome does in fact not contain any explicit portion
of the original work -- exept the ideas, but these are not necessarily
protected by copyright.

I think that the CC licenses handle this translation issue better,
because they explicitly say that translations are derivative works.

The GPL does not regard translations/reimplementations, which is ok for
software, because a reimplementation is usually no longer a derivate
work, but applied to documentary work, it is not so clear and might
cause legal confusion. 

You could now say, CC also cannot protect ideas beyond copyright. But
this is not true: the CC (here: BY-SA) is a license, and as it grants
certain rights based on a contract, it can demand compliance with almost
arbitrary conditions -- far beyond copyright. Other licenses do the
same, e.g. concerning patents. Only the GPL explicitly doesn't
("Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope."), because of the
aforementioned reasons.

Hope all this is halfway comprehensible; but I think one should get the
general idea.

------ END veeeeery lengthy argumentation ------

So much for the translations and "derivative works" issues, but there
are others, too: What is "file" in a documentation? The entire work, a
chapter, a page? The GPL requires "modified files to carry prominent
notices". I agree that this is not impossible, e.g. with the page
history in a Wiki. But with a flexible CC attribution statement, one it
would be easier to create complex derivates (e.g. a translation of
larger Codex parts).

Another argument pro-CC is that documentary and similar works are
nowadays often CC'd. (Kind of circular reasoning, I know.) Therefore, if
you have to choose between two similar, but incompatible licenses, you
might want to chose the one which is more common in area you work in. 

So, if you want to distribute a GPL'd WordPress package along with a
CC'd documentation, you can do so without problems, as both licenses
allow the "mere aggregation" with works under different licenses. A
documentation can technically not be a derivative work of a piece of
software, and vice versa. (The type of influence is rather that you have
*learnt* from the original work, which is a separate provision of Free
Software, and it doesn't require to adapt the license.)

I admit that this is not so clear in cases where code snippets are
incorporated in the documentation; but in most cases, these are trivial
pieces (which you can treat as a quotation), and they mostly consist not
of the original code, but of usage examples made up by the documentation
author.

However, back on topic, if you aggregate content of the same kind, you
might reach a point where you need to merge them beyond mere
aggregation, and then your licenses must be compatible.

After all, I won't deny that the GPL is an acceptable license for the
Codex. On the other hand, there are serious drawbacks, and I see a
strong argument for CC licensing. Maybe dual-licensing would make sense.

> People seem to be able to translate our GPL code just fine, what's the 
> issues with translating the Codex?

In my opinion, translating software messages is actually a code
contribution. Textual messages are a part of the user interface, hence
the GPL makes sense here. Besides, the translation templates are
definitely a derivative work, they are derived from the source, they
contain parts of the code, and they make no sense without the
application.

I haven't tested it yet, but I saw the code, and it looks very
promising! I'll have a proper test the next days and then flood Trac. ;)

Alex

Well if you think of the intention, I think licensing the translations 
the same as the Codex and WordPress itself would fit very much within 
what the ultimate goal is for the Codex, which is to have a large body 
of work that is available under the same terms as WordPress itself and 
could, if needed, be included directly with the WordPress distribution.

I sent this at the start of the conversation but it appears to have not made
it to the mailing list. Here is my second attempt:

I contacted Jonathan Bailey of Plagiarism Today, an expert on this subject,
and he recommends both GPL and Creative Commons-BY-SA.  Here is his
response, used with permission, that explains why.

- - -
Lorelle,

The person is, for the most part, completely right.

The GPL license was never and is not designed for written words. That
is why they created the GNU Free Document License for reference
materials. However, there is a major issue with the GFDL in that it is
not actually compatible with the GPL. You can't port code from or into
it from GPL sources.

It's a classic "head desk" moment. The license written to solve the
problem of the GPL not working well with the written word and artistic
creations is incompatible with with the GPL. The problem is that the
GPL is targeted at software and many of the notions and concepts
covered in GPL don't apply to creative works (especially references to
patents) and the GPL doesn't cover many problems that arise with
written works, such as translations.

What I'll guess is that the people behind the codex decided it was
best to use an imperfect license that was compatible than something
targeted at written works but couldn't play with GPL code. It's an
inelegant solution that causes problems, such as the translation
issue, but can head off others such as the inclusion of codex writing
in WP files.

Wikimedia has been trying to get away from the GFDL due to
compatibility issues with the license and is converting to Creative
Commons BY-SA. It is "GPLesque" in that it has many of the same
principles, but is not compatible with GPL code due to attribution
requirements and other specifics that are different between the GPL
and the CC license.

However, to do that, they are having to obtain changes to the GFDL,
make the transition possible. Otherwise, they'd only be able to
license new material.

This is what we call a license clusterf!@#$ and it was actually created
by the open source movement. I can name almost a dozen "open" licenses
that are not compatible with one another or only have limited
compatibility. There is no easy way out of this and the only "elegant"
solution is dual licensing.

What you would do in this case is license the codex both under the GPL
and under the CC license. If someone wanted to use it in GPL code,
they could use that license, if they wanted to use it in a manner
consistent with CC, they could. That keeps compatibility high and lets
people like Alex do what they have to.

The problem is applying it. I just registered for an account and
didn't sign any actual TOS. I would, theoretically, own the rights to
anything I submit as I technically didn't even agree to the GPL.
Still, since there are mentions of the GPL on the site, I won't play
that card but I will say that I only agreed to the GPL and that it
would be impossible for the site to do a blanket relicensing of the
content posted without permission from the rights holders.

This issue isn't as simply resolved as changing the licensing on the
home page. Since the GPL and CC license are not compatible, you can't
move content from one to the other without authorization. Though there
will likely soon be a means to transfer GFDL licensed material to CC,
it is unlikely that GPL will be able to.

In short, this might be a solution that you're just stuck with. Sure,
there are better ways to handle it, but the nature of copyright
licensing is that, once you agree to something, it pretty much stays
that way.

Anyway, that is all I have. I hope that it helps!

Jonathan Bailey
Site: http://www.plagiarismtoday.com

Both would cover the WordPress as program documentation usage, the Codex as
manual, and editorial/technical content for usage (tips, tutorials, etc.).

Before doing anything, we need legal language on this for inclusion, which I
recommend Matt or Toni get from the WordPress Lawyer or I can get a
recommendation from Jonathan.

This doesn't have to be a complicated change. We need to cover the multiple
uses and can do so easily with little stress.

1. Change the copyright and license statements on appropriate pages on the
Codex.
2. Send an email announcement to everyone who contributed (or a blanket to
all registered "members" on the Codex) or just make a public announcement
via all the normal WordPress outlets.
3. Add a clear agreement/TOS that must be checked for approval and
acceptance when registering to edit the Codex.

Do we have an accessible email list of everyone whose "registered" for the
Codex? Going public with this would create a huge...shall we call it
"discussion"...on the issue. Which could be good if we don't put all our
energy on the naysayers.

Then we wait for copyright to catch up with the WordPress Codex. I would
hate for the Codex to become the legal suit that would bring about faster
changes in the copyright and licensing laws. So CYA with both might be the
best conservative option.

First, thank you very much for your research, and also many thanks to
Jonathan for his enlightening arguments!

In my opinion, dual-licensing seems to be a good idea -- provided that
all involved parties agree. I'd love to know what the other contributors
and WP devs think.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any more recent documents than the
ones in that article. But I also agree now that GPL and CC-BY-SA are
legally incompatible. Therefore, the option of a license migration seems
no longer to be a good idea to me, I rather opt for a dual-licensing
solution.

Not necessarily. First, the GPL also requires you to give detailed
attribution to contributions and modifications ("You must cause the
modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the
files and the date of any change.", GPLv2, 1 a)). And as for the CC
attribution, I already proposed in a previous e-mail a way to do this
for the Codex without requiring to list every single contributor.

I don't think that is necessarily true, but that raises the most
interesting questions to consider any changes.  How many authors are
there of the codex, and do a reasonable number of authors represent
almost all of the work.

There are ways around that in each of those jurisdictions. I believe
either creativecommons.org have completed work in this area, or are
currently working on it.

WordPress is licensed GPL version 2, because as you say the license
doesnt' have a or later clause.

GPL is a license of sources, whereas as, as I suggested, CC licenses
depending on how the attribution is required impacts the experience of
the derivative work.


Dual licensing seems like a pretty good compromise, but it is hard for
me to get excited about this type of discussion, because any
resolution is very labor intensive,

Aside. That isn't completely true. License proliferation predates the
open source movement, and I think has greatly improved since the Open
Source Initiative started. Also the Free Software Foundation does a
fantastic job of documenting the incompatibilities, and providing a
small set of licenses that have huge quantities of work under them.

Message-ID: <fded39850802271705r429c623n45e8d675ec82e7ba@mail.gmail.com>

I thought the issue of making the Codex print friendly had been resolved a
long time ago, but if memory serves, that was before the "new" look applied
a year or so ago when the Codex was integrated into the Org structure. Now,
http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/02/23/printer-friendly-codex/this
isn't a good thing.

I'm trying to track down who in Automattic controls the design and look of
the Codex. I have a huge list, as I'm sure others do, of things that have to
be changed to improve the functionality and usability of the Codex, but
let's start small and get the Codex a decent print.css stylesheet first.
