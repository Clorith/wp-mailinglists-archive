Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress Themes and the Sponsored Themes Issue
Message-ID: <4695CE18.4020304@cameraontheroad.com>

With the WordPress Theme Viewer official and working well for the past 
year, the WordPress Themes List on the Codex is fairly obsolete. There 
are now over 4,000 WordPress Themes and the Codex list doesn't even come 
close. Now that Matt has declared sponsored WordPress Themes to be 
removed from the WordPress Theme Viewer, a declaration which I assume 
means no WordPress endorsement or permission for featuring sponsored 
WordPress Themes, who wants to be the one to go through the Codex list 
looking for sponsored Themes? Hmmm?

I didn't think so.

Matt's deadline is July 20ish. I'd like to have a few days of 
discussion, unless we are all suddenly unanimous on this.

I propose we remove/redirect the Codex Theme list to the WordPress Theme 
Viewer. A summary and link directing the reader to the Viewer and 
related Theme information and resources works as a replacement for the 
main page. This will take the burden away of maintaining the pages and 
remove the issue of removing sponsored Themes.

What say you all?

Wow that sucks. A lot of nice (originally) custom WP themes are coming 
from DP, SP, TF and other forums where folks are buying custom themes at 
near bottom dollar prices to slap sponsor links on them, then releasing 
them for free... So much for that then I guess.. Unless there's a way 
for folks visiting WordPress.org and such, to be told where to go to get 
nice custom WP themes just because they have sponsor links on them.. hmm..

As for your whole discussion, I wouldn't know where to start sigh. It's 
a HUGE task sigh. As for the two that someone bought off of me, then 
slapped sponsor links on them.. I wonder if I could just download them, 
remove sponsor links and resubmit them eh? LOL!..

I did this one up, same guy bought it, and did same thing with it. :( 
Slapped sponsor links on it.

I did go back through all the themes a number of months ago,  tested the
links, and deleted any dead wood.  Also, any themes ADDED to the theme
articles have been required to disclose license information and whether the
theme is sponsored--this has been strictly enforced.

If discussion means whether sponsored themes should be allowed in Codex,
then I'd say allow them as long as they are noted as sponsored.  If Matt's
decree means no sponsored themes in Codex, then the discussion seems to be
simply, who wants to delete the Themes on July 20th.

The discussion is not about whether or not to have sponsored Themes on 
the Codex. The issue is what to do with the Codex WordPress Themes list 
now that the WordPress Themes Viewer is up and running and officially 
official. They can handle the "disposal" and checking of all sponsored 
Themes. That's not our responsibility on the documentation team.

Thanks, Michael, for updating all those links and for going through the 
list. That's wonderful.

What we need to discuss is what to do with the list. I'm recommending we 
list Theme resources and direct readers to the Viewer and remove all the 
individual Theme links to save wear and tear on volunteers. Other ideas? 
Yeahs? Nays?

I haven't been tracking along thoroughly, but what you're  
recommending seems like a sound idea.

If the Themes Viewer is "official" - I think there is no reason for
duplicating the listing.
(although I haven't been involved very much with the Codex lately...)

I think this is a good idea. Another thing to remove links to is 
wordpress.org/extend/themes, since I think that is also obselete.

A big culprit for directing people to lots and lots of places is
     http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes
Are you proposing to take that list of resources out of "Using Themes" 
and putting it in "Themes" instead? That sounds like an OK plan. 
Maintaining the list of resources in two places sounds like a bad idea 
to me.

It also seems a little pointless to have the "themes" article just 
contain a short list of resources. Maybe "Themes" should be deleted, 
or better yet, "Using Themes" content could be put into "Themes" and 
"Using Themes" could be deleted?

Good points, Jennifer. This could all redirect to Using Themes.

And Moshu, we miss you! Hope all is well.

Subject: [wp-docs] Copyright Violations on Codex
Message-ID: <4699497B.8080705@cameraontheroad.com>

It has been brought to my attention that there are copyright violations 
on the WordPress Codex. I have no specifics and will be seeking them, 
but has anyone found any?

A copyright violation would be the use of content published on the Codex 
without permission of the original owner. When someone logs in and 
registers, we need to make sure that they agree to all of our policies 
and copyrights - we need to check into that to make sure it is updated 
and valid.

Any ideas of what content might be in question?

Sorry, it just doesn't make sense for me.
If "somebody" brought to your attention this violation - the person should
be more specific.
It would be insane that _we_ go through the Codex trying to figure out what
is copyright violation, don't you think? Let those who complain find them.
Isn't that the NORMAL way?

I am not willing to spend even one second on thinking "what content might be
in question".

I suggest in the future you come to the list with facts - otherwise don't
spam the list.

Moshu,

I wasn't spamming the list. I am waiting for specifics. You should know 
me better than that.

If there has been an issue and I and others missed hearing about it, now 
is the time to get it resolved. This is also a warning to be aware of 
copyright violation issues and to stomp them out when we find them so 
the Codex can remain..."clean".

As soon as I get more specific information, then we will deal with it. 
In the interim, let's keep the Codex controversy free.

Thanks,

Lorelle

It's silly to have the list in two separately maintained places, and the 
theme viewer is a better interface anyway. Sponsored themes should not 
be anywhere on wordpress.org, including the Codex.
