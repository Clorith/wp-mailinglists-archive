Interestingly, the page http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes/Theme_List
has had almost 100,000 views per month for the last 3 months.

The page http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page has only seen approximately
70,000 view per month.

That according to the views tracked via
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Popularpages.

Guess that 30,000 difference in traffic is coming from the link on
http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/.

This is *very* classy design.

One concern that I have is the editing tools in the sidebar.  I'm using a
similar layout for a Mediawiki install for Katrina victims trying to
navigate the bureaucratic morass of FEMA benefits (www.femaanswers.org).

Though much cleaner and easier on the eyes than the default Mediawiki
theme (Monobook), I'm finding that having the editing tools across the top
of each article, as the Monobook theme does, feels a bit more intuitive
than having them in the navigation panel on the side, and enforces a
useful separation of functionality.

Subject: [wp-docs] GPL requirement on Writing_a_Plugin
Message-ID: <F1B29964D38EC6E6C2BB8CAD@[192.168.1.119]>

Since I had last read the "Writing a Plugin" page...

http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin

...almost a year ago, the following sentence has been added to the "Plugin 
File Structure" section:

   You do not need to license your plugin under the terms of the GPL;
   but any license you choose to use <strong>must</strong> be
   compatible with the GPL.

I think this is incorrect. Probably, it is a misunderstanding from the GPL 
FAQ that addresses how programs with restrictive license plug-ins cannot be 
distributed as a combined work.

Obviously, if a person writes a plug-in from scratch (as opposed to using 
existing GPL, or otherwise, licensed code) and uses the public WordPress 
API, the plug-in copyright rests completely with the author and the GPL 
doesn't have any avenue to impel the author to license the plug-in under 
GPL, or any other license. Obviously, the author could not combine the 
plug-in with WordPress and distribute them together, since that would 
violate the WordPress GPL license for distribution. But, the author could 
distribute the plug-in separately under any license, and licensed users 
could install the plug-in on their WordPress installation, creating a 
"combined work" for their own use, within the WordPress GPL license.

I think it would be less grating to generous authors to encourage them to 
distribute their plug-in under the GPL or other open-source licenses, 
rather than try and force them to do so. Trying to force generosity might 
be taken the wrong way. I know that's the way I felt when I saw the new 
sentence. Encouraging GPL licensing by appealing to authors' 
community-minded generosity and via other perks (like hosting on 
wp-plugins.org) might come across better, and be more accurate.

Most plugins must use a GPL-compatible license.  From the GPL FAQ:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLAndPlugins

      "It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins. If the program
      uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are
      separate programs, so the license for the main program makes no
      requirements for them.

      If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function
      calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form
      a single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the
      main program and the plug-ins. This means the plug-ins must be
      released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license,
      and that the terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins
      are distributed.

      If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication
      between them is limited to invoking the `main' function of the
      plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a
      borderline case. "

It is my understanding of this FAQ that most WordPress plugins are 
covered by the second paragraph.  Most plugins use the $wpdb object, and 
make use of template tags and other internal structures.  In this way, 
they are not functional on their own.  Since they require the GPL'ed 
product to function, and since they share data structures with the 
GPL'ed program, they too are bound by the terms of the GPL.

If someone writes a plugin that does not use _any_ internal WordPress 
functions or objects, they could then license their plugin however they 
wish.  For example, David Pankhurst's utopia1.php, available when you 
purchase his "Top Ten Search Optimization Tricks for WordPress" book, 
(apparently) does not use any internal WordPress functions or data (so I 
am told -- I have not looked at the code).

See here for additional info on this:

I think it's important not to abuse the GPL, nor to encourage abuses of 
it.  Licensing issues can become murky for armchair legal practitioners. 
  I think the sentence against which you are railing is an appropriate 
one, and that it should remain.

I will write the upgrade docs that are needed.
Problem is that they won't be 1-2-3.
You cannot cover what needs to be done in one small paragraph and I'd 
rather do it once and properly in my time than have to rush one out when 
the complaints come in.
If you have written or are writing such docs for the next WP release, 
say so now please so there is no duplication of work.

We need a "What's New in WordPress 1.6" document similar to "What's New
in Gnome".  People love these things.

http://www.gnome.org/start/2.10/notes/rnwhatsnew.html

The doc should follow 1.6 development and be updated as needed.  Once
1.6 is ready for release, "What's New" can become part of the release
notes.

Matt, Owen, Donncha, Andy, and I have written quite a bit about 1.6 on
our blogs.  Those posts could be used to seed "What's New".

Really?  I mean, I expect that b2->1.6 wouldn't work, but 1.0.1 or 1.2?

What extra steps need to take place to perform these upgrades?  Are we 
talking about templates/themes?  I'm curious, not skeptical.

I know a lot of effort has been made to produce instructions for 
commonly-requested WordPress functions, but don't these very basic 
things (installing, upgrading) merit specific, directed, illustrated, 
hand-holding documentation, perhaps also without the burden of the Codex 
navigation?  Certainly, the download page should link to such a set of 
instructions, and such a set of instructions could introduce the Codex 
resource upon completion.

I would advise:
b2.x > 1.0.2
1.0.2 > 1.2.2
1.2.2 > 1.5.2
 >1.6

I have no idea of the db structure as such, but I know the above steps 
work - I've both done them and told others how to do them. I'd rather an 
extra step to be absolutely certain not to break a blog.
If anyone wants to disprove that path, supply me with a b2 blog complete 
with posts, comments and a custom theme. I'll then do the work.

I posted to Hackers recently about a 1.5.2 blog that will not complete 
on upgrade. 60meg+ db of JUST posts/comments. No stats, no junk, just 
blog stuff.

That's why I have my pages, and why 10,000 hits have been recorded so 
far this month. I have long said that Codex for people who are unsure is 
not a good thing. It IS a good thing for the confident, the coders, the 
interested readers, but for problems I think it is poor. This isn't a 
new view of mine, it's something I have said for a long time.

The download needs clear directions, yes. Directions that is to "How to 
Upgrade" - I don't RTFM, the majority of people who are reading this 
probably don't either, but we are the tiny minority and to be honest the 
people that will talk about this more in hackers are not the people 
helping to mend blogs in the forums. They need the M.
I would love to think it would happen - it will not.
I - with the assiatnce of many testers - wrote the 1.2 > 1.5 guide, yet 
this was what was in the download:

"Upgrading

Before you upgrade anything, make sure you have backup copies of any 
files you may have modified such as index.php.
Upgrading from any previous WordPress to 1.5:

    1. Delete your old WP files, saving ones you've modified
    2. Upload the new files
    3. Point your browser to /wp-admin/upgrade.php
    4. You wanted more, perhaps? That's it!"

It was briefly mentioned that a Codex page may exist.
I asked many times for the guide to be pointed at - it was not given 
prominence.
In these 'Web2.0' days, instructions of the like I will produce are not 
welcome - because they are not "1 - 2 - there is no 3 :) :) :)" type.

I want to start versioning the DB.  This will avoid running the deslash
code unless we are really upgrading from 1.2.x or older.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1791

This won't help upgrades from 1.2.x, but at least we won't suck when
upgrading from 1.5.x and later.

Moshu is a highly regarded member of the support forums and someone I 
respect.

You didn't mention what ?

You do 1/10th of the support help that Moshu and maybe, just maybe you 
might be listened to.

And quit using HTML mail.

I recommend a modification to the Forum search function to prevent people
from searching for 1.6 if the mere mention of the number is enough to make
the heavens fall...

http://search.wordpress.org/1.6

Pulls up all kinds of mailing list stuff that users can't know about. :\

There's no reason to be petulant about the issue, Aaron. Your issue was 
resolved. The WP Support community has a hardline view with regards to 
unstable versions, and you stumbled across that view.

I don't see the purpose of this thread at all. Do in Rome as Romans do. 
Time to move on.

This was not derogatory. It was meant to not clutter the mailing list, but
since you want it cluttering the mailing list, here it is. Nothing
derogatory about this.

"It was not a 1.6 support issue, Podz. what is your problem???  Have you
descended into cliquishness? I don't do support because I don't WANT to do
support and I don't HAVE to do support.  What does that have to do with
GETTING support from the forum?  How many people do you think that ask for
support ever really give support?  Quit being a croney and look at the big
picture.  The issue was solved and I added an additional note for your
future 1.6 users who might need to know what I said.  It was a post-script
and irrelevant to the solution that was offered.  Very bad image here, Podz.
Very bad."

It's really a shame that this has to be turned into such a big problem... it
really is.

Don't do that... Moshu's post wasn't meant to be an insult, or a
blight on WordPress, it was simply a friendly reminder that 1.6
_isn't_ supported in the forums, in case people start asking about it.
Don't leave just because of that. We're all friends here really :)
Just that what appears to be an offensive email will recieve offensive
replies, particularily by the people that put a lot of time and effort
into the forums.

Let's just label this a misunderstanding and move on, folks.

The issue was not on whether or not you have to give support to get
support, the issue however is over your say in things, and the point
Podz is trying to make is that unless you suddenly start contributing
to the forums, your say is not going to hold nearly as much merit as
the people who spend hours upon hours. Your thoughts on 1.6 and the
forums, especially after this, is going to be moot compared to what
others think.

Mainly because I know how forum moderation goes. I did it for two years for
a big one.  I also know it takes diplomacy at times and to pick your fights
to make it worth it.  I think this was not one of those cases and it cast a
bad light on WordPress.  There's bigger fish to fry than me throwing an "oh
by the way" comment.  They can take a zero-tolerance approach without
killing everyone in the path.  You know? I reckon that's my biggest
frustration with this.  I don't have any issue with a zero-toerance rule but
don't destroy the participants in the process.

That's fine. I applaud the work that the folks at the forum do. No question
about it. Who am I to contribute anything? I'm just a user.

There's little more to be gained by continuing this conversation.

Aaron needn't have reacted as hotly as he did to Moshu's comment.  It's 
unfortunate that he misunderstood Moshu's posting.  We don't need to 
rake him over the coals for that.

The participants here needn't have been as hostile as they were to 
Aaron.  It's a pity that Robert Deaton sent the email he did.  It's 
comments like that his "your say is not going to hold nearly as much 
merit" that really stifle new participation by creating an "old boy's 
club" attitude.

In fairness to Robert, I said that first by comparing AB's contributions 
to those of Moshu. If someone wants to criticise constructively, then I 
welcome that - I believe I have acted in that fashion before. If however 
someone chooses just to attack, then they will reap what they sow. AB is 
no stranger to these mailing lists.

As much as I hate to continue a thread from which there is little more to 
be gained...

The input you're offering is exactly what I read from Aaron's initial post. 
I'm glad that you were able to state it more directly. It sounded to me 
like he was hurt and insulted at feeling slapped down when trying to make a 
contribution.

I am easily able to pick up on his disappointment as I've seen others shot 
down and have even felt ignored and shot down by yourself and others on the 
lists and forums. The negative and defensive responses I get and that I see 
others get may not be a personal attack, but they seem to say "you've 
offended us by not doing things the way you're supposed to", "you're in the 
wrong place and please don't bother us", and "you don't have enough 
experience here to make suggestions to those of us who have been here a 
long time".

I am sure that cronyism is not the WordPress community's intention, but I 
can't believe that you'll get more people involved with the aggressive and 
dismissive tone that I see used with new contributors. Of course, it's not 
just WordPress; Mozilla and other large open-source projects have pockets 
of the same issue. I hope it's possible to avoid, since I think WordPress 
is awesome and should have as much community support as it can get.

I am also hoping that the core contributors can read what Aaron had to say 
and, which the goal of encouraging new participation that you mention, 
avoid being defensive and ask themselves how things might have worked 
differently to help Aaron not only understand what had to be done 
differently about his 1.6 comment, but also to understand that his 
contribution is appreciated. My personal experience has made me feel much 
like Aaron: very adversarial and unmotivated to contribute. I really do 
hope that things seem more encouraging to new participants over time.

Thanks, Scott, for your response acknowledging the need.

-Michael

Just reading things through without looking at the names, that was my 
impression of things as well.

We all communicate so much virtually there are bound to be times we piss 
each other off, when it's best just to take a step back rather than respond.

The wacko on wheels that caused the locking of the Main Page also did 'a lot
of movin'!

I deleted the yucky image he uploaded, and am working through some of
the edits.  Feel free to jump in, and we'll brute force our way through
manually restoring...

If I remember correctly, Matt said something about backups or general
SQL stuff being hard to do because of the Codex being replicated
across multiple servers and being hosted by yahoo, so for the time
being, we may have to continue brute forcing our way through it. I'll
pitch in when I get home.

I've seen a lot of installation "guides" for WordPress, and I think that 
with a little editing, the following is a very nice example. I like the 
flow of requirements, MySQL, and then moving to the actual installation. 
http://www.gnc-web-creations.com/wordpress-installation.htm

Matt mentioned adding screencasts to the Codex, and I'm not sure much 
happened with that, but installation should be one of the first examples 
that should be done. Nice, simple and easy to understand.

I vote for making the process on the backend as easy, one click as 
possible, but we also need simple and clear documentation.

My money is still on an installation/upgrade system that checks to see 
what is installed, dates, and then updates whatever needs updating. Is 
that even possible?

Well, I wrote the code to upgrade the DB, and I tested against every 
version that was provided to me, including some WordPress version 
numbered .72.  Whether files/templtes/themes break after the upgrade, I 
can't say, but I know that you should be able to take a database 
directly from .72 or after to at least 1.5.  I suspect that due to the 
way the upgrade code works, it'll take it directly to 1.6, too.

Same with the one I just did.
I have some code for that, if you need it.

I think there is room in the world for high-impact documentation that 
actually provides useful information.  See the attachment for what I 
envisioned.
