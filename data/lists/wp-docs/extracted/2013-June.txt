Subject: [wp-docs] Two tutorials about the Settings API removed ?
Message-ID: <CABHNmYxau9V7ON0eXF4Dbf23TQgw+tHc-4BEA81Pv829gkYJiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I wrote two tutorials about the WP Settings API and they have been removed.
The topics were about how to add multiple sections and forms on a single
settings screen, which confuses a lot of users.

I would like to know why they were removed as the user who did it didn't
leave any comments.

Here is the Settings API page that I am talking about:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API

Guilty as charged! Rollbacks don't allow a comment to be made.

 

When clicking on those links I got something similar to "Page not found -
This is somewhat embarrassing, isn't it?"

 

Also contributors are encouraged to enhance the Codex subject matter, not
just throw links into those articles.

Ah it's because those articles were actually scheduled for later and I
didn't know that scheduled posts were not yet accessible by their URL for
guests.
Anyway I published them now:
http://www.mendoweb.be/blog/wordpress-settings-api-multiple-sections-on-same-page/
http://www.mendoweb.be/blog/wordpress-settings-api-multiple-forms-on-same-page/
If you find those articles useful I might share the link again.

I'll see over time what I can enhance but still relatively new to WP ;)

Subject: [wp-docs] Edit Toolbar Broken?
Message-ID: <A1FEEEAD-4006-4EF0-BDAD-0C91F9DD751A@efieldguide.com>

Hi,

I turned on the edit toolbar in my preferences, but it didn't appear. So I looked at the browser console and found this error:
[16:26:03.239] ReferenceError: addButton is not defined @ http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=User_talk:MichaelH&action=edit&section=new:103
I searched the DOM for addButton with the debugger, but didn't find it, so I guess some JS isn't being loaded.

While looking into this issue I also noticed that this stylesheet was returning a 404: http://codex.wordpress.org/skins/codex/FF2Fixes.css

Am I the only one having this problem?

Hi All, 

I'm Cameron. I've been making my living designing / coding wordpress themes for the past couple of years.

Time to give back.

I frequently write small tutorials for clients on the custom parts of themes I build, and they're always well-recieved. Going on that, I thought that the codex would be a great place for me to contribute to.

Wouldn't mind spearheading the below item from the task list, even if it is 8 years old. Looks like a proper article doesn't exist quite yet.
> Lesson: Debugging layouts with the DOM inspector [http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=25434]

Any of you benevolent admins have a different suggestion? I'm happy to be here, but green as far as contributing goes.


Happy Wednesday,

I think this was for the codex edit bar not working... And if so, we may 
need to hunt down Otto.

JD - You were activating it on codex.wordpress.org right?

Yeah, the edit bar doesn't work. Never has, AFAIK. My suggestion for the
moment: learn wiki-markup. I have no other suggestions to offer at this
time. It's low-priority. Sorry. :(

Yes, I was talking about the codex edit bar. I'm picking up the wiki markup quickly, so it's no big deal. I just wasn't sure if this was a known issue. Maybe I'll add a note about it somewhere so people know.
