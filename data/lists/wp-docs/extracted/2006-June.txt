Subject: [wp-docs] Theme removal question
Message-ID: <0b5a01c6864a$c47fa780$6500a8c0@Beastmach>

Hello Group,

I just signed up here because I added a theme I've been busting my butt on 
to the Codex themes list (under 3 column) and it was swiftly removed. This 
is my second theme, the first has been on the two-column list for a year, 
never had a problem, it's been download nearly 6000 times.

So far the feedback about this new theme has been excellent. I went to great 
lengths to allow non-technical users to add their flikr, and skype, stats, 
contact form, and such without making the theme invalid or inaccessible. 
Same with styles and all sorts of stuff. The functionality of this theme is 
pretty deep. But none of it affects the operability or update-ability of WP 
itself. My theme adds to WP, but doesn't interfere or take away from it. 
Using the links template, I even added a facility for someone to create a 
full-fledged dynamic site map for added accessibility.

As far as I know the only place I strayed from the recommendations is that I 
used a lot of shorthand PHP (I didn't see that new recommendation until it 
was too late). I wouldn't suspect my theme would be removed from the Codex 
for *that* would it?

I want to replace the Codex entry, but obviously won't until I can ensure 
it's not going to be removed and I'm not breaking any rules. I spilled a lot 
of blood and sweat making this one so I'd hate to see it dismissed 
summararily.

Can someone tell me why it was removed and may I put it back.

Here's is the forum post announcing the theme (a respondent suggest I ask 
here): http://wordpress.org/support/topic/74190

And here is the theme demo (the entire site is devoted to theme support):

In advance, thanks.

Probably I am not the best person to answer your question (I rarely
edited the Codex in the last several months) but looking at the
history of the theme list page:
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Using_Themes/Theme_List&act
ion=history
I couldn't find any trace of your editing/ adding or of removal.

As far as I know every edit/change is registered.
I've checked the "Recent Changes" page, too - nothing about your
adding. Are you sure you saved your changes?

Mike,

The last edit to http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes/Theme_List occurred
on May 31st.  In other words, MediaWiki isn't reporting you did edit that
article.

In the interim, I've added your theme to the 3-column section of that
article.

Thanks for contributing to Codex.

@ Moshu: I noted that too (trying to figure out the removal), Moshu, but I 
did see the link after I saved it and tested it... unless I actually didn't 
:O. Maybe I was looking at the preview (if so, what a dummy I am and I 
sincerely apologize).

@Michael: Terrific. Thank you so much for taking care of me.
