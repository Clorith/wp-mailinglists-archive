Subject: [wp-docs] bookmark-template.php
Message-ID: <27903c8ce867f3cb7037dea03736b790@torresgroup.us>

I'm trying to to do an analysis on the various "wp_list_*" functions in the
various template files.

Bookmarks is my first run at this.

I have a question on the documentation on this function...

title_li
(string) Text for the heading of the links list. Defaults to
'__('Bookmarks')', which displays "Bookmarks" (the __('') is used for
localization purposes). Only used with categorize set to 0 (else the
category names will be used instead). If passed a null (0) value, no
heading is displayed, and the list will not be wrapped with <ul>, </ul>
tags (be sure to pass the categorize option to 0 to this option takes
effect).

....

'categorize' is defaulted to '1', meaning TRUE (that's another discussion).

If TRUE, than the categories are displayed and not the word "Bookmarks"; as
the dox state.

If set to FALSE, the word "Bookmark" is shown and not the individual
categories; as the dox state.

But...  "If passed a null (0) value, no heading is displayed"

This is not the case. If a NULL is passed, the conditional check does a
backhand Boolean check and "Bookmark" is displayed.

Is the dox incorrect, or is the function incorrect?

Thanks

Walter

>=====================

"If passed a null (0) value, no heading is displayed" - this statement
is correct. I checked it.

The "null value" here refers to the null value of the parameter
"title_li". If the value of this param is set ot "null" by inserting
"title_li=&categorize=0" etc, the title "Bookmarks" or whatever is not
displayed and the list is not wrapped by <ul></ul> tags as mentioned
in the Codex.

The misconstruing is perhaps caused by mixing of the explanation
regarding the categorize and title_li args in one paragraph.

I think the developers felt that this condition will be used by
someone who wants to use his own selection of titles with h3, h2 (or
even h1 if he doesn't bother himself with SEO :)), <ul> etc with class
options.

But what I feel after poring over the whole thing is that a little
more explanation about these various options will help the users as to
under what condtions these arguments will be useful.

But thinking laterally, are these tags any longer relevant, or rather
would anyone use them now that everyone is on to the ubiquitous widget
thing to populate the sidebars, top bars, bottom bars and in between
bars....!!

Thanks for going through all this. If the tags are no longer relevant, aka
deprecated, please mark them accordingly and link to the appropriate
documentation that replaces them. This will not just help Codex users, but
also help those working on the handbook.

Thanks!

Hello

My name is Tom and I just wanted to introduce my self..

I was frustrated with the lack of documentation in the WPMU Functions  
section so I decided to work on the section so far I have done a fair  
bit and I am continuing to work through all the functions.

I was just wondering if anyone would like to review my changes so far  
to ensure I am doing things right and give me a bit of feedback about  
what I have been doing.


Kind Regards

The WPMU functions pages generally have pretty slow development (you've 
probably noticed!), I guess because it's a bit of a specialised area, so 
it's great to have another keen, young contributor on the scene!  There 
was a flurry of activity a couple of months ago which I think has died 
down a little.  Perhaps your enthusiasm will rub off (I'm meaning on me, 
as well as anyone else who's feeling guilty about not contributing very 
recently, here).  And I don't even mean any of that as patronisingly as 
it sounds.  I guess you're Ctsttom.

I'm a little concerned that the 'Family' section you've added to some of 
the functions (I presume the plan is to add it to all the function 
documentation given it's in the template you've made) is going to be 
difficult to manage and could get pretty unwieldy while not being the 
most helpful thing in the world.  I know quite a few of the main 
functions, and some of the MU functions, include a related functions 
section.  What's the advantage of splitting related functions up into 
these specific family sections rather than the less specific related 
functions way?

I notice also you created the WPMU Functions category which is basically 
just the same as the WPMU Functions page.  While I appreciate it's 
helpful to have them all in one place, I'm not keen on the near exact 
replication of the two (and, to be honest, in my opinion there aren't 
enough MU pages to make the main category so mind-bogglingly complex 
that the new category is strictly required).  Looking at the main WP 
function reference /page/ the added value of that page (over the 
Functions /category/) is that it groups the functions further and adds 
more narrative.  Did you have plans along those lines for the WPMU 
Functions page?  I'd be interested to hear other people's opinions on 
that -- perhaps I'm just too used to the way things are now to see the 
benefit here :)

Apologies I've rattled on for so long.  As I say: it's great to have 
another MU contributor and I just got excited.  My estimation is that 
we'll get to the end of documenting the WPMU functionality just in time 
for the WP3 launch party ;)

Yes thats me. My plan is to finish updating the WPMU Functions section  
my self if no one else gets stuck in.

It wasn't intended to be used everywhere more to highlight that in  
that particular part there are a pairs of functions which have  
siblings which do similar things, I think I got a bit carried away  
with the parent, child thing but I found that it helped to explain  
where the function sits in relation to the others, its possible we  
could use the Taxonomy feature of mediawiki but I don't know about  
this and was kind of just test driving it for that bit where it made  
sense. It probably shouldn't be in the template though?

I implemented this because the /Functions for WP has this same  
duplication and I wanted to see if it was useful to others. If not  
feel free to delete or what ever as I am not keen on it after sleeping  
on it over night.

Thats no problem, its great to hear I am kind of on the road. What  
other documentation are you referring to or is the WP3 launch party  
really soon?

Yep, probably and if we aim for that, it would actually be perfect.

Hey all!

Just finished documenting and revising the WPMU Functions section.

I haven't checked to see if there are any missing functions but I have  
now been through and created basic documentation for every function on  
the list and also improved those which has very poor or minimal  
definition. I have also been through and modified those which were  
already very good and modified the format of them to make them all  
consistent.

Would anyone mind reviewing them now that I have finished?

So far, lookin' good. I just skimmed, and did notice a self-referential 
link. Not sure if it needs to be there.

And I want to go double-check on exactly how many extra functions there 
are and make sure you get them all. :D

I was ging to say this part:

"You can find a full list of all the WPMU Functions (documented or not) 
here WPMU_Functions. "

but then I noticed that the WPMU_functions was linking to a separate 
page, not Category:WPMU_Functions (which is the page I looked at)

But if I find it confusing, maybe others will too?

I don't know about what they will be confused by because I don't  
understand what your saying its like your only saying half the  
sentence I don't understand what you mean?

On this page: http://codex.wordpress.org/Category:WPMU_Functions

read the 4th paragraph. Also, this ties in to the following, from a

Do you mean the page, the category or the link?

Cards on the table: I don't like the category much.  I think it's 
superfluous to requirements given we have the page.  However if we do 
keep it then we do need to link from one to the other.  Perhaps in that 
case it would help to change the paragraphs at the top of one or other 
to at least prevent the confusion of it looking like it's the same page.

Perhaps we should rename the "WPMU Functions" to "WPMU Function 
Reference" and give it an overhaul to be more like the main function 
reference with a wider scope.  It could then also include links to 
documentation on MU's additional classes as well as the functions.

Other than that I agree with Andrea -- it's looking good!  I notice 
there are a few functions missing from the list still (such as the 
excellent is_user_spammy), so now most of the stuff that was there is 
now documented it's probably worth going through and adding all the 
missing functions and documenting those.  It doesn't seem like the 
function list has been updated for a good while and with that in mind it 
also strikes me that it might be worth adding some version information 
to each function so people aren't looking for things which don't exist 
for their particular install.

This sounds reasonable. I think deleting the page may be easiest.

Subject: [wp-docs] Undocumented oEmbed in WP 2.9
Message-ID: <BLU106-DS4854BBE40A2DC401A247689C20@phx.gbl>

Hello documenters,

I was recently elated to discover WordPress 2.9's new oEmbed functionality, which was announced (http://www.viper007bond.com/2009/10/13/easy-embeds-for-wordpress-2-point-9/) by Viper007Bond on his blog. Although his blog post does a wonderful job of explaining the new capabilities, the WordPress Codex is devoid of any documentation ? see http://codex.wordpress.org/oEmbed .

I think we should take some action to document this new feature, since it IS a really big improvement over the previous media features in the core. (I understand that WordPress 2.9 hasn't even reached the beta phase yet, but I believe we've already reached the feature-freeze date and this is likely to stay in for the stable release.) If there are others out there who are running 2.9-rare from trunk like I am, I think it would be great if we could comb through the information and put some of it on the Codex.

Just putting the idea out there.

Regards,
Frederick Ding (http://www.frederickding.com/)

We are not officially in feature freeze yet, but yes, the oembed stuff  
will be part of 2.9 and should be documented, based on Viper007Bond's  
blog post.

Subject: [wp-docs] Study on Framework Documentation
Message-ID: <4ADC8E72.5080304@cs.mcgill.ca>

Dear WordPress contributors,

We are interviewing open source developers who have worked on the 
documentation of their project to get a better understanding of the 
effort it takes to create and maintain documentation. This work is part 
of my Ph.D. in Computer Science at McGill University.

*We would like one of the WordPress contributors to be part of this 
study*. We are especially interested in people who contributed to the 
documentation of WordPress plugin development.

The involvement of the participant would consist of a single 45-minute 
phone interview in which we would ask open-ended questions about the 
documentation process in WordPress and the problems encountered when 
creating and maintaining documentation.

In recognition for your valuable participation, we will send you the 
report summarizing our results before it gets published.

If someone is interested in participating to this survey, please contact 
me at bart at cs.mcgill.ca with suggestions of dates and times (with your 
timezone) that would best suit you.

Your insights would be invaluable in helping advance our knowledge of 
documentation processes, and we hope one of you will be able to participate.

Best regards,
Barth?l?my Dagenais



*About this study*
If you have any question about this study, do not hesitate to contact me 
at bart at cs.mcgill.ca or my supervisor, Prof. Martin Robillard, at 
martin at cs.mcgill.ca.

Matt Mullenweg kindly suggested to send this invitation to this mailing 
list.

Your collective thoughts on

?

I can see the concept behind the page "list your kick ass CMS examples", 
but it really just seems to be yet another SEO link fest.  I cry a

Matt follows this mailing list, so let's first give him a chance to clean
out the "spammy" links. Or he'll ask me or someone else to do so.

While this was started a long time ago, it might be opening up a door we'd
like closed for now since User Pages are personal - or should be. I've been
wanting them to get out of the eyes of search engines for years, especially
as many of use them to write up drafts that may have errors or
misinformation.

Thanks.

Has anyone jumped on this yet? Just don't want to flood them, but also want
to direct the right people in their direction if you feel this is
appropriate for us to respond. I'll email them directly for more information
if people want to know more before deciding.

Thanks!

Also keep in mind the WordPress Showcase has a tag for uses of
WordPress as a CMS. You can see the sites here:

http://wordpress.org/showcase/tag/cms/

Many of the more notable/interesting sites on Matt's list have been
migrated over to the Showcase (I did this in May or so). If you come
across a site that is on a list somewhere and is Showcase-worthy,
please do submit it for the Showcase:

http://wordpress.org/showcase/submit-a-wordpress-site/

Showcase submissions are manually reviewed and whether or not a site
is added is based on the criteria listed on the submit a site page
linked to above.
