Going through some trac tickets, thinking we should try to have more 
overlap between help in codex and help in dashboard. If anyone wants to 
rewrite http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19442 help text to be 
clearer, have at it.

Message-ID: <1EE23CC3-7A50-4950-96E2-C60CF14AA313@hearingvoices.com>

wanted to inform y'all i'm working on a Naming Slugs page:
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Hearvox/Naming_Slugs

it'll detail what gets a slug, and how to edit that slug.
why you sometimes get "-2" added to your slug.
how slugs are part of permalink URLs (& maybe how permalinks can affect SEO).
how post slugs (esp. Page CPT) can, in rare cases, conflict (aka, collide) with
other post-type slugs, or taxonomy slugs (also rewrite bases and page templates).

been consulting w/ wp-hackers list to make sure i get it right.
once it's further along, i'll submit it for consideration as a Codex Docs

just wanted to heads-up y'all for now,

Hi Barrett,

There is an issue that has yet to be fixed (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3329) but would not hurt to be included in documentation. Slugs should not contain the character %.  They kind of work but break the editor to change them.

I spend most of my time on the support forums and one of the Codex 
sections that I send users to multiple times a day is 
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#A_Page_of_Posts>.

However, the current example - whilst a good resource for a coder - is 
rather overwhelming for someone who is only at the tinkering stage. It's 
also based on Kubrick rather than Twenty Eleven. On that basis, how 
about adding:

<http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Esmi/Twenty_Eleven_Page_of_Posts>

It's more in line with what most users on the forums want. Perhaps the 
two existing examples could be re-classified as "Advanced Examples"?

Thoughts?

You know, I'm thinking there's probably a lot of sections need
something like this. Creating a network, for example...

Rod,

 

You can use the Templates {{rfd}} to request article deletion or
{{Deprecated}} for deprecated functions.

 

I suppose {{rfd}} makes the most sense here unless someone else suggests
otherwise.



Regards

The page Custom Backgrounds for theme developers was removed a year
ago leaving eleven broken links, while other theme features like
Custom Headers and Navigation Menus still have pages summarizing the
relevant functions. Wouldn't it look better to have a Custom
Backgrounds page again, even if it doesn't say anything very special?

A section explaining some background on what the feature is would be nice.

There is potential for explaining the code side of Custom Backgrounds
(and Custom Headers). Plugins and Themes have an opportunity to extend
functionality in various hooks that hasn't been utilized very much. A
collection of the related hooks could be appropriate.

My favorite reason for looking at that particular page (and Custom
Headers) is to use it as an example for how to do a Settings page in a
php class (using "take_action" etc.) to make sure I don't leave
anything out (but I don't know how to utilize that in a codex page).

Message-ID: <CAK--mtqeBqDtENV-VLrTVVdj9WbK5Z6--sM2P9SWtC5oMOt=yA@mail.gmail.com>

This statement is under the Usage on the
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script page:

'''Use the <tt>wp_enqueue_scripts</tt> action to call this function,
or <tt>admin_enqueue_scripts</tt> to call it on the admin side.'''
Calling it outside of an action can lead to problems. See
[http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11526 #11526] for details.

The ticket has already been fixed and there isn't any other supporting
reason not to use wp_enqueue_script.  Also, the function is called
directly in current themes, including twentyeleven.

This statement should be removed, shouldn't it?
