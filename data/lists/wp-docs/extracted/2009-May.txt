Subject: [wp-docs] codex spam influx
Message-ID: <MG7JzhA4llFKFwKP@dsl-217-155-35-239.zen.co.uk>

There seems to have been an influx of spamming on the Codex with random 
users adding links to all sorts of existing and new pages, the links 
starting with "text" but otherwise seeming random.

Don't know if there's anything that can be done about it other than wait 
for it to go away.  I've undone what I can but may have missed some as 
it's not obvious. Perhaps there's an IP range that can be blocked...

Blocked all those users.  Looks like you got everyone of their spam, thank 
you.
