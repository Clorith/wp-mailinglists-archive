Message-ID: <45E87DEF.2020707@mullenweg.com>

Hello everyone.

If anyone is running 2.1.1, or knows someone who is, I would recommend 
upgrading to 2.1.2 as soon as possible. It is now available at 
http://wordpress.org/download/

The md5 of the tar.gz is b1ae0c152e60300cba8c40c030baafd4.

No announcement quite yet, but coming soon. Thanks for your help.

Your motto "code is poetry" says it all.   Your material is not
accessible to people like me.   I have no interest in computers.  I use
mine to put out a blog.   It is only the substance i care for.

When I look at instructions concerning how to upgrade or anything else,
I find only technical lingo.   I am sorry you have no interest in or use
for people like me.    Still, I wish you well.

People like Sidney will find upgrade instructions obtuse however
user-friendly we make them. People like Sidney should have someone else
doing their upgrades for them. People like Sidney should be on
wordpress.com.

My mother-in-law is like Sidney. I do her upgrades for her.

I second this motion about accessibility!

My proposal for the new "Installing WordPress" document.

Step 1: Browse to upgrade.wordpress.org, and click on the "Please Upgrade my
blog to WordPress Version 2.1.2" button.

Step 2: After the upgrade is completed, click on the link, "Your upgrade to
WordPress Version 2.1.2 is complete.  Have fun with WordPress!",  to return
to blogging.

+1

On a more serious note.

The only way we can really please these people is to build  
"automatic" upgrade into the core. Which is likely to be a nightmare  
especially from a security point of view.

Documentation will never make them happy.

Is someone doing something strange with the Codex or its templates or

over the edit window, which makes it impossible to use. This is new 
behavior as of now that wasn't happening just 1 hour ago. (FireFox 
1.5.07, I know it's time to upgrade, WinXP).

Also I am having intermittent page loading issues where I ask for a

It looks like this file is cut off before its end, maybe that has 
something to do with it?

http://codex.wordpress.org/skins/common/wikibits.js

Anyway, both problems are still happening for me, after updating 
Firefox to 2.0.x. Lloyd, maybe you have some files cached or are using 
a different browser?

Also, I noticed the Codex pages HTML does not validate, whether on the 
editing page or not (extra closing DIV tags), so maybe that is the 
problem. The odd thing is that it was working fine for me earlier 
today, then suddenly stopped, though nothing on my system changed at 
that time.

Sidney clearly appreciates the poetry, or he wouldn't have commented in  
the first place.

He's just saying he'd appreciate point-and-click instructions.

That doesn't make him defective or unworthy, it makes him representative 
of the global blogging phenomenon.

I think he is:
"Sidney Gendin, Ph.D. is a professor of philosophy of law at Eastern
Michigan University."
And I think you should run - right now:
"He became interested in powerlifting in 1997 at age 63 after 22 years
of inactivity and has now reached 315 in the bench press, up from
135."
http://www.mesomorphosis.com/articles/gendin/bio.htm

Then again, I'm not that sure about the first assertion:
http://www.mesomorphosis.com/articles/gendin/index.htm

Also, I'm not quite sure he knows about spam either:
http://watchingpolitics.com/?pagename=about

Anyway, enough googling for this morning...

> That doesn't make him defective or unworthy, it makes him representative

+1. But that's why there is wp.com and blogger.com and such...

Uhhh.. wasn't this "dropped" earlier..? I could have sworn it was... 
[scratches head]...

Now I'll have something to write about on VB, and make them look like a 
tinker-bell, in a pretty pink tutu... I'll point out whatever on the VB 
blog then, thanks for reference links and so forth. ;) :) Whee! Hahaha.. 
Nah, it's not worth it. All this Google digging for merely kidding 
around in the beginning.. Geesh folks.. :P

Can we drop this now, or ... ya wanna bury it now, and dig it back up a 
few years down the road... or.. ? LOL! :P

Hi Jennifer,

Did it sort itself out? On all of our sites we use the "Internet
accelerator" Netli. Well Netli was losing the ends of some files and
the effect seemed random because it depended on where on the net your
computer resided.

Cheers,
Lloyd

The Codex has never totally validated. Long story, bad reasons, just is 
that way.

I've pounded through a bunch of pages and haven't found any similar 
description, either. HOWEVER, check to make sure that you don't have 
Adblock or another similar Firefox Extension enabled. I've had a bunch 
of problems on the Codex with some of the content blocking Firefox 
extensions in the past.

I'm on the road, but I will be home in the office next week so I'll look 
into this more if you are still having trouble. Have you (cough-choke) 
tried editing with IE? Is it the same?

While it is fun to poke at the "mumbo jumbo", and indeed, the 
responsibility for solving the problem of installation and upgrades 
reside with the developers to make this simpler for the simple (which 
can include some very savvy folks, not just simpletons), the WordPress 
Lessons part of the Codex were written and developed with "simpletons" 
in mind. We need more in that area.

Part of the Table of Contents reorganization I'm working on will help to 
direct those who need more handholding to the WordPress Lessons and 
advanced users to the more advanced sections. We need to cater to all 
needs from totally web ignorant to master developer. That makes the task 
of the Codex structure a challenge.

The Codex is meant to be a complement to WordPress, not a replacement. 
Users shouldn't have to have the Codex sitting next to them to figure 
out how to push each button. The two must work hand in hand to help the 
user "use" WordPress. While I long for simple and easy, push button 
technology, we have to work what we have now. I'm very proud of everyone 
who has contributed to the Codex because I know that you all believe in 
this and it is an honor to work with people who care so much about 
helping WordPress users use WordPress better.

Thanks, it seems to be better today. That must have been it.

Thanks for this. I definitely meant this note as a reminder that we 
still have a long way to go, not as an opportunity to make fun of 
somebody who probably has more on their mind than learning about all the 
knowledge that our documentation and WP pre-supposes.

Hi folks,
This mail landed in my inbox today. I occasionally get an email like
this. This time, I thought I would reproduce it here to share a couple
of thoughts with you. The reason I did not forward the mail to this
list is that it arrived a different email id from the one I am
subscribed to wp-docs with.

The email:
-----------------
Hi Carthik,

I'm a database developer but a newbie to WP.

1. How do I find a theme that I like?  The number of them is
overwhelming.  When I go to: http://themes.wordpress.net/
I see black rectangles where the screenshots should be.  Am I doing
something wrong?

2. The official wordpress.org website has lessons on it but there are
dozens of tiny lessons.  Is there anyplace to download a large WP
tutorial/document as a PDF, print it out and work with?

Thanks a lot!

--------------

My comments:
1) The themes at themes.wordpress.net need some love - black
rectangles are not really helpful. :) I noticed this earlier, but I
thought it is something transient and might get fixed soon.

2) We do need a book-ish thingy that we can point users at that they
can download. This might just be the single most important missing
link in the documentation.

I will reply to the user myself for now - he seems to have found my
comment on my own userpage inviting users to contact me for help if
the codex fails them, which brings us to point 3:
3) We need to have a way to let codex's users contact a person, or a
team(the wp-docs list, the forums?) if the codex fails to answer their
question/fulfil their need. This needs to be highlighted, maybe a
little more than it is now.

Regards,
Carthik.

There is a link marked "Support" in the main top navigation bar on 
WordPress.org. I am not sure how much more obvious it could be.

It might be helpful if the Support Forum site had a little bit of a 
hint of how to use it... but at least that link does get you to the 
support forums, which is where people should go with their questions. 
At least, I think so.

Also, if someone goes to the left nav while reading codex articles, 
they might try "Troubleshooting", which will lead them directly to 
several helpful resources.

So I don't think this is really an issue... if someone does not look 
in the main nav bar for help, or the left nav bar, I don't think we 
can do anything for them.

You're both right. And even though it was a "couldn't resist" type of 
opportunity to poke fun at Sidney, the reason behind Matt's initial 
email should have been taken seriously. My apologizes for adding in 
sarcasm, and poking fun at Sidney.

I admit that I'm a WP newcomer, but the Docs section is very confusing - it
is going around in circles.

If you go to http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page there are many topics
repeated there under several headings.
Example: Using Themes is under Working With Wordpress and Design and Layout.
There are many other examples.  This is confusing.

Then, if you click on a topic like Working with Wordpress:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Working_with_WordPress#WordPress_Features
you are taken to a second screen with many/all of topics from the first
screen now arranged in a two column format under different headers, but
still with no instructions or information.

You have click a third time to actually get to pages with
instructions/information on them.

All in all, its like a maze.

I apologize if people on this list were involved in creating this, but as a
newcomer, it is frustrating trying to find things and get to the actual
information.

Um, I got the same email. To a couple of accounts. I agree with the 
sentiments, but the fact that you got one, too...I'm also suspicious.

The Theme Viewer has problems with the lack of thumbnails, especially on 
older and less "active" Themes. I've let them know of this and some 
other problems the Theme Viewer has, specifically the fact that 
WordPress Theme authors are uploading WordPress 2.1+ ready Themes and 
they are still using 2.0 so the Themes break in the demos. I emailed 
them a couple weeks ago and am still waiting for an answer.

As for the PDF, Podz was creating a lot of them, but there are a couple 
WordPress Plugins which will automatically turn any "page" into a PDF 
file. As for the "book thing", there are several new books, including a 
WordPress for Dummies, coming out soon. I'll be posting my draft of the 
surface structural reorder of the TOC for the Codex soon for you all to 
hash over before we go public, which will help a lot. But whatever did 
happen to those PDF files and links to them?

As documents and additions have been coming faster than structures

this and will have a new "version" very soon. Stay tuned and you'll see 
the discussion here in the next week or so.

"Thanks for paying attention and helping to remind us that this is way

Thank you for taking the comments/suggestions well.

Just a note that as things are redone it would be great to be able to
download individual topics and a consolidated version as PDF files.

I find it much easier to print it out and work with it than trying to bounce
back and forth between windows.

In the meanwhile, I ordered the WordPress 2 book by Langer and Jordan,
despite the mixed reviews on Amazon.

I hope it's going to help.

Subject: [wp-docs] Developer doc to dos
Message-ID: <45F5DE0A.6030008@poplarware.com>

In my continual quest to improve the documentation for developers on 
WordPress, I have made a To Do list:

http://codex.wordpress.org/JHodgdon/Dev_Doc_To_Dos

I am interested in your comments. If you are a developer who works on 
themes, plugins, or the core sections of WordPress, what do you think 
needs improvement in the Codex documentation? That could include 
navigation problems, individual articles that need some attention, or 
new articles that need to be written.

Regarding navigation, I am assuming as a starting point that a 
developer will find either Developer Documentation or Advanced Topics. 
(Lorelle?). Then, my idea is that all the links on link-listing pages 
should be relevant and also annotated, and if the user is led to 
another page of links, they should be told they are visiting a list of 
links, and that list should be something like "Central repository for 
links related to themes and templates", rather than just another 
random collection.

Also regarding navigation, I have taken "Further Reading" lists out of 
a lot of the developer articles, in order to centralize maintenance of 
link lists. For instance, if you read an article on writing a plugin, 
rather than having 3 links at the bottom for further reading, it 
should direct you back to the central list of all plugin-related links.

Anyway, please take a look at the To Do list and let me know what you 
think. Also, could those of you who are already working on improving 
specific developer-related documentation, or adding new pages, let me 
know so that I can make a note of that on the To Do list page?

Thanks,
     Jennifer

I'll take a look but I wanted to just clarify a little about "related 
links". If the external link article is directly related to the topic, 
then I believe it should be included in the article. A reference to all 
the links in a resource link list is fine, but let's not make the reader 
hunt too hard.

Great work. I'm thrilled to see this area developed! Thank you.

Subject: [wp-docs] A Note on WordPress Lessons
Message-ID: <45F5FF33.8070607@cameraontheroad.com>

I've started cleaning up the WordPress Codex Table of Contents in 
preparation for changing their structure. This involves removing the 
"NEW" on old articles and just making sure everything is included. It's 
a very tedious process, so this is slow going. Once I have figured out 
what is missing (and please point out any articles not listed in the TOC 
pages in case I miss them) and added them to the appropriate place, then 
I'll have a better offering of how to structure the TOC better. I'll be 
sending out a list of the order and such for your recommendation before 
I do anything. Stay tuned for that.

I also wanted to clear up some confusion that the WordPress Lessons 
section may have for you.

WordPress Lessons is a separate but inclusive part of the WordPress 
Codex. I think of the WordPress Codex divided up into two parts. There 
is the technical user manual for all of the specific tech how to and 
explanations. This includes beginning, get started, and all the stuff to 
the highest techie levels.

The other part is a group of tutorials called WordPress Lessons. The 
Lessons rely heavily upon the technical manual articles but offer a 
unique writing style. Instead of 1, 2, 3 tech talk, these are the 
tutorial guides which slowly lead a new user through a process 
step-by-step. In presenting these a few years ago, I described them as 
written so the reader feels like a WordPress support volunteer is 
sitting by their side saying "now do this, now that, that's good, that's 
right, you're on the right- oh, no, go back, now fix this - that's 
better" tone of voice. Not patronizing but helpful and guiding.

The WordPress Lessons were never intended to become replacements for the 
technical manual information. Due to the lack of articles on some of 
these subjects, WordPress Lessons are now filtered into the technical 
side of the Codex.

I would like to see the holes in the technical documentation on some of 
these subjects get more technical articles filling them. There is a list 
on the http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks Task List which may help 
if you are interested in writing these technical articles.

In starting my "cleaning" process on the TOC, I found two whole sections 
of WordPress Lesson links removed with a link to two other table of 
contents pages. It should be the other way around. We need to keep 
WordPress Lessons with Lessons so people will have one place featuring 
these guides and tutorials, so please keep them with the Lessons and 
refer to them from the other Tables of Contents in the future.  If a 
technical article on the subject is needed, do it or add it to the to do 
task list, please.

I'd love to have no repetition to the same links from multiple TOC 
pages. But sometimes that can't be helped. Let's use this as a clue to a 
"technical article needed here". ;-)

Thanks,

Lorelle

Excellent list. Fantastic. I'm whelmed. And thrilled!

Here are my thoughts.

* The Loop - What did you have in mind for this? We have two articles on 
the WordPress Loop. One is written as a basic technical explanation and 
the other "Loop in Action" was written for the WordPress Lessons for a 
step-by-step look at how to customize the loop for different needs. I'd 
love to see more custom features for using the Loop in separate articles 
related to blog models and their specific needs, as well as these two 
articles updated.

* Conditional Tags/Includes - I'd love to see a "Conditional Tags in 
Action" WordPress Lesson-style article that uses the conditional tags 
and includes in various methods, expanding upon the basic technical how 
to. The Conditional Tags article is really lacking in quality examples, 
but it doesn't need to do everything. A WordPress Lesson can add more 
features. It also needs to be edited and updated as it is not clear on 
how it works within the code examples.

* Hacking WordPress - WordPress Plugins have pretty much totally 
replaced hacks. So we need to be sure how we are going to go forth in 
the future with the issue of "hacking" WordPress while still being very 
clear that modifications to the core programming is NOT recommended, and 
potentially dangerous with the new frequency of upgrades coming out 
faster than ever. What's the current policy?

* Hardening WordPress - This is really, really controversial. I know 
it's not on your list, but security topics are and this is one of them. 
We need to clearly address the issue of security flaws and potential 
risks in WordPress, especially in WordPress Plugins, while not exposing 
flaws or potential "back doors" into WordPress. This is a big one and we 
really need to get a consensus and policy on how to write about this 
because it is SO important, while not opening a door we don't want open.

Additional Articles

I'd also like to recommend you include a few other articles to that list 
that are on the Task List

* http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Common_WordPress_Errors We 
really need a better listing of the most common WordPress errors with 
tips on how to fix them such as errors during installation, mysql 
errors, plugins not found errors...we need examples of what it looks 
like when the error occurs as people often don't have the words or 
language to describe the error, and then how to fix it. This would be 
excellent as a reference for the Support Forum.

* http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Foreign_Language_Characters - I 
don't know how "developer" this is, or if I should hand it off to 
someone on polygots, but we need some articles on handling foreign 
language characters in WordPress. WordPress now works well with 
right-to-left languages, but we need some technical articles on foreign 
language techniques. Recent surveys are indicating a huge demand in 
Japanese, Chinese, and other Asian blogs, so we need coverage in English 
on that so it can be translated by those support groups. Interested?

* http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Custom_PHP_Queries - I see that 
David House signed up for this. Any idea if he is still working on an 
article for custom PHP queries? Maybe we can get Kaf to work on this or 
help.

* Do's and Don'ts for WordPress Plugins - I'd love to see a very 
specific do's and don'ts for WordPress Plugin writers. I found some 
articles on Head Zoo ( 
http://headzoo.com/tutorials/writing-a-wordpress-plugin and 
http://headzoo.com/tutorials/wordpress-plugin-tips-and-tricks ) that may 
be worth approaching the author for editing and inclusion in the Codex - 
or using some of the offerings for a new article. We really need some 
WordPress Lessons to help beginners learn to write WordPress Plugins as 
well as technical articles. It is the hottest growing area and we need 
to create some very strong standards and offer articles on how to avoid 
security holes, another big ickie.

I haven't been through the Forum looking for article ideas for a while. 
Have you gone through the Advanced area to look for what is hot and the 
most popular technical topics brought up? This is our best tool for 
determining what we need in the Codex. It's critically important that 
the support volunteers have something to point to for redundant topics.

Great work and I'm so excited to get this area worked on. It is much overdo!

Sorry, that was my fault! But I don't think that all of the articles 
referenced in those particular "Lessons" sections were really lessons, 
  in the style of tutorials. Does it really make sense to have 
hand-holding articles on advanced development topics anyway?

Agreed. I have certainly left the directly-relevant links in, 
especially near the top and in the bodies of the articles (e.g. "For 
more detail on this subject we just touched upon, see article XYZ" and 
"If you really wanted to read about XYZ instead of W, the subject of 
this article, go here instead"). What I've taken out is the lists at 
the bottom on "where you might want to go from here and some further 
reading", which tended to be arbitrary and incomplete, and instead 
pointing people to the now more complete and annotated lists of both 
internal and external resources on particular subjects 
(themes/templates, plugins, and layout/design) .

Thanks for taking a close look! I'll incorporate your comments in the 
To Do List. Note that a few of the articles I noted down were just 
ones I found that were (a) related to development and (b) marked as 
stubs, or in need of copyedit by others.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <80f75db0703122205g7fee67e8t39b716ea8629c24f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Sorry for butting in so - just thought I'd share what I thought about
the new Main Page (I don't know how old it is, its new for me :) ).

The page lacks vigor. It is boring, and it is almost impossible to
find the page I need, or to see any sense of direction to it. Coupled
with the amputated search, I have to fall back on googles
"site:codex.wordpress.org" search to find what I need - and I know
what I was looking for :)

A little bit of organizing and a "route" or two through the codex, or
a guided tour (or more than one depending on experience/expertise
level) would be great. There is the "New to WordPress article which
does a great job of introducing a new user to wordpress, but it still
makes things complicated since it has many exit paths, and one tends
to lose context (where am I?) after clicking through a page, which
leads to another page, if you see what I mean.

Less is more - no offense, but there is only so much to be said for
verbosity when it comes to documentation.

The reason I thought I'd say this is 'cause I see some folks getting
ready to reorganize, and write new stuff (great work, Jen and
Lorelle!). As always, please don't be discouraged by what I write, or
let it change what you are doing for the worse. Take the good, and
leave the bad behind :)

Regards,
Carthik.

It's the old Main Page still. :) Comments always welcome, though (at 
least, that is my philosophy).

I took no WordPress Lessons out of the Developer or Advanced sections of 
the TOC pages. Only Blog Design and Templates. These are definitely 
"hand holding" articles. Did you see some that were specifically for 
advanced or developer topics?

WordPress Lessons can be on any subject matter, from totally novice to 
extremely complex and advanced. As long as they follow the "voice" of 
the rest of the Lessons. Sometimes even the most over-educated techie 
needs some hand holding. ;-)

 >>>What I've taken out is the lists at the bottom on "where you might

arbitrary and incomplete, and instead pointing people to the now more

They appear arbitrary because at the time there was very little to 
reference. Now there is plenty.

I'm glad we're on the right track with this. It's very exciting to see 
this section develop. Thank you!

Carthik, you are a mind reader as usual. Simple, clean and directly 
targeting people to the areas they need is exactly what I have wanted 
from the very beginning. How I'd love to have total control over the 
CSS, but until that moment, I have to work with what I have.

Now that we have some fantastic articles in each of the sections, they 
can stand on their own, so redoing the front page is going to be a lot 
easier this time around.

I know everyone hates that this process is so slow, but we all do this 
voluntarily, and I believe in working as a team. So it takes the time it 
takes. If they paid me, this would be done in a flash. ;-) Hee hee. 
Wouldn't we all.

I hope this at least somewhat on target for this list ...

I started looking into Widget Plugins at:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/WordPress_Widgets

Which led me to:

http://automattic.com/code/widgets/use/

I downloaded a widgets.zip file which supposedly has the files for doing
Sidebar Widgets with a server install of WP.

But all the *.js files (ie. scriptaculous.js, etc.) files are missing from
the zip.

I've been googling for an answer but haven't found one yet.

Can anyone shed any light?

Thank you.

Brooks

P.S. If widgets.zip isn't the answer, is there another way to get widgets
working?

I don't know if it'll work right now (I installed Widgets almost a year
ago), but try downloading script.aculo.us in
http://script.aculo.us/downloads and follow the instructions in "How do I
install it" on http://automattic.com/code/widgets/use/.

This type of question would be a good one to search for an answer to
at http://wordpress.org/support/ .

Recent versions of WordPress (2.1) bundle the scripting files needed,
and activating the widgets plugin should be all that is needed.

If you are using WP 2.1 and still having a problem, please include
what the symptom of your problem is when you post to the support
forum.

Hope that helps,
Lloyd

This is not even close to the place to ask. You need to ask in the 
WordPress Support Forums http://www.wordpress.org/support or contact 
Automattic through their contact page directly. It could have been an 
error in your download, so do attempt to download this again.

I will forward the message on, but that's the proper procedure. This 
mailing list is for documentation of the WordPress manual, the WordPress 
Codex, only, not for support questions.

Subject: [wp-docs] Hotlinking Images from the Codex
Message-ID: <45F99C39.9060800@cameraontheroad.com>

The Template Hierarchy article featured a hotlinked image added recently 
from ScoutPress. 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy#Visual_Overview . I have 
some concerns over the issue of hotlinking images from the Codex:

1. Hotlinking images is bad manners no matter who does it and why. There 
is plenty of room on the Codex storage space to add more images to the 
Codex, so why not store them there? Or should we?

2. Hotlinking the image steals bandwidth and can take longer for pages 
to load. Why bother?

3. It isn't pretty when the image overwhelms the page and the visitor 
has to scroll around inside the iframe to see it. And due to its size, 
scroll a long ways past it to get to the rest of the content. Just ughly.

As it stands now on that article, I've put a thumbnailed (but large 
enough to be visible) image in, replacing the huge version. My version 
has been uploaded to the Codex. There are two links to view the full 
size image that cause the visitor to leave the Codex in order to view 
the image, though they could just download it from the original author's 
site for viewing later, remaining on the Codex.

The decisions we need to make in order to form some policies around such 
wonderful but questionable offerings are:

1. Should we permit hotlinked images from the Codex?
2. How should links to offsite viewing of full size images be featured, 
advising the reader that the link will take them off the Codex?
3. I haven't found a way to create an automatic thumbnail with MediaWiki 
to a hotlinked offsite image file. I had to create a thumbnail and 
upload it to the Codex first. This is double effort. Anyone had any 
success in this?
4. What other technical and "moral" aspects do we need to consider for 
including a hotlinked image or offsite content in the WordPress Codex?

Opinions? Advice?

I don't think so, embedded images should live on wp.org, and external 
images should just be a href links.
