Message-ID: <05488a8c3716b43ec7ad55c8d2b5986d@macmerc.com>

Hey, it's me, the guy who does most of the work on Themes list.  And, 
I'm thinking about just deleting the whole thing.

[rant]
Why?  Because it takes up my free time and all I get in return are 
reminders that it's nothing but a "laundry list" and psychotic 
out-of-nowhere-style insults whenever I mention the Codex and themes in 
the same sentence.  So, would someone like to inform me why I need this 
stress?
[/rant]

::sigh:: Anywho, that's where I stand right now.  BTW, did you guys 
know that the Codex has "no quality control"?  
http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=29373#post-166518

It's just a thought right now.  But, there obviously are better Themes 
lists out there, and we have linked to all of them in the Codex.  
::shudder:: Oh no, I said "Themes" and "Codex" in the same sentence 
again.  ::brace for insults::

1. The posting you referred to is from someone I find offensive and 
unhelpful in the forums and I avoid that person as much as possible.  The 
trouble, inaccuracies, and spiteful nature of the posts in general makes my 
blood boil, so I practice extreme patience and avoidance of this person.  I 
would also not pay attention to anything said by this person for those 
reasons.

2.  Volunteers, as you know, are working long hours to make sure that the 
information on the Codex is as accurate as possible.  Since we are all 
volunteers, things might not happen as fast as we'd like, but we are doing 
our best and I think that steps to ensure quality control are high.  And 
again, that person is speaking out of a hole where the sun don't shine as 
far as I'm concerned.

3.  The work of constantly including themes in the Codex is brutal, and I 
have been of the opinion that the thankless job of maintaining these is 
horrific as they continue to expand.  I think that the other sites that have 
cropped up are doing a fine job and the whole game of making the Codex the 
"official holder of the theme list" isn't what the Codex is about, but I'm 
not in charge, just offering an opinion.  The Codex, for me, is about 
documentation and resources and if someone else is having fun and keeping up 
a good list, then let them.  Or create a site dedicated to themes, as many 
have done, and make that one official.

4.  Of all the things WordPress does, theme building is the one area where 
there is no quality control.  While many take steps to ensure that their 
themes validate cross browsers and meet web standards and do only good 
things in them, they are up to the individual user and if WP starts getting 
into the practice of saying "this one is approved" and having it screw up 
later - where's the liability going to rest. These are use at your own risk 
things. I think they are brilliant, but if the Codex is to remain the 
official documentation, that word "official" carries a big stick.  Just 
something to consider.

5. James, and others who have worked hard on maintaining plugins and themes, 
a never ending job, you are appreciated.  Greatly.  I would hate to see your 
labors be stopped because of the careless words of a careless person.  No 
matter how hard your efforts have been, I'm glad you brought this up because 
the Codex shouldn't be all things to all people.  It is documentation, as 
far as I'm concerned, and information people can use, and if such lists are 
better maintained elsewhere with links to them from the Codex, I gots no 
problem with that.  And it isn't personal, it's just a matter of putting 
energies where they are best needed.  No matter what the decision by the 
majority or the powers that be, you and your work are sincerely appreciated. 
We just have to look at the big picture.

6.  There is a lot of stress in the WP inner world right now, some of it 
justified, some of it totally blown out of proportion, and I'm not liking 
the repercussions I see everywhere.  People are taking things personally and 
privately, making snap emotional decisions based upon little or no 
information and a lot of rumor and conjecture.  Calmness, folks.  Remember 
the reason you got involved in the first place and let the dust settled.  Do 
good work, contribute what energies you have and help others to continue on 
with your work - this should be the mission statement of everyone who gets 
involved with volunteer efforts, period.  Do this for the fun and ignore the 
mean-spirited idiots out there that don't understand the joy of 
contribution.

Hang in there, and let's make this a positive discussion because it's 
important to get it right and help everyone understand why.

My 2 cents.

Personal attacks best belong on blogs, if at all :) Let's get above
our differences. There is nothing we can do to stop them, or change
individuals' attitudes. Codex, and the documentation/support process
still depends on a very few people, most of whom are _extremely_
active, and put in a large number of hours.

The work you do is irreplaceable, but should you think that
maintaining the list of themes is not something you can do anymore,
then everybody would understand why you had to stop.

I could work for a week non-stop on the Codex, and still not be
entirely satisfied with the quality or completeness, and I haven't
been working on the Codex for a long stretch of time now, due to
professional demands. I will try and improve things when I can, and
until such time, I stand and wonder at the efficiency and work of
others.

Thanks a lot for all the work.

I've not been around for awhile and was absent from Wiki Weekend due to 
last minute commitments in the 'real world' :), but I moved in 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels yesterday.  I did not 
move in the Links Panel and SubPanels since that  content is, for 
better or for worse, essentially duplicated in [[Links Manager]]; those 
links from [[Administration Panels]] still point to my user space and 
need to be changed.

I've not linked to [[Administration Panels]] and the SubPanels from any 
other Codex document and would appreciate it if people made those links 
when they see one would be appropriate.  Recall, though, that these 
pages don't often address 'how to do X', but instead 'what is this X 
and what can I do with it?'.

Well, I've thought about this for awhile now and today it becomes an issue.
Seems the Codex is down at the moment for whatever reason, it might not be a
bad idea if we can discuss a mirroring solution where changes made to the
Codex can be exported to other servers that can continue to provide service
during downtime. Not sure how technically feasible that is but I have server
space and can donate it as one possible mirror site.

 

I guess I need to hear from the devs, particularly Matt, how possible this
is.

 

Let me know.

Message-ID: <1112587827.6755.14.camel@portnoy.fuzzybelly.org>

Anyone started on 1.5.1 release notes?  I'm thinking we can pattern them
after the Firefox and GNOME release notes.

http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/1.0.2.html
http://gnome.org/start/2.10/

Things to mention on the front page of the release notes:

* Link to dev blog announcement.
* Where to get it.
* How to install it.
* Overview of what changed.
* Highlight any security bugs.
* Link to changelog for full list of bugs fixed.
* List changed files.
* List of known issues (Maybe just a link to open bugs in Mosquito.  We
won't have any big outstanding issues).

>From there, someone could write an short article on 1.5.1 along the
lines of:

http://gnome.org/start/2.10/notes/

Of course, we won't have nearly so much to say.

Also, a link to a list of credits.

Overview - I have been in and out, and would probably can take a first
shot at this. If someone else can do this, it would be great, and a
lot better, too.

Do we know of any that persist? Are all known XSS issues fixed?

Same page as above.

Right, that should be easy to do if the preceding items are completed.

> Also, a link to a list of credits.
This we should start building upon. 

Please feel free to use the Changelog/1.5.1 page to add details, or
use as a clip pad. We can reorganize stuff into different pages later,
if so desired. Lets get the info together.
 
Reminder: If the image uploads at Codex are restored, we could use new
screenshots. They often speak more than words :)

things out, I beleive. I welcome the ads - it is an easy way for me to

What does this mean, and has the documentation team powers been contacted

I imagine that's for pages like this:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/EventCalendar2

I even have one or two of these myself, afaik they're all sub-pages of 
Plugins.

Yami McMoots has written a great article on how to create an Archive index, 
and the steps can apply to a variety of different "specialty" pages in 
WordPress.  She wants to know where to "put it".

I think this is the kind of thing that would go great in the Lessons, as it 
is step by step instruction guide that would really help users.  But it 
could stand on it's own, too.  If set with other similar how-to articles, 
though, it would help users to find the information better.  What do you 
think?

Alright, 
So let's hear it -- Does anyone have any objections, or suggestions
with regard to create a new "section" for Lessons at the codex?
Possible candidates for the section are the wonderful articles by
Lorelle, most of which are very informative, and need not be
classified entirely as an article in one of the other "sections". The
idea is for articles which share what may be common knowledge and
resources about techniques and essential skills that the beginning
WordPress users may not be aware of. I personally think that Lessons
will teach folks how to fish, instead of feeding them fish, one at a
time.

If no one has any objections or suggestions, the section may be
created by Thursday April 7th (by me, Lorelle, or anyone else so
inclined).

Thank you,
Carthik.

Sounds like a fabulous idea to me. I for one, much prefer being taught how  
to fish, rather than being 'fed fish, one at a
  time' :-)

The other day i started working on my lap, for that... As far i have
the frontpage, but i havent uploaded (I edited the last spanish
frontpage, just copying the main frontpage)

I will also be good to add the translation bar at the bottom of every
page so is somebody goes to Plugins and selects spanish version can go
to es:Plugins ;)

Send me a email, to see where to begin...

Subject: [wp-docs] A Lessons Contest?
Message-ID: <000501c53abb$b804e0f0$6401a8c0@silver>

I love all the contests of late, and it got me thinking...I know DANGER....I 
don't know how to write plugins, and I've been way too busy redoing my 
entire site to mess with creating themes, and there must be other people out 
there who are like me but want to be a part of the competitive fun.

With the upcoming release of the Lessons in the Codex, can we talk about the 
possiblity of having a "WordPress Lesson" tip or trick contest?  NOT NOW, 
but in a couple of months to keep the contest energy flowing and enthusiasm 
going.  The month of May might be good. Or aim for something during the 
summer or fall.

I don't know how all these contests get going, finding sponsors and all, or 
really how this would work - hosted on an individual's site or on the Codex 
or in the Forums, but here are my current thoughts, if others think this is 
a neat idea.

We'd have to come up with some basic criteria that basically says that the 
tip or lesson must be of benefit to the majority of WordPress users, should 
related to a WordPress feature, should not include hacks or plugins, 
highlight template tags, template usage, conditional tags, the Loop, and so 
on.  Keeping it very WordPress specific, using criteria like I started in my 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User_talk:Lorelle discussion about the Lessons.

All applicable entries would be included in the Lessons section of the 
Codex.

This is just an idea and the start of a brainstorm, but it would help to 
make the Codex more "visible" to the WordPress Community, increase the 
benefit to users, and give non-tech folks a chance to compete in something 
related to WordPress.

Whatcha think?

I went through ALL of the template tags during the Wiki Weekend and put in 
at least three examples for all applicable tags with parameters, and when 
applicable, I added visual examples.  I'd love to have those checked to make 
sure the tag usage and examples are right....if you are really looking for 
something to do.

We still don't have pictures, especially on the 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/First_Steps_With_WordPress which I'm 
anxious to release.  The graphics are in the image upload area, but they are 
still not appearing on the page, except for one.  Carthik battled with this 
for a while, but they still aren't working.  I'd like to add graphics to 
some of the lessons, but I've held off uploading them until this is 
resolved.

Of the lessons I've currently posted, I am most in need of editing and 
review of 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Stepping_Into_Template_Tags 
(especially the information at the end of the article) and 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Styling_Page-Links, and a quick look 
at http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Next_and_Previous_Links would be 
wise.

I've also started a list on my User Page for other ideas, many beyond the 
current scope of my familiarity with how WordPress works.  I'd love to see 
more Tech, Features and Functions, and some really good tackles at the Loop, 
a thing that continues to confound me, so it must do the same for others.

Take your pick, but if this is going "public" sometime today, let's focus on 
what's done.

And thanks for asking.  These are just the things on my list.  I'm sure 
others have more.

How do you think the contest should work? We need to figure out some ground

The images are not working :
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-March/000336.html is
where I posted about this earlier.

I had a discussion at #mediawiki to figure out what's happening, and
someone there said that the Rewrite rules try to rewrite the URLs for
the thumbnails, preventing them from displaying. The message I have
quoted above provides an example. He said that part of the problem was
that all articles (the main namespace) is at the root, instead of, say
"wiki" as it is with wikipedia, for example.

I figure we could avoid this by preventing rewrites for /images/* .

Please go through the thread that included the post I quoted above
(starting from http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-March/000333.html
to be precise)

Thanks Matt,
Carthik.

If others on the list, like me, are in the habit of frequently
checking the recent changes page at the Codex to look for spammers or
vandals, or for errors in editing, please click the "Mark as
Patrolled" link after you have verified the edit on a page. This link
is available both on the diff showing the changes and the page itself,
I beleive.

This will remove the red "!" from the recent changes page, and it will
be easier to see which changes have been checked. It is not too much
additional work, if you already like to keep an eye on recent changes.

Thank you,
Carthik.

First Shot:

1) All entries should be released under an LGPL compatible license, so
they can be copied over to the Codex.
2) Write an entry anywhere (on your blog, or as a sub page of a user
page) and submit a link to a designated Codex page for the
competition.
3) There will be various types of prizes, for various
sub-competiotions (most user friendly doc, most useful doc, etc...)
4) It can run for a month
5) You can submit articles, help tutorials you have already written.
(this will help accumulate WP docs on the codex)

Regards,
Carthik.

One thought I had about this just now- There should be a significant 
prize for a first-time contributor.

Otherwise, we might as well all just trade prizes with each other.  ;)

I count myself out of the bidding for prizes, and would encourage
other contributors to do so, if they think it would improve things in
general.

Good point :) ,

I think trying to rank documentation in the same way you might try to 
rank plugins or themes wouldn't work well. I think the goal of the 
competition should be mainly to get more people who aren't currently 
involved in the Codex to overcome their fear and start contributing.

To that end, I think we should figure out some threshold for 
participation and then just pick a prize to randomly award to the pool 
of eligible participants.

"Most complete" might be a good metric, and could be applied to several 
different aspects of documentation:
* most complete walk-through

Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress Lessons are public
Message-ID: <000501c53d0d$211412c0$6401a8c0@silver>

I've put the WordPress Lessons out there at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons.  Please slash and burn these 
for the next week and then I will help Matt make a public announcement about 
them.

I've put a minimal criteria list on the discussion page with a list of 
Wanted Lessons.  If anyone here can quickly rip off one or two of these to 
add to the more technical aspects, it would help flesh out those areas which 
are lacking.  I've grouped these in vague categories to start, so if you see 
a category in need of addition, let me know.

Once these are up and running for a month, and we see how the response goes, 
we'll get the contest going to really bulk up the Lessons.

Oh, I just thought of one more criteria I'm going to add right now.  They 
must apply to version 1.5+!!! Yikes! So much to think about.

Now help us all with a few good Lessons!  Please?

Do we have an overview of ways to contribute to WordPress?  I'd like to
have something to link to from the contact page
(http://wordpress.org/about/contact/).  We currently refer people to
helpout@wordpress.org, but almost everything sent to that address would
be better handled on a mailing list or sent straight to the bug tracker.
Here's an outline of the ways to contribute.

Thanks, Ryan,

I moved it over, and filled it out the best I could in half an hour:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress

I beleive you can link to that page now from the contact page, if you so desire.

Any improvements to the page would be welcome. Please edit mercilessly :)

Subject: [wp-docs] Creating a Forum fair use page etc.
Message-ID: <80f75db050410135117b63c66@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

A small task for a free volunteer:

We need to merge in some stuff to the 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_support_forums
page.

The stuff that need to be merged in is the corresponding talk page :
http://codex.wordpress.org/Talk:Using_the_support_forums

Also, it would be great if someone could use stuff from 
http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/forum/ and 
http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/forumhelp/
(thanks Podz)

into 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Finding_WordPress_Help
or
http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_support_forums
whichever is best.


I beleive that a page describe forum fair use rules, and a seperate
page describing how to use the forums efficiently as a person asking
questions and as someone helping out at the forums would be great.
[[Finding WordPress Help]] can be a meta-article covering all bases.

Someone up for the task? I have been thinking of doing this for a
while, but never got the time, yet, so I thought I would throw it into
the open here.

Thank you,
Carthik.

Message-ID: <d3946d0e0f995edaee5a69807285c40f@macmerc.com>

I remember this was discussed before, but dropped somehow.  Would it be 
possible for someone to fix the thumbnail creation upon upload?  As you 
can see from the New Image Gallery: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Newimages the Codex stopped creating 
thumbnails with image uploads on March 13th.  If this could be fixed, 
pages such as "First Steps With WordPress" 
http://codex.wordpress.org/First_Steps_With_WordPress would be greatly 
improved.

Subject: [wp-docs] WP Groups
Message-ID: <002d01c53ec3$89501980$6401a8c0@silver>

I knew there were a couple of WordPress Groups out there, but not over 100 
different groups around the world. Wow.  Carthik has authorized me to write 
a synopsis about these groups for the Codex, and I think that after it is 
written, those with the "power" to put things on blogs which end up spread 
all over the place, should think about promoting these groups.  They are a 
powerful tool that WordPress needs.

So, to write the little article about the groups, I need information about 
the groups.  Anyone belong to one?  Familiar with one?  Attended a meeting? 
I need to know some stuff:

1. When was the first one formed, why, and where.
2. Have there been any articles or stories written about these groups?
3. How are the international groups doing?
4. Is there thought of an international annual or bi annual meetings of 
these different groups?
5. Other than discussion and WordPress projects and support, are there any 
benefits to joining these groups?
6. Which is the oldest?  Which has the most active members? Other highlights 
about these groups?
7. Other than using meetup.com to stay in touch, how else to they stay in 
touch with members?
8. Do they have guest speakers or just social time when they get together?

If you are a member or know of any group members, could you ask them to 
email me at lorelle at cameraontheroad.com and let me know about their group 
for the article.  Any little unique or fun tidbit that would make this a 
little more interesting would help.

Thanks,

Lorelle

Subject: [wp-docs] Troubleshooting Themes
Message-ID: <004a01c53ec4$18dce8d0$6401a8c0@silver>

A while ago I posted this message, but I didn't get any response.  I really 
need some help with this:

======
March 25, 2005

I'm going to put together a Troubleshooting Themes article for the Codex and
I need some help and input.  What problems or challenges have you
encountered installing and using themes?  If it is something like "I didn't
like the color of the header", we got that one.

We're looking for issues involving:

* Downloading and installing Themes

* Choosing and Viewing Themes - I'm hearing a lot of "uploaded them and now
I can't see the themes I uploaded" and "I chose my theme but there is
nothing but white on my screen - no theme" on the forums - I need to review
these for answers but if you know the answer - pop it in here!

* Theme Author Issues - Common design or coding mistakes and where to get
more help on these in addition to the Developing Themes articles

* Template Issues - Missing templates, damaged templates, replacing
templates, template for main page and categories but different for single,
template for main page and single but different for categories....

* Loop Issues - Changing from excerpt to whole post or reverse. Having the
Loop's conditional tags call single.php if single, category.php if category,
etc.

* Changing The Theme - where to look for which part in which templates,
using a sandbox, tracking down CSS references in the generated HTML and the
style.css.....

* Plugins in Themes - may cause problems if the plugin tag is present but
the plugin isn't activated. Other "plugins in themes" issues - specifically
downloaded themes with plugins not adding plugins to a theme afterwards.

* What else?  I know there is something or three I've missed.

I will also include links in the article to Troubleshooting CSS, Browser
Bugs, Theme Development and the rest.  I want to keep this similar to the
FAQ so it is question and answer solutions or more information.

Pitch in and pick up the shovel folks - I need some questions and answers on
these issues so I can maybe take a good crack at it this Wiki Weekend.

Subject: [wp-docs] PHP Syntax Highlighting on Codex
Message-ID: <835be1c005041313046d7e78ba@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I've seen (e. g. here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Template_Tags/comments_link&action=edit&section=2
) that we can use three percentage signs (%%%) on the codex to get PHP
highlighted.

Is there anyone who can tell me where to get that plug in for
Mediawiki (so we can install it on the German WP Doku as well)?

Regards,
Christian

I think the above link references the original work. Since we dont
have the old docs@wordpress.org archives (or at least I cant find
them) I cannot find the original mail in which I suggested/recommended
the highlighting.

Good luck with the dokuwiki!
Hope that helps,

Carthik.

Hi!
Carthik, thanks for the hint, but after doing a search on google for
"syntax" on the archives I found this:

Are you sure it's safe to apply that "hack" to MediaWiki or are we
going to get a "snail wiki" as a result...?

Thanks,

Thanks Michael, I gave up after a few google searches - gave up too early :)
Christian, that is what is being used at the Codex presently, and
really, the problem could have been due to some other effects of the
process that Matt used - collateral damage, if I may say so. Please
ask Matt, or wait for his reply as to whether the hack damages the
wiki, if you are not sure.

Lorelle,

Shouldn't you be just able to use META tags on the pages you don't
want indexed by search engines?

 <META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX">

Doing it per-page is probably better than centrally excluding all user pages.

Cheers,
+ Kim

Don't the Meta Tags have to be in the head, though?

Codex does not allow one to define the head of documents.

User pages being indexed means that incomplete articles with potentially

understand the gist of this.

Perhaps we've reached a point where we need a general workspace where 
draft documents can be created and worked on, then see if Matt can tweak 
MediaWiki to close this area off from the search bots.

In reply to Matt's questions, as well as in general, I still stand by
what I said earlier about articles being released reasonably early.
While it is good to "release" finished articles, it can be better to
put partially complete articles in the Main namespace so that other
users can work on it, if they desire. I added a whole lot of links and
finished an article that was created and left as a stub the other day
(Weblog clients, i think it was)...

That is the nature of the beast (the wiki). This is why we did away
with userpages in the first place.

Message-ID: <00bb01c54294$86f7ffc0$6401a8c0@silver>

I hear this "release early" garbage over and over, which I think is arrogant
and harmful.  Honestly.  Release early means putting stuff "out there" with
the potential to be very wrong, waiting for someone to pay attention to the
material and fix it.  Without the huge body of volunteers who are directed
and "motivated" to keep track of their areas and maintain timely inspections
and edits, an article can sit there for ages before someone pays attention
to it.

Combine this with the issue that I made this "whine" because I found my user
pages listed in Google in 2 days after posting.  They might have been
grabbed within MINUTES of my posting - I don't know, but if it made it in
the top 20 to my unrelated Google search, it was a FAST grab.  I had already
posted in this mailing list and in the discussion areas of the articles that
this information needed help desperately.  And now it was out as "fact" on
the web.

Can we reasonably expect volunteers to leap upon a document to correct it
within 24 hours of posting?  "Release early" is not even a realilty and
makes no sense.

Yet, I write this note with the assumption and expectation that the goal of 
the WordPress Codex is to offer higher quality information and resources 
than a free-for-all Wiki.  I thought that is why it isn't the WordPress Wiki 
any more.

If the user's can't have a "protected" (whatever that means) area so they
can sandbox their ideas and work on them in order to maintain the intergrity
of the Codex, then we need to get more structured with
the Codex volunteers.  I recommend that volunteers "sign up" for specific
areas as "editors" to that area.  It can be based upon the different
sections on the Main Page, or subsections.  I can't image the person(s) in
charge of the plugins and themes would manage the whole "department" as
their task is neverending.  So the most "energy draining" areas should have
their own captains.  Either as a single editor or "team", they would work
out a way of consistently monitoring every new document that pops into their
area for accuracy and consistency.

I say this for a few reasons.  This is not a blame or blast at anyone, but
facts proving The Release Early Theory doesn't hold water.  The Wiki Weekend 
was
highly promoted and then fell down totally.  I've posted links to articles 
on this mailing list
that require specific help or general review and have seen little or no
evidence of any work on them, even when I know it needs a fix.  I have even
had to request more than twice before getting a response.  Without some form 
of
organization, even free-form, things slip through the cracks.

Every volunteer organization, when it reaches the point that WordPress has,
must start delegating responsiblity and authority, often with titles, so
people know where to turn for help and guidance, as well as a good CYA
happens to make sure everything works right.

Again, this is not a condemnation but an encouragement to get our act
together, let some leaders rise to the top so they can, in turn, mentor the
up and comings folks, so they replace themselves and the process continues
on into the future with pride and authority.

As a long time editorial and technical writer, no matter how "perfect" my 
work is, or how much they pay me, it goes through a process of review and 
editing before it reaches the "public".  Much is done to make sure it is as 
"right as possible" before release.  So this is standard operating 
procedure, not some "let's control the Codex" issue.  If it means we 
actually email the stuff to and from each other before it is released, fine. 
If it means that it's posted on this mailing list for direct review....that 
is also grabbed by search engines from the archives. If there is a secure 
area for people to review and edit directly on the Codex, without fear of 
errors getting into the public and giving WordPress a bad name...then let's 
do that. Either way, to have the highest quality documentation we can get 
from this awesome team of experienced and knowledgeable people who want only 
the best and their best out there - something has to happen.

Wouldn't an easy fix be to mark the document as draft, e.g. at the top?

Penalizing all User space documents because of drafts seems wrong. 
For example, Matt has some very interesting documents in his User:Matt
space.

See if you go to the blogger blogs they have a box right below the
title of your post for you to add any URL that you want to people to
go to when they click on the title, I want to do the same thing for my
word press blog.  Has anyone written a plug in for this or can anyone
make one for me?

THIS IS WHERE I POSTED THIS ON THE SUPPORT SITE:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=31200

I have posted this on the support page many times without any solution.

++++++++++++++++
SECOND PROBLEM:
++++++++++++++++

If you go to all of my URLs on my blog:

All Posts
Any catagory
Any Date

The links that I have below the pages all show up.

Pages

Can you tell me about Davids FREE System Trading eZines or Newsletters 
My System Trading Blog and RSS FEED that Answers the Question What is RSS

THIRD PROBLEM:
++++++++++++++++

According to:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Logout

ITS SAYS:
If you have a WordPress cookie set in your web browser, anyone using
your computer can access the Adminstration Panels of your blog. If you
don't want this to happen (perhaps you are using a public computer or
a computer which other people use), you can click this Logout link,
and WordPress will delete the cookie from your web browser.

I have two different user names.

I can't logout and log into my other user name. I clicked the logout
button in the Dashboard and it just does not work.

Help! 

I ALSO POSTED THIS OVER HERE:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=30557

OH PLEASE I AM WONDERING IF ANYONE CAN HELP!

On the brighter side of things at least I am learning how to use PHP files.

David,
Sorry, this isn't the right place for any technical support for WordPress.
This is the mailing list for work on the documentation that supports
WordPress.  I've seen some of your posts in the WordPress Support Forum and
I know people are trying to help.  Be patient.  We are all volunteers.

In keeping with this mailling list, you might find many of the answers you
seek in the WordPress Codex at http://codex.wordpress.org, the main
documentation site for WordPress and the purpose of this mailing list.  Good
luck with your problem.  Be patient. And if you are really in a hurry, try
the ICQ chat for WordPress at channel #wordpress.

I understand Linus's Law as it relates to programming, which basically boils 
down to the theory that many heads can solve many problems that one head 
can't.  With documentation, people assume that what is in print is RIGHT, 
whether it is 5 seconds old for 4000 years old....look at religion.  ;-)

This is why it is so important to have the information as close to right as 
possible before released.  I'm not talking about missed spells or grammar or 
even the farkled sentence structure that impossible sounds written 
when....I'm talking about the power of the written word to be immortal. 
This the little different from rumours and gossip.  Once said, it is 
believed.  Once written, well, then it must be true.

I will be much more cautious about what I release in the future, which means 
it will take a lot longer between releases of information related to 
WordPress because I have to go find the correct information and research 
things instead of putting it out there and asking someone to help me get it 
right.

I just wish there was a better procedure for handling this process, like 
I've mentioned before.  For instance, I know that Kaf is now the honcho 
behind much of the template tags, so I can go to him and say "did I screw 
this up or is it right", it takes a couple of minutes of both of our 
time...sometimes...and then it can be released to the public with some 
assurance that an expert checked out my claim and it was right.  But I have 
no idea who is in charge of plugins, themes, developers stuff...none of 
those areas where help might be needed.

Well, enough on this.  It's critically important for the survival of the 
process to know who to turn to when and how to handle the release of 
documentation, and this has to happen soon.

What specifically do you want prioritized?  I've been digging more and
more into plugin writing, and have been meaning to help flesh out the
list of plugin hooks and how to use them.

I'd be happy to take a break from that, though, to focus on something a
little more immediately useful to the bulk of users.

Subject: [wp-docs] Starting a Codex translation
Message-ID: <ee3906a05042020287609f2a6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

With a quick search I didn't see anything that would say where to
start translating, so I created this:

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Kim/Entry_Points_from_WordPress

A couple of questions:

1) Is there already a list like that on Codex?
2) How do I rename a page (other than cut&paste)?

If anyone has information to add, especially about having audited the
WP code for Codex links, that would be great.

I've gotten a lot of feedback, help, improvements and suggestions for
the Finnish translation from Minna(*) and she was asking where to help
with it, so I suggested taking a look at the Codex pages.  I'm hoping
that while we (and telling from her speed, that's probably going to be
"she") start the Finnish translation, we can provide some sort of a
roadmap for others to follow.

Regards,
+ Kim

P.S.  If there is a MediaWiki intro (which I should've Google'd for
already but haven't) or something I should go read, the URL's would be
most welcome (and will get added to the roadmap).

It'd be ideal if we could use the language bar thing for this.

All of those are in strings that are marked for translation (I just
marked the string containing Enable_Sending_Referrers.  Do we want to
mark the links in admin-footer and the dashboard so that translators can
make them point to native language resources (such as
channel.wordpress.de and forum.wordpress.de for the German translation)?

I think that's an excellent idea we should explore more, I don't think 
it's right for 1.5.1 yet though. Just like we have maintainers for the 
different translations we need international webmasters/project leaders 
for the different efforts, particularly if they're going te live on 
countrycode.wordpress.org. I think longer term that's the best solution.

Message-ID: <011e01c5467b$59846de0$6401a8c0@silver>

Okay, we're going to go public with WordPress Lessons as of Monday.  A 
couple of people have put in requests to get in some last minute Lessons to 
flesh out some of the technical areas and I want to get that in so when the 
Lessons go public, we have a little more meat on the bone.

So this means that if you have something for the WordPress Lessons on the 
Codex, let me know right away.

I've also put forth a couple of pages in my user section that might be used 
for future WordPress Lesson submissions at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_for_WordPress_Lessons and 
in the discussion of the same page.  I may consolidate both the discussion 
into the article, but the purpose of these is to start to look at how to 
handle submissions for these, since we want them to be as accurate as 
possible, criteria (we really want to avoid duplicate efforts, unrelated 
topics, and self promotion or bragging rights), If you see something on 
there that you'd like to do, please sign up so we can kinda test out how 
these test pages work and keep things on track until this really gets going. 
The criteria there might also help us think ahead into the contest phase 
we've already discussed.

So jump in with both feet folks.  I gots to have the stuff by Sunday in 
order to edit and get it out there so we have something worthy to show off 
on Monday.  Thanks!!!

Per suggestion on this discussion, I've created a {{Draft}} template.  It

trust everything in it".  To use it, add {{Draft}} at the top of your page. 
I've also tried to create a category for Drafts like the CopyEdit so we can 
actually have a list we can look at to see what needs editing in draft 
form...but I'm sure I screwed it up so would a sysop please fix it.

A few problems, with unexpected strings, the things you have listed aren't 
necessarily the case. Some thing, such as not putting semicolons at the end 
of a line can trigger some of these errors. An also important one to list 
would be header errors that are often attributed to plugins

It'll be a major undertaking to provide a comprehensive debugging guide.
 I'd like to provide some pointers for the sorts of things that
generally crop up due to user error, and not (necessarily) logic errors.

Syntax mistakes can be a bear for a frustrated newbie to chase down; but
if we can give them a few pointers for the kinds of things the error
messages generally mean, they might better help themselves.

Now the Codex is more and more complex, i.e. having the answer for the
majority of newbie questions, I think it would be a good idea to
change the links in the different WP files that point to the support
forum for help - with links that lead to the Codex.

Many times new users come to the forum with questions for which the
only possible answer is to provide a URI to the Codex. And the nature
of the questions tells they have never been there. So, why waste
energy, space, time? Direct them to the Codex first!

The links in the admin have already been updated to the codex (in 
svn/nightlies especially, seen a few patches that changed links around), and 
there was talk of adding some more (?) next to some features that pointed to 
the codex.

This is a great idea, Skippy. Just remember, we aren't a replacement for the major PHP sites, so let's list the MOST common errors, and try to keep them as related as possible to WordPress.  It's a fine line we walk with this one.

And to everyone else, if you know of some great external resources that list common PHP error charts or information, please post it here or add it to the discussion area of the article so Skippy can check them out and add them to his article.  This way, we can cover our bases without becoming the PHP error repository.

Great work and thanks to everyone for the help!

Could you let us know which "pages" in the Codex are on the list for the new version?  That way we can double, triple, and fintuple check to make sure they are accurate and "safe".  Thanks.

For those on the cutting edge of our cutting editors...these are the pages 
we have to make sure are primo:

 * http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrade_1.2_to_1.5
* http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC
* http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_from_other_blogging_software
* http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support
* http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API
* http://codex.wordpress.org/Enable_Sending_Referrers
* http://codex.wordpress.org/Spam_Words
* http://codex.wordpress.org/Make_a_Directory_Writable
* http://codex.wordpress.org/Update_Services

There will probably be alink added to [[Using Themes]] soon.

With the new generated interest in the next release, I think we should add 
to that list:
http://www.codex.wordpress.org/Plugins
And everything in http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress

Just my two cents.

Hi!
Can I just throw the following link into the discussion - I believe it 
_might_ be of relevance:
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=248
I requested there some time ago that links from within the admin screen 
ought to be changable via language files...
Regards,
Christian
P.S.: I'm not sure, but I think we actually do already insert a link to 
WP.de next to the original WP.org <http://wp.org/> footer...

I know the weekend is coming, but for those of you with a few minutes to 
spare over the weekend, especially Sunday and Monday, can you stop by the 
WordPress Lessons at http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons and do 
some editing and verifying?  The documents there need checking, and I'll be 
moving in more over the weekend, so all editing would be seriously 
appreciated.

And if you are writing any articles for the Lessons in time for the big 
"media blitz" for WordPress Lessons on Monday, I absolutely have to have 
them by Sunday in order to clean them up and make sure they are stuck on a 
page.

Thanks!  This is going to be a fun section on the Codex, and very helpful to 
a lot of people.

Carthik asked me to find some "lost" articles and improve them, and consider 
adding them to Lessons.  I found a few that are kinda lost out there and I 
wanted to give them new life by incorporating them into the new WordPress 
Lessons.  But I don't want to do it without approval.  They will still be 
valid wherever they are, they will just be listed under Lessons, which will 
help people learn more about how to use WordPress.  In other words, it's a 
"higher page rank link" ;-).

Any recommendations on others?  And is this okay to do?

Subject: [wp-docs] Overwhelming?
Message-ID: <426CE6E2.5000600@skippy.net>

I started at the WordPress Lessons page:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons
which is chock-full of information.  I hadn't read "First Steps with
WordPress" in a while, so I clicked there:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/First_Steps_With_WordPress
also chock-full of information.  Reading all of these two pages (which I
didn't do) would take me a fair amount of time.

>From First Steps, I clicked on "how all of this works", which takes me to:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/Working_with_WordPress

I've been using WordPress for about a year now, and feel fully
comfortable with it.  But I feel overwhelmed trying to follow the
documentation.  I've no idea what to suggest as a starting point for my
mom, a fledgling WordPress user and a person entirely too busy to read
all of this stuff.

Don't get me wrong: it's _fantastic_ that we have such a wealth of
information.  I wonder, though, if we can find a slightly more linear
presentation method so as not to inundate the fledgling bloggers with
too many links to too much information?
Maybe we could tease out some of the information from Codex into a (PDF?
 HTML?) "WordPress Guidebook", which users could read offline (or print).

_Huge kudos_ to Carthik, Lorelle, and all the codex contributors.  I am
simply amazed at the quality and quantity of the information.

I've emailed Matt the release for the WordPress Lessons, and I expect them 
to get a lot of attention.  Just so you know, and might want to use, here is 
the press release.  If you would like to post it on your site, feel free to 
help spread the word.  Edit, slice, dice, and rearrange however you want to 
customize the end result so we don't have a bunch of repeated info out 
there.

Also, thanks to everyone (and you know who you are) who jumped in during the 
last few days to crunch out some new HOT articles for the Lessons and did 
great editing of the material so it will be as high caliber as possible. 
We're still looking for new WordPress Lesson articles and if you would like 
to contribute, visit my user page at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_for_WordPress_Lessons for a 
list of what we're looking for, a signup area, and information on how this 
all works.

WordPress Lessons
While < a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> comes ready-to-use 
out of the box, if you are tempted to customize your WordPress site, a peek 
under the hood might intimidate you. Suddenly your simple desire to change a 
font, change the way categories are displayed, add text to the front page 
that won't appear on any other pages, or even figure out how to link from 
one post to another seems a daunting task in the face of all that PHP, HTML 
and CSS code.
Don't worry. WordPress is here to help. The official documentation site, <a 
href="http://codex.wordpress.org/">The WordPress Codex</a>, has just opened 
a new section dedicated to helping beginner and intermediate WordPress users 
customize their site and learn more about how WordPress works. <a 
href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons">WordPress Lessons</a> 
will help guide you step-by-step through the various processes of using 
WordPress, including:

There's no trackback but I wanted you to know it's up. 
http://www.reportica.net/news/ None of my customers will come but I wanted 
to give you the linky momentum. Good luck with your grand opening. I will 
look at the 404 article on Wednesday. I also have an exceedingly basic 
WordPress Tip of the Day for the totally clueless, if you want basic, let me 
know and I'll add you. This is well below the level of what you call a 
beginner.

The general standpoint is that WordPress is very easy to get the hang 
of if you just spend 30 minutes getting to know it.  The general point 
of the WordPress Lessons are to provide you with every last tiny 
detail, just in case you missed something.  Think of them as those 
books like, "Microsoft Office for Dummies", or "Internet Explorer: The 
Missing Manual".  Those are two programs that you shouldn't need a 
manual for, yet they still manage to turn out 200-300 page books that 
do come in handy for some users.

I am working on that now. The audience for what you are talking about is 
Users as differentiated from Webmasters. I love the codex, I love the style, 
and the content is exactly what I need, it's top notich, I appreciate it so 
much. 

But I'd never be able to send my clients there. They will never go beyond 
the user interface they are presented with. They don't want to go to other 
web sites or theme web sites, they don't want to understand more than what 
they need to do on that page. 

So I'm writing up exactly that, two pages that start with 1) changing your 
password to something easier to remember... really basic stuff. 

Essentially the people who will come to codex will be the support people, 
not their users. And in fact you probably want that.

(I'm new here, but you probably don't want webmasters installing WordPress, 
charging for it, and sending their clients with their very basic. "What is 
my password?" questions to the free forums. Many people actually do not 
understand that the people that they pay to host/install are not paying the 
people running the forum. I go out of my way to mention that to each client. 
I can provide you with the write-up I hand out on that.)

Also the dashboard is very confusing to some of these users. Rather than 
turn that dashboard to my own site, perhaps we could offer a user-level 
'channel' that the installer could set by default one way or the other. 
(Users could change that.) Some examples of user-level articles would be 
"How do I keep my links fresh?" 

So if you set up a
I-can't-codex.wordpress.org<http://t-codex.wordpress.org>(that's a
joke) with that attitude of 'we support the support people.' that
might work. A dedicated section to that. "Resources for Supporting WordPress 
End-Users."

And on every page, put "For more information, contact the person who is 
responsible for supporting your local installation of WordPress." And leave 
space for them to customize it. I have lots of really really basic stuff you 
could use in that way.

Am I being silly, or unfriendly to end users you may welcome?

By the way, has anyone considered:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#FDL
a GNU free documentation license for all this.

A PDF is OK as an alternate format. 

The questions people have are so basic... My number one problem is that 
people get upset when they get a request to approve spam for moderation, 
they don't realize it's not already viewed by their visitors. So I'll need 
to edit that notification text.

The Codex is Fabulous, WordPress is fabulous and it's very user-friendly. 
Don't get me wrong. I love Codex and need it myself. 

But about 1/2 my clients are not at that level and if you want support 
material that assumes the user will never leave the user interface, that's a 
different animal. 

The trouble is if you provide it at that level, YOU can be confused with the 
person who can bring the mysql database up when it goes down, or make files 
writable. At the level, they don't know which problems you cover and which 
you don't. So it's important to provide the materials, not directly, but for 
support people to give to their users at that level. I'm speaking from 
experience here, but your experience and goals for the codex may be 
different. That's OK.

Is this clear? I'm new here, I don't want you to think I don't love the 
codex. I'm responding to the guy who was asking for something for his mom.

I have stuff at that level if you want it. I'd have to go through it to 
remove references to Reportica before sending it on, I"m thinking Wednesday 
night. We're talking about people who don't know that they can copy the 
address of a website from their browser's address bar and paste it into 
wordpress (URI: field) when they add a link. Really b a s i c.

I've posted about FDL before on my own site, avoiding mentioning of it 
here.  These comments tend to bring out the (often hostile) remarks such 
as, "I've put so much effort into this, why should Joe Schmoe be able to 
offer a version for print and make money off of my sweat?"

That said, I think FDL is a good idea for Codex.  Likewise, I think it 
would be nice to work together toward a print version of Codex - 
something that the sales of which could contribute toward the community.

Even I wouldn't mind an IRL reference book for WordPress, even if it 
gets completely stale in 6 months.

Don't underestimate your mother.  People tend to like hand-holding 
information and the Codex it totally packed with core step-by-step technical 
help.  The Lessons are like having a conversation with someone to help them, 
putting things in the most simplest of terms.

And when the DAMN IMAGES GET FIXED (subtle hint there to the sysops), then 
the text will be broken up with graphics to help visualize every step of the 
way.  That will really help your mother, and you. I got a bunch of screen 
shots that are just waiting on hold to be uploaded as soon as the images 
feature of the Codex is fixed.

Most of them are totally step-by-step, especially the 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Template_Tags which shows examples 
of what things should look like, not just the code that makes them look that 
way.

And we always need more....NOT A SUBTLE HINT! ;-)

I won't be able to help til the weekend, between kids and work my weeks are 
full. Going on a field trip tomorrow at 6 AM.

Mothers, grandmothers, I don't underestimate. Doctors I do. They want full 
service ( http://www.stdp.org/news ) if something requires them to do more 
than punch OK they want it done for them. Some of them. Some turn this into 
a hobby and do fine. But I still need a manual to give them. So I wrote up 
something really basic.

The Codex is licensed under the GPL, the same license of WP itself. When 
I looked into GFDL it was really weird and seemed to be incompatible 
with the GPL itself, so keeping everything under GPL is cleanest.

Yes, I agree, I think the GFDL was designed for commercial publishers to 
make it easy for them to make their core text available to the community. 
That's why it's weird. It allows them to have sections that are not included 
(about us, etc.) ...

Trust me, I've been working on it. We're at the mercy of the wiki engine 
here, and it's being very unfriendly. I can't even upgrade because I'm 
getting a weird parse error.

Okay image uploading seems to work, even though it gives a SQL error.

Hi, just want to share with you that we are using techniques learned at
the sprint to help with the documentation efforts.

Results of the survey are here:

Hi, I'm new to the list.  I wrote up this fairly advanced howto (which 
as presented requires serious admin privileges) on how to move wp-admin 
completely onto an encrypted connection for all transactions: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_administration_over_SSL

I'd appreciate any and all feedback.

Thanks,

David:

Thank you for the article.  People are slicing and dicing it now, I hope, 
and it is VERY much appreicated. Good work, and great work keeping a 
border-line off topic issue being directly related to WordPress users.  We 
need more like this, aimed at the heart of WordPress users.

Wonderful!

Lorelle

Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress Lessons are a hit!
Message-ID: <000501c54c23$af33efb0$6401a8c0@silver>

The "official" release date for information about the new WordPress Lessons 
was on Monday.  It's Thursday and I thought I'd let you know that Google 
reports about 1,870 for "wordpress lessons".  Yahoo reports 1,250, and MSN 
reports 862.

According to the Codex's Popular Pages, listing visitor statistics, the 
table of contents page for WordPress Lessons has had 8164 views and is 
currently 36th most popular.

Not bad for so few days.  Keep spreading the word.

I will be putting together a small group to help put together the goals and 
objectives for the upcoming "WordPress Lessons Contest", that will happen in 
a month or so.  If you are interested in being a part of the team, helping 
with the concept, screening, editing, judging, whatever, let me know here or 
via email at lorelle@cameraontheroad.com.

Don't forget, while these lessons are merely step-by-step conversational 
articles that point people towards the serious documentation, we still need 
plenty of documentation pages to support those Lessons.  Keep the great work 
coming!
