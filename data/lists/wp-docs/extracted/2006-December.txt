I'm moving the Codex to a new host. Don't edit too much.

Is this worthy a temp. sticky @ the forums?  Regarding temp downtime,
perfomance, with a quick message that the move *should* address some
previous issues?

The Codex has now been moved to Automattic servers and is running 100x 
faster.

What's next...

Is anyone still on this list?

Is anyone interesting in contributing to the Codex, and if so what do 
you think needs to be fixed first?

Are there any technical wishlist items?

I'm new with WordPress, Matt.  Right now I'm busy converting our site to 
WordPress, so I've been making small Codex edits as I spotted them.

When I started (and still now, somewhat) my big confusion with Codex was 
that some links don't take me to the material I'm looking for; they take 
me to another page full of links.  I read a long discussion of this 
somewhere; some people felt that this design was logical.  Still, I just 
get lost.  My last idea on that discussion was that links to pages full 
of links might be flagged somehow -- with a little icon, or the string 
"(links)" as part of the link's anchor text, or something to let me know 
to "watch out; this is the start of a twisty passage..."

If I can break some time loose, I'd be glad to contribute however else. 
  Thanks a lot for WordPress and the Codex!

I've added CrazyEgg to the footer for non-logged in users so we should

Aanii Matt

Thank you for your updates.  I can start to do videos as we discussed after Dec 15th.  I am creating some new ones and will email you a link as soon as they are done.

However you asked about other contributions to the codex.  I think the outdated How To sections need to be done right.  I could also work on them as I do the videos if you'd like. Again after Dec 15th.

I can also take another look at the codex if you want me to and let you know specifically what needs to be worked on.  It's up to you.

I am willing to help in anyway I can.

Blessings
Bluedolphin

Awesome! Thanks Matt! :) ;)  As for what's next, and the wishlist items.. I had mentioned before, about maybe making the MonoBook theme, the default theme?
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2006-November/001353.html

I think it will be nicer to everyone, and not just the normal Codex editors, and volunteers..? 
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2006-November/001351.html

As for other things, the sky is the limit. With it being on a better server now, I think more will jump into the Codex, and start tidying(editing) things up. ;) :)  Thanks again for moving it, Matt. ;) :)

That's really good to hear. Thanks for contributing.

I agree, it'd be nice if the links on the front page of wordpress.org 
and more links on the Codex homepage took you directly to content.

Honestly probably not going to happen. It's really jarring to folks to 
go to something that looks completely different than the rest of the 
site when going to documentation.

For volunteers, the text area is currently narrower due to the third 
column, but I could probably put that back into the last column and make 
it wider.

If nothing else, how about fixing up the theme that currently exists
then. For one, short columns cause nasty looking pages. See
http://codex.wordpress.org/ThisPageDoesntExist

I'm sure spencer and others will have requests for things to change to
make the codex better looking and more accessible to all while
retaining the wp.org appearance.

Top of my wishlist is:

Adding the styles for displaying diffs properly to the codex theme - the
monobook theme has this - and it makes reviewing and checking changes
much easier as the context is actually highlighted correctly:

table.diff { background:white; }
td.diff-otitle { background:#ffffff; }
td.diff-ntitle { background:#ffffff; }
td.diff-addedline {
    background:#ccffcc;
    font-size: smaller;
}

td.diff-deletedline {
    background:#ffffaa;
    font-size: smaller;
}

td.diff-context {
    background:#eeeeee;
    font-size: smaller;
}

span.diffchange { color: red; font-weight: bold; }

I noticed that when searching using the monobook theme, it uses the old
search, only the new theme uses the better search.  Not sure if that can be
fixed.

One forced refresh and I got them.

That is pretty tricky, given how the layout is done. Anyone want to 
attempt a patch to fix that prob?

Not sure you could call these technical but in no particular order...

Special:Popularpages disappeared early this year, can it be reinstated now
that performance issues are solved?

Is Codex staying with MediaWiki or moving to Blicki or another platform?

If staying with MediaWiki, upgrade to the latest version.

Add more extensions allowed for Uploads so things such as video tutorials
can be uploaded.

Regards.

I don't know why it's broken, so I'm not sure how to fix it, but I could 
give volunteers access to the Google analytics stats.

That's up to you guys.

> If staying with MediaWiki, upgrade to the latest version.

I tried when I did the migration, I was unable to upgrade to 1.6.8, 
which is the last version that supported PHP4. It bothers me that they 
made PHP5 a requirement, but I suppose we could get that installed and 
try it out again, but I'm not optimistic.

Which extensions, specifically? We'll have to watch it closely for abuse.

+1 for sticking with MediaWiki.

Find someone you trust to do the upgrade, and also ask them to manage future
upgrades.  Hopefully upgrading will solve the mysterious problems like
Popularpages just disappearing.  Wonder if RecentChanges only reporting so
many days is part of that?

The discussion page, http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex_talk:Screencasts
mentions SWF, GIF, and AVI as possibilites.

What is it about Mediawiki that you like?

I was looking over the new features in new versions of Mediawiki, I 
couldn't find anything that would be applicable to us.

Is there anything in particular you want in a newer version?

Nothing but the obvious.  Good collaboration tool.  History of edits. Free.
Wiki markup.  Talk Pages.  It's documented.  Lots of people know how to use
it.  It works.

Here's some 'wishes' I detailed when the blicki subject was broached in
February  http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MichaelH/Blicki_Features

Yet another mediawiki goofup?

I'd rather have it stay with mediawiki since a move will need a lot of
work, and will never really be complete. Making it a test case for
Blicki might not lead to high reliability :)

Nah, just stick to the one we have + security upgrades if any.

> Which extensions, specifically? We'll have to watch it closely for abuse.

I think it is about time to move to the next level in documentation. A
wiki can only do so much. We could use a documentation team (Elected
and/or selected) with regular meetings on IRC, a plan and a goal. The
end product should be an online book which has been reviewed by 'n'
editors, and organized according to a master plan. It should be easily
searchable/indexable.  Except for the last criterion, the docs at
http://help.ubuntu.com is an example that can be improved upon (look
for the "Community Docs" tab at the top right). Note that
http://help.ubuntu.com came from http://wiki.ubuntu.com for the most.

We have tried a flat-hierarchy and it hasn't worked, so let's try
organization (a democratic one if you will). If the effort does not
take off, then a system where users/organizations can put up bounties
for sections/chapters/divisions of documentation would be great too.
Heck, we could come out with an "Official" WordPress documentation
guide endorsed by the developers and documentors and use that money to
support infrastructure. More than the money, the book will help refine
the documentation and organize it.

I am sorry I have been busy with no end in sight for my Ph.D.  I was
really saddened when I read the news about Codex's "demise" and "end
of useful life" from a couple of sources :) It is not useless -
there's enough there to make something very useful out of it all.

Regards,
Carthik.

Hi,

I've set myself up as user Lambic on the Codex. I'm volunteering my
services to do a bit of editing and maybe expansion where necessary.

I've been using WordPress for a couple of years, I've written a plugin
for it and hacked about with some of the code on my blog. I have lots of
other software development experience.

More appropriate to the Codex effort, I'm a native English Speaker from
England (now in Canada) with above average spelling and grammar skills. 
I'm also a punctuation nazi.

I've already added a couple of entries to the Glossary, and fixed a
couple of typos I found. If there's anything more specific required,
just let me know.

Welcome!

We're in the middle of a bit of new direction for the Codex, which we're 
still figuring out.

What are your thoughts on the current organization of the documentation 
and how it could be improved?

I like the idea of starting with a book metaphor and expanding from
that. Defining a small set of "chapters" and an even smaller set of
"appendices" and assigning all content to one chapter or appendix.
Hyperlinking within the content will still let people jump around
wherever they want but there would be an underlying start to finish
organisation. Moving some of the more esoteric stuff to the appendices
might also make navigation of the core stuff clearer and easier.

An overall Table of Contents that lists all of the content would be a 
big help.  That would let people know "where they are" and to be fairly 
sure that they've seen all of the material on a particular topic.  (I 
wrote earlier that the links pointing to pages of other links confuse 
me.)  If it's possible to have chapter and section numbers (which would 
change as new material is added, of course), that might help more.

Since Codex is maintained by its readers, though, I wonder if the 
more-ordered book-like structure could eventually break down as people 
put new content wherever they think it should go.  If they don't have a 
good understanding of the whole structure, they might not put content in 
the best place.  (I don't have much experience with group-edited 
documentation, though.  Maybe this isn't a problem.)

Not being wiki savvy, I'm basically thinking out loud.  There's been much
discussion about having some Mod types that oversee the structure.  Wouldn't
it be possible to simply have new pages only saved as drafts, and then upon
approval, have them moved to the appropriate section as deemed by the
mod/admin team?  Editing existing pages wouldn't be effected.

And what are the possibilities of having a totally new structure built in an
offsite /sandbox type environment, culling current info and reorganizing?
Once that is done, migrate to the root of the codex install.  That would
allow for some logical organization, without completely confusing those
who've muddled their way through the codex and have a general idea of where
pertinent info is.

Let me say thanks in advance to those who are looking to take this on, and
by all means, feel free to use me as a liason to the forums community.  I
think a much more effective marriage could be found than in the past.

Michael

Traditional media has a ToC and an Index. The index would be more of a
site map, but I see the ToC looking something like this:

Chapter 1: Getting Started
Chapter 2: The Admin interface
Chapter 3: Customization / Themes
Chapter 4: Add-ons / Plugins
Chapter 5: Expansion
Chapter 6: Advanced Usage
Chapter 7: Writing your own themes / plugins

Appendix 1: Glossary
Appendix 2: Function / Coding Reference
Appendix 3: Miscellany
Appendix 4: Index

If something ends up in the wrong place, hopefully it will be spotted
and corrected fairly quickly.

Subject: [wp-docs] Firefox won't open FAQ link 
Message-ID: <457895AF.8020501@jpeek.com>

I hope this is the right place to report a bad link on wordpress.org.

 From the page http://wordpress.org/search/, I clicked on the 
"Frequently Asked Questions" link with Firefox 2.0 (Windows XP Pro).  A 
dialog box popped up:

"You have chosen to open FAQ, which is a: application/octet-stream from: 
http://codex.wordpress.org.  Would you like to save this file?"

There were two buttons: Save File and Cancel.  I actually was hoping to 
read the FAQ in my browser, but I chose "Save File".  When I opened the 
file with a file-viewer program, all the file said was:

     The FAQ is at: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_FAQ

I'm new to WordPress, but that site doesn't seem to cover "The most 
frequently asked questions at WordPress.org."  If the FAQ is sumewhere 
else, where?  No matter what: should someone fix that link?

Thanks,
Jerry

I expect it should link to here:

http://codex.wordpress.org/faq

Sadly wordpress.org/search sits outside the codex so I can't fix it.

If you go to this page: http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Advanced_Topics then
click on the Back to FAQ link you see the same problem.

Maybe something to do with the fact that the page name (FAQ) is in all
uppercase letters. Wonder if something changed with the settings in the
recent Codex move?

This works though:  http://codex.wordpress.org/Faq

I moved the link to http://codex.wordpress.org/faq . The other link  
will work in a whlie; it's fixed, but right now some fancy caching  
hasn't caught up with the change yet.

Ironically, in Ubuntu we're (slowly) moving in the opposite direction 
-- fewer book-style manuals and guides with chapters, and more 
individual pages on specific topics. 
<https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TopicBasedHelp> Similar will eventually happen 
for the Gnome system on which Ubuntu is based.

I don't think the two options are mutually exclusive. It's a good idea
to have small individual pages on individual topics, but those
individual pages should also be organised into some kind of book/chapter
format.

I find a lot of the codex pages too long and too wordy, but striking a
good balance between conciseness and good explanations is a tricky
balancing act and depends a lot on your target audience.

Subject: [wp-docs] Modify installation page to mention wordpress@example.com?
Message-ID: <18044.1166730664@chishio.swcp.com>

I'm doing my second WordPress installation.  I remember a surprise
after my first installation: that WordPress was sending emails from
the address wordpress@myhost.com.  But nothing I read had told me
about that address.  So any email sent to that address (say, a
bounced message) would go nowhere.  That doesn't seem like good
admin practice to me, and it also might lose useful info (that,
say, someone registered with a bogus email address).

I created a mail alias on my server to forward wordpress@myhost.com
to me.  I'm thinking that would be a good thing to add to the page
http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress .  But I thought
there might be a reason why this isn't mentioned -- even as an
"optional" step.  And I also wonder where to put this info in that
install doc: it doesn't seem to fit anywhere, so I'm thinking that
a new section would be the right place.  Finally: some users can't
set up arbitrary email addresses on their server, so maybe they'd
want to change the wordpress email address to something else (like
an account at Yahoo, their personal email address, etc.)

Comments?  Advice?  Thanks.

Why would anyone send something to that address in normal practice? You
think it might happen on a site with multiple loosely connected
contributors or something?

There are a variety of spam related reasons why using a different domain
might be a bad idea for sending these emails. Perhaps changing the
account, the part before the domain could be done. I'm not sure what the
implications of simply including a Reply-To header might be, but perhaps
that would be the best solution.

One reason is that there may be bounces coming back to wordpress@wherever
due to bad email addresses in messages that WordPress sends automatically.
The people administering WordPress should know that they've got a bad
email address in their system.  Also, there's a chance that someone will
write to this address looking for help or wanting to send a comment.

If the intention is to have no replies sent to this address, maybe it
should be changed to something like no-reply@wherever.

The Reply-To header sounds like a good idea.
