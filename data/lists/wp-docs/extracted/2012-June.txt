Message-ID: <4583C406-8B22-4E9A-A3C9-8FAF5E3BC1C3@gmail.com>

Hi All.

My codex searching skills are failing me, but is there a place that shows Site Admins (not Network Administrators) on a multi-site install how to delete their own sites (Tools->Delete Site)?  If not, is there a place I can write it up and put it?  It is such a small thing that I assume it can't be on its own.

Thanks!

Evan

I don't think it's it in there at all. Realistically, there probably should
be a whole user section. Not for users to follow, because that's confusing
enough, but something to show what users on *your* network can see (or not,
as the case may be).

For now, you can write stuff up under you own wiki user pages, while we
figure out where it should go. ;)

Ideas or feedback anyone?

A.

As the documentation is developing on WordPressMS, thanks you to you all,
indeed put the missing pieces under your own user pages in an article as
described in the guidelines on the Codex. I'm sure there are more missing
pieces, so add them to the http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/ task on the
article as you find them, just to keep a record of the pieces, and link to
the drafts you are developing on the Codex.

We really need more on the handling of Plugins on WPMS, too. I added some
material last year or so, but we need to make sure that Themes and Plugins
are explained thoroughly in the documentation as it can be really confusing
knowing which are for which sites and the limits.

Thanks!

Lorelle

Can't seem to find any specifics on the Codex for the WP_Theme API. Is
anyone working on that for the Codex yet?

Thanks,

I'll be putting together some posts on it in the next week or so, which can
form a basis for any documentation.

Sorry for the delay in responding. Fabulous. Let us know when it is ready
and we'll start attacking!

Thanks!
