I'd vote for no, just on the basis of the pay for affiliate links. Not something good for the codex. If they want to rewrite it for the codex, that would rock!

Otherwise, WPORG might be perceived as endorsing some of the commercial

We've had this come up many times. I've put a reply to him on the discussion
page. I think it represents our feelings. Please edit or add to the
discussion.

In general, we link to individual articles on sites that might be considered
commercial by the strictest sense as they host advertising or sponsored
content. Individual articles may be acceptable if they meet our case by case
requirements for "quality," integrity and durability, as well as appropriate
helpfulness. But we don't link to entire sites, not allow one site to have a
majority of links in the Codex. It's a pain to keep checking for dead links
so we choose carefully.

If my reply meets with approval, I'd like to consider it closed. In the
future, let's direct them to Code Poet and the profiles on WordPress.org so
they can reach out to the right audience through those venues.

Thanks!

Lorelle,
 
Ok that makes sense I think I got it.
 
 So you are saying that if I wrote my WordPress Quick Start Guide as a
single article (it would be quite long) that might be acceptable conditional
on quality standards and integrity?  
 
thanks
 
Marc

@Marc: Probably not. If you solved some great bit of code and published it,
offered in depth analysis on a subject beyond the basics covered in the
Codex, or offered a unique way of using WordPress, then it would be a
appropriate to link to that as a resource link at the bottom of a related
article.

Links to general articles that repeat a lot of what is already been offered
in the Codex, that's redundant and unnecessary. We'd have to watch all the
time to ensure that it was updated to the latest version and...trust me, we
have enough trouble keeping the Codex updated without worrying about
off-site content. :D It's more important we improve and keep up our own
documentation.

By standards and integrity, we mean in keeping with the WordPress Codex
policies, such as the use of the capital P in WordPress, guiding not
selling, etc. It's a bit subjective, as is appropriate, but the policies
have been honed well since 2004.

To be completely honest and to preserve this for posterity, here's where,
IMHO, your site fails:

1. The content is not freely accessible.
2. To access the content, the user must give away private and personal
information.
3. The purpose of the site is to sell WordPress tutorials and content, NOT
offer open and free content.
4. The author of the content and information about the people behind the
site is invisible or hard to find, thus lacks integrity and transparency.
Without qualifications, there is no verification that this isn't just
another "make money with WordPress" scam.
5. The site resembles the many that have come before, including the art
work. It really closely matches a site I railed against promoting "buying"
WordPress
http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/06/30/dont-buy-wordpress-its-free/

While you and your site's integrity might be unquestionable, you are asking
people experienced in spotting these and this is what we see. Trust me,
we've seen plenty.

Thank you again for your understanding in this. Again, I highly recommend
Code Poet and the WordPress profiles as a great way to help promote your
efforts for the WordPress community, though I would work harder to change
the site's look, feel and intentions to be more in keeping with the noted
WordPress experts we do support. We need all the help and support we can get
and it is much appreciated.

Thank you Lorelle that is very good feedback. 

I am not sure what is protocol here but I suggest we move this to the Talk
page:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Talk:WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#THank_you_Lorell
e_that_was_very_good_feedback

But am sending one last email to the list as follows:

Thanks Lorelle that was great. I can work with all that, such as the optin
requirement, let me reflect.  

Since you are so frank with me allow me to reciprocate.  One difficulty of
the Codex system of maintaining documentation is that authors come and go
and they are quite busy under the best of circumstances.  Your current
documentation hasn't changed much in 3 years and it's really extremely brief
and lacking guided tutorials and screen shots, quite aside from the
neutrality requirements that are something of a necessary evil (they make
the job of providing practical information more difficult).  (As an aside I
noticed a Bluehost hosting link in the Guide).  I spend a large chunk of my
time writing WordPress documentation and researching / reviewing commercial
WordPress products.  I am seeking a way to contribute this work to the Codex
in some fashion, and I am unable to see clearly right now what that would
be, but the benefits seem compelling to all.  In any case I appreciate the
feedback and will continue to reflect

Also in the spirit of honest disclosure, my interest in Code Poet etc would
be stronger if my primary goal was to promote my services.  I already run
large sold-out webinars through affiliates and finding students is not an
issue. Of course promoting my services is part of my objective but I am also
a writer by trade and I take pleasure in my craft for its own sake.  I hope
that makes sense.  

Cheers,

Marc

Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress Flossmanuals Book Jog
Message-ID: <4E4A3B06.2050705@riseup.net>

Hi there,

If any of you people are up for this please read on or contact me on
this email address, or via discussion on this list.
Nice one, Mick

--WordPress Flossmanuals Book Jog--

Invite also here - http://blog.booki.cc/
We're off to a bit of a slow start, but the Book Jog us underway -
Please do spread the word!
There is a chapter framework in place and a welcome message for those
that call in.

--Invite to WordPress Book Jog

We invite you to join us on a book jog to update the WordPress manual
hosted on Floss Manuals ? The existing one is here ?
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/

What is a Book Jog? It builds on the concept of Book Sprint but
downgrades the concept somewhat (sorry about that). While a book sprint
normally has a real life meet up at its core and has a solid time frame
of anything from 2-5 days typically, a book jog takes place over a
longer time frame and may not have a real life meeting at its core.
For this manual there is no real meet up, we are all geographically
disparate. We aim to complete it in 10 days from the 12th August - 5th
September 2011

We want to build on the great documentation that already exists about
WordPress to create a manual on Floss Manuals for the following reasons:
Creating a concise introduction to WordPress

Some might say that there is already too much existing documentation on
WordPress, in numerous locations. This manual will be a digest of the
most vital aspects of WordPress for those creating a WordPress site. We
feel that there is definitely a place for specialized manuals. This
manual is aimed at audiences who are;

    * new to using WordPress
    * want to improve the look of their blog and learn more about design
in WordPresss
    * wish to extend WordPress to make it the basis for an online community

--Using an Open and Flexible Documentation Platform

Unlike many manuals, Flossmanuals are written with a totally open,
do-what-you-want-to-it license. This gives writers the freedom to
improve and update the manuals as new software versions are released.
Manuals are written collaboratively inviting alterations and
improvements from readers and users. The most up-to date-version of the
manual is available in several formats, including printed book, epub,
html, and open office.

Working towards a book is a great focus for a documentation project.

--Helping to foster Independent Online Communities

We want to share our enthusiasm for WordPress as a great tool for
sharing information, publishing all kinds of media and helping to build
non-corporate online communities.

We believe that good training and follow up support is key to maximizing
the involvement of people in on-line communities. With the ability to
output the manual as a word document anyone can print various chapters
off as supporting handouts. You can also direct your site users to
specific chapters of the book online, where they will learn the tools,
and perhaps encourage others.

--Promoting the Open Web

Flossmanuals has a track record of supporting projects which embrace
collaboration and the open web. We think that the web is best when it is
open source and using open standards and decentralised. We believe that
independently hosted websites and communities a key part of keeping the
web open. The WordPress system is perfectly suited to this because it is
intuitive to use, easy to install and keep updated and is free software.

For more information on these aspects see the following book ? An Open Web
http://en.flossmanuals.net/an-open-web/


--Supporting this manual

In the past this manuals been used and supported by the following groups
and organisations, tactical tech, transmission video network, people?s
voice media, aktivix and hacktionlab. They have supported the manual by
contributing and some by paying for transport and documentation meetings.

You can support this version of the manual by giving your time to help
us write it, check it, and promote it.

You can do this by joining us in irc ? #booksprint of #flossmanuals in
irc.freenode.net, saying hi, and seeing what you can do to help.

To contribute directly you can go here -
http://booki.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/_edit/ ? You will need to log in
or create an account.
There is a draft chapter framework in place and a welcome message for
those that call in.

See you there!

I would guess no, because the GPL isn't suitable for documentation for
various reasons.

However, I do not know for sure what license it is available under.

Historically we've said Codex + WP.org documentation is available under 
GPL even though it's not well-suited for content because the GFDL is 
incompatible with the GPL, so for embedding documentation in code and 
such it's easier for them just to be "the same thing."

As for Learn, it's a WP.com-specific thing but the content and images 
are available under GPL or whatever license you guys would like if you'd 
like to adapt it for .org, it's meant to be shared. :)

What about a creative commons license for the docs?

Some people may be shying away from using it without any posted license is

Like I said happy to put whatever you like on there, let's just figure 
out a use-case and then we can pick the best license for it. :)

No reason it can't be available under multiple licenses. This can 
sometimes make porting it easier, as you begin to eliminate problems of 
license incompatibilities. It's just a matter of the copyright holder 
declaring it so.

There is also GFDL 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License and think 
some manuals are also available under LGPL 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License as it's 
less restrictive than the GPL for commercial use.

Hi folk

The main page was significantly altered a few weeks ago, and split into 
two broad sections.

I'm a little concerned about the wording of the section heading 
"WordPress for non-developers".  Specifically, I dislike the term 
"non-developers".  I think it's a bit too negative, and has tones to it 
that we could avoid.

I've nothing against the front page re-design per se, but I'd love to 
remove this "non-developer" term.  I was thinking "WordPress for 
blogers" would be better, but I'm conscious that there's been an effort 
in the community to pull away from the "blog" term.

Does anyone have a better term to use? "end users" doesn't quite fit, 
either, I don't think.

How about Administrators and Developers?

End user is more like your readers at this point.

Developer writes themes/plugins
Admins administer and moderate (and post)
Writers write.

I agree. I'm not happy with the wordy front page, a look and feel that I
feel adds more confusion than less.

I'm also concerned as I don't recognize the person who edited all these
changes. The front page of the Codex should have been locked down for
editing only by those with the highest levels of administration as it has a
long history of spam. It was locked down.

Such a change without discussion here is not a good idea, so let's start the
discussion to really fix this.

Thanks,

Lorelle

Protections may have been removed a while back when the codex went
wacky. I reprotected it. If it needs to be reverted or unprotected let
me know.

Thanks, Otto. Which brings up the decision to leave it as it is and fix it
or put it back to what it was.

Has anyone talked to Spencer who made the edits? Is he on the mailing list?
(Wishing for our own P2 still. :D )

I just tried to access mailing list archives and can't get to
http://lists.automattic.com/ in Chrome, tho it could be me as Firefox was
fine.

Anyway - I had been thinking about a multisite section on the front page as
well. Just to toss that out there.

Now that I'm not on my cell phone

If anything, the layout is ? terrible.  It's too much information, not laid out in any helpful way.  As with WikiPedia, most users start in the middle of the Codex.  A search for 'WordPress how do I make a theme' comes up with http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development first, which is as it should be ;)  A Wiki's not a book (says my mentor over and over again).

We should revert to what we had and THEN go forward and rebuild it. Except that I went back to the Before shot and it was this: http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Main_Page&oldid=108003

That too is way too much information and not enough organization.  If it's more than a couple scrolls, no one's going to read it.  I'd break it out so 'Getting Started' is the brunt of the page.  We have a lot of links going to subsections of pages, which either means each link should be a page of it's own, or we trust they're going to read.  The amount of duplicated information is adding to the length, and it's almost overwhelming for me, and I know what I'm doing most of the time ;) (And I lie well the rest of the time!)

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Ipstenu/Main_Page

After I yanked out all the dupe info, there was a lot less going on.  I left off the "Developer" stuff, as that really should be it's own page. Actually, most of that stuff should go on the FAQ pages, where a cursory skim shows most of the info, with links, actually is already.

I am agreeing with the idea of reverting it back and having a solid
discussion on what needs to be there.

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Front_Page_Project

I've started a user page for us to work on this together. For many years,
I've wanted a simple, clean "What do you want to do with WordPress?" feel,
much like the Windows ad campaign years ago. We need to funnel people to the
areas of the Codex where they can find the help they need, so let's make it
really easy.

I've been working on the answer to that question over the years and it boils
down to those few answers. Take a look and see what you think. Do you feel
the same way? Then let's start looking at how we can group the subcontent
together to keep this clean and simple.

Thanks!

Lorelle

Thanks to all for the discussion.  i appreciate that 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Ws5f3dj7 put some effort into 
re-arranging the page, which is why I didn't jump in and revert at the 
time, but it does look as though the consensus here is that this 
particular layout doesn't quite work.  It's a shame he's not on this 
list. Perhaps we should prod him on-wiki?

I've taken a look at the proposed page design from Lorelle, and I think 
I'd be much happier with that style, it seems more dynamic and 
accessible.  We should put some thought into what those links should be 
in the categories.

Are we going for a revert to 
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Main_Page&oldid=108003 in the 
mean time?

As a relatively new WordPress user, I find Lorelle's proposed layout refreshing. It's easy to get lost in too many choices - this breaks things down into manageable decision paths.

Like the layout your suggesting Lorelle.

It's clear, clean and easy to understand. Very understandable headings.

I think one of the more difficult parts will be how many links there 
will be under each heading, and where they will direct to.

So far, so good though.

My main concern with one big 'list' is that it gets really long.   
tl;dr exists for a reason.  If we're only talking about 4-5 links per  
section, splitting them into two columns is easier for people to read.  
  Your monitor may be 22" but your eyes remain a fixed distance apart.  
;)

I made a v2 of Lorelle's layout, tossing in links that were pretty  
much what you find doing a search for those terms in Google.  Then I  
put a 'header' with quick links and a short intro.

As you approach 1000px, the human eye's ability to follow horizontal 
lines (eg text) starts to degrade significantly. We could also keep in 
mind the 'F' eye scan pattern - which means that anything on the left 
side will have more prominence than centre or left.

Much easier to scan - which is what virtually every visitor will do as 
opposed to actually reading. All the real user stuff is on the left too 
- which should help.

A little concerned that the links at the very top are going to get 
missed because of the text on the left. Would it be worth bringing them 
down below the text and ordering left-to-right in order of potential 
usefulness?

Re layout: http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Esmi/Main_Page

1. The links at the top of the page I find confusing. Mainly because 
everything is under headings, there is no definition of what I am 
looking at, and it could be confused with a table of contents.

2. Under "Give Back" it says 'Volunteers Needed for Codex Documentation 
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Contributing>' & 'WordPress 
Documentation Team'.
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Documentation_team>Which is more or less the 
same. I would keep one.

3. The same goes for the heading "Customize or create a theme". There is 
overlap in the links below it.  I'm not sure how I would improve the 
links titles, but maybe merge 'Theme Development' & 'Blog Design & 
layout'. Also having 'FAQ Layout and Design 
<http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Layout_and_Design>' might leave people 
wondering why there is no FAQ on the other topics.

4.  On "Contribute to Development" there is 'contributing to WordPress'. 
When I read contribute to development I read code. There are many ways 
people can contribute. Maybe something like: Contribute to coding, 
contribute finanically, etc. Would help people get a sense of how they 
can help at first glance, this might improve contribution.

5. I'm not sure if I am keen on having the headings in columns next to 
each other. I would maybe have headings all below, and place links in 
columns if needed. The first time I saw the layout, it worked confusing, 
the second time I was used to it.

Thank you, Michael, for switching. However, I agree with most of what is
said. I didn't think we'd be making the switch of the front page so fast, so
I've jumped in and tightened up a few things.

It isn't perfect, so what is missing that is CRITICAL? Then let's focus on
how to make this even better OFF the main site. :D

I just love working with such brilliance!

On the mention of FAQs, there's usually one for each 'section.' Ought we put that as the last link per?

And if there isn't one, we may want to make one.

The problem with the FAQs are that they are improved from what they once
where, but they are still more confusing and in depth than they need to be.
If we can clean up the FAQs to be more specific, removing old references no
longer needed and pointing towards toc pages to stay more relevant, then I
have no problem adding them.

Anyone up for checking out the FAQs and giving us a clean TOC for them?

And the questions keep changing ;) FAQs are hard.  Then for now, we should remove them until we can clean 'em up.

Less confusion for the reader.

I'm in agreement with that. Removing the one FAQ off the front page.

Okay, folks, this is wonderful. I'm going to copy over what I did on the
front page to my test page. Let's do the rest of the tweaking there before
we touch the front page of the site again. Let's see what this gets us as a
test. Tell your friends, neighbors, and social network folks to check it out
and report in.

I've summarized what happened today in the Discussion page of the test front
page draft http://codex.wordpress.org/User_talk:Lorelle/Front_Page_Project

In it, I've included some things we need to do and think about.

Take a look at the new front page and have your say here or on the
discussion page.

Again, great work all!

Spencer Hill, the person who made the recent major changes on the front
page, has been trying to get on this list and be heard. He just emailed me
directly. Otto, can you check to ensure the docs mailing list auto functions
are still working. The confirmation might not have gone out or something.
Thanks.

I've thanked him for alerting us to the need to secure the front page and
for kicking us to get something done with it. I look forward to his, and
your, feedback on the Discussion page on the Codex for the new front page
project and your help to improve it even more.

Thanks!

Lorelle

I don't have direct access to the listserv, since it's on Automattic's
servers. Some of those have moved off there, but not all of them yet.

However, there seems to be some kind of referrer issue going on. If
you go here: http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo then click
the wp-docs link, it works. If you directly, you get a forbidden.

In theory emailing wp-docs-owner at lists.automattic.com should hit up whomever is the admin.

Also the URL works if you put a / at the end, I've found.

Hey everyone. This is Spencer Hill, the person who made the edits to the front page.

I apologize for the late introduction and for any inconveniences I may have caused. Thanks to mrmist I realized my post on the "Discussions" section of the "Main Page" wasn't the correct place to hold discussions... about the main page. Heh.

I've had the opportunity, now, to read through all of the threads and, if my opinion is valued here, I agree with most of the feedback. Before I note anything else though I thought I would include the note I put on the discussion for the main page as I assume only mrmist was able to review it before the constructive criticism of the changes:

"I've spent several hours today revising the Main Page and a few of a subsequent pages and I wanted to make some notes, comments and requests to the community.

First, I've reorganized the Main Page to include descriptions for each section. This will allow future users and contributors greater ease while navigating this codex.

Secondly, there are many similar articles and landing pages throughout the codex that leave users and contributors confused or following links in circles and down rabbit holes. I want to encourage and plead with fellow contributors to focus on condensing and organizing all subsequent landing pages and articles according to the Main Page. That way we don't have three "Getting Started" sections and information that's geared towards developers mixed with information that's geared towards absolute beginners who have no interest in programming WordPress.

Lastly, I'd like to suggest the following structure improvements for the codex:

Main Page displays a title and description, as well as a few popular quick links to all of the primary areas of the codex. By selecting section title, the user should be redirected to a dedicated page for that section. This will help prevent the Main Page from becoming a confusing conglomerate of links.
Each section's dedicated landing page should include a more thorough description and a list of links beneath each of the following section titles "Resources", "FAQ", "Popular Topics" and "Training & Documentation". These sections should not cross pollinate by sharing links among each other.
For example: If a link to a PAGE under FAQ happens to contain information that is related to some of the other sections, fine, users can certainly include links to these others sections when it's within content on a page. But users shouldn't put these links in the links list beneath each of those sections.
Well, those are my thoughts. Hopefully they all make sense and are on the same track as the rest of the community. Though I suppose some may object, but let's get the conversation rolling. I've got clients who want to learn how to use WordPress and I'm tired of rewriting training materials and reshooting screen casts for every client! ;)"

Now that I know the proper place to hold discussions about changes to the wiki you guys can count on me sharing ideas and joining the discussion here before making any serious changes to the front page.

That being said, I hope you guys weren't too rattled by my changes but rather that it sparked an important conversation so developers and non-developers alike can find the codex useful and helpful.

One last note, regardless of the content or structure of ESMI's layout, it's lacking clarity for people who are not developers. We have to provide a safe location for people who don't know, understand or care about WordPress' functions, installation, etc... to get their information without being slammed with loads of technical terms, FAQ's and links.

There's only so much you can do to make certain things "simple enough".

My concern with your changes was how MUCH data we had up there. People don't read.  They just don't, not for WordPress, and not for their jobs (if I go postal, it will probably be over people telling me that they didn't read the documentation because at 6 short sentences, it was too long).  Even right now, we do have too much going on.

So in my eyes, the question we need to answer is: Why do people go to the FRONT page of the codex?

I would say it's because they've heard about WP and they either want to see what sort of documentation there is at all before installing, or they have their first question about it.  So the first section should be how to install, how to add themes/plugins, how to get help.

Next we have the 'how do I use this?' set.  So we need a section on how to make posts and pages and links.  Also how to use widgets in themes.  In fact, something for a basic "this is how a theme works, this is how you can edit it." WITHOUT touching any code.

Finally you have the creationists (not those, the ones who wanna write stuff).

People who make plugins and themes already know how to Google.  People who want to learn to do that, though, should have a quick "this is how you make A theme. This is a child theme." and a plugin one.

But after that, we're getting into heavy lifting, and there's really not a perfect way to avoid learning code and how to read technical docs to learn things. We shouldn't lower the bar, but we should build some stepladders so they can climb up and join us :)

Do you honestly think that these people will bother to read lots of 
text? The forums are full of people who are in far too much of a rush to 
read. They want to click through to an answer as fast as possible. The 
less text and the more potentially useful-looking links the page can 
offer, the better it is likely to perform, in my opinion.

There's very little jargon above the fold on the current page.

What's striking me is that we also could use a separate Table of Contents page for the whole Codex, for intermediate to advanced users, including developers, to bookmark. They (we) also use the Codex as well as Google.

The sidebar has categories like Advanced Topics but one has to click through many times and noodle around to find out what is where. I'd thinking more of a comprehensive page that one can skim or grok to get some precision on where to click.

How would we define what is and isn't intermediate? I'm not being facetious!  I still think of FTP (or some file management tool) as being a bog standard "you need to know this to run your own website." but as I'm sure Esmi will back me up, the number of people who blanch when you tell them to FTP in and rename the plugins folder is not insignificant :/

We don't have to pinpoint exactly what is intermediate versus what we advanced. What I'm suggesting is one comprehensive TOC page (for topics which could be either, or even basic) that non-beginners could use to drill down. We can, and I think should, have such a page in a prominent location which just doesn't happen to be the main page.

The problem with a comprehensive TOC is that it would be too 
overwhelming - especially for non-technical users.

I  can see merit in the idea.

A comprehensive TOC is definitely needed, but again - not necessarily on the
front page.

I think that's the whole idea: that a comprehensive TOC be available, but
*not* on the Front Page. :)

Perhaps think of it more as a "sitemap"?

I think that this is a valid comment. I went to the Manchester (uk)
Wordpress User's Group meeting and they really got the idea of the
Wordpress manual that we are working on
(http://blog.booki.cc/2011/08/wordpress-flossmanuals-book-jog/) as a
bridge / ladder to the excellent stuff already there.

I think the discussions about how to get that beginner, user,
administrator content easily found on codex is really exciting to see.
It took me 4 clicks from the codex front page to get to here
http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started

My thoughts are that a wiki _can_ be a book (if you want it to be), and
sometimes books are useful for people that want to follow a thread, to
be guided to learn something. Also books provide a great source of
structured handouts for training (that's what I do for cash).

I'm sure that there is a space for this kind of thing on the
wordpress.org without drawing attention from the essential stuff already
there - I wonder if it is a separate space from the codex or if it can
be well integrated.

It's great that learn.wordpress.com can be gpl-ed for the codex -
there's some great stuff there.

We also use GPL at flossmanuals for the docs there to, so anything that
gets written there can be synched into the hopefully growing pages for
beginners / intermediates to create that ladder.

The book jog is plodding on - there's a lot of content now - here's
today's snap shot.
http://objavi.booki.cc/books/wordpress-en-2011.08.27-16.24.09.pdf

Please do feel free to register and get editing. There information how
http://blog.booki.cc/2011/08/wordpress-flossmanuals-book-jog/

I'd welcome any other suggestions for how this effort could sync well
with the codex or any other docs that are out there.

nice one,
mick

Excellent discussion all. Here's some experiential history to consider.

WordPress Levels have been set to be:

   1. Beginners/New to WordPress: Installation (if necessary), setup, terms,
   posts, Pages, finding and switching Themes, links and images and video
   (content stuff).
   2. Plugin Writing: For those into the technical side of developing
   Plugins from simple to sophisticated.
   3. Theme Development: For all the web designers of the world embracing
   WordPress.
   4. Developers: Coders, hackers, core developers, customizers, delving
   deep into the engine that runs WordPress.
   5. Contribution: Documentation to support those who want to give back
   through docs, forums, Plugins, Themes, WordCamps, devs (an area we
   definitely need more documentation on).


We've found that terms like intermediate and advanced don't work. We tried.
They are vague and don't apply specifically to the areas that people are
really interested in.

The most successful TOC structure we've found is to give key links to "sub"
table of content pages so people can drill down to their specific needs.
We've tried most popular links, a site map structure, and a variety of ways
to speed up clicks from the front to the answer in the past 8 years. The
current structure of sub TOC pages for drill down works as many people
really don't know what they are looking for. This method leads them down the
right path with a familiar "book" format.

This has been especially true since the search functionality on the Codex
has always sucked and now is worse since changes in structure in the past
year turns up EVERYTHING WordPress.org when you think you are searching only
in the Codex. We need to get that fixed and restrict documentation searches
to documentation with an option to expand into Plugins, Themes, and Forum
results. It's taking me longer than ever to get right to the page I need as
Codex pages are way down on the results and I "know" exactly the same of the
page.

A lot of the help in creating the structure of the front page came from
WordCamps. As they grew, they developed tracks, funneling participants to
areas of most interest to them. As a frequent attendee to WordCamps
worldwide, I realized the natural pattern their program tracks created and
used that for structuring the new look for the front page. It's like the
architect who left landscaping for a year or two after the building was
built. The natural path of people to and from the building became the
sidewalks rather than forcing people to cut across the grass.

As for the Book Jog, there is the WordPress Handbook which will link
directly with the WordPress core and is divided up into similar breakdowns
as above. It already has documentation based upon the Codex and will become
the key "manual" for WordPress. The Codex will continue to exist as a more
in depth support documentation service, digging deeper into subjects beyond
the Handbook and offering topics it doesn't cover. I don't see the docs team
splitting their energies away from support for the Codex and Handbook as
there is so much work to do here, do you?

The search doesn't have to be a hard fix. 

MediaWiki, even the aged version we're running, has a decent search in and of itself -  http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Search is the stand alone page.

If possible, we could change the theme to actually use the codex's built in search.  The code is, I believe, just a call to the search box (I'm running the latest and greatest version and it changed around 1.16?). Of course, if the header the same file for the whole site and not just a duplicated theme, it gets messier.  But yeah, the search is buggered for the whole site.

Basically he posted, asked for ALL his posts to have his URLs removed.  I looked at the sheer number and said no.

Sam B said no.

Andrea said no.

Now it gets better because after the initial "no" he CONTINUED to post more with his URL and then ask to have them removed.  I tagged him 'bozo' for now.

Sorry to chime in late here, my message didn't get posted for some reason. This was written a few days ago in reply to Mika's response on the 26th:

I agree that there was too much data there. In my defense, I only added the first paragraph and the "For Non-Developers", anything after that was already there.

While simplicity is key, the purpose of the codex is to inform visitors. So wouldn't it be a mistake to omit critical information simply because we don't think people will read it? Or because it's not aesthetically pleasing? What if we set our goal on being clearly and concisely organized rather than being "simple'? That way we understand that we're only omitting information on a particular page if it's not relevant, premature or repetitive?

With regards to "Installation" being the first topic to address, it brings us back to the current problem with the existing and previous layouts: we're alienating end users who just want to learn how to use WordPress.

Does anyone object to having at least two different sections on the front page so as to respect the two critically different types of users we have (developers and non-developers)?

The 'too much data' wasn't just towards you :) Not intended to be that  
way, sorry if it was.

I agree, the purpose is to inform (teach) people, but we have to find  
a balance between teaching and overwhelming.  Their brains will get  
full (Farside joke).

Why don't we start with the links under "Learn How to Use WordPress"

Getting Started with WordPress is listed twice, we can obviously remove one.

WordPress.tv and WordPress Lessons are for external sites - Should  
they be listed on the front page of the codex at all?  Should we have  
a separate section for 'useful external but still related sites'?

I see your perspective with developers/non-developers compared to task based, and I think I agree, along with the others, now.

Does anyone have an example of a task based version? Here's a mockup I came up with:
Introduction to WordPress - This could be general information about what WordPress is and who uses it written in such a way that programmers, advanced users and folks who think you can "download the internet" can understand the first time through.
Installing WordPress
Using WordPress - This could be introductions to each section (Dashboard, Posts, etc...) including written step by step instructions with supporting screenshots and training videos.
Developing With WordPress - This could be where programmers and advanced users can come to read about code, server side and other highly technical topics.
FAQ - For the sake of organization and clarity; should we have a single FAQ page that breaks down into sub-FAQ's for each section?
I took screenshots today of each major section in WordPress and uploaded them to the file list for use in the Codex. And I'm working on screen casts as well. Though can anyone tell me how we should be linking users to videos? Just a YouTube embed or should they go into the File List repository?

I think a task-based for beginners, editors and administrators is a good
description of scope of the Wordpress manual we are working on here.

Lorelle, ideally the Book Jog content add into the Codex rather than
create more work. I can see that you guys clearly do loads of great

m3shrom, can you explain what the flossmanuals is? And what the booki links are? Maybe I'm just a newby, but I don't know what you're talking about there.

One thing I thought I would add to my previous comment; Phrases like "Enter the username and password WordPress emailed to you when you installed the site" isn't relevant and would be a little confusing to users who hired a developer to install the site for them. This is why I suggested, originally, that we have a separate section for (what I called) non-developers. If we move forward with the task based approach, how can we ensure there isn't confusion like this?

@m3shrom: We don't link nor promote sites violating the WordPress Trademark.
Just a reminder. They cannot use "wordpress" in their domain name. If you
know the owners of the site, you might want to warn them and recommend they
change their domain name accordingly. And in accordance with WordPress
Trademark, the P is always capitalized.

@everyone else: Installation is no longer considered a key big topic area.
Special installations are covered by developer topics.

FAQs, as previously mentioned, aren't helpful nor well organized and
updated, though they are much improved from the various past versions.
Unless there is a way to really clean those up and make them easier to use,
they are not high on the list.

I'm on my way to a meeting, but there should be instructions on the Codex
for adding Video. We've talked about this for ages, but we have to be very
careful that they do not promote any site or person, which is why we
recommend that they be on WordPress.tv first and then we link from there.
Can someone check the past chats about video if there isn't a site for
contributing video links on the Codex. Thanks!

Loreklle

I think that's a good question. If you are aiming to have step by step
instructions getting this kind of clarity can be tricky.

Personally, I've struggled in working on docs which are targeted at
people using
- their own install
- Wordpress.com
- a blog on a hosted WordPress network

For Codex / Manual docs it should be easier, you just need to add in
different possibilities for users with different levels of access. For
the example you use it could be...

"The first thing you need to log in is a Username and Password. If you
set up your own WordPress site then you should have them to hand. If
someone else set up the site, they may have added you as a user and
notified you in an automatically generated email. It should have the
title Your Username and Password."

@Lorelle - I don't know that guy / site. I just forwarded it for info. I
think that this is a very interesting comparing different kinds of docs,
when it comes to user focused, task based guides, it seems like often
the key skill is not completeness, it's the opposite, knowing what to
leave out.

That's guys guide was only 28 pages long including screenshots, which
gives a quick look at what he thought was most useful.

I would not be keen on having that specific documentation int he codex
itself becasue

a) we'd be supporting other people user's
b) wordpress.com already has the same docs, free to use
c) I'd argue the codex is not the place for it.

I guess I didn't really communicate clearly here. I'm responding to
Spencer's request.

> Does anyone have an example of a task based version?

I'm not suggesting importing these docs wholesale into the Codex. It's
more in the spirit of sharing different examples and approaches for
inspiration. Although, do feel free to copy and adapt anything suitable
from the Flossmanuals manual, as it is GPL, and as a community, we would
encourage this kind of re-purposing.

Andrea, I would like to hear your argument for not including training materials in the codex. At first, training materials did seem a bit abstract to me in the codex (because I primarily use it for researching functions), but there is definitely training materials pre-existing in it to date, and obviously there does need to be a location for training materials. But if you and others think we could separate training from the whatever would be in the codex I could see that being a potential solution to this question.

m3shroom, thanks for the example - that makes sense to me!

I was referring specifically to training material for users hosted on
someone else's network installation. Whomever hosted the person needs to
support them - not the codex.

I'm perfectly fine with a section explaining, for example "here's what users
in a network experience". that's quite different, as someone setting up a
network of sites can offer a multitude of plugins & themes for their users,
each different from the next host.

Think of it this way - if that same user, hosted on Joe's multisite network,
is paying Joe to host him, if they show up in the wp.org forums looking for
help, not only is there nothing I can do to help him, I have no idea what
options he has available.

And if it were me in change of a network, and my users were showing up in
the wp.org forums looking for help? Yes, I'd want them pointed back to me.

You can use wordpress.com as an example there too - while it's mentioned in
the codex, the codex is not the place for support docs for those users. The
codex is for documentation for people *running* the network.

I'm moving the conversation about including videos in the codex (for training and reference) into a new topic from "The main page." discussion.

Lorelle and I are wondering the most appropriate way to publish videos to the codex to assist users who have questions and such. Lorelle specifically suggested WordPress.tv but as someone who's new to WordPress.tv I'm not clear what it is, since there doesn't appear to be a way to register for an account or upload videos?

It sounds like Andrea's saying we should focus on 'How WordPress.org installs work' rather than 'How WordPress.com works.'

Yes, there's a tonne of crossover, and there are some .com docs we could lift wholesale and be happy about, but there's a lot that you CANNOT do on .com (install a plugin) and vice versa (there are some admin screens that are surprising the first time you see them).

A doc on 'So you've come here from .com?' would be sensible.

A how to use .com would not be.

This goes the same for people on Page.ly, which IIRC provides a limited MultiSite install for people to use.  We can't really help them, though some of the docs will be of interest. They're not the target.  The target is people who are installing (via one click or whatever) WordPress.org software on a server.

I'm not opposed to 'how to' docs in general, though the codex has been a documentation repository, and if we were to change it to a tutorial site, that's okay, but we have to manage to support BOTH tracks at that, and I'm not sure we're supporting one, to be honest.  We have to be cautious going down the tutorial slope, and there's already http://learn.wordpress.com/ - Maybe a learn.wordpress.org would be better served as a separate site. Leave the codex for pure documentation, with in-line examples.

At first, training materials did seem a bit abstract to me in the codex (because I primarily use it for researching functions), but there is definitely training materials pre-existing in it to date, and obviously there does need to be a location for training materials. But if you and others think we could separate training from the whatever would be in the codex I could see that being a potential solution to this question.

How to use .com does not belong in the .org Codex. It is a proprietary 
hosted site, and has its own documentation by its own paid staff. At 
most something lumped in with how to use the importers on how to import 
from .com would be okay.

Page.ly does individual installs and you can run any theme or plugin, afaik.

We have to be cautious going down the tutorial slope, and there's already http://learn.wordpress.com/ - Maybe a learn.wordpress.org would be better served as a separate site. Leave the codex for pure documentation, with in-line examples.
The intention for learn.wordpress.org is for tutorials and self-guided 
online courses/projects to teach how to use stuff. GSoC just ended and 
we'll be integrating the Courseware plugin that got worked on by Stas 
Suscov (intended for learn.wordpress.org) as soon as we get some UI 
worked out. Will be putting call out for content creators for this once 
the infrastructure is settled. After profiles, before 3.3 comes out.

Message-ID: <CAFVN-HSOOJ+sHJYnOsaOCzH92=WXJdpJc+W8fqy-E6ndRzcU0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,
I recently dove into trying to utilize WordPress's rewrite engine and how to
add content to the .htaccess file indirectly.
I discovered the first part wasn't too complicated once I read over a few
tutorials, but modifying/adding to the .htaccess file was a whole different
story.

So I decided to take a few hours and write some (hopefully helpful)
information to help others,
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Amereservant/Editing_and_Customizing_htaccess_Indirectly

I'm sure there's things I've missed or perhaps some of you have more
advanced knowledge of the topic and can refine the information to be more
useful.

Either way, I'd love to hear feedback on it and what you think.

Thanks,


David

You missed a rather simple trick that not many people know about. This
will add a rule to the .htaccess file when the rules are hard flushed.

add_rewrite_rule('myrule', '/newlocation');

In WordPress, all "internal" rewrite rules must start with "index.php"
for them to work properly. Any rule that doesn't start with index.php
gets shoved out into the .htaccess file as a normal RewriteRule when
the flush happens (basically when you visit the Settings->Permalink
page).

So you can use normal add_rewrite_rule calls to add normal .htaccess
rules as well as the internal kind.

Note: Internal rules use the $matches[1] method for referencing
pattern matchers. This won't work in .htaccess rules, you have to use
the $1 method for those rules.

BTW, you did get very close to this there at the end. What you missed
was that the add_rewrite_rule function (not the class function, but
the normal one), makes the resulting call to add_rule in the class.
This then does the index.php based determination, and adds the rule to
the $non_wp_rules there.

No need for an action on generate_rewrite_rules. That's the hard way
to do it. Put your action on init, then just call the add_rewrite_rule
function normally.

Hey Otto,
Thank you very much!  I'll update the document to reflect that.  Like I
mentioned before, it's odd how obscure information on adding .htaccess
content indirectly is and that's why I took a few hours to write that.

I really appreciate your help and everything else you've contributed to the
WordPress community.  I've come across at least a handful of your tutorials
that have been priceless in helping me learn how to develop themes and
plugins *correctly* for WordPress.  That takes a lot of time to do that and
I appreciate it.

Nicely done :)

I'm not sure where, but a caveat of 'Put your rules ABOVE WPs' might  
not be a bad idea.  That way you only have to run through the WP  
processing once and put a little less load on your box.

Cookies and cake for David!

Great article and it looks like you are getting fantastic help. However, I'm
not sure I like the title. Can we come up with something more helpful or is
that really the thing that people will look for when they search for this
help?

Thanks!

Someone with ssh access would have to run the following scripts:

Go to the maintenance folder and run

$ php purgeoldtext.php

(see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:PurgeOldText.php That will delete
all revisions for all deleted pages.)

Then you'd probably want to run either rebuildall.php or
rebuildrecentchanges.php.
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Rebuildall.php is documented but the
other's pretty obvious.

Thanks!

de is one place where you can send new WordPress users to use their new Wor=
dPress site. Essentially, something as user friendly as Learn WordPress (<a=
 href=3D"https://learn.wordpress.com/" target=3D"_blank">https://learn.word=
press.com/</a>) but targeted at people using self-hosted blogs.<br>


<br>
So all the information is already on the codex but as I see it the challeng=
e is to;<br>
<br>
* cut this information down to say something about the same length as Learn=
 WordPress<br>
* add screenshots to make it more user friendly<br>
* create a linear format that new user can work through<br>
* self contained, so that it can be used as a base for other guides<br>
<br>
The closest page I could come to that was this one.<br>
<a href=3D"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide" target=
=3D"_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/<u></u>WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide</=
a><br>
<br>
It&#39;s linear and not too long. Generally with this kind of guide I think=
 the tricky part is deciding what to leave out.<br>
<br>
Although it&#39;s sometimes out of date, I think that the above quick start=
 page is super useful and a good base to work from. It also comes up second=
 on a search for &#39;wordpress guide&#39; so it might be a good priority t=
o update. =A0In a spirit of helpfulness, I&#39;ll compare it to the Learn W=
ordPress and some specific articles that we created on floss manuals. Both =
resources have text and maybe even more usefully screenshots which can be p=
orted across. I&#39;ll post links and then make some comments.<br>


<br>
----//// begin comments<br>
<br>
A couple of general observations I think generally it is probably a bad ide=
a to link to external videos (especially pay for view ones) and external gu=
ides as they go out of date pretty quickly. Also, for me, references to alt=
ering css and template files don&#39;t have a place in a beginners guide ap=
art from maybe in a section on taking your knowledge further.<br>


<br>
<br>
** Installing, configuring and logging in<br>
<br>
<a href=3D"https://learn.wordpress.com/get-started/" target=3D"_blank">http=
s://learn.wordpress.com/<u></u>get-started/</a><br>
<a href=3D"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Get_Set_U=
p" target=3D"_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/<u></u>WordPress_Quick_Star=
t_Guide#<u></u>Get_Set_Up</a><br>
<a href=3D"http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/installling-on-a-server" ta=
rget=3D"_blank">http://en.flossmanuals.net/<u></u>wordpress/installling-on-=
a-<u></u>server</a><br>
<a href=3D"http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/logging-in" target=3D"_blan=
k">http://en.flossmanuals.net/<u></u>wordpress/logging-in</a><br>
<br>
So the first observation is that Learn WordPress is much easier. There&#39;=
s not much we can do about that. Both the codex and flossmanuals ones seem =
out of date and could do with a rewrite and links updated. It does seem to =
make sense to link to the 5 minute install and detailed instructions at the=
 Installing WordPress codex article here rather than to go into too much de=
tail.<br>


<br>
The quick start guide has some material in this section that I would probab=
ly move to a later section, this includes info on importing and site settin=
gs like permalinks, and comment settings. The LWP (Learn WordPress) quickly=
 moves on to an overview the dashboard. I think is a good idea.<br>


<br>
It would be good to have a quick guide with screen shots on how to log in t=
o your blog.<br>
<br>
**Intro to Dashboard / General Settings<br>
<br>
<a href=3D"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Explore_Y=

ttps://learn.wordpress.com/<u></u>get-acquainted/</a><br>
<a href=3D"http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/introduction-to-the-dashboa=
rd/" target=3D"_blank">http://en.flossmanuals.net/<u></u>wordpress/introduc=
tion-to-the-<u></u>dashboard/</a><br>
<br>
LWP and the FM (floss manuals) have short intro to the dashboard and genera=
l settings with some screen shots. We could just port some of this across a=
nd remove the out of date content.<br>
<br>
The entry on admin panel in codex is too detailed and non-linear <a href=3D=
"http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels" target=3D"_blank">http:/=
/codex.wordpress.org/<u></u>Administration_Panels</a><br>
The codex entry on the dashboard didn&#39;t seem focused on the priorities =
of the new user - <a href=3D"http://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_Screen" t=
arget=3D"_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/<u></u>Dashboard_Screen</a><br>


<br>

<br>
<a href=3D"https://learn.wordpress.com/get-focused/" target=3D"_blank">http=
s://learn.wordpress.com/<u></u>get-focused/</a><br>
<br>
The FM guide and quick guide don&#39;t contain anything on content but that=
 might be a nice thing to do as it breaks up the techiness of the guide.<br=
>
<br>
** Create Content<br>
<br>
<a href=3D"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Create_Co=
ntent" target=3D"_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/<u></u>WordPress_Quick_=
Start_Guide#<u></u>Create_Content</a><br>

k">http://en.flossmanuals.net/<u></u>wordpress/add-a-post</a><br>
<br>
For all of these guides there are sub entries for the different types of en=
tries, posts, pages, adding images, using wysiwig, adding links, tags, cate=
gories etc,<br>
<br>
The LWP guide is really pretty short and links out to additional content fo=
r more complicated steps like creating custom menus and adding image galler=
ies.<br>
<br>
The FM guide breaks up different functions like adding images, videos, imag=
e galleries into separate sections and gives step by step instructions with=
 screenshots.<br>
<br>
The quick guide has some of these sections but could do with some screensho=
ts.<br>
<br>
I think that ideally these section would be a self contained, visual summar=
y which gives a step by step example of how to do the most simple applicati=
on of a feature but which doesn&#39;t aim at completeness, linking out to m=
ore comprehensive information. I&#39;ve tried to do that here. Some may fin=
d the simplification offensive (sorry!).<br>


<a href=3D"http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/using-categories-and-tags/"=
 target=3D"_blank">http://en.flossmanuals.net/<u></u>wordpress/using-catego=
ries-<u></u>and-tags/</a><br>
<br>
There are loads of screenshots which can be ported from FM to codex for the=
se sections.<br>
<br>
Also missing in the codex is a quick into to adding user and roles - there =
is one in FM<br>
<a href=3D"http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/user-roles" target=3D"_blan=
k">http://en.flossmanuals.net/<u></u>wordpress/user-roles</a><br>
which is a summary of this codex page - <a href=3D"http://codex.wordpress.o=
rg/Roles_and_Capabilities" target=3D"_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/<u>=
</u>Roles_and_Capabilities</a><br>
with a step by step guide with screenshots on how to add users.<br>
<br>
** Style your site<br>
<br>
<a href=3D"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Style_You=
r_Site" target=3D"_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/<u></u>WordPress_Quick=
_Start_Guide#<u></u>Style_Your_Site</a><br>

ttp://en.flossmanuals.net/<u></u>wordpress/themes</a> =A0and see other chap=
ters in the Design section<br>
<br>
All three guides have got some good sections on themes and widgets. There i=
s some very user friendly text in LWP which could add something<br>
<br>
I also really like the idea of including something about using wordpress to=
 create a website.<br>
LWP links to this. <a href=3D"http://en.support.wordpress.com/using-wordpre=
ss-to-create-a-website/" target=3D"_blank">http://en.support.wordpress.<u><=
/u>com/using-wordpress-to-create-<u></u>a-website/</a><br>
FM has this quick guide - <a href=3D"http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/m=
aking-a-website-instead-of-a-blog/" target=3D"_blank">http://en.flossmanual=
s.net/<u></u>wordpress/making-a-website-<u></u>instead-of-a-blog/</a><br>
and this page on menus which I think is very valuable in this situation.<br=
>
<a href=3D"http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/using-menus/" target=3D"_bl=
ank">http://en.flossmanuals.net/<u></u>wordpress/using-menus/</a><br>
<br>
I think that the above menu page would be a good replacement for this secti=
on<br>
<a href=3D"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Configure=

a><br>
<br>
It is a big area to cover and both guides take the same tactic of describin=
g what plugins are, covering how to install them, giving examples of a few =
plugins and how they work.<br>

This is a useful page to link to<br>
<a href=3D"http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins" target=3D"_blank">h=
ttp://codex.wordpress.org/<u></u>Managing_Plugins</a><br>
It describes installing plugins with the built installer (with manual insta=

via ftp which is recommended in the current guide.<br>

Both FM and the quick guide have sections about taking it beyond the basics=
, analytics, upgrading, securing your installation. I guess the key here is=
 to keep it brief and link to good beginner friendly pages on the codex.<br=

<br>
I think the approach on the quick guide is good in terms of scope, modifyin=
g themes and understanding the loop. However, I think they need to lead the=
 user by the hand a lot more and give some practical examples before sendin=
g new users off deep into the heart of the codex. I know Martin who has bee=
n working on the FM guide is up for doing some work in this area soon so I =
can keep you updated on this.<br>

I hope that these observations and suggestions are taken in the spirit of c=

I only have sporadic access to good Internet and so I tend to sprint on the=

It would be greatly appreciated if members of the Docs Team are on hand to
keep an eye on http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:RecentChanges and the
http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/ P2 site and help out where and when you
can. I'm hoping to get some long neglected tasks accomplished and some
great ideas for new articles.

Saturday, May 26, 2012, there is an optional Codex BBQ party at my place
west of Portland. If there is enough interest, we'll be working on the
Codex all day and eating ourselves sick. One of my best friends, an amazing
cook, will be here cooking up a storm. Should be great fun.

I've been asked by several WordPress Meetups over the past year on how to
create a Codex night for their members. This will be a good experiment and
I'll have a report on how it went.

Thanks!

Lorelle

This is so exciting. The Docs team has been walking on egg shells for<br>
years over the confusion of the WordPress Handbook, and I&#39;m eager to se=
e<br>
new energy being sent in this direction.<br>
<br>
The close ties between the Forum and Codex have been there since the<br>
beginning. However, time and skills serving the Forum and the time and<br>
skills serving documentation are distinctive, as several people mentioned.<=
br>
I agree that there needs to be one or two people overseeing the<br>
organizational structure, management, and maintenance of the Codex.<br>
<br>
Having a site of our own has been essential and lacking, which is why we<br=
>
created the unofficial docs task list not long ago. It was critical that we=
<br>
find a better way of communicating and keeping our community connected than=
<br>
the mailing list. As it was &quot;unofficial,&quot; we haven&#39;t done muc=
h to promote<br>
it or work with it, but it was a start. We need to have a place to support<=
br>
and educate each other on how to write for the Codex and offer task lists<b=
r>
beyond those we&#39;ve had in the past on the Codex, so I&#39;m excited abo=
ut<br>
having our own space or making the current blog on WordPress.com official.<=
br>
<br>
The mailing list has not been the sole line of communication either. As<br>
many do, I work with many people one on one to help them write and edit for=
<br>
the Codex and assign tasks, communicating with the mailing list when<br>
necessary for edits and such.<br>
<br>
As we struggled to understand the role the WordPress Handbook and<br>
WordPress Lessons played in the role of documentation in the WordPress<br>
Community, we&#39;ve come to realize the Codex best serves the WordPress<br=
>
Community by providing support for issues found within the Forums,<br>
expanding upon Learn WordPress instructions for the WordPress Lessons<br>
section, and developing more extensive documentation and guides beyond the<=
br>
basics found within the help files, especially servicing developers and<br>
programmers.<br>
<br>
While melding together Forum and Codex sounds great on the surface, I<br>
agree with Andrea and others that we need to have one or more people<br>
focused on the bigger picture overseeing the Codex, thus supporting the<br>
overall WordPress Community better.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the survey, Jane, and for helping with all of this.<br>

Hi everyone. The results of the recent surveys to identify active<br>
contributors and elect team reps made it pretty clear that the docs team is=
<br>
in a bit of a slump, organizationally speaking. Only 5 people from the<br>
wp-docs post responded, and of those, 2 were new or not yet contributing,<b=
r>
and there was no consensus re reps among the remaining 3 respondents. It<br=

got me thinking about how we organize contributors, what has worked well<br=

elsewhere in the WP ecosystem and in other free software projects, and<br>
leads me to this proposal: what if we combined forums and docs into one<br>
Support team?<br>
<br>
Looking back at the Codex activity from the past six months or year,<br>
chunks of it have been tied to forum mods (like Ipstenu and Andrea_r),<br>
other contributor groups (like Chip on the Theme Review Team), and new<br>
releases. Not that how Automattic/WordPress.com organizes itself should<br>
decide anything, but their support team manages forums, email support, and<=
br>
docs, and it seems to work pretty well. They have a schedule for reviewing<=
br>
existing documentation so it never gets too far out of date, and the people=
<br>
on the front lines with users in the forums and via email can see very<br>
clearly where they need to beef up documentation. I&#39;m thinking this cou=
ld<br>
work well for .org, too. Those who are strong writers and just want to<br>
contribute to documentation could still do so, but within a context of what=
<br>
our user support needs are at any given time based on the actual support<br=
>
requests.<br>
<br>
What I&#39;m envisioning is less siloing of contributor personnel, with<br>
one group blog at <a href=3D"http://make.wordpress.org/support" target=3D"_=
blank">make.wordpress.org/support</a> that uses tags like<br>
forums and codex to organize posts, and has pages to help orient new<br>
contributors and get them started. These mailing lists could fade away in<b=
r>
favor of email subscriptions from the blog, which are more easily<br>
searchable and would be more visible to potential contributors. Within the<=
br>
uber-group, some people would naturally gravitate toward specific tasks<br>
while others would multi-task as they have been doing.<br>
<br>
Over time we could expand the purview of the group to include things<br>
like moderating instructional videos and comments at <a href=3D"http://word=
press.tv" target=3D"_blank">wordpress.tv</a>(and start embedding appropriat=
e videos into codex), possibly helping to<br>
staff in-person help desks in local communities and/or at events like<br>
WordCamps and Meetups, etc. I think the prospects are pretty exciting, and<=
br>
I could see this becoming the biggest and most active of all the<br>
contributor groups, which would be awesome.<br>
<br>
If there are any strong objections to this approach, please reply to<br>
this thread today so we can discuss. If not, and everyone is willing to<br>
give this a shot and all work together (at least as an experiment for, say,=
<br>
the next release cycle or two), I&#39;ll go ahead and set up the group blog=
<br>
tomorrow.<br>
