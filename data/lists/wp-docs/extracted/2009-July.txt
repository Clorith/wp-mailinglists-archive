Hi,

I've just joined the WP Docs list. I'm a web developer and technical 
writer and i've been building sites using Wordpress for about 18 months now.

Looking through the archives, i notice that there's been virtually no 
activity in this list since January - is this list still functioning?

I've used the codex a lot over the last year and a half and i think it's 
really good and very useful. However, i usually find it incredibly hard 
to find the information that i need. I'm generally fairly confident that 
it'll be there somewhere, but finding it can be a major challenge.

I'd be keen to do some work creating more useful indexes if others think 
it's a good idea.

I haven't got a clear idea of how to organise it, but my most recent 
foray into the codex has been to find out all everything i needed to 
know to develop a plugin - and it might be worth starting with a list of 
all documents related to plugin development, as i've already started 
compiling that.

It is still alive Will. I'm not exactly sure why it has been so quiet,
but it is still kicking.

I think many people will agree with you that the organization is far
from ideal. The rule of thumb with the Codex is if you want to improve
it, more power to you, go to it.

If you would like to mock up an example, you can do that by building
sub-pages off of your own account page. Then you can send out links on
the list for people to view and comment on.

I think the most useful guides to the Codex would be project based
How To guides. Such guides create order out of the chaos of the Codex.

Thanks for your willingness to help!

If you start from Developer Docs, there is a Plugin section that has a 
"comprehensive plugin resources" page already... maybe you can start 
with that?

Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. That's probably where i started my 
search for the information i needed to build a plugin - and i definitely 
didn't find everything i needed there. I'll have a look at that and see 
if i can add anything to it.

Thanks

Yeah. Pretty much all the information is already in the codex, a How To 
guide would just require a page of links with some text pulling them all 
together.

Is there any way to get a complete list of all pages in the codex?

A comprehensive index of pages would be useful.

Thanks. That's interesting.

But it's not really particularly useful, is it? There's all sorts in 
there - chucked in together in a mish-mash of different languages and 
different types of pages.

The more i think about it, the more i think that a complete, browsable 
index of all pages would be useful for a documentation system like this. 
Actually, i'd say it's essential - and the lack of it is a contributing 
factor to why it's so hard to find anything in the codex.

I guess wikis aren't designed to be indexed in that way though, are they?

It would be nice to work out a way to get a meaningful dynamic index of 
pages. Something that doesn't rely on people adding pages to it 
manually. There's so much good documentation buried in the codex it's a 
shame that some of it is so hard to find.

As everyone has said, welcome to the Codex and WordPress Documentation Team.

Be sure and check out the guidelines for editing and working with the Codex
under the Community Portal. These will help you figure out how it all works.

I've been working on indexing and building a new table of contents for a
while, unfortunately, there is a LOT of clean up involved in the process, as
you noted on the AllPages results. I've been cleaning as I go, but it's
incredibly time consuming.

Here is my recommendation if you would like to help me build a better
functioning index pages, from which we can then work on the table of
contents. The process needs to start with Categories, not just specific
pages.

* Ensure EVERY page on the Codex has the proper Category at the bottom of
each page. A page can be in more than one category, but we have to be REALLY
specific about categorizing the documents. A document on Plugins should go
in the Plugins category, but if it is really basic, it should also go in
WordPress Lessons, but if complicated and very "developer" then it also
needs a cross reference in the Developer category, right? It's a tough call
sometimes but think about how the user will hunt for the information and
sort accordingly.

* A powerful Index page can be created from the categories, I hope, making
the process easier. *DO NOT *try to create a "static" list of pages as an
index page as that will be a tedious and painful page to keep updated.
Hasn't MediaWiki comes up with tags yet? :D That would be the simplest way
to create an automatic Index page based upon the keywords in the document.

* Foreign Language articles - We need to put the articles in different
languages into their own language specific categories. That will help get
those articles into their own grouping, and help us get that information to
the people who need it. Check the categorization and language guidelines for
how to categorized those. Let's get them out of the English categories, if
they are in them currently. This will also help us know which pages have
been translated and which need to be translated, helping the polyglots team.

* There are a LOT of unfinished documents on the Codex, including ones that
need updating for the various versions. If the document is intensely version
specific, it needs to be categorized per version number with a note at the
top that the document only applies to that specific version - or updated or
removed. If you find a document in question on this and it isn't clear, post
it to this list and I or others on the team will make a command decision. In
general, my vote is for any information older than WordPress 2.6 be marked
as deprecated or out-of-date. Unfortunately, there are still plenty using
that version and older, though many in the WordPress Community are
campaigning hard for updates.

* I've been on and of researching how to automatically update Table of
Contents pages via categories with MediaWiki. Anyone found anything on that
yet? It is so simple, in many ways, but I haven't found any way to do that.
If we can find a way to pull the information from the database base upon
Categories, then keeping a topic specific table of contents would be so much
easier.

I'd also like to note that while Matt and others are working on the
WordPress Handbook using Subversion, that is a different subject, though it
is totally based upon the Codex content and guides. The documents in the
Handbook will be technically specific and stripped down to how WordPress
works, not offering indepth guides, as the Codex does. I'd love to see more
guides in the Codex, giving people more detailed, step by step instructions,
with video or audio files accompanying them. I'm working on my schedule so
we can do a full campaign on that soon, just to give you all a heads up.

Thanks again for pitching in, and I hope everyone can jump into a specific
section to start adding and updating those categories so we can make the
process of updating the table of contents and creating a core index page
much easier!

Are there any category guidelines anywhere? I've looked, but i haven't 
found it.

I'm happy to spend as much time as i can going through the codex and 
categorizing articles. It will be a good way to get to know what's in 
there, anyway.

For development type subjects, at least, i think the categories may need 
to be more fine grained than that if they're going to be really useful.

If non-English languages are going to be in their own categories, surely 
English language articles need to be categorized "English"? Maybe i've 
missed something, but that doesn't appear to be happening.

Where are they? (Is it just me that can't find anything in this wiki?)

The search is not great, or should I say the search in the theme. If  
you know mediawiki and can get to it's search page it's 6000% better.

I know we thoroughly documented the categories structure and guidelines, but
I can't find them where they are supposed to be. So I fixed it on the
following pages:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines#Codex_Categories

http://codex.wordpress.org/Help:Editing#Categories

http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Maintenance

I also spent some time going over the
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Categories list and wanted to cry - the
same emotion I feel every time I go to that page and find that all our
beautiful work has been mangled again.

Here are the conventions and we need folks to start digging in and fixing
these.

1. All categories must have Capital Letters not lower case as MediaWiki
treats "WordPress Lessons" and "wordpress lessons" and "WordPress lessons"
as three different pages. All pages with the lower case versions must have
their categories changed to the appropriate cap version.

2. All foreign language pages must be categorized with their proper foreign
category name, with the two letter language code in front of the category
name, per the example in the Guidelines. The only exception is the country
or language specific main category.

This two prong system does two important things. First, it groups all
content into a specific "Codex section" for that language and second, it
puts all language specific content in that language code. So if you click
the French Codex category, you will find all the documents in French. If you
click the fr:Panneaux_Administration, you will find all the articles about
the Administration Panels in French. If you don't speak the language, at
least try to recognize the language enough to get it in the right Codex
language section to help out those volunteers.

3. Keep Categories SPECIFIC and matched to the Table of Contents and
WordPress features. As outlined in the guidelines, the categories need to be
in keeping with the current table of contents as much as possible. I'm
working on a total restructing of the table of contents, but keep finding
myself distracted with the never ending clean up of content, so your help in
grouping things by category and cleaning as you go will help the TOC efforts
dramatically. I'd love to find a way to do all our TOC by categories
automatically. Still hunting for a MediaWiki solution - hint hint!

4. Fear NOT Overcategorization: For right now, I'd rather see the content in
many related categories rather than only a few. Use your best judgment, and
be specific, but let's make sure we help users find the information without
being overwhelmed. Check a category to see if it is appropriate, as well as
overloaded or not, if it helps you to decide where a document should be
placed.

5. Categorize the Uncategorized: Check
http://codex.wordpress.org/Category:Uncategorized for uncategorized content
and start categorizing.

6. Check each category in the
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Categoriesto ensure the articles
within it are categorized appropriately.

7. Why not add category links when appropriate within the content? To make a
link in the content to a category, use a colon in front of the word
"Category" such as [[:Category:WordPress_Lessons|WordPress Lessons
category]] to guide people to related content.

And please tell me who to shoot that came up with UI Link as a category
name. Do not make me tell you why it sucks as a category name. There are 56
pages that have to be changed to something more appropriate like
Administration Panels. SIGH.

Once we've moved all the inappropriate categories to proper categories (you
should be able to tell the diff, such as wrongly capped categories and bad
category names), and they read zero members, let me know and I'll delete
them. We don't need to do redirects on any of those as I don't think many
are linking to categories. I'll check for backlinks before deleting them.

This can be part of the boring work of volunteering on the Codex, but it is
the most important work, too. The better we can categorize the content, the
better we can help users find the information they need.

Once we get these cleaned up, I'll also make a category "cloud" unless we
can find an add-on or extension that will do that automatically. There must
be auto things like this by now, isn't there?

RED LINKS
I've just noticed that the red links indicative of a page with no content
aren't working. HOW did I miss THAT? I've asked that the red link style be
added back to help us find the links to pages without content so we can fix
that.

SNARK ALERT
While going through some of the documents to write the guidelines and check
out the categories, I found some snarky comments in the docs. They are
subtle but there. Pay close attention to any snarky comments and help clean
those out, please, if you find them.

They are usually things phrased like, "If you want a better way to do this,
see this..." leading to an external link, or "..but it doesn't always work"
which isn't helpful nor informative since there isn't an explanation as to
why or alternatives. These are just subtle "editorial comments" but also
look out for snark comments that are more accusatory. The WordPress Codex is
pretty strict on the editorial guidelines keeping the "I" out of the
documentation and being neutral but enthusiastic in tone, so help us keep
any little snarky commentaries out. Thanks.

Thanks to all! And thanks for cacthing this issue about the lack of category
guidelines. I am sure that MichaelH and the rest of the team came up with
those a few years ago. We worked so hard on setting up the categories in the
first place. Odd. So thanks for noticing.

1. All categories must have Capital Letters not lower case as MediaWiki
treats "WordPress Lessons" and "wordpress lessons" and "WordPress lessons"
as three different pages. All pages with the lower case versions must have
their categories changed to the cap version.

2. All foreign language pages must be categorized with their proper foreign

That would be me.  Those are articles that are linked, in some fashion, in 
the core product. Not all articles linked to from core are Administration 
Panels e.g. http://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time so 
Administration Panels would not seem to be the appropriate category for 
those, as Administration Panels denote articles that explain an admin 
function e.g. Settings->General.

Ah, so it is you I should shoot. :D

I understand the purpose, now we need a better name since most people
hitting the Codex have no clue what UI means, though I'm sure they can come
up with some very interesting ideas and suggestions. hee hee

What do you recommend that is more search and keyword specific?

"UI Link" hasn't bothered me since I created it three years ago.

For those that didn't notice, the description of each Category, if there is 
one, is at the top of each Category's page.  For example 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Category:UI_Link

Even though this article is categorized "About Codex", it doesn't appear 
on the "About Codex" category page. I had assumed that this was 
something that happened automatically, but it looks like it doesn't. Do 
we have to add them manually? Or is there a bot that does it? Or have i 
missed something?

I'll make a start on changing "Wordpress Development" to "WordPress 
Development" in the 169 pages where it's wrong.

Thinking about that a bit more... Maybe it would be less work to write a 
bot to do that. The disadvantage would be that i wouldn't get to explore 
all those 169 pages, but it would probably be a lot less work in the 
long run.

By "foreign", i assume you mean "not English" (the internet's a big 
place and "foreign" doesn't mean "not English" in most of it!). If 
English language pages aren't categorized, how do you list just pages 
that are in English?

The first one i looked at in the "Wordpress Development" category - 
"Adding Administration Menus" - is categorized "WordPress Development", 
not "Wordpress Development".

I don't understand why that happens. But if it does happen, surely it 
makes the task of fixing these things virtually impossible, because you 
can't tell what's been fixed and what hasn't.

Looking at the "Wordpress Development" category page again, though, it's 
telling me that page doesn't exist - even though there's a list of pages 
there. This wiki stuff is weird!

Oops! It was obviously a bit early in the morning when i wrote that! I 
was looking for a page called "Codex Categories", but of course the page 
is "Codex:Guidelines" - which *is* there.

The "New page created" category says

"The following pages are newly-created and are available for the 
document team to discuss, categorize, edit, and name."

There are 339 pages in this category. Picking two at random, one was 
created in 2007 and the other in late 2008. Is there any point to this 
category? It seems to be just adding to the clutter. Surely there's no 
chance of a backlog of 339 pages ever being cleared, is there?

Subject: [wp-docs] theme and plugin compatibility pages
Message-ID: <Y9y8tLDcLeVKFw7e@dsl-217-155-35-239.zen.co.uk>

So last night I am checking for changes on the codex as I do, to purge 
off spam and the like, and I see that seo-dave has added masses of links 
to theme compat pages for 2.8 and 2.3, so I undo them.  We do that a 
couple of times.  seo-dave drops a message on my talk page this morning 
asking why I am reverting the changes.

So I explain in there that I'm reverting them because it looks like spam 
to me.

Anyway, his views and mine clearly differ as to what constitutes spam. 
To me, though, the theme compatibility pages and the plugin compat pages 
just look like long link-lists that can be taken advantage of.  I'm not 
convinced what their purpose is within the codex.

To me, it would seem that if there's known issues with a theme, maybe 
that section belongs in the codex, but what's the point in the rest? 
Themes that pass the criteria appear in the WordPress Theme browser, I'm 
not sure why there is a codex page for the themes that people are 
essentially making a profit off.

For now I guess I will have to leave these pages and not prune them of 
spam links as I would everywhere else.

Any clarification is appreciated.

That's a hard-one.  And not sure if it's worth the hassle to edit 
those...and wonder as you do "what's the point?"

It's real easy to spot these people--zero contributions to Codex, and then 
they put their theme (or plugin) not only in the current compatibility list, 
but also older compatibility pages.  Generally I revert edits to older 
compatibility pages.

Not much of an answer, I know.

I'm trying to see the issue here and it seems like the addition of these
links to the compatibility pages go beyond the purpose of the page, which is
to list which Themes/Plugins are compatible with this version of WordPress.

Single links to the Themes that are compatible with this version are
appropriate. Single links to Themes with updates are also appropriate. More
than one link to any Theme or Plugin beyond a link to the page on
WordPress.org or their author page (minimum two links) goes beyond
usefulness into spammy.

We're going to have to trust your best judgment on this. If you think
anything beyond that is spammy, kill it. :D

And thanks for staying on top of this. It's a very important page that
people link to and refer to from all over the web and it's important that it
represent us well.

One of the problems we all face is when jargon becomes so familiar, we lose
sight of how it impacts others. I taught a two day workshop on blogging and
social media last week for a group of scientists and researchers working for
the government. I work very hard to use words familiar to most people. At
the end of the first day, after completing a section on using WordPress and
fighting comment spam and copyright infringement, I laughed and cringed
equally when two people agreed that I used more jargon and buzz words than
they did in their positions - and they are KNOWN for their jargon and buzz
words.

I assumed that blog talk had been around long enough people were now
familiar with twitter, tweet, splog, scraper, spammer, and so on. They
weren't.

Few people in the real day to day world know what UI is, and this is a prime
example of the need for clarity in a category name. If it were "WordPress
Interface" or "WordPress Functionality" or "How to Use WordPress" people who
don't speak geek or blog would understand and click. But how many understand
what UI Links mean? And what are "User Interface Links" anyway? A collection
of links to pages dealing with the interface of WordPress? Shjpuld we have a
category to name a group of links?

I know we can do better, using the categories as guides and navigation for
people of all levels.

So if we keep this category, what would be a more appropriate name? Or
should we get rid of it and assign these articles to more appropriate
categories?

This is not to pick on anyone naming a category, it's to clean things up so
we move towards a better reptuation for the WordPress Codex to be more
helpful than confusing, a long time goal of mine.

Thanks!

For that particular category, how about renaming it:
    Linked to from WordPress Screens
or something like that?

I think we do need the category, as it denotes pages that really 
cannot be renamed or repurposed without serious thought, because the 
WP software has links directly to those pages (or even to subsections 
of the page).

The category was created to make it easy to find all the pages that are 
pointed to in the core product.  I'd guess every article in that category, 
is also included in another category, meaning those other categories are 
probably how those articles would typically be accessed.

I don't have a problem with the category and can't really recommend a better 
designation.

Periodically I will go through the core UI to confirm that the links are 
still working, please don't delete that category.

Regards.

I'm not sure i've been around long enough to express an opinion on this, 
but i'm going to anyway! ;-)

I can't see that having a jargon name for this particular category is 
likely to be a problem. No non-tech people are ever likely to need to 
use it.

As i understand it, the only real purpose of this category is to be able 
to identify all the pages that are linked to in the WP software or 
accompanying files - and the only people it's likely to be of interest 
to are WP developers and codex maintainers.

As a category it has no other significance and therefore giving it an 
apparently useful name might just lead people down a path that's of no 
use to them.

However, everyone will *see* the category listed on each page that is 
a member of the category, which is why I agree with Lorelle that it 
should have a non-jargon name, rather than a name they cannot understand.

That's the crux of it all really.  IMO when someone comes and plants 15+ 
links to essentially one site on this page, it makes it look bad.

My problem as someone essentially trying to moderate that is that - on 
the face of it - it is 15 separate links to separate themes.

I just baulk at the thought that what is essentially a help site is 
being used as link fodder.  Mutliple themes may indeed be hosted on the 
target site, but it's against the spirit of the page, I think.  Still, 
I'm not prepared to get into "undo battles" over it.

Do we need some kind of guidance on the page itself to cover off, say, 
max links per site, or that if you have a site with many themes it 
should come under one link?  I think that that should satisfy anyone who 
has a legitimate use of the page whilst allowing spam to be pruned 
effectively.

Looks like the link spammers have a new tactic - publish a load of links 
and then revert the changes.

How nice, they are tidying up after themselves now. Saves me a job I 
guess.

Thus the links still remain in the revision history, immutable.

I suggest adding a line to "Disallow: /index.php" in
http://codex.wordpress.org/robots.txt.

The time will come when those pages should go completely and we should  
refer people to Extend.

This of course needs to be combined with a way of the community being  
able to mark plugins/themes on Extend as compatible and compatibility  
being searchable.

Good.  For the time being we seem to have reached an acceptable solution 
which is to consolidate the multiple-theme sites.

Most of them (> 250) are mine. I didn't realize I was going to add that
many until, well, I did. At first I did them as new pages because I was
timid and unsure I was doing everything alright.

They are all incomplete in that they contain no examples. I think Raimy
has been adding related functions (thank you, sir).

Now that 2.8.1 is out I was hoping to crank out about 300 new function
reference pages before October, 2009. Almost doubling the current count.


Should I not mark them new?

Probably a good idea not to mark them new.

Just heard from Barry Abrahamson of Automattic/WordPress about the issue of
protecting the Codex from the spammers who revert their own spammy
intrusions into the Codex:

- - - - - - - - -

Did a few things:

1) Added robots.txt as Jeremy suggested.
2) Enabled the revision delete permission for syspos -- you can read more
here:

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:RevisionDelete

This should allow you to easily hide the contents of a spam revision from
the history, etc.

- - - - - - - - - -

Thanks, Barry!!!!!

This should help. Please report in if you are having any trouble with these
changes.

Thanks,

Lorelle

I've been thinking about this issue. It was a big deal when there were
dramatic differences between versions which impacted which Theme and Plugin.
When the Plugin directory (extend) came fully into being, we finally removed
all the Plugin links pages. We got rid of cataloging Themes a long time ago,
so remind me again why we need to do this compatibility list if WordPress
now has auto-updating and installation of Themes and Plugins?

The key question on the compatibility lists is to which version are we going
to manually pay tribute to those who keep their work updated and not?

What do you all say about stopping the manual compatibility pages for
Plugins and Themes for the next release of WordPress?

Lorelle:

That sounds good to me. What about adding some functionality to the 
Extend section to be able to sort plugins/themes by what version they 
list as being compatible with (use Compatible up to: version number)? 
Would make it easier to sort up-to-date plugins from old/dead/abandoned 
plugins.

It seems reasonable, given the built-in browsers.

Frankly the bit that narks me about the "compatibility" pages is when 
they are used as advertising platforms for premium content.  I'm all for 
people having links to stuff that they have worked hard on, but when 
they are coining it in as a result it does not sit right with me.

I'm totally with you all on this. I have never been happy about the
promotion of "premium" stuff on the Codex in any way.

And I think it is natural to add an option for versions, especially as the
information is already in there. I think it should be sortable by versions.

So who do we talk to on the WordPress/Automattic staff handling the Extend
projects to nag them to make this happen? Hmmm, can't remember. I'll have to
ask. Do you know?

I've been talking to Ryan and the guys for a while about this (I like  
everything to be sortable, and the lack of compatibility info in  
plugin search results and list screen in admin bugs me). There are  
some issues around plugin authors not keeping the text snippet that  
provides the "'compatible up to" up to date. Before we add the sort  
function, we're looking at the bigger picture of how to make sure that  
information is up to date. We've talked about building a system for  
users to verify a plugin works with version x, and have that override  
the plugin author's outdated note. Still figuring it out.

This has been a long time coming, and the whole WordPress Community is eager
for sort options on the Theme and Plugin directories.

We're trying to figure out a timeline as to when we should start a
moratorium on updating and creating the compatibility pages. Not to be a
total nag, but any idea on the roadmap for this? The compilation of these is
a lot of work and takes a lot of time. I'd love to shorten it down as soon
as possible.

Thanks for jumping in!

Personally I would vote for culling these at the next release, 
regardless of whether the compatible with feature is implemented by then 
or not.

Either that, or change the format of the next set of compatibility pages 
so that they are like the automatic upgrade host compatibility pages - 
IE non-linked.

Or just make them a set of "INcompatibility pages" to list 
themes/plugins with known issues.  ;)

After talking it over with Jane, here is what I think.

Hopefully, by WordPress 2.9 the ability to inform the user that a Plugin or
Theme is not compatible with the WordPress version upgrade should be in
place. If the Theme or Plugin is in the "official" Extend directories, they
will be requested to upgrade those before upgrading WordPress, or some such
process. If the Theme or Plugin is not from the Extend directories, they
will get a message informing them that information is not available. They
are still working on finalizing how that will all work.

For us, two things happen.

1. The need to create and update the compatibility pages stops. The job will
be taken over by the interface (Administration Panels). We will just need to
put our energy into educational articles that continue to help people
upgrade their Themes or Plugins manually - for themselves or developers. In
other words, what changes have to made to a Theme to make it compatible with
the new version that go beyond just having the original Theme author update
their Theme (for those who created their own).

2. We need to start educating users NOT to look to the compatibility pages
but to the interface for compatibility information. This has to wait until
we have a clear outline on the process, but start thinking about how we can
inform and educate the WordPress Community from within as well as outside of
the documentation.

Thanks again for bringing this up. I'd love to spend more time creating
great documentation and educational articles than babysitting the old stuff
that is obsolete, so I'm thrilled about this step in the improvement of the
WordPress Administration Panels.

I imagine that would be an easy enough part.  The last remaining 
compatibility pages could have such a message placed on them. 
Potentially even a final 2.9 set of pages could be created (without 
theme link content), have a message on them to look at the admin pages 
for compatibility info, and then be protected (or not, whichever).

Of course that message would need to wait for the implementation of the 
feature, but the pages (meanwhile) could point people to the admin 
interface in order to find compatible themes (as, for the most part, 
such themes are kept compatible I suspect.)

Sounds like a plan.

I know that many of you publish WordPress related news on your own blogs, so
helping to spread the word there, and via the other mailing lists for
WordPress volunteers, when we have something to say about this, will also
really help.

Right now, it's just waiting for the final okay to implement this and then
let's start spreading the word. A lot of people depend upon those docs, so
this is a big team effort to spread the words.

Thanks!

As it does seem to be a relatively FAQ on the forums, and I couldn't see 
it, I've added a new FAQ 
http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked which gives a few 
hints on what to do if your site was hacked, along with pointers to a 
couple of decent web pages on the matter.
