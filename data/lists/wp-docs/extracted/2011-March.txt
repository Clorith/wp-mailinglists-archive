Hello, everyone

I noticed below users contribute nothing for Codex,but it seems they think
themselves are the top administrators of Codex,
and also tried to make a rule according to *their own ideas*,
and also ignored/contempt the contributions from others.
Is there any real WP staff here can help to confirm they have the
qualification to be an scout?

Well it's a bit hard to tell what those two users think, but they are not 
administrators.

You can keep an eye on them with these two links:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Contributions/Tommyang
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Contributions/Jiehanzheng


Thanks for the heads-up.

I'm struggling to follow the thread of conversation to be honest, what 
with it being in a language I can only read through Google-translate, 
and in a mixed-up order timewise.

However, I can tell you that none of the mentioned people are codex 
admins.

Further, to answer one of the points that was raised by someone at some 
point - a number of the codex admins do subscribe to this list.

I agree that the conversation is a bit hard to follow. Can you be specific
what what offensive or issue is being had with the person? That would really
help us.

The "supervisor" administrator list is here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:ListUsers/sysop and I don't see their
name on that list. It is a locked down list and probably desperately in need
of updating, too. Which makes it confusing as to why you think they are
administrators.

Anyone can contribute to the WordPress Codex, and is welcome to do so as
long as they do so within our guidelines.

Thanks for taking this on as we're having trouble with the direct
translation. It is much appreciated.

Lorelle

I think one of the parties involved here has just posted to my user talk 
page and, from what that comment points to, this seems to revolve around 
adding a external  URL and email link on to the page zh-cn:?? 
wp-config.php

For what it's worth, I don't think such external links are necessary in 
that location, especially not where they add no particular value to the 
page in question. In terms of adding translator information, I would say 
that a link to a user page *is* acceptable, but more than that is 
basically self-promotion and not relevant to the codex.

It should also be considered that people updating the English language 
versions of the pages do not put "credits" on the pages, even when they 
invest a lot of time and effort into them.

There are *no guideline* mention the translator can't left personal
information to self-promote and we also can find the same on other language
page.
As a respect to contributor  I think it should be talked before they remove
anything--even their actions probably are right.

Jiehanzheng left his/her personal imformation(personal email etc) on page:
http://cn.wordpress.org/contact/ before so I thought he/she was an
administrator, but it seems only his/her name is remained on this page now.

"???" on this page http://cn.wordpress.org/contact/ means "administrator"
But I didn't find any similar on others like http://tw.wordpress.org/about/

Well, I have a few points to clarify.

I18n sites are maintained by WP Polyglots team, but not Docs team -- if you
think my behavior were not reasonable, please feel free to report them to WP
Polyglots team. The reason I put my email address on the Contact page of
cn.wordpress.org is that I cannot get what people submitted by the contact
form, so that I put my email address onto that page. Given that the local
forum (zh-cn.forums.wordpress.org) were up weeks ago, the email is no longer
useful, so I removed my email from that page.

Thank you for reading through pages on cn.wordpress.org!

If one is adding documentation to the Codex for purposes of self-promotion,
one should probably reconsider those motives.

The purpose of the Codex is to share information and documentation about
WordPress, not to gain self-promotion.

I think they are different.

In the past, we've permitted contact information on the User page. That is
fair since many have various methods of contact beyond the User Talk page
for those who wish to volunteer or had a specific question, though it isn't
really encouraged. We've long had a ban on direct contact with volunteers
for free support questions as those often come in the middle of the night as
people do not know which time zone the other is in. Trust me, I know this
well. But if they wish to share their contact information on their User
page, that is fine, as long as it is not for self promotion.

Thank you again for staying on top of this, and thanks to these people
sincere in wanting to help and still learning how this all works. The
Polyglot group is very welcoming and has done much to help the Codex.

Took me a while to read through all this and to figure out the conversation.

To clarify everything:
- Leaving direct contact information or anything else on your own
User: page  is okay.
- Leaving the same type of contact information on a regular
documentation page is not okay.

Specifically, this type of contact info (at the very bottom of the
page) is not okay:
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=zh-cn:%E7%BC%96%E8%BE%91_wp-config.php&oldid=83403

The edits made to remove that from the page were correct.
Documentation pages should not be "signed" and should not contain
links to anybody's email address, User pages, or anything else like
that. Everything on the documentation page should be documentation in
some fashion.

Hope that clears everything up.

-Otto

We're eventually going to transition the wp.com blogs (wpdevel, wppolyglots)
to make.wordpress.org. If you'd like a make.wordpress.org/codex, let me know
and I'll take care of it.

The plan was for make.wordpress.org/documetation, not /codex, so it 
could accommodate more than just codex.

Subject: [wp-docs] Styles - image align
Message-ID: <02b701cbe6e0$46633280$d3299780$@com>

Hey guys,

First time contributing to a mailing list, sorry if I'm doing something
wrong.

 

Just have a question about how I find out who manages css/codex styling. I
was browsing the Codex:Styles page, and noticed that none of the image align
functions work.

 

So, for example: [[Image:codex-logo-2.png]] displays as you would expect,
inline, within the text. But [[Image:codex-logo-2.png|right|thumbnail]]
displays the image on the left, ignoring the right align float, and weirdly
disturbing the first two lines of following text.

 

Visit my usertalk at http://codex.wordpress.org/User_talk:Bigonroad for an
example of this

 

Who do I talk to to fix this? I know its pretty minor, but from having a
look at the css, it appears that all it needs is .tright {float:right;}
added to the stylesheet.

 

Bless,

Chris

This was "fixed" a year or more ago. Did something happen?

Quite messed. I created articles and moved some content from Using Images I don?t feel confident enought for writting up some needed content in Inserting Images into Posts and Pages I think should be a step by step with images, just a basic usage with no references to template tags, themes etc. plain basic usage.

I can add images if ok to use showcase as reference (?)

Thanks, and sorry for any confusion out there
