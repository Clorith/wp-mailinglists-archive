Hi Docs list subscribers. You may have seen notices to the forum and 
theme review contributor groups recently leading to a survey intended to 
identify a group liaison as we begin the work of creating more 
collaboration and integration between contributor groups. Unlike Forums 
and TRT, I can't run a report to see a list of posting frequency, 
commits, etc (and neither can Otto), so the survey for the Docs team is 
a little more free form. It basically asks you to identify who on the 
docs team you consider to be:
- most active
- most helpful
- best quality writing/editing

If you could fill in the survey within the next day or two, that would 
be great. It will help with figuring out how many active contributors wo 
have, and as we start to talk about the possibility of organizing a 
contributor summit (like the core team meetup, but all the contributor 
groups), knowing how many people are involved, active, lapsed, etc will 
be important.

The survey is at 
http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/docs-contributor-survey
In an attempt to reduce spam, it is password protected: wordpressdocs2012

Thanks!
Jane

Hello,

I've just added myself to the team a few weeks ago, so I won't show up on
anybody's lists. However, I would like to be considered "active." I suppose
if I had sent a "welcome" email, it might have helped :) I look forward to
contributing.

Regards.

Hi Lorelle,

I would like to be more than minimally active (not sure what the "levels"
of activity are, though). Most of my contract work is WordPress development
(mostly plugins) and it's my favorite work to boot. I've also written a
book for McGraw-Hill (not on PHP or WordPress) and I'm working with another
publisher at the moment, though still in the proposal stage after knocking
around a few ideas...so, I like to write, I like to edit, I love WordPress.
I will be working with a business partner this summer on theme development,
which I know very little about, so it'll be a good experience. If there's
some way in particular I can be useful, let me know. I've been following
the this list for the last few weeks to get a feel for how things work.

Regards,

 From the first posts in this thread, what I understand is the gap in 
the code is one place where you can send new WordPress users to use 
their new WordPress site. Essentially, something as user friendly as 
Learn WordPress (https://learn.wordpress.com/) but targeted at people 
using self-hosted blogs.

So all the information is already on the codex but as I see it the 
challenge is to;

* cut this information down to say something about the same length as 
Learn WordPress
* add screenshots to make it more user friendly
* create a linear format that new user can work through
* self contained, so that it can be used as a base for other guides

The closest page I could come to that was this one.
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide

It's linear and not too long. Generally with this kind of guide I think 
the tricky part is deciding what to leave out.

Although it's sometimes out of date, I think that the above quick start 
page is super useful and a good base to work from. It also comes up 
second on a search for 'wordpress guide' so it might be a good priority 
to update.  In a spirit of helpfulness, I'll compare it to the Learn 
WordPress and some specific articles that we created on floss manuals. 
Both resources have text and maybe even more usefully screenshots which 
can be ported across. I'll post links and then make some comments.

----//// begin comments

A couple of general observations I think generally it is probably a bad 
idea to link to external videos (especially pay for view ones) and 
external guides as they go out of date pretty quickly. Also, for me, 
references to altering css and template files don't have a place in a 
beginners guide apart from maybe in a section on taking your knowledge 
further.


** Installing, configuring and logging in

https://learn.wordpress.com/get-started/
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Get_Set_Up
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/installling-on-a-server
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/logging-in

So the first observation is that Learn WordPress is much easier. There's 
not much we can do about that. Both the codex and flossmanuals ones seem 
out of date and could do with a rewrite and links updated. It does seem 
to make sense to link to the 5 minute install and detailed instructions 
at the Installing WordPress codex article here rather than to go into 
too much detail.

The quick start guide has some material in this section that I would 
probably move to a later section, this includes info on importing and 
site settings like permalinks, and comment settings. The LWP (Learn 
WordPress) quickly moves on to an overview the dashboard. I think is a 
good idea.

It would be good to have a quick guide with screen shots on how to log 
in to your blog.

**Intro to Dashboard / General Settings

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Explore_Your_New_WordPress_Blog
https://learn.wordpress.com/get-acquainted/
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/introduction-to-the-dashboard/

LWP and the FM (floss manuals) have short intro to the dashboard and 
general settings with some screen shots. We could just port some of this 
across and remove the out of date content.

The entry on admin panel in codex is too detailed and non-linear 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels
The codex entry on the dashboard didn't seem focused on the priorities 
of the new user - http://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_Screen

** Get Focused

https://learn.wordpress.com/get-focused/

The FM guide and quick guide don't contain anything on content but that 
might be a nice thing to do as it breaks up the techiness of the guide.

** Create Content

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Create_Content
https://learn.wordpress.com/get-published/
https://learn.wordpress.com/get-flashy/
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/add-a-post

For all of these guides there are sub entries for the different types of 
entries, posts, pages, adding images, using wysiwig, adding links, tags, 
categories etc,

The LWP guide is really pretty short and links out to additional content 
for more complicated steps like creating custom menus and adding image 
galleries.

The FM guide breaks up different functions like adding images, videos, 
image galleries into separate sections and gives step by step 
instructions with screenshots.

The quick guide has some of these sections but could do with some 
screenshots.

I think that ideally these section would be a self contained, visual 
summary which gives a step by step example of how to do the most simple 
application of a feature but which doesn't aim at completeness, linking 
out to more comprehensive information. I've tried to do that here. Some 
may find the simplification offensive (sorry!).
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/using-categories-and-tags/

There are loads of screenshots which can be ported from FM to codex for 
these sections.

Also missing in the codex is a quick into to adding user and roles - 
there is one in FM
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/user-roles
which is a summary of this codex page - 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities
with a step by step guide with screenshots on how to add users.

** Style your site

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Style_Your_Site
https://learn.wordpress.com/get-customized/
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/themes  and see other chapters in 
the Design section

All three guides have got some good sections on themes and widgets. 
There is some very user friendly text in LWP which could add something

I also really like the idea of including something about using wordpress 
to create a website.
LWP links to this. 
http://en.support.wordpress.com/using-wordpress-to-create-a-website/
FM has this quick guide - 
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/making-a-website-instead-of-a-blog/
and this page on menus which I think is very valuable in this situation.
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/using-menus/

I think that the above menu page would be a good replacement for this 
section
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Configure_How_Your_Pages_Appear

** Add More Functionality / Plugins

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Add_More_Functionality
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/intro-to-plugins/

It is a big area to cover and both guides take the same tactic of 
describing what plugins are, covering how to install them, giving 
examples of a few plugins and how they work.

This is a useful page to link to
http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins
It describes installing plugins with the built installer (with manual 
installation as a fall back) which seems like a more user friendly 
process than via ftp which is recommended in the current guide.

** Building readers

https://learn.wordpress.com/get-connected/

It might be nice to mirror this section in LWP but rewritten with some 
suggested tools like cross posting to twitter or a 'follow me' plugin.

** Understand the Code More / Advanced Admin

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide#Understand_the_Code_More
http://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/security/

Both FM and the quick guide have sections about taking it beyond the 
basics, analytics, upgrading, securing your installation. I guess the 
key here is to keep it brief and link to good beginner friendly pages on 
the codex.

I think the approach on the quick guide is good in terms of scope, 
modifying themes and understanding the loop. However, I think they need 
to lead the user by the hand a lot more and give some practical examples 
before sending new users off deep into the heart of the codex. I know 
Martin who has been working on the FM guide is up for doing some work in 
this area soon so I can keep you updated on this.

----//// end comments

I hope that these observations and suggestions are taken in the spirit 
of collaboration in which they are intended.  I am very happy that there 
is going to be an updated guide.

I only have sporadic access to good Internet and so I tend to sprint on 
these kinds of projects which is not ideal sometimes, as all the 
suggestions come at once. I am happy to take on some work transferring 
some / any of content to the codex if I am given some guidance on where 
to put it.

nice one
Mick

I guess this a good time to introduce myself too. I've been in contact with
Lorelle over the past week, and have started out with a guide to common
WordPress errors, and am planning a complete overhaul of the theme docs.

Looking forward to contributing more in the future :)

Let's welcome Siobhan, too, to the group. I work with a lot of people
behind the scenes on the Codex and while I say jump in and introduce
yourself on the Codex Mailing List, not all get around to it. :D

As I explain to many, the key way to first get involved in the Codex
(besides entering the Community Portal link on the Codex sidebar and
digging into the styles and guidelines) is to edit. Exactly that. Start
going through whatever articles interest you and look for spelling and
grammar mistakes. Remove all personal stories and ensure the documents are
in second person familiar. Check resource links to ensure they meet our
requirements and continue to serve as pertinent reference material.

Along the way you will usually stumble on an article in desperate need of
updating. This way, you get a feel for what's in the Codex and how all the
wiki bits work. It takes a bit of work to get into the Codex voice and
style. If you find something that worries you or needs an answer, check in
with me or with the group and we'll help. There is a lot of history here
and a lot of the other groups within WordPress sensitive about who is
touching their docs, so there is a lot to learn here. And it's all about
the team work here.

We have an amazing team that sit on the Codex constantly to ensure it is
clean and free of spam and unwanted crap. No article really belongs to any
single author (though some are protected as they tie in with WordPress
core) and we work collaboratively a lot. Many times people will put an
article up in their username space and invite us to attack with our red
pens and fix. We have dozens of volunteers that never chat on the Codex
discussion list but dig deep into the Codex whenever there is a need. It's
an amazing, versatile, and flexible group with a ton of self-starters.

So welcome and dig right in.

And thanks so much for all the time you give.

Lorelle

Great input, however, Learn WordPress has its short and cute presentations
geared towards their audience and the goals of the Codex is not to emulate
but to expand, go into more detail that helps people understand more on how
things work rather than just the basic button pushing. The WordPress
Lessons section is where the short and concise information goes in the
Codex.

The Quick Start Guide was probably not a good one to start with as that
document was marked for editing, expansion, or removal and has been on my
removal list for a long time. In fact, I thought I had. I'll take another
look at that. Thanks for pointing it out.

You make some very good points. Could you please select one to start with
and write it up according to the guidelines in your username space and
let's talk about it.

Thanks,

Lorelle

Subject: [wp-docs] Identifying and Labeling Core Documents
Message-ID: <CAN2v4ZRcNw67vbet6p0Fh-xvWSqYBUXpvA4soKkJnsM-yX+c3w@mail.gmail.com>

There are documents in the Codex tied directly to the WordPress core help
files and other core documentation. While they don't have a name, some of
us have been calling these "core documents."

There are some of these which are "protected," unable to be edited by just
anyone, and others which maybe should be protected but are not.

I'd like to create a category to identify these documents and group them
together, maybe "core" or something more descriptive. I'd also like to have
them feature a template note that describes them as part of the core, thus
should not be edited unless "approved" or by a "senior" editor. Something
that protects them from massive editing - which they may need but the
editing might break the "core" responsibilities of the documentation.

Suggestions?

Lorelle

Hi everyone,

For the 3.4 release, we've spent a significant amount of effort improving and bugfixing the XML-RPC functionality in core. This includes sixteen new XML-RPC methods and over 120 new unit tests.

Alongside the code changes, I've been working on documenting all of the new functionality and retroactively documenting the existing functionality.

There are two existing codex pages : [1] is the landing page; [2] only covers some of the methods, and is perpetually out-of-date.

You can find a suite of new pages on my userpage [3], including a replacement for [1] which links into the rest of the pages.

I'd appreciate feedback on the new pages, and would like to work with the right people on getting these migrated to the proper Codex (hopefully before 3.4 release). I've done my best to make sure the technical details are correct, but need some guidance on Codex best-practices and replacing the current pages.

Best,
Max Cutler

There already is a category. I made sure every document that was linked to the codec from 3.3 was tagged to it. I had created a different one before I was pointed to the existing one.

them feature a template note that describes them as part of the core, thus
should not be edited unless "approved" or by a "senior" editor. Something
that protects them from massive editing - which they may need but the
editing might break the "core" responsibilities of the documentation. 

 

Suggestions?

<< 

 

 

 

There's this category:  http://codex.wordpress.org/Category:UI_Link

 

If I remember correctly, documents are protected mainly to ward off people
defacing articles.  See http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:ProtectedPages

 

Otherwise, I haven't seen too many situations where documents have been
rendered inadequate from typical edits.

 

Regards.

This page is about WordPress & eCommerce but focuses only on the WP
eCommerce plugin and how to set it up

http://codex.wordpress.org/Business_Blogging_and_Shopping

Should this incorporate other free eCommerce plugins like Jigoshop? Or
should it just be made into a totally generic eCommerce page with just a
list of eCommerce plugins?

Also, as a more general question: is this sort of page which focuses on one
plugin appropriate in the Codex?

I agree.  I also think that the Codex format doesn't easily lend to such 
senior editor type moderation.  Realistically, this sort of thing is 
achieved by people undoing or rolling back poor quality edits.

I don't personally think that is an appropriate page to have on the Codex.

This was a user article that was supposed to be placed on the username
space for development and they dumped it right in and never finished it.
The idea of the article was to flesh out possibilities with ecommerce
features and had grandiose ideas about featuring conditional tags to
showcase items by category, etc., which is still a great idea of examples
but it was never finished. If the use of queries, conditionals, custom Page
Types, etc., could be shown how to be used as the default functionality and
not necessarily a Plugin, that would be cool.

Please note that the Codex team decided that when the WordPress Plugin
Directory became stable to remove all WordPress Plugin "brag" pages and
listings. As a rule, we do not support nor encourage any WordPress Theme or
Plugin except those that "come in the box." We'll reference some as
optional but not as the sole purpose of the article.

Good catch. Thanks!

Ah, forgot about the UI Link category. It's just so easy to miss.

@Jane, the articles in there are the ones.

If it's working, we just keep plowing forward, but let's remember to go
through and put all of them into that category so we don't boo boo with
changes or edits. It's happened but luckily we have the best and most
watchful team around!

Thanks,

I'm not the expert on XML-RPC but I'll give it a look over. Thanks so much
for your work. When ready, let me or MichaelH (or the docs mailing list)
know and we'll get it moved over. What an amazing amount of work. Thank you!

I've reverted those changes. Unforunately I can't tell if there is a
Chinese version of the get_header() page which can be linked to from
the English page.

I've moved this to the original author's namespace for further 'flesh out'.

Went through them and they look fabulous. Changed the royal "we" to
WordPress to match Codex voice and style, but that's minor.

@MichaelH or anyone want to go through and make sure all the pages link to
each other and they are categorized properly?  There is an API category
which this will fit perfectly in.

Max, this is fabulous. I've been desperate to get all of the API stuff
totally fleshed out on the Codex and you've set a new gold standard! Thanks!

There should be a redirect in place.  I didn't remove the links from the
Advanced Topics or WordPress Lessons articles.

Excellent. Did you check any links to it? I know you did, but thought I'd
use that as a lesson. :D

This was a user article that was supposed to be placed on the username space
for development and they dumped it right in and never finished it. The idea
of the article was to flesh out possibilities with ecommerce features and
had grandiose ideas about featuring conditional tags to showcase items by
category, etc., which is still a great idea of examples but it was never
finished. If the use of queries, conditionals, custom Page Types, etc.,
could be shown how to be used as the default functionality and not
necessarily a Plugin, that would be cool. 

Please note that the Codex team decided that when the WordPress Plugin
Directory became stable to remove all WordPress Plugin "brag" pages and
listings. As a rule, we do not support nor encourage any WordPress Theme or
Plugin except those that "come in the box." We'll reference some as optional
but not as the sole purpose of the article.

Good catch. Thanks!

Should this incorporate other free eCommerce plugins like Jigoshop? Or
should it just be made into a totally generic eCommerce page with just a
list of eCommerce plugins?

 

Also, as a more general question: is this sort of page which focuses on one
plugin appropriate in the Codex?

Thanks for adding the intro for me, Lorelle. I went in today to follow up,
and saw that you beat me by just a couple days. ;)

LOL! Do I win something? :D

Please fix it up with the information I missed or whatever. I just grabbed
what I could find to help flesh it out to help people understand what the
page was about.

Let's get them out of there. You have permissions to edit those pages,
right? Can't remember how locked down they are from spammers.

Done.

 

Just to reiterate, there are just five "regular" articles in Codex that are
protected.those are:

Main Page

Permalink Structure

Upgrading

Update Services

WordPress in Your Language

Let's get them out of there. You have permissions to edit those pages,
right? Can't remember how locked down they are from spammers.

Excellent. Did you check any links to it? I know you did, but thought I'd

This was a user article that was supposed to be placed on the username space
for development and they dumped it right in and never finished it. The idea
of the article was to flesh out possibilities with ecommerce features and
had grandiose ideas about featuring conditional tags to showcase items by
category, etc., which is still a great idea of examples but it was never
finished. If the use of queries, conditionals, custom Page Types, etc.,
could be shown how to be used as the default functionality and not
necessarily a Plugin, that would be cool. 

Please note that the Codex team decided that when the WordPress Plugin
Directory became stable to remove all WordPress Plugin "brag" pages and
listings. As a rule, we do not support nor encourage any WordPress Theme or
Plugin except those that "come in the box." We'll reference some as optional
but not as the sole purpose of the article.

Good catch. Thanks!

Should this incorporate other free eCommerce plugins like Jigoshop? Or
should it just be made into a totally generic eCommerce page with just a
list of eCommerce plugins?

 

Also, as a more general question: is this sort of page which focuses on one
plugin appropriate in the Codex?

Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress 3.4 docs
Message-ID: <CAN2v4ZQAQB2kLT1AAN6fWugoeVdDx+J_P-iQuOocbjz72HFYnA@mail.gmail.com>

This is a first look at the new features in WordPress 3.4. It's move fast
time, team!  Do we have documents on the Codex to back up the new features?

* Theme Customizer with Previewer
* Flexible Custom Header Sizes
*Selecting Custom Header and Background Images from Media Library
* Better experience searching for and choosing a theme
* New API for registering theme support for custom headers and backgrounds
* Performance improvements to WP_Query by splitting the query
* Internationalization improvements (improved performance and locale
support)
* Performance and API improvements when working with lists of installed
themes
* Support for installing child themes from the WordPress Themes Directory

Max, are we ready to move your XML-RPC API stuff to the main docs?

What are we missing or what needs beefing up? Remember, we have a to do
list at http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/ and I'll be adding these here if
we turn up stuff without docs.

Are you ready? GO! :D

Note that add_custom_background(), add_custom_header_image(), and
add_theme_support() will all need to be updated as well, due to the
deprecation of the former two, and the expanded role of the latter.

Good to know. Interesting that more aren't protected. That says a LOT for
our team's ability (especially you, Michael) to stay on top of spam and
yuk. Excellent.

Thanks,

We have a to do list http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/ and anyone can jump
in and take responsibility for whatever. If you monitor the
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:RecentChanges pages, you can see when
someone's started a document on a subject recently.

We rarely have that problem. That's why we've wanted an official P2 site
and made do with our little task list site.

So shout. What do you want?

I'm ready to move the XML-RPC stuff into the main docs whenever you are. Just let me know what work you want/need from my end.

Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress 3.4 docs

This is a first look at the new features in WordPress 3.4. It's move fast time, team!  Do we have documents on the Codex to back up the new features?

* Theme Customizer with Previewer
* Flexible Custom Header Sizes
*Selecting Custom Header and Background Images from Media Library
* Better experience searching for and choosing a theme
* New API for registering theme support for custom headers and backgrounds
* Performance improvements to WP_Query by splitting the query
* Internationalization improvements (improved performance and locale support)
* Performance and API improvements when working with lists of installed themes
* Support for installing child themes from the WordPress Themes Directory

Max, are we ready to move your XML-RPC API stuff to the main docs?

What are we missing or what needs beefing up? Remember, we have a to do list at http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/ and I'll be adding these here if we turn up stuff without docs.

Are you ready? GO! :D

Lorelle

Just let me know what work you want/need from my end.

<< 

 

Great work Max.  Which articles do you want moved and where do you want them
moved?

 

I'm guessing you want these articles moved from your user namespace into the
main namespace:

User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC WordPress API moved to XML-RPC WordPress API

User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC Blogger API moved to XML-RPC Blogger API

User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC MetaWeblog API moved to XML-RPC MetaWeblog API

User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC MovableType API moved to XML-RPC MovableType API

User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC Pingback API moved to XML-RPC Pingback API

User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC Extending moved to XML-RPC Extending

 

If you are replacing an existing article you can just edit that article and
paste in the new text.

 

Let me know, and again, thanks for contributing to Codex.

 

MichaelH

pre-release period. :)

That's correct MichaelH, those pages (and the subpages within the WordPress API one) need to get moved into the main namespace.

User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC_Support is a replacement for an existing page, and User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC_WordPress_API could replace the existing XMLRPC _wp page.

Great work Max.  Which articles do you want moved and where do you want them moved?

I'm guessing you want these articles moved from your user namespace into the main namespace:
User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC WordPress API moved to XML-RPC WordPress API
User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC Blogger API moved to XML-RPC Blogger API
User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC MetaWeblog API moved to XML-RPC MetaWeblog API
User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC MovableType API moved to XML-RPC MovableType API
User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC Pingback API moved to XML-RPC Pingback API
User:Maxcutler/XML-RPC Extending moved to XML-RPC Extending

If you are replacing an existing article you can just edit that article and paste in the new text.

Let me know, and again, thanks for contributing to Codex.

Probably a better question for the Docs mail-list. It would probably be
beneficial to have a Theme Tags Codex entry that corresponds to the
discrete list of allowable Theme tags, describing each one.

Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress-Generated CSS Classes for Menus
Message-ID: <CAPdLKqc+m6vWL05ga5esYamrqaSriMFQE8dmjPGv=CZuYC6tGA@mail.gmail.com>

So, in trying to answer a question for someone regarding the CSS classes
that WordPress generates for menu items, I realized that none of the
following entries actually lists or explains those classes:

   - wp_nav_menu() Func
Ref<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu>
   - wp_page_menu() Func
Ref<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_page_menu>
   - wp_list_pages() Func
Ref<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_list_pages>
   - WordPress Menu User
Guide<http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Menu_User_Guide>
   - Navigation Menus <http://codex.wordpress.org/Navigation_Menus>


I think this information would be a useful addition, but am looking for
some feedback/guidance before proceeding: where would be the best place for
this information? I'm thinking that the function references would be ideal?
I note that wp_list_pages() does include a couple of the classes, under the
"Markup and Style of Page Items" section. Should I follow this model for
all three function reference pages?

Thanks,

Chip

+1 for the function reference page. Another example is 
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/body_class>

I could also see this being a useful WordPress Lesson.  Perhaps this come after a more technical write up for the codex?  I am happy to help with it.

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Menu_User_Guide needs desperate
updating and compliance with Codex styles, so I would use this for the
WordPress Lesson article. Just update it. It's a good introduction.

Add to the list:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Dynamic_Menu_Highlighting
http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Horizontal_Menus

All long past due needing updates or merging.

If we had two solid articles, one for beginners and another for
intermediate to advanced users, and they link to all the appropriate
supporting functions and template tags, would that be enough? Can we get
rid of the two above or consolidate things, or do we need more?

Siobhan McKeown is working on
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Raggedrobins/Common_WordPress_Errors and
needs screenshots of:

Failed auto-upgrade message
Connection timed out message

Got some?

The article is also ready for a review. The goal of the article is to
create a document that summaries the most common WordPress errors.
Currently they are scattered all over the place, buried in FAQ and
elsewhere. It's a great focus point article that will help support forum
folks, too.

I think Chip's orginal idea of adding the generated CSS to the function reference is a fantatic idea.

I will update the Menu User Guide to be WordPress Lesson.

Consolidating these other two articles into one that covers intermediate/advanced users and then links through to the function references can go on my to do list as well.  After a quick search through the codex, I didn't see anything else to consolidate.

Will this work for revision of the "WordPress Menu User Guide?"

I was unsure of the protocol for editing existing entries, so I put this on my user page for the time being.

Here's a stab at a first draft:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu#Menu_Item_CSS_Classes

Let me know what you think. If this one is okay, I'll use the same format
for wp_page_menu() and wp_list_pages().

Thanks,

Chip

It looks fabulous.

Make sure, when ready, that there are jump links to that section from
within the article, especially in the examples and mentions of the menu
classes.

Also, we usually do the "code" headings in <tt> code. I could go either way
with these but that's the consistent look and feel.

Well done! Thank you!

I just did a quick read-through, and nothing jumped out at me as being
appropriate as a "jump" link to the section. Of course, that probably
implies that some of the descriptive text could use updating as well, if
none of it makes mention of the function applying contextual CSS classes to
the menu list items. :)

I found and wrapped wp_page_menu() in <tt> tags in one subheading. I didn't
see any others; did I miss any?

Thanks,

Chip

Chip, that's awesome stuff, and a very valuable reference for beginners.
With that in mind, I think it would be very beneficial to provide some
little CSS examples to illustrate common use cases, for instance:

- how to highlight the menu item of the current page that you're on
- how to highlight the parent of the current menu item, when in a pull-down
(hierarchical) context
- how to colour menu items differently depending on post type

Tom,

I'm conflicted regarding adding basic CSS/HTML markup examples to the
Codex. Once one knows the classes that are applied to the HTML LI tags,
using those tags for CSS styling should be fairly trivial. Do we do this
elsewhere in the Codex?

If need be, we can add examples from Twenty Eleven's style.css...

Chip

I think both of you raise good points.

Could we leave's Chips references as is and then use a WordPress Lesson to show examples of the generated html and some use cases?  That way, the page that Chip updated won't get too cluttered and we can provide a little more information for beginners who might need it.

Would that work?

There are 2 functions that I know of that have already been marked as
deprecated, even though that won't actually happen until the release of 3.4

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_custom_background
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_custom_image_header

Similarly, the page for add_theme_support() implies it's ready to replace
those 2 functions
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_theme_support

It's not until you look at the change log at the bottom of those pages that
you can see that some of this will only be applicable in the next release.

I wanted to add some clarification on those pages, but I wanted to check
and see if there were already rules/guidelines in place for this.

There are 2 functions that I know of that have already been marked as deprecated, even though that won't actually happen until the release of 3.4

 

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_custom_background

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_custom_image_header

 

Similarly, the page for add_theme_support() implies it's ready to replace those 2 functions

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_theme_support

 

It's not until you look at the change log at the bottom of those pages that you can see that some of this will only be applicable in the next release.

 

I wanted to add some clarification on those pages, but I wanted to check and see if there were already rules/guidelines in place for this.

<<<< 

 

No real guidelines, that I know of, but if you want, put a note at the top of the page that the articles are in transition to meet 3.4 core.  Please remember to remove that after 3.4 comes out next month.

 

Thanks.

Thanks,
I've added the clarification. Hopefully it will prevent people from making
the same mistake I did. Twice.

Wouldn't it be helpful if those Deprecation notices listed the version in
which the function was deprecated? That would eliminate the confusion AND
provide useful information.

+1 for this, as sometimes there's a lag between the site you're working on
and when they upgrade.

Hey Chip, in order to better understand your position, I think I'll need
some clarification on why you don't want some very small examples of the CSS
(you wouldn't need any HTML, since the markup is auto generated by the very
functions you're documenting). Obviously we do PHP examples all over the
place, why should it be different for CSS when it's apposite to the topic at
hand?

Just some anecdotal experience here: I have recently hired two new web
developers, rather fresh out of school, and to them it was quite a mystery
as to how to highlight selected menu items etc. Of the two, I think one
could have figured it out given a list of all the classes available, but the
other who was a more visual learner, really needed to be shown once how all
those classes could be leveraged.

Just in terms of making the documentation as complete as possible, and as
useful as possible to all viewers of various experience levels, I thought it
might be handy to just give a hint or two of how these classes might be
leveraged in a real-world scenario.

I do like Evan's suggestion of using examples from the official themes that
ship with WP. That seems right to me. I guess the only issue there is what
do we do when Twenty-Twelve ships (looking like 3.5 at the moment, so still
a few months off)?

Tom,

I'm conflicted regarding adding basic CSS/HTML markup examples to the
Codex. Once one knows the classes that are applied to the HTML LI tags,
using those tags for CSS styling should be fairly trivial. Do we do this
elsewhere in the Codex?

If need be, we can add examples from Twenty Eleven's style.css...

Tom,

I suppose my thinking is that it is essentially redundant to say, "The
following classes are applied to menu items, i.e. to the HTML <li> tags,
generated by wp_nav_menu():", then to list out those classes by context
(for example, the .current-menu-item class description is, "This class is
added to menu items that correspond to the currently rendered page."), and
then to say, "to target the current page menu item, use .current-menu-item
{}". If I pull all of the related CSS definitions from Twenty Eleven
style.css, I think it will really over-clutter the CSS classes section,
without really providing much additional benefit.

Further, I guess I'm expecting that anyone looking for CSS classes applied
via wp_nav_menu() already has a basic understanding of CSS and HTML.
Perhaps that's not a valid assumption?

I really like Evan's suggestion to put CSS examples in the How-To/Tutorial
article for using custom nav menus. I think they'd be a better fit there,
since they can be given more/better context.

But if we want to go the route of putting the examples in the wp_nav_menu()
function ref, just let me know, and I'll start copy/pasting from Twenty
Eleven. :)

Message-ID: <CAMi+fEkSFEbZfOqxvRjaBnZEprMbkFmum+86W-ZKYvxf1adbQA@mail.gmail.com>

"Function runtime usage" is probably an overly technical name for what I'm
talking about. A lot of WP functions can only be used (or should be) after
specific hooks fire. Some examples include wp_enqueue_script and any
function defined in the admin/ folder.

The style for referencing this on the wp_enqueue_script Codex page is to
put it in bold text in the description. Perhaps there could be a more
standard subsection to look to for a comment regarding the runtime usage?
With a nicer name than function runtime usage.

LOL! The <tt> is not for headings. I meant in the class definition section
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu#All_Menu_ItemsWhen
defining "code" the code is usually in <tt> and the definition in
normal type.

Jump link points:

Targeting a specific Menu
Adding Conditional Classes to Menu Items
How to add a parent class for menu item

These could use jump links "for more information" to the classes section
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu#Menu_Item_CSS_Classesor
to a specific appropriate menu item class.

Unless someone is really paying attention, they won't know that all those
beautiful class definitions are down there. We need to lead them like horse
to water. :D

This is fabulous. We need more like this.

Hi all. 3.4 beta 3 comes out this morning, which means RC (and string 
freeze) is right around the corner. I'll be putting together the updated 
text for the About WordPress admin screen and was hoping I might find a 
volunteer or two to whip up some help tab patches this weekend to get 
the help tabs caught up with some of the new features. Off the top of my 
head, flex headers, the previewer/customizer, and html in captions need 
to be added (also to Codex). I have someone taking screenshots of these 
for the About screen, so those will be available for the Codex soon.

Shirley.

If we've got a list of the deprecated as well, like Trepmal mentioned earlier this week, we should probably hit them up. (I'm just happy I don't have to update the 'Where is my Network Admin Button NOW?' section. If it stays still through 3.5, I can turf that whole weird bit ;)

Hi Jane, as I mentioned a few weeks ago in Dev chat, I'd like to help with
this. I'm available for up to 4 hours this weekend, maybe a bit more. I can
start as early as tonight.

So, just so I'm clear about what you need, and since I'm still pretty new,
please confirm for me:

1. grab the latest beta from SVN (would that be "/trunk"?)
2. experiment with the new features (flex headers, theme previewer)
3. find the tickets on Trac that are relevant to those features, read up
4. find the relevant wp-admin files that create the pages for those features
and edit the Help tab text (and possibly the help sidebar text?)
5. create a patch file and upload it to the relevant ticket on Trac.

Does this sound right? If you had the ticket #'s that would probably
eliminate a lot of confusion, for me at least.

Tom

Jane,

Any thoughts on how you want to implement the help UI for the
Previewer/Customizer section? I haven't opened the code yet, but I don't
know whether any help UI has been implemented for the Previewer/Customizer,
since it's more or less full-screen.

Tom

New help tabs for the Themes section have been submitted in a patch to Trac
#20515 (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20515). I didn't know where to
attach them, so I just created a new ticket and copied Jane and Koop on it.
Minor revisions to existing tabs, some cosmetic code cleanup and then two
new tabs - one for the Manage Themes and one for the Install Themes page.

Logged a number of bug reports as well, while I was putting it through its
paces.

I hope I'm doing this right. If there's a better process, someone please
reach out and let me know!

Hi Tom,
 
In the past, we've done one omnibus ticket for all the help tabs. I don't  
know if that's preferred or not this time. Maybe a separate ticket for each  
section (Appearance, etc.)
 
One stylistic quibble: most of the help tabs do not use quote marks for  
words/phrases/actions that are in the interface. Just capitalize the first  
letter: Customize, not "Customize" -- cleaner, less visual noise. We do not 
yet  have a Style Guide for the tabs...
 
I'll comment on the ticket too, but thought people on this list might  want 
to weigh in as well.

I hear you, and I agree that we should normalize our approach to writing
style within the Help tabs.

As I explained on the ticket, however, I do feel strongly that the use of
quotes when describing a specific UI element actually helps to disambiguate
the interface element from the context in which it appears within the
sentence. 

Doug's example of "Customize" vs. Customize works, but consider some of the
other UI elements that I need to refer to in the tabs: "Choose from image
library" and "Set as header". Those links are in sentence case and I feel
it's stylistically and grammatically incorrect to omit the quote marks,
which both serve to visually group those items together and keep them
distinct from the sentence, as well as to make it obvious that that clause
is the object of the sentence.

Anyway, sorry for being so pedantic about this.  It's a best practice I've
been using for 15 years. I'm eager to hear others' opinions of the matter,
especially in the context of sentence case hyperlinks.

Tom
