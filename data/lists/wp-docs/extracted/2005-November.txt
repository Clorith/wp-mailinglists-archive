We've tried to do protecting before, but there was some problem with 
that. I hope this works.

Great work all.

[ cross-posted to all pertinent WP lists ]

We've selected Saturday, November 5 as the date for our WordPress Bug Hunt:
http://www.skippy.net/blog/2005/11/01/wordpress-bug-hunt-2005-11-05/

I'd appreciate it if someone could compose a quick forum post about
this, and also throw mention of it onto the Codex.  I tried, but decided
that I couldn't get the proper "tone" for such an announcement on the Codex.

Maybe just a page similar to the IRC Meetup page.

We can put a notice on the dev blog.

Hi All,

It seems we are heavily blessed by spammer(s) at the moment.

Would it not be a good idea, if possible, to remove the ability to Move 
pages from normal users?

This would reduce the amount of time taken to clear up these attacks - 
Page Moves take a lot more clearing up than malicous edits.

MichaelH put up something in the Current Events. I threw this  
together using the IRC Meetup page as a start:

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Schulte/WordPress_Bug_Hunts

Thieving a little from Scott and Owen...hope that was ok.

Feel free to edit it mercilessly and move it out to the masses. Is it  
safe to assume that Bug Hunts might happen with some sort of frequency?

We've bit hit again twice today!

It looks like we can't remove move priviledges easily unless we go to
MediaWiki 1.5.

However you can Protect pages just from Move's which is what I have done
to some of the most recently hit ones.

If anyone has any trouble with pages that I have protected or needs any
help drop me a message on my Talk page or via email.

I'm at work atm and will check again in a few hours

I tweaked it a bit; I'll let this simmer through the morning, to allow 
for any additional edits anyone might feel are appropriate.  Around 
lunchtime EDT I plan to move this to a new page.

Do you think it would be beneficial to point at XAMPP?  There are people 
who might be willing to help test but don't have the slightest clue how 
to set up a server locally.  It might be worthwhile to have a document 
explaining how to set up a local staging install of WP.

Heck, this should be part of the regular documentation, really.

My only question is whether this is the barrier to entry: "If you can't 
set up your own local Apache, thanks, but we're looking for someone more 
qualified."  Personally, I think that bug reporting from tyros is a good 
thing, since only having developers/insiders looking at things tends to 
leave holes.  If the barrier to entry is the ability to follow the XAMPP 
installation instructions, we might get more reports from a novice user 
perspective - a good thing.

And how did I get on the host list?  Not a problem, but someone might 
have told me if I have such obligations.  Are you guys going to code and 
manage incoming folks?  At what time is this business going to start?  I 
will likely be online Saturday AM EST.

Owen

I agree that we should encourage as many people as possible to
participate, which is why I've been specifically making it a point to
say that PHP experience is not a requirement.

Even if one can't install XAMPP, one can likely install a fresh 1.6 copy
into a sub-directory of their main site, using a different table prefix.

Speaking of which, we should probably provide a tarball snapshot of SVN,
so that someone can download that without having to muck around with SVN
first.  I'll make the snapshot Saturday, and host it through the day.

You were there when I went to edit, and I left you there.  =)  There's
no obligation, and no hard feelings if you'd prefer to have your name
removed.  I completely understand if you'd prefer to focus on coding.

My current plan is this: find out what a participant is capable of, and
what they want to do.  For those who have no coding experience, assign
to them the open bugs with patches that need testing.  For those with
PHP experience, we'll need to discern their skill level and assign
unpatched bugs as appropriate.

I'd like to work linearly through the bug list, taking out the old stuff
first, and working forward.  Hopefully you uber-coders will be
generating patches for the non-coders to test, so we should be able to
work in conjunction with one another at a reasonable pace.

I'm currently planning on being ready around 10 AM EDT.

Owen,

I added you. Incorrectly, it seems. My apologies. I inferred that you  
might be one from the tone of your post: http://asymptomatic.net/ 
2005/11/01/2077/wordpress-bug-hunt-this-saturday/

Want me to remove you as a host from the document?

How heavily has the 1.5 => 1.6  upgrade been done? I'm in the middle of 
something else at the moment, but I do have the resources to test the 
upgrade path. My current XAMP setup has me on MySQL 4 and PHP4, which 
can be easily switched to PHP5 as well. I could devote sometime this 
weekend giving that a shakedown.

It's redone and I've put more emphasis on the installation with more
screenshots. If you think it could be improved to help for the bug hunt,
don't be shy :)

Awesome, sign me up! I've got a hockey game to play but should be
available around that.

1. Can we get dev blog publicity for this?
2. Any reason we're starting so late as 3pm when we could just declare
the whole day to be a bug hunt?
3. What happened to the whole-weekend bug hunt proposed in last week's meetup?

Ryan mentioned the devblog, so I assumed he'd post about it.  Someone
should do it.

I'm planning on starting around 10 AM EDT.  Any folks closer to UTC
should feel free to hop in #wordpress-bugs to get the party started sooner!

Dunno.  I heard rumor that a bug hunt was being planned, and I grabbed
the reins.  If folks want to keep it up through Sunday, I think that's
great!  I won't be able to participate as much, but I can probably pop
in to help for a bit.

I'll do a post after today's meetup.   Can we get the Codex page moved
into place after the meetup so I can point at it?

For the record...

I've been clicking on my wp-docs folder every day for the past week, and 
no messages have come through.  I got 40+ this morning, including this 
one, so my lack of response on this matter is just a technical issue.

I'll surely help out however I can, listed or not.  :)

Apparently it's been posted twice :

and

Sysop attention requested:

Trying to figure out why the Featured Article at the bottom of the Main Page
of codex shows as a broken link.  When you click on the link you get thrown
into the edit of featured article for week 46.   The link (and template
rendering) shows fine on a old copy of the main page I save two weeks ago
at : http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MichaelH/Sandbox

Can only think problem has to do with Main Page now being protected.  Could
a sysop unprotect, edit, save, and re-protect the Main Page
http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page  to see if link and template render
correctly.

Thanks for the help.

Okay, false alarm caused by user error.  I recently change several of my
Preferences, and one of them was the Rendering math.  Changed that to
"Recommended for modern browser" and the problem went away.

I've resurrected it, and have started updating all the files.
I'm encouraging hotlinking to the actual files and for others to

And I'm debating placing them into Googlebase.
Thoughts ?

1) How are you converting them? Is this something you need help with as

2) I've got a bit of space & bandwidth I'm willing to use to act as a

You do realize that Google Base will maintain content for only 30 days,
right?

Using Openoffice 2 again (~90meg download itself)

All the original .odt files I used are here:
http://www.zen77857.zen.co.uk/zips/odt-files.zip
so I've grabbed and unzipped

I'm going through the .odt files and then using the page History in
Codex to see when/what has changed. Re-edit the .odt, save then export
as the PDF. The list here:
http://www.zen77857.zen.co.uk/docs/ shows last modified date and I'm
going in alpha order.

It's boring more than technical, and though it would be good to offer
the docs in other formats I have no idea how to do this smoothly.

The easiest way to help would be to claim a letter (T is horrible - all
those Template_tags !) then we don't overlap too much.

I'm okay for space and bandwidth on that site (a gig / unlimited) but
it's more a case of people being able to grab if they want. While I
doubt my domain would be blocked, the more sites that host and say so
the more chance someone will find that from a search. I'd happily list
mirrors to help though ?

Thanks - I didn't (but I never RTFM :) )
Hmm .. my thoughts were that it would help make things easier to find
therefore get people to use Codex, use WP ....
Uploading the lot every month could be a hassle.
Ponder, ponder

No apologies needed :)

There are a number of ways to turn the Codex pages into pdf files. There
is (was ?) some code that could put a 'PDF this' onto each page IIRC.
Equally, users can print out the codex too.

The problem with using a blind script is that is literally prints
everything it sees. That would include all the TOC (table of contents),
all the [edit] links, all the [return to ...] links and the graphics
would look even worse. I'm sure someone could code around that - but
no-one has.

So as ugly as some may feel they are, I cannot see an alternative way to
produce the content. At least not freely.

I'm guessing you're referring to 
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/HTML2FPDF_and_Mediawiki which I found 
this morning after this was brought up.

Exactly - I'm no coder, but I know enough to know that it's *possible* 
to make this process easier. I guess until we can coax someone into 
coding it, we're stuck with the current way.

Thanks Podz for taking the initiative - this is no doubt helping a lot 
of folks.
