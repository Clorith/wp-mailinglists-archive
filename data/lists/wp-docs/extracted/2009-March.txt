Subject: [wp-docs] File naming problem for the __() function
Message-ID: <49AA12E3.9000200@htcomp.net>

Hello All,

I took the liberty to name the __ function page _2 since Mediawiki 
apparently squashes multiple underscores. I doubt most people will 
notice it, but I placed a note above the page Description heading giving 
a brief explanation of the error.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/_2

I tried using __ and __function as well but Mediawiki didn't like those.

Could someone more learned see if there is a better solution?

Perhaps it might be possible to create a redirect from 
/Function_Reference/__ to Function_Reference/_2 to get around Mediawiki.

I didn't test to see if this is an Apache limitation to the file name.


HTH,

Message-ID: <49AB50A1.9060705@santosj.name>

There has been some confusion on Trac about the purpose and use case 
about the Delete Plugin and plugin authors wanting to be able to keep 
their settings.

The reason the plugin uninstall is part of the plugin delete is so that 
plugin authors can clean up their settings when the user deletes their 
plugin. I think the confusion lies is when the person realizes that they 
didn't want to remove their plugin and find that all of their settings 
are now gone. This should not be the case and should be assumed that 
when the user deletes the plugin, that they also want to remove any and 
all settings, files, and misc stuff that would be considered garbage 
once the plugin is no more.

I'm not sure where to put this on the Codex, so I'm letting you all here 
know in case there is an inquiry in the future or if someone knows of a 
place it should be. I'm not sure there is actually any page other than 
the Version 2.7 notes on the uninstall. It would be nice if there was.

Subject: [wp-docs] Function Pages Update
Message-ID: <49AB7A7E.4010209@htcomp.net>

Hello,

New Function Reference Pages

I have added about 249 new function reference pages to the Codex since 
taking on the project in mid-December. I'm really surprised I'm not 
burned out. I completed this first goal a few moments ago.

All the function links listed on the Function Reference page[1] go 
somewhere now. The new pages are just the description from the inline 
docs plus a few extra comments and linked terms, but it is a good start.

I seriously doubt all the functions in WordPress on listed on that page, 
but I need to take a breather before deciding the next step and I would 
like to get the Global Variable page on the Codex before continuing.

I didn't touch any of the existing function pages. Many of them are in 
pretty bad shape, but the first goal was to get something on each page 
for now. We still need examples. I think we will always need more examples.

I didn't get to the Class descriptions (yet).



Inline Docs Parser

The parser I wrote to rip apart the source code is getting better. It 
doesn't understand PHP code, but it can handle the function definition 
and the global() statement to construct default values and to add 
descriptive global variable names (some with links to Codex pages).

There is a term parser which automatically generates external links to 
Wikipedia (for some common terms like HTML and Nonce) and to the PHP 
manual for PHP terms and functions. There are also many links to Codex 
pages including a linker to other codex functions listed in the function 
docs.

I had a few requests to re-write it in PHP (it's in perl now) so WP 
programmers could play. I thought I would try starting from the XRef 
code base, but it is also written in perl. Go figure. :)

Thanks, Jacob.

The information about this should go in two places. First, as an advisory to
those using WordPress Plugins as a warning to not uninstall the Plugin
unless they really want to remove all settings and database information.
That goes in the Managing Plugins article.

The other needs to go into the Plugin development area, at first on how to
write a WordPress Plugin, and possibly elsewhere. The functions and such
need to be in the WordPress Functions pages as well. Part of the development
documentation.

Can you add it or do you want me to? I can add it to the Managing Plugins
article, but your development expertise would be better for the other areas.

Thank you. This is an invaluable catch.

Hi,

I'm a system admin of Japanese Codex. Our Codex pages have
links to English and other languages, like Wikipedia's sidebar [1].
(e.g. Japanese "Template Tags" page [2])

Similarly, will you consider adding such sidebar links to English
Codex using "Interlanguage Links" function of Mediawiki? [3]

You need to add a new row (see below) into the interwiki table[4]
for English Codex database.
Who should I talk with about this? (system admin of Codex?)

iw_prefix | iw_url                                             |iw_local | iw_trans
----------+------------------------------------+---------+----------
ja             | http://wpdocs.sourceforge.jp/$1 | 1           | 0

If English Codex skin doesn't have "otherlanguages" section, like
ones in skins/MonoBook.php file, it might also need to add this
section.

Thank you!

Isn't there an official place for other-language Codex documentation? 
If not, maybe there should be?

Being a user of the french Codex, I asked the same question long ago
(or rather, "can we have inter-language links in the manner of
wikipedia?"), and I remember the answer being "no can do, because of
the way the codex is currently setup".
Hopefully this can now be done...

Thanks, Jennifer, Xavier!

"Interlanguage Links" is the basic function of MediaWiki.
We can use this function, simply doing below.

1. Add data[1] to interwiki table of English Codex database.
2. Add languageBox to Codex skin file, if it's not already available.
3. Start adding links to each page.

But French Codex will need to change the format of existing internal
links, from [[fr:Page name]] to [[:fr:Page name]]. [2]
You could add a colon to each link on wiki by hand, or export French
pages[3], run a search & replace, then import.

I'm totally in favor, and have been, of linking the various languages
together, manually or otherwise. The links to the international versions are
at the bottom of the main page, and I thought they were at the bottom of
every page. Huh. Wonder if that got lost in the changes a couple years ago.
I'll look into that.

I would love to also have manual links to translated articles. If someone
translates a page, they should also add a link to that translated article in
the Codex on the page they translate, as well as to the original English (or
whatever language) so we can build cross linking context to all the
articles.

However, I don't read Japanese, Turkish, Russian, etc., so I can't go
through and do this. Nor would I expect anyone else not versed in the
language to do so. We need to get the translators to do this as part of
their responsibilities, helping everyone find the information they need in
their language.

I'll post to the polygots group to ask their help in this, too. Thanks for
bringing it up.

I've posted a note to the wp-polyglots mailing list and here is the core
info we need to know.

1. I'm contacting the PTB for WordPress to get the translation bar added to
the footer of the Codex. This will only direct people to the front page of
the translation version, but it's a start. No matter what page they land
upon, they will be able to get to something in their language.

2. I've added translating information to the Codex and asked the
wp-polyglots mailing list folks to cross link between the original documents
and the translated, and vise versa to get the connection between the
languages. I've also set up a guideline for adding translation links:


http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Creating_a_New_Page#Translating_the_WordPress_Codex

I've also added the link to this in the Contributing to WordPress page. I'm
awaiting your feedback and then I'll blog about this and hope that others
will do the same if their audience serves this issue to help spread the
word.

Thanks for kicking us in the butt about this. We started work on something
along this line a long time ago but it's been lost in the workload. :D

The easiest way to update French docs is to have the Codex admin
replace them with SQL statements.


Thanks Lorelle,

I've always wanted to see cross links to translated articles in Codex,
so this is a huge step forward!

Let me clarify some things.
The "Interlanguage Links" I was talking about is also a way to
"manually" select articles that you link to.
Once the database's interwiki table is set up, contributors can use a
translated page's article name to link to it.

For example, you'll add some code like this on an English page:

[[fr:French Article Name]]
[[ja:Japanese Articke Name]]
[[tr:Turkish Article Name]]
[[zh:Chinese Article Name]]
[[zh-tw:???? Article Name]]

The advantages of this over adding links within the article (with
full path to other articles) are:

- No need to write full path, just article names (similar to linking
within the same wiki)
- Translated article links will show up on the sidebar. A lot of
people are used to Wikipedia's such interface, so it will be easier
to find translation
- If the domain is changed for a translated documentation, there is
no need to edit each page; Codex admin just need to update the
interwiki table in the database. I'd like to have
ja.codex.wordpress.org domain assigned to our sorceforge hosted
documentation if possible, so this eliminates extra work in the
future.

Like I said in my earlier post, this change requires database change
& skin modificaiton.
I'd really like to be in touch with whoever in charge of making such
update so I can explain the process and maybe answer any questions.
