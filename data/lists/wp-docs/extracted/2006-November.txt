Subject: [wp-docs] Codex down; is there a better support address?
Message-ID: <4550B3FF.2020902@jpeek.com>

Yesterday I was getting "500 Internal Server Error" pages from 
codex.wordpress.org.  Today some of the pages are there; others time out 
with errors like these:

Looking up codex.wordpress.org
Making HTTP connection to codex.wordpress.org
Sending HTTP request.
HTTP request sent; waiting for response.
Alert!: Unexpected network read error; connection aborted.
Can't Access `http://codex.wordpress.org/About_WordPress'
Alert!: Unable to access document.

I tried several different browsers on two computers in different parts 
of the US, so I think it's not my problem.  Can someone here check on it?

Thanks,
Jerry

P.S. Sorry to send this to a Forum (where my message will be archived 
and sent to everyone on the list).  I can't access the page 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Listadmins to find the admins' User 
Talk pages, and I couldn't find any other support address -- except a 
whois lookup for the domain wordpress.org, and I already emailed Matt 
Mullenweg yesterday about the "500" errors..

Subject: [wp-docs] Narrow center column makes Codex pages long
Message-ID: <4550AF4A.1070909@jpeek.com>

I'm a new WordPress user.  The Codex is a big help.  But the layout (on 
Firefox under Linux, at least) could be better, I think.  On the Main 
Page, for instance, I get a very long center column that goes on for 
screen after screen.  After the top screen, there's lots of whitespace 
at the left and right sides of this long/narrow column.  I'll attach a 
screen shot of my second screen of ten.

Have we considered using a different design/theme -- at least for the 
Main Page?  For instance, move all of the overall navigation links from 
the columns to fill the entire top of the page... and let all of the 
other Codex pages appear below the top.  That would make much better use 
of the remaining space in the page.  As it is, having navigation at the 
left and right of the first screen doesn't help people navigate when 
they're on screens below; they still have to scroll back to the top to 
reach the overall navigation links.  Using columns like these only makes 
sense, I think, when the body content of the page is short.

Jerry

P.S. That "Error" tab in the screen shot came when I tried to see the 
wp-docs Subscribers list from 
http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs.  I got the error 
"wp-docs roster authentication failed".

I agree.. IMHO, I think they should make the MonoBook skin the "default" skin. ;) =)  But, I doubt seeing that happen anytime soon though..lol.. =P

I agree the default design really doesn't serve the content well...
But hey, I guess full design intergration with the wp site is a

I hadn't seen grabperf; that's interesting.  I'm not a sysadmin
anymore; I'm sure there are other monitoring tools I haven't seen.

I've been using wget in a cron job to fetch a few pages from my
server periodically and, if the page times out or there are other
errors, it sends me email.  It's caught several server failures.
If there's no monitoring like that of codex, maybe it would help
to catch the problems as they're happening?  Just an idea...

The codex problems also bug me quite a bit because I am often using
the codex. If the situation does not improve, we will consider moving
it to a different server.

I think it's fate. The 500 errors are symbolic of how cumbersome it is 
to get accurate information.

Or perhaps it's karma. All the users swearing and banging their fists 
out of frustration with the Codex has tipped some metaphysical scale 
enough to effect the server hardware...

Seriously though, there is some great information in the codex but it 
needs a serious going over. I have tried myself, and the first edit I 
did I screwed something up and didn't even notice it (luckily some kind 
individual did notice it, fixed it and let me know). That's about the 
time I started putting 'guides' up on my own site out of frustration 
with the same questions over and over again (in the support forums).

Someone needs to make a decision about the main page/index design/layout 
and then the layout of the actual pages (including date written, 
applicable WP version(s), etc., etc.). Navigation needs to be 
simplified, more luser-friendly. Then hand out topics to volunteers who 
are savvy about that topic.

That's how I would do it when they make me emperor of the universe.

I was at the website of Lorelle for WordPress and she
has listed on her site that you needed help to have
videos tutorials made.

I can make these for you. 

I can begin the second week of December if that works
for you.

Please send me information on what videos you would
like to have done.

There is no limit to the number of videos I can do for
you.  So please let me know of all of the video work
you need done.

Have a wonderful weekend,
Blessings

Very cool! When you say "videos" do you mean like screencasts to 
complement some of our documentation pages? Do you have any examples of 
videos you've done before?
