User Mabel vandalized the "WordPress Features" page.  Here's her  
definitive vision:

http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php? 
title=WordPress_Features&oldid=11319#Customizing_the_Design

The page has, of course, been repaired.

And, while it's nice and cute, this image may be just taking up space:

I'm new to WordPress and the Codex, and I'm totally amazed by the effort put
forth by everyone.

I thought it important to post this in order to recognize the recent New
Pages contributed by authors  Eads, Reportica, Kim, Skippy, Carthik,
PotterSys, and Schulte.  Super Job!

I know many people have contributed in the past to Codex, but special words
of appreciation to Lorelle, Lorelle, and Lorelle,  for their amazing effort
and prodigious output!  Just Awesome!

Note:  Apologies if I missed anyone.

Message-ID: <016301c550c3$2f482830$6402a8c0@DELL8600>

At Lorelle's request the [[Special:Wanted Pages]] was culled for broken
links.

Several items weren't  fix because of the number of broken links or there
was no simple solution.

Those were:
1.User:SimonFarine/plugins -- lots of broken links so consider asking user
to revise (or delete) page?
2.User:serendipity/New Main Page -- lots of broken links so consider asking
user to revise (or delete) page?
3.User:serendipity/Main Page -- lots of broken links so consider asking user
to revise (or delete) page?
4.The five pages referring to Localization Technology -- change these links
to something like MediaWiki
(http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_localization)?
5.Any page related to Spanish (es) -- do nothing?

Are there any suggestions on what to do with these pages.  Thanks for any
input.

I had talked to serendipity before and she told me I could delete the
pages, however, I added <nowiki></nowiki> around the pages to prevent
the links from showing up. I hope SimonFarine doesn't mind. He can
easily reverse the effects, in any case...

They should point to http://codex.wordpress.org/Localizing_WordPress .

Yes, PotterSys and others are still at work with those pages, so we
can let them be.

I'm just getting back to speed up here at the Codex after yet another
study-induced coma. Great job with everything, folks! I am delighted,
and cannot thank everyone enough.

I noticed
http://codex.wordpress.org/New_To_WordPress_-_Where_to_Start

which is a great new article dealing with exactly what the title says.
However, there is
http://codex.wordpress.org/First_Steps_With_WordPress , not to mention
http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress

and possibly some other such pages.

Please try to avoid duplication of effort. 

In fact, the rule of thumb I use is that I try to find one article
that is closest to that great new article I have in mind, and then set
to work on improving that article till it resembles what I have in
mind. In other words, please try to improve existing pages, instead of
creating new pages.

I would love to see the three articles I mentioned merged together,
since, regardless of the differences in approaches, what we should
really be interested in is providing one page to get a novice started
with using WordPress, in this case.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks,
Carthik.

Carthik,

Is this a duplication of effort or a problem with the names of these
articles?

Getting Started with WordPress -- is like a short concise table of contents,
an outline, a map,  for someone that hasn't even installed WordPress.

New to WordPress - Where to Start -- is more of a step-by-step procedures
list, a detailed map,  a planning guide, to getting WordPress up and
running.  Maybe this could be called something like "Implementation Guide."
This article would have a link in Getting Started with WordPress.

First Steps with WordPress  -- is more a tour, or test drive,  of WordPress
once it's installed and running.  Maybe this should be called "A Tour of
WordPress."  This article would have links in the Getting Started with
WordPress and Implementation Guide.

Welcome back, Carthik.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress is the title of an 
entire section in the TOC that includes the other documents dealing with 
getting started.

Where to Start is a new step by step, links only, guide, which has been 
repeated requested.  It is more of a checklist than guide.  First Steps is 
handholding for the total newbie who needs to have someone sit down and talk 
with them. For those who need simple point by point steps, Where to Start 
covers those points. They compliment each other but are totally different.

I agree that duplicated effort on the Codex is not good, but these two are 
completely related and yet serve two different populations and needs. 
Merging them might make it too big.  Where to Start makes a good referral 
for people to save and refer back to, even if they are past the beginner 
stage.

Subject: [wp-docs] Articles Wanted - Test Driving
Message-ID: <000e01c552ae$f0287ea0$6401a8c0@silver>

A week or so ago, Matt posted links to the table of contents for 
TextPattern's stuff.  I cleaned it up to match WordPress, sorta, and created 
a draft of a potential "Articles Wanted" for the Codex list: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_Wanted

If you could go through the list and put a link to any title that already as 
an article or two about it after the title, and/or put your name next to one 
that you'd like to write about, this might help us fill in some blanks that 
are missing in the Codex.

At the bottom of the list are "articles/questions needing answered" I've 
been collecting for months. Some have been requested to come from the old 
Wiki, cleaned up and transferred in, and others are from the forum 
(frequently asked forum questions).

This is just a draft of an Articles Wanted list.  The articles wanted list 
linked to from the How to Help Edit page goes to a Mediawiki made page of 
links to pages that were created but never done - which isn't true. These 
are/were mostly links that were boo boo links.  MichaelH went through and 
beautifully helped us clean those out and fix them.  Now we need a REAL 
articles wanted page.  So take this one for a test drive.

Message-ID: <848680A881C76145A25A85D48D5CE2C6034B79F0@thor.clickdata.com>

 
I have written an article on my Blog about using and styling definition
lists instead of unordered lists with get_linksbyname. I was wondering if
might be of any benefit to add a brief <dl> example to the page
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_linksbyname? Something like -


<dl>
   <?php get_linksbyname('Portfoliio', '<dt>', '</dd>','</dt><dd>
', TRUE, 'rating', TRUE, FALSE, -1, FALSE); ?>
</dl>


What is the protocol on adding to the Codex? Can anyone? Do you link against
articles with more info or is this frowned upon? If you'd like to see the
existing article it is http://www.scottmcdaniel.com/?p=33

Thanks,

Scott McDaniel

As it says on the Template Tags index:

"If you have an interesting twist on the implementation of one or more 
tags, feel free to add an example for the benefit of other WordPress users."

Just create a Codex account and have at it! And feel free to link to 
your post if it provides additional information about the example.

This is the page on it:

http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support

When you search the search box for 'xml-rpc' it doesn't come up, which 
is a testament to the Codex's crappy search. Perhaps we should replace 
that with a Google box.

So, I guess it's doing something funky with the dash? Any idea what?

Would it be viable to patch Codex to just strip the dashes out of search 
queries, or would that have horrible side-effects?

The code is already such a bear to maintain, I wouldn't want to have to 
deal with patches as well. Mediawiki is functional but a real pain to use.

Subject: [wp-docs] Some meta work at the Codex
Message-ID: <80f75db05051019522366a020@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I should say I am relatively done with what I have been working at the
past week or so, with a lot of help from Lorelle.

I have tried to make it easier for people wanting to contribute to the
Codex to do so.

I started with the community portal since that is linked off of the sidebar:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Community_Portal

A person starting there, or at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Contributing should be able to start
doing something useful sooner than earlier.

I have moved most of the Codex maintenance/development related pages
to the "Codex:" namespace to avoid confusion, and to enable people to
list the pages in a quicker fashion :
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&from=&namespace=4
(Get there easier from Special:Allpages using the dropdown menu)

I also updated the guidelines, which are now at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines - no major changes, only
those that were discussed on this list in March '05.

So, in short, some pages have been rewritten, whereas some have been
reorganized, besides the pages that I linked to above, the following
are either new, or re-organized :
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:About
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Maintenance
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Creating_a_User_page
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Creating_a_New_Page

Of which, the content for the last three was largely written up by
Lorelle - many thanks :)


I would be glad if you all could spare some time, and let me know if
the pages can be improved from the point of view of a new codex
volunteer. I would gladder still if you could make the changes
yourself :) The Talk pages are ready to receive comments, so go forth,
and I am sorry it took so long to get back to the Codex.


Carthik.

Per the most recent Meet Up, we'd like people to share their areas of 
interest in working on the Codex. The purpose of this is to direct 
volunteers to their areas of interest on the Codex, have their energies 
directed, and possibly be given tasks and assignments.

There are two areas to "sign up".

1. http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Things_to_Do_by_Codex_Section
Lists the various tasks organized by Codex Section.  If you want to 
coordinate efforts on a particular section, please sign your name with the

I just wanted to do a quick bit of cheering for all the great 
contributions on the Codex.

More and more I'm able to pop into the support forums, read a question, 
and then post a link to a specific Codex page.  I'm _amazed_ at how 
thorough it's become.

I know we have a lot of work left to do, but I don't want to miss this 
opportunity to celebrate our success so far.

Keep up the great work!

I signed up, and would like everyone to try and state what they like
working on at the Codex, especially those that have been with the
project for a long time now, so that new contributors know who to turn
to :)

Good Afternoon,

A new registered user at Codex  (User:Al-khowarizmi) asked why he couldn't
email another Codex user rather than clutter the User's Discussion page with
certain types of communication.

Is that ability disabled (or not recommended) in Codex, or is it not
available with the current Codex version of MediaWiki?

Thanks for any input.

Thanks for the reply James.

At wikimedia.org, in the sidebar Tool Box section, there is an 'Email this
User' option when you visit a User Page, but I don't see that in Codex.

I'm guessing that ability is turned off in Codex.  It could be the version
of Mediawiki used for Codex doesn't support this option--the User
Preferences screen doesn't have the field "Disable email from other users"
as referred to User Preferences Help.

I remember that not so long ago, there was a link on the sidebar in
user pages to email the User. I used that to email MDAWaffe once.

The lack of that link should be compensated by the presence of the
wp-docs mailing list, where a larger audience will be able to answer
your questions.

If you need to email a real person, email me :) My address is on my User page.

Regards,
Carthik.

Subject: [wp-docs] Request for spammers list
Message-ID: <003701c5581b$93fadde0$6401a8c0@silver>

We had the following posted on the Comment Spam Codex article discussion
page:

+++++++++++
Can we create a page in the codex where wordpress users can post email
addresses or websites of folks who repeatedly comment spam them?
Something similar to Spam Words, but more pertaining to identifying
spammers.
For example, one of my wordpress blogs has been hit over 20 times in the
past day by a spammer w/various subdomains on the following two domains:
mp3se.com areaofmusic.net
I've added those domains to my Comment Blacklist, but it would be nice to
have a central area where WP users could all post the sites that are comment
spamming them..
+++++++++++++

We do have the spam words list, but what about having this kind of list?  Is
is appropriate?  Is it usable?

I wouldn't be inclined to host such a list, it would be more trouble 
than it's worth.

Doesn't it kind of give the spammers what they want: free advertising?

There is more than one spam plugin that uses/provides a distributed spam 
wordlist.  The list does not publish as links that you can view on a 
site, doesn't need to be maintained by the site admin for use because 
it's automatically updated by the plugin, and doesn't need to be 
maintained by Codex authors which is subject to errors and abuse.  I've 
seen someone  else's solution that implements distributing such a list 
via XML-RPC, and I've also written my own using the same method, called OSA.

If this user is concerned about keeping a current wordlist, I would 
suggest using such a plugin.

Ok, after a bit of digging I see there's no forms support in Mediawiki. 
So goes that brilliant idea.

Well, for those who would like one:

Hi all,

I know this bug where the link has to have the exact same title when
linking to another wiki page (or the link shows up in red as an "edit
page" link) has been bugging quite a few folks for quite some time,
and creating maintenance issue for me :)

So I filed a bug at mediawiki/wikimedia.

All concerned can track/improve the bug report:

Thank you,

Make it into an FAQ ?

Some people don't like Codex, but I'll bet they are familiar with WP :)
One post - let it contain all the questions and all the answers that we 
currently have on the FAQ (I'll move it all over)
(Or a few posts, each using (more.....) )

Comments are for
"What do you want to see answered ?"
"What can we answer better ?"
"What have you learned that we can add ?"

No work to set up.
Minimal work to maintain.
Potentially useful information to be gained.

Appoint a couple of authors .....

Matt,

Whatever you think is best. Me and Podz and a few others put some
effort into it, but it disn't quite take off the way it was intended.

I am not against moving the information into the Codex FAQ.

If you want to breathe some life into into, and keep it a FAQ, powered
by wordpress, that is cool too. It should be a lot easier with 1.5.1.1

Subject: [wp-docs] New article on Semantics
Message-ID: <000b01c55db9$4bc287a0$6401a8c0@silver>

MichaelH has written a brilliant article on the semantics of WordPress at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MichaelH/Semantics.  I'm going to go through 
it again this weekend and then move it into the main stuff.  It takes the 
user step-by-step, with some light-hearted techniques, through the naming of 
all the different parts and pieces and terminology used by WordPress.  He's 
included great sections for the semantics of Content, Design, Adminstration, 
Help and even the history of the name "WordPress".  Concise and witty.

Take a look and slice and dice over the weekend and let's make this public. 
Great work, Michael.  His first Codex article!

By the way, Michael has also taken on the task of being the "official 
greeter" of new users to the Codex.  Thanks for that, too.

Message-ID: <000c01c55db9$4f7d93d0$6401a8c0@silver>

I posted this a while ago, but nothing seemed to happen on it.  I went 
through the links Matt sent us of the Table of Contents for TextPattern and 
changed it to kinda match WordPress.  I created 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_Wanted as a good reference 
to match Codex material and look at where we are missing documentation.

Please take a look at this and if you find an article on the Codex that 
"matches" the title, post it after the title and if you see a gap that you 
can fill with an article, let us know and put your name next to it (four 
tildes signature).  If it doesn't apply at all, strike it out with a note so 
we all understand why.

I know there is a move to really update and revise the way the Codex works, 
and this might help us make the transition.  Thanks.

I've been quite public about the TOO MANY WORDPRESS SITES issue.  If you 
keep it, then move all of the Codex FAQs into it and we'll make sure the 
Codex links to it.  But if you are going to keep the Codex or some version 
thereof as the main documentation site, keep all the documentation together.

I'm a fan of "all documentation in one place".  This makes it easy for the 
user, beginner or advanced, and creates a single respository of information.

If I ruled the world, the Codex name would fade off into some dark and dusty 
spot where spiders hang out and WordPress would have a docs.wordpress.org or 
wordpressdocs.org or wordpress.docs.org or something simple, easy to 
remember, and easy to find name.  But ruling the world is Matt's job.  ;-)

After letting the old 1.2 version of Writing Posts sit there until moss grew

http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts and the old one is at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts/Posts_1.2, a subpage per consult 
with Carthik.

Take a whack at it.

Oh, and thanks again to matt for getting the image to finally work and to 
Carthik who worked major overtime adding brand new screen shots of 1.5.1 to 
the Codex.  Beautiful.  Let's use them, folks.

Looks pretty good, I can add a link on the Your WordPress posting form 
to this article when it's done.

Micheal's article looks good too, I like how it's heavily inter-linked 
with the rest of the Codex. That's a great model to follow for all our 
articles.

I have said already ages ago* that it might be a good idea to actually 
forward faq.wordpress.org <http://faq.wordpress.org> to
faq.wordpress.net<http://faq.wordpress.net>for the time being, in
order to minimize confusion. But nobody ever listens
to me anyway. Maybe I should employ a different tactic henceforth and always 
propose the direct opposite of what I want, thus maximising the chances of 
getting it... ;)
 Anyway: I think WordPress is more suitable as a FAQ list than the codex, 
plus everything links there by now.
Or, to employ my new tactic: Move everything into the codex and break as 
many links as possible... ;o)
 Regards,
Christian

It's worked before, she whines loudly to the unseen audience.

When I move a page within the Codex, and firmly and obsessively make sure 
the "MOVE TALK PAGE" is CHECKED, it doesn't move the talk page.  Started 
this weekend.

Also, when I delete a page, I get a SQL warning:

Database error:From Codex
A database query syntax error has occurred. This may indicate a bug in the 
software. The last attempted database query was:
(SQL query hidden)
from within function "LogPage::saveContent". MySQL returned error "1054: 
Unknown column 'log_params' in 'field list' (localhost)".

Ah, the fixing of the Codex never ends.

Carthik made a plea in the IRC Meetup last Wednesday that he needed 5 or so 
people this past weekend to really clean things up in the Codex. I know it 
was last minute and then not announced on the mailing list or to a wider 
audience, and attendence was justifiably low.  I've recommended to him that 
we need to do a Codex Wiki Week, a week long (one weekend to a second 
weekend) major maintenance recruitment.

1. Check out the new http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Cleanup Sign up list 
and information
2. Promote this (if it meets approval from you all) heavily in the Forums 
and different WordPress sites.
3. For those who are now "in charge" of administering certain areas, make a 
list of the tasks/articles you need done in your section and add it to the 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks list so we know what is needed and 
people can see where they can help.
4. If you haven't signed up to be responsible for an area or for a task in 
the Codex - get in gear, folks.  It doesn't mean you have to spend every 
waking moment in the Codex, but a couple hours or less a week would be nice 
payback for this fabulous software...hint hint with a hammer.

The last couple of "Wiki Days/Weekends" were a total bust.  I know everyone 
is busy, but if we put all our energy into a concentrated effort, we can get 
the big holes in the documentation fixed and get on with the fun of the rest 
of our lives...until the next major WordPress Release means we have to 
change things.

If you are looking for new ideas on what to add or do on the Codex, here are 
some sources:

Is it me or does Mediawiki just suck?  It seems like it's always falling 
apart like this.

I ask out of personal interest because my wife's company is thinking 
about using a wiki for their in-house tech notes, and she mentioned some 
discussion of Mediawiki.  I think they brought it up because it's 
well-known ("As used by Wikipedia!"), but I told her of the many 
problems Codex has had with it.

I don't know what I'm hoping for by posting this, but damn, aren't we 
tired of the wiki breaking all the time?  If this is going to be the 
main WordPress documentation, it can't be this flaky.

Owen,

1. Use a different directory (other than the root) for the home of the
pages. Wikipedia uses a /wiki/pagename structure.
2. Use the last stable version. Do not upgrade to betas/non-stable
versions and you should be fine.

This should be the case when you are moving pages between namespaces.
Other wise It should work fine. In case the talk page does not get
moved, move it seperately, like you moved the other page.

There are problems wiht updating the logs that generate pages like the
move log, the delete log, and other logs. This does not bug the rest
of the normal operation of the Codex.

I would like the process to conform to some norms. If in doubt, please
ask before diving in to remove the CopyEdit tags etc. If you are in
the slightest bit of doubt, do not remove the copyedit tag, but
copyedit it anyways.

Subject: [wp-docs] Unsticky
Message-ID: <4293A8E2.5080609@tamba2.org.uk>

I'm going to unsticky the 1.5 > 1.5.1 thread:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/33189

It's been 4 days since it was last posted to and overuse of stickies 
isn't a good thing.

I do think though that this one thread is a valuable resource from which 
a lot can be taken when the next upgrade - however minor - occurs. I 
also think that at the next upgrade, another dedicated thread should be 
opened for the same reasons:
- a good hindsight tool
- prevents the forums filling with what could be (even more) oft 
repeated issues.

And Relle ... I've not forgotten, I've just been completely swamped with 
  emails for help !

[Beating an old thread]

I've moved this page to [[wpdb Class]].  I had to move in the  
(minimal) talk page manually.  The content is there, but the  
discussion tab always links to an editing screen rather than a  
viewing screen.  Unless there's an easy fix for that annoyance, I'd  
suggest just deleting the talk page and starting a new one.

Subject: [wp-docs] Article on Headers
Message-ID: <01e001c561a5$1b25d710$6401a8c0@silver>

After interviewing a bunch of people, and plowing through code, I've posted 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Headers_and_Header_Art.  I'd like to 
speed up the release on this if possible.  Hack and whack, please,  And 
check code.

It's for Lessons, as it does handholding, but I'm not totally happy with the 
title, so I'm open to suggestions for when it moves into the main 
documentation.  I also did screenshots of the headers of the Theme contest 
winners as examples and inspiration, so when it goes into the main 
documentation, it would be nice to let these folks know that their site is 
so showcased.

Matt, I also used your image rotator script, so if there is anything you 
want to fix on that, which you don't need to as far as I know (I'm using 
it), just a heads up.

I've also notifed 2notch at 
http://www.digitalwestex.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=6 (and interviewed 
him - he helped tons on this article) that there is a link to his site in 
the article and he's ready with his WordPress header art.

Not quite sure where this post should go ....

Right now on the front page I see:

categories
category
image
images
link
links
page
pages
permalink
permalinks
plugin
plugins
post
posts
theme
themes

Some code to knock the 's' off would be useful, as would the ability to 
strip tags. The occasional post take it to extremes and while it's 
amusing and no huge problem, redoing would be useful too.

Guess this work is in the pipeline ?

I've used both "plugin" and "plugins" on purpose, I don't remember why 
though.

Anyway you guys let me know which tags you want to combine and I will.

The "s"es would be a prime place to start.

Should they be normalized with or without Ss'sss. Just let me know the 
specific tags you want combined into what, and I'll do that. I can't 
just strip every trailing S off. (At least not on the WordPres forums. ;)

Hmm..... I originally asked because less tags being visible for obvious 
use may help tighten things up, whereas losing the duping would show 
more tags on the front page.
If pushed, I'd keep the Ss'ssss :)

Wow.  If Mozilla can theme MediaWiki, surely we can!  =)
