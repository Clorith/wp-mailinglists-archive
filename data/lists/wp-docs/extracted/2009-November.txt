Subject: [wp-docs] WPMU Functions and hi
Message-ID: <414fb2900911090136u438e81b4n8b24d29a643a6d9b@mail.gmail.com>

Hey, Peter here (Pumpkinslayer)

First time in here so hello. I'm a long-time WPMU user. The biggest
project was a hack of Dr. Dave's anti-spam ported to MU (yes, a while
back). I do still run all my domains off a single install of MU. I've
done very little hacking in the last 3 years, but am keen on editing
and tightening up documentation.

Chiming in on the WPMU Functions thread that came up last month.

I would suggest naming the WPMU Functions in the same way as the main
WordPress content.

In the standard version there are...

Function_Reference (lists all functions)
Function_Reference/function_name (describes functions)
Category:Functions (category)

There are already a ton of pages for WPMU but I'd suggest naming like this:

WPMU_Function_Reference (lists all functions)
WPMU_Function_Reference/function_name (describes function)
Category:WPMU_Functions (category)

I recommend prefixing WPMU_ on all the MU stuff. I don't know how
Wikimedia handles page name changes in terms of redirection, but this
is my suggestion (I won't jump in and change them, that's too big a
spanner in the works in one go)

Ideas, opinions and suggestions please.

Thanks,
Peter

My only issue is that then you would have to type http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU_Functions/WPMU_get_blog_options

Which is unnessisary I personally would say no to the prefixing  
because it is duplicating information.

However that's just me.

That said for normal pages it's a great idea I had thought that  
renaming functions to function reference would ad more continuity and  
if that page were laid out the same that would be good too.





Kind Regards

Good point Tom, so I propose not to separate wp and mu function
references in their naming, as they are all function references, ie:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpmu_function_name

This page should remain:
http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU_Function_Reference (currently called
WPMU_Functions)
     Or even just include this as a smaller section at the bottom of
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference

This category should remain:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Category:WPMU_Functions

There will be no confusion putting prefixing Function_Reference on
both because wpmu pages would be in Category:WPMU_Functions and listed
in WPMU_Function_Reference page.

This also simplifies the naming. ALL functions (mu or regular) would
be Function_Reference/function_name, because they are all function
references, but the categories tell them apart.

This also places WPMU more as an extension of WP, rather than
something separate.

Cheers,
Peter

Hi Peter,

I'm afraid I don't agree with a number of your points.  I'll expand below:

Peter Stewart wrote:

> references in their naming, as they are all function references, ie:

>   
They are all function references, but of two distinct applications.  See 
further comments below.
> This page should remain:
> http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU_Function_Reference (currently called
> WPMU_Functions)
>   
Renaming it seems reasonably sensible, but at the same time I think it 
would need to be refactored to be similar to the main function reference 
-- at the moment it's not much of a reference, just a list!  Splitting 
functions up into categories would make it much more user friendly.
>      Or even just include this as a smaller section at the bottom of

>   
Absolutely not.  WPMU and WP keep separate codebases -- they are not 
currently the same thing.  Mixing the functions up may well lead to 
confusion amongst developers new to WP who might think that those 
functions are available to them.  They should be distinct from the 
functions bundled in WP for as long as MU is distinct from the main WP 
codebase.

I disagree.  Mixing the functions up will cause confusion.  Categories 
are only listed at the bottom of each page, and I would even go so far 
as to suggest that the majority of 'normal' users aren't really aware of 
their existence. It's very helpful to have that kind of information in 
the page title (not to mention having it in the address bar itself!), 
and as the title is derived from the URL I don't think this should be 
changed.
> This also places WPMU more as an extension of WP, rather than

Which, in my opinion, is wrong.  Until the two are merged it's a 
different thing and we shouldn't muddle it all together

Hi, guys,

I've got some questions for you, but first let me introduce myself.
My name is C?tia and I'm from the Brazilian WP Community and I'm responsible
for the br.wordpress.org. I've got an email sent through its contact form
from a person asking me if she can publish parts of the Codex in a book she
will soon release, and if so, how she should proceed about copyrights and
such.
Well, I understand the Codex is also released under the GPL (as stated here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:About), however, the GPL isn't very clear
about this issue.
So, my questions are:
1. Are there any easy guidelines on how to proceed in such a case?
2. Who should be copyrighted, this list here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Copyright_Holders (it seems to be the WP coders
rather than the contributors to the codex) or does it depends on which page
will be included, so she should look for the author of that specific page?
3. Is there anybody this person should be talking to rather than me, since I
don't know much about it?

Thanks in advance,

Not sure why not look at other wordpress books?

That seems irelivent, who owns wordpress?

Perhaps worth talking with Automattic about it as they will have a  
better idea I would think but in my opinion they should only be  
quoting the Codex if they are selling the book, its not fair to just  
print out the codex.

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex licence issue

This situation brings me to giving my own thoughts on the Codex licensing.

 

The GPL is great for code and all, but the Codex isn?t a piece of code in the traditional sense; it?s clearly documentation. Wikipedia?s original licensing was under the GNU Free Documentation License (as are some ?open source? books like the Free High School Science Texts) because that?s the kind of license that is more suited to documentation. The GPL references ?the Program? many times, and I don?t see how the textual documentation on the Codex is a Program. I personally feel that the GNU Free Documentation License would be in line with the spirit of the GPL, while the use of a Creative Commons license would be make sharing/re-using more accessible.

 

In any case, in response to your questions:

1. There aren?t really easy guidelines for such a case. Unless you are the copyright owner or the agent of the owners, you cannot sublicense the content of the Codex except in line with the official license (which happens to be the GPL). The person who wants to print out the Codex in her book might want to clear this up with Automattic.

2. The list on the Codex of ?Copyright Holders? are core code contributors as opposed to Codex contributors. It is also difficult to cite the author of a specific page, since many people under pseudonyms and Internet usernames may have edited it. If Wikipedia is any guide in this gray area, the ?authors? on a collaborative wiki are the ?[WordPress Codex] contributors?.

3. Again, I think this person should contact Automattic, since they own the project and are the guardians of WordPress in general. However, note that the licensing on the Codex is blurry in that the copyrights on the wiki are not explicitly transferred to Automattic, so the rightsholders of Codex content are essentially contributors from around the world who have agreed to contribute under the GPL. I?m not sure if the Codex has a Terms of Service or contract that gives Automattic the right to sublicense under different terms.

 

I?m not an expert by any means, so please double-check everything I?ve said.

 

Regards,

Frederick Ding

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex licence issue

 

Hi, guys,

I've got some questions for you, but first let me introduce myself.
My name is C?tia and I'm from the Brazilian WP Community and I'm responsible for the br.wordpress.org. I've got an email sent through its contact form from a person asking me if she can publish parts of the Codex in a book she will soon release, and if so, how she should proceed about copyrights and such.
Well, I understand the Codex is also released under the GPL (as stated here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:About), however, the GPL isn't very clear about this issue.
So, my questions are:
1. Are there any easy guidelines on how to proceed in such a case?
2. Who should be copyrighted, this list here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Copyright_Holders (it seems to be the WP coders rather than the contributors to the codex) or does it depends on which page will be included, so she should look for the author of that specific page?
3. Is there anybody this person should be talking to rather than me, since I don't know much about it?

Thanks in advance,

As one of the long time editors and contributors to the WordPress Codex, I
echo the thoughts of other documentation team members. First, thank you for
asking. That is much appreciated. Few do, so thank you for your gracious
inquiry.

However, I have a few thoughts on this, unrelated to the legal
ramifications. If someone just copies the WordPress Codex content and puts
it into a book without adding their own original contributions, edits, and
voice, who would bother spending money on what they can get for free, and
really, what does that say about the quality of the author's work that
plagiarism would even be considered acceptable, not to mention the
reflection of the work on the editor and publisher of such a book. But
that's my personal opinion, as a fellow author and web publisher. In today's
social web, reputation is really important. I'd hate to risk it.

Regarding the rest, the license is as stated. The WordPress Codex is open to
all to contribute and make use of the content. The WordPress Handbook is
different and will use Codex content but is its own creature which may have
different rules and licenses. We'll have to face that when it is available.

As for changing the copyright status of the Codex, this has been debated
extensively since day one and we're really proud of the licensing as it
stands. We're open to changes, especially if there are changes in copyright
laws with the evolution of web publishing and such, so if anyone has better
recommendations, let's start digging again into the legal ramifications of
how this all works.

I agree with Lorelle in that publishing a book composed entirely of the work of others is a bad reflection of the author. I also think that it?s a gross error to republish the work of others without adding their own contributions and edits. However, at this point I don?t believe we have enough information to judge the intentions of the author because all that was said was ?a person asking me if she can publish parts of the Codex in a book?.

 

In any case, the transformation of a work from one medium into another can be useful, even if few changes are made. If a snapshot of Wikipedia were to be printed, published and bound, that becomes a useful contribution to human knowledge because it?s more accessible to those without access to the Internet. Similarly, a printed WordPress book (I?m waiting for the handbook in this case) might actually be a useful transformation of the Codex materials, even though the licensing becomes confusing.

 

I can understand that the WordPress project is very proud of its GPL licensing. Perhaps adaptations to the Codex licensing can be a topic for future discussion.

 

Regards,

Frederick Ding

Hi guys,

Thanks for your insights.

It's true what you said, Frederick, I have no idea about what parts and how
this person intends to use the codex, from what I understood, she just wants
to quote something, I'm not sure. I asked her what she is planning to do
excatly. I've got no answer yet.

I just wanted to know how to guide her better so she won't get into trouble
because of lack of information from my part. Here in Brazil, when people
have questions about WordPress, they come to me, so I think I must be well
informed about these issues.

Anyway, I still don't know yet who should be copyrighted and how the thing
must be done (for example, should her add a gpl license to her book?). I
guess I'll take Tom's advice and suggest her to contact someone at
Automattic.

Thanks again,

C?tia
