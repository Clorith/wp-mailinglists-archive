Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress Codex Update Project
Message-ID: <BANLkTimhnvE34htu_UNt3SnM85EO7cmO2Q@mail.gmail.com>

WordCamp Developer starts tomorrow and as announced, people are chomping at
the bit to pitch in on the drive to help update the Codex. I'm sure you are
all ready to see some activity on the Codex as much as I am.

http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/ is the to do list for the project to list
the things needing doing and talk about the various tasks. This is not a
replacement for the mailing list but something to help us track the various
tasks during this project.

Because so much should be going on tomorrow, and has already started with
some enthusiastic WordPress Community members, we're temporarily skipping
the "post to the mailing list" to announce a new article that needs work and
asking people to post them to the task list on that blog.

I'm so excited about this and thrilled that WordCamp Developers is taking
this initiative. Other WordCamps have done similar efforts, but not to this
extend. Maybe this could be a new tradition! :D

Thanks for all your help and for helping these people jumping on the Codex.
We'll be running the live chat tomorrow, too, so see you there!

Lorelle,

Do the WP-Docs team have a template to use for creating new Codex entries?
There have been a few times that I've noticed missing entries for various
functions, and thought, "I wonder if I should add something?". Having a
template from which to start might lower the barrier to contribution.

If none exists, and if it would be useful, I wouldn't mind taking a stab at
creating one?

This question might be off-topic for the current Codex push (which appears
to be an effort to update *existing* entries), and if so, I apologize.

Chip

I believe there is. Check Templates in the Codex. I'm in an RV traveling at
the moment. :D

Most copy and paste the previous looks, but go for it.

This is a push for updates and adding, with no restrictions. Just jump and
keep us updated in the task list blog so we can all know what's going on and
no one steps on Codex toes. :D We've done that before during these projects
with three people editing the same page causing conflicts, so thank goodness
there is something wonderful like the P2 Theme to keep us updated!!!

Thanks for jumping in. This is like old times and going to be too much
fun!!!

Subject: [wp-docs] Dump of the Codex?
Message-ID: <29366247.1932.1306414412697.JavaMail.geo-discussion-forums@yqhc1>

Is it possible to get a full dump of the Codex - the current pages and their 
history? I would like to do this without taxing the system, so a single 
database dump is probably most fit for this.

This would allow creating a local copy 
[ http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/211/local-copy-of-wordpress-codex 
], or doing other research on the Codex to find out ways to improve it.

Greetings,

Jan Fabry

People have done this over the years, and a search should turn up copies.
The problem is that the Codex is a living document and changes daily, so
these tend to go out of date fast.

I've been trying to reply to this hopefully the note got through that people
have grabbed the whole context of the Codex over the years and the zip files
can be found all over the place through a search, but it goes out of date
very fast. It's kind of a waste of time, though it hasn't stopped people's
determination.

The reason the email keeps bouncing back on me is that the reply included a
wp-docs in Google Groups. We don't have anything on there to the best of my
knowledge, or has something changed?

Thanks,

Lorelle

get_posts()

the docs here seem a little sparse, particularly with regards to function
arguments

the problem i found today specifically, was that the "numberposts" argument
wasn't explicitly described that it a) has a default, and b) can be
overrided with -1 for all

can it not be described similar to the php.net documentation where each
permutation is described?

Indeed, I was thinking of an automated solution, one that would generate a 
dump every week or so. There is the Export page [ 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Export ], but currently you have to list 
all pages individually. A newer version of MediaWiki allows you to dump all 
pages in a namespace [ 
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Parameters_to_Special:Export ], which 
would be a great advantage - but I don't know what the upgrade plans for the 
Codex are?

This is my fault. I tried setting up a transparent mirror of the mailinglist 
on Google Groups, like there is for wp-hackers. It almost works, the only 
issue left is that the Reply-To header is set to both 
wp-docs at lists.automattic.com and wp-docs at googlegroups.com, while it should 
only be the former.

I know it is possible, because it works for wp-hackers, and I hope to 
correct it for this mirror too soon [ 
http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/15602/mirroring-a-mailing-list-in-google-groups 
]. You still have to be a member of the Automattic list, so it is no extra 
spam vector, I just did it for the interface and search capabilities. If you 
remove Google from the reply field it should work without error, and as I 
said I hope to correct this soon, I apologize for the inconvenience.

Greetings,

wp_list_categories() has a good model to follow.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_categories

Edit the Parameters section to see how it is done there and
use that format.

I'm not sure what you mean by the upgrade plans for the Codex.

I did a little searching for you.

http://cleverwp.com/download-292-pages-of-wordpress-functions/
http://download-book.net/wordpress-codex-in-pdf.html
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpress-codex-documentation-as-a-single-download
http://www.bluelayermedia.com/blog/downloadable-wordpress-codex
http://www.hotfilesearch.com/download/52936108-Wordpress-CODEX-Offline-V2.zip.html
http://www.tamba2.org.uk/T2/codex-and-pdf/
Use HTTrack to download all the pages

Not sure why the duplicate mirror on Google Groups is important to do as
I've talked to Jane Wells and Andrew Nacin and others about moving this to a
P2 site as soon as possible, as many of the other groups have done. Did
WordPress Foundation ask you to set up the mirror? Just trying to
understand.

Thanks,

Lorelle

The current version of MediaWiki would provide an easy way to download all 
pages and their history. So if the Codex will be upgraded in the near future 
I can wait for that. Otherwise I would create a way around it, with a script 
that will do multiple export requests.

Thank you for that! However, I want frequent (say weekly) dumps, to get some 
interesting statistics, which should result in ways to encourage people even 
more to contribute to the codex.

No, nobody asked me to do it. I just thought that it would be easier to read 
the group like that. I only read about the plans to move to P2 after I set 
up the mirror. (The only downside to a blog instead of a mailing list is 
that it is harder for a newcomer to start a new topic - like this one. Or is 
there a "submit a post" possibility?)

Thank you, for all the work you have done to educate users and maintain 
resources for developers. I hope I can use the "good vibes" that I got from 
the WordPress Stack Exchange to improve the Codex too.

Greetings from a sunny Belgium (we could use some rain here),

We've been waiting for a while for an update to MediaWiki. As the Codex is
so locked in with the WordPress.org site, a specialist must handle that and
we're hoping that will happen soon.

Curious as to the stats you are seeking as MediaWiki has stats for activity
included on the special pages for the Codex, which would not require
downloading the whole Codex. Can you see those? If you can't, let me know
what specific numbers you are looking for and I'll help get them to you.
Anything that can encourage more activity is always welcome.

A P2 theme for the Codex docs team would allow anyone to post to it. Easy
and simple. Even email notifications.

Thanks,

Lorelle

In fact the only thing waiting on it is email notifications. Expect that
this week.
