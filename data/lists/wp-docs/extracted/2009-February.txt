All I know is if one checks one's site logs, one will often find
favicon.ico is the #1 requested of all files. One might even create
one for the sole reason that sending 404s or 301s etc. use more
bandwidth than just giving the browser what it wants directly...

In my experience, the main problem is when you have XML structured
files with a large element that is wrapped by the XML editor across
say, 30 lines. If you change a single word at the beginiing of that
element, the whole element gets re-wrapped.

As far as Subversion is concerned, it will see 30 changed lines
instead one changed element. When you get a large number of these, it
can be tiresome to see what has really changed.

When you add in the idea of multiple people editing the same resource,
where someone might change a single word at the opposite end of the
same element. Subversion in that case would likely show a conflict for
every line of that element whereas, the change ought to be easy to
merge.

When the XML files are the size of those in the subversion book, I
would imagine that it would quickly become an impossible task to use
subversion to manage changes XML files in the same way you would
manage code changes.

It is quite a while since I tried to manage structured documents in
this way, so it may be that things have improved.

Subject: [wp-docs] Unable to upload file into Codex
Message-ID: <601901c99683$3da27930$6701a8c0@dell8600>

A Codex user notified me [1] that they couldn't upload a file into Codex.

When attempting to upload a file, this error message is displayed:
"The upload directory (public) is not writable by the webserver. "

Thanks for looking at this problem.

It appears to have been a server issue and it is all fixed. Thanks for
letting us know!
