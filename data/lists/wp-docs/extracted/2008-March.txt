This reference [1], at the bottom of [2], causes a 403 error.

Not sure what needs fixing...

I'm guessing the server's thinking that the browser's requesting to open the
.htaccess file, which has 403 protection on it. Simply removing the dot from
the article name would fix it, but I couldn't move or rename the original
article so I've created a copy of the page [1].

I also went around to all of the pages linking to the original article [2]
and changed the link, they all now point to the new one [3].

I'm an editor and I was trying to contribute by editing some of the pages,
but was not able to find editing standards. I think having some guidelines
will help keep the document consistent and clear for users.  I have a couple
of associates who have also noticed this deficiency and are willing to help
out on this project.

I would like to modify the Codex:Guidelines page by adding a section with
style information. Proposed topics include proper style for writing about
the interface (e.g., how to refer to a button or link), proper action words
to use with the interface (e.g., click a button, press a key, select a check
box), and grammatical errors/inconsistencies (e.g., Internet/internet, Web
site/website, log in/login).

Does this sound like it would be helpful?

Bridie,

That sounds like a winner.  Please have a go at it.

Not sure if you want to add to the existing section [1] or create a new 
section...

Thanks for contributing to Codex.

Thank you for your effort but before you go too far, please see:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Contributing
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Maintenance
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Styles

As a guide to what is already in place.

As an organic manual, these have evolved over time. Names for things have
also changed, and we're trying to be very strict about consistency with
naming references. See http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels for
the current namings of parts and pieces. For example, the WordPress
Administration Panels are not called the "Dashboard" which is a specific
panel in the Administration Panels. WordPress Plugins are Plugins not
plug-ins, and Pages in WordPress are capitalized to avoid confusion with
pages as web pages which any page in a WordPress blog could be but Pages are
different - don't get me started on the stupid naming. I fought that when it
was created and lost. Check out
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Semantics which goes on to define the
WordPress terminology.

We definitely need help and I spend a lot of time editing documents to
maintain this consistency in style, so all help is welcome.

Thank you,

Lorelle

This page has some great info on it:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages

I'm going through WP and adding contextual help and links to the Codex 
where appropiate.

But one downside of pages like the above is to link to a specific 
concept, like page templates, I have to link to this:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Creating_your_own_Page_Templates

That URL will break if anyone changes the heading for that section. It 
also tosses someone in the middle of a longer piece without context.

Just something to think about.

I wanted to break up such articles into individual ones, which I still do.
However, at the time, I was vetoed. Are you suggesting we break these up?
I'm willing. I hate having such detailed information lost in too much
documentation on one page.

Also, we need to fix the style problems on the Codex. Who do we talk to? You
or whoever is in charge of that area of Automattic/WordPress that has to do
with webmaster stuff?

Thanks! And thanks for the help.

That was probably the best decision with the information at the time. 
I'd support breaking articles up more into more of a page-per-concept.

It would certainly make it easier for me to link to specific parts of 
the Codex, and also we could set up redirects if things change down the 
line.

Using section links can be hazardous--don't know how many times I've 
directed people in the forum to 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Page_Templates

This is even a problem with sections addressed by other articles in Codex. 
There's the "What links here" tool but that only 'tests' the article name, 
not sections.  Invalid sections are not shown as invalid links, even when 
that reference is to an invalid section in the same article.

One thing you can do is place [[Category:UI Link]] in those articles that 
you link in the WordPress core.  Then, periodically the links in the core 
have to be checked.  It's not much, but short of Protecting the article not 
sure what else you can do.

Regards.

+1 to splitting out the pages so that those linked by the UI are
individual pages.

+1 to this new Category

Should we also add a template to the pages and lock them for general
editing?

Actually, it's not new. Perhaps underused, though. :)

-100 to that idea. Putting barriers up to people editing the Codex is 
a bad idea, in my opinion. It's difficult enough now to get people to 
contribute to the Codex -- very useful to at least be able to say on 
Hackers "Oh, can you go fix that problem you just pointed out, 
please?" I realize these are high-profile articles, but I'm still 
against having a hierarchy of "you are only allowed to do this much 
until you prove yourself" in the Codex.

I won't have time in the next few days, and I'm surprised Matt has time
right now, too. :D But when I get back home in a few days from SF, I'll
start separating those pages that have been bothering me for so long.

I should also have the new table of contents set for discussion by next
week. I'd planned to have them done by now, but moving 2.5 release up (not
back) changed that schedule for me.

Jennifer, I saw that you mentioned a need to update the Quicktags article on
the hackers list. I had been researching that and coming up empty except for
some Plugins which do this without digging into the code.

Generally, WordPress policy has been to not encourage digging into the code
in the simple technical articles, but you are right that we need something
that will help Plugin developers hook into the quicktags/buttons. I'll take
another look at that, but I wanted to know the update on your request.

Thanks for keeping on top of these things!

There are plugin hooks for adding buttons to MCE, so I thought there 
should be an article. Someone is working on it... discussion going on 
inside the Hackers list... My thought was to put this in the section 
of the Codex for plugin developers (in as much as the Codex has 
sections), so I think we are in agreement there. It doesn't require 
hacking the core of WP, by the way.

Excellent. I haven't gotten the hacker's digest for the day. So I'll contact

Hi all,

Just wanted to follow up that a new style guide is up for people to review
and contribute to. Once we feel good about it, then we'll add it to under
this section:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines#Codex_Voice.2C_Style.2C_and_Audience

The style guide can be found here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:bsulliv3/style_guide

Many thanks to my co-contributors, Ani and Katy

Have a good night!
Bridie

I'm not sure I agree with all of the capitalization/usage ideas 
either. Did you take the non-WordPress recommendations from a 
particular style guide? If not, I would suggest consulting one that is 
considered authoritative. Some concerns I have:
    * Some style guides suggest always capitalizing Internet
    * I don't think "website" and particularly "homepage" should be 
written without spaces in them. I've never seen "mailserver" written 
as a single word.
    * Since all the other WP-specific items are capitalized, why not 
Blogroll?
    * How common is it to spell "email" with a hyphen? That seems 
outdated to me.

Just my 2 cents; I'm not an editor by trade...

There are also a couple of typos: (a) Under Link Categories, it says 
to "categorize" instead of "capitalize" both words. (b) Also near the 
bottom, the example for "checkbox" is missing the word checkbox, I 
think -- it should say "select the xyz checkbox".

In general, style guidelines are important, which is why I wrote them in the
first place. But they are not the rules. This is a wiki and therefore, some
slack will be had. Some things will not be tolerated, such as Wordpress
instead of WordPress as these are trademark issues, but I'm not going to get
hung up on website or web site. Seperate instead of separate - that's enough
to get my blood boiling.

These are good guides, but we don't have style nor grammar police hovering
over the Codex. I'm more concerned with content.

This doesn't mean the effort isn't appreciated or welcome. It means that the
job of Codex police is still open. :D

Thank you!!

Which Gallery are they talking about? Permalinks are addressed in the Codex,
though finding the information can be a bear but the link from the
administration panels helps. The new Media Library?

There are lots of "gallery" Plugins, and how those work is an issue for
those authors. Do you know what this person was talking about specifically?

They are referring to the new gallery feature in the media library.

If you add multiple images to a post you can then insert a gallery which
provides a set of click able thumbnails which link to the attachment posts.

coming out as soon as they have finished the release. Since things are still
in evolution, and what looks one way today could change tomorrow, we all
wait. :D

I believe this is all there is in the Codex as of this moment for

I don't deal with much in the way of user-facing documentation,

Since Gravatar inclusion is new, and we've been waiting to see exactly how
they are going to be included, we've been waiting and watching. Is all the
inclusion finalized?

Anyone on the docs list ready to take that on? Or I could ask Jeffro to help
us with the Codex article from the Weblog Tools Collection coverage.

I was goofing around with the codex to see what I could do and threw
this together, a rough draft/edit of the existing Gravatars page on
the codex (http://codex.wordpress.org/Gravatars)
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Sewpafly/Gravatars_2.5

I apologize if there is a better way to edit.  The content is
essentially pulled from Weblog Tools Collection's site, and I didn't
go overboard with formatting or content because I didn't know if this
was the right direction to take or not.

Subject: [wp-docs] "What's new in WP 2.5" doc?
Message-ID: <47E968BD.4040302@gunters.org>

I don't have a lot of time to spare for this message, so forgive me if 
I'm terse.

 From comments I've seen on my blog an elsewhere, there is a segment of 
current users out there who are put off by the new admin interface in 
one way or another. For example:

"I just checked out the demo site, and I am sorry to say that I don't 
like it, why you may ask? Headaches! I have like 9 blogs to maintain, 
and due to being familiar with the old version, I can't see myself 
switching. What happens to to 40+ plugins I now use, will most of them 
be unusable? I never did find the options page, maybe I gave up to soon. 
Just please tell me this won't be a mandatory upgrade!"

While your or I might think that it's an extreme or frivolous response 
to not upgrade just because the interface has changed, it's obviously 
important to this person. Obviously we aren't going to change the admin 
GUI back to the old style, so what do we do?

I suggest the creation of a "What's new in WordPress 2.5" document, to 
be present on the main website and/or Codex, and included prominently in 
the distribution itself, and presented (at least as a prominent link) at 
the end of the upgrade process. This document should have twenty-seven 
eight-by-ten color glossy screenshots of the Admin GUI, with circles and 
arrows, and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what it 
is[1]. In other words, a nice guide for upgrading users (maybe for new 
users, too?) which says things like, "If you're looking for the old 
'Options' menu, it's now called 'Settings', and it's located in the 
upper-right: [img]".

Even it if it doesn't make it into the release distribution, it would 
still be a good article, which I'm sure would get plenty of prominent 
linkage, if done well. If I had time to create such a document myself, I 
would. But I don't. And furthermore, I suck at that particular sort of 
documentation, so it would probably be better for somebody else to do it 
anyhow. So consider this a call for volunteers. Any takers?

I'm working on such a document, but it won't go live before the release.

The issue you bring up is a serious one. It's also one that WordPress
endures every time there is a major upgrade. Changes bring out the worst in
many. I know that many are hearing loudly the few who don't like it and
ignoring the many who do like it but are silent. Such is how it goes.

What truly makes a difference is not a document in the Codex but everyone
jumping on the enthusiasm, "I published first pics" band wagon, telling the
world about how easy, or difficult, the transition will be. The more
bloggers spreading the word about how to use it, the easier the transition
for everyone as their feed readers are filling with news and information and
how tos by everyone.

Right now, things are jumping in the design and I don't think anyone has
time to change screen shots every few hours or days, so if someone wants to
jump on this now, go ahead, but update the images when they change, please,
in order to ensure they match reality on the fast changing ground of
WordPress 2.5.

The rest of you, try out the beta release and get your screenshots up and
let the world know how to use it via your blogs. Grassroots is what makes
WordPress documentation even stronger. :D

Thanks. And expect a lot of changes in the Codex to accommodate the new
interface over the next couple of months. There are a LOT of changes to
make.

I think that's a good example of a page which has too many topics

I've cleaned up the article and removed instruction references to the
non-Automattic WordPress Plugins and I wanted to explain why. WordPress
Plugins change and evolve over time and maintaining these instructions on
the Codex has become a time consuming hassle, especially since we can't
track every Plugin mentioned in the Codex constantly and can't rely upon
Plugin authors to maintain Codex information in the Codex form and style. By
referring readers directly to the source, they get the latest information
and updates and we aren't libel for misinformation.

I left the information on the Automattic Gravatar Plugin as an example, and
because it is owned by the company, so we have a vested interest in keeping
that code up to date.

Good work on the additional information, sewpafly. I'll transfer the revised
article over the old one in the next day or so if you want to take another
look at the changes and make any adjustments. I simply changed a few
sentence structures to be in compliance with Codex standards, but you added
some good stuff. Thank you!

Message-ID: <fded39850803260615v1ce0d732mcac6a80825a6c747@mail.gmail.com>

Usually one or two volunteers automatically jump on the next version band
wagon and upload screen shots of EVERY detail of the new version changes to
the Codex. This one is going to be a big one, so can we have a couple
volunteers step forward as soon as the final version is released to create
screen captures?

Because there are so many, let's divide them by panel if possible. Here are
the image requirements:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Styles#Using_Images_in_the_Codex
Images as PNG or JPG
No larger than 600 pixels wide

We need full screens and closeups of individual parts and pieces.

These will be called upon from all the various documentation pages.

So who's ready and willing to start using their graphics program to get us
some good resolution screen captures? What panels do you want to cover?

Is this the article in question?

http://codex.wordpress.org/Gravatars

I would propose this as structure:

1. Brief intro and background
2. How to use get_avatar() in 2.5 and above, focusing on comment loop

(There's actually no gravatar() function in 2.5.)

3. Links to legacy plugins, and their respective docs
4. Links to how to build the URLs manually

  Usually one or two volunteers automatically jump on the next version band wagon and upload screen shots of EVERY detail of the new version changes to the Codex. This one is going to be a big one, so can we have a couple volunteers step forward as soon as the final version is released to create screen captures?

  Because there are so many, let's divide them by panel if possible. Here are the image requirements:

  http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Styles#Using_Images_in_the_Codex
  Images as PNG or JPG
  No larger than 600 pixels wide

  We need full screens and closeups of individual parts and pieces.

  These will be called upon from all the various documentation pages.

  So who's ready and willing to start using their graphics program to get us some good resolution screen captures? What panels do you want to cover?

http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Options_Pages

The above Codex page is no longer useful in its current state. It's
full of messy, insecure code (eg. no nonces) and does not conform to
general WP coding guidelines. I propose reverting it to revision 54048
[1] where it had good, clear documentation for creating Options pages
and where the code used lots of built-in methods for managing options.

I didn't want to revert it without asking if this was a good idea or
not. Opinions please!

John.

I haven't had time to go through it thoroughly and check out all the code,
but if you really feel that strongly, I'm game. Go for it. Let's hope you
have revert authority. If not, let me know and I'll do it first thing in the
morning.

Thanks for noticing and commenting on this.

Looking through the new page although it had more example code it was
less useful for encouraging secure well developed plugins.

I have reverted it back to the suggested revision.

Great. I added an intro paragraph specifying this is a WordPress
2.5feature. As soon as we get the team rocking on screen shots, we can
add
those to the article. Thanks, Matt!

I can muster some time to upload some screenshots...
Question #1: Should I just stake a claim say to Dashboard and Plugin pages?
Question #2: which parts need closeups?
Question #3: where/what interface do you use to upload the screens to the codex?

http://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_SubPanel is a new article for 2.5 and 
will be linked from the Administrative Panels article when 2.5 is released.

I'd guess anything where a 'graphic' will improve the explanation.

Use the Upload file link under Toolbox (on left or right of screen depending

Do we have any documentation on the Codex for using WP with screen-readers?
If not, and there's an interest, I'd be willing to set up an account and
trhow some up there.

With the release of 2.5, wordpress.org will be switching over to a new

shouldn't be too many changes, but I just wanted to let you guys know 
that the Codex will change at least a few hours after the rest of the site.

Amanda: That would be awesome. Especially with the new version. Please
follow the guidelines and let us know how we can help you with the article.

sewpafly: I charge you with Dashboard and Plugins Panels. EVERYTHING needs a
screenshot. Every link (within the context of the panel, not just a
'closeup' of the link) and full shots of the panel. Whatever you think is
necessary. See the examples within the Codex. We do full page versions
featured as thumbnails and closeups of the specific elements. There can
never be enough perspectives. But think technical and educational. If you
were instructing someone, step-by-step, on the process of using this, what
elements need visual representation to make the point of the "click here"
aspect of the narrative.

So that leaves the rest of the panels. Anyone else up for grabbing another
panel or three?

Great. I'll move it into the old document. Great job!

I've added a new example image near the top of the article and copied it
over from Sewpafly's user page to replace the old Gravatars article. Well
done! Thanks so much for doing this.

I'm really looking forward to updating the Codex to accommodate the new
features of WordPress 2.5. Thanks to all!

Sewpafly, you can delete your own user page version when you are ready. Or
let me know and I will. You are a star. Thank you so much!

Considering that I can't seem to find the 'delete' button, maybe you
better do that.

Thanks,

Done.

Only a few have the power to DELETE. It makes me feel god-like. :D

Thanks again!
