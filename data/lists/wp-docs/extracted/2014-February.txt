If anyone can help with this problem relating to the Persian Codex.

 

This page

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_action

 

when clicking on the Persian language link at the top should go to:

http://www.isawpi.ir/wiki/Function_Reference/do_action

 

but it renders this link:

http://www.isawpi.ir/wiki/Function_Reference%2Fdo_action 

 

Any help with this problem appreciated.  Thank you!

Hi Micheal,

I removed the use of {{urlencode}}, which was encoding the / character. 

http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Template:fax&diff=141357&oldid=141350

Removing that could cause problems if there are sometimes special characters in the links to the persian codex (like if the links sometimes use persian characters). But otherwise it should work fine. (The link was working for me anyway.)
