Hi y'all,

WordPress 2.3 is only a few weeks away, Sept. 24, and I'm hoping this
brilliant team can help us have some docu fun!

Maybe, a place to start is http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.3 and
creating more detailed articles linked from that content? I spoke to
Ryan and we can incorporate any of the post from his blog at boren.nu
.

Your thoughts? Where would you like me to start? Where would you like to start?

Cheers,

Some things that need to be documented for developers of themes and 
plugins:

  - new tag-related template functions
  - new filters/actions (and any old ones that are deprecated)

Probably there are other changes... ??

Absolutely! I can't tell you how un-friendly WP releases feel to me as a 
developer/web-monkey.When/if something breaks (and we know that's coming 
with 2.3/taxonomy/DB-changes/etc.) it's hours of research to find the 
tidbits of unorganized information available to allow a less-then-decent 
guess at how to address these 'bumps' in upgrading (was seriously 
thinking of just going on and on with that sentence, but, you get my 
drift err rant).

I'll take a look at Lloyd's linkage (sorry, BLOGROLL) and see if I can 
lend a hand(?).

Hello all,

I just signed up on the Codex and the mailing list and I thought I
would introduce myself.  I'd like to  start contributing a bit to the
documentation in between working on personal plugin projects.  With
the upcoming release of 2.3, I saw my chance.

I've been working on a plugin that enforces a 2-step publishing
workflow in WordPress.  The new 'pending' post status in 2.3 will
obsolete some of that work, but I think some of what I've learned
while writing the plugin could be codified into a 'Workflow Lesson'
based on the new 'pending' status.

I've recorded some of my ideas at my user page
(http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Scompt).  Any comments would be
gratefully appreciated.

Cheers,
Ed

http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.3

Well, I made my best attempt ;-) Help adding, refining, and deleting
content from that page is *greatly* appreciated.

I'm a better editor than author, and can't edit my own writing worth a cent.

Thanks,

Thanks for doing that guys! I was going to add some stuff other day, but 
didn't get to it. I checked it out last night, and it seems to cover 
everything I was concerned about. Again, great job! :) :D

Subject: [wp-docs] Adding a section for 2.3 on Codex main page..
Message-ID: <46F8FA19.7030009@gmail.com>

Just was wondering if someone would do this soon? Maybe add the 2.3 
section on the main page of codex? It's kind of a pain to keep resorting 
to 2.3 codex pages, via a text file with the links saved in it... =P
