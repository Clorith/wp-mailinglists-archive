Subject: [wp-docs] Codex in MediaWiki 1.5.7
Message-ID: <097b01c642fa$934270a0$6402a8c0@DELL8600>

With a little persistence, I've been able to get almost all of Codex into
MediaWiki 1.5.7.

The namespaces in the 1.5.7 database are (articles), Talk, User, User Talk,
Codex, Codex Talk, Category, Category Help, Template, Template Talk, Help,
and Help Talk.

I've not done anything with Images as that really needs a backup of the
current image folder before that can be accomplished.

The other thing that is not in this repository is the user login info in the
Codex database at MediaWiki version 1.4.8.  But, that may be a surmountable
problem.

So what's next?

WOW.
Seriously, that is HUGE work you must have done.

Subject: [wp-docs] internal linking problem?
Message-ID: <44276883.3000002@gmail.com>

I'm not a heavy contributor to the codex, and I don't watch this list 
religiously, so please forgive me if this has been answered elsewhere.

I noticed a few days back that it seem like the internal linking style 
of the Codex has changed, I'm guessing since the roll out of MediaWiki 
1.5.7.

If you look at my "desktop" 
(http://codex.wordpress.org/User:CoriSchlegel/Desktop) you can see what 
I mean:

    * A link I added before 1.5.7 uses the syntax
      [[User:CoriSchlegel/Desktop/get_settings|get_settings]] and points
      to http://codex.wordpress.org/User:CoriSchlegel/Desktop/get_settings
    * A link I added just a few days ago uses the syntax
      [[User:CoriSchlegel/Desktop/TinyMCE|TinyMCE]] and sort of points
      to
      http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=User:CoriSchlegel/Desktop/TinyMCE&action=edit. 
      By sort of I mean that MediaWiki seems to think that the page
      doesn't exist and thus provides the default "edit" link, but when
      you follow the link you get to my page in edit mode but with
      content.  If you go to
      http://codex.wordpress.org/User:CoriSchlegel/Desktop/TinyMCE you
      get the actual page.

As I recall from my own install of MediaWiki, there was a bit to do with 
friendly urls, but it's been a while so I don't recall for sure.  That 
was also 1.5.1 (I think).  Relying on that vague memory though, leads me 
to believe that the new Codex is using the not-nice urls by default.

Has anyone else noted this?  Is there a running discussion I haven't seen?

Thanks in advance for any insight...

Codex is still at 1.4.8.  I was able to move most of the contents, sans
Images and history, to 1.5.7 several weeks ago but that is a copy on my
local computer ;)

Under the User namespace you had the following documents:
User:CoriSchlegel
User:CoriSchlegel/desktop
User:CoriSchlegel/Desktop/get settings
User:CoriSchlegel/desktop/TinyMCE
User:CoriSchlegel/rants

It is likely the lower-case "desktop" that is causing your problem.  That is
an issue related to the fact Codex uses a setting that allows lower-case
letters in the first digit of an article name.  I don't know what the 1.4.8
setting is, but under 1.5.7 that setting is "$wgCapitalLinks = false;".  You
can see another example of the problem here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MichaelH/Wiki_Tips_and_Tricks#Linking_correctly_to_The_Loop

I've taken the liberty of deleting and moving the two lower case desktop
pages so they are now:
User:CoriSchlegel/Desktop
User:CoriSchlegel/Desktop/TinyMCE

I did not change your rants ;)

Regards.

OK, I see.  Works like a charm when you get the capitalization right ;)

Thanks a bunch!
