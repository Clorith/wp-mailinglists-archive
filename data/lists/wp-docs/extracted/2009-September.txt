First, http://codex.wordpress.org/Content_Visibility is now out in the wild.
I'm just now adding it to the main TOC but wanted to thank mrmist for the
great job and all who worked on it. Great work!!!

Second, just a personal note to everyone for your kind thoughts, get wells,
and patience during the recovery from my shoulder surgery. I'm still moving
slowly but hope to be back up to speed VERY soon. I'm tired of being locked
in a bed and pain! Anxious to be back at work full time! Thanks.

(Not sure if the Automattic folks actively watch this list, but I 
figured they probably do, and other users may have had/will have this 
problem)

I'm *sure* I'm the owner of the "rmccue" user, but I can't remember the 
password for it. I went to reset my password, but the email doesn't have 
appeared to have shown up in my inboxes.

Is there any way to get the email address for my user, or will I have to 
create a new account (and if so, could I have the user deleted? There 
are no contributions for me.

Thanks,

If you don't get a response off here, you could try emailing one of the 
codex bureaucrats 
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&group=bureaucrat 
from the "email this user" link on their user page. They have the 
ability to alter the users.

Subject: [wp-docs] A bit of nitpicking!
Message-ID: <a9c6d9300909280843n2db96bfdp2d0c7e18bcd96712@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I feel that the following two instances need correction:

1. Subject: <!--more--> Quicktag

The Codex page:
"http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_the_Read_More#Read_More_is_ignored_on_front_.28home.29_page"
says as follows:

"Read More is ignored on front (home) page

Please remember that on the home page ( is_home() == TRUE ), the
<!--more--> tag is ignored ..."

This is wrong since in WordPress parlance "Home page" (that which is
called in when is_home() == true) denotes the blog page showing the
latest blog posts.

This subsection is to be deleted or modified to provide instructions
in another set of circumstances wherein the More tag is ignored by
default and needs to become operative.

2. Subject: Tag cloud

The codex page:
"http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_tag_cloud#Examples" shows
an example snippet of code like this:

<?php if ( function_exists('wp_tag_cloud') ) : ?>
<li>
<h2>Popular Tags</h2>
<ul>
<?php wp_tag_cloud('smallest=8&largest=22'); ?>
</ul>
</li>
<?php endif; ?>

But the default formatting of tags in the cloud is 'flat' - tags are
separated by whitespace, and hence the enclosing <ul> and </ul> tags
become superfluous resulting in error while validating. For the
unordered list to be operative the "list" format is to be added to the
arguments.

Can I go ahead and try to do the correction, or, leave it to the experts?

Regards

S.K

Please make the corrections, that's what the Codex is all about. Some of
these are very old, so things have changed. We're constantly upgrading the
Codex to reflect the changes, but things slip through.

Thanks for paying close attention to detail and please, help us improve it.

Thanks,

Lorelle
