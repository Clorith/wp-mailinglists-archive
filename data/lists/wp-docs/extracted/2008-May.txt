Just for posterity on this thread. most people get the basics of WordPress
from articles they read and direct experience through WordPress.com, just
plunging in clueless. Then they want information. They find the Codex. I'd
love to have them start with the Codex, which is why we put so much energy
into WordPress Lessons and the basic introductory articles like:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress
http://codex.wordpress.org/New_To_WordPress_-_Where_to_Start
http://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Semantics
http://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Templates
http://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Template_Tags

We found that people were arriving with some of the basics known and
plunging into the deeper more complex issues. They'd end up on the forum or
our blogs and we'd point them to the basics and they'd go back and see these
articles. Circuitous route, but by the time they arrived at the basics, they
know much of this stuff. We served it up anyway and are now putting a lot
more energy into more juicy content instructions. Pointing them to these
basics, as Jennifer said, is critical to encourage them to put on the
parachute before they jump, but they jump first, think later. ;-)

The redesign I'm hoping to finalize in the new few weeks of the table of
contents should make these introductory articles more prevalent and  help
guide people to the right information more efficiently, while hopefully not
encouraging them to bypass the basics...ha! But I can hope.

The Quick Start is great, it just needs to integrate into the whole and
you're on the right track. Thank you so much!

The Codex is an interesting project. On the one hand, it seems like the
perfect way to create and share documentation. But from a user's point of
view, it's too massive and daunting to be very useful for beginners, in my
opinion. When users go to the Codex, they see 50+ links that point to
different pages and feel overwhelmed.

One thing I can't understand about Automattic is their lack of attention
about documentation. Sure, it's an open source project. But there are nearly
30 full-time employees, and the company has millions in funding. Isn't
Automattic is making a mistake by not adding a technical writer to their
team to create more useful help materials for the mountain of information
that is out there both on the forums, codex, and bloggers' sites? Shouldn't
there be a help button in the application itself (apart from the Codex
link)?

Don't take this as an insult to the wonderful content you've created on the
Codex. I'm just saying the Codex is a full-time job to maintain, and all the
useful info on the forums, the hacks and the unknown tips, should be
captured and somehow put into the Codex. There should be a printable manual,
or a more organized online help. The wiki is nice for collaboration, but
it's not so hot for including images, notes and advanced formatting that is
more common with help authoring tools and professional guides. Much is
outdated, or needs editing. Are there really enough documentation volunteers
to keep it up?

I agree totally with you, and the volunteers are working as hard as they
can. I'd love to get this whole thing moving in the direction it needs to
go, and working with volunteers to do that has been frustrating, it's true.
There is a lot of enthusiasm and not a long time commitment, though there
are some incredibly dedicated folks really pounding away at this - they are
the minority. Yes, there needs to be someone in charge of documentation, but
that's a decision for Automattic to make. For now, stay tuned for the
remaking of the TOC and I think the movement through the Codex will be
dramatically changed.

And thanks for helping us serve the beginners. I really want to expand the
WordPress Lessons area, so take a look there and at the guidelines for that
area to see what your gift for helping the beginners so beautifully might be
able to tackle. We need a lot of beginning how to articles on adding an
avatar (beyond the tech guide - very basic instruction), how to process the
Akismet comment spam queue faster, how to add images (step by step with
gallery tips), and so many basic tutorials. We also need videos and podcasts
attached to each.

I have time coming up that I've set aside to hack and whack the Codex, so
stay tuned for some great things. And I'll be calling for a lot of volunteer
help to get some of the new things done. Stay tuned and thanks for your
commitment.

And while you are at it, kindly tune the search algorithm of the
Codex. You never get what you want with the exiting search facility.
You may try with obvious terms and look at the results.

That will go a long way in making the life easier for beginners.

Thanks and regards,

Trouble is, the Codex runs on MediaWiki, which is a beast to modify.
Tweaking the search algorithm is virtually out of the question.

I see a potential solution (solution!?) in switching to Google Custom
Search (restricted to codex.wordpress.org) for the Codex search instead.

Message-ID: <e0e5ba500805080726i4c7118c2x1466f40466efb451@mail.gmail.com>

I've come across a minor issue in writing RTL text in the Codex.

I maintain the Hebrew translation of WordPress, and while trying to add a
Hebrew section about it in the WordPress Localizations section in the Codex,
I noticed the codex overrides all attempts to set text and RTL and
right-aligned.

This is the Hebrew section:

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language#Hebrew_-_.D7.A2.D7.91.D7.A8.D7.99.D7.AA_.28he_IL.29

I have manually set "text-align: right", but the Codex simply ignores it
when shown with the default skin. Other skins show the Hebrew section
properly.

I suggest adding a class such as "alignright" or "rtl" to be used for cases
like this.

Message-ID: <7e33d7870805141138ud1c6d16ta3d9cfa74fe57867@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working with other Japanese WordPress users & localization team to
establish our "official" Japanese documentation site. After long
discussion including the idea of using a part of codex.wordpress.org
resource, we decided to move to SourceForge.jp hosting.

We figured that it's the best solution at least for now, because of
some custom structure and templates we want to use, as well as
availability of 100% Japanese interface (menu, search, help, etc.).

Anyways, I am wondering if the MediaWiki skin for codex is available
for use in other language's official documentation site that is not
hosted on wordpress.org. It would be nice for consistency of the look.

And another question: if codex is going to be rolled out to localized
sites in the future, can we have (for example) ja.codex.wordpress.org
domain assigned to our sourceforge.jp site?

Both are not critical for launching and maintaining our documentation
site, but I appreciate it if you could share any information related
to this topic.

Thank you,

Subject: [wp-docs] Differences between Template Tags and Functions
Message-ID: <483E24A2.7020308@santosj.name>

I know to some degree if you start speaking about programming, then most 
would be developers would start tuning you out very quickly. However, 
the term is not accurate when a developer starts looking at code. The 
terms, "template tag" and "function" are the used in the same context.

Well, that is to say Template Tags are functions. It is to also say that 
not all functions are template tags. Just because a function can be used 
within a template does not make it a template tag.

While I was editing wp_count_posts() Codex page [1], I noticed that it 
is under the Template Tag category. However, it is not within one of the 
*-template.php files, it is in the post.php file. This lead me into some 
confusion, as most functions, which would be referred to as Template 
Tags are within the *-template.php files.

I would move the page, but I'm a n00b to the Codex, so I dare not 
displease the gods. In my opinion, it should be. Am I wrong with my 
assertion?

It also leads some confusion with a co-worker and myself. We both 
thought that Template Tags are majority used within The Loop, however 
this might be narrow thinking on our part. Doing some checking, any 
Template Tag can be used outside The Loop easily, well it would take 
some global hacking in order to do so.

My question is, where do you draw the line between functions (which 
developers look for) and template tags which non-developers look for?

The border line is indeed virtually inexistant. I would say: let's keep it 
the least confusing for inexperienced developpers (who are going to look 
primarily at the codex), while more experienced coders will also dig a bit 
around and look into the source.

My proposal for: what a function needs to qualify as a Template Tag :
- being located in one of the *-template.php files
- echoing something, not returning something
- having a "non scary" self explanatory name (the_category(): ok, 
_usort_terms_by_ID(): not ok)

I think this would be the most natural classification for beginners.

(Therefore, I think wp_count_posts() does not deserve its "Kiss Me I'm a 
Template Tag" badge, sorry!)

Cheers,

Good explanation. I plead guilty to starting that as a Template Tag article. 
I've moved that to the Function Reference section [1].

Ozh et al: maybe we should add this brief, coherent, and logical 
explanation to the Template Tags article in the Codex, as well as the 
Function Reference, or maybe just in the Function Reference (since 
that is more apt to be looked at by dev types)?
