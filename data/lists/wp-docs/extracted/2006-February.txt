Message-ID: <43E07EC9.5040200@mullenweg.com>

I've been seeing a lot of posts similar to this:

http://simon.sp8.org/2006/01/31/wordpress-v201/

"Don?t ask me how, but I wish the upgrade process was easier, didn?t 
involve de-activating plugins and deleting files. The install is 
embarassingly easy, in my view its time for the upgrading to be the same."

There is a balance between being ridiculously thorough and not 
overwhelming people. I think we weigh towards the latter right now.

That comes from the code.

Authors need to tell people to wrap their fucntions properly. It has
been posted before. It also means that the core fail more gracefuly - a
theme problem right now causes a blank screen and a post to the forum
for instance.

The 'official' instructions have never said to delete files, and have
always said to overwrite. The deleting came about because of very high
levels of overwriting problems. It's written to save posts.

With respect Matt - the upgrade docs are as thorough because of two reasons:
1 - How the coders put it all together
2 - the people doing the upgrade

I have certainly written what I have because of forum questions and far
too many personal emails at these times. It's not been for fun.

What we really need is another article: How to make your upgrading
easier. For instance, wrapping every function call in if()statements.
Again though, plugin authors need to play this game too.

Also, what about graded instructions - literally the 'short version' and
the 'long version' ? A changelog version can be figured out by the
individual themselves.

It's also possible to write a generic upgrade doc from which all others
can be quickly built.

Interestingly, just after the 2.0 release, Mr. Sharma wrote
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Carthik/Five_Step_Upgrade that recommends
deactivating plugins but overwriting files.

Can we come to a consensus about this (i.e. deactivating plugins and
deleting files)?

I don't see how it can happen.
Deactivating and deleting takes longer but is reliable.
Deactivating and overwriting does cause problems.

And deactivating plugins makes not a jot of difference unless the actual
function call is wrapped.

It's too big an issue now - so all instructions must take into account
the needs of the person. And bear in mind that the people are more
likely to be reading these things are the ones that need to know the
most and the most reliable. Step 1-2-3 may not fit with the '5 minute
install' but then people have got nothing to lose there have they ?

In the end though, if WP could, after being uploaded, deactivate
everything, delete or at least checksum each new file and rectify then,
and then do something about plugin code it would be approaching
something close to the upgrade nirvana.

As it stands:
Write one decent document and that helps far more people than brief
instructions and it also saves forum traffic. And it's not exactly
tricky to write.

The upgrade documentation is fine, though it would be easier to have a
list of files that SHOULD be deleted (not just a list of those to KEEP).

It's kinda the upgrade PROCESS that's a pain. Deleting files is scary
for Joe User. It would be ideal if the files could just be overwritten.

Here's a plugin idea... a plugin that would take a snapshot of the
activation status of the plugins on the site, and then batch
activate/deactivate them. Read on...

I see it like this:
* User activates the "PLUGIN MANAGER" plugin.
* Within "PLUGIN MANAGER", user creates a 'snapshot' of currently-active
plugins.
* Within "PLUGIN MANAGER", user clicks a 'batch deactivate' button to
deactivate all plugins at once.
* User deactivates "PLUGIN MANAGER".
* User upgrades WordPress.
* User activates "PLUGIN MANAGER", clicks the 'batch activate' button
and viola! -- all previously-activated plugins are automagically
reactivated.
Easy, fast, and user-friendly.

It's not just the plugin authors that need to do this.... theme authors 
need to take responsibility for that as well. IMHO it's not fair to hold 
the plugin author responsible for something the person who wrote the 
theme/template (who, for all we know has been warned by the plugin author.

Personaly, I always deactivate plugins before doing anykind of upgrade. 
You just never know when something in the core has been changed that is 
going to cause conflict with a plugin. I too have also been plagued 
(sporaticaly) by the overwrite problem. This despite my telling my FTP 
client to overwrite all files. For what ever reason it doen't always take.

Sure, I wish there was an easier way. It would be so cool to be able to 
login to my WP admin dashboard see a big fat link "UPDATE AVAILABLE!" 
and I could click it, and the changed files would be downloaded and put 
in to the correct location, and BAM! the upgrade is done (except for 
maybe running the upgrade.php to get DB changes). But I don't hold any 
hope that 1) it's possible, or 2) that it will ever get done.

Solution: I don't know. I don't really have one. But I do subscribe to 
the philosophy that better to be safe than sorry.

Both suggestions are made to work around external problems.  Files are 
deleted because people have a high tendency to upload files incorrectly 
and incompletely.  Plugins are deactivated because so many of them do 
things that pretty much guarantee that they will break whenever WP 
internals change.  Personally, I use rsync and a few carefully selected 
plugins and can upgrade all of my sites with a single button press. 
That's not typical, of course, but it illustrates how easy WP is to 
upgrade when you have the proper upload tool and don't use crackheaded 
plugins. :-)

While I haven't been active on this list in a while, I must say I've 
been pretty happy with the ugprade process.  I've had far less problems 
upgrading WP than say, Mediawiki, which I've managed to break for days 
during upgrades on occasion.

However, I also tested the upgrade for each site on a server that 
mirrors my production server and essentially started from scratch, no 
overwriting.

That said, what about a command line or web based upgrade/downgrade 
script that does a full backup of db and site, disables plugins, and 
handles all the overwrite/delete issues gently?  The idea would be that 
it basically spits out a default themed WP instance with plugins 
disabled, but with all the old data so you can go back and start turning 
things back on and seeing what breaks.

Of course, a user who would use this probably knows enough to handle the 
upgrade pretty well on their own.  It would still be useful.  I'm tied 
up until late Feb so I couldn't work on this, unfortunately.

Seems like WP is experiencing the same sorts of growing pains as PHP has 
experienced -- it is used widely in a variety of environments by a 
variety of users with different skill levels, oftentimes users a bit in 
over their heads.  From a strategic standpoint, seems to me like the 
best strategy here is simply to continue support for the 1.5.x branch 
and *not* rush users into upgrading.  A user who is annoyed they aren't 
in a position to upgrade is *not* a user who is furious because they 
just nuked their beloved blog.

The column on th right can be done without, in my opinion. The width
of the column for the article itself is very narrow on my 1024x768
screen. Looks like the designer used a widescreen machine, or one set
to a very high resolution.

It would be nice to remove the wiki-maint links for someone who's not
logged in, too, since one needs to login to edit anyways.

I'd guess anything in http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference is fair

Matt,
When I'm faced with a question like that, I decide aftr asking myself
three questions:

1) What complete subset of the problem will I be able to finish with
minimal effort (so that I don't leave an incomplete work-in-progress 
behind)
2) What complete subset of the problem will be most useful to the most
people when it is completed?
3) What problem will I have the most fun finishing?

Replace problem with task, and you have the perfect way to answer the
question :)
The superset (of which there are subsets) could be "writing
documentation for wordpress" or something with a finer granularity,
like "writing function references for all wordpress functions".

Regards,
Carthik.

Message-ID: <85efe87a0602131234p245f612bnf7cc3c97620e9ad8@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to have a wiki page for Akismet.  The Akismet.com site itself
is much more broadly focuses and has little functionality for low
level end-user interaction.  The wordpress forums have answered some
great questsions, but they are scattered and buried.  Here is an early
version:

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Here/Akismet

I'd like to move it out of User namespace, but wanted to inquire as I

pages their own space, as [[Akismet]] , but the existing structure
tends toward subpages for Plugin related materials (as
[[Plugins/Spam_Tools]] at

One of the following will likely work, in order of my preference:
[[Akismet]]
[[Plugins/Spam_Tools/Akismet]]
[[Plugins/Specific/Akismet]]

Any thoughts?  Unless determined a Bad Idea, I will move it out of my
userspace and change references to Akismet to point to this page

I'm not sure plugin specific stuff belongs on the codex.

My personal preference would be to put it here on dev.wp-plugins.org and
akismet's source is hosted there e.g.
http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/Akismet

It could go under my user page if it really bothered people, but since 
it's bundled with core it'd probably help more people in the root.

Carthik's page is much simpler and less scary, maybe it could be made 
even more so? I think the principle is to have a simple and short page 
by default, and a more detailed one if people want it.

I tend to agree that a root [[Askimet]] page is warrented,
particularly as this is bundled with the core.  My own echo of Peter's
uncertainty about plugin specific content on codex was the reason I
posted.  However, a page on the trac wiki would not help end users
nearly as much as information available on the official documentation
wiki.  Without further objection I will move the page to [[Askimet]]
on codex and link relevant references.

Step 3: Overwrite Files

errors. I give up.

What's the risk of overwriting? I've never encountered 'overwriting

WordPress is different from others...

It isn't so much a WP problem, but we've seen issues where the FTP 
client doesn't properly overwrite the file when it should. I've 
experienced it from time to time. There have been times where despite me 
telling it to "Overwrite All" .... it doesn't...and there doesn't seem 
to be any rhyme or reason for it.

It's no so much WordPress, as it is the hosts on which WordPress runs.

_Sometimes_ for _some_ users, copying a new file over top an old file
produces problems.  The site breaks, things don't work, whatever.

In almost all of these instances, deleting the original file first, and
then copying up the new file, solves the problem(s).

So the instructions to "delete first" were added to ensure a consistent
approach to trying to prevent this problem in the first place.

Risk ? None.
Hassle for users when they get errors because their server screws up ? Yes.
Forums helpers tired of saying "Delete first" ? Yes.
Time spent in forums doing so ? Lots.
Time to alter 1 doc and keep it that way ? Seconds.

Would it hurt for the 'official' docs to say 'Delete' ? NO.

So if the user uploads an ARCHIVE of the latest release of WordPress and
extracts it, overwriting (but not deleting) existing files, the
potential problem is avoided altogether?

This speaks well for a script that automagically checks for and
(optionally) downloads & installs newer versions.

If every user has the right access to do that, possibly.
I'll bet the _vast_ majority do not.

Yes, but the whole point was to trim the install doc down from saying 
delete this, this and that, oh, and make sure you don't delete your 
wp-config.php file. Upload the new files then go on. How many other 
projects tell the users to delete the whole install before uploading the 
new files? None that I can think of.

Maybe what we need is a "recommended" ftp program and have it documented 
to say what the settings should be in the codex.

Simple management:
Say it once or Say it dozens and dozens of times.
I'll pick the former.

What this _actually_ comes down to is trying to portray WP as some magic
app that only ever needs 1-2-3 to work no matter what or where it works
because it's just so special. For many that may work. For many it does not.

I actually thought that Codex was there to take load off the forums.

It doesn't matter what other apps do or do not, what matters is that
every single time WP goes up a version we get a glut of errors caused by
failed overwriting. It's not rocket science to make a connection is it ?
Overwriting = possible errors = user frustration = forum use

Maybe we should start answering with
"Upgrade error ? No idea .... did you follow Codex ?"

Actually, if the upgrade documentation SPECIFICALLY said what files to
delete that would be better, IMO, than saying, "Delete the wp-content
directory, being sure not to delete your xxx sub-directory under
wp-content". If a user doesn't pre-read (and Lord knows that most of
them do NOT), they'll miss the exceptions.

I've never seen an app that instructs you to delete everything first. I
know that WordPress is special; I don't understand what's special about
it that requires me to delete instead of overwrite.

What is the estimated percentage of installations that encounter the
"overwrite issue"?

WordPress is not special.

I've no idea.

Here's an idea:  Strike the "delete" instructions from the official
upgrade guide.  Then everyone who's complaining about the verbosity of
the instructions should commit to spend a week on the support forums
helping people when the next upgrade comes out.

If you're objecting to the instructions, then please commit to helping
deal with the consequences of their removal.  Thanks.

I'm sure I can find pages in Codex that affect far far fewer people.
Why the objection ? I can't understand it - myself and others have been
answering this question for two years now. If we didn't think this was
worth doing do you think I'd be writing now ?

I will continue to tell people who have problems what they really should
be doing, and Codex can wander along it's merry deluded little way.

Taking only a minute to think about it.... but for the number of times 
I've upgraded (all the way from .72 days to 1.2.3).... I've probably had 
this happen to me five or six times..... out of a dozen or so. But 
what's weird is that it happens on *some files* and never always the 
same ones, it's a different set each time.

Whether it is me, my ISP or my FTP, I've never been able to figure out. 
What is so wrong about deleting the files? Granted, it's just one more 
thing to do, but if it saves hours of agony.... then it's worth 
90seconds to run the delete.

What would be wrong with a 10 minute upgrade, vs a 5 minute.  Is there
competition out there that WP is trying to "beat"?  I'd rather give someone
more detailed instructions and it have a lower percentage of error, than the
short and sweet, and then see their frustration level go through the roof,
and start bad mouthing WP for being too "hard", and posting threads,
"HELP!!!! UPGRADED VIA CODEX, AND MY BLOG IS
BROKEN!!!!!!PLEAZEEEEEE!!!!HELP!!!!!!!!"

Besides the Overwrite issue, are there any other problems with the 5-step
instructions?

If there is other incorrect information in Codex, please list that so it can
be fixed.

Here's a thought, and call me crazy if you want.... include the delete 
files step in the codex directions.... then as a caveat to that 
direction, include a link to another Codex page that asks and answers 
the question "Q: Why am I told to delete my files." A: Because it has 
been our experince over the last few years that FTP clients are not 
always reliable in actualy overwriting files and some may retain their 
old code. ... etc..."

Just a thought... Could also be x-referenced with the Upgrade FAQ (if 
there is one.)

I am not replying to any one question in particular, hence the
top-posting of this reply.

Every operating system/system software has quirk and special cases on
different platforms/user setups. Official documentation should deal
with the most general case, dealing with special cases that are more
troublesome specifically if required. This is the case with all
documentation, everywhere. A windows installation/upgrade guide or
movable type upgrade guide (just examples) do not try to explain how
to install/upgrade it on EVERY system, but instead just focusses on
the steps involved, in general.

In general, the idea behind every WP upgrade is that files need to be
_replaced_. Overwriting is in general, the accepted way of achieving
this. Some setups may require deletion and then uploading -- BUT -
even this is not a solution.

I personally help upgrade around 20+ wp installations. One user who I
help with administration used the previous upgrade guide and dutifully
deleted all the wp-* documents in the root folder except for the
wp-config.php file. His upgrade went poorly, since there was a
subscribe plugin that had a wp-foo.php file in the root folder. This
wouldn't have happened if he had overwritten files, instead of
deleting and upgrading. This is a special case where the
"delete-and-upload" philosophy turned out to be worse than the
"overwrite" approach. Does this make you lean towards "overwrite" now
that you know this? I suppose not.

WP support and documentation are such difficult problems in general
due to the scope that we define for ourselves. A user who does not
know the basics of hosting a website and adminstering a user account
(her own) on a server should not expect to get lessons about the same
from the documentation for a web application! If that hasn't sunk in,
what I am saying is the equivalent of "User documentation for gmail
should not include instructions for installing a browser" and the
like.

There is no reason to feel bad about saying "sorry but that is outside
our ken". The sooner we learn that the better. At least, the official
set of documentation resources should not be crippled by this. Setting
a modest goal (for documentation) is not a crime.

About the upgrade guide - what I wrote was a draft - you can update it
with links to address the problems posed here. Support volunteers can
refer people with upgrade problems to the more detailed guide and
request them to follow that on their restored backup of the
un-upgraded wp install before proceeding further.

What right does Carthik, who does not spend ANY time on the forums
have to lecture us about support, you ask? Well, I have been there,
and I stopped going there from when the number of issues, and the
kinds of user questions I was assumed to be responsible to support
outgrew my interest. Remember - this is all voluntary, and the people
who put the most into support have probably gained more from it than
people who haven't.

Giving up on improving something, and finding an acceptable via-media
compromise is negative. I will take my shot at improving the guide for
which I am responsible now.

Last point -- the usefulness of user documentation approaches zero as
the length of the articles increases beyond reasonable need. Just like
an over-cluttered UI, or too many options, this turns people off,
terribly. So lets keep the essence easily available, and the details
available for only those who need it.

Sure, put the burden on the support forums.

Did I? All I said is lost, for no good purpose, if that is what you
got out of it. I can repeat it, just so I get it right -- it is NOT
the support vols' burden to deal with users who cannot follow
instructions. Support Vols can direct users to the detailed upgrade
guide, and expect them to use it before asking any more questions. If
users can't take the extra effort to get things working, support
volunteers need not go out of their way.

I was trying to anticipate what you might feel after you read what I wrote.
It would be great if you were more verbose about what offended you
(or, is it just me who's obnoxious?)

Yes, in my opinion.  And rather than get into a pissing match, as you've so
pointed out, this is voluntary, consider me done with this issue, this mail
list and consider me done with answering questions in the forums.  I'm tired
of the division between the forum and codex, which in my time, goes back to
last summer and Lorelle's rough shod control over what, where, how things
went into the codex.

The obstacles in the forums these days in answering questions is great
enough, to have more put up by some ego trip of what shouldn't be included
in an upgrade page is absurd.  So go on dealing with the least common
denominator, and leave the others to fend for themselves.
Good Luck.

That is a first - I suppose I can say with confidence that I have
tried to be considerate to all opinions, and be extra careful to
explain myself on public mailing lists, just so that I am not a
"troll" or someone who easily offends. I'm sorry I was obnoxious.
I can state my point of view, and argue rationally, but I cannot
counter invective.

That said, Michael, you are more productive and useful to others
around here, than me, right now. Please don't give things up because
of me.

I am not a part of the picture. I itched and I scratched, but I did
not expect this result - at all. I have been inactive with WP for a
while (since January), which is why I asked my name to be removed from
the blogroll, and Matt did that, and removed my name from the
wp.org/about/ page too. I just didn't see the need to make my private
decision public before. I felt VERY self-conscious writing the
previous email, which is why I explained why what I was writing should
not offend support volunteers who spend time at the forums (when I
currently don't). That seems to have had the opposite effect. Looks
like there is nothing I can say to discuss issues without upsetting
someone emotionally. I am currently not worth you stopping work on WP.

> And rather than get into a pissing match,
That has NEVER been my intention, not in this thread, or any other.
Please don't accuse me without first knowing me.

You should not discourage volunteers, no matter what you *feel*. Use
your reason, not emotions to explain what you think is right, and to
get it accepted. Lorelle never exercised rough-shod control. No one
did. The period you speak of is from when I was in the business of
helping out at the codex. This source of information that many are
proud of, that many refer to, was the answer to the dig "wordpress is
really cool, but it doesn't have good documentation". Michael -- I
have spent more hours (than probably two or three people I shall not
name) at work on the Codex that anyone else, including you. Yet, I
have never been possessive or protective about this work.  I'm sorry
you seem to think otherwise about me, Lorelle, and maybe others.

This is NOT an ego trip. This is a rational conversation.

Have you seen my edits to the page (which I made as I said I would in
the previous mail)? Do you agree to what's there? If not, how can we
improve it?

To bring the discussion back to a potential worst-case upgrade process --

1) follow simple instructions (including full backup and overwrite) -- FAIL
2) delete all files, keep directory structure
3) follow long instructions, but instead of deleting everything /but/
select files -- start by uploading only the select files.
4) upload new wordpress version -- FAIL
5) forums

if we begin with the detailed instructions:

1) follow long instructions, deleting everything /but/ certain files
.. (for me, this is annoying -- and even tricky, causing failure and
frustration)
2) upload new wordpress version -- FAIL
3) forums

-------------

The 10% (probably higher) of users whose upgrade works using the
overwrite method will be giddy, the 90% of users who have to upload
the specific files they need will complete everything in an extra few
minutes.  I don't see this change will resulting in significant
increase in forum traffic.

Everyone,

I hope this doesn't inflame things further (sorry for not stepping in
before), but I find it amazing so few people here accept that a brief
upgrade document cannot mention both overwriting and deleting as user
options.

Step 1 is broken down into two individual steps (which really makes
this a six step guide, but let's not quibble) while step 3 is a single
paragraph, less than 100 words. If we can give up another 100 (150,
maximum) to the art of upgrading, I'll tackle a rewrite on this which
informs both overwriting and deleting, while stepping around concerns
over possible user confusion about the two.

Are we fine with that?

I _very_ much doubt that the upload will only work in 10% of cases. I
imagine it to be more like 85%, 90% (although I don't have any figures
to go by).

Codex is likely to be ported into a WordPress like format using the blicki

Developers are asking for input into what functions and wiki markup should

Please make your comments and wishes known or add to this list:

Why? Is it just to make it easier to update the theme across 
wordpress.org, or are there other reasons?

Someone more "in the know" feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I 
think it has to do with problems with the MediaWiki code. There's 
something special about the Codex that's keeping us from being able to 
upgrade to newer (faster, safer, etc.) versions. Plus the devs would be 
more comfortable hacking on something WP-based.

* We're working on a wiki plugin anyway
* User system integration across WP.org (one login)
* Performance
* Upgradability (no one has been able to upgrade the current codex)
* Possible new functionality

As has been discussed in several WP meetups, it's going to be up to the 
docs group whether to make the change or not. I'm sure lots of people 
will find a wiki plugin useful regardless.

If we have a vote, then I'd say stick with Mediawiki and find out why Codex
can't be upgraded.

So, to put my money where my mouth is, I will pay a bounty of $350.00 US to
the first person who upgrades Codex to MediaWiki 1.5.6 before April 1, 2006!
Two rules:  the dataset you upgrade must be done from the current data and
you must warn this Email list, in advance, you are doing the actual upgrade,
so we can halt any edits of Codex until the upgrade is completed.

I would take up on that offer. The biggest problem is that most of us
don't have access to the database, or the codex php source. When Matt
said "many have tried", I assume it was the WP devs (Matt, Ryan)
and/or some other webhost pros that tried and failed.

If I recall correctly, the most significant problem is that all wiki
pages don't have a /wiki/ prefix - this I learnt from some mediawiki
devs when troubleshooting some image display problem at the codex.
This is an installation error, and sometimes I think that with
mediawiki's documentation, it is a wonder the codex is working at all.

So MichaelH, without access to the codebase and the database, the
offer is crippled :)

Can we get a tarball of the database and mediawiki instance?

Two other caveats:  1) If they do it ON April 1, I think the person 
deserves a booby prize.   2) If *I* do it, can I please pretty please at 
least demo a version where the design doesn't put the wiki functionality 
in a sidebar but instead runs it across the top as tabs?

Mediawiki 1.5.6 comes delivered with these skins:
Simple, Monobook, MySkin, Classic, Cologne Blue, Nostalgia, and Chick.

The Monobook has the article, discussion, edit, history, protect, delete,
move, and watch as tabs if that's what you are talking about.

You can also get that now in Codex under Preferences, Skins.

I'd say the more skins the better ;)

I have sent it to trusted people before, for example skippy, but I'm not 
going to post it because it contains people's login info.

Michael, I appreciate your enthusiasm for MW but you may also want to be 
a realist.
