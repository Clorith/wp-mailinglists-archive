Hello,

Today I checked to make sure I was still on the list, because this
list is so quite.

Is anyone leading any active projects for WP Docs?

Thank you,
Lloyd

I know Matt and Ryan were talking about moving Codex from MediaWiki  to the
bliki environment.  Don't know what the status of that is.  Codex is still
running on Version 1.4.8 of MediaWiki.

MartinCleaver and Andrea are adding some WPMU stuff.

There's some Forum activity related to enhancing/changing the FAQs--miklb
was driving that bus last I read.

Since Lorelle got "blown-up" over the possibility of writing a book about
WordPress last September 28 there hasn't been a real big push on any other
project.

Regards

I've tried to update/add where possible, plus have developed a pretty long list of things that need
to be updated/changed where the information is out of date (like refers to v. 1.5.x specific
things/etc) - problem for me is time, as far as just digging in and getting things done. 

I don't see any real good reason for putting any time/effort into changing platforms (other than
possibly to update/upgrade the mediawiki version), seems to me that any time/effort should be
focused on getting the right info in the right places, not what platform the thing is running on.
Plus, I think more people are more familiar with using MediaWiki than there are bliki folks out
there.

That bus took a detour the past week, but it's still high on my list of
todo's on the free time side of things.  I've collected links, and put
thought, just not  gotten the actual  ball rolling.  But the FAQ was less
for the codex, and more for  themes/templates forum of @support.

They were too busy at first, but when I pointed out that they speak
now or forever see awkwark language in WordPress, Vera Horiuchi was
able to find some time.

'"Compose' sounds a little strange to me.'

'Call it "Editor". People are accustomed to the phrase "text editor."'

She thought the title of 'HTML' for the other tab was fine.

Thank you,
Lloyd
