Subject: [wp-docs] Nomenclature for WordPress interface
Message-ID: <429EF019.3030802@myrealbox.com>

Some time ago Carthik asked me to come up with standard terms for parts 
of WordPress's interface, for use in WordPress docs 
<http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-March/000170.html>. 
Unfortunately I was buried in work at the time, and never replied.

However, now that I'm paying my tithe for this wonderful software (half 
an hour copyediting the Codex per day), I've been reminded of this while 
looking through the Codex pages on WordPress administration, which use 
the term ... "SubPanel". They look like good docs, but the terminology 
could use some work.

So, just as a suggestion, how about these.

WordPress control panel ("control panel" where the context is obvious)
     The combined set of administration pages. Example: "When logged in
     with an account of type X, you can delete comments directly from the
     article page where they're posted, or in the WordPress control
     panel. To delete them in the control panel, go to '''Manage'''
     &rarr; '''Comments'''."

Control panel menu ("menu" where the context is obvious)
     The navigation items in the control panel. Example: "Once you turn
     on this option, a new 'Uploads' item should appear in the control
     panel menu."

Page
     Any of the administration pages. Example: "On the '''Plugins'''
     &rarr; "Plugin Editor" page, click the plugin you want to edit.
     (Caveat: "The Write Page page" is a bit clumsy, but I think it's
     still better than "The Write Page SubPanel".)

Section
     A part of a page with its own box or group box. Example: "In the
     '''Manage''' &rarr; '''Categories''' page, find the "Add New
     Category" section."

Field
     A text entry control. Example: "The description you enter in the
     '''Description''' field will usually be displayed on your category
     archive page, if you have one."

If these terms don't seem very exciting or innovative, then good -- 
that's the idea. :-)

I would suggest "click the 'Manage' link then click the 'Comments' link"; "Click the 'Submit' button", etc. instead of just "Choose 'Manage'" or "click 'Submit'".

Could you explain why Administration Panel and SubPanel don't strike  
your fancy?  This isn't meant as an offense, it's just that you  
dismissed SubPanel with the implication that it was obviously bad  
(i.e. without any explicit reason).  I don't see anything wrong with  
the term (though I'm biased; either I'm an early adopter of it or I  
coined it - I don't recall).  I'm just curious about your thoughts.

> Page

I'd avoid any use of the word "page" at all cost (hence the panel  
terminology).  It's already confusing from a user's standpoint (Page  
as is Post v. page as in webpage).  I realize that's exactly what the  
administration section is - a bunch of pages with which a user  
controls his or her site, but consider talking about the Manage Pages  
Page or the Write Page Page...  (ah: in re-reading I see you've noted  
this already.  My tastes say that Write Page SubPanel is better than  
Write Page page :) )

Will people recognize "field" as an input?  I have no clue if people  
will or not.  Is textbox not well understood/not user friendly?

I'd have to agree with MDAWaffe on the "Page" comment.  I had a fiddle
in the Codex and it could lead to some confusion.  It would either
need a massive rewrite of the documentation to check for ambiguities
with "Page" if we moved ahead with this terminology.

I tend to stay away from User Pages in the Codex unless they are suspicious 
or I have to leave a note or need information, but MichaelH found this 
during one of his rounds as the official Codex greeter and I had to share it 
with you all.  It's wonderful.

There was a group of us here in this discussion and in the IRC chat for 
#wp-docs that spent a lot of time discussing this and hashing it out.  We 
now have a series of documents on the codex that deal with the semantics of 
the names, including http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Semantics, the 
glossary, and...MDAWaffe, I thought that your Terminology was moved out into 
the main docs....ANOTHER ONE LOST ON THE USER PAGES....hrmmmm.  Must do 
closer inspection of those.

Anyway, while I personally did not agree with all the choices, the jargon 
was set.  It may evolve and change over time, but right now, it's set as it 
is. There is some interchanging of words for "panels" and "screens", but for 
the most part, the language is now more understandable than it was when we 
began.  Much of that thanks goes to mdawaffe who worked overtime to create 
the great http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels pages that takes 
the user inside of each element, describing all the different parts and 
pieces of the WordPress Admin. Just click the "What Links to This Page" and 
you will see how critical this kind of documentation is, especially for the 
beginner documentation.  I think we're vested in the current terminology by 
now.

That page was never meant to get rolled out into public view.  I meant it
as a voting booth and discussion area while we nailed down the
terminology.  It can still be (should still be) used for that if there's
more bits that need to be defined.

Another page, such [[WordPress Semantics]] and/or the Glossary, is a
better place for the public eye.

Matthew,

Thank you,

I think MDAWaffe has a point about using the term "Pages" (not using
it, rather).

Maybe we can all rally around the page MDAWaffe created, making
changes as seen fit, and finalizing it, so everyone can be asked to
start using it.

Lorelle, the page MichaelH created is more for explaining terms
used/seen in WordPress to newbies and users, in general. We will need
to start using a standard set of terms to describe the various
graphical elements in the adminstration screens/pages/panels and
include that in that document.

Carthik.

Message-ID: <012001c56877$3a0b1950$6402a8c0@DELL8600>

New FAQ pages are being developed on Codex, but the automatically generated
Table of Contents (TOC) at the top right of each FAQ page gets a bit ugly.
See an example here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MichaelH/FAQ_Layout_and_Design

Lorelle has somewhat solved the problem by issuing a div
style="clear:both;height:20px"></div> but that really doesn't work. See an
example of that here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MichaelH/FAQ_Installation

TOC of choice, at least for the designated FAQ pages,  would be floating top
left.  See an example of that here:
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction

Manually creating a TOC to handle this would be possible, but requires
double effort each time something is changed or added.

Any help or suggestions very much appreciated.

Carthik, others, and I have been working for months on getting a better 
"look" for the front page of the Codex.  I'm not talking about the styles, 
skins, themes, or the overall design of the Codex, but the table of contents 
that greets users, and the sub-table of contents pages that sorts all the 
documentation.

After experimenting with a lot of different looks, we finally put forth a 
"vote" of a couple design layout choices in this past IRC WordPress Meetup 
and the decision was made to go with a three column layout for the front 
page, resulting in the examples found at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle#Codex_TOC_New_Look.

We'd like to have your review and comments on these. And if there are some 
documents missing from the different lists, please add them carefully (the 
coding for this is solid but easily messed up) or post them on this mailing 
list, or add them in the discussion page.  You can also post comments there.

There is talk of a new style and new wiki format for the Codex as a whole, 
and we don't want to make the changes to the Codex very drastic, so until 
then, this is a little step on the way to the next bigger step.

Thanks,

Over time, these external links have been compiled into a new reference 
"article" on the Codex at http://codex.wordpress.org/Technical_Articles.

If you know of a solild resource for information about WordPress, it would 
be great to have that information put into the Codex as an article, but 
until then, please add it to this document to provide more information for 
users.

If you are writing about a topic in the Codex, you can also link to any of 
these sections to provide more information from external sources, if you 
want.

I think the new pages look really good, I think they're a lot friendlier 
to someone visiting the Codex for the first time and organize the

Part of the reason Mediawiki scares me so much is even though we're 
forced to upgrade because of security issues *the database upgrade 
scripts don't work*, so our DB is out of line with the software, which I 
imagine is causing errors like this.

into your language, we have:
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Localization aka redirected from 
Localization, and others

For information on how to help get WordPress translated into another 
language, we have: http://codex.wordpress.org/Localizing_WordPress aka 
redirects from Translating WordPress, and others.

What we have are too many names for two documents, and too much similarity 
in the names.

This is what I think would work better, based on the documentation that is 
there, and it involves help from others more knowledgeable on the subject to 
help expand these documents to help users.

1. WordPress in Your Language - Introduction and list of WordPress help, 
forums, installs and themes available in which languages.
2. Installing Translation Files - Step by step instructions on how to 
install installation files and customize them, if needed.
3. Translating WordPress - Step by Step instructions on how you can help 
WordPress with NEW translations of the WordPress core, themes, Codex, and 
setting up a WordPress support forum in your language.

I can separate them, but we need help cleaning these documents up and adding 
relevant and up-dated information. There are now some plugins out there to 
automatically translate WordPress posts into different languages and these 
need to be included by maybe having another page on how to have your site 
"be" in multiple languages.

Thanks.

Codex Cleanup Week June 18-26
Cleaning Up for the Summer

WE NEED YOU.

You signed up to help expand the documenation that supports WordPress, so
now is the time to call in all favors and set aside time during the week of
June 18-26 to help the WordPress Community clean up and expand the WordPress
Codex.

We've created a huge list of things that need to be done on the
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks Task list.  There are things to do
for the novice and the expert. We need simple cleaning, editing, tag
checking, example checking, verifying, and new articles.

To sign up: Codex: Cleanup http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Cleanup
List of Things to Do and Sign Up For: Task List
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks
Guidelines: http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Contributing
Need an Assignment: Leave a Message with Carthik or Lorelle
    http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle
    http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Carthik

High on the priority is cleaning up copyedit marked articles and the new
FAQs.  With a lot of time and effort, the FAQ from different sites have been
all gathered together in one place and we need to get these checked to make
sure that if the answer applies only to version 1.2 and not 1.5, it says so.
More instructions are listed in the Task List.

If you have not signed up for a task, and you are looking for an assignment,
check with Lorelle or Carthik for your assignment.  We would love to "give
it to you". ;-)  Let us know what you are able to do, expertise-wise, and
we'll find something for you to do.

We're going to make an announcement on the WordPress Forum to recruit more
volunteers, so we still need people who want to take responsibility over
different areas of the Codex to help monitor those activities.

You got involved to give back to WordPress, and now is your chance.

Carthik, Lorelle, and the rest of the WordPress documentation team thanks
you!

Subject: [wp-docs] Tags - feedback please ?
Message-ID: <42A93796.2020307@tamba2.org.uk>

Caveat - I just woke up, this will have holes in.

1 - Name Tags
Would it be possible for people to tag posts with their name, but for 
only them to see that ?
Would this enable a feed based on their name tag ?
I know this overlaps with the member list, but that records all activity 
and they could use the tag to select only those posts they wish to 
follow more closely.

2 - I think if all this is a Yes, we could do with a "Tags ?" sticky for 
users.

3 - Closing completed. I have pinched this from another forum
"This thread has been Resolved and has been locked to prevent other 
users hijacking the thread and to help others know which threads have 
been Resolved and which are still being worked on.

If you started this thread and the problem returns or the case has not 
been properly Resolved, please send a Private Message to an 
Administrator or a Moderator of this forum to have the thread opened 
again. If you have a different problem, please start a new thread."

I like that - though the language could do with altering slightly. The 
overall message is good.

How about this:
- Mod sees that original issue has been answered
- Mod adjusts tags / title if needed
- Mod adds a "Completed" tag
- Mod closes thread
Over time, a list of "Completed" threads would appear - definitive 
answers if you will.
Now ..... remember the old forum where we could see how many 'views' a 
thread had had ? That would be useful with these tags as it could 
indicate a documentation need ? Yes / No ?
First issue I see with this is that the good answer could be surrounded 
by wrong answers so posts would need deleting to create the desired 
result. This is interfering with the forum in a basic way which I'm not 
entirely comfortable with but if the process was transparent to all it 
should be okay.
Second issue is that threads will have to be marked as complete when 
feedback from the OP has not replied. What to do then ?

Time for a coffee :)

What if instead you could add a topic to your "favorites"?

I chatted with Michael about this and he's going to see about adding a 
status field for topics that the original poster or admins can set, 
answered, unanswered, or not a question.

True, I'll see about collecting these stats again.

In preparation for a forthcoming event, I am doing some backup guides.
I have access to Ensim and Cpanel. Relle will allow me access to the 
vDeck she has.
If you have Plesk or any other cpanel type thing, can I have access please ?

I will install WP, screencap a backup through whatever backend your site 
uses and then delete the install I created. That's it.

The resultant work will be on my site as a standard webpage (and under a 
CC License) and also on Codex for the event.

If you've any questions, just ask or otherwise drop me a line ?

Also, podz, try emailing Mark Ghosh. I suspect he has a server with Plesk on it.
mark-at-wltc.net dinki-at-mac.com etc should work.

Message-ID: <42B24AE2.3020207@cameraontheroad.com>

Wow, it's here!

Codex Cleanup Week begins Saturday, June 18 and runs until June 26.

We have 17 people officially signed up, though others are contributing 
and helping that aren't on the list. This week has been amazing already 
with people pitching in to help before the official start date. Spelling 
has been pretty much cleaned up, categorizing the documents also 
started, and a lot of new documentation has been added. WOW!

Vandals are also sneeking in and out so we have to watch things to make 
sure nothing slips in during this busy next week.  Would all sysops and 
lead members of the documentation team take extra time this week to 
stomp on bad folks and help any of the new volunteers stay on track, 
please?  That would really help.

The Codex Task List is long and filled with plenty to do and we need a 
lot of technical help with these articles and the ones listed in the 
STUB and Copyediting categories.  With everyone's help, we can get a lot 
of work done this next week and then go play this summer.

Thanks in advance to everyone who is and has donated time on this 
project.  It's really exciting to see all the energy and enthusiasm!

Over a week ago, Podz came to me with a brilliant idea.  Let's connect 
the dots between the Codex and the Forum. I quickly put together a few 
posts that highlight articles in the Codex, based upon the Featured 
Articles list we put together a few weeks ago for the new front page of 
the Codex, and started posting those, one in each section on the Forum.  
Podz "stuck" them and they will stay at the top of the charts for the 
week, and then new ones will be posted on Sunday nights.

With recommendations from some of the Codex volunteers, I put together a 
few more "featured articles" for the forum posts for the next few 
weeks.  This also puts pressure on us, the volunteers who work on the 
Codex, to get these featured articles smacked into shape.

There is a list of the articles highlighted in the forum posts at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Forum_Post_Features and we need 
everyone to poke around and make sure these show off the best face possible.

Thanks to Podz for the brilliant idea and to everyone who contributed 
and edited (and will edit) these documents.  They are great and worth of 
attention.

I know this is going to really annoy people, but right now I'm not bothered.

If you are running the latest 1.6 (it's the one with the 'Do Not Use' in 
the version) AND you are blogging about it and what it offers AND you 
are not making it crystal clear it should not be used, would you be so 
kind as to drop by the forums to answer the inevitable rise in questions 
from people to also get that code and their blog breaks.

After what has happened in the past, and the steps taken to make getting

No, you should not be emailing anyone if you run into trouble, and should 
not be asking for support at all since is unsupported. Thus is the reason 
for this thread.

Honestly couldn't tell, cause I've seen so many people say similar things

Kidding aside, why would you suggest that anyone help alpha users in
the forum when it says quite clearly (if not grammatically) on the
Nightly Builds page that "The mailing list is the only place
appropiate for support on nightly builds, please do not use the
support forums or any other lists"?

Because people don't read warnings; and lots of poeple feel they have 
some sort of entitlement to support, regardless of any admonishment 
elsewhere.

I think more of the reason was the post specifically requested that the ones 
who are running 1.6 and openly advertising their doing so need to go support 
on the forums, because ultimately its people who advertise running "Do not 
use" software that lead to every day users trying it out and then posting 
for support on the forums. Really though, requests for 1.6 support should be 
closed with a note saying "If you need help, don't use it."

Apologies - I should have been clearer.

There are people on the forums who have not yet upgraded to 1.5.1.2
In the forums we are still working - in some cases - with 1.2
The very very last thing we need to see on blogs is people saying how 
cool ANY features in 1.6 are. Those sort of posts lead to non-coders 
downloading the code, upgrading their blogs then yelling becaue things 
break.
It will also lead to people saying "Should I upgrade to 1.5.1.2 or wait 
for 1.6" and it definitely increases the pressure and anticipation for 
the next release.

We do not need this hassle, really we do not. If you are going to 
discuss it, please make it abundantly clear that it must not be used 
unless you want a broken blog / can write PHP in your sleep.

If no-one answering posts in the forum is using 1.6, then what do we do 
? Berating them goes only so far, and given the nature of the code and 
the huge amount of changes that appear to be planned I think it's only 
responsible to keep any talk of 1.6 to the appropriate lists.

No, you should not be emailing anyone if you run into trouble, and should
not be asking for support at all since is unsupported. Thus is the reason
for this thread.

The purpose of my mail was not to stop people discussing the features 
that will arrive (or not) in 1.6. It was not to stop people using 1.6 if 
they are happy to take those risks and also keep quiet if things go bad. 
I know WP has to develop and I know that the better the testbase the 
better the code should turn out to be.

But, the forums are - for want of a better word - staffed by few 
compared to the number of people seeking help. When earlier versions 
were in development, despite the fact that there was a Beta forum, 
people chose not to use it. Despite the fact they were using development 
code, they still complained when things went wrong for them. That period 
of time was one of massive frustration for Craig and myself as every 
other question was about code that we may not have been using and as 
things went, code that changed hugely.

As soon as 1.6 becomes available in an easily got to download, there 
will be a buildup of pressure.
Plugin authors will get pressured (for instance: spam plugin that works 
with 1.6 ?)
There will be the inevitable speculation about templates / themes and 
all that subject encompasses
People will stretch that code and look for answers everywhere they can 
and even if we had a dedicated forum it would go the way of the Beta forum.
And in the meantime there will be people still asking for help with 
their officially released code. We cannot tell people to upgrade to the 
latest code - that is not feasible. But those asking for help for 
official code must not have their needs swamped by the vocal few who 
have tried the cutting edge and found it hurt them.

I don't know about the wider OSS community, but I know the release 
history and forum effects. We ought to run a book on the first time we 
have to say "When it's ready".

Well the people doing that *probably* aren't on this list or the hackers 
list. People here know better. Since a subset of people will cause 
trouble no matter what pre-emptive measures what we do, what can we do 
to make responding to them less frustrating for you? Maybe a Codex 
article that you could link to and then just close the thread?

I don't know:

- Delete posts. see above
- Provide support. Not an option.

I like the idea of pointing to a Codex article, and then locking the 
thread.  I'll gladly help moderate these "problem" posts.

What about put a highly noticeable disclaimer regarding support for
unsupported version and the latest supported version is xxxx. If you are
running a version newer than xxx you may not get any support.

Maybe change the version from "alpha-do-not-use" to
"unsupported-alpha-use-at-your-own-risk"?

1.3 was never a stable branch, and I believe everyone has just dropped
1.2and moved on, just because backporting fixes would be a large
hassle

If your hardening guide consists of telling people to upgrade to the 
latest version, then that'd be great. Anything that recommends people 
stay on a old version is a negative impact to security.

Well, that's why I wanted to know if any older stable branches had
backported patches and all.  I didn't think there was anybody doing that,
so in the draft I've written that there users should run the most current
version available, absolutely no excuses.

I do say that if someone had the time and resources to actually handle
security upgrades for older stable WordPress branches, they could start
such a project.

The hardening guide has other advice (about passwords, encryption, file
permissions, etc) and describes some common classes of attack that a
WordPress user could face.

Really, for such a relatively small project and the nature of the software, 
backporting patches to older versions has no clear benefit. It creates 
problems for support people with having to support two majorly different 
versions at the same time. And is there any true benefit to not upgrading? 
Unlike some major projects, like the linux kernel, supporting two branches 
is not worth it, because the upgrade path is not hard or time consuming.

I feel very strongly that there should be a page for all CODEX

If the WP code is important enough to have it's contributors listed,

There should be one license for the entire body of work.  That license
is the GPL.  If someone does not agree with that they shouldn't
contribute to codex.  The same as with the WP source.

> If the WP code is important enough to have it's contributors listed, 
> then surely Codex is no less deserving ?

Sure.  Such a list can be generated from the changes list.  Since
everyone is making changes under their own user name,  attribution is
tracked by the wiki.  Due to the wiki, we have better attribution
tracking for documentation than we do for the WP source.

No copyright assignment is required, so everyone retains rights to their
contributions.  Contributors retain copyright to their changes and agree
to license them under the GPL by putting those changes on codex.  This
is the same as with someone who gives us a patch for the source tree.

You must be careful with attribution under the GPL.  Distributors of a
GPLed product cannot remove copyright headers, but they are not required
to keep vanity links.  Requiring vanity links and advertising clauses is
a violation of the GPL and every other OSI (Open Source) approved
software license.

IANAL.

Interesting point about 'one licence for the entire body of work'.

Good question.  I don't know what, if any, license applies  to the
forums.  It's different than a wiki where you are obviously making a
contribution to a corpus of work. I wouldn't snip someone else's post
from the forums and stick it in the codex.  Not without explicit
permission to use it under the terms of the GPL.  Maybe Matt can chime
in on the forums.

You will have to ask that on the hackers mailing list.  We just talk 
about boring documents here.

Also, be advised that your article, since it wasn't first set on your 
User Page while you worked on it or marked with a DRAFT notice, has been 
edited and revised per Codex policy.  They have also left questions and 
information on the discussion page you may want to check.

Thanks,

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex Cleanup Half Way Status Report
Message-ID: <42BB2A27.1090601@cameraontheroad.com>

Whew!  The week is half over and the Cleanup Team wanted me to give you 
all a status report on the activities so far. The following information 
is "of the moment" since momentum is picking up and we can barely keep 
track of it all.

* Tasks List
 Arbitrary New articles (brand new, not revised and fixed): 15
 Arbitrary Tasks Completed (new tasks, not ongoing efforts): 13

  We call these arbitrary because they are the ones "caught" and
  recorded. There is a lot going on very fast here and the cleanup
  team is working hard to keep up, let alone count it all.

* Since Wednesday, June 15, several days before the start of the cleanup 
week, people were already starting to pitch in.  While exact numbers are 
hard to estimate, it looks like about 2000 changes have been made to the 
Codex since then, maybe more. Will probably be about double that by the 
middle of next week.  A lot of cleaning by the cleanup team will happen 
next week to clean up from the weekend.

* While 19 people "officially" signed up, many more signed up for 
specific tasks and made offers of help via the IRC Chat #wordpress-docs.

* The Task list has been cleaned up to only show the lists of items 
awaiting activity and signup at http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks.  
The accomplished tasks have been moved to the discussion page: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex_talk:Tasks

*Especially important has been the list of new articles submitted to Codex
including these contributions with more on the way:

Accessibility
Add Link SubPanel
Adding Asides
Administration Panels in Plugins
Alphabetizing Posts
Blog by Email
Hardening WordPress
Moving WordPress
Using Javascript in WordPress
Coloured Quicktags
Creating Admin Themes
HTML to XHTML
Styling for Print
Using Gravatars
WordPress Cookies
Link Manager - complete rewrite and revision

* While everyone on the Cleanup team has worked hard on this, special 
recognition needs to be given to the "categorizing team" who categorized 
EVERY one of the more than 400 articles on the Codex. The categories are 
coordinated with the main table of contents and listed at the bottom of 
every page. This will help increase the connection between related 
documents and improve user friendliness in the Codex. It is a huge, 
boring task and kudos to them for plowing through it all.

Summary
As it stands now, the Codex Cleanup Week has been a resounding success. 
Many goals set for this project have been accomplished:

* Increased awareness of the WordPress Codex as a resource
* Improvement of the reputation of the WordPress Codex as a valued resource
* Increased connection between the Forum and the Codex
* Increased volunteer activity on the Codex
* Increased documentation
* Improved checking and verification of documents from a "team" and not 
an individual resulting in documents released faster and better quality 
assurance
* Improved communication
* Development of a task list for directing volunteer efforts

Again, thanks to everyone.  We are just at the half way mark and there 
is plenty more to do.  Get out your brooms and dust pans and start 
cleaning up the Codex with us.

I just noticed in my install that all the 'help' links point to wp.org:
http://wordpress.org/docs/reference/post/#title

Other pages have no links yet they generate some forum posts.

It would seem that there could be some useful codex linking that could 
be done, and possibly those links be highlighted in some way ? It took 
me ages to realise that the Title (as linked above) was actually a link 
and not just an underlined title.

As this involves core code, how best would this be tackled ?

Links to articles on the Codex from the last couple versions have been 
to pages which can be edited by only a certain user level and they are 
blocked from being moved or renamed.  So the pages on the Codex are 
protected.

The "articles" or docs on the wordpress.org/docs sectioin are ancient. 
Many refer to 1.2. I sent Matt an email over a month ago per his request 
with rewrites of many of them referring people to pages on the Codex, so 
he or whoever coordinates those pages on the main site can copy and 
paste, edit a little, and they are ready to go. They are in HTML tags, 
so it is a simple matter to copy and paste. If the tags need to be 
stripped out for their inclusion, I can deliver the content tag free.

Any page on the Codex linked to from the program can be protected, which 
answers your question. We just need to know which pages.

Docs Team,

It has come to my attention that some people want to create a list of 
IRC users on the codex. It has come up that users would have to be 
asked, who would take care of it, etc.

My facts, there's about 25-50 users in the forums and irc that are on 
often and are very knowledgeable about wordpress. Nobody knows who's 
trustworthy (as noted in http://wordpress.org/support/topic/37482).

Ask the users, have users add their names, that way its their choice. 
Delegate somebody who's in irc all the time to keep the page clean of 
users who aren't often helping in irc or other such mediums. Instead of 
editing a irc users page, how about creating a support page with a list 
of people who can be trusted.

Also, another gripe was about self promotion and links to users pages 
and sites... well what about your Documentation team page 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Documentation_team  Isn't it one sided to say 
that hey, we can have a page that lists OUR names but anybody else is 
self promotion? (yes, my name is on there, but it has been for a long 
time and depending on the outcome of this, I might remove it.)

Let's clean up this request a little so everyone understands.

A request has been made to permit those who participate as support 
providers on the IRC channel to have their names on a list on the Codex, 
possibly similar to the Documentation Team's list.

I asked the two people interested in this to submit a request to the 
Documentations Mailing List to approve such a list since it's 
implications and needs go beyond simple documentation.  The old wiki had 
such a list, though it was poorly maintained.

The issues before us are:

1. Should such a list of "IRC #wordpress Members on the Codex be of 
value? How will it be used and referred to?

2. Do we need to assign someone to monitor and maintain such a list?

3. If the IRC channel gets such a list, shouldn't such a list be 
provided for the Forums and Development Teams?

4. Should the list be a list of names, names with links to user pages on 
the Codex, names with links to email/web pages of these people, or their 
name with their IRC nickname next to it and that's it?

5. What will it "mean" to have your name on the list? What 
responsiblities will be taken? Should these responsibilities be outlined 
like "Lorelle - Codex" or "Fred - Plugins" so people will know what 
these people "specialize in" when they visit the IRC?  And then will 
this mean they have to "ask" for that person's help or are limited to 
only getting help from those people?  We need clarification for the 
purpose of the list.

This is getting as bad as work, everything has to go through a 
"procedure" to be added to the codex. C'mon people we're not dealing 
with Sarbanes-Oxley here. There doesn't need to be strict regulations to 
add a page to the codex. This is a community around a open-source program.

All that was asked for was a simple friggin list of users who are often 
found helpful in #wordpress and http://wordpress.org/support/ Lets not 
have the double standard of the Docs team can have a listing but anybody 
who isn't can't list their name even though they're a community 
participant/leader.

One question, one proposal.

Question: Isn't it enough to have wpbot knowing about people? If one is
unsure, ask wpbot about the "definition" of the nickname in question. It
would be easy to extend the definition with realnames, if people wish so.


If not, we come to my proposal. Lorelle asked about "responsibilities",
you (Ryan) mentioned trustworthyness, both in context with such a "IRC
users list". So I'd like to suggest to make use of a mechanism provided
by Freenode: groups.

The Freenode IRC network knows so called "groups", which are officially
represented in Freenode with one or more channels. This could be a
company, a user group, a "software project", ...

One of the goodies provided to such groups is a "project cloak". A cloak
is a virtual hostname which appears instead of the real hostname in a
user's session. Such a cloak provides protection against attacks from
script kiddies (who would need to know the IP address of a user, which
can be retrieved by knowing the real hostname of this user), and it
allows to represent an affiliation between a user and a project.

Example: I'm usually online in Freenode and OFTC. If you run whois on my
nickname (otaku42) in OFTC, you'll see something like:
=== cut ===
--- [otaku42] (~otaku@dsl-084-058-132-217.arcor-ip.net) : Michael Renzmann
--- [otaku42] #kernelnewbies @#linuximq #lartc
--- [otaku42] xenon.oftc.net :Waltham, MA, USA
--- [otaku42] idle 00:37:38, signon: Mon Jun 27 07:46:49
--- [otaku42] End of WHOIS list.
=== cut ===

The first line contains my real hostname, which can easily be resolved
to the corresponding IP address. It's easy for someone to launch attacks
to this IP - which fortunately doesn't happen often, neither in OFTC nor
in Freenode.

In Freenode you'll see something else:
=== cut ===
--- [otaku42] (otaku@otaku42.developer.madwifi) : Michael Renzmann
--- [otaku42] #wordpress #madwifi-devel #madwifi #freenode #asterisk-dfn
--- [otaku42] sterling.freenode.net :Hoofddorp, NL, EU
--- [otaku42] is an identified user
--- [otaku42] idle 01:01:27, signon: Mon Jun 27 07:46:48
--- [otaku42] End of WHOIS list.
=== cut ===

Here the first line doesn't contain my real hostname, but shows a
project cloak. Trying to resolve that cloak to an IP will fail, since
the TLD madwifi does not exist. In addition a user can determine my
affiliation with the project "Madwifi": it seems I'm working as
developer there.

The "TLD" is fix ("madwifi" in the above example), everything else is
the choice of the project. For madwifi, we have:
* "xyz.user.madwifi" for people who use our software and are regular
visitors in #madwifi
* "xyz.support.madwifi" for people who offer their help in supporting
other users with their problems
* "xyz.developer.madwifi" for core developers

WordPress might could also have "xyz.docs.madwifi" for members of the
documentation team, or "xyz.wiki.wordpress" for the Wiki wizards, and so
on. Again, that's completely the choice of the project.

Another goodie is that Freenode reserves channel names for the project.
When the group registers with Freenode, it also specifies the name of
their channel. In case of WordPress this would surely be #wordpress.
This automatically reserves all #wordpress-* channels (#wordpress-docs
and #wordpress-meetup would be automatically protected), so they can't
be blocked by a third party.


Now you might ask what has to be done, and what obligations follow out
of registering as a group.

Group registration establishes an relationship between the group and
Freenode, by indicating that the group has an official presence on
Freenode. Groups have to name a contact (one or more persons), which
acts as connection to Freenode. For example, in case of problems with
one of the group's channels these person(s) will be contacted by
Freenode staff to clean the problems.

Apart from the above there are no obligations. No need to sponsor
anything, no need to pay fees, no need to maintain the relationship for
a given time.


Bottom line: registering as group with Freenode and maintaining the
"affiliation" by handing out project cloaks for people might be a good
way to let users know who is officially affiliated with WordPress. Given
that cloaks are not handed out to everyone who pops into the channel
once or twice, owners of a wordpress-cloak could be regarded as being
trustworthy. A list of currently online group members can easily be
retrieved (for example: "/who *.madwifi") - this would be a list as
desired, being maintained on and delivered by IRC instead by a non-IRC
media.


More information regarding "groups" can be found on the Freenode website:
http://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml
http://freenode.net/primary_groups.shtml
http://freenode.net/about_groups.shtml

I think "primary group" might be the right model for WordPress.

Since the bots all allow other people to adjust your definition, I don't 
think this is a very reliable option.  Also, what happens when a bot is 
offline?

Okay, so that explains the hostnames I've seen!  Thanks.

I think there's independent value in having a WordPress group on 
Freenode, if for no other reason than to secure the #wordpress-* 
channels.  But I don't think that hostname cloaks will provide much 
reassurance to the average user looking for help.  Sure, some folks will 
understand the signifigance, but not many.

Moreover, what criteria will be used to determine who gets a cloak, and 
who doesn't?

Relle and I had discussed this some more and put it on the Meeting notes 
for Wednesday's meetup. Firstly to find out if Matt has registered 
#wordpress on freenode or not, currently it sounds like not. Secondly 
about cloaks, and thirdly about giving voice to users who have been 
around a long while and are very familiar with wordpress. This would be 
an even more visual sign to users that "hey, +Skippy must be 
knowledgable, he's at the top of the list with a few other users. We 
would have to nominate x amount of peopole for this and then ask them if 
they would like the responsibility. It'd be nice to have a list of ~10 
all the time. I know matt has been against ops/voice for a while, but I 
think it would help the project in terms of people being able to get 
support.

Another suggestion for the forums (when BBPress gets there) is to tag 
certain users as administrator or moderator either with or instead of 
"janitor prime" and "support maven" because new users don't know who can 
be trusted and thats not clear to somebody that podz is a moderator and 
ryan boren is a dev. We'll bring it up on Wednesday. Any other 
suggestions can be brought up here or left in the notes for the meetup.

I see Michael has created this, but I don't understand why the irc users 
didn't just do it anyway :)

Security issues as posted are thankfully rare. Had one of many other 
people got there first and said "send it to me" I and I'm sure others 
would have backed them.
The issue goes both ways too - when I do stuff for people, I have to be 
confident with them too.

You will have people who will skip the forums and fire off emails to 
everyone on that list because no-one else on the planet has had this 
incredibly obscure "headers already sent" error.

Labels.
Labelling people as "the guy who knows rewrite rules" or "the guy who 
knows sql" is okay except:
- you increase the burden on them as people turn to them directly. Ever 
seen the posts in the forum with "Podz - help!!" ? I find those 
extremely embarrasing and it's also as good a signal as any to others 
that their answer is not wanted.
- let's say we don't have a "Rewrite rules" expert. We've just 
highlighted that to everyone haven't we ? Is that a good thing ? Did 
that just hang out the "Vacancy" sign ?
- and giving someone the label - what if they leave ?

Forums.

Again you lead to people being targeted. This is not me being against 
such a move but I have been bombarded in the past by support requests by 
email and IM. Not just the odd one or two - many emails per day. That is 
a hurdle for the individual to get over.
It also implies that certain people cannot be trusted which is not the case.
The forum "staff" (for want of a better word) has always been kept 
small. Right now, excluding Matt and Ryan, it's Carthik, Skippy and 
myself. To 'promote' someone purely on the fact that they can be 
'trusted' seems fairly weak. The need in the forum for trustworthy 
people is far outweighed by the need for people who know what's what, 
where things are, a good amount of history and a willingness to go in 
there every day and answer the same questions over and over. That alone 
is good enough for me.
Clearer distinctions ? maybe, but then it's down to the individuals 
concerned to act consistently and honestly - I have never hidden the 
fact that I can't and don't code but it doesn't stop me finding someone 
who can.

As for a list, you may also have the typical effect that the person at 
the top gets lots of mail, the one at the bottom does not.

I would just create the list wherever, not limit it to #irc - because 
there are perfectly good people who do not use that medium - and have a 
very clear warning at the top - caveat emptor and suchlike. We also have 
to be crystal clear that ANYONE can add themselves. We can't start any 
sort of exclusivity club.

There is already a Wiki page about the IRC channels, iirc. Why not
adding the necessary information to interpret this information to it, or
to some FAQ?

> Moreover, what criteria will be used to determine who gets a cloak, and
> who doesn't?

>From the point of view of Freenode: that's totally left to the group.
The group contact files a cloak request per user for the Freenode staff
and they will create/modify/delete this cloak ASAP. Apart from the need
that the "last element" of the cloak needs to be the name of the
group/project (here: maybe wordpress) and the same for each of the
group's cloaks, the rest doesn't matter. If the contact asks for
creation of the cloak "i.am.damn.cool.cuz.i.love.wordpress" this would
be technically ok.

>From the point of view of the group it may make sense to follow the
hierachical model of DNS. The more right an element of the cloak is, the
more "general" this element is. Elements on the right group together all
the elements left from it.

Think of WordPress in an hierarchical way and you might come up with
something like:

WordPress
  +-- Development
        +-- Core
        +-- Plugins
        +-- ...
  +-- Documentation
        +-- Wiki
        +-- FAQ
        +-- ...
  +-- i18n
        +-- Europe
              +-- Germany
              +-- Italy
              +-- ...
        +-- Asia
        +-- ...
  +-- Support
        +-- Forums
        +-- IRC
        +-- Mailinglists
        +-- ...

and so on. Someone working in the german i18n team then may have a cloak
like: user.germany.europe.i18n.wordpress

Of course, this is bloated, and the real organizational scheme most
probably would differ, so take this just as an example. It's left to the
project, and many projects choosed to have not too complicated cloaks.
The more differentiated the cloak name scheme is, the more complicated
it will be to find which cloak a person might get - many people help in
different "oranizational units", so which one to pick for the cloak? You
get the idea.


It might be interesting for such a decision to get an idea on the cloak
scheme used by other projects. This is relatively simple.
http://freenode.net/primary_groups.shtml has a list of all primary
groups, with their primary channel name in the first column. This name
normally is used for the cloak as well. You can use the /who command to
see what users of each of these projects are currently online under
which of the project's cloaks.

Example:
You want to find out about the phpBB project. Locate the project in the
primary group list. You'll see that their main channel is "#phpbb"
(noted without # in the list), hence the project cloak most probably
ends with "phpbb" as well. Now change to your IRC client and type "/who
*.phpbb", which just gave me:
=== cut ===
--- #phpBB Chaz Caedmon.moderator.phpbb irc.freenode.net Caedmon H@ :0 Chaz
--- #freenode ~graham GrahamJE.moderator.phpbb irc.freenode.net
GrahamJE|Away H+ :0 GrahamJE
--- #phpBBmod smithy_dll smithy-dll.modifications.phpbb irc.freenode.net
smithy_dll H@ :0 David
--- #phpbbstyles ~NeoThermi NeoThermic-student-pdpc.support.phpbb
irc.freenode.net NeoThermic H :0 NeoThermic
--- #wordpress SHS SHS.moderator.phpbb irc.freenode.net SHS` H :0 SHS`
--- #phpBB ~adam AdamR.support.phpbb irc.freenode.net AdamR|Away H@ :0
Adam Reyher
--- *.phpbb :End of /WHO list.
=== cut ===
The second column of this "space-seperated list" contains the username,
the third column the hostname (= the cloaks). As you can see, the phpbb
group decided to use at least: <user>.moderator.phpbb,
<user>.modifications.phpbb and <user>.support.phpbb. There might be
other "sub-groups", but no user that might belong to such groups is
currently online.

Another thing that regulars should do: register your nicknames. This way
it's much harder for malicious guys/gals to grab the nickname of a
well-known wordpress affiliate, join #wordpress and saying bad things
there. It's easily possible to proof if someone has identified to the
Freenode network when s/he claimed to be the person that nickname
belongs to. Furthermore one can protect the own nickname from kidnapping.

If desired, I could help in case of questions regarding the registration
of nicknames on Freenode.

Having ops permanently online in the channel is "a bad thing [tm]". This
raises desires for becoming opped/voiced. Voice may be an alternative,
but IMO having voice only makes sense if there is a chance that the
channel becomes closed for non-voiced users. This in return would
require someone being available to have enough rights to change the
channel modes - which might or might not be the case at a time, but
always will depend on Matt (as the owner of the channel) to give the
necessary rights to anyone else.

An interesting read in this regard also is:

After all that discussion one question comes to mind: WHY do we need to
have a list of people who can be trusted? Trusted in which regard?

Maybe that should be stated clearly before talking about ways to manage
such a list.

According to relle we need to ask permission to add it to the codex. 
Last time I checked anybody could edit the codex w/o having to "ask 
permission" isn't that the point of a wiki?? but whatever.

Not being party to the discussion, I can only speculate, but:
Coming fresh out of the Codex Cleanup Week, the docs team may be
justifiably protective of the Codex, and wish to keep clutter to a
minimum, while they chase down any and all loose ends.

Ryan,

Codex needs contributions from people like you.  Don't let the policy
discourage participation.

Create a new page and contribute a great article!

It really is that simple.

Wikis allow other people to adjust your definition as well. I think all 
of Relle's points are valid, I wouldn't want to create/maintain an 
"a-list" of IRC people any more than I would for anything else. It's 
exclusionary, elitist, emotional, and I think it will cause more trouble 
than it's worth. If people on IRC are looking for more recognition may 
we could do something different, like have a poll on the most helpful 
IRC users and then send them a WP t-shirt or some sort of prize.

True, but wikis include a public revision history, and the bots
generally don't.

I can agree with this.

I don't think it's so much a matter of individuals wanting recognition
(at least not for themselves), as it is providing some sense of veracity
for people who come looking for help.  With 100+ nicks in the channel,
how can a new user know that they're dealing with someone who is
legitimately able to help them?

Obviously one answer is "_Do_ they help you when you ask?"
I've seen very little (none, actually) malicious activity toward new
users looking for help.  But new users won't have this perspective, and
may be justifiably trepidatious about following someone's advice without
any indication that the helper is on the up-and-up.

I've often poo-pooed the "# of posts" stats used on other forums to
denote the number of posts individual posters have made; but that might
be one way to help the new forum users know who's "legit", or at least
"been around long enough to be reasonably legit".  Or maybe after X
posts to the forums you get a different title, as is common on many forums.

Or maybe the forum mods just watch who consistently offers good advice,
and manually flag these users in some way that is visibly obvious to
forum users.

The "Install WordPress for A Friend" project that's been discussed (and on
the IRC Meetup discussion list again this week) is another list of qualified
people.

Why not let a person be nominated to the IRC list or the "Install WordPress
for A Friend" list.
Rule 1.  You can't put yourself on the list.
Rule 2.  You (the nominated person) keeps their information current.
Rule 3.   You also have to have a Codex User page to get on the list.

Can't be anymore of a nightmare than the multitude of Plugin and Theme
references now in Codex.

Let's brag about our high-qualified people!!

Nobody is looking for a t-shirt or a free prize Matt. We all support OSS 
in the same you do, by volunteering our own time and sometimes even 
money. We just wanted to be able to make it visible to new users in 
#wordpress who is very knowledgeable of wordpress and would be able to 
help them out.

I liked Michael H's suggestion in the next email. Maybe we can give 
voice status to users but base it on the criteria he suggested. Voted 
in, can't vote for yourself, continue to be an active participant, have 
a user page at the wiki. Most of the wordpress guru's (so to speak) 
already meet that criteria. How about a way to nominate people.

Message-ID: <42C15196.20202@cameraontheroad.com>

Codex Cleanup Week June 18-26 - Final Report

Arbitrary New Articles (brand new, not revised and fixed): 21
Arbitrary Tasks Completed (new tasks, not ongoing efforts): 18

* Changes to the Codex: Since Wednesday, June 15, several days before 
the start of the cleanup week, people were already starting to pitch 
in.  While exact numbers are hard to estimate without access to site 
statistics, it looks like about 3000 changes have been made to the Codex 
since then. More changes and release of documents are continuing as the 
Cleanup team continues their cleaning.

* While 21 people "officially" signed up, many more signed up for 
specific tasks and made offers of help via the IRC Chat #wordpress-docs.

* We put together a 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Cleanup/User_Statistics chart to track 
how many people worked on the Codex and what their contributions were 
during the 9 day event.

* The Task list has been cleaned up to only show the lists of items 
awaiting activity and sign up at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks.  The accomplished tasks have 
been moved to the discussion page: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex_talk:Tasks.

*The list of new articles submitted to Codex are as follows:
** http://codex.wordpress.org/Accessibility
** http://codex.wordpress.org/Add Link SubPanel
** http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding Asides
** http://codex.wordpress.org/Alphabetizing Posts

** http://codex.wordpress.org/Using Gravatars
** http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress Cookies

Categorizing the Codex:  While everyone on the Cleanup team has worked 
hard on this, special recognition needs to be given to the "categorizing 
team" who categorized EVERY one of the more than 400 articles on the 
Codex. The categories are coordinated with the main table of contents 
and listed at the bottom of every page. This will help increase the 
connection between related documents and improve user friendliness in 
the Codex. It is a huge, boring task and kudos to them for plowing 
through it all.

=======================
Summary

As it stands now, the Codex Cleanup Week has been a resounding success. 
Many goals set for this project have been accomplished:

* Increased awareness of the WordPress Codex as a resource
* Improvement of the reputation of the WordPress Codex as a valued resource
* Increased connection between the Forum and the Codex
* Increased volunteer activity on the Codex.
* Increased documentation
* Improved checking and verification of documents from a "team" and not 
an individual resulting in documents released faster and better quality 
assurance
* Improved communication
* Development of a task list for directing volunteer efforts
* The number of articles requiring copyright or expansion has been 
minimized. While some remain, they are the newest articles and/or are 
awaiting review and verification by experts.

Message-ID: <42C1A9D9.8000905@cameraontheroad.com>

A volunteer started an article on rewrites, based upon personal 
experience, and realized later that he had absolutely inadequate skills 
to complete such a document. He's asked us to clean it up and expand it, 
saying that there is no more he can do.  Working with him, we've 
completely rewritten the article, but both of us have gone as far as we can.

Would someone(s) familiar with migration and rewrites and redirects 
please help us to expand and finish the article so it may be moved out 
into the rest of the documentation. This is not an article about the 
entire process of rewrites, but a guide to help users make the 
transition and point them towards more documentation.

Doubtless you've all seen it by now (if not: http://wordpress.org/ 
development/2005/06/wordpress-1513/ ).

First off, UPGRADE.  Now, before you do anything else at all (well, I  
suppose you could backup first).

Secondly, could someone take a look at http://codex.wordpress.org/ 
Upgrading ?  I think it could use some work (I know - complaining  
without helping...).  A lot of it is 1.2.x specific.  Many users  
won't even have been around in the wp-layout.css days.

It seems to me the article can be made better by making it about  
upgrading from 1.5.x to 1.5.1.3.  The 1.2.x to 1.5.1.3 upgrade stuff  
is best handled separately (since it's more involved: introduction of  
themes).  This is done in http://codex.wordpress.org/ 
Upgrade_1.2_to_1.5 and is prominently linked from the main upgrade page.

Message-ID: <42C2EDEA.5090802@cameraontheroad.com>

After reviewing a bunch of things regarding the Codex over the Cleanup 
and the past couple of weeks, we've put together a list of things to do 
and issues we need to prepare for and answer on a new page we are 
calling the State of Codex: http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:State_of_Codex

This is similar to the Task List used during the cleanup, but it's 
purpose is to deal with administrative issues with the Codex in an open 
way, inviting all of the documentation team to give their opinion and 
add to the list.  The Codex has grown from a replacement wiki to a 
powerful resource fo WordPress and a strong backup of support resources 
for the Forum.

Please review the items on this list and you may make your comments on 
the page or in the Discussion page or in this mailing list.  We need 
your input and help to keep us all on the right track. Thanks.

Lorelle
