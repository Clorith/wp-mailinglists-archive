Subject: [wp-docs] Codex Source Links Broken due to /src/
Message-ID: <CAPdLKqduS5hhL0A8be7WcsONmgE191e1sSbzdrpWW5qy_koLHg@mail.gmail.com>

With the recent change to the directory structure of core.trac, I've run
across some function reference source links broken in the Codex.

For example: wp_nav_menu()<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu>

Current source link:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.7/wp-includes/nav-menu-template.php#L0

Correct source link:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.7*/src*
/wp-includes/nav-menu-template.php#L0

I assume someone much smarter than I am could write a script to bulk-update
the function reference source links to reflect the directory-structure
change?

No need. It was using a wiki include with some transclusion code, so I added in src. Should be good to go for every link that used that.

In WP terms, I fixed the shortcode.

Don't you think it might be better, if possible, to just have these redirected? We can't update links from the outside like that.

-J.D.

P.S. - I think this list is officially retired now, it may be better to post this somewhere else instead.

We're not dead yet! I'm getting better.

The external links we could make a meta-trac ticket for, since that 
would require some nginx magic, which I can't do via the wiki. Wiki is 
fixed.
