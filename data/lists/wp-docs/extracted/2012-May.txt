Subject: [wp-docs] dedicated Codex search function
Message-ID: <CAH+NfoA_O=ht9r3A-rk-36KRuZxX8dK26KsgEZ-Zg=Ns3RZWuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

The existing search functionality on wordpress.org has been bugging me, and
apparently other people as well, for quite a while, and I would like to
work on helping to fix that - especially in helping to provide a specific
Codex search functionality.

MediaWiki already has a decent search ability, which redirects to the found
page if an exact match for the search term is found in a page title.
Exposing this functionality would be an improvement over the current
situation: eg. compare the results of "
http://codex.wordpress.org/?search=posts" vs "
http://wordpress.org/search/posts". In my opinion, just offering a "Codex
search" box which used the MediaWiki search results, rather than the Google
results that appear now, would be helpful for most users trying to navigate
the Codex.

The situation gets trickier, however, with the entries which are prefixed
with Function_Reference/, Class_Reference/, etc. Look at the search results
found, for example, for "http://codex.wordpress.org/?search=wp_remote_post".
Not so pretty... And its kind of hard to programmatically determine, for
example whether a search term should be prefixed with "Function Reference",
"Function API", or whatever else.

Overall, this means that the Codex is not as useful to developers as it
could be. When I'm working, for example, I depend on DuckDuckGo's bang
syntax search often to quickly look up manual pages for functions, and the
experience looking up WordPress functions is definitely subpar as compared
to other environments. When I'm searching for PHP functions, like "!php
array_merge", the experience is a quick zero-click lookup. It would be nice
to have that same experience in the WP Codex, like if searching "!wp
register_post_type" would bring me directly to the relevant Codex page.

What is the solution to this? Does it make more sense to create redirect
pages for every function name indexed in the codex, ie creating a page
called "register_post_type" with the content "#REDIRECT
[[Function_Reference/register_
post_type]]", or is there an extension that will make searching more
user-friendly?

I'd like to work on this, but I'm not sure what discussions and decisions
have already happened. Can someone point me to a helpful way to contribute?

Thanks in advance,

This would be so awesome. Our MediaWiki is integrated into the entire site,
and at one time we had search options set that when you are in the Codex
you only search the Codex and when you are out of the Codex, your search
covers everything. The attempt has been made to open the search to
everything, and it is a mess with Google. A perfect search result would be
one that divided up the resulting content into Codex, Forum, etc. giving
more choice control to the user.

That's the goal, but is it possible between the WordPress and MediaWiki
interfaces? It sounds like you think it is.

The Docs team only has so much control over these things, so hopefully
someone with the ability to engage at the higher authority level on this
will jump in. You got my support. This has been a thorn for a long time.
Thanks for being willing to take it on.

Lorelle

Yes, I do think that on a limited scale, a search box that only searched
the Codex should be very doable and would be helpful to most people.


Speaking for myself, I use a browser search bar that posts to
codex.wordpress.org/?search=, and the results I get are very helpful to me.
Being able to type in something like "Settings API" and get to the Codex
page with no clicks saves me tons of time when I'm trying to look something
up quickly. Definitely better than using the slow Ajax Google search when I
know I just want to find the Codex article.

The biggest problem there is setting up redirects from all the possible
search terms to the proper Codex article; there would need to be a whole
lot of redirect pages set up.


The simplest ones (looks like there are 500-1000 of these) are the function
names and so on:

     {function name} to {prefix ie Function_Reference, Template_Tags,
etc.}/{function name}

Creating these could be easily automated, and I can volunteer to do it, if
the docs team approves.


Then there is a more editorial process of creating redirects from common
search terms to the most appropriate page, ie. "Spam" to "Combating Comment
Spam". This requires more knowledge about which articles are good and
regularly updated, and probably some metrics of the most commonly searched
terms. Some of this could be automated or taken on by someone like me, but
some might need more of a committee to make decisions.


I guess my question is: does anyone see objections as to why these redirect
stubs shouldn't be created? I don't personally see any issues with it, but
I haven't been working on the Codex very much yet, and I don't want to add
things to it that someone with a broader vision of the project thinks is a
bad idea.

Thanks,
Than

Hi,

It is possible to limit searches on Google using "site:" to just the
codex:

For example, this search:

   site:codex.wordpress.org bugs

... will find everything indexed on Codex with the words "bugs" in it.

   About 373 results (0.21 seconds)



You can also search the Function Reference only:

site:codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference wp_list_categories

Or both the Function Reference and the Template Tags reference:

site:codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference OR 
site:codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags wp_list_categories

Those urls could easily created with PHP or JavaScript.



The first item of this search is usually the Function Reference
and / or Template Tags Reference item:

wordpress wp_list_categories



The now defunct site: http://wplookup.com/ used to produce function
and template reference links to function name input. I believe Yoast
may have the code. I sorely miss it.

To search the inline docs for a function I often search the code
using this string:

"function function_name"

The inline docs often match the online docs, except for examples
and notes.



HTH,
Charles

It isn't up to us and the docs team to like or dislike. We can support,
cheer on, and dream, but the action on such a task needs to come from the
site development team. Search is fairly locked down. Not sure who is
involved in that now. Jane or Ozh should know. Hopefully they will chime in
on this.

At some point, I will fix this. However, right now, there's nothing
that can be done about it. It's not a priority and screwing with the
codex is a PITA that requires assistance from the systems guys.
There's caching involved and loads of other annoyances.

If you want to search only the codex, use this page to do it:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Search

Thanks for the input, Otto. I don't expect anything on the wp.org site to
change overnight... its working well enough for the thousands of people who
use it, don't mess with it on a whim.

The part of my idea that I thought could be acted on immediately, though,
is creating redirect pages [1] on the Codex wiki to make Codex search more
useful.

(To test the concept, I created a redirect from "register post type" to
"Function_Reference/register_post_type": now searching for
"register_post_type" on the Codex, ie
http://codex.wordpress.org/?search=register_post_type, now brings you
directly to the relevant function reference page.)

My question, not so much for the site admins as for other people on this
list, is: is this something I can/should take on? From a quick browsing of
the Special:AllPages codex entry, it looks like there are somewhere around
a thousand pages in English with prefixes that would need to have redirect
pages set up. Like I said, I don't see any possible downside, but if anyone
has any reason for me not to do this, please let me know.


Thanks,
Than

I think that's a good idea. It's what MediaWiki does on most of their sites :) I do it all the time.

Go to codex.wordpress.org/Multisite for example.

Message-ID: <3171B24A-D291-4DE9-976D-276AA9FC5F58@wordmonkey.me>

Hi all,

I've started working on some improvements to the WordPress FAQs. I started out with the FAQ About WordPress. I've removed some defunct questions and added some that I thought were relevant. http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_About_WordPress

Does anyone have any questions they think should be added to/removed from that page? 

I'm going to be working on the FAQs over the next few months and have made a google spreadsheet to keep track of things. If anyone wants to help out let me know! :)

Hi everyone. The results of the recent surveys to identify active 
contributors and elect team reps made it pretty clear that the docs team 
is in a bit of a slump, organizationally speaking. Only 5 people from 
the wp-docs post responded, and of those, 2 were new or not yet 
contributing, and there was no consensus re reps among the remaining 3 
respondents. It got me thinking about how we organize contributors, what 
has worked well elsewhere in the WP ecosystem and in other free software 
projects, and leads me to this proposal: what if we combined forums and 
docs into one Support team?

Looking back at the Codex activity from the past six months or year, 
chunks of it have been tied to forum mods (like Ipstenu and Andrea_r), 
other contributor groups (like Chip on the Theme Review Team), and new 
releases. Not that how Automattic/WordPress.com organizes itself should 
decide anything, but their support team manages forums, email support, 
and docs, and it seems to work pretty well. They have a schedule for 
reviewing existing documentation so it never gets too far out of date, 
and the people on the front lines with users in the forums and via email 
can see very clearly where they need to beef up documentation. I'm 
thinking this could work well for .org, too. Those who are strong 
writers and just want to contribute to documentation could still do so, 
but within a context of what our user support needs are at any given 
time based on the actual support requests.

What I'm envisioning is less siloing of contributor personnel, with one 
group blog at make.wordpress.org/support that uses tags like forums and 
codex to organize posts, and has pages to help orient new contributors 
and get them started. These mailing lists could fade away in favor of 
email subscriptions from the blog, which are more easily searchable and 
would be more visible to potential contributors. Within the uber-group, 
some people would naturally gravitate toward specific tasks while others 
would multi-task as they have been doing.

Over time we could expand the purview of the group to include things 
like moderating instructional videos and comments at wordpress.tv (and 
start embedding appropriate videos into codex), possibly helping to 
staff in-person help desks in local communities and/or at events like 
WordCamps and Meetups, etc. I think the prospects are pretty exciting, 
and I could see this becoming the biggest and most active of all the 
contributor groups, which would be awesome.

If there are any strong objections to this approach, please reply to 
this thread today so we can discuss. If not, and everyone is willing to 
give this a shot and all work together (at least as an experiment for, 
say, the next release cycle or two), I'll go ahead and set up the group 
blog tomorrow.

I can see the definite logic to this and I do like the idea of a Codex 
that is possibly more responsive to support (and, therefore, users') 
needs. My concern would be that, whilst there would more contributions 
and active editing, there might be less organisation. And a badly 
organised Codex is of no use to anyone.

I do think that documentation generally needs at least 1 (preferably 
more than 1) person who can step back and take the objective overview - 
free from any concerns about directly answering users' questions.

Does that make any sense?

tl;dr Great idea but I'd like to see someone (perhaps another sub-rep?) 
take on the role of Codex organisation, looking after review schedules etc.

Personally, I love the idea. Speaking as a contributor group member who
tries to keep in the loop regarding support and/or Codex issues that impact
our group (or issues where our contributor group can be helpful), such
consolidation is welcome.

It makes totally sense, because Support & Docs are two sides of the same
coin. :) If users can't understanding docs or can't find them, they post in
the forums. ;P

Better docs mean less support issues, because people don't scale. And the
people answering questions are the first ones who see the need for new
docs. Because they answer the same questions over and over (and over) again.

Getting people to read docs is a separate issue, but having support and
docs work hand in hand in tandem is a big first step.

I think half the people overlap anyway, yes?

a.

This is so exciting. The Docs team has been walking on egg shells for years
over the confusion of the WordPress Handbook, and I'm eager to see new
energy being sent in this direction.

The close ties between the Forum and Codex have been there since the
beginning. However, time and skills serving the Forum and the time and
skills serving documentation are distinctive, as several people mentioned.
I agree that there needs to be one or two people overseeing the
organizational structure, management, and maintenance of the Codex.

Having a site of our own has been essential and lacking, which is why we
created the unofficial docs task list not long ago. It was critical that we
find a better way of communicating and keeping our community connected than
the mailing list. As it was "unofficial," we haven't done much to promote
it or work with it, but it was a start. We need to have a place to support
and educate each other on how to write for the Codex and offer task lists
beyond those we've had in the past on the Codex, so I'm excited about
having our own space or making the current blog on WordPress.com official.

The mailing list has not been the sole line of communication either. As
many do, I work with many people one on one to help them write and edit for
the Codex and assign tasks, communicating with the mailing list when
necessary for edits and such.

As we struggled to understand the role the WordPress Handbook and WordPress
Lessons played in the role of documentation in the WordPress Community,
we've come to realize the Codex best serves the WordPress Community by
providing support for issues found within the Forums, expanding upon Learn
WordPress instructions for the WordPress Lessons section, and developing
more extensive documentation and guides beyond the basics found within the
help files, especially servicing developers and programmers.

While melding together Forum and Codex sounds great on the surface, I agree
with Andrea and others that we need to have one or more people focused on
the bigger picture overseeing the Codex, thus supporting the overall
WordPress Community better.

Thanks for the survey, Jane, and for helping with all of this.

Ideally a team of three. One is too few (what if they get busy? then it
stalls), and two can disagree (another stall) while a third can be a
tiebreaker if needed. Or a sane person, depending. :P

I'm just tossing out ideas here.

I've worked with some three person teams on many projects and love it for
that reason, Andrea. There are a LOT of plates to spin when it comes to the
Codex. We've never been able to get someone to coordinate the international
versions and I fear for what are on those pages, for example.

The WordPress Meetup group here in Portland has asked me to do a WordPress
Codex evening followed by a Codex Day. I'll be posting about that in a bit,
and I'd love to see more such projects from WordCamps and WordPress
Meetups, too, and that takes some team coordination as well.

Hi all,


I've started working on some improvements to the WordPress FAQs. I started out with the FAQ About WordPress. I've removed some defunct questions and added some that I thought were relevant. http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_About_WordPress


Does anyone have any questions they think should be added to/removed from that page? 


I'm going to be working on the FAQs over the next few months and have made a google spreadsheet to keep track of things. If anyone wants to help out let me know! :)

to the main Codex?

Reasoning: a lot of users still get confused about how the gallery (and 
especially the creation of the image attachments) works.

Great start Esmi! I've made some edits and additions, particularly a more
detailed discussion of how you exclude images from a gallery.

There's probably more that can be said about the gallery, based on how many
user questions there are about this feature.

Can we add:

<http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Esmi/The_WordPress_Gallery>

to the main Codex?

Reasoning: a lot of users still get confused about how the gallery (and 
especially the creation of the image attachments) works.

I'd be happy to collaborate on this, I've written this guide.

which has some screenshots which may be useful.

Almost lost your reply. We tend to reply at the TOP of the notes rather
than the bottom. :D

Check out http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com for a to do list and information
with links to Codex Guidelines, styles, and how to contribute. We need
people to just click the Random Page button to check links and grammar and
details, and people to fix articles that need updating and fixing, and
people to contribute new articles. All the information is at that site.

Begin by logging in through the WordPress Support Forum, then logging in
again through the Docs link at
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin Edit the page
and write a little about yourself so we know who you are and your skill
set, and use that page to practice writing in Mediawiki code. At the bottom
of the Edit preview is a link to Editing Help with all the examples of how
to write in Mediawiki.
