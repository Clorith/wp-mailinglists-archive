Subject: [wp-docs] Page Templates article
Message-ID: <AD690CAA-1823-4064-A890-1D03CC9E1498@hearingvoices.com>

This is a proposed new Codex article, splitting off Page Templates from the Pages article:http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Page_Templates

As discussed on:
http://make.wordpress.org/docs/2013/04/09/adopt-a-codex-page/#comment-21173

Most of the Pages#Page_Templates info is included here, but re-written somewhat. All the Examples are preserved, but given consistent formatting (eg, indents), and updated from Twenty Eleven theme structure to Twenty Thirteen.

Also added some examples of my own, which are more for dev purposes, but may be helpful:http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Hearvox/Custom_Page_Templates#Page_Template_Functions

article ready for everyone's edits/comments,

I'm revising some Page Template stuff over at Codex,
and came upon something i need y'all's consult on:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_page_templates

seems like calling just: get_page_templates();

gets you a fatal Undeclared Function error. what's works is:
wp_get_theme()->get_page_templates()

if so, i should correct the above url.
but wanted to check w/ you Core Kids first.
