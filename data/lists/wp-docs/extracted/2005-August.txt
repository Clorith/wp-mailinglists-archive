Can we have a FAQ for people sending legal notices to WordPress asking 
us to take down a blog? I get one or two of these a week. People don't 
understand that just because it says "powered by WP" we don't actually 
run it.

I'll just toss out a few ideas

-The WordPress developers have no control over and cannot take
responsibility for content published to any blog powered by WordPress
-The WordPress developers cannot disable WordPress powered websites at any time
-etc.

Some keywords have been added to the Theme list so that might also be a 
good set of keywords to follow.  Anyone else with some ideas for 
keywords for Themes for a check off list?

Okay, you have a new page: http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies

It needs filling and it needs review and writing up by an attorney. I 
know it ain't nice, but it has to happen. There are other issues beyond 
just a line that says "hey, we no responsible for idiots who use our 
software". We got to say "hey, we totally no responsible for all the 
idiots who use our software, forums, etc."

Ah, the fun of running a serious business begins. ;-)

I think you should have a landing page so that the 'powered by
wordpress' link goes to that instead of to the homepage and it can be
written for that audience.

you can use...

codex.wordpress.org/poweredby 

or some such link

-------

- Powered by Wordpress [Page Title]

Welcome! You may have arrived at this page because you followed a
'Powered by WordPress' link from another web site. 

-- What is WordPress?

WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform
with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability. What a
mouthful. WordPress is both free and priceless at the same time.

[Learn more] about using WordPress to publish on the web.

-- What does 'Powered by' mean? [anchor here for link to send out]

A link reading [Powered by WordPress] means that a site owner is
proudly announcing that WordPress is their publishing platform of
choice. 

If you need to contact the content creator or site owner, or host, 
contacting the people behind WordPress would be a mistake. Why?
WordPress is the publishing software program used by the publisher,
not the publisher. 

[Learn more] about why WordPress is not responsible for the content of
other websites. 





Then we can welcome them properly, sort and send them on their way
according to their interest.

This is a little formal, I'm more interested in something that says in 
layman's terms that WordPress.org doesn't host or run every random 
WordPress blog you come across. It needs to break it down in technical 
but simple terms, because people just DO NOT get it.

With all due respect, if you know what you want, why are you looking to 
others to write it?

The information on the page may seem formal, but it is the language that 
speaks volumes.  And a three sentence policy regarding "WordPress not 
responsible" isn't enough.

If anyone comes to you whining about anything associated with the 
policies of WordPress, you now have a multipurpose document that can 
answer all such questions. 

I think that policies in place that protect WordPress, WordPress 
volunteers, members, users, developers, etc., is a GOOD policy and long 
overdue.

And just to remind everyone that WordPress is no longer a little home 
business, here are some more FAQ/Facts:

v1.5 Downloads: 450,525
Participants on WordPress Forum - More than 25,000
Post Totals on WordPress Forum - 206,637
Registered users on WordPress Codex - 2471
Number of Languages Supported - 35
WordPress official hosts: 5
WP-hackers Mailing List: 436
Codex Volunteers Mailing List: 165
WP-Testers Mailing List: 451
Polygots (languages) Mailing List: 145
Forum Volunteers on Mailing List: 18 (new)

We're still collecting stats, but grouped together, it's an amazing 
thing to see. Be proud of those numbers. Add to that the number of 
emails Matt gets every day about WordPress (~1000 ;-)  ), very 
impressive numbers and a lot to manage. Luckily, WordPress attracted a 
lot of strong volunteers to help spread the management efforts around.

We hardly need many paragraphs with lots of "wherefore" "herewith" 
"thereof" and "indemnity" there though do we ?
It's software - and we need no EULA.

Don't recall such a thing ever happening.

'Protect' ? Legal bills met ? Insurance ?
A sense of perspective is needed here ....

I never thought it was.

Ahh, the things people do and their ramifications...so this speaks a  
little to http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies article  
that's in progress.

I noted last night an article at http://news.com.com/ 
2061-11199_3-5815902.html entitled, "Soldier's blog closed as debate  
rages." Interest was piqued so I poked around until I found "leonard  
clark, national guardsman" at http://leonardclark.com/blog/ -- it was  
run using WordPress 1.5. Nice indirect marketing. Anyway, this sort  
thing seems to speak to the idea of WordPress insulating itself with  
the "hold harmless" language found in the WordPress Policies document.



Another blogger that got canned.

Wouldn't something similar to what a "news" organization offers up prior to 
an "editorial" also suffice as to the issue. Something to the effect of "the 
views of the blog published under the "powered by WordPress" is soley 
theirs, and is not neccessarily the views or opinions of the..". Obviously 
I'm not a legalese speaker, but the language is very common for such 
commentaries.

Subject: [wp-docs] August Update on Codex
Message-ID: <42F36AEA.50708@cameraontheroad.com>

With so much going on lately, and a lot happening in the meetup and via 
the IRC chats on documentation, we've decided to release a monthly 
"update" on what is going on with the Codex and to point out specific 
tasks and issues that need to be known and discussed.

About 136 new articles have been added since June 4 and more are on the 
way. A lot of work has gone into expanding the Codex by many volunteers 
and new volunteers are coming in all the time. Volunteers are watching 
the Recent Changes pages 24 hours a day, monitoring the Codex for spam 
and link vandals, usually catching the vandals within minutes of the 
attack. Thanks to all!

The connection between the Forum and the Codex is now very strong, 
creating a solid base of information and resources. With the release of 
the Jalenack's plugin (with great help from Ringmaster)  
http://blog.jalenack.com/archives/codex-search-plugin/ which allows the 
addition of a search bar to the WordPress admin panels for searching the 
Codex and Forum while using WordPress, users can get access to the 
information they need to solve their problems and help them build and 
maintain their WordPress site easier. We need to promote the plugin to 
help users "Search First". If you have been monitoring the Forum, you 
may have noticed that the redundant simple questions are declining and 
the more intermediate and advanced questions are rising. So they are 
searching first, which is great.

With the development of the Support Forum volunteer mailing list 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Support_Forum_Volunteers, volunteers will be 
able to work together and learn from each other about how to better 
provide ongoing support. Many of us also help on the forum, so we can 
help volunteers learn more about the documentation available and learn 
from them about what documentation is needed.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference is slowly being expanded 
and worked on to include all the functions in the core programming, 
similar to Template Tags. Help is needed to add more subpages, 
identifying functions and their features.

Keywords are slowly being added to the 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes/Theme_List so if you are a theme 
author or you would like to volunteer to add keywords to various themes, 
please pitch in.  A lot of theme authors list their themes and then 
don't return for months, if ever, so all help is appreciated to get 
keyword descriptions on these themes.

We are still having problems with new images displaying right on the 
Codex, so hopefully that will be fixed soon, now that the database has 
been moved to the new server.

There are many tasks on the task list that need doing, so please check 
to see if there is something you can do. 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks If you signed up for a task and 
are now unable to follow through on it, please remove your name so 
someone else can take it on. If you see holes in the documentation that 
are not listed on the Task List, please add them in their appropriate 
category so we can encourage "filling of holes".

If you have an article on your user page, you will be contacted in the 
next few weeks with a request to ready the article for moving out into 
the main documentation. If you are unable to complete the article, 
please let us know so we can have others pitch in to finish it.

The http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:State_of_Codex lists administrative 
issues and tasks that need to be discussed and dealt with.  Some of 
these have been waiting for a decision or action. While no decision has 
been officially made, it appears that the issue of dealing with version 
1.5 and 1.6 will include the use of the version in the title and the use 
of a template banner that states this applies to which version where 
necessary. Other than user levels and administration panels, and updates 
and inclusion of new template tags and functions, very little change to 
the "how to" documentation is expected to occur.

Work is underway to "combine" the Codex and WordPress site so that when 
a user clicks on "DOCS" they will be taken to the Codex. 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:RobLa/AuthPress_for_MediaWiki is part of 
the process.  Basically, bbpress and mediawiki will be "intercombined". 
User registration information will be shared between the two so your 
user name and password will work on both systems. There are some bugs 
and details that still need to be worked out. The "look" of the Codex 
will take on the look of the Forum, with modifications on both ends. In 
general, the merger and changes will "spruce the place up".

Thanks to everyone for all your hard work!

The difference, though, is that in newspapers, the author's comments are 
actually printed in the publisher's publication. He thus has some kind of 
responsibility. We do only supply the software. Kind of the printer 
supplying the paper. We don't have to talk to them about opinions. Just tell 
people we're only doing software, nothing else. If they want to approach the 
author of any blog, this is the wrong place.*

Anyway: There's a very easy way to check whether something is written 
clearly enough: Translate it into another European language using Babelfish 
or therelike and then back into English. If it's still easy to understand 
and well formulated (with one or two glitches) your job is done. If not, try 
again... ;o)

*) We might use something along the lines "Please understand that we at 
WordPress.org have no influence on any of the WordPress' powered blogs. We 
only deliver the software. Everything else on other people's blogs is beyond 
our influence."

What is the status of answers and code that has been posted to the
forums ? I'm seeing such code/answers appearing in Codex.

Ryan was not sure back here:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-June/000624.html

If we are trawling the forums to scrape for codex information then I
think we need to be very open about this.

This isn't ideal, but this is how I understand it's currently working. 
In absence of a policy that says otherwise, posts submitted to the 
forums become like "property" of wordpress.org, so using them on the 
codex shouldn't be an issue.

This seems like a situation that should be clarified. How about a
notice on the forums, perhaps when posting, that users asre agreeing
that "all information submitted to the WordPress support forums may be
repurposed for use on the WordPress Codex" or something? It is a gray
area without a policy, which isn't in keeping with WPs generally

Do we have a Codex page discussing how to localize plugins?  I know we
have a lot of info for localizing WordPress itself, but I can't seem to
find a set of instructions for plugins.

If no such documentation exists, I'll commit to writing some today, as
time permits.  Seems silly for each plugin author to have to include
such instructions with each plugin.

That should read "how to use localization files for plugins".  I know we
have docs for plugin authors on how to make .pot files.

I want user docs for how to use .po files.  And I don't want to
re-invent the wheel if these docs already exist.

While the editing feature has been locked down during the ending process 
of the move to synch the Codex database, MOVING and UPLOADING are not 
locked down.  We've just been hit with some image vandals.

Just thought you all should know and help keep an eye on the Codex even 
if it appears to be inaccessible.  And maybe future maintenance efforts 
like this should include locking down those features as well.

Okay, here is an update on the Codex.  To sum it up, Matt says "It's broke."

Specifically, images were lost and now found. You might be able to edit, 
but don't because the odds are good that it will look like you can but 
you won't be able to, and the changes you make might not "keep". Same 
with moving files. You will have to sign in again and if you forgot your 
user name and password, the process of emailing it to you is also not 
working. 

The good news is that the Codex is readable and still viable as a 
resource. So hang in there and we'll be back to editing, uploading, and 
moving really soon. Thanks for your patience!!

Subject: [wp-docs] codex page titles
Message-ID: <122d4b4d05080918165bd0aed6@mail.gmail.com>

I'm just starting to get the hang of the spiffy new plugin for the 
forums-to-codex linking tool, and am curious how specific the page title 
needs to be, particularly, regarding capitalization. I've noticed some pages 
can be "template_hierarchy", where others can be "Designing_Headers". If the 
plugin is requires exact capitalization, perhaps a task for the codex to do 
list could be to standarize the page titles to all be the same. I may 
remember that the template hierachy page is "template_hierarchy", but I may 
not remember that it's not "designing_headers".
I would volunteer, but honestly my plate is getting full enough.

Titles in the Codex are very consistent in form, but in function they 
are more complicated.

According to the guidelines for the Codex, titles follow the rules of 
Title Case, so Template Hierarchy is that way, but The Loop in Action is 
The_Loop_in_Action. http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines more 
specifically: http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines#Titles. Now, 
some of the older documents from when the Codex was new should all have 
been changed to the proper title case, but some still get caught. If you 
find one, then please let the docs team know so we can fix it right away 
so all the titles are consistent.

Now, this is where it gets confusing.

If you are creating a link within the Codex to another page in the 
Codex, you must use the EXACT upper and lower case structure of the 
original file.  So [[the Loop in Action]] won't work.  Neither will 
[[the loop in action]]. It has to be [[The Loop in Action]], usually 
without the underlines though that will work, too, it's just ugly.  
We've made some redirects for things like The_Loop, the_loop, and 
The_loop to accommodate this.

 From outside of the Codex, any incoming link will work such as 
http://codex.wordpress.org/The_loop_in_Action.  Case doesn't matter, it 
will work.

Now, from the forum....we need to do some tests to see what works. If it 
only uses the Mediawiki constraints for links within the Codex to 
another Codex page, then we are stuck with the exact capitalization.  If 
it works as though it is an external link, then it doesn't matter.  So 
which is it?  Let's do some tests.

Miklb, do you want to do some tests on this? You can either test it in 
practice, or on the thread that announced the links to the Codex and say 
"this is a test of the links" and then post it so we can see the 
results.  When we have the results and the Codex is fixed and able to be 
edited (hopefully today or tomorrow), then we can write up a page that 
helps volunteers and others understand how this really should work.

Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

One problem with this - as far as I can see - is that Codex cannot get 
it's head around a 404.
If we have a page called "http://codex.wordpress.org/rabbits" and that 
is altered to "http://codex.wordpress.org/Rabbits" then we must have 
redirects put in else we'll have the chance that people will click a 
link into Codex and arrive to see

rabbits
(There is currently no text in this page)

Not saying it should not be done, just that we need to be careful with 
the redirecting.

If I know for a fact that all pages should be "Designing_Headers", then I 
will use that format. I can not find the page I followed to get to the 
template hierarchy page, that I originally referenced, but any I see today 
are all Template_Hierarchy. Go figure. The external linking is the odd case, 
for sure. And if I come across any links that look wrong, I will bring it to 
someone's attention. Thanks for clarifying things.

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex on PDF
Message-ID: <42FA7D5B.5080504@tamba2.org.uk>

I posted this to the forum earlier:
"There is now documentation you can download, read offline and print ! 
Over at http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/docs are listed over 240 
complete pages (a total of ~34meg of information) taken verbatim from 
Codex. You can download just those sections you need - and none that you 
do not.

Before you start downloading or commenting though, please take a moment 
to read the information I?ve put together here: 
http://www.tamba2.org.uk/T2/codex-and-pdf/
It should address what I think will be common questions.

WordPress code isn?t static, and neither will these docs be either. It?s 
one thing to get everything there now, it?s going to be another to keep 
this project uptodate. When Codex recovers from the move, a new page for 
this project will be created in my User space. Any and all issues about 
this can be discussed there and if you want to help that?s the place to be.

Feedback welcome. "

It's more to stop me having to answer the same questions a zillion times 
in the forums. Had Codex been working, there would have just been a 
single link to a page there.

'docs page' ? Which one ? I have no access to the docs page on wp.org, 
and the docs are linked from my guides.

I think he means link between the two pages on your site...

http://www.tamba2.org.uk/T2/codex-and-pdf/ should have a link to 
http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/docs/ or at least 
http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/

And then http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/docs/ should have a link 
back to http://www.tamba2.org.uk/T2/codex-and-pdf/

I looked for the links myself when browsing there last night.

Subject: [wp-docs] hyperlinking images to Codex
Message-ID: <42FBABDE.1030604@cameraontheroad.com>

I've deleted five images in the past two weeks as "inappropriate image 
for the Codex". I've recently found out that these images are being used 
as gravatars and signature links on chats all over the web. People post 
these images where they can, and the openness of wikis is a prime 
target, and then link from there to the chats where the image is viewed 
as part of their messages and signature. This "hotlinking" then uses our 
bandwidth and not theirs. The trend appears to be growing on the 
WordPress Codex.

Setting up an anti-hotlink feature in the Codex's .htaccess could help 
prevent this in the future, but until this is done, please keep an eye 
out for such "inappropriate images" and either delete them or let one of 
the admins know. In general, the images tend to not be "offensive", but 
we need to keep on top of such inappropriate use since editors and 
authors use the image galleries often to find images to add to their 
articles and why clutter things up with pictures of angels, flowers, and 
fairies dancing in the woods.

Thanks,

Lorelle

Suggestion - Create a small image something to the effect of

"This image illegally hotlinked"

and replace theirs with it, then leave it for a couple of days before 
deleting it.  Just keep a note of each time you replace the original 
image so you remember when to delete it later..

Hmm, that seems like too much manual labor and doesn't exactly extend 
the friendly image of WordPress.

The method I used for my own site is one I found on ALA:
http://www.alistapart.com/articles/hotlinking/

It would prevent people from embedding codex images as <img> tags in 
other sites, but wouldn't prevent them from linking to those images with 
an anchor <a> tag.  Direct incoming links to an image would be 
redirected automatically to a page that says, "This image is part of the 
WordPress Codex," rather than just showing the image itself.

And if we're really fancy, we can figure out which Codex page the image 
is already on, and provide links to those pages.  That would be sweet.

Well, using .htaccess files you could also redirect a linked image to 
another image, such as the one I mentioned.  On my own site I linked 
such to an image of a crop circle in a litter box...  =D  Maybe I should 
put that back into my site, now that I'm not linking to it anymore myself...

Right.  And I hoped to point out that it's probably not a good idea to 
have images that seem like they're coming from WordPress look like crop 
circles in litter boxes, or other strange "Don't do that" images.  It's 
also probably not worth the effort to track which images this technique 
had been applied to for later housekeeping.

Instead, simple blanket hotlinking denial should suffice, and incoming 
links to images will instead point to actual useful pages containing the 
images (along with WordPress copyright info) rather than simply showing 
only the image itself.

I'm not sure who's responsible for the theme viewer at 
themes.wordpress.net, but I thought I'd try here first.

Here you go:
http://asymptomatic.net/temp/wrc_tv_thumbs.zip

420x315 pngs of every theme on the site, ripe for the Presentation tab 
in WP1.6.

I can improve the aliasing, but it might also need sharpened.  Thoughts?

And who wants it when I'm done, anyway?

No, but I saw you committed screenshots for a few of the themes (the 
ones in /extend?), and I just compiled screenshots for every theme in 
the WRC theme viewer.  I thought to hand them over and let them be 
inserted as needed.

Only a handful of themes are in the repository right now. Would you be

If I had some themes to load in, sure.  Where do I get 'em?  There isn't 
a direct download link on themes.wordpress.net for any of the themes you 
can view.  Do I need to follow the links and root around for them?

Remember, running install.php or upgrade.php is NOT required for this 
upgrade. Just delete old files and upload new.

If upgrading from a version older than 1.5.1.3 (can we have verification 
here?), DO NOT do a partial upgrade but an all files upgrade.

This should not be in the Codex as it is not supported.

I'm not sure if anyone else is having troubles with the nifty Codex 
links but here is one that I found:

[[Site Architecture 1.5]] doesn't work. I think it's the period causing 
the problem. The full link is 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Site_Architecture_1.5

Anyone else having trouble with specifics? Please let us know so when 
the Codex is back and running, we can do a page on this in the Forum 
Volunteer's article.

Sorry about the information on the Foreign Language files in the Upgrade 
article on the Codex. The WordPress in Your Language series of three 
articles was just completely rewritten to make all kinds of installation 
and upgrading and support information better available and inclusion of 
that information was on my To Do List when the Codex went....down. 
Hopefully it will be up and running soon and we can clarify that 
information.

The entire Upgrade WordPress page in the Codex has been rewritten many 
times lately. We're trying to accommodate all the different 
installations and upgrades and make the document much more user 
friendly.  Stay tuned.

Hi folks,

I expect to have to spend a lot more time at school than before now,
and so will be off the scene for I don't know how long. I just wanted
to let everyone know, so please don't wait on me for anything. If
there is anything I can do to tie up loose ends, let me know, and I
will.

Good luck,

The only thing that comes to mind, is there was some discussion regarding 
printable docs, and we were told that was your project, and not to make any 
decisions until your return. Was there anything you had started, or an 
outline of a plan to put something together that would be beneficial to 
anyone who may want to work on such a project?

Michael,

Nothing was started. I had had a small discussion through email with
Lorelle, when we thought it would be cool to whip up a book
(downloadable document) for WordPress 1.6. The plan was for me to
co-ordinate efforts. Since I will be unavailable for most, I suppose
that plan will have to change. Since nothing was started upon, not
much needs to change.

Carthik.

As mentioned before, a "table of contents" was started (now two of 
them), and we found immediately that there were too many holes that 
needed to be filled. Thus the push for the Codex Cleanup and getting 
more involvement adding documentation.

They are:

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_Wanted
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Codex_Categories

There are still a lot of gaps, some easy, some complex, that need to be 
filled in. And there is a lot of work on structure and style of the 
book, such as "WordPress for Dummies" style, or more comprehensive.

Has anyone "read" the German book on WordPress? That might be helpful 
information.

As the Codex currently stands, a very, very, bare bones "WordPress for 
Dummies" must be culled, but there are some big holes even in that.

My effort was for nothing then.
Feedback from me was also not looked for.

And I very specifically asked about a book didn't I ?

This thread was started two days ago - is there a chance to get an

Hi All,

I came across this email in the countless emails I am trying to catch up with.

Podz - You are right about the need for us to take the initiative with
respect to getting the book out the door.

Lorelle, and others - I have no qualms about my work being used by
others. It is out there specifically for that purpose - to be used. I
am not protective about any of it either. If it needs to be chopped
up, well so be it, I say. If someone makes a profit out of my work, so
be it. If the person were a "good man", he/she'd ask me before doing
it, and definitely credit me ;)

I am sorry if my not reading and responding to this email earlier
caused any ulcers ;)

Carthik.

When the topic of the book came up, those links were also supplied and
the mention of holes in the documentation was also mentioned.

If a movement towards a book form of the Codex or something else
regarding WordPress is to begin, and Carthik will not be involved or
have limited involvement (now that we know that), then let's get on with
it. Since he talked about it and was excited and inferred he had plans,
then I wanted to make sure he was a part of it. He's an important part
of the Codex team and I didn't want him excluded. Only fair. Thanks to
everyone for waiting.

Again, there is little we can do on the Codex as long as it continues to
be locked down, but we can make plans and look at the holes in the
documentation that need to be filled. We can also talk about the form,
as mentioned, the book might take, be it Dummies, or more technical. And
if we are to use the whole Codex or write something similar but different?

There are a lot of questions and possibilities.

Lorelle

I just posted this to the forum:

"Clicking the link below will download into your machine a zip of the 
Open Office 2 files that I used to create the PDF's.

Note: Open Office 2 - it's in beta but only it can do embedded URL's in 
PDF's. I have no idea what other program will open them - but I do know 
that Notepad++ just see garbage characters.

Open Office beta:
http://download.openoffice.org/680/index.html
73 meg Windows file.

As Codex has been uneditable, it's all right up to date.

Maybe you can think of a way to better present them ?

All the files (4.38meg zip
http://www.zen77857.zen.co.uk/docs/ODTFiles.zip "

For various reasons, I would LOVE to see these files being used in 
different ways by different people and in a manner that is FREE.

This is not related to anything posted here or - strangely enough - in 
any other list. I have huge respect for everyone who has contributed to 
the docs be that in one crucial correction or in writing them or as 
Lorelle has done in encouraging, cajoling and nagging (only when needed 
!) to create an excellent resource. But a resource in one place is no 
good - it has to be spread out, it has to reach everyone.

PDFs are binary files anyway, right? So Notepad and other text editors
would see garbage regardless of whether they had embedded URLs or not.

As for which programs support them, I know KPDF does, and I'm pretty
sure Adobe Acrobat does.

Apologies for being unclear - the last link I posted was to the complete 
collection of .odt files - which are the product of Open Office.
Using those files it would be relatively easy to group them as you 
wished then do whatever you pleased. The PDF's can't easily be 
manipulated whereas this is the raw stuff.

10 good reasons for Codex being kerplunk!


10. Don't have to worry about spelling corrections.

9. Recent Changes addicts get their life back.

8. There's no controversy about who can create a new Codex page in the main
namespace.

7. Page view counts now just reflect visits by readers.

6. Backups of Codex don't need to be done daily.

I read the following as a tag line in another forum:

*I'm beginning to wonder if Sauron made a forum when he made that ring.
And it was administered by elves, the fairest of all races, the dwarves 
were moderators, and the rank of newbie was given to men who above all

Now more than 20 days and still off. The only information that was
available here came from Lorelle. At August 2nd she told that the Codex
editing was turned off due to a move, at August 9th a short explanation
followed ("Matt says: 'it's broke'") saying that the codex will "be ...
back very soon".

Well, I'm not directly involved (yet) in contributing to the Codex, but
nevertheless I think that's BAD. If at least there would be a reaction
to those of the regulars (such as Podz) who asked one week ago (!) about
what's going on here...

@Lorelle: don't get me wrong, this isn't against you. You've been the
one who gave away all information that you seem to have had in this
regard - thanks for the updates!

Bye, Mike

Thanks for the info. Where "very shortly" is quite stretchable. Well,

Good news, the Codex will be up tomorrow morning.

For docs team members http://wordpresscodex.com/Main_Page is the 
temporary URL and is unlocked. So edit away. Tomorrow morning it will be 
like on codex.wordpress.org again.

Don't link to wordpresscodex.com! It's just a temp domain.

Definitely not a pressing issue, but curious if the current look of the 
codex is here to stay. Reason asking, navigation is slightly different now 
with the new look, and as I had just gotten the old look down...anyway, just 
curious.

Okay it's been moved over to the subdomain as planned.

The plan is still to have it integrate with the rest of wordpress.org.

?

Looks the same here. Possible you got reset to a different skin.
If so, log in, go to your Preferences, and Choose the Codex or
Monobook listing under Skins (they are the same).

I drafted it.

I'll see if I can add something for what it would take to do
this in Word. I prefer OO for creating PDF, but much of what
I convert is complex tabled Word documents, and what a pain
those are to make pretty in OO.

During the migration in the past few days, Codex caught a little 
jaundice. It's back and looks and runs the same, though for me it 
actually works a little faster.

What Matt is saying is that eventually, the Codex will be blended in, as 
previously reported, to the wordpress.org site so when you click DOCS 
you will be taken to the Codex and the two sites will be "blended" in 
look and style.  The style of the whole thing will probably undergo 
changes, but we'll just have to wait and see, and be patient, with 
everyone else. I'm sure it will look great.

Would using OO be a feasible way of making a PDF in Linux?

On Mac OS X, there is a PDF option on every print dialog.

On 10.4, at least, you can go to File - Print, then select the "Save  
to PDF..." option from the PDF menu.

With GNU/Linux, you can print to a .ps (postscript) file, and then 
execute the ps2pdf command to convert the .ps into a .pdf

Message-ID: <430FEECF.1070009@cameraontheroad.com>

As of late Friday afternoon, it looks like Hurricane Katrina is heading 
my way. Oh, the fun is just too much fun. So we will be evacuating 
again. And just as the Codex is back up and running.

Matt and his Codex-behind-the-scenes-workers (applause!) still have to 
clean up Codex images and image views, and a  few other things that 
might need fixing. Be sure and let him know if you get any strange 
errors or bugs that need resolving, but so far, from the few minutes of 
pounding away at the Codex, it looks like it's back and pretty stable. 
Thanks!!!

I have left a HUGE list of things that have needed doing with Schulte 
and he may be asking you all for your help while we hit the road again 
running from natural disasters in the making. Be nice when he asks, if 
he asks, for your help and help him by asking what you can do to help 
share the load and get these little things done and cleaned up.

Also, if you have signed up for any task on the 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks List make sure you let him, 
MichaelH, or me know the status of your article(s) or post them in your 
user area so we can get these out and into the public eye. If you have 
an article in your user section that is ready to be released, edited or 
reviewed, please let us know so we can get to work on it.

Firas, Masquerade and others were working on a listing of all the 
functions in WordPress as well as all the hooks for Plugins. Please 
check with them if you would like to help on this project. It's very 
intensive and exciting, but it requires a lot of labor, too.

There are still folks hanging out in #wordpress-docs IRC channel who are 
there to help you if you need advice or information on helping the 
Codex, so please, take advantage of them - they are waiting for you. 
It's been rather dull lately, and we need to shake the dust off.

Thank you to everyone for being so patient and hanging in during this 
big move. There are more changes in store, I'm sure, so I think it's a 
good idea to get as much work done as possible so when the big move to 
merge the forum and Codex together, we're ready for it.

I'll let you all know when we head out and when we're back. And if you 
are in the path along with the millions of others, take cover and be safe.

Subject: [wp-docs] Themes vs Templates
Message-ID: <3cf08c810508270832504a0ad5@mail.gmail.com>

I am doing some editing and have run into some confusion. Themes and
templates seem to be discussed as if they are the same thing. To me,
they are not. When selecting a layout in Presentation, are we
selecting a template or a theme? To me, a theme is a stylesheet
applied to a template, and we should be using the term template most
of the time rather than theme. What is the official position on these
terms?

Bear with me if this is answered somewhere, I am finally getting my
feet wet with working on the codex.

Virgil,

You are selecting a Theme when choosing a layout. A theme is a  
collection of template files. Check out http://codex.wordpress.org/ 
Using_Themes#What_is_a_Theme.3F

Never in the Codex or on this list. Sometimes in the forum by
newbies...

Please, also bear in mind this is _not_ a support list! So, if you
have questions that have to be clarified, you should post them to the
forum.

However, if you can point us to a page where the Documentation Team
screwed it up and they were using themes and templates as
interchangeable terms... you are welcome to help us to correct that
mistake.

thanks,

moshu

As Schulte explained, templates and the style sheet are parts of a 
Theme.  Here are some helpful articles to familiarize yourself with 
WordPress structure.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Site_Architecture_1.5
http://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Templates
http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes
http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development

And a lot of help is needed on the Codex that will help you get started 
without starting by writing an article and such. Check out the many 
things to do on the Task List: http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks at 
the top of the list for a lot of simple and easy to do things.

By the way, did you have some specific ideas and tasks you are 
especially interested in for helping on the Codex? Then we can give you 
more direction.

Thanks for helping!

to Moshu: My question was directly related to the codex docs. I was
editing a paragraph and the distinction between themes and templates
wasn't clear. Part of my confusion stems, I think, from my first
experiences with WP when I found a page (I think on the codex, but not
sure) with a long list of links to templates. These templates are what
you and others are calling themes, yet are called templates in some
places. I just was trying to avoid making an error. I have no problem
using the term theme.

to Lorelle: I think for now I want to do some editing to get my feet
wet. I am an instructional designer, so maybe can do some tutorials. I
am not an expert in WP, so need fairly simple tasks at this point.

Thanks,
Virgil

We look forward to your help, and anything that can be done to help 
clarify the documentation is always welcome. And as mentioned, a lot of 
basic stuff needs to be done that is listed on the Codex:Tasks list - so 
do what you can, and you can find help online at the IRC docs channel on 
FreeNode at #wordpress-docs and/or in #wordpress if you have questions 
about what you are editing and doing.

And be sure and go through the Guidelines and Codex Styles pages to see 
how we do things around here. The Codex isn't your normal wiki. ;-)

Thanks for your help!

Thanks, Virgil. We'll have the group who worked on totally redoing the 
FAQs recently go over it. I believe there may be still some information 
to add to some of the FAQ pages. The conversion from the old pages to 
the new took a lot of work and they did a fabulous job. A lot of the 
code within those pages need reviewing, too, so if anyone is up to 
dusting off their coder hats - please take a good look through all of 
the new FAQ pages and clearly identify which issues pertain to v1.2, 
1.5, and subsequent versions.

We will be having some templates to help identify which section pertains 
to which in the next week or two. I'm working on them but they will have 
to wait until I get back "home" from being a hurricane refugee. Weee. 
There isn't electricity back there, yet, and it may be a few days or a 
week, so we're not in a big hurry. If I get longer Internet access time, 
I'll finish those up later this week. The templates are mostly designed 
to accomodate whole sections and the FAQs can just have a note in bold 
identifying which version the FAQ belongs to, if it does belong to a 
specific version.

Thanks!

Lorelle

add WordPress Lessons to the main page. Could we add a link to 
[[WordPress Lessons]] on the menu to help people get to the tutorials?

I just noticed that MacManx has added a disclaimer to his user page

there something that happened or is this just a good idea? Should others 
think about such things? Yikes.

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies was started and it should 
contain a similar disclaimer to protect members and volunteers, so it 
might be time to look at this again and make sure that everyone and 
everything is protected by whatever protection is possible for whatever 
reason.

Personally, this stuff makes me crazy but this is how the world works 
when we are living in the "Age of Litigation". Let's COA. ;-)

I've seen that, and I can see why MacManx might have done that.
I won't. Until I am a fully paid employee of WordPress*, then people had 
better make their own distinctions and make them correct. I already 
censor myself on my blog when I want to post what I really think, so 
I'll be damned if I'm going to start sticking disclaimers or whatever 
elsewhere :)

*Not that I anticipate this at all, I'm just giving an example.

Michael,

I could be wrong, but I'm guessing it's gone now that the search is  
integrated with the Support Forum.

I have just done several searches for Codex links within the new search 
on the Codex. Two of the searches forced me to click through 3 pages of 
results before I encountered my first Codex article result. One of those 
I had to go to page 4 to get the result. I also miss the "GO" feature 
which took me directly to the page I wanted by entering in the correct 
name.

I know the idea is to tie the two together, and I'm not sure how to 
handle the search feature, but when I'm on the forum, I want an answer, 
any answer, but when I'm on the Codex, I often want an answer from the 
Codex, not a post on the forum. Maybe we can weight Codex results on top 
of forum and other results? I don't know how this works, but I was 
really frustrated, even when I typed in the specific title that I wanted.
