Subject: [wp-docs] Codex : linking to translated pages
Message-ID: <9e4ae73e0702020514jfad3af2i74adde3aaf8a4c14@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening,

We in the French community are used to pointing to the EN part of the
Codex. But there are more and more quality translations, or
equivalents, in the FR that we are not always aware of.
As WikiPedia allows linking to other versions of a given page, how is
it worked out in the Codex ? Is it implemented in the default Theme ?

Thanks.

The http://codex.wordpress.org/Template:Otherlanguages page would have
to be modified, perhaps taking a cue from wikipedia.

Another option is to work on building the
http://codex.wordpress.org/fr:Accueil page, listing all the French
pages there so that it becomes the page of choice for francophone
users to browse the codex.

Some of us are working on the FR Codex, and it is because their work
is of great value to our community, but seldom linked to because the
know-it-alls are used to refer to the EN versions, that I'd like the
translators to be able to tag EN versions with some equivalent to
WikiPedia's [[fr:TitreTraduit]] in order for the FR versions to get
linked from the EN originals, and thus get more exposure.
Is it already possible ? If not, I'm sure it can't be that hard to
implement, could it ?

The way wikipedia does it is they have en.wikipedia.org and then
fr.wikipedia.org - something we cannot do.

Writing and using a template tag to add a link to the page in French
is easy. What would be perfect is to have a template tag that tries to
find if there is a French page and adds a link only if it finds it,
and then adding this template tag to all pages. This seems difficult
to do. Also, the French pages have titles that are different from the
English equivalents, so not only do we have to find if an equivalent
page exists, but also find the title in French.

Therefore, it is best to manually add links to the equivalent French
page if it exists. I can whip up a mediawiki template that makes the
job easier (whether a template makes it easier, really, is an open
question :-) ).

Could you volunteer to find French equivalents to pages and then add
links to the pages? We could have a little div thingy below the title
of a page that has links to equiv. pages in other languages. It's a
lot of work - any other less-work-intensive suggestions are welcome.

Hey,

After several weeks of contributing to the Codex (quite a bit, if I do 
say so myself), I tried to edit a page today and found that I had been 
blocked. Can someone fix this? I can't add to anyone's "Talk" page 
since I am blocked... here is the message I got. It is odd, because 
whatismyip.com says that my IP address is  216.231.44.65 (we have a 
static IP). So I am not sure what is going on. I do not know anything 
about "programy".... has someone broken into my account or something?

Thanks for any help you can offer...
     Jennifer

Fixed.

Can't explain why the Codex Mediawiki is doing that--but it has happened
several times recently.

Have to make it a point to try not to inconvenience the larger Codex
contributors ;)

Thanks for your recent contributions!

Subject: [wp-docs] Structure of documentation
Message-ID: <757281720702210119sf62ff8g8feeb8e47cc1e852@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I'm new on this list, but has something I want to share with you.

I'm using Wordpress for about three years now, but decided last few
weeks to modify my weblog in various ways. I wrote some plugins and
themes in the past, but now I had to write some more advanced plugins
and a completely new theme. Because I wanted to do this 'the right
way', I decided to read the documentation on these subjects carefully.

I have to say that the documentation on Wordpress is very complete and
covers almost everything, which (I think) is a very good thing.
However, I think there is a rather big problem with the Wordpress
documentation, and that is its structure. It is very hard to find the
thing you're looking for. Especially when writing plugins I notice
this problem.

I have thought about this problem, and what's the cause of it. I think
there are several problems causing this rather chaotic structure.
1) Tutorials, howto's and reference documentation seems to be mixed
togheter. While tutorials and howto's can be useful in some cases,
they are distractive when you're looking for one particular function
or method.
2) The function reference (which is not easy to find, I only noticed
it after a while) is not structured very well. Currently, the
functions, options, classes are sorted by a (seemingly) random
categorization, which is not very obvious to understand (in my
opinion). For example, it took me some time to discover that the
databaseclass  was actual part of the function reference (its location
is not obvious). Another problem with the function reference is that
it is hard to navigate. A better navigation structure (in my opinion)
can be found at the function reference at php.net. It is easy to
navigate, the pages for individual functions are all structured the
same and you know where you have to look for a particular function.
3) The plugin API is documented very badly. With this, I'm referring
to the documentation on the action/filterhooks. This page is just a
long list, where a large number of the hooks isn't documented at all.
I think this is one of the most important parts of the developer
documentation of Wordpress. Good documentation on how to write plugins
is essential to lower the barrier for new developers.

I'm aware of the fact that Wordpress is an open source project and
that documentation is traditionally a difficult part of open source
projects. However, I think that Wordpress is doing very good on this
point and that the documentation is very complete. But I think that if
the structure of the documentation is improved, it can be a lot more
usable and make plugin and theme development easier.

The most important thing is seperate how-to's and tutorials from the
reference documentation. Additionally, a central page for plugin
development should be created. This page should containg links to a
clear function reference and actions/filter-hook reference. The
current page on plugin development is good, but more a tutorial. A
link to this page can be added as well (of course). The reference
documentation should be structured better, function reference should
follow a strict pattern.

Of course, I'm willing to help improve the documentation of Wordpress,
because I'm using it rather intensively and like the 'simplicity' of
it (creating plugins and themes is very easy to do).

Hi Martin,

You have made some good points, and I have actually been working on 
cleaning up the developer documentation along many of the same lines, 
but there is more to do. In answer to your specific points:

> 1) Tutorials, howto's and reference documentation seems to be mixed
> togheter. While tutorials and howto's can be useful in some cases,
> they are distractive when you're looking for one particular function
> or method.

Can you be more specific? I have been trying to make this separation 
on pages that I have edited, but if you have specific suggestions for 
pages that need to be broken up, that would be good.

> 2) The function reference (which is not easy to find, I only noticed
> it after a while) is not structured very well. [and most of the functions are not documented...]

It is definitely true that more of the functions need to be 
documented... but at least they are all listed now. The problem is 
that someone still needs to write about a zillion individual function 
pages, or at least add short descriptions to the functions. Feel free 
to jump in and write them. There is a standard structure for function 
documentation, so if you write a function reference page, start by 
copying an existing function doc page and go from there.

Also, can you suggest better categories? I would be happy to 
reorganize the list, and definitely functions can be listed in more 
than one section. For my first pass at getting all the functions at 
least listed, I just used the categories that were there previously. 
But there is no reason that it cannot be made better.

What other navigation features do you think would be good? You 
mentioned php.net as a good example -- what navigation features does 
it have that we should try to emulate, given that we are working 
within the WordPress Codex, which contains documentation for everyone 
from casual users to hard-core developers?

Again, someone needs to document them. Each one should have at least a 
  short description, but someone needs to write these descriptions. 
Please feel free to jump in...

The central place for plugin development exists:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation

Thanks for your input!

Message-ID: <45DC6012.2040906@poplarware.com>

(Whoops, sent this to the wrong list this morning... must not be quite 
awake yet)

So, it seemed like the banning from the Codex Wiki that I experienced
was pretty arbitrary -- the message on the screen referred to an IP
address that definitely wasn't mine. What software does the Codex use,
and should we (read "I") investigate/patch the banning logic to make
it a bit more intelligent? If it is arbitrarily banning people, it may
also be arbitrarily not banning spammers...

Thank you for your quick reply!

I will try to explain some of my points:

That's good to hear. As I already mentioned in my previous post, I am
willing to help restructure (and improve) the documentation.

One example I'm pointing at is the page 'Advanced Topics'. It is a
good thing to try to cover a broad range of 'advance' topics on one
page, but the problem with this page is that it is a mix of reference
pages and tutorials/HowTo's. I noticed this problem on other pages as
well. Some links on this page are to pages which aren't 'advanced' at
all (such as the 'Wordpress Plugin' link). On the other hand, is there
also a link to the plugin API on this page. Another link here is the
'Managing plugins' page, but in fact that is not 'advanced' that is
just end-user documentation.

It may be better to make a seperate page with 'reference
documentation', on which the function reference and Plugin API is
listed (amongst other pages), and a seperate page with 'advanced
topics' where only tutorials/howto-like pages are linked.

Maybe it is not clear for which audience a particular page is written.
For example: http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin and
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API contain a lot information which
is on both pages. But they both seems to be mentioned for the same
audience and try to achieve the same goal...

While I'm looking more careful to the available documentation, the
structure isn't as bad as I thought, but is more a navigational
problem.

It is not obvious where to find the documentation you're looking for.
Until today, I didn't noticed the Developer Doc page, because I
expected that on that page was information on how to contribute on
Wordpress, and not the developers references (which it is).

The Documentation Home Page (http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page) is
another example of a really bad page (and maybe the cause of my
problem?). As a 'new' Wordpress user who's looking for some
information, this page is just to overwhelming. There are a zillion
links on this page, and a lot of them seems to be duplicate or cover
the same topic. I think, this page should be a clear starting point
and provide guidance where to find particular documentation.

For example, take a look at the first four links:
1. Getting Started with WordPress <- ok, clear, if I'm new I have to
start here...
2/ New To WordPress - Where to Start <- err.. what's the difference
with the previous link?
3. WordPressMU and WordPress.com <- not really relevant I think.. at
least not here
4. Installation <- ok, if I want to install Wordpress, I have to look here ...
5. Installation Help <- ... or here?

I think it is clear that this is not very 'userfriendly'.

I'm not aware of the history of this page, but according to your
reaction, I assume that in the past there was not such a reference. In
that case, this is already a big improvement. I understand that one of
the problems is missing description of functions, and of course that
is not 'easy' to fix (however, if I have some time left, I will try to
help to fix this problem).

I have not yet thought of a better categorization of this page, but I
will look at it and come with a suggestion if I have one. However, I
think it is not optimal at the moment, some categories (especially the
'Miscellanous Functions') are very long. The page would also improve
if there is some kind of 'overview' at the beginning. The only way to
find a category now is to scroll down the page.

I think a good start is to clean up existing 'overview' pages and
think of some kind of structure for the documentation. Currently, it
feels like there is not really a structure in the pages.

Yes, I didn't notice that page...

Hi Martin,

Excellent!

a) Rewriting the "Writing a Plugin" article was already at the top of 
my To Do list. I might have time later this week. It is definitely a 
bit disorganized, and it should reference (rather than duplicate) the 
Plugin API article.

b) I totally agree that there are a ton of pages that loop around 
endlessly when you are trying to find documentation... believe me, the 
situation was worse a month or two ago! But it still needs 
improvement. I've been focusing my efforts on improving the 
organization of the developer-related documentation, removing 
duplicated information, making central places to look for information, 
etc. But more does need to be done. I've made notes of your specific 
points, but you can feel free to jump in and improve things too.

c) Function Reference:
> I'm not aware of the history of this page, but according to your

There was a reference page before, but it was missing about 75% of the 
functions. Jump in and add documentation and organization at will! 
Please! :) You also mentioned some kind of Table of Contents -- the 
Wiki makes it easy to add links down the page, so that can be added 
too. Good idea!

d) Here are 3 places that I think need more documentation in the 
developer reference area, if you want to help:

1) Function Reference - each function should at least have a short 
description, and better yet a documentation page. Better categories 
might be useful too, or maybe listing functions in more categories.

2) Template Tags - add the rest of the functions from the 
*-template.php files, so that the lists are complete, and document 
functions that are lacking documentation currently. Right now, only a 
subset of the functions are on the page, and it seems quite arbitrary. 
Note that some functions are on separate pages (like the Conditional 
Tags and the Include Tags).

3) Hooks list - document these hooks, perhaps organize them into 
categories?

Hello Martin and Jennifer,

I have also recently started using Wordpress and developing plugins for it
as well. I really like the features of Wordpress and how clean and smooth it
is.  I did however have some of the same problems that Martin did in finding
documentation.  In writing a couple of plugin's, which I hope to release
once I clean them up enough, I had a couple of ideas which I was thinking of
working on and contributing to the documentation.

1.  A complete plugin example that is "perfect" in the eyes of Wordpress and
if followed you will write excellent plugin's.  What I am thinking is
perfect syntax, layout, code style,  and documentation.  The document has
snippets of code, but not a complete example.  I typically follow example
code when learning a new system, and didn't know what was good plugin code
and bad plugin code in the eyes of the Wordpress development team.

2.  A 10 step guide (or how ever many steps are required) to writing a
plugin.  The writing a plugin page is a great start, but I was wanting to
create my own table, and build a management page to manage that data.  This
is where I had to download a couple of other plugin's as examples and hope
they are good examples of plugin style.

As an example of the steps:

Step 1. Setup the meta information.  Give example how to you construct the
author info, author URL, description etc.

Step 2. Define your table definition and build the install function.

Step 3. Write functions to display your data on a website.

Step 4. Administration functions.  How to add, edit and delete data.

Step 5. Hooks and Filters.  How to hook your plugin into the Wordpress
engine.

Step 6. Localization.  How to localize your code.

Step 7. Documentation.  How best to document your plugin so other's can use
it.

I'm not sure if this is just a reorganization of existing information, or if
it's something that should be written from scratch?  I would be glad to help
out with this if you would like.  Having just written my first plugin's it's
all still fresh in my mind.

Thanks for all the great existing docs and spending your time working on
them, it's very much appreciated.

Thanks!
Andrew.

Hi Andrew,

I think the place to put a better description of the steps to writing 
a plugin is the existing "Writing a Plugin" article, which definitely 
needs a rewrite. I was going to do it, within a week or two, but if 
you want to, please feel free (let me know if you plan to do this, so 
we don't both work on it at once).

There are also a couple of better (than the existing article) 
references linked at the bottom of Writing a Plugin. I think at least 
one of them does pretty much what you suggested -- goes through step 
by step with complete code given.

Also note that there are other plugin-related articles that go into 
details of some of the steps you are talking about. So my suggestion 
would be to have an overview of those steps in "Writing a Plugin", and 
link to the articles with the details. For example, don't go into 
detail about Filters and Actions, just mention and link to the "Plugin 
API"  article.  You will obviously need to become familiar with the 
articles that are out there, so you don't waste a lot of time 
reinventing the wheel.

Regarding a complete plugin example, I think there are plenty of 
plugin examples out there, and I do not think that the article really 
needs to have the complete plugin code in it, since there are so many 
places to download plugins. Style is good; there is an article in the 
Codex about WordPress programming style, so probably it's not 
necessary to expound on that a lot in "Writing a Plugin".

Let me know how you are planning to proceed....

I think it can be of value to write an article based on the complete
creation of a plugin. You simply shouldn't use a very complex plugin I
think. The current "Writing a Plugin" article could easily transformed
into this, by adding some sample code. Let me now when one of you has
finished this article, maybe I can read it and provide some feedback.
I think the writing of plugins is the most common 'development' task,
so good documentation on this part is important.

Last night, I was wondering why the function reference is generated
from the source? I saw somewhere some guidelines on in-code
documentation, but apparently, this is not used to create
documentation. I am also a Java developer, and have some experience
with JavaDoc. In the past I used PHPDoc (or PHPDocumenter or
something, I'm not sure about that) and that was similar to JavaDoc. I
think it is possible to create JavaDoc-like documentation in the
WordPress source, and generate (at least a large part of) the function
reference. It has multiple benefits:
1) Function definition and parameters doesn't have to be copy/paste
(reducing errors)
2) It is easier for developers to keep the documentation up-to-date,
because it can be done at the same place where the actual change in
code is done.
3) The source code is documented properly (I haven't investigate this
thoroughly, but some quick checks seems to suggest that there is not
much documentation in the source code.

I realize that creating function reference this way, takes some work,
but one the long take, maintaining the function reference is much
easier.

Wow. The WordPress Codex is using version 1.4.8, but the current 
version of MediaWiki is 1.9.3. Are there any plans to upgrade? I do 
not think it is worth investigating the banning problem on such an old 
version if upgrading would (possibly) fix the problem.

I believe this has been suggested before. The benefits you cited are 
clear, but given the current state of affairs, I can think of a couple 
of counter-arguments:

a) Currently, very few of the functions in WordPress have any 
documentation in the code, much less properly formatted xxDoc 
comments, while many functions (especially the "Template Tags") have 
Codex pages.

b) Anyone can edit the Codex to contribute documentation, and it will 
be up on the site immediately. Adding documentation to the code (or 
fixing it) requires submitting a patch and waiting for a new version 
of WordPress to come out, assuming the patch is accepted. Plus, the 
special documentation comment might not be well-formed enough to 
generate the documentation, which would then require a new patch and 
another release cycle before it is up on the Codex.

c) You do not necessarily get good documentation from developers.

Documentation can be generated from code even without the doc comments.
It would be useful to have pages auto-generated for every function as it
would at least give a starting point for documenters to add to.

There may be functions that the developers prefer to be less visible and
undocumented, but these can be removed after the auto-generation.

I could generate a bunch of function based docs quite easily, but I have
no idea how to wiki-ize them.

> c) You do not necessarily get good documentation from developers.

Very true, but you do get an accurate starting point from which the 
"professional" documentors can embellish and refine.

As an aside, why is the codex search facility so bad? And why doesn't it
search the function reference pages?

In giving this more thought, I was thinking there should be three different
documents.  1. Writting a simple plugin.  I was going to use a random quote
plugin as an example, where the quotes are stored in the plugin file.  The
second document would then modify that plugin to store the information in
the database, and add administration pages.  The third document would add
ajax support to the administration pages to make the editing process
easier/more advanced.

I've just signed up to Codex, so I'll read the documentation on how to write
documentation and then hopefully get started in the next couple of weeks.
I'll let you know when I have something put together.

Thanks,
Andrew.

I'm aware of this argument (and was expecting it), and it is certainly
true. But, it doesn't require a release to generate new documentation
(I suppose). It may even be possible to create a seperate branch and
add the documentation to it. I suspect that the most important API
functions will not change very much every release (because that would
break plugins and templates).

As Mark Styles suggests, generating the documentation from the source
doesn't mean you have a 'complete' documentation at once. Most
implementations of document generators also work when there is no
specific formatted comments in the source code, but generate 'document
templates' containing the name of the function, its arguments and
(maybe) the return value. Also is it possible (in the case of
objects/classes) to automatically add links to parent classes.
This generated documentation could form a starting point for most of
the functions (there are a lot functions not documented currently, as
you pointed out).

I have to point out that it is just a new idea I had, and I haven't
worked it out entirely, but I suspect that, if we want it, it is
possible to realise this. I think it will improve also make it easier
to improve the quality of code (some files of the Wordpress source
contain pretty bad code) because maintaining the documentation
enforced developers to think about their changes.

If the documentation in the source is enforced (just like the 'coding
style guidelines'), it will be possible to keep this up-to-date (other
open source projects are doing it as well, why would it be impossible
in this project?). I understand that it require some effort. I suspect
it is possible to give someone who is coordinator of this project, can
be given rights to commit the documentation to the source, or at least
manage the patches in trac (and pass them to the person who can commit
them in a 'ready' way). Again, I don't think it is only possible to
update the documentation when a release is happening. It would be
stupid to only update the reference documentation when there is a
release.

>
> c) You do not necessarily get good documentation from developers.

True, but some developers can write good documentation (or at least
update it). Maybe I'm not clear at this point, but I think the initial
source documentation should be written by a documenter. I don't expect
the current developers creating this documentation.

One think that could be a 'problem' is how we can generate
documentation in a format which can be put on the Codex. This morning,
I looked at PHPdocumentor (a Pear project) and I think it is possible
to use this package to generate documentation which can be put on the
Codex (which is just a wiki as far as I understand). The PHP
documentation is also generated from the sourcecode documentation (as
far as I understand).

We have discussed this twice (or thrice) before, on this list and on
the wp-hackers list. Please peruse those old threads to see why this
idea was not implemented.

Thank you for your suggestions :) Good to see action on this list again!

Upgrading Mediawiki is a royal PITA from past experience. The Images
will stop showing, the special pages will stop working, the namesapces
will stop working.... some of it due to the problem that unlike
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MainPage we have
http://codex.wordpress.org/MainPage/  Had we known better earlier, we
would have put in a /wiki/ in the URL too.

There have been discussions about using a different kind of wiki.
Nothing much came of it. I blame it on inertia caused by the weight of
so many pages and contributions.

Really, upgrading to the latest and greatest is not essential, unless
the upgrade provides some will-die-for feature. Security is a concern,
I admit, and as long as we have that covered, we should be good for
now.

I want to make it clear that I am a developer, and I think the idea of 
having the functions documented in the code is the Right Thing To Do.

I also want to make it clear that I am not a decision maker in 
WordPress, just an Interested Participant.

So... I was thinking about this idea of having the WordPress PHP code 
being the source for Codex function documentation pages from a 
practical perspective, and I do not think it is practical right now... 
or at least, here are the practical concerns that I would want to see 
addressed in a reliable, workable way, before such a plan was implemented:

* Figure out how to get the existing function documentation from the 
Codex Function Reference, Template Tags, and associated pages into the 
code.

* Figure out standards for function headers that would translate to 
good function documentation pages, and find or write code to extract 
all the function documentation and put it into the Codex (or another 
web site).

* Figure out a way to make it easy for both developers and 
non-developers to be able to edit the documentation and submit their 
changes.

* Figure out a way to have documentation released on a schedule that 
is not necessarily connected to the WordPress release schedule (i.e. 
so updates to documentation could be put onto the site immediately).

Very good recommendations all around. I've been trying to get these 
sections improved and expanded for a very long time. Thanks to all.

As for the issue of showing the example of a "well-written" Plugin, this 
is of critical importance. 
http://guff.szub.net/2006/04/06/my-widget-example-wordpress-widget/ has 
a brilliant example of the ideal Widget code. If we set the standard by 
example of the proper, step-by-step outline of a Plugin, it will be 
followed to the letter. This is what happened with the Default WordPress 
Theme. A majority of all WordPress Themes are based upon it, buggy code 
and all.

People like shortcuts and if we give them a solid foundation shortcut, 
they will perpetuate the good and not the bad.

As for the rest of the earlier comments on Codex structure, the front 
page is under serious reconstruction behind the scenes to make it more 
user friendly. The WordPress Lessons section is the "tutorial" section, 
though in the early days we were less disciplined about keeping 
documentation out of it and tutorials out of documentation since we had 
so few documents to work with. I'll be cleaning that up very soon, too.

I'm leaving the Developer Docs and Advanced Topic section to you guys 
for now, since I want to concentrate on structure, TOC, and tutorials. 
I'm also going to be working on adding some great new features over the 
next few months. Be patient. ;-)

A while ago I created an outline for the structure of the Codex which 
still holds water in many ways.

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_Wanted

Please take a look at it, especially in the documentation areas, to see 
if there is some helpful structure and ideas there. It's dated, but may 
help.

Sounds good -- I will hold off on editing the Writing a Plugin file 
and leave it to you. :)

Meantime, I am going to do another pass at making the dev 
documentation easier to locate in general, and I am also going to add 
a central "Plugin Resources" annotated list to the Codex, as ONE 
central place to go for plugins.

I'm not sure if it is desirable to use the php source of Wordpress as
to one and only documentation source for the reference. Maybe I didn't
make this clear enough in my previous posts.
Because of the nature of the Codex (a wiki, which means that everybody
can modify it at will) it would be almost impossible (I guess) to keep
the source code documentation and the Wiki-reference documentation in
sync.

I don't think it is very smart to invent such a format again. As I
mentioned before, there is already the JavaDoc/PHPDocumenter format,
which is widely used and considered as a standard for this.

I did some experimentation this afternoon, and discovered it is pretty
easy to generate 'templates' for the function reference using
PHPDocumentor (http://www.phpdoc.org) which can be directly used on
the Codex. By default PHPDoc generates HTML documentation, but with
little effort it is possible to write a 'Convertor' for this package,
which format the documentation in MediaWiki-tags. I have already a
Convertor which makes a templatedocumentation for functions, including
the functionname, parameters, default values for parameters, return
value and so on. When there is a so-called DocBlock (i.e. comments in
JavaDoc format) this is automatically included in the template.

I have created a list of plugin references page, similar to 
"Templates" in the Codex:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_Resources

Andrew, if you are rewriting "Writing a Plugin", you may find some 
pages of interest there to link to in your updated article. :)

Regarding the original question about documentation structure, I've 
linked this list of plugin resources on several pages (such as 
"Plugins"), so hopefully a potential plugin developer can now at least 
find it. :)

Suggestions/edits welcome... I'm going to see if I can clean up more 
of the spaghetti of pages of links leading to more pages of links now 
(leaving the Codex home page as is until Lorelle finishes her update)...

I will look if I have some time the coming days to improve the
function reference, and try to add at least a basic page for every
function and complete the list of functions.

I think it is not realistic to expect that automatic generation of
documentation for the function reference is possible in a short amount
of time, so I will use the current system.

I think it is useful to think about a system for generating a function
reference based on the WP source in the future, but that will require
some input of the lead developers/documenters.

Who is in charge of the "Extend" page that you get to from the 
WordPress top nav menu -- http://wordpress.org/extend/   I think it 
could use some work.

a) Home page -- the text is all about themes, how about something 
about plugins as well (see c below for suggestions)

b) Click on Themes, and you get "Featured Themes"
       http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/
(which I don't think has been updated in a while). How about instead 
giving users a list of these links:
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes (intro to themes, how to 
use and install, and how to find them)
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Templates (comprehensive list of theme 
resources)

c) Click on Plugins and you get nothing useful. The links are out of 
date and not the best ones to view there... how about instead writing 
a short page that sends users to the following:
     http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins (how to install and 
use plugins)
     http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins (how to find plugins)
     http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_Resources  (comprehensive 
resource list)

Just a thought --

The "Extend" page on wordpress.org was to be a replacement for 
wp-plugins.net when that was having trouble. The "rumors" I last heard 
was to either incorporate the two or some volunteers would be in charge 
of "cleaning" the plugins in wp-plugins.net or submitted to them so they 
would be "officialized" and tested for WordPress users. That idea is way 
too heavy to implement without paid staff, IMHO. WP-Plugins.net needs 
serious work, too, but I'm working with them to get that cleaned up and 
possibly get more volunteers working in that direction.

There will be more news on that coming out soon.

Send me refreshed content (html) and I will review to try and see if
it is in the same voice and work on getting it deployed. Otherwise, I
will try and find time to do it myself, but It may be a while.

One of the Codex's challenges is that the content is overly thorough
and does not have enough pictures ;-) My guess is part of the problem
is that the same documents are trying to serve to many audiences.

I think Matt is working with someone on a decent plugin repository.

Cheers,
