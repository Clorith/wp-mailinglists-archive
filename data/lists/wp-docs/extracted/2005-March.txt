After deleting a page, I get an "Internal Error" message, however, the page 
deletes as expected. If I try to restore a deleted page, I get the same message, 
but the page does NOT restore.

Any other Codex issues? Report them here, please.

Message-ID: <422408F5.2040301@nuclearmoose.com>

I just did a major bit of work on the Plugin pages. The list of plugins was 
getting huge, and the wiki software recommended that it be broken up into 
manageable chunks.

What I did was to take the sections on the page and create a sub-page with that 
section name. I also created a template, {{PluginIndex}} that I used on the 
bottom of every category page. The template is simply a link back to the main 
Plugin page.

So, any plugin should now be placed within an appropriate category, and should 
NOT get its own page.

Also, during the Codex down time, a lot of cruft has made its way into the 
pages. Specifically, apostrophes and other punctuation marks have randomly been 
turned into gibberish. All of the plugin pages need a thorough edit for typos 
and this nastiness.

Also, there are many dead links, so if we could do some URL hunting, that would 
be good.

Check out the new look:

I think the cruft you mention could the result of a change in the
charset setting.
The {{Stub}} template is missing in action.

Right,

Let's fix these wherever we find them. I removed the strings from the
misspelled words list, since it is truly a misspelled words list -
does not account for phrases or for capitalization, and was flagging
wrong pages at the typos page.

And it's not "WorldPress", either. And "WordPerfect" is right out.

I haven't seen those on the Codex, but they have been spotted in the wild.

Some well-meaning people have put in some new pages, but unfortunately the 
content is mostly duplicated (IMO) and also they have plans to make "individual 
pages for plugins" as things develop. Too much work. Plugins can be linked and a 
short description done, but no way can we afford to have to try and maintain 
everything about plugins. That's the job of the authors on their own sites. 
Codex should only point to the resource.

We need to get the word out about people getting on to this list. We also need 
to remind people (in a friendly way, of course) that in order to save a lot of 
work, they need to read and follow the guidelines.

Not a great word, but it's all I could think of at the moment. In the recent 
past, I had a discussion with a well-respected WP community member who was 
adamant that our "create a new page as a sub page of your USER page" was a bad 
idea. I am already seeing some people jumping in and creating new pages, 
seemingly without reading/following the guidelines.

Is this a dumb "policy"? I'm pretty much the one that suggested it and set up 
the reminder template that sits in most peoples' TALK page.

I expected to address this question in this document here:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2005-February/000007.html
(please read the thread).

I proposed something, as outlined in that thread, and then it was that
many people involved in documentation did not respond to it, or
provide suggestions for improvement.

I understand that you had a discussion with some individual, but if
that individual has a real interest in how documentation develops,
then it might be good for him to provide feedback when asked, or start
a new discussion regarding it.

We need to move forward, steadily, with a set of specifications and
agreed-upom standards, and the only way to arrive at a consensus is to
provide feedback.

I have some pressing work tomorrow, when I am done, I am going to
finalize the proposal and move that into the guidelines, keeping in
mind the suggestions provided by others who replied to that thread. If
you (Craig) or anyone else has suggestions, please reply to that
thread.

Again, I beleive that frustrating users by not reviewing and moving in
pages is not going to help.

I have a simple method of dealing with cruft - remove it as soon as
you see it with a note explaining why. Redundant work, and aimless
documentation serve no purpose.

If it is their desire to have pages describing their plugins as a
useb-page of their user page, then in my opinion we should not stop
that. This will preserve sanity in the Main: namespace and provide
resource to those who want to maintain a set of pages explaining their
contributions to the community. Ideally, a note should be left on the
User's page describing wp-plugins.org and requesting them to use that
resource to host the plugin as well as the accompanying documentation
for the plugin.

Maybe we can add an announcement on the front page regarding the
resurrection of the wp-docs mailing list? (I would do it, but I am
busy atm)

Sounds good to me. Let us re-use one of the existing Codex: pages to
maintain the To-do list. A to-do list is a good thing to have, even
when there is no wikiday.

To be honest, I've never liked the idea, simply because it's so 
contrary to the concept behind a wiki. Seems to me that a certain 
amount of pruning and maintenance comes with the territory, and it 
should be up to the bureaucrats and sysadmins to keep duplicate content 
in check and flag pages for improving if they don't fit within the 
guidelines.

To draw the usual comparison, Wikipedia doesn't have a similar policy, 
and they manage quite well. Perhaps if the job is too large for the 
current staff of admins, more admins should be appointed to balance the 
load, rather than implementing guidelines which, while they're 
well-meaning, restrict the openness of the wiki platform.

The idea of not putting pages into production until they're finished is 
a nice one in theory, but on wikis, where there is never a final draft, 
I think it serves only to deter other users from contributing to the 
unfinished pieces. Not only that, but I'm sure that hiding drafts in 
the privacy of user pages actually contributes to duplicate 
information, since they have very low visibility.

I agree with Morgan, especially on the point of duplicating content.
With all of the complaints of late regarding orphaned pages, why on
Earth should policy suggest that you create - by definition - an 
orphaned User: page for any codex content?

There should be a policy about how site cohesion is maintained (which
pages stay and how they're organized), but the policy should be drafted
in a Machiavellian "you see it -- you fix it" way.  My current distaste
for being slapped around by admins for adding original useful content in
a method contrary to their tastes but valid by common sense discourages
me from contributing much.  If this makes /me/ less inclined to 
contribute, I can only imagine the barrier for folks who are hesitant 
from the start.  This is primarily why I don't contribute to Codex as 
often as I might.

There are also problems with the review process in the New Page policy. 
   For one, nobody follows it - I have seen zero new page review
requests go by on this mailing list, ever.  Also, the policy does not
mention what signals the final decision on a valid title.  Is there a
quorum?  How do you know what a quorum is on a mailing list?  And who
does the moving from a User: page to live content when the decision is
finally made?  Let's not mention that doing it this way will take months
for a single contentious page at the rate this list debates minutia.

So, never complain without proposing a solution:  Craft a policy that
allows Codex's users to build Codex.  Build into that policy a review
process that uses the RSS feed of new pages
(http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Special:Newpages&feed=rss)
rather than using the mailing list.  The policy should be expanded to
describe maintenance tasks, like marking pages as incomplete, orphaned,
in need of technical review, etc.  All users should be empowered to make
changes directly to pages to bring them in-line with policy, and
annotate the required change on the Talk page.  This is not to imply
that admin privileges be granted, just that the policy encourages users
to take organization and editing into their own hands.  Gross error or
contested title/location?  Mark it for review by an admin who can bring 
it up on this list or make a decision outright (but we'll need markers 
and instructions on how to apply them).  Otherwise, just let people 
create content.

I get the feeling that list members don't contribute to these policy
discussions because they fear cheesing people off.  I'm just airing my
personal grievances with Codex, which are as (in)valid as anyone else's,
and hopefully useful to those whom they concern.  When policy is in
stone, I'll invite you all out for beer.

Hi, there!

My name is tai. Thank you very much for the docs.

We some
Japanese users have a plan to translate the Codex into Japanese, but we're
not sure under what kind of license the Codex is. So could anyone tell me
what license it is, or should I get permission to translate it from someone?


Regards,
tai

The codex is under GPL just like WordPress.

I expected to address the question by following up my last message on 
the topic ("Re: [wp-docs] New Codex Page for Forum Go-ers", 
2005-01-07). It seems the archive of pre-February posts to the list has 
been lost, but the salient point of my message was this:

I planned to wait a month after the guideline change, so I could 
compare the number of pages created in the main namespace in the month 
beforehand with the number created in the month afterward. That way, I 
would have hard evidence for or against my hypothesis that the 
guideline change would maim the main namespace.

Unfortunately for that experiment (though, I think, fortunately for 
Codex), the wp-docs mailing list died shortly thereafter. So people had 
no choice but to ignore the guideline.

I believe I'm "that individual", and I'm sorry, I didn't receive that 
thread at all (and so in the absence of a sufficiently flexible mail 
client, I can't reply to it either).

Anyway, if you wish to revive a review process for new Codex pages, I 
suggest first reading about what happened to Nupedia.

Hi Owen,

I tried to get a start on New Page policy discussion in an early
thread [1] that I mentioned on this thread earlier. While it continues
to the use the sub-page-of-userpage system, it specifies how new pages
will be created/named and so answers at least a few of the questions
you ask in this mail. Would you care to comment/improve on that thread
I started. Feedback is always welcome. Once we can reach an agreement,
we can avoid frequent re-discussions of old topics of this kind, and
move forward with the tasks at hand.

Thanks,

Carthik,

I don't have a problem with many of the points mentioned regarding 
naming policies and standards.  My main concern is the implementation of 
that policy.

Empower the users as editors.  Add to these standards a list of special 
tags (like {{Stub}}) that can be applied to pages that need review by 
someone more knowledgeable, and explain to authors how and when to use them.

Leave heftier operations - like merging, splitting, and moving - to 
admins.  Let users mark these pages for admin review and tasking.

One specific point to add to the standards is that links that go nowhere 
should be allowed and *not removed*.  They provide a placeholder for 
people to find things to work on.  If they're such a problem for users 
who find blank pages and don't know what to do, let's create a better 
"This is not written yet" message.

I also want to reiterate that I think that it's very inconvenient, 
counter-wiki, admin-intensive - choose your adjective - to insist on 
User: pages.  It creates a lot more work for everyone in the end, and 
doesn't appear to me to substantially increase the quality of the content.

Your original message is not in this email client, which is not a 
surprise to me.  It is likely related to my misuse of pop3, rather than 
a list-server issue.

Owen

When I'm at the codex I'm usually trying to do some hackin, not sniff
the flowers. Flowers are distracting because the smell nice, much like
women. Women and flowers in the logo are to be avoided at all cost,
productivity will drop tenfold.

Message-ID: <80f75db050303073929feea31@mail.gmail.com>

I personally think that comparisons with Nupedia, and Wikipedia ought
to stop at some point. There a few critical differences:

1. There is only one possible new page title in Wikipedia, and that is
the name of the person/thing/place/technique/object being described on
the page. In the Codex, we have to decide the name sensibly, before a
new page gets linked-to from all over the web.

2. Wikipedia has a lot more volunteers. With 3-5 people admining and
about 40 contributing to the codex, with no one doing this as anything
but a part-time task, we have a tough time pruning and maintaining our
work of art.

3. Leaving links to new pages that are yet to be created is good,
until someone starts clicking them and making stub-pages with maybe a
line or two of text, so we will have 'n' pages describing the same
thing, since I don't expect the links to nonexisting pages to all be
the same everywhere.

More admins, with well defined roles might be a solution at a later time.

If you were to compare our effort to that of the huge popular, and
acclaimed, Gentoo documentation project, then there are a few things
we can learn from it - a bugtracker, and non-wiki based documentation.

In my opinion, what we need is a wiki, but with some amount of control
of what the page titles and the organization will be. Nothing new
here.

Carthik.

It is probably because "nofollow" should have been "Nofollow".
Mediawiki does not seem to like page titles with an initial lowercase
letter.

Subject: [wp-docs] Files missing from a lot of Themes
Message-ID: <001b01c5205a$ed451440$6501a8c0@silver>

Challenged by missing files in a few of the Themes I've been downloading, I asked a question on the forums at http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=26038 and found out that by default, if a file is missing but called from the theme, it picks it up from the default theme.  The problem comes in styling conflicts, if there are or aren't styles within those files.

Specifically, I found some Themes missing comment files, but there may be others missing.

1. We need to put this information in the Codex anywhere that involves developing or designing themes.

2. Anywhere that discusses or instructs on themes needs to have this information - I'm talking about source code documentation, external websites, wherever we can think of.

3. Information for those hosting Theme contests or design contests which involve Themes need to make sure that designers either include all the basic files or allow for CSS that adjusts the default files they leave out.

I'm jumping on this because of the contest currently running and because of the bazillions wanting to get into the Theme biz and grabbing info from the Codex.  It's got to be really clear.

I was told to post the following list here to help editors find any articles I've written or worked on.

The following two "articles" are complete rewrites of the similar pages.  They required a lot of re-work.  Plugins has now been revised, but I'm sure that some of the information I've provided may be helpful.

Make a stub that appears on discussion pages and have it direct all
support to the forums. Problem (somewhat) solved.

Yep, they are great. My suggestion is a Lessons page with each major topic as a 
sub page.

Then, copy/paste, and do the copy editing to capture all of the ooey-gooey goodness.

I want to first emphasize that what follows are not meant to be pointed 
remarks; I have a great deal of respect for all those working on Codex 
and for the admins/sysops in particular.  That said, I do not plan on 
making further contributions until the creating new pages policy has 
been finalized _and implemented_.

I have made every effort to follow the guidelines.  These efforts have 
resulted in great success (as in the Pages article), and great 
frustration (as in every other article in my User space - even after 
announcing them here on this list).  I understand the desire to have 
people create pages in their User space; it gives some extra control to 
the sysops etc. in what gets included.  It is also exceedingly slow, at 
least at the moment.  Many people are creating new pages now, and there 
are still the same number of (hard working) "upper-echelon" Codex 
contributors.  I'm offering no alternative solution here, since I have 
not the time nor the desire to pull more authority on Codex, I'm just 
point out a flaw everyone already knows about.

Also, under the "User space" system, duplication of effort is very 
easy.  If this User space system continues, I would suggest asking 
people to suggest ideas for new pages on this list _before_ starting 
one in their User space (rather than the other way around) so that 
duplication can be avoided.

People should also not be afraid to say "that page you created is not 
useful; it will not be included in the Main space"  Closure is good, 
even if the answer is not the one sought.

As things progress, I'll work these up into entries in the Codex, so don't 
worry, they won't be lost.  We're still looking for more info on some of the 
lessons, like the Loop (examples of a lot of variations, especially using 
excerpts or custom results), how to modify WordPress to be "more" 
accessible, things "designers" should know for contests and otherwise for 
themes, and lessons on the various topics listed at 
http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=25428. So if anyone wants to 
volunteer a little expert-itis, it would help.  I don't want to put these in 
prematurely, and I want people to really participate.

Also, I know it doesn't apply here, but these would also be better served if 
they are to continue and expand, in a section on the Forum called "Lessons" 
or "Tutorials" or something more specific than "How-to".  This way the Codex 
could have a dedicated culling opportunity!

I just discovered the "wanted pages" special page in the Codex and saw that 
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Codex:Help&action=edit called 
Codex:Help has 144 links to it.  WHAT?  There is nothing there.  Is this 
another capitalization error or wrong info?  With that many links, there's a 
problem needing fixing.  A redirect would help to the "right" page.

I'm sure that some of these empty links come from improper link titles or 
capitlization issues.  I have tons of them as I'm writing, so I have to 
check them all the time.  Not always but many times I'll change the case of 
the link and it will link to a "create a new page" instead of the one I 
want.  I go back and change the cap and it goes to the right page. 
Frustrating.  Not all work that way, but enough to make a person nuts.

Per request, I and others have cleaned up the dead end pages, but there are 
some there that related to international issues and 1.2 stuff.  I think the 
PTB need to check to see how those should link within the Codex to "finish 
them off for good."

MDAWaffe,

First thing I do today is to move in your pages, right now, where I
see them fit, and as we have discussed before.

No problem if it is pointed, we are all accountable.

Things move a little too slowly with voluntary projects, but there is
a definite progress, in how the docs are now, as opposed to how they
were earlier. Things are more organized and the quality seems to be a
little better, if not a lot.

Let me see what I can do about it, a few more hours from my part
should help. Personally, I was quite pre-occupied with other work, so
haven't been able to put in as much effort as I would like.
I have made a decision to not create any new pages myself till all the
maintenance work is complete.

Good suggestion. But announcing it on this list may have problems,
like the other person working on a similar page might not read it.
Ideally, new pages should be moved in asap, so collaboration can be
maximized.

Yes. I agree with you.

To end this reply, please do not stop writing, I really appreciate
your work, as do a lot of other folks. The "Pages" page was excellent,
I am sure you put in more than 5 hours into it. Please do not feel
discouraged. Can you please help with creating task-oriented
documentation that derives from your Admin Panel pages?

Thank you for bringing your concerns to light,
Carthik.

You know, I gave this a lot of thought and for the most part, I agree with
Michael.  I've had a few articles in my user section for a while and no
comments or activity that anyone has touched them.  Not that mine are as
important as the ones Michael has been doing - I'm dependent upon those to
help me understand how WordPress works and I've been all over them.

Do we need more "editors" or is there something else going on that has
slowed down this project?  What's really happening here?  Or is the process
not working as planned?

Is there a list of User Pages so we can start editing on them, if this is 
the hold-up?

Michael, on a personal note, I find your help in the Codex and the forums
invaluable.  Amazing amount of work you've done and it is all critical to
the success of the documentation.  Try not to give up on the project when
the doc mailing list just got started again and things are starting to
happen with the new release of 1.5.  Patience, please.  If they don't need
you, I, as a user, need you.  Just dump your brilliant brain right out for
everyone to use, please!

I'd like to do a very simple article for the Codex on how to get started, something to expand upon the links from the "Getting Started with WordPress" on the main page and to be simplier than the http://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging article.  Very basic with links to the different help pages available.

Is there something like that in the Codex already?  I've been a-searchin'.

<<snipped a lot of very good stuff>>

Stick with it Michael, and for a couple of reasons:
- your work is brilliant, it really is. You have done wonders for Codex 
and I'd hope you don't lose sight of that.

- remember I proposed wiki day ? And then promptly dropped off the Codex 
planet ? Most of the reasons were - and are - personal - but it was also 
that wiki day took off. People such as yourself came in, hit the ground 
running and Codex began changing. As someone who like Carthik and Craig 
had been plugging away at it or months, this new work didn't seem to fit 
with what I thought Codex should be.
This wasn't a formal thing we'd agreed anywhere, it's just that with any 
project you work on, you begin to feel you know it, you feel some 
ownership and all these wiki day people altered things so much that I 
was thrown out of my own little loop. I commented to someone around that 
time that Codex was so busy and people seemed to know just what they 
were doing that I didn't quite know what to do - so I didn't (with Codex 
anyway).
I have watched though, got the feed, cheered when the docs list came 
back - and everything isn't just good, it's great, and you Michael are 
one of the people who has made it that way.

A new page, http://codex.wordpress.org/Defining_Relationships_with_XFN
has been created. I attempted to make it more wordpress-centric and to
explain the importance of XFN. Now we can edit it, and modify it to
suit our needs. Edit mercilessly!

Cool, with a little more time contribution by people, and with a
better framework, things should be simpler.

Maybe we need more editors - yes, but it is important that the editors
get the picture, and the picture will get clearer soon.
What's happening right now, is we are trying to make the "create new
pages as a sub page of your user: page" system work efficiently. The
implementation is having some problems, and maybe things will have to
be worked out a little more.
The process of making Codex more sensible and better organized is
working out quite well. There's been a recent slowdown, which we have
to sort out.

No, ideally the User: pages should be moved in with minimal latency

Thanks all for your kind words.  I should clarify that I never intended 
to "retire" completely, just to pause until things settle in.

Wow - This really wasn't intended as a call to arms, but thanks :)

To be cynical, though, would this kind of response happen for a newer 
contributor (whose articles are likely just as good or better and more 
complete than any of my Template articles, as an example)?  Again, no 
personal attacks intended or implied.  I'm just offering up some 
discussion.

Actually, on the whole I think the docs are fantastic.  I can't tell 
you the number of times I've looked up Template Tag articles (Thanks 
Kaf) etc.  But the slowness you mention is, I suppose, really the main 
issue.  To take you, Carthik, as an example:  this personal 
preoccupation of yours is understandable (I can greatly sympathize - 
these past weeks, for example, I've been preparing my first talk for 
Group Meeting (it went pretty well)).  Having to do other things is 
always understandable; Codex is not my highest priority in life, and I 
don't think it should be for anyone.  But that's just it, people will 
always be preoccupied; I don't see things getting faster in the future. 
   Perhaps I'm wrong; it could be that things are slower now simply 
because Codex is still pretty new, but I don't think so.

The only obvious solution to me is to get an additional admin or two to 
help with the workload (actually, I guess I'm offering an idea rather 
than a solution.  As I mentioned before, I am not a candidate for such 
a role).

> Can you please help with creating task-oriented documentation that 
> derives from your Admin Panel pages?
I'll see what kind of time I have.

Thanks everyone for your input.  More importantly, thanks to everyone 
for all the great work they've done/do on Codex.  It's really a great 
resource.

A quick note to Podz and Lorelle.

Thanks for the encouragement.  It's particularly nice to hear from such 
dedicated WordPress docers such as yourselves.

Thanks both for all your work.

I moved in MDAWaffe's pages related to templates, as referenced in the
first mail in this thread.

Of particular note: I created http://codex.wordpress.org/Templates
which will be the launchpad for all sorts of template-related codex
information. It is the equal of [[Pages]] and [[Template Tags]], and
it's purpose in life is to act as a page summarizing all the available
"template" related information in the Codex.
The page needs editing, and it would be great if it "talked to" the
visitors more, in sentences, and made the template stuff make more
sense. A paragraph or two explaning what templates are etc, with links
in the running text will be cool.

Thanks to MDAWaffe for all this work! Thank you for your patience too. 

to-do:
MDAWaffe : can you please check if everything is satisfactory after
the move? i will appreciate it if you could check the "what links
here" for the old user: subpages and check to see that all links point
to the newly moved in pages. Once that is done, let me know and we can
delete the old user: subpages which are now redirects.

Thanks again!

Carthik.

Lorelle, 

Please move them into Codex when you think they are ready, although
they seem pretty good to me as is. As a suggestion, I would say that
you can move them in, and roll-in suggestions from the Forums, if
there are any that are good, later.

Each tutorial or list of resources can fit into one of the suitable
sub-sections from the Main page.

Carthik.

Let me chime in here.

The User:New page thing isn't working. So let's not use it any more. Move those 
pages into circulation.

I totally trust you, Michael, Kaf, Lorelle, MacManX and others in that you know 
the guidelines and do everything you can to follow them. Not only that, but you 
people have done some damn fine work.

I will change the "reminder" stub about creating new pages. Do we have a 
Category:New Page thing done yet? I'll check. If not, I will create it and put 
that information into the guidelines along with the "policy" change.

The original idea I believe gave us a bit of breathing space to get Codex into a 
better framework. Now we have it in place, it's time to evolve into the next 
phase and grow.

I can't speak highly enough of you people. You have helped make Codex into 
something to be proud of.

Let's keep up the good work, and, most importantly, the good communication.

Craig.

[[Getting_Started_with_WordPress]] is supposed to be that page you are
referring to here! It should have a brief writeup on how to get
started with wordpress, in addition to all the links and info
currently on the page.

I think of it this way, a user who is a first time Codex visitor sees
"Getting_Started" on the main page, wants to get started, and clicks
through to the Getting_Started_with_WordPress page. That is where the
brief info about how to get started with WP should be.

The next thing to do would be to delete the
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Files page. It serves no useful
purpose any longer.

I would be grateful if you or someone else, could check 
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&target=Template_Files

and update all incoming links to point to other pages, including the
recently created ones.

I'm taking a short break, and will fix this myself later, if everyone
else is busy right now, as well.

Carthik.

Craig,

Are we sure yet?

I am okay, eitherway. In any case, maybe we should finalize guidelines
for deciding new page names.

Please be considerate in choosing new names.

One of use should write up a more detailed guide for Codex vols,
including how they can mark "new pages" "copyedit", "rfd" and others.
I can see the need for one page with a list of how best to help
maintain Codex.

With marking up, and maintanence work from teh admins/whoever else, we
should be able to keep things in shape.

Carthik.

Will this be fixed, or is it to be removed from the main page?

As I'm working through the various template tags, I often wish I had a link to go back to the main Template Tags page, because I'm often working on more than one tag at the time.

Can we start adding some kind of link in the top of the page, maybe in the description paragraph that links back like:

                   The X [[template tag]] does Y.

Sure, go ahead. There is a link back to the template tag index on the
bottom of each template tag page - you might want to use that instead,
too.

I see some of this on Codex Guidelines, but it doesn't address
everything from your list above.  Where would one go and learn more,
any suggestions?  (Oh yeah, and if it is sweet and short, the
better... :-)

Is there any "official" guidance for translation?  I see at least some
Spanish translations, although the "index" page seems to have charset
trouble (at least on my browser)...

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:EduardoE

I'd like to try to translate pages to Finnish, at least the ones
linked to from the WordPress code as help.  It'll probably take me
forever, but gotta start somewhere...

Regards,
+ Kim

This is the next thing I will be doing at the Codex. I will try to
make it as short and sweet as possible.

There is no official guide to translate the documents. 
Do we really need one?
The mess on the Espanol pages was introduced since the recent 'reboot'
of Codex after it crashed once recently. I suspect that it is a result
of char-encoding clashes between the db and the pages. Matt should be
better placed to respond to this ;)

Great! Why don't you give it a shot, sounds like a great idea. You are
your own best judge, so trust your instincts and go for it :)

I'm such a little housekeeper lately.

I've found http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Wantedpages and there are a lot of pages on this list that exist. The problem is that it takes you to an edit page rather than the page itself. There are a ton of stuff on here.  These are functioning pages.  AH, I bet it's that capitalization thing that I've been fighting.  This is what I get when I mess with the caps.

I checked and a lot of these are from user serendipity who I remember was doing a lot of work on the Main Page but the links have probably all changed or she didn't have them exactly right during the work process. But there are others like tons of ??? that come from plugins.

If you are looking for a list of wanted articles, is there a place?  I posted a list of things, per request, that I thought would be good to bring over from the old Wiki at http://codex.wordpress.org/Talk:Wiki_Day and this might be good to clean up and list in a serious "Articles Wanted" page.

I fixed this, insofar as I created a link to the All Pages page and commented 
out the other. I also fixed up the {{Translationbar}} template as well.

Lorelle, the Wanted Pages just references running-text-links that
require to point somewhere. The entries there need to be corrected on
the page the (requesting) links are on, by instead pointing to pages
that exist that can be replacements for the intended links.

If that sounds too complicated, it's my fault entirely - I guess what
i am trying to say is that a lot of them are just typos, or links that
can be fixed by pointing them to the right page.

Carthik.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam ?  It seems like 
people going to Spam Words (from the link in Options/Discussions) may 
be looking for other anti-spam techniques as well.  And, since editing 
has been disabled on Spam Words, I though I'd ask here first.

Done! The page is protected since it is linked-to from wp-admin pages
on all 1.5 blogs.

Thanks,

I figured out, like I said, they were typos, and most of them are from User 
pages.  But there are some strange ones.  I'll try to help track them down.

Message-ID: <422C6792.2000500@skippy.net>

I deployed my new theme this weekend (thanks again, geeksmakemehot!), 
and to get it like I wanted it I had to go well beyond the default 
Template Tags.  I thought others might be interested in what I'd done, 
so I've posted my entire sidebar.php here:
    http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Skippy/Advanced

If there are default functions to do what I've done, I couldn't find them.

I'm sending this to docs, rather than hackers, because I think most 
folks on the hackers list could replicate this on their own; but the 
folks who need to read the Codex to make WP work the way they want it to 
work might find my example helpful.

Is there any place inside the Codex that I could/should flesh this out 
in a more howto manner?

I think this is an excellent example of the use of the is_* functions.
We have a new page [[Conditional Tags]], and this could be an example
at that page, with some minor mods.

I beleive there are plugins that show a count of the number of
comments,posts etc. and I think it should be possible to list the
categories the post belongs to in the sidebar for single-entry pages,
but your example is really neat, and we can point to a live website
that serves to show how the is_* functions work, if nothing else.

The other functions can go to the respective Template Tag pages, as
example of modifications. Like "If you want to do something similar to
this tag, but outside the loop, do this: "

Could you write up an example at the [[Conditional Tags]] page?

Carthik.

But before I do, is there official terminology for those things?  
You'll recall I was toying with "Administration Panels" instead of

I would use "Administration Pages" to talk about the page content (that 
which is created by the function sink) and "Administration Menus" to 
talk about the menus that link to those pages.  [[Adding Administration 
Menus]] is probably the best combination of least wordy and most 
accurate label for the page.

As a user, I'm liking the idea of the word "Panel" for the various screens, interchangable with "screen".  Admin Panel, Admin Screen, Write Post panel, Write Post screen - that sounds good.  Menus are the things you click on top bar line at the top.  So an instruction might be:

     From the Manage panel, click on the Categories tab from the menu.

I'd like to see the references to these things stay consistent, if I have any say. The pages Pages thing makes me nuts.  So if you create a new "menu" on an Admin panel, then it should be a toolbar menu looking thing.  If you are talking about a "section" on the Admin panel screen....see, it just works better.

Is this what you are asking?

Excellent clarification (differentiation).  Thank you.  A menu is a 
menu is a menu.


A page, on the other hand...

I too am looking for consistency.  Perhaps I've done more harm than 
good by favoring "Administration Panels" over "Administration Pages", 
but I wanted to avoid the use of the word "page"; I hoped to avoid 
collision with WordPress' new Page feature.  Perhaps this is 
unecessary.

I suppose this Page/Panel nomenclature business is off topic.  A new 
thread is in order if/when we need to face the issue.

I have started [[User:Carthik/Plugin_into_Plugins]] with the objective
of explaining how to write a plugin, covering all bases.

Maybe it needs to be split into many files, but that's a skeleton you
can start with.

I think that the API should remain just that - an API, and not
degenerate into a tutorial+cookbook+everything-else.

That page says "Please don't edit".  Should I not edit it to contribute? 
  Should I create my own page with suggestions for inclusion on that page?

I added a handful of trite examples to the Plugin API list, to give 
working examples of how they can be used.  Should these be removed?

I assume this will be geared to a medium to high skill level? I would like to 
see at least a small blurb on what "hooks" are, and what the hell an API is. :)

It may help pique interest in some people, and offer something up for those who 
hear the terms around the neighbourhood and are just mildly curious.

Examples are probably appropriate, but I think it would be best to give 
them their own section.  We really only need a few examples, too: an 
action, a filter, something that takes one or two parameters (see 
below).  I suggest we keep the example section _as short as possible_ 
and encourage people to ask on the list or the discussion page before 
adding new ones.  I see this article mostly as a quick reference for 
people, not a tutorial.  (Let me know if I'm being too fascist.)

Speaking of keeping things clean, I'd like to eventually get rid of the 
following sections from [[Plugin API]]:
#General Guidelines for Plugin Authors
#Adding Submenus to the Admin Menu
#Plugin Metadata

and put them on whatever top level Plugin Development article 
([[Writing Plugins]], [[Plug in into Plugins]]...).

And another thing.  If anyone's been following 
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=901
and can tell whether or not this new multiple parameter capability is 
stable enough to include yet, can you make sure the information gets in 
to [[Plugin API]]?

I've thought about this a bit over the past few days and really agree  
with Morgan.  In particular, it will be difficult to convince me that  
[[USER:MDAWaffe/Administration Panels]] etc. are not useful in their  
current form.

It may be possible to argue that Task Based docs are overall more  
useful, but it seems to me Tour (as Morgan aptly puts it) docs are  
necessary as well.  Documentation needs to come from both sides:

Alice asks "Can I make a particular Link not appear on my Links list?"   
TASK BASED

Bob points at his screen and asks "Links -> Add Link / Advanced:  
Visible radio button.  What does that mean and what does it let me do?"  
  TOUR BASED.

It's really the same question asked from two different ends.  Both get  
asked, and both need to be addressed.  But knowing one question does  
not mean you know how to ask the other.  Including documentation like  
[[Administration Panels]] is therefore necessary.  Where it should _go_  
and under what title (even ignoring the Panel nomenclature issue) are  
important questions, though.  Especially since it'd be nice not to  
duplicate information much (redundant and twice as hard to update).

Perhaps [[A Tour Through WordPress Administration|Administration  
Panels]] would be an appropriate link from [[Administering your blog]].

Please comment, critique, lambast or whatever else.

It should be a referecne, but I doubt "quick" is the word, if only 
because there are dozens of hooks to document.

For many hooks it would be helpful to see the format of data that's 
passed to and from the hook, so each should have an example.  For many, 
like the template tag filters, a "See the X hook for an example" would 
suffice.

More importantly, the action hook locations need to be explained 
thoroughly.  Skippy and I had a discussion on IRC the other day that 
could have been avoided entirely if this was documented properly.  
(Specifically, where edit_form_advanced is inserted.)

The content of [[Hacking WordPress]] needs to retitle to [[Writing 
Hacks]].  [[Writing Hacks]] needs to include information on writing 
actual hacks (it currently does) and stuff like the cache plugin 
constant.  A new page [[Writing Plugins]] would contain basic howtos (a 
couple of sections of Carthik's page, but not the whole thing) and links 
to the big sections that don't belong in [[Plugin API]].  [[Hacking 
WordPress]] then becomes an introduction into the methods of altering 
the WordPress code to suit your needs, and a lead-in to the [[Writing 
Hacks]] and [[Writing Plugins]] pages.

We need a big developer function reference, too.  Not just for 
formatting output, either.  There are a lot of useful functions in 
WordPress that could obviate reinventing the wheel.

All of these pages need to fall under a new umbrella from the home page, 
[[Developer Documentation]].  Expect that the rules would be slightly 
different here from the rest of Codex as you delve deeper into it, since 
you're not going to be talking to the average user.  Hopefully, they'll 
realize they're lost and go back to the easily found [[Plugins]], which 
isn't linked on the API page currently, and should be.

That issue is insane.  This needs coverage badly.  It seems to me that 
as far as the API reference is concerned this should be stable.

Sounds very reasonable.  I guess I didn't see just how involved the API 
documentation is going to need to be as the API itself keeps getting 
more involved.

Excellent suggestion.  I like the hierarchy.

I've been dreaming about this for a long time now.  Database interface, 
query structures, other classes... I'm sure you can think of more stuff 
than I.

[[Hacking WordPress]] should still be usable by casual users, even if 
what it links to gets too technical for most.  Otherwise, I agree.

No, removing it serves no purpose. I suggest we can move it later to a
more general how to write a plugin page.

Thing is, query_posts and wp_loginout are not full-blooded template
tags. We're still trying to figure out what to do with functions that
are not quite template tags, I beleive.

We have to figure something out soon, and get more hands at the ranch
to help with the horses. :)

I spent a good part of the last hour looking for a set of guidelines
for developing documentation for web-based application UIs. I got
nothing!

The gnome project comes close in defining standards in a document that
describes how to refer to various elements.

Usually, the good thing about standards is that there are so many to
choose from - but not in our case. So what do you say to we develop a
standard vocabulary to refer to various elements in the WordPress UI,
and nail them down in the Glossary, or in the codex_guidelines and
stick to it, from now on?

Michael, I wrote up 90% of the doc required for 1.2's UI, till the
complexity and the inanity got me. Repeating obvious things, and
things that are already in text on the UI helps no one, so the
challenge would be to answer the "why"s and "why not"s, rather than
just the "what"s of various things - if you are creating UI based
documentation. That is one reason I haven't really spent time reading
the pages you wrote up, cause they can suck up a whole lot of time,
and still be of little use to people - no one will want to know what
some button is, a few will want to know why it is there, or why it's
required, and not something else. A lot of people arrive at the Codex
with a specific "how to" in mind. We should suck them in, and give
them more info than what they came looking for - and hence, task-based
docs that reference the UI docs will be cool to have.

Point of this mail - decide nomenclature for different elements before
proceeding, to preserve order.

As for your page's name, I am glad to see the newly created page!

Is something like

Perhaps the problem (if there is one), then, is best solved with better 
innate documentation in WordPress itself.  Title attributes that 
specify what something is when hovered over?  A 'Help' Admin Panel?

If someone wants to implement tooltips for everything in WP's interface, 
I'll gladly spec them. Ideally the interface itself *should* make all 
"what does button X do?" documents redundant, leaving behind only the 
"how do I do Y?" documents.

Matthew,

Dude, can you think up a uniform nomenclature for us non-UI designers
to follow. Ideally it should define the name for each of the elements,
so no one will ask "Is this a page, or a panel, or a screen, or what?"


The tooltips idea is way too cool, too. All we need is a pair of free hands.

Carthik.

	Codex
Message-ID: <001f01c524ce$dd994700$6401a8c0@silver>

I have been battling for several days to validate my site - yes, finally to THAT stage - and I kept getting PHPSession errors.  I posted a note on the forums and it took ages to get an answer and I finally did - or at least I think I did.  It is explained at http://blog.crispen.org/archives/2005/03/09/wordpress-validation-error-work-around/ and the discussion is at http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=26631. 

Anyway, until there is a way to get this fixed, I think someone should look into it and maybe we should make a note of it on the Plugins page in the Codex and any articles about writing plugins.

I'm not one to jump on a bug and make a case out of it, but we're harping a lot in the Codex and discussions about the contests and themes about validating validating validating, and this error screws that up.  I don't know if this was known and around during 1.2 or the beta testing - I searched everywhere before posting - but I'd like to head off the wrath of the validating masses to either a reference in the codex or...I don't know.  How should this be handled?

Well, this isn't really an issue of WordPress or plugins, it's a problem 
with PHP's session management not respecting XHTML rules.  This is not 
to say that documenting it is a bad idea.

I can't think of a good reason for WordPress plugins to use PHP 
sessions, really.  Session management is good for things like logins, 
but WordPress manages that without using PHP sessions.

Beyond plugins, wouldn't enabling global sessions in PHP cause a search 
form to fail XHTML validation?  Reason suggests that it may not only be 
a problem within plugins, and is something that should be probably be 
documented in a generic "Why does my site fail XHTML validation?" FAQ.

Might also be nice to reset their password, so they can't log in after

These hit and run document additions are exactly the sort the {{Stub}} 
tag are designed to be used on, no matter where we end up putting them 
(I've added it to the pages listed). At the very least, it makes them 
easy to keep track of:

query_post() is a monster. Ryan writes from time to time about some of
the uses (multiple loops on a page etc)... I have one such saved here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Carthik/From_Mailing_Lists

Given the number of query vars it has, it could be a complicated page
- so how best do we tackle this?

I agree.
We can't define who uses WP, and we can't define how they use it, so I 
don't see how we should try too hard to define how they should seek out 
help.
If we have 2 or 3 people on the team who are both willing and able to 
contribute their time and energy, then I think we need to embrace what 
they bring and forget about any minor issues of repetition.
I think the repetition will occur because of the style of answer needed 
for the different information seekers - but it's not like Codex is space 
limited is it ? I'm not saying we need different ways of addressing 
things like Template Tags where a learning curve is to be expected, but 
for the UI, I really don't see why more cannot mean better.

Yes, it's a problem with PHP sessions and XHTML 1.1's requirement that 
form elements be inside a block level tag. I don't know of a workaround, 
on one site I did I just hid the form.

I agree, tooltips is awesome.  That's the first thing I look for when 
installing a new program.

But I have a question on the nomenclature issue.  Is this for documentation 
for editors and writers or for the general WP user? If the latter, what 
would be the difference between the glossary and another page for 
nomenclature?

If the former - it's about time.  I want to declare that I lead the pack in 
those who think the Page/page thing was an amazingly idiotic thing to come 
up with.  Somewhere along the line someone should have thought "Hey, do you 
think this is a little confusing?"  Anything that clears up the names of the 
pieces and parts is brilliant and desperately needed as WordPress expands 
across the planet.  Especially because of that.  The International Scene for 
WordPress is booming, from what I read, and it works best when you have one 
set of words to translate from.

I'll sort one out and post it to a user page.
I'll say now though that making access to svn files will have the idiots

I just want to understand this issue with PHP sessions.  Are plugins (in
general, not specfically) supposed to NOT use sessions?  (This is from
someone who is totally illiterate about PHP other than what it takes to make
my site go and do pretty things.) If they are NOT or "shouldn't" because of
this known error, then YES we need to put some reference in the "how to make
your own plugin" pages to help future authors.  If we can narrow down which
plugins trigger this bug, then it would be "nice" to let them know about it,
if they don't, so they might find a work around or something.

Does this error cause harm to the site or content?  It is just annoying to
me, but what do I know?

For users who are determined to get that "Validates" button to wear proudly,
we need to put something in the plainest of terms about this in the Codex.
Troubleshooting would be a good start, FAQ is a must, but it needs to be
listed as a known issue. I'd title it "Why does my site fail validation?" 
rather than the XHTML validation - just to keep it simple simple.

In the article  at
http://blog.crispen.org/archives/2005/03/09/wordpress-validation-error-work-around/
he has a work around, but he calls it dangerous.  I wouldn't know dangerous
workaround if it bit me in a private part.  Is it?  Is this a possible fix? 
He has the article out there now, and it's mentioned on the forums, so it 
will turn up in searches. He is willing to set the record straight for 
whatever that means so the "fix" is out there.  Will that fix hurt WordPress 
installs?

I wouldn't have brought this up here, but it is something that seems like it
would affect most WordPress users - IF they go for the validation test. And 
we're training them to look for the answers in the Codex.

The ideal audience for this is theme authors who want their themes in 
the repository but don't know the first thing about version control or 
subversion.

Should there be a warning about it in the Plugin pages?  Sure, but I 
wouldn't make a huge issue of it.  As I said, there isn't much cause to 
use sessions in WordPress plugins anyway.  Add a note to the Writing 
Plugins page about it, add some info in a related FAQ about it, move on.

!!!Using PHP Sessions
Please avoid using PHP session statements in your plugins (like 
<code>session_start()</code>) because the output that PHP produces for 
browsers that don't support cookies will break XHTML validation on a 
WordPress site with the plugin activated.

> Does this error cause harm to the site or content?  It is just annoying to
> me, but what do I know?

It can cause your site not to validate.  If we're predicating getting 
theme/CSS assistance in the forums on whether the site's code validates, 
then this would be an issue.  Otherwise, not much damage is usually 
caused by breaking XHTML a little here and there.  Usually this 
particular issue doesn't break layouts visually, and isn't even detected 
until you try to validate the page.

If a user discovers that one of their plugins causes their site to 
produce invalid XHTML/HTML output, they should disable that plugin and 
email the plugin author about the issue or if the plugin is in the 
repository, submit a ticket in the wp-plugins.org issue tracker.  This 
advice would be the same for any plugin that breaks a site.

Well, the first "workaround" is to disable the offending plugins, which 
is just what I suggested.  This has an obvious downside, but only the 
site operator can determine which is more important, validation or that 
plugin's operation.

The second workaround seems reasonably safe, but it'll most likely have 
an odd effect on plugins that rely on sessions and process hits from 
browsers that don't accept cookies.  He says he only knows of one such 
plugin, and he found a replacement for it.

Short answer: No, not dangerous, but the plugin that uses it probably 
won't work as expected if you apply this "fix".  Better to find a 
different plugin that does the same thing or petition the author not to 
use sessions.

We've now both written tons more on this issue than what Codex will need 
to contain.  :)

That's what I'm wondering. Why not just place WP terms in the Glossary, 
and mark them as WordPress-specific? Multiple locations for definitions 
could start to get annoying...I mean confusing.

Heh.

Can't deny that's a good idea, but if there was at least a modicum of 
pre-existing stuff on it (even raw), I don't think I'd have a problem 
working out how to document it.

Look through WP_Query::get_posts() in classes.php and make a list of
everything in $q[].  Those are the query vars.  Then we need to note the
type, allowed values, and default value for each query var.  Here's a
quick start.

Name: posts_per_page
Description: The number of posts to display per page.
Type: integer
Allowed values:  -1 and greater (-1 turns off paging, displaying all
posts).
Default: posts_per_page db option

Name: name
Description:  A sanitized post title
Type: string
Allowed values: Any post name in the db
Default: none

Name: p
Description: A post ID
Type: integer
Allowed values: Any post ID in the DB
Default: none
...

How about we get a list of all the query vars started in Codex and then
begin filling in the details for each.  The collected data can then be
used to generate something more readable.

Subject: [wp-docs] new codex page for developers/dev discussion?
Message-ID: <422FB180.9040906@gmail.com>

I just finished reading through the archives on the New Pages 
discussion; sorry I didn't get to it sooner, didn't realize how deep and 
sensitive the issue could be.

I wish to have a page on the codex talking about the current state of 
WordPress database support, particularly the interest of including 
Postgres and other databases in future releases.  This is following the 
suggestion of developer Matt way back in 2004 on a WordPress support 
thread about the topic.[1]

In the interests of keeping my newly created page, "Database 
Support"[2], from remaining bastardly, where might be a good place to 
provide the link-to?  All the sections of the codex seem centered on 
end-user support, and not on developer discussion.  Should there be a 
"Developer" section on the Main Page?  Might be a good place to include 
the wildly popular topics of feature requests &c.

Does anyone object to the page name "Database Support" for this topic? 
I can see the verb "support" being ambiguous in this case; someone might 
go to the page looking for help on getting their database set up, when I 
mean that which WordPress supports.  Any better suggestions?

I think a new heading in the top Advanced Topics page covering dev 
issues like this would be a good start.

Some may see "Database Support" as misleading. How about "Employing 
Alternative Databases"?

"Beyond MySQL" may be a little too kitschy.

I am terribly sorry I did not read this thread before I renamed the page.

I have renamed it to [[Using Alternate Databases]]. I think me and Kaf
agree here to some extent. I was trying to summarize the spirit of
that page in renaming it thus.

Regarding a section for Developers, I think it is quite apt - we could
provide details about how to submit diffs (though svn makes it
ridiculously simple), how to file bug reports, about wp-testers,
function references and documentation, l10n docs etc. So what do you
say, folks, shall we start a new Codex "section" for developers of all
kinds?

Carthik.

There are a lot of links to references on fonts, validation and optimization

Lorelle,

You are a maintenance nightmare - a few more prolific users like you
to churn out articles at this rate, and I throw in my towel! ;)

Alright, so now that the Codex is "open" to new pages, take a shot at
page titles for your new pages and move them in, one by one. Use your
judgement - as for this page, why designing for contests. The one
contest that is around will soon be gone, so maybe you can roll it
into plain old "designing themes" or something?

I would rather have an external links section on relevant existing
pages, than have a page dedicated to external links, unless it comes
with useful commentary.

Carthik.

Missing pages provide a list of what's needed.  This page or something 
like it should replace the [[Hacking WordPress]] link on the Codex Home 
Page.

Well, I think we need a little more than some documentation about this 
thing.  After four days of poking at this, I went back to the basics and 
found that the criminal kicking off the PHP session errors was NOT the 
plugins at all, but a single link to a category on my site:

<a title="Thoughts on Life" href="index.php?cat=7">Journal Thoughts</a>

I'm waiting for help on the forums to clarify what's wrong with the link to 
trigger the PHP session errors, but it just goes to prove that the little 
things will make you crazy, and if it got me, then it will get others and we 
need to document this in a way that people can find the information.

I'd like to see a Troubleshooting section that deals with validation errors 
beyond just "Why doesn't my XHTML page validate".  Very simple to help 
people target if it is WordPress, HTML, PHP, or CSS that is the problem.  It 
might be beyond the scope of the Codex, but something that will help problem 
solve these things in the future.

I am debating about an article about Validation in general, culled from the 
article on Contests 
(http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Designing_Themes_for_Contests), so 
that might be a good place to add a little troubleshooting help.  I do have 
an article in my user area on Troubleshooting CSS problems 
(http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/CSS_Troubleshooting) as well as CSS 
Browser Bugs 
(http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/CSS_Fixing_Bugs_and_Hacks), so 
another on Validation and Troubleshooting Validation would be easy...unless 
someone is working on it already.

Designing for Distribution?

I agree with Carthik...Designing for Contests is too specific, and besides, the 
information is great when thinking about design in general.

Lorelle, could you please bottle some of your energy and send it to me? Please? ;)

That's already a much better name, I agree.  Not to be semantically 
nit-picky, but I think "Alternate" should, as an adjective, probably be 
"Alternative"...  and is the "Using" necessary?  What about just 
[[Alternative Databases]]?

> Regarding a section for Developers...

Seems to me there is a slight difference between the impressive work on 
[[User:ringmaster/Developer_Documentation]] and what I was shooting for 
with the database page.  Ringmaster's is documenting what is there now, 
whereas I was going for a section for discussion and woodshopping of 
future development ideas, and roadmapping for features and such.  I'm 
sure this is stuff that the development team already does, but doesn't 
publicize; it would be neat to get the community in on it.

(On a side note, perhaps another future development idea would be 
implementing PHPDoc commenting throughout the WordPress source code, to 
make function reference documentation automatic.)

I'm pretty bad at names.... how does a section heading on [[Advanced 
Topics]] such as "=== Future Development ===" sound?  In the interests 
of not making [[Alternative Databases]] (or whatever it ends up being 
called) lonely under that heading, does anyone else have any game-ready 
pages that would fit this section?  Is it too dangerous to actually put 
a page up called [[Feature Requests]]?  I suppose that can of worms 
might open itself eventually anyway...

"Alternate" does imply that you're going to alternate between two 
databases periodically, so yes, that's not quite the right word as far 
as usage goes.  "Using", though, is necessary because it tells the 
reader what's going to happen to the alternative database, as opposed to 
deleting, installing, coding, or eating it.

Hmm, the documentation for submitting issues and feature requests to

Instead of "Using" we could use a form of "Implement". i.e. "Alternative
Database Implementation".

"Alternate" is an adjective that means "That which is an alternative".
You can feel free to look it up. I did, before I created the title,
and Owen, it's not a verb - no one is talking about alternating
between databases anymore that one's referring to going to the post
office when one submit a new "post".

We prefer action or task oriented titles. I used to think the way you
do, but flipped after a long discussion on the mailing list, IRC and
the codex.

No, the development team is not a coterie of any kind. All discussions
except some maybe security issues or sensitive issues are discussed at
the wp-hackers list. A lot of the developers haven't been too active
lately, and the way things are, everything moves ahead just fine. User
can provide feedback at wp-hackers and things are rolled in, or,
sometimes, out. If you want to volunteer for that task of updating the
codex with news from wp-hackers, please feel free.

Good idea, and this has been thought of before - just have to decide
to go one or the other, now. phpxref is useful too.

Go ahead and create whatever you think is most appropriate, and it
will change if it needs to. Feature requests are at the bugtracker
right now. Putting that up at the Codex would not serve the purpose,
since devs may not always keep that in mind.

No worries.  :)

It's simpler and understandable enough to keep it as-is, which is 
something I should have been more clear about originally.

I changed the title of the page. It is better to make changes sooner
rather than later, and just so that this does not just stay in my mind
forever:

I had a AIM chat with Matt, and we agreed that it is okay to rename
pages early in their life and that the redirects will be left in,
until it seems sure that the old page is not linked-to from pages in
the codex, or outside the codex. After a few days, the redirects can
be removed if no external pages link to the original title. This way -
everyone can create and contribute, and we use technology to
circumvent problems ;)

I'm assuming we don't want people's names on articles, unless it's a 
fairly substantial credit:

"...lead developers Ryan Boren and Matt Mullenweg..."
"... see Podz' excellent tutorial..."
crediting plugin/theme authors

That sort of thing seems fine.

A "for more information" link to external discussion (either on the 
forums or their site or ...) is more appropriate for smaller notes.  
Anyone Disagree?

Do we have some rubric to decide when to credit individuals/when not to?

PS:  I know, [[The Loop#Advanced Use]].  It's a stopgap until it can be 
fixed up better (or is that "substantial" enough to be credited?)

There has been no formal statement of when to name names on the Codex,
so it's pretty much depending upon the page author's wish. I
personally do not like to see people names on pages saying "This page
was created by XYZ" for obvious reasons.

Links to external sites could have the names in them, which, in my
opinion is better than a generic "see for more..." link text, since
there is some differentiation between links and some additional
information as to who wrote the page (more semantic and all that jazz)

Alternate: 1.) occurring by turns; succeeding each other; one and then 
the other 2.) every other; every second 3. being one of two or more 
choices; alternative

This is from Webster's New World College Dictionary Fourth Edition. 
"Alternate" can indeed be used for "alternative," but it is not the best 
choice for that purpose.

I would voice my opinion that 99.99% of the time there should not be any names 
on the Codex for attribution purposes of any kind. Information on the history of 
WordPress and perhaps the significant contributions of others would be 
appropriate in context.

Any objection to moving [[User:ringmaster/Developer Documentation]] in

[[Writing Plugins]] seems more in line with the naming convention.  My 
fault - I brought it up as Writing a Plugin (from the reference in 
[[Plugin API]]).

Can we rename it now before it's too late?

Glad to help.  This is certainly an inspiration for me to continue doing so.

I'll help clean up/provide some pages in this area as I get the 
opportunity.  My son's christening is this weekend, so look toward 
Monday, or earlier if the in-laws tick me off.  ;)

James,
Nice work.  The redundancy is good (and gave me a chuckle).  The only 
thing I would worry about is the intimidation factor.  I image it would 
be better for a few non-bugs to get through than to miss any real bugs. 
  Should the article be given an encouraging introduction?

Thanks again, and I'd love it if you had some more developer content in 
you for Codex.  Congrats on your son and good luck with the in-laws!

Actually, user "Dillyputty" is more of a vandal than a spammer.... and 
he's busy.  Any help from an admin with ban privileges would be nice.

I grepped the source and found not dozens, but:
129 unique filters
45 unique actions
as of 3/12/2005 SVN revision 2434
(I can send a list if you want to compare)

I assume some triage will be done in documenting hooks.  Suggestions?

Thanks, Craig, for the template and category.  Good idea.

Carthik mentioned on another thread [1] that after renaming an article 
we should (naturally) update all internal links referencing the old 
page to reference the new page, and (more cleverly) watch the old URL 
for hits from outside before deleting the redirect.

Does this external hit watch just happen automatically, or is there 
someone (Matt?) or something we need inform after renaming a page?

I'm not about to go on a renaming rampage; I'm just curious.

I'm not sure what you're using, but I have a program (PowerGREP) that 
can collect these along with their passed parameters.  Many of the hooks 
in code are duplicates, but the variations of their use need to be 
documented.

You can forward what you've got, though, and I'll compare notes.  Or, 
maybe do like I did back before Skippy did some much needed rewrites and 
put the list on the page in a comment, in case someone else wants to 
take a whack before I can allocate a chunk of time.

That's a really good question. I have no idea. I guess the one page to watch is 
"Popular pages" for this. Not really sure though.

Rampage away, Michael. "Edit mercilessly" is the credo! :)

This brings up a point regarding length of time to ban someone. I assume that 
there is a setting somewhere in MediaWiki where the amount of time available to 
ban someone can be changed. I don't think that 24 hours is long enough for cases 
like this. Nice to see that he was autobanned via his IP address when he tried 
to vandalise under another user ID.

When you block a user it asks how long the ban should stay in place.  
Kaf got to him (I'm bigotedly guessing the gender) first and gave him 
48 hours,  I think.  Not knowing he was already banned, I gave him 72.  
Too bad it's not additive :)

The default is 24 hours.  You can change both the number and the units, 
but I don't know how big the number can be or what the allowed units 
are (days, minutes, millennia...?).

By the way, is there a way to purge individual revisions from the 
history of an article?  There's still a few 'dirty words' hanging about 
there (though not in any article's current revision thanks to James' 
valiant efforts).

I found Skippy's list (how did I miss it? It's right there on the 
discussion page) and it's the same as mine.  I've got sample parameters 
as well, but to document these things you'd have to grep each one 
individually and take a look anyway, so I don't know how useful they'd 
be.  And you've got them yourself, too.  But I'm happy to add them to 
Skippy's list if you want.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.

A kind soul wrote up a list of query parameters: [[User:Cameron/Query 
Variables]].  I'm sure he/she won't mind anyone fleshing it out for 
inclusion in the Developer Documentation.

The note Cameron makes at the top is a good one, though.  Is there 
anyplace where people can find how to specify an author's page 
(http://example.com/author/Cameron, for example), date pages, etc.?  I 
couldn't find anything on either [[Using Permalinks]] or 
[[Introduction_to_Blogging#Pretty_Permalinks]].

Where should that information go?  [[Using Permalinks]] with a ref from 
the FAQ?

Moving this from the 'Adding Administration Menus' thread to a new one.

See http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MDAWaffe/WordPress_Terminology

To answer Lorelle's question: it's not meant to be documentation at 
all.  This page is meant as a Sandbox for people to make suggestions 
regarding consistent nomenclature.

And Kaf's: the Glossary is the natural choice.  My point is that I 
don't believe there exists consistent WP specific terms yet.  That user 
page of mine can be scrapped after terms are decided.

Perhaps this is too anal though?  Should things be more 
freeform/organic?

I think that trying to pin down WP isms is a good idea. It will help in 
documentation, and it will help in the support forums. I can see developers of 
plugins and such benefiting from it as well.

Sweet! I think that this was borked in a prior version of MediaWiki, because 
both Podz and I tried to ban people for longer stretches of time and it just 
wouldn't work.

Anyway, I just tried 1 year on Dillyputty and it worked! :)

I'll send it to you off list.  It's really not a big deal (and not all 
that offensive - the pictures were worse), but I don't want to give him

I've more or less finished munging [[Plugin API]] and [[Writing a 
Plugin]] about.  The basic philosophy:
[[Plugin API]] is for hooks: actions and filters.
[[Writing a Plugin]] is for everything Plugin Development oriented and 
should be the new "papa-bear" of all plugin development articles.

As for Plugin User Documentation, I believe the [[Main Page]] should 
reference [[Plugins]] (to be the main user documentation article for 
plugins) instead of [[Managing Plugins]] which should be referenced 
from [[Plugins]], [[Working with WordPress]], the FAQs etc.

New comers will want to know what Plugins are first, not how to 
activate them, and old comers will want to cut to the chase and find 
the list of Plugins.  Currently, finding the list is confusing:
Click 'Plugins' on the Main Page
Click 'Plugins' on the page to which you were just sent ("... I thought 
I was already there" *checks* "nope... Managing Plugins, that's not 
what I clicked on...").

Thoughts on Dev and/or User plugin docs?

I said I'd do it....and I can't.
I have looked at the SVN program, read docs, stared at structures and I 
remain clueless. Given that any guide inevitably generates followup 
questions, I really don't feel that I can do this justice on any level.
I'll have to pass on this one  - sorry guys !

Hmmm...it may be that no matter what you set, it will only block someone for 24 
hours. I just blocked him for one year, and it shows up as such in the list of 
blocked users. Let's just see what happens after 24 hours.

I've started writing up some info on the wpdb database interface class 
for inclusion in [[WordPress Database Reference]].  I suppose it could 
go into [[WordPress Function Reference]] instead.

In either case, to any hacker types out there, is the information I've 
got so far useful, or should we just point people to the ezSQL docs and 
make a note of the few differences?

This is nice.  I think that we should provide documentation in our style 
for the ezSQL functions, at least those commonly used by the core code 
and defined under the $wpdb object.  Especially missing from what you've 
got are the table definitions.

This page would be well-placed in Developer Documentation -> WordPress 
Function Reference -> Class Reference -> wpdb, and should be referenced 
from anywhere in the dev docs that talks about databases, like on the 
page that describes the database structure itself, [[WordPress Database 
Reference]].  I had envisioned the [[WordPress Database Reference]] page 
as a definition of the database tables and fields and their purposes.

How I've described categorizing this is a little deep into the site.  
Maybe the [[WordPress Class Reference]] page should be linked to from 
[[Developer Documentation]] directly?

Anyway, that's just my mental organization on the topics.  Yours, if 
different, may make more sense.

I wasn't aware that "do something" was a requirement.

Wouldn't it be better to just deal with the vandals and spammers and

Subject: [wp-docs] Inserting page content multiple places
Message-ID: <4235CFB5.7000806@midnightcircus.com>

I was thinking that it would be nice to write some function reference on 
a central page, and then include those functions on other pages.

Here's the example that I'd like to try:

Write up add_options, update_options, get_option on their own "WordPress 
Options" page. (This is a *bad* page name for this, since it's developer 
reference and not end-user reference.  One idea on this is below.)
-THEN-
Include that page content into both [[Writing a Plugin]] and [[WordPress 
Funciton Reference]].

I think the Guidelines page does this with a subsection.  Maybe I should 
have checked that first for how to do it, but commentary on the idea 
seems like a good thing.

What do you think about sub-pages for sections of function reference 
like this?  It might be a convenient way to isolate dev docs from 
end-user docs.  Something like [[WordPress Function Reference/Options]]?

(Editing [[Writing a Plugin]] right now.)

The Codex is for all to see, there is nothing hidden. The only reason you
need an account would be if you plan on editing pages and contributing.
That's what Craig meant.If you never have and don't ever plan on editing a
page, why do you have an account. Is it cool to say "I have an account at
the wp codex!" :P (If that's the case, keep your account, and tell everybody
else they need one!)

I use a google search or two to find out what pages link to the page
in question. Searching for the URL of the page, as well as the title
of the page is useful.

A stats package or something to track hits would be nice, though.

Craig, so how do we rename the pages you marked as requiring renaming,
maybe you could rename them after a brief discussion on this list
about alternative names etc?

If the description is short enough then you can include the page (or
even a section) but there might be problems caused by redirects and
such later (renaming will be another problem, when you include pages
or sections thus). A link would be just as fine, in most cases, I
think.

I did that to fill that page up, since it is linked to from the
sidebar, and so I presumed a lot of folks should be clicking through,
and it was blank, so I included the other page there. That can go,
later.

Physical isolation (namespace or subpages) is not vital  -- it just
needs to be clear from the titles and the organization of pages/links
that those pages are developer documentation. The problem with
subpages for this might be that later, there might be questions about
what needs to be a subpage and what should be a page on it's own. If
there is a good, well-defined hierarchy, as with the template tags
currently, then I would think that it is a good idea.

A section of [[Using Permalinks]] sounds great, the problem with this
is that for the individual posts etc, the URL will change with the

That sounds perfect.

[[Writing Plugins]] does sound better to me, so Michael, you can
rename it if you like :) I am okay with it otherwise, too.

Skippy's list and your lists (Owen, and Michael) are good. I created
one such list a long time ago, which must be outdated now. about
triaging the work, what about we put in some basic stuff about the
hooks, like perhaps a sentence for each hook and then build on it
later.

Kaf does a great job with the Template_Tag pages, what we need is a
loving parent for the hooks :)

We ought to think about organizing hooks into section according to
their functions, too., about the same way Plugins are.

Micheal,

Be bold, and make changes as you see fit :) Like Skippy once said to
me a long time ago, you have to assume authority - no one will give it
to you (was that right, Skippy?)

So dude, go ahead with reasonable changes.

Carthik.

Hmm... Good Point.  It's just that the page looked slick and was also 
more informative with the relevant function reference right there as 
opposed to having to click a link to elsewhere.  But...

...then I guess I may try to conceive such a heirarchy, which I think 
may be possible.  Just a casual glance at what is available so far in 
Dev Docs indicates this:  Options Functions, Admin Panel Functions, 
Localization Functions.  There are also (or should be) functions for 
every template tag in the form of get_the_*().  The obvious first 
criteria would be that these subpages contain *only* function reference 
(declaration, parameters, return value, description) and not how-tos.

I think it's a good idea to give some logic to the function reference 
anyway, even if they aren't pushed to subpages, since listing them 
alphabetically doesn't seem too useful for finding what you need.

I'm not trying to exclude lurkers or anyone else, for that matter. You don't 
need an account to get any information from Codex. You don't need an account on 
Codex to be a member of this list.

I see nothing wrong with deleting accounts that aren't used. It's not a knock 
against anybody. It's simple database management and maintenance.

s/authority/power

"No one gives you power, you just take it."  Absolutely correct.

In the end, whatever's better is what'll stay, anyways, so let's keep
our minds open about this right now.

Yes, the get_the_*() and is_*() functions are already described at the
pages written up by MDAWaffe. The others need doing.

Aye, sir! Good organization/structure is essential, and if that's
there, and it's extensible, then yes, I have no objection to subpages.

P.S. I was offline for two days, after a long long time (or so it
seems) and now am on "leave" from school for a week. I will try to
talk less and work more now that I am done catching up with wp-doc
mails. I will also try to not be around too much :)

It might be just me, but I see everything wrong with this. What's the 
need for eliminating accounts? I see no benefit from a maintenance 
standpoint. Sure you don't need an account to just read, but what of 
the users who read a lot and decide to correct a typo just once -- only 
to find that their account has been deleted without warning?

It's a Very Bad Thing to mess with users' accounts, and doing so would 
only serve to pressure people into contributing to keep their account 
active. Which is very un-wiki-like and just plain unnecessary. User 
accounts should NEVER be messed with, except in cases of vandalism or 
spamming.

This has nothing to do with bragging rights Ryan, it's just a user 
account. There is no requirement to create an account; why should there 
be a requirement to keep it?

Uh, WTF?

What if someone were a lurker and had decided to get an account to make 
updates where s/he saw fit in the future?

Is the db being overloaded by user accounts on a software level? This is 
mediawiki, it can take quite a bit of hammering.

I tend to agree with Morgan and Firas, but would have been a bit 
more... diplomatic than Firas managed.

Deleting the Spammers and the Vandals is ok (though it certainly won't 
discourage them), but I think we should have as few barriers to 
contributing as possible.  If deleting a "lurker" or 
so-far-non-contributing account stops one person from fixing a typo, 
clarifying an ambiguous section, reverting spam/vandalism, or 
correcting bad information, then it shouldn't be done.

Plus, it might be tricky to make sure the database plays nice after 
deleting dead accounts.  Contributions, Histories and such might go a 
little wonky (but I don't know anything about the database structure or 
its interface).

Besides, having all those accounts in the database makes it all the 
easier to send out Codex spam to everyone who's ever even looked at the 
site.  That's the first step toward total world domination by Codex :-) 
   (Step 3: profit!)

With few exceptions, I believe we have been having a discussion.  I, 
certainly, am not out to 'shit on' anything.  Yours was a reasonable 
suggestion though, apparently, one with which several people (myself 
included) disagree.

My disagreement should not be taken as a personal affront, and, though 
I cannot speak for others, I would suggest not taking anybody else's 
disagreement as such either.  Having heard many excellent suggestions 
and having received much excellent guidance from you, your suggestions 
will continue to be carefully considered on my part, and I expect on 
the part of others as well.

Hi Craig,

I'm sorry about the tone of my message, my meaning was to join in the 
discussion too, although I did too hastily.

I just thinking that removing accounts that haven't contributed yet and 
aren't causing any damage is A Bad Idea, and that's all. I appreciate 
the time and effort you put into the WordPress community, including with 
issues such as these, and I don't think anyone would intend to 'rake you 
over the coals' for anything.

Regards,
Firas.

I was searching for something unrelated and turned up a link to

and low and behold I found a ton of free articles on ecommerce and all kinds

things?

I'm sure they don't belong in the Codex, and I'm sick as a dog and not

My 2 cents:

I don't think Craig is out to be the User Account dictator.  I also 
don't think he's out to shit on.  What I do think he's after is deleting 
user accounts that haven't been used in 6 months to a year.  Now, I 
don't think anyone can justify an account's existence if it has been 
inactive for 6 months to a year.  In fact, most free services do 
deactivate accounts that have been inactive for 6 months to a year.  
And, the Codex is a free service.  Is this necessary for database 
maintenance?  Yes.  Why?  Because it removes clutter.  Anything that 
removes clutter is necessary for database maintenance.  As a bonus 
point, Codex visitors who haven't used their user accounts in 6 months 
to a year will probably not notice the fact that their account is gone.

I'd hate to see my account deleted just because I didn't have time to
contribute.

I have some questions:

- How is inactivity measured?  Does one need to modify a page to be
considered active, or is it sufficient to just login to your account?

- If your account is deleted, what happens to the attribution for any
prior contributions made with the account to Codex?  If another person
registers the same account later, will he/she be credited as the
author of all the changes made with any prior accounts with the same
name?

- What happens to watch lists and user pages that were created?  Are
they just going to be deleted?  Are user pages seen as zero value
contributions?

- Is there a policy on the forum accounts or mosquito accounts?

I think it would be simplest to just keep all accounts.  Even if it
wasn't simplest, I think it would be best to keep all accounts unless
it is really causing a problem with the database.

Regards,
+ Kim

Craig,

No one's out to diss you :)
The number of accounts is really inconsequential. Heck, the WP forums
has so many members that have posted once, or maybe never. I heard
someone say that User Accounts are not to be messed with, and that is
true.
Imagine the problems when returning users can't find their accounts.
All Hell Will Break Loose and all that jazz.

Craig, I, for one, think it's great you threw the idea out for
discussion, which is all that's happening here.

Carthik.

For my part, I didn't mean to shit on you, Craig. It wasn't just your 
suggestion, it was Owen's and Ryan's too. So if I was dragging anyone 
across the coals, it was all three of you. ;-)

No offense intended to anyone involved -- it just strikes me as 
(really) bad practice. I know I'm not a sysadmin on Codex, but I've 
done my share of sysadmining in my time, and this idea just makes me 
cringe.

I've got a rough sketch of the wpdb class at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MDAWaffe/Functions .  I agree now that 
the content is better served from the [[WordPress Function Reference]] 
section.

Speaking of, I've made a draft of such a page: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Function_Reference .  The 
inspiration, as you can see, comes from [[Template Tags]].  I had 
envisioned a similar implementation:  links in each section to pages 
describing individual functions or groups of similar functions.  I am 
open to other implementations.

The sections delineated there were completely off the cuff.  Please 
organize things differently if you see a better alternative.  In 
particular, what do people think about each class (or natural group of 
classes) getting its own box on the page? Also, I don't really know 
what "basic functions" could be; functions from functions.php will 
probably go into several categories.  Again, edit at will.  Owen, you 
seem to have a good idea how things should be organized.  Do you mind 
poking the page or listing a sectional hierarchy here?

This brings up the subpage issue.  It seems the best way to implement 
to me, but I'm open.  I suppose, then, each of the functions I describe 
for the wpdb class should have its own page, with an umbrella page 
describing database interface in general, the class variables, and the 
class as a whole.

I don't want to do anything drastic, though, until I hear possibly 
better ideas.

Hey!  This time (for once) it wasn't me who was doing the shitting. 
Cull the herd or reproduce in prosperity, I don't really care.  I'll be 
active enough to keep my own account alive either way, and when I'm not, 
I won't care 'cause I'll be dead.

This page looks fairly complete.  My only thought (and don't take this 
as a negative, since I may still come around to this idea) is that I 
find the functional function references a bit unnerving.  (Functional 
function references = Titling a function by what it does rather than 
using its name.)

What I imagine might be optimal from an end-user/developer point of view 
is an actual "reference" with just the function definitions and 
parameters, and then a how-to for each section that links to the reference.

I'm rambling here because there's an alarm going off in my intuition. 
Is it a false alarm?

Using the core filenames seems like a logical way to break up the larger 
sections, but I wonder if there are subsection groupings that make 
sense.  Like in my last message on this topic, I was talking about 
Options functions.  This grouping isn't large enoguh (the three 
functions currently in [[Writing a Plugin]]) for it's own major heading, 
but where does it go?  In which of these sections would you look for it?

I require more thought on this yet.  Maybe I just need to break it out 
and do it to see what it looks like.

I think maybe that's what I was trying to say at the beginning - I would 
put the class reference on one page, and then have the description of 
the interface along with a few examples on another.  I don't know if I 
would put each function on its own page, though - that would seem to 
spawn a lot of clicking around.

For example, there could be a developer reference page, [[Accessing the 
Database]] that describes the interface and how to use it in general 
which has support function reference on [[wpdb Database Class]] (or 
whatever you want to call your current [[User:MDAWaffe/Functions]]). 
Perhaps the function reference could be embedded in the developer 
reference page, or maybe a simple link would suffice.

Similarly, I'd rip out the "#Saving Plugin Data to the Database" section 
from [[Writing a Plugin]], replace it with concrete examples that link 
to the ripped out stuff as a pure function reference.

I'm just looking at this from my perspective versus newbie devs.  For 
me, I want to skip the "How-to" page and just get the function 
parameters or whatever.  I don't want a lot of prosy stuff in the way of 
what I want to know, yet that stuff may be more important for others 
than the function reference itself.

Owen's suggestion of seperating function references from How-Tos seems
to be good. For now, maybe we can have both the name of the function
and the text that describes how it can be used as the section heading?

What we have started here is not an easy task to accomplish with
respect to organization, the best we can do is try out different
things and settle on what seems to be good, which should not be a
problem in itself.

I've been sick so I'm just catching up on this, but I saw the same HUGE list 
and thought, why can't these be cleaned out?  They certainly aren't much 
good if they've been sitting there for months and months.  Certainly not 
those that have been there for a couple of months but after six months with 
no activity, I'd get rid of them because I like a clean house.  I know the 
codex has been being hit with a lot of spam, and while it's supposed to be 
easy access, I was wondering if a second step couldn't be taken to make it 
less inviting to the vandal-prone.

I thought about it and then decided that it wasn't mine to fuss over.  I'm 
not the one in charge or the one with an opinion that really matters when it 
comes to administration.  Just a concerned citizen.  But I gave it some 
serious thought and was delighted to see your question, Craig.  Took the 
question out of my mouth.

I'm still concerned about attributions in page changes for removed as
well as recreated accounts.  Nobody has commented on the list of
questions I sent earlier... :-)

If we must delete accounts, could we at least send a couple of
warnings first, if the account has an email address registered?  If
the account could be "saved" by logging in, I would find it an
acceptable solution for my purposes.

Last year I went to university, and one of the essays I wrote for
history class was on the history of copper. While researching the essay,
I went to the library and borrowed the book "Copper: Its geology and
economics", by Robert Bowen and Amanda Gunatilaka, published in 1977.

I was the first person ever to have borrowed that book since the library 
had acquired it in 1978. If no-one had been interested in it, why hadn't 
the library thrown it away? Because they had no reason to. They weren't 
running out of space.

Is Codex running out of space? No. Even if it was, would deleting user 
accounts make an appreciable difference? No. Even if it would, would it 
be a good idea for attribution purposes? No. This is entirely a 
psychological problem ("I'm shocked", "I like a clean house", "Anything 
that removes clutter is necessary", etc), not a real one.

The solution to this psychological problem is quite simple: remove the 
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Listusers> page, or at least prevent 
anyone from accessing it.

What does the number of registered editors have to do with how inviting 
it is to vandals? Wikipedia's resilience against vandalism comes from a 
large number of editors, not a small number.

If you really think this is a good idea, I suggest first implementing it 
in WordPress itself. All WordPress sites that haven't been updated in 
six months or more should delete themselves entirely on the next page 
request. It's not a knock against anybody. It's simple blogosphere 
management and maintenance.

I happen to agree with much of what Craig said.

If someone has registered yet made NO contribution, then just what 
exactly IS the point of them remaining in the user list ? I can see none 
whatsoever.
Registering is not mandatory, registering to read is not mandatory so 
why have they registered ? Is it a /just in case/ thing ? Doubtful, really.

Yay ! Codex has 841 contributors ! Crap it has. Let's get it slightly 
more real, space or not eh ?

Codex can establish non-contribution, so why have that function if it 
does not get used ?

Having a codex registration and having done zero with it confers no 
special powers / abilities / whatever on anyone and removing that seems 
nothing more than sense to me.

Things like books are a far cry different than a name on a list that can be 
reentered.  But I totally understand your perspective.  I'm the LAST one in 
the house to get rid of a book, which is a crime as far as I'm concerned. 
When I haven't visited a site for a while, it is VERY common to lose my 
account.  Hotmail, as an example, keeps changing their policies from 90 days 
to 30 days to 10 days and who knows what it is now.  When they are closed, I 
have to sign in and come up with ANOTHER new password or dance the dance 
they want me to dance in order to participate again.  It's very common in 
the online world.

Anyway, I did say that "I" would clean house, but I also said that it wasn't 
up to me to decide.  I leave that to higher powers.

But I did wonder and wish I'd been the one to ask.  We now know that there 
is such a list; that for some, such a list has value; and hopefully, from 
this discussion, there will be guidelines which help future askers of such 
questions understand that the powers that be have thought this out and they 
have come up with a decision on how it is to be handled.

It doesn't sound like you agree that this is how it should be... ?

I am one of those who has registered, but never contributed. I can't
speak for everyone, but perhaps I am representative of a subset of
users. I want to contribute, but I simply cannot grasp the process and
how the Codex works, particularly when it comes to contributing. I am
a professional technical writer and instructional designer, so
writing, version control, etc., is not the problem. I am not a
programmer, but I am a system admin and I understand Windows and Unix.
The problem is that the Codex, as with almost all open source projects
I have looked at (for example, SourceForge) are absolutely counter
intuitive to everything I am familiar with. The new Codex makes it
much easier to finds things, but I am completely stymied by editing
and writing. At some point, I hope to figure it out and contribute. In
the meantime, I would like to remain a user.

So do we have a decision on this ?

1 - Users are NOT removed.
Now this is either an absolute rule or it is pointless. Right now, we 
have a user called "A2gay.org.uk" who has made no contributions. If 
tomorrow I wake and find that we have A3, A4 .... A999 then they stay 
too. Yes ?

2 - We (I'll cheerfully do it) go through and delete ALL users who have 
made no contribution. I would think that a period of warning (a month ?) 
to ask users to create a user page or make a small change anywhere which 
simply indicates that they are there are active.

It's simply about keeping a decent house, and I do not see why we have 
to copy what this wiki or that wiki is doing - it's Codex, we built it, 
we make the rules, and if one of our rules is that you have to have made 
a contribution to stay, then why not ?

I would even say that if you create a User: page, and you are not a 
spammer, that you are never deleted. Okay, so that bit isn't perfect and 
needs some talking, but let's not go down the non-thinking route - which 
is how I see (1) above.
I'm not trying to be inflammatory, but it seems that a suggestion for 
discussion has caused two camps, and I'm sure that both can create the 
bridge with some constructive thinking. This proposal would /never/ have 
been met with such emotion had we all been sat round a table would it ?
Perhaps it should be discussed in #chill ?  :)

I think in the case that someone is clearly abusing the account system 
and codex, it's perfectly alright to delete an account.  This is very 
different from someone just creating an acct and leaving it, imho.

I haven't weighed in on this yet, but I think it's a bad policy given 
that the codex is supposed to be an inclusive project.  Who's to say 
that someone who created an acct got distracted and didn't get to 
contribute?  I know I poked around the codex for quite a while before 
ever posting, and even now I haven't done all that much.  But if I had 
found that my account was deleted because of inactivity, that would've 
been quite discouraging.

Basically, I value making the codex more inviting to occasional editors 
FAR more than saving some user account real estate, which is practically 
free.

In addition, leaving accounts fits the open-source commons that we're 
trying to build with the WordPress community.  It's fine to have a 
meritocracy, and works extremely well, but I don't think that needs to 
conflict with welcoming users and contributors with open arms.  Deleting 
user accounts *can* be perceived as the contributor not being "good 
enough" to be in our club.

Leave no contributor behind.

There are a number of pages in Codex that have the "This article is 
marked as in need of editing. You can help Codex by editing it."

Hm.....wiki pages ALL need editing don't they ? Shouldn't we be making 
plain that ANY page can and should be improved ? By implication, some 
pages are perfect are they not ? I know they aren't, I'm just pointing 
at the tags on some and the no-tags on others.

The {{Copyedit}} tag is for those pages that appear to be in severe
need of editing - no headers, no structure, lots of grammar mistakes,
or just plain some page that the author or visitor feels needs a
little TLC.

All pages can be edited, but some look more out of shape than the others...

The best approach seems to be to take care of problem users on an
individual basis. Let the others be. We could write up a policy
statement listing what/who qualifies as an abusive user. Dormant users
do not pose too much of a problem, and I wonder if a pro-active method
of dealing with them is neccessary.

Matthew, I can always count on you to speak the voice of reason better 
than myself. I laughed out loud at how true this last statement was. 
:-)

In addition to the fact that pruning accounts provides zero maintenance 
benefit, the frequency or infrequency of individual users' contribution 
is frankly none of our business, and monitoring usage could be 
considered an invasion of privacy.

Likewise, we have no business trying to judge whether individual 
accounts are legitimate or not. To use Podz' example, a2gay.org.uk 
looks to me like a perfectly legitimate user, and to remove that user's 
account because it has the word 'gay' in it would be bordering on 
discriminatory. I don't think I need to emphasize how horrific that 
would be.

Playing god with users' accounts is way overstepping our bounds. Our 
sole responsibility is to manage the flow of *content*: organizing the 
*content* users provide, and making sure users have the resources 
available (guidelines, ideas, inspiration) to contribute. If a user 
posts abusive *content*, they get banned. End of story.

This issue is so incredibly black-and-white to me -- and my feelings 
are so overwhelmingly negative on the subject -- that I may even 
threaten to stop contributing to Codex entirely if a pruning policy is 
put into place.

We've already wasted far too much energy debating this; I'd like to 
recommend that we just forget the whole idea and go back to 
content-related issues -- we've been doing an EXCELLENT job with those 
sorts of discussions recently, so let's keep it up!

I, for one, have been oddly distracted by this issue of which I have no 
interest in debating.  I agree that discussing content creation will be 
more fruitful than discussing user maintenence ad nauseum.

With regards to your "decent house" comment: see Matthew Thomas' 
response about this being a purely psychological issue. In the sysadmin 
frame of mind, things like this have no order or disorder: they just 
are.

With regards to the "this wiki or that wiki" comment: I agree that no 
two wikis are the same, and that it would be incredibly irresponsible 
of us to just copy someone else. But any decent wiki must at least 
consider what Wikipedia does, or risk repeating history. Please do not 
discount what Wikipedia does as a valuable model to learn from: turning 
a blind eye to the methods of such a successful site would be equally 
as irresponsible as blindly copying it.

See my other email about playing god with users' accounts. No benefit,

You could ask me however or wherever you want about this issue, and my

Hotmail, and other free email providers, are quite a different story. 
They are an absolute spammers' haven, and in order to keep disk space 
in check, it's become necessary for them to implement usage 
requirements. With the amount of spam they receive, they do have a 
maintenance gain from pruning unused accounts: they reclaim disk space 
used to store nothing but built-up spam. We would have no such gain in 
eliminating unused accounts, so this is a very "apples-to-oranges" 
comparison.

As for it being "very common in the online world," I've never had a 
long-unused account of mine expire anywhere. Then again, I've never 
used a free email account either.

There are benefits to registering on the Codex even if someone doesn't 
contribute, for example saving favorite pages or customizing things. In a 
perfect world no one would have to register and it would be unified with 
the forum/svn user system, but we're not there yet. If there is an 
spamming or abusive user they should be deleted. In the case of a2gay it 
appears to be a legitimate website.

In future disagreements it probably wouldn't hurt to be more sensitive to 
the feelings of other people in the discussion and tailor responses to not 
be so snarky/sarcastic. We're all volunteers here!

"Hm, upgrades...." ~ Neo (Matrix: Reloaded)

Ok, as suggested many times, I'm going to take a major stab at the 
Combating Comment Spam page: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam  Here are my plans so 
far:

Create a separate page for each plugin, captcha, and hack, thus 
reducing the related sections of the main Combating Comment Spam page 
to bulleted lists.

Each separate page will contain the plugin's compatibility, a link to 
the plugin, a full description, and a rating based on five criteria.  
These criteria include ease of installation, ease of use, 
effectiveness, amount of false positives, and amount of issues reported 
on the WP support forums.  An average score will also be presented.  
These criteria will be derived from personal use and WP support forum 
reports.

I plan to start this glorious adventure this weekend.

Any thoughts?

system.  You'll need a plan on what to do when people bump up or down 
your thoughts.  I suppose you'll need to ask that people discuss 
altering ratings only after a discussion on the talk page.  I would bet 
you'll need a pretty good description of the rating system (either on 
the page or on the talk page).  But it sounds like it's in good hands.

Enjoy your glorious adventure.

I would have a page per overall method, and I would not use a rating 
system myself. I can see the point, but by rating them we are swaying 
user choice so possibly reducing the variety of techniques WP users 
employ and this could be considered a strength.
I also think that it will open a huge can of worms of "that plugin is 
better than this" which is best avoided.

Ok, so I missed getting to the Codex yesterday, but NM did a nice job 
of moving the plugins and captcha for me, thanks Moose!  Anywho, the 
page is still cluttered, IMO, and the problem would be the hacks.  So, 
my question is, what would be the group's opinion on removing all hacks 
(and plugins) that are obsolete or no longer compatible with WP v1.5?  
Let the voting begin.

My personal opinion would be to remove *all* hack/plugin listings 
entirely from the Codex. 

It's too much work to maintain.  There are official outlets/listings for 
these things that we can link to that will do a better job of 
maintaining the list.  There's no easy way to tell whether a plugin is 
still supported or is still compatible with WordPress, nor is there a 
way in Codex of contacting the plugin developer for support.  The 
possible implication from listing the plugins is that all plugins are 
endorsed by WordPress, especially if a plugin is *not* listed within a 
genre that it should be.  Some plugins cross over the lines defined by 
the sections that have been constructed.  Listing plugins encourages 
developers to create support pages for their plugins inside the Codex, 
which may confuse users who are looking for support info for other 
plugins in the Codex that are not and will not be documented there.

I'm not as vehemently opposed to this as I seem from the above.  I 
really don't care.  But I've written more than ten plugins, and I have 
no idea how many if any of them are in Codex, nor will I ever provide 
documentation for them there.  Better to direct users to wp-plugins.org, 
which has its own wiki and contains the actual plugin source, should a 
developer decide to drop off the planet someone else can take up the 
support.

Note that most of the above is countrary to what would be good for me 
since only one of my plugins is listed at wp-plugins.org, and only 
because I'm not the only maintainer of that one (Geo).

And those are my thoughts on that, since you asked.  Otherwise, I'd have 
kept my mouth shut.

Seeing as one of the things I hate is wasted effort (I really, really do 
hate it), I'd like to know if the following are truly and permanently 
deprecated (before I go and add them on Codex):

next_posts
previous_posts
next_posts_link
previous_posts_link

These are all said to be deprecated on the old Wiki (in one place or 
another), but I find nothing in the code to support this claim.

I'll still be adding them to Codex, but their priority and the amount of 
effort I put into it is dependent on where they stand.

I agree, but we should leave them there until we have official resources 
on wordpress.org to replace the Codex resources, which we don't yet. 
When that is done I'll ping everyone and this list so we can start 
cleaning up and updating links.

Sorry for the delay.  The sickies and a weekend marathon consumed every bit 
of energy I had.

I've finally put the first "draft" of 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/First_Steps_With_WordPress in my 
user section.  And I need some help.

The goal of the article is to help all those who call themselves newbies and 
noobs take baby steps through the WordPress process.  It might even give old 
"Think-I-Know-Everything" users some new info.

The help I need is to go through the article and find EVERY possible place 
to link to an article in the Codex that will help people get more info. 
Also to highlight the specific terminology that will help teach them the 
jargon of WordPress.  For instance, if the Write Posts panel is mentioned, 
it should be in bold and/or link to an article that takes them step-by-step 
through the process.

This article is also heavily based upon mdawaffe's articles on using the 
various administration panels, so when those are public, I want to link to 
those.

I've tried to keep this as simple and "conversational" as possible to help 
those truly intimidated by the process, with lots of links to expand their 
knowledge.  If I've left something out or said too much, slice and burn.

That really looks great. Why don't we move it to the root namespace and 
then I can do some work on it later.

Thank you Lorelle! I just moved it in right now, since eventually that

Can't I leave you guys alone for a minute!  I said it was DRAFT and I'm 
serious.  Now it's in the public.  A day or three to finish fixing it would 
have been nice. There is SO much to do to fix it.  I want graphics and links 
and .....

I love the enthusiasm, but DRAFT has got to mean something, folks.  This 
isn't a "most important article in the history of WordPress" kind of thing, 
but it is still a working draft and I thought the Codex took us out of 
Wiki-leave-anything-you-want-laying-around-documents.

I'm not complaining but I am complaining.  I have more respect for my work 
than to just throw it out there.  Until I can get to it and really fix on it 
late tonight, somebody better be cleaning it up for the public.  Again, I 
appreciate the enthusiasm, but we also have to respect it when writers 
contribute and ask for help BEFORE the work goes public.

I understand the frustration, but to me that's the point of doing all 
this on a wiki.  People will see your article, see that it needs a poke 
here and there, and poke it.  Most of the time, the pokes will be good 
- sometimes not.  That's when you swoop in like the super-hero you are 
and save the day.

'Release early, release often.'  Not a bad motto.

Thanks, folks.  I have stuff that's been waiting for over a month to get 
released to the big wide world in the Codex, so I figured it took a long 
time for the review process.  I know you all are trying to move things 
faster, but this gave me whiplash.  Tomorrow it will be ready to release - 
if I don't sleep tonight.  Sorry to slap you around, but this was scary.

Okay, cleaned up a lot, added more links, and I added photos, but the upload 
kept giving me problems.  What's the trick?  The photos are "there" but 
invisible in the image page and in the article.

Things to Do - I NEED HELP

1. List of sites using WordPress - examples - I vaguely remember seeing Matt 
or someone collecting some of these. There is also a site, can't remember 
where, that lets WordPress users post their site worldwide on a map.  That 
would be fun.

2. The status (yes or no) on mdawaffe's panel explanations - are they ready 
or not.  If yes, please add these links willy nilly in the article.

3.  Images - I've got some of them in the article, but more waiting in the 
wings.  I need help on making those visible.

I get good answers to these in the morning, then it can go public.  Thanks 
again for understanding my panic.

I have been spending the past hour trying to figure out why some
thumbnails work, while some dont. One of your thumbnails is displayed
properly, the others are not. I tried replacing the file
kubricksingle.png with Kubricksingle.png, even Kubrick_Single.png. I
tried different kinds of wiki syntax, nothing works.

I guess I will have to appeal to the mediawiki gurus here!

The pics are visible in the article page for me. It may be invisible
to you if you are using IE, and the images are png (non-indexed)
transparencies.

Carthik.

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/Well_Designed
and
http://wp.trendyname.org/topsites/ 
is probably what you might want. 
The map showing WP blogs 'round the world is not ready. Me and Podz
each have/had one but I don't think mine is world-ready really :) and
I cant find Podz' page.

MDAWaffe, what do you say? Clean up and move in? I am fine with it, if
it is useful in such occasions as these, and others.

I spent a good two hours, read all there is to be read at mediawiki,
wikipedia, looked up bugs at the mediawiki bugzilla, asked at
#mediawiki and #wikipedia even. Nada.
Matt, is this another of the mediawiki quirks? Mediawiki turns out to
be more mysterious and quirky than a teenager, at times.

On last update on the Image thumbnail issue :

It appears that some thumbnail urls work :
http://codex.wordpress.org/images/thumb/7/7f/180px-Admin_Panel_Write_Post_1.5.png

while some dont:
http://codex.wordpress.org/images/thumb/0/0e/180px-viewsitelink.png

The one that does is a file that was uploaded a long time ago by MDAWaffe.

The one that does not has an URL that leads to a Codex Page. I beleive
the rewrite rules are messed up in some fashion. The one kind soul at
#mediawiki who responded knows not how to fix this, and I couldn't
provide any details about the setup, so it calls for Matt's swiss
knife, I guess.

Message-ID: <001801c52f68$872bdc30$6601a8c0@silver>

What once was called "Designing Themes for Contests" should now be known as 
"Designing Themes for Public Release"....unless there are any other shouts 
from the title experts...is ready for release to the public...ha!

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Designing_Themes_for_Contests

Over the next couple of weeks I will slice and dice the article down so 
validation and a few other sections are actually mini-articles with only a 
call out to them from this main article. But the information is good and 
needed so it can go out until I get the rest of the articles done.

Release away, folks.

Oh, almost forgot.  This is the first of the Lesson series started on the 
forum. What's the scoop on having a Lessons - Tutorials - 
whateveritiscalled - section on the Codex?  I've got a bunch more to do and 
while they will fit into the whole, it would be nice to have them 
highlighted as tutorials.

This seems like [[Theme Development]]'s brother, or sister.

While the pages are entirely different, they address different parts
of the same question.

I would think that Lorelle's page could be called [[Designing Themes]]
and the [[Theme Development]] page could be rolled in, or vice-versa.

With a lot of articles, the size of the articles is getting really
really long -- too long to hold the reader's attention.

What about splitting these articles, with the parent article and
subpages of the parent, with the rext from the different sections in
the article? We could have ""next page >>" and "previous page" links
on the articles and thus provide continuity, and keep the reader's
attention and interest.

Please voice opinions.

This could help starting with Lorelle's page here.

Carthik.

Fine with me.  Since writing them and talking about them here, however,  
I've come to Matt's conclusion that they are not as useful as other  
documentation (in the sense that they will not be as frequently used)  
and to your conclusion, Carthik, that they are a pain to write and  
maintain.  To continue with the name dropping, though, I still hold  
with Podz' view that this stuff needs to be documented since there may  
be people who find the articles very useful, and with Morgan's that any  
good documentation will have such a section.

I've convinced myself that the best solution is to include better  
descriptions within WordPress itself (with links to Codex as necessary)  
about what every bit does.  But maybe those descriptions/links will  
come from these articles.

http://codex.wordpress.org/User: 
MDAWaffe#Administration_Panel_Documentation
I think they're ready to go in.

What they need:
Import links needs help
Upload needs help
[[Discussion Options]] needs redirect from [[Discussion SubPanel]] (or  
needs to be renamed)
Wikification
Screenshots with numbered and/or colored regions - preferably Firefox
And some other stuff I can't think of, but hopefully you all can.

Huh?  Did I miss something.  I refer to them all the time when giving help 
on the forums - but I haven't linked to them yet.  They are brilliant for 
the ill-equiped who call themselves "noob" to get the step-by-step process 
of things, spelled out.  I don't know what exactly needs to be "maintained" 
unless there is a serious update in the program's interface.  In fact, I 
think a link to these pages from the interface would be great to help 
explain what this and that does.  Whether people need it or not.

May I just say as a fascinated observer, (ok then, lurker ;-) ) that this  
stuff is absolutely brilliant, and will provide a much needed resource for  
all WP users out there that are just starting out with css, and standards  
conformance. Since joining this list I have been using the new wiki almost  
daily, and would have been completely lost without it. Thank you to  
everyone for all your time and effort. I have been checking to see how I  
can contribute myself, but being quite new to WP, I am not sure what I can  
do, as yet. :-(
I am becoming more proficient by the day however, so hopefully something  
will need doing that I can do, sooner or later.
I think the tutorials idea is great, btw, as I used to write tutorials for  
Paint Shop Pro beginners, and do know how time-consuming they can be to  
write, but again, I also know from feedback, how incredibly helpful they  
can be to newbies and intermediate users.
Sorry to butt in, but just wanted to give a bit of user-feedback, and as  
soon as I am competent enought to help, I will :-)

Jewel, and the others who want to contribute but don't know how folks out 
there lurking,

Like most of you, I loved the possibilites of WordPress - and didn't cringe 
at the "free" part, but guilt kept nagging me.  I decided to look around and 
see what I could do.  I didn't know a php from a pot to piss in, but I've 
been doing technical writing for years so I figured that a poke and a prod 
at the occassional missed spell and bad grammer might ease my guilt at the 
"free" part.  Especially since I was having so much fun (albeit many a 
moment of pulling hair) with WordPress.

I realized that some of the folks writing the material in the Codex were 
hardened criminals - I mean hardened WordPress gurus, calloused and 
desensitized to the stress and determination of the "newbie".  (I can 
picture the developers now, hunched backs from hauling years of PHP code in 
sacks slung over their backs, sweat pouring from their brow, grease from 
digging into the innards of mySQL and back-breaking code sequences.....Ain't 
I the clever word girl, today!  ;-)  ) The hard stuff was coming out but the 
simple "how do I make sense out of this massively insane nested list thing 
in the sidebar" type issues weren't being addressed very well in the new 
codex.  As a newbie in WordPress, I could ask the dumb questions that the 
masses were asking, and make sure that the dumb answers would start 
appearing in the Codex to help other newbies like me.

In other words:

NEWBIES WANTED

Leap in, give us your "how comes" and "what fors".  This isn't the place to 
get technical support, but if there is an issue that isn't being covered, we 
need to know.  If there is an issue you needed to know about and figured 
out, which probably applies to a couple other thousand folks out there, then 
write something up.  Massacre and destroy the English (or whatever) 
language, just get it down and the rest of us will fix it and save other 
people the grief you suffered in the learning process.

Now that I've been hanging around for a while, they sucked me in from being 
a lurking editor to a contributing pain in their buns, so if you enjoy it, 
you will stick around.  But we need your contribution, okay!  Pick up a 
shovel and start digging.  We need you!

And don't worry.  Like all freebie volunteer efforts, we're no different. 
The abuse will come soon enough. hee hee.

Hi,
I have to agree with Lorelle's point, I have been lurking a litte on
the Codex and this list for a few weeks now and have also seen some of
my handy work be questioned. I have never used Media Wiki before but
have found it to be a powerful and flexible  tool. Lorelle's point is
completely valid & has to be respected, those of us who use the Codex
will follow the guidlines that have been set out on the site and for
this reason the enthusiasm shown by some has to be kept in check, if a
page is in a 'User' area then it should be treated as Work in Progress
/ Draft etc etc I don't know the specific admin featurs available to
Media Wiki but it would seem appropriate in some ways to notify users
& contributers that this is the case, maybe a Template?

Ok, just going to pick up my shovel now.:-)

  My current silly irritation, is why I cant get the quicktags toolbar to  
appear correctly above the comments form. I tried Owen Winkler's plugin,  
but the buttons that appear are ridiculously huge, and no amount of css  
styling will reduce them in size. I want them to be styled roughly the  
same as the toolbar in the write post panel.  I believe, (or think I read  
somewhere), that there is a method of using the quicktags.js  in comments,  
but have found no info about this anywhere, apart from said plugin. Maybe  
info about this could go in the comments section?  (I am using Kubrick  
with my own css modifications, but the basic template is reasonably  
fundamentally unchanged.btw if this is relevant).

The Deny Access section of the Combatting Comment Spam document deals 
largely with blocking IP addresses.  Time and time again this has been 
proven as practically useless beyond the stretch of a week.  Don't get 
me wrong, blocking IPs is great for breaking up floods, but the spam 
bots come back with a new IP in a week at most.  Origninally, this 
section came from Podz' combatting comment spam page, but hould this 
section remain?  Also, it deals primarily with .htaccess techniques 
found by searching Google.  Does it even belong in the Codex?  Another 
thing to consider is confusion for new users.  We don't want anyone to 
think that blocking spam with WordPress is difficult.

Arguably, we do not get questions because that info is there.
My pov ? Not bothered, but could you save me a copy so I can do the

Eek.  Where's your site?  Email me off-list and I'll take care of it 
right after dinner (which is going on while I type this - my wife is 
going to beat me again...).  Be sure the plugin is active until we get 
the problem fixed, ok?  I *will* email you.

Hm, as a compromise, would someone blessed with more Codex power than 
I, consider moving the "Deny Access" content to a new page?  Perhaps a 
sub-page?  Honestly, I don't mind, as long as it isn't on Combatting 
Comment Spam.  It just takes up too much space, it's too confusing for 
new users, and it's not entirely WP-related (information can be found 
via a quick Google search).

Subject: [wp-docs] Preparing for 1.5+
Message-ID: <002d01c53020$ab2802e0$6601a8c0@silver>

After totally messing up a bunch of files in WordPress, AND wanting some 
plugins that are coming out now that say they work "best" in 1.5.1alpha, and 
ignoring all warnings that say "don't play in this sandbox unless you know 
what you are doing", I thought I'd risk it.

My mouth is hanging open from just a couple minutes of use.  WOW.  I adore 
the new plugin color coding to show off activated plugins.  Very slick 
indeed.

Now, thinking WAY ahead of the game, I'd like to start a thread in here, 
with maybe a private user page or something hidden deep in the Codex, that 
lists some of the topics that will need to be covered in the new release, 
whenever the new release comes.  Just thinking ahead.  Here are a few of the 
things I noticed right off that will NEED to be in the Codex and forum 
volunteers will need to be prepared, unless an update comes that "fixes" the 
issues.

* Mention of the new color coding on the Plugins - Honestly - I am so 
thrilled with that feature!

* Upon install, and after running UPGRADE, all plugins are deactivated. 
This has a couple of consequences:

      ** Need to inform people that they should print out the plugins page 
before installing the new version so they can have a list of what they had 
activated or not activated.

     ** Plugins which require tags, like custom posts, meta tags (keywords), 
and other manually inserted tags may choke when the user clicks "you're done 
now visit your site" from the Upgrade page.  The site will load and report 
errors on the first plugin tag it finds that isn't activated.  If this 
continues, maybe the "click here" button needs to go to the Login page with 
a recommendation to turn on any plugins....I'm not the tech, but this might 
have to be addressed in troubleshooting.  I freaked for a moment when the 
page came up with an error in the header and nothing else loaded from that 
point.  But I knew how to track it down.

    ** Writing Options and been improved and the ability to control the size 
of the writing box is brilliant.  I was just going to look up all my admin 
hacks to start enforcing changes when I started writing this email and 
poking around look at changes - this is one big time saver for me!

  ** This might be also with 1.5, but in poking around I just found out that 
ALL of the 500+ articles I imported into WP came in with me as author at 
level 1.  I saw the minus in front and thought, $%&*, they think I'm a minus 
1 user.  How could I have screwed that up.  Since this new "me" is now the 
second user on the site, I searched for over 30 minutes to figure out that 
the minus isn't a condemnation of my user level but a BUTTON.  We need to 
make sure this info on how to change the user level is in the User Level 
page on the Codex, a current feature or one to come, I don't care.  Why 
isn't there some text on under the title on that Panel that says "click the 
+ or - to change user levels."

   ** Theme Editor - I don't remember seeing this before.  Is it new? Got to 
write about it.  Absolutely BRILLIANT.  I gave up trying to use the built in 
editor because I didn't want to write the long URL to get there.  This is 
awesome.

I'm sure I'll find more but anyone who is using the new version, we need to 
start making a list of what needs to go in the codex for it, and catch 
anything missing that should be in for 1.5, too.  New stuff that is old 
stuff looks new when viewed from a different angle.

To the developers - AWESOME award winning improvements so far.

I do not mess with User pages unless it is to update links on the User
page that point to some deleted page.

In this particular case, I moved it in, since she announced it, and I
thought it was ready to be moved in, and that's what she'd wanted.

When she told me it wasn't so, I undid my changes and informed everyone of it.

Please feel free to point out any incorrect actions in any of the above.

That a page is a User: page is sort of like a Template, so i do not
think we need a template to mark user pages. There is a "new page
created" template that was used when the standard way was to create
User: pages and then tag it when it's ready to be moved in. i guess we
can continue to use that.

Carthik.

James,

It is informative, in my personal opinion, and is one method useful
for combatting comment spam. Using htaccess to deny access is
something that is well written about, but how exactly a user would
think of using that to solve the spam problem without a cue from the
combatting comment  spam page is unclear to me?

Is it that great an eye-sore?

The information is not outdated, redundant, or misleading. Maybe we
can add a line that says that it is effective in stopping floods, and

Lorelle, 

I am with you in that we need a good changelog - which was so
difficult for 1.5 since there was so much that was new. It is possible
for 1.5.1 though, and you can start a new sub page of [[Changelog]] to
start building one.

As regards documenting how to use the various features, they need to
be done, one by one, or over a week of dedicated work. I never get to
the point where I can spare a bunch of hours to the Codex - though I
can spare a few minutes every now and then to reply to mails, check
edits etc. Please start on the pages if you'd like to, and do not
hesitate to create new pages. Managing the new pages is less difficult
that creating them from scratch ;)

Great work, Lorelle, you amaze me!

Carthik.

I'm just considering the fact that it is, as of now, the second largest
section of that page compared to the Default Tools list. As per human
nature, an new user will read the page in this order: Q/A, Default
Tools, and Deny Access. I think it would be beneficial to move the
section to a subpage and link to it. That keeps Combatting Comment Spam
as primarily an explanation of default tools and a hub to other options.

Well, I've taken care of the clutter presented by the Denying Access 
section (I figured out how to create a subpage) and I've even added 
content to it as well (imagine that, a section on using .htaccess to 
deny spam referrers).  I think this will work out for the best.  The 
Combatting Comment Spam page is now, IMO, as it should be.

In First Steps, I've mentioned that people who are having trouble with 
themes should check out Troubleshooting Themes.  I was sure I saw something 
somewhere about this, but I now can't find it.

Is there such a page?

And what's the story on the pics?  Anything yet?

I am not aware of a Troubleshooting Themes page, maybe it is a section
of some other page?

About the pics - no new news. Matt must be busy. I figure a - [L]
rewrite rule for the /images/* directories should fix it.

I am on this list but have never edited the codex. Forgive me for asking but
I don't see your personal note? Can you reiterate here or did you just do
so? :)

No moving from server to server is not the same but much is outside the
realm of WP. I havbe moved my blog around several times and it is quite
simple to do an account transfer from cPanel but not everyone has cPanel. If
they don't, here are rough steps (some outside of WP)

Assuming the user can handle DNS changes for the domain:

1. Create a new database on the new server.
2. Dump current database to the new one. Easy way for newbies is to use
phpMyAdmin to export from one then login to the other and import. However,
if SSH is enabled on the new server and remote mysql access is enabled on
the old server, the simplest method is to run:

bash$ mysqldump -h hostname -u username -p password wp_database | mysql -u
newuser -p newpassword new_wp_database

3. Backup all files from old server, usually through FTP download to local
and upload to new, though I like direct copy via scp from one server to the
other.

4. Edit wp-config.php with new database details.

5. IF DNS resolution has been completed, login to wp-admin and change any
necessary details for the new location, including permalink structures (if
necessary). If DNS resolution is not complete, it might help in the interim
to modify wp_options values for home and siteurl so it's not redirecting the
user to the old server while DNS changes.

There's a lot to cover. Using a cPanel account copy is the easiest though if
available for the user as you just put in account details on the old server
and it copies over. If the user does not have WHM access, they may need to
supply info to the host.

To move
www.example.com/testblog
to
www.example.com/blog
just rename the directory, then using phpmyadmin alter the 'site_url' 
and 'home' values.
That's it.

Also, if you define RELOCATE in wp-config.php, WP will try to update the
siteurl for you next time you log in.

Oh, wow, my second bug report!

Ryan, is there a change log yet for alpha that we can look at and consider 
how to add info to the Codex? Just thinking ahead.  And thanks!

Also, if you define RELOCATE in wp-config.php, WP will try to update the
siteurl for you next time you log in.

Subject: [wp-docs] Wiki Weekend is THIS WEEKEND
Message-ID: <005401c530f0$0c1a9480$6601a8c0@silver>

I feel neglected folks.  Wiki Weekend is this weekend.  I posted AGES ago a 
long list, per request, of things I thought might be good to have migrated 
over from the old codex and a couple of people have posted comments about 
those - which is great - http://codex.wordpress.org/Talk:Wiki_Day and I've 
been adding to them.  I've set up a list of things for me to do on my user 
page.

I've also asked a whole bunch about how this is going to work and if 
assignments are going to be handed out or just DONE - and all I know is that 
there will be an IRC chat open on #wp-docs....but have reminders gone out - 
or am I stepping on toes - what's going to happen and how.

I'm excited about this and ready to get a lot of work done.  I told my hubby 
to go play in a corner and leave me alone all weekend, and he's thrilled. 
I've bought glue to stick my buns to the computer chair and I'm well stocked 
on water and celery sticks - so what's the score?

Recently, I moved from http://example.com/test to http://example.com by

1) Logging in as admin, changing the URL for the blog and WordPress
using the options page
2) moving the files in <webroot>/test to <webroot>/

That worked fine.

Ryan's method looks good too. Probably undefining RELOCATE after the
move would be better, too.

Subject: [wp-docs] Troubleshooting Themes - Got a Problem with a Theme?
Message-ID: <008101c5314a$04df9670$6601a8c0@silver>

I'm going to put together a Troubleshooting Themes article for the Codex and 
I need some help and input.  What problems or challenges have you 
encountered installing and using themes?  If it is something like "I didn't 
like the color of the header", we got that one.

We're looking for issues involving:

* Downloading and installing Themes

* Choosing and Viewing Themes - I'm hearing a lot of "uploaded them and now 
I can't see the themes I uploaded" and "I chose my theme but there is 
nothing but white on my screen - no theme" on the forums - I need to review 
these for answers but if you know the answer - pop it in here!

* Theme Author Issues - Common design or coding mistakes and where to get 
more help on these in addition to the Developing Themes articles

* Template Issues - Missing templates, damaged templates, replacing 
templates, template for main page and categories but different for single, 
template for main page and single but different for categories....

* Loop Issues - Changing from excerpt to whole post or reverse. Having the 
Loop's conditional tags call single.php if single, category.php if category, 
etc.

* Changing The Theme - where to look for which part in which templates, 
using a sandbox, tracking down CSS references in the generated HTML and the 
style.css.....

* Plugins in Themes - may cause problems if the plugin tag is present but 
the plugin isn't activated. Other "plugins in themes" issues - specifically 
downloaded themes with plugins not adding plugins to a theme afterwards.

* What else?  I know there is something or three I've missed.

I will also include links in the article to Troubleshooting CSS, Browser 
Bugs, Theme Development and the rest.  I want to keep this similar to the 
FAQ so it is question and answer solutions or more information.

Pitch in and pick up the shovel folks - I need some questions and answers on 
these issues so I can maybe take a good crack at it this Wiki Weekend.

I didn't even know there was a Codex:Community Portal.  These are the 
guidelines and all - so copied from the other pages into this?  If so, we 
need to make sure the changes went with it.  I did a LOT of editing on the 
guidelines not long ago but I haven't checked to see if they are there. 
This is a great page!!!

There is a link to the Community portal off of the sidebar (on the
left) on all Codex pages.

I included the guidelines into this page since I believed a lot of new
users might click the link in the sidebar to know more.

Subject: [wp-docs] Wiki Weekend - Editing Help and Comments
Message-ID: <000c01c533ae$3c572f80$6401a8c0@silver>

Oh, the Codex editing help page and I became best friends and worst enemies 
over the weekend.  I left a note on some "wishes" for modifying it on its 
discussion page, but some issues came up that are "bigger" to discuss since 
they may apply to all of us working on the documentation pages.

ONE
At the bottom of each page is usually a RELATED section of links to topics 
related to the article.  Some tags in the Template Tags were not in their 
right category "stub" listing.  When it was obvious that this was "wrong", I 
changed it to the right "related in same category" by copying the stub from 
a related category that had it right.

But it got me thinking.  How does a, for instance, template tag get into a 
"related category"?  These are generated automatically with a {{tag}}.  And 
not all pages have these, though most do.

I'd love to see "related" items on the Main Page sub pages to help people 
find related informatoin about the topics at hand.  Can we add it there?  Is 
this something the sysop does or can anyone editing do that?  I think that's 
a wonderful feature and I'd love to see it on all the pages, when possible.

----------
TWO
I had a terrible time "faking" links in the visual examples of some of the 
tags and in the Lessons articles I'm working on.

I decided to create a link to the page I was on, so if I was on 
Template_Tags/wp_list_pages then my intra-article faked link would be 
something like

[[Template_Tags/wp_list_pages#Example_1|link text here]]

Instead, it turned the link "bold" without a link reference.  I fought with 
this for hours until I figured out that in the Codex, you can't link to the 
page you are on.  It kills the link.  So I had to find another way of 
creating an example fake link in order for people to "see" the visual 
results of the tag's usage.

Carthik finally helped me by suggesting that I use [[#|link title]] to cause 
a non-action link to the same page.  Didn't work.  The # takes the user to 
the Main Page of the Codex. That's too far a jump for a user to face and 
time wasting to hit the back button.

Since the template tags I was working on all had ==Examples== in the example 
section title, I ended up using [[#Examples|link title]] to cause the user 
who might click on the link example to link to the Examples section - where 
they are already viewing anyway, so it's a minor jump in the page.  Or I 
would use the sub-section title like ===Excluding Categories=== as 
[[#Excluding_Categories|link title]] to keep the "jump" close by.

By removing the actual page title in the link, the link would "work".

We need to add this information (or improve my process) to the Editing Help 
article for intra-article links.

----------------
THREE
When using a DIV to stylize an example, and there is a list inside of the 
example in the Codex, I can't just put

<div style="blah">* Item One
 * Item Two
* Item Three....</div>

The list then looks like this (+=proper bullet and *=asterick symbol - no 
bullet):

* Item One
+ Item Two
+ Item Three....

In other words, in order to SEE the proper bullet and not an asterick, I 
have to order the list with a line break after the DIV:

<div style="blah">
* Item One
* Item Two
* Item Three....</div>

And then it looks right.

+ Item One
+ Item Two
+ Item Three....

Is this a bug or a "supposed to work this way" in the codex?

If you "edit" (screw it up and you'll be shot!) my article 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Stepping_Into_Template_Tags in the 
sections where I show off what a category list would be, simply delete the 
line break after a div so it looks like the first example, and then preview, 
you will see the first line item turn into an asterick...at least I hope you 
will.  If not...well, this is just another visit to an auto mechanic and you 
can forget I brought it up.

----------------------
FOUR
This is just a humble opinion style issue, but I'd really like to see a 
little more "space" between the last paragraph of the section above and the 
sub-section title.  In other words, add some padding or a margin to the 
section titles to give them a little more breathing room.  Sometimes it 
feels like they are sitting on top of each other and crowded.  I usually put 
a double space between the section ending paragraph and the next section 
title.  If I'm using a PRE or code box before the section title, it sits 
right on top of the section title.

I'd also like to see a tad more space between OL and UL lists.  Not a 
centimeter or two, but a millimeter or three little bit more space.  If you 
add an extra line space in an OL list, your list numbers are

1. list text
1. list text
1. list text

Just a little thing that has annoyed me since day one.  I like SPACE around 
my writing and examples and trying to force them within the Codex has 
unpleasant effects sometimes.

-------------------
FIVE

No five, but give me a chance.  I'm still processing the stuff I did over 
the weekend....hee hee....got to work on that evil laugh in text.

Subject: [wp-docs] Lessons: Opinions Welcome...maybe
Message-ID: <000d01c533ae$3d595d40$6401a8c0@silver>

I've started the WordPress Lessons section on my user page at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle#Articles_for_Lesson_Tutorials and 
started to group them together by category.  In doing so, I'm having some 
trouble figuring out where to put things and what categories should be 
included.  I talk about this on my user page and have opened up a debate on 
my discussions page about this.  Chime in, please.

I've done roughs of a bunch of the proposed lessons and posted them.  Please 
review, slash, and burn, but remember, I haven't even had a chance to do 
much of a second or third go around with these.

I talked with Carthik for a few minutes this weekend about the title of the 
WordPress Lessons and I really like calling them WordPress Lessons.  If you 
have an opinion on that, let us know, but I like the idea of that name and 
then using the linking technique of calling them "Lesson: How to dn 
Something" when linked to from other pages on the codex that require an 
article title.  Stands out, says what it is, differentiates it from 
technical documentation as a how-to, and...well, what do you think?

And he mentioned listing this on the Main Page as a separate section. I 
think that is wise since it is of benefit to the majority of WordPress 
Users.  WordPress is so EASY to use, a lot of people are embracing it and 
then wanting to dig in to find out more, so I think this is a good thing. 
It will lead people to dig deeper into the Codex to the rest of the 
documentation by giving them a non-lethal, non-tech intro with links to the 
lethal tech material...ah ha! BURN!  ;-)

Now, about those Lesson articles.

Please review the Lessons very carefully.  On the more technical issues 
involving some template tags, I've test driven most of the, but not all of 
them, so double check that I didn't screw up a tag or code example. 
Remember - I still very much a newbie at how WordPress works and a tired 
stip of the hinger and dah code ez messed upped. And remember again, I 
haven't even gone through them since cleaning them up enough to post.  I'm 
sure I screwed up in places.

About Lessons Guidelines and Purpose:
I've also added a very rough draft and start to some guidelines for 
submission to the Lesson section.  This is NOT meant to turn into official 
guidelines but to help me (and all you wonderful and worthy Codex helpers) 
process what we want and don't want out of these lessons.

PLEASE chime in on these.

The basic goal of the Lessons in the Codex is to help people learn how to 
use WordPress, especially how to use the tags, process the overwhelming 
information and technology that goes into the WordPress features, and how to 
maximize these features on their own WordPress site.

The number one criteria for inclusion in Lessons, IMHO, is that the lesson 
must benefit the MAJORITY of WordPress users, not the minority.

I am not qualified to write on techie how to topics for WordPress, but I'd 
love to have people submit Lessons on techie topics such as how to change 
the excerpt and post content text area in the Admin to make it larger or 
smaller; understanding more about how pingbacks, trackbacks, and RSS works 
in relationship to a WordPress site.  For example, do these help your link 
popularity and rise in the search engines? Does the user have to "turn it 
on" or is it on by default?  Can they turn them off? What good do they do? 
How can they be customized to do what you want?  Sure, the tags and glossary 
and a few pages list some of this information, but a how-to-use on these 
would be great.

I'm sure there are plenty of other techie topics that I would absolutely 
love to see added, but I'm tired out from Weekend Wikiness and I'll post 
suggestions on my user page later.

So go through the Lessons and take a look.  If the link is red - obviously I 
haven't added anything yet.  Still working on them.  Sorry that they are 
"empty" pages, but this is MY USER PAGE and not for the general public.  The 
red link reminds/haunts/guilts/encourages me to get the article done.

:::As a reminder to those new on the discussion group, these Lessons started 
out as a cover for when the Codex was down for an extended period and v1.5 
had just come out and people were going nuts on how to use it.  We posted 
"Lesson: title of lesson" on the WordPress forum and they were a big hit. 
Requests came in to preserve this information and to add such information to 
the Codex to benefit all WordPress users.  From there...avalanche.

Subject: [wp-docs] Wiki Weekend - Template Tags
Message-ID: <000b01c533ae$3aab5440$6401a8c0@silver>

I went through ALL of the template tags and changed each Example 1, Example 
2, etc. to a title that "describes" the example. This should better help 
those looking for specific examples and having to translate the paragraph 
and code to figure out what the example is about.  More user friendly.

I also left a few "notes" in the discussion section on some tags when I had 
a question about usage and how that usage was displayed in the examples. 
Hopefully Kaf, or whoever will check those and help answer the question and 
improve the examples of the tags.

I also started creating a "Default Usage" as the first example for some of 
the more complicated tags.  Going through the list of parameters, it's often 
hard to see what is the default and then remember what it is when you start 
filling in all the quotes and boolean - include, not include, how to 
include - so I created a "list" of the default returns on a tag in the 
Default Usage example to show what would happen if the tag was just used as 
<?php the_tag(); ?> and no parameters set.  I found that incredibly helpful, 
and I hope others will.  If not - delete it.

When possible and appropriate, I added a "graphic" representation of the tag 
results with CSS to help the user better understand the result.

When applicable, I added three examples, growing in complexity, for the 
template tag to help the user better understand the optional uses.  For the 
really complex tags, we might consider adding more, especially for the 
popular categories, archives, and Pages tags.

I wanted to add a visual example of the results of the archives tags, but I 
don't use them and I'm not familiar with what the results would "look" like. 
Give me some text examples and I'll go in and add the CSS around them, but I 
didn't want to assume.

I cleaned up not only the examples, but on a few of the tags I reworded a 
few of the descriptions to make it easier to read.  I do hope I didn't mess 
up and change the meaning of any of the tags, or screw up the example so it 
won't work....so double check, please.

Tags without parameters or examples other than default usage, I checked and 
then left alone for the most part.

Also, when possible I test drove some of the tags to understand their usage 
better.  If it borked, it could be because I didn't understand how it worked 
or there's a problem with the tag.  I left a note in the discussion area of 
these tags.  In particular, I had terrible problems with the link_pages() 
tag which I can reproduce the stylized effect, but the default "Page 1 2 3" 
shows up anyway so I have two tags on any post that has mulitple pages. 
That's not fun.  Since I couldn't find anywhere where the link_pages was 
being generated by default (must be built-in somewhere), I left a note to 
figure how how this works so others won't use the tag and get the same 
double paging results.  The Codex article should show how this tag REALLY 
works in the real world.

And mucho THANKS to the whoevers who put together the template tags menu and 
pages.  Wow.  A serious amount of work.  I only hope my humble fussings 
improved them and complemented the work already there.

There's more, but this is enough for one post.

Hey I noticed that my Seasonal CSS plugin was linked at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Styles.

 

Could this be temporarily removed? 

 

The first reason is it is mislinked.

 

The second is that the plugin is a 1.2 plugin. I haven't updated it to 1.5
and we don't need to be misleading folks. :-)

 

Thanks!

doing so, I figured I would just send an email to the list. :)

Subject: [wp-docs] Search Engines Grab Users
Message-ID: <000a01c5354b$066e2bf0$6401a8c0@silver>

As exciting as that headline is, the ROUGH DRAFT articles I posted in my 
user section have already been grabbed by Google and others.  Looking for 
something else, a couple of my Lessons articles popped up, posted 3 days 
ago.

While it is exciting that WordPress's Codex is tops on the priority list for 
search engines to troll, by allowing user sections and articles in rough 
draft form there a lot of trouble could be had in WordPress city.  While I 
work overtime to make sure the information is as accurate as possible, I 
rely upon other editors to catch my boo boos and fix things before they are 
released to the public, especially the technical things.  Which is why I'm 
so specific about asking for the help I need to ensure the document's 
accuracy.

Now this information, and who knows what else, is out there for the world to 
see and put into action - AND IT COULD BE VERY WRONG ADVICE.

There are a couple of possibilities on handling this that I see, but the 
admin folks should get everyone's input on this.

1. Make USER pages unfriendly to search engines with a nofollow or whatever 
in the redirects.

2. Make sure every user who submits material to the Codex, via their user 
page or a public page, that is in ROUGH DRAFT form, understand that this 
information will be in the public view immediately and it must be triple 
checked for accuracy before posting, making it a "draft" not a "rough 
draft".

3.  Either created by the Codex with some kind of stub thing or manually by 
the user (with clear instructions), the first words on the user's rough 
draft page should read:  ROUGH DRAFT - AWAITNG CHECK FOR ACCURACY - 
INFORMATION SUBJECT TO CHANGE - USE AT OWN RISK - or something like that to 
warn the user that we may not be perfect but we try.  When the article is 
awaiting release, this could be changed to: FINAL DRAFT - AWAITING RELEASE. 
This would also give the sysops a clue that this article is "done" as far as 
someone who thinks they know better thinks.

I might be making an Everest out of a pimple, but I'm worried that, 
especially on my template tag examples, someone is going to totally bork 
their WordPress because of a left out comma or wrong advice.

So what do you all think?

I've been kind of lurking here for a few days and following this with 
interest and this is my take:

I'm a retired computer programmer so I'm not entirely an airhead when 
it comes to computer stuff, BUT when I encounter something that is new 
to me, I do "RTFM" and if the manual - or in this case the WIKI - is 
wrong either because someone posted bad information in an attempt to 
mislead people (hey, it happens) or as Lorelle is saying her posts are 
intended as drafts, how am I to know?

If I was new to WordPress and followed incomplete information, it would 
turn me off and I would not likely ever return.

There are a bazillion blogware apps out there. I've tried lots and 
abandoned them all in favor of WordPress because here I found the best 
information.

Please don't let that deteriorate.

"wiki" and "codex" are geek words. There are lots of people who will be 
drawn to blogging and WordPress because of it's ease of use who will 
not know what those words mean or what the implications of having 
information housed in a wiki might be. In my humble opinion, it's not 
the right way to go for documentation that's being rolled out to the 
public.

Take care, Margaret

Subject: [wp-docs] Lesson on Writing a Custom 404 page or result
Message-ID: <003101c53591$251f8580$6401a8c0@silver>

I've been hunting on and off for a couple days to see if there is something 
specific on the Codex or otherwise on creating a custom 404 response in WP 
and how to create the 404.php if the Theme doesn't come with it.

I've learned little, unfortunately, and I think this would be a good Lesson 
to add.  I need to know if this information is already in the Codex, and 
where, and if not, tips on what people are doing to create their 404.php 
file and customed response from within the Loop on Page Not Found.

One person on the chats told me that they use wp_get_archives() in their 
Loop to generate the most recent posts to help lost people.  That's neat.  I 
asked about which file to use as a template in order to base a new 404.php 
template file on, and didn't get much help on that.  I'm not sure how much 
of the Loop to leave in or out and how to edit it....etc.

Anyway, any tips and resources to help put together such a Lesson would 
really help people, I'm sure.

Thanks for the wise words and opinion on this, Margaret.  I'm glad I'm not 
the only one worried about this.  I hope others chime in, one way or another 
so the sysops have some idea about the feelings and techniques to make a 
decision one way or the other on this.

Like I said, I'm thrilled that the Codex is scanned so quickly by the search 
engines, but dismayed at what they are collecting.

I made a quick and dirty (=lots of tables) visual representation of

in need of a visual aid to understand better how things work

If anyone can use it, feel free to do so. If you have suggestions how
to make it better, you are welcome.

I'm double posting this to both the hackers and docs list. I'm not
sure if this is a documentation error on the codex, a bug in
WordPress, or both. My current guess is both.

According to the codex [1], If you supply a function to
add_submenu_page, that function would be called to display the content
and the plugin file would not be included for its page. From what I
can see after the past two hours of headaches surfing the source code,
the function is not called, and rather a hook is created with the
function name supplied. Not only that, but even if a function is
supplied, it still tries to include the page, because somewhere in the
get_plugin_page_hookname and get_plugin_page_hook there is a bug that
results in the hook not being returned, and thus the conditional on
line 46 of admin.php fails, which causes the file to be included.
Someone please, help out on this, its killing me.
