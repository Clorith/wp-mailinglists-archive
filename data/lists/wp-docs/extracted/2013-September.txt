Subject: [wp-docs] Copyedit: Creating a Static Front Page
Message-ID: <CAPdLKqemDgO720A6jKnP11stT-sk2x0NUbDXyWEEB6yfLYJdfg@mail.gmail.com>

The "Creating a Static Front Page" Codex entry has been on my list of pages
to edit, and I did so this morning:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_a_Static_Front_Page

I noticed that it is also flagged for "Copyedit", so please take a look and
let me know if further edits are needed. (My particular focus was
scratching a Theme-development itch with respect to proper use of Theme
template files.)

Thanks,

Chip

The Theme development area is excellent well done! Bravo!!

I also did the long procrastinated update to the top intro section and
cleaned up the instructions.

Love the specifics in the development stuff. Nice! Thanks!

Hi

A quick heads up for anyone who is around, we seem to have a glut of 
spammers on the Codex, creating fake user profile pages with mini 
biographies with spam links at the bottom, each one then creating a spam 
page or editing an existing page to introduce spam links.

Please be on the look out and either delete if you can or replace the 
page with {{rfd}} otherwise.

(I can't post to the make. site for docs, so if anyone wants to spread 
the word there, please do so.)
