Trying to understand as you aren't being very clear with what's happening
here.

First, thank you for your efforts in helping out with the documentation.
That's exciting. Now, I'm just trying to understand the issues.

I've compared the two versions
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Using_Images&diff=102898&oldid=100856

Using Images is part o the WordPress Lessons series, therefore was designed
to be a very basic instructional guide for images. It needed updating to
accommodate the Visual Editor, galleries and things, which is great, but I'm
trying to figure out how it went from that to suddenly a pretty table of
contents introduction page.

As for http://codex.wordpress.org/Inserting_Images_into_Posts_and_Pages, it
is now out in the wild rather than created first as a test page under your
username page according to the Codex Guidelines. I've put DRAFT and STUB on
there to indicate it is a draft. Please see
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines and
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Styles for more guidelines in style,
presentation, etc.

What's the goal of that page. While it is a good title, how is it really
different from what could be done on Using Images? Just curious about the
thinking of adding a new page when one would do.

As for adding images, in general, they MUST be free of copyright
infringements, not specific to any one site (we have actually made up fake
or test sites for use as examples in the past which is actually the best
idea as it doesn't show favoritism), and generally not show the entire page,
just a snippet of the example needed to make the point. Images are uploaded
to the Codex upload, not hot linked.

Can you be more specific with what other help you need? We're here to help.

Thanks again for helping us make WordPress better!

I just finished editing some pages on the Codex, and I'm very much logged
into the Codex. I clicked Extend from the top level menu bar and now it says
that I am not logged into WordPress.org.

Is this another memo I missed? Damn!

:D

Extend-Themes is on its own cookie system right now. Been working on
upgrading it for like a week. bbPress is tricky.

Plugins and ideas should be fine. Logging into Support logs you into
everything except themes and profiles. Again, working on it. :)

One of our local forum users came across this spam page and thought it
should be deleted:

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Topamax_for_seizures

Should I write here if any more pages like this come up? Or should I
edit them to remove the text (I don't have delete capability)?

Removed.

Writing here is fine, or you can replace the page text with {{rfd}} or both.

Message-ID: <e2325089da7a04c39b3dcd712a311dc8@triffid.org>

 Hi All.

 Just thought I'd say Hello before I edit any Codex articles.

 I am working on some WordPress sites at the moment.  I often find 
 mid-project that something needs updating in the Codex. One in 
 particular I've just found is this article about FeedBurner.

 http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_FeedBurner

 The instructions don't read at all well and the helpful forum link 
 silently redirects to the homepage of a newer Google groups page.

 I'm fixing up my .htaccess now for FeedBurner (I prefer to avoid 
 plugins where possible) so hopefully I'll have some insight to rewrite 
 this shortly.

 Anyway, Hello!

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex Update Drive for May 2011
Message-ID: <BANLkTincNpP1G3N=kn4NNpgTwoFPtX=Bcg@mail.gmail.com>

WordCamp Developers asked me a few months ago if there was a way to have the
WordCamp give back to WordPress by contributing to the WordPress Codex. I've
been working with them and their WordPress Meetup group volunteers and a few
behind the scenes folks to get this rocking. I'm really excited about how
this is all going to work.

We've set up a blog with for managing the effort through the month of May.
It's the WordPress Codex Documentation Things to Do List blog at
http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/.

I've put together an initial announcement about the May 5 event and month
long effort:
http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/celebrate-the-8th-birthday-of-wordpress-by-contributing-to-the-codex/

The how tos are:
http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/how-to-help-the-wordpress-codex/ and
http://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/writing-tips-for-the-wordpress-codex/

Here is what we need to do.

1. Get a list of what needs doing added to the blog with clear directions.
2. If you can participate on May 5 or during the month, we'll need your help
on the blog, in the Codex, and on the IRC (reminder it's on the FreeNode IRC
at #wordpress-docs).
3. Spread the word.

A key help will be to monitor Recent Changes to ensure that no evil slips
through and to double check additions and changes to make sure they are
right, as you all have the expertise and experience to know right from
wrong.

Thanks so much to the WordCamp Developer team for kicking us in the buns to
get the Codex updated. With all the developers attending, they really wanted
to get their participants to give back to the WordPress Community, so what
better way to do that!

I know that there has been a lot of confusion, lack of information, and
updates on the WordPress Handbooks. I've heard from Jane that she went ahead
with a new team of volunteers to create those, and it is my understanding
that the WordPress Codex articles may be used in those handbooks, but that
the Codex will continue to grow as a tips, techniques, and coverage of how
to use WordPress beyond those handbooks. We've yet to discus how exactly all
that is going to happen, and what the future holds, but this month is a
chance to really get the Codex updated as it stands and generate a lot of
new energy, and help people who want to volunteer give back and help others
to celebrate the birthday month of WordPress.

Thanks in advance for all your help, in the past, now, and future. This has
been a labor of love for a long time for many and it is much appreciated.
