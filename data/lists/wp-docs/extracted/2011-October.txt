Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress Feature Chart
Message-ID: <CAN2v4ZT3TKwVpa_6m-ZyoD5bAZDz-7u6O18X8Wpm6BUrRDqRdg@mail.gmail.com>

I thought someone had put together a comparison chart of the various
versions of WordPress on the Codex but I can't find it. With the search now
changed to include non-Codex stuff when searching the Codex, which I
understand just makes it harder to find stuff, I can't find it and I was
sure we talked about it.

In case we didn't or there isn't one, we need a feature comparison chart to
help people know what version of WordPress does what.

Here is one for Blogger and WordPress.com which highlights some features I
hadn't thought of, which would be good for showing what is available on
WordPress.com, WordPress, and WordPress MS.

http://pulsed.blogspot.com/2007/07/blogger-wordpress-chart.html - They've
kept it updated to 2011.

I think such an addition to the Codex would be important to help people
decide which version to choose.

Thanks,

Lorelle

Codex only search: codex.wordpress.org/Special:Search

I couldn't find one either, though!

Hello there, Alejandro.

As you already know, I'm one of the contributors of the Spanish codex, but
right now I'm out of time. Here is my contributor page.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Contributions/Bi0xid

Last year, after WordCamp Spain, we opened a group to make the guidelines of
the codex translations, but it has no movement right now.

You are absolutely welcome if you want to help. It would be good to
reactivate the work in spanish codex.

We can begin doing some tutorials for n00bs about how to make your
translation in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spanish-codex (or
maybe we can make a p2, it's better and it's open) and then distribute among
us the pages most needed for translation to begin.

Regards,

Subject: [wp-docs] About spanish translation of codex
Message-ID: <4E944AA9.4000308@gmail.com>

Hi, excuse me for previous message. I dont know english is THE OFFICIAL 
language on this mailing list. My apologizes.

Well, lets go again.

My name is Alejandro, my digital alter ego is erchache2000. I have a 
*little* experience admin wikis. See it on google... ;-P

I decide to help admin namespace es: of codex because I have a lot of 
free time and now im helping on spanish forum es.forums.wordpress.org.

Many times im going to codex to copy/paste links with detailed help 
about problems that people are asking there.

Now i see many problems on it.

The biggest is that 90% of titles of articles are on english, perhaps 
because es: was created making copy/paste and translate it manually. But 
this is a BAD idea because, how do you refer this article if you send a 
english link?

For example, http://codex.wordpress.org/es:Before_You_Install very 
useful for spanish user who dont speak english.

Im looking for a non destructive solution to solve it. Perhaps will be 
very difficult to change all es: structure with a bot or similar.

I dont know how many spanish users are on wiki working now.

I'm noob on this wiki and i dont know any about your wikiettiquete and 
admin chart.

Any help will be graceful accepted.

Greets.

Note that all of these pages were created before we had a unified
login system with WordPress.org. Over a year and a half ago. We
haven't had any real problems like this since switching to the unified
logins, but we haven't really cleaned up either.

I deleted all the spam results on the first 10 pages of that search.
It'll take a while for Google to notice though.

Message-ID: <CAG3vmbC+tdO70LcLHn_rxDo8Jsh8r8S=Oh1OduOJhKoWQSjOyw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello -

Is there is a firm convention for using <tt> tags or <code> tags?
Unfortunately, the documentation contradicts itself, leaving me confuzzled:

"To style code within the text of an article, such as listing
the index.php template file, use the <tt> tag to wrap the code within a
sentence. <code> tags also work, but in the past they used an annoying blue
background. Stick with <tt> to be safe." (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Styles#Using_Codes_in_the_Codex)

"There are two HTML tags which will turn text into monospaced type. They
are <code> and <tt>. The latter is rarely used today, replaced by the more
useful and semantically correct <code>, which distinguishes text that is
computer code from normal language." (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Code_in_Your_Posts#Code_Within_Paragraphs
)

Any guidance would be much appreciated.

Yours,
? JR ?

This search shows all 499 entries still in the DB:
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Special:Search&ns0=1&ns2=1&redirs=0&search=Worldwide+Shipping&limit=500&offset=0

Note that these are not "users" anymore, just old user pages. Our
concept of users in the codex changed when I integrated with
WordPress.org. These "users" cannot log into the codex, because the
codex doesn't use its own user database for authentication in that way
anymore.

This is a hard one. We started using TT within paragraphs as there were
design issues with <code> because it make it hard to read. Has this been
resolved? I'm traveling right now so if someone could do some tests, that
would be awesome and let's fix this. Permanently since <tt> is archaic. A
search and replace of the database would be necessary, or we just go forward
from here with <code> and not <tt>. Or we continue with what we have, but
I'd love to be done with it.

Message-ID: <CD47955B7E065D48AB5CF226C2ED75C0465972@tbs-sbs01.TBS.local>

Hi guys,

 

Robert Lusby & Bill Erickson have just pointed out over on WP-Hackers
that the codex page for is_archive() incorrectly lists $post_types as a
parameter.

 

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_archive

 

At present is_archive() doesn't accept any parameters.

 

To achieve the effect listed there, a user should use:

is_post_type_archive( $post_type ).

 

Could someone with Codex permissions update for us?    :)

 

Thanks,

Gavin

Everyone with a WordPress.org login can also login to the codex and edit the
page. :) ou do not need to ask special permission.

Hi all.

I am currently maintaining Croatian WordPress translation project, and I
would like to start to translate some Codex pages to Croatian language. I've
translated Codex Main page http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Yuraz/Main_Page
and I need someone to approve it and make it public, or to correct me if
I've gone wrong about this.

Thanks

Subject: [wp-docs] Network Admin: Timezone Setting
Message-ID: <CAPdLKqczPgHrcqRdPiJcaOff7-66Fid9PzhrbHGPNZaWFx783Q@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to add a clarification note to the Network Admin Codex page,
but would like some direction before doing so:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Network_Admin

Recently, while updating to 3.3-nightly, I noticed that the "last checked"
timestamp was not correct; it was displaying in (what I assumed to be) GMT.
When I searched for the appropriate network setting to change to the correct
timezone, I discovered that no such setting existed in the Network Settings.

Thanks to help from Mika and Andrea, I learned that the Network Admin
observes the timezone setting of the "main" Network site, and to change the
Network Admin timezone, one must change the timezone setting of the "main"
Network site

I figure that I'm not the only person to be confused by this behavior, and
so I would like to add an appropriate note, perhaps here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Network_Admin#Settings

Any guidance on appropriateness, location, or content - or also,
terminology? Is "main" Network site the correct term for the, erm, main
Network site?

Thanks in advance,

Chip

One more for tonight:

I've been thinking that the Template Hierarchy
diagram<http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy#Visual_Overview>could
do with a bit of an update, so I've been working on one:
http://www.chipbennett.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/WordPressTemplateHierarchy.rev3_.png

Any comments? Also, what is the correct approach to updating the Codex page?
That page is highly referenced, so I don't want to screw anything up. :)

Thanks,

Chip

Codex pages are very easy to revert so it's less a hassle than you'd think.

If it's a massive rewrite, I'd suggest doing it as a subpage off your user page, and share it here. If it's just cleanup and a new image, though... Go forth and fix.

The new template looks ... Busy. It's almost at the 'too much information to be usable' stage and may need to be two images.  One a corrected/updated version of what we have, and the other done with what you have as a 'detailed' view option?  I know I don't always need the full details, just a cheat sheet.

Could use a lot of terms, don't think there is an official one. "Root"
site. "Main" site. "First" site. Etc.

If you just want to update that particular file with a new version,
you'd do that here:

http://codex.wordpress.org/File:Template_Hierarchy.png

Notice the "Upload a new version of this file" link.

Also notice how all old versions remain as well. Reverting it isn't a
problem if needed.

At this point, all I want to do is update the diagram. I don't see any
glaring issues with the page text. :)

As for "too busy": I could certainly make a version without the conditional
tags and body_class CSS classes, which would cut down on the busy-ness.

Thanks,

Chip

Then, as Otto said, upload a new version ;)

Yeah, I think without the css classes would be better. The conditional tags are kind of there already.  And you get extra cookies for no white-text/black-BG.  My eyes thank you!

The My Sites dashboard screen refers to the "Primary Site"; we also use Primary in the Help Tabs.
