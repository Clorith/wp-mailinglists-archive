Any chance of the search that's at the forums being used at the codex?  An
example search recently was for author template.  Codex didn't return the
page /Author_Templates in the first page of search, but the forum search
did.  It's kinda a useless search, at the codex, IMO.

Hey, Michael,

I've been complaining about the search function for ages. If I'm not 
being listened to about this, maybe you will be. Email Matt at 
m@mullenweg.com and tell him exactly what you think, and give him very 
explicit tips on how it should work. It's handled now by Yahoo, which is 
an improvement, but still not good. The more specific your complaint is, 
the more likely he will respond. From me, it's an broken record.

Thanks! Your help is really appreciated.

Hello Lorelle,

I'm not sure I follow you. What is it about the WP Docs search you dislike?

I can't speak for Lorelle, but the codex searches ALL of the wiki code/text
when searching  for  a  relavant  term,  which  returns  many false
positives.  My example is a good one.  Search the codex for Author Template,
then use the search at wordpress.org for the same term.  Compare results.

I can not believe it would be too difficult to replace the search feature at
the codex with the same search from wordpress.org.  Might even lessen the
forum questions on some of the common topics, if a genuinely relavant codex
page was returned.

As was just complained about, the search feature on the Codex does not 
return appropriate results. The new feature of restricting search 
results to documentation or forums is brilliant and very welcome. I 
continue to hear complaints about the search results. It would be lovely 
to have this cleaned up.

Results continue to include user pages, talk pages, and pages which do 
not meet the needs of the searcher. We've asked repeatedly to have pages 
labeled "user:", "codex:" and "talk:" be removed from public search 
results. I just did a search for "header art", a commonly searched 
phrase, and on the first page of the search results I found the first 
article as a good search result, leading to the WordPress lesson on 
header art, then at the bottom of the list a result for the article on 
the archiecture of 1.5 Themes. The rest of the 8 links were to User, 
Talk or Codex pages, completely useless references. Hey, 2 out of 10 
ain't bad, but it isn't helpful.

If there was a way to restrict the user, codex, and talk pages to only 
those logged in, the WordPress world would be a smiley, happy face for 
many WordPress volunteers. For the users, the Codex would be really a 
viable manual, helping them find the information they are looking for.

Hi all,

As I whish to learn how to build th?mes for WordPress, I thought that it 
could be a good idea to translate them in my language (French) in the 
mean time.
So I have started and I have a few new pages.
I have done them trying to understand the way what is existing has been 
done.
I understood that French translation was starting by FR: and the name 
seemed to be translated. So I have done my new pages this way :
1) Change/Add the link FR:Translatin_of_the_title and save the page.
2) Click on the new link to edit the empty page and paste the english 
version of its contain and save
3) Edit the page and start translating.

Well I hope I don't do any mistake, I have tried to read advices about 
how to proceed but I am a little bit confused whit all what I have to read.

Now I am wondering how to manage cross references and be shure to don't 
give an other name to the same page.
I am thinking that the best way wloud be to just add FR: without 
translating the name of the page.
But it is not the way I have started...

So I have 2 questions :
Is there some naming conventions for the pages when translating ?
If I have some pages to rename how to proceed ?

Thanks in advance,
Jpaul

fr:Utilisation des Themes is a good example of a page that has been
translated to French.    As an example, Theme Development might translate to
http://codex.wordpress.org/fr:Developpement_de_Theme

> If I have some pages to rename how to proceed ?
If you are taking an English page and translating to French, it's not
necessary to rename pages.  Just copy the wiki-text into your new article
(type the new article name in your brower's address bar, then edit the
page).

Yes, it is not necessary to create an empty link in order to create a page.
Furthermore, I'd like to add the since translation might take more
than one, err, take, you'd probably be better advised to start it in
your own space. I myself have translated a few pages in French, and
some work in progress is only accessibly from my own page :
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:XiBe
like
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:XiBe/Autoriser_l%27envoi_des_r%C3%A9f%C3%A9rants
(which I should really wrap up).

Once the translation is complete, copy/paste it in the public space.

Well, first of all thanks for your answers.

Sorry but I still have some questions.

1) About working in my own space :
I am afraid doing it this way, that someone else could do the same 
translation on his side in the same time. So one of our works will be 
useless.
This is reason why I do it on the online version : doing it this way, 
others know that the translation is in progress and also he can help on 
the same version of the text.
But if it's a problem to have many changes on an online page I will do 
it on my own space. Any solution could be to build a new page with the 
link to the one on my own space (so every body is advised taht the 
translation is in progress). And update the final page when the 
translation is finished. The question is : is it possible, for someone 
else, to modify a page stored in my own space ?

2) concerning the name of the pages :
Yes, fr:Utilisation des Themes is, a good exemple (it's me who do  that 
draft of translation ;) ). But it is a very good exemple also because 
this link appears  in many pages. And I don't know when some of them 
will be translated. I imagine that sometime I can found the link 'Using 
Themes' and don't remember that it is already translated. Instead of 
'Utilisation des th?mes' I may translate it as 'Utiliser les th?mes'. So 
there is a risk to have two pages :
fr:Utilisation des Themes
fr:Utiliser les Themes
Whith approximatively the same contain.
And even if I remember that it is already translated I have to remember 
the name of the page or look for it to change the link.

This is the resaon why I am thinking about just adding fr: and keep the 
same name. For exemple :
[[FR:Using_Themes|Utilisation des th?mes]]
and
[[FR:Using_Themes|Utiliser les th?mes]]
Will match the same page...

So after my short experience I discover those reasons and I think I will 
just add FR: in front of the links but for that I need to rename
FR:Utilisation des Themes
as
FR:Using_Themes

So any advice ?

Thanks in advance
PS : Sorry for my poor english (I read technical english but don't write 
it very often)
