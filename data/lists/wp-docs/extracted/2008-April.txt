Subject: [wp-docs] New to the list - 2.5 Changes
Message-ID: <269DC544-ECBF-466F-B195-81CA7E345BF5@simmons.edu>

Hi there,

I'm new to this list and am not really sure about what the  
appropriate protocol for editing things is. For example, I'm noticing  
since WP 2.5 is out now, that a lot of pages reference Administration  
Panels > Options. In WordPress 2.5 this is now Administration Panels  
 > Settings.

Should this be changed? Should there be some note about how it is  
different in the two versions?

Thanks in advance,
Alissa

Any work in this arena is greatly appreciated.  Easiest way to do that might 
be to see what links to a given panel, say the Reading_Options_SubPanel [1], 
then fix the articles. Below [2] are the 'wikid' links to the relative 
'Settings' article that you can copy and paste into articles referencing the 
old Options.

Not too sure this is necessary.  Besides it's just a chore making sure the 
articles reflect the 'current how it works' let alone how it changed from 
previous versions.


Thanks for asking and for your interest!!!

I'm wondering whether this page needs a big deprecated header (do we
have a template for that?)

FYI - Seeing it referred to in #wordpress as a question answer is what
started my thought process

What do you guys think?

Message-ID: <80dd5f5d0804020931t561cc12bp66c77b3ccd04d01e@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on a new codex page for the function get_post_custom().
According to the guidelines I think I'm supposed to post that here so people
know what's up.

Also, if anyone has any suggestions about the steps I should take to get
this thing out there, I would appreciate it. This is my first page in the
codex, and I want to make sure I go through the proper channels and don't
step on any toes. I have already looked through most of what I could find on
"Writing pages," "being a codex n00b," etc. (and I am currently publishing
the draft as a sub-page of my user page, as per the instructions)

Thanks for any input!

-Steve

Ps. After this I hope to tackle get_post_custom_keys() and
get_post_custom_values()

I'm all for some sort of bold note so that users know. This one is a little
personal for me as I worked for a while on a plugin and couldn't figure out
why it wasn't working... only to discover that wordpress hadn't used
user_level in a long time.

I say go for it.

Hans Engel [1] created several templates including Oldpage [1] that you 
might use.

Steve,

Just drop a note on my User Talk Page [1] when you are done and I will move 
it into the Main namespace.  I'll use a move to retain the 'history' on the 
doc.

>From the looks of it [2] you already got the hang of things.

There's a spelling error at the bottom.  In the "post_id" section you 
have "fileds" instead of "fields".

Does anyone mind if I move the other two pages [1][2] to Function Reference
myself? It seems like a pretty simple task and I feel like my initial
efforts on these pages have already been approved.

Again, I want to go through the proper channels, with no toe-stepping,
etc... so let me know if I'm out of line.

Go for it.  You are now an accomplished Codex volunteer.  Publish into the 
main namespace at will and often and fast ;)

Thanks for the contributions.

The discussion page for function reference still redirects to the discussion
page for "Function Reference 2.0.x". I'm assuming this was an oversight from
when the main function reference page was moved so that another one could be
started. Should this be fixed, or is it actually on purpose?

-Steve

Ps. I have the day off work, so sorry if I'm a little too energetic about
all this. It's all pretty exciting to me.

I sent this a while ago and it never posted, so I'm trying again... forgive
me if it posts twice
------------------------------------------

I've noticed that on the function reference page, some of the links are
surrounded by <tt> tags, and some are not. Which way should this be?

I think the links should not have the <tt> tags around them because (at
least in the default theme) it's hard to tell the difference between a link
and non-link. When a link is not surrounded by those tags, it becomes more
bold, and stands out from the rest saying "Click on me! I have more
information!"

Just my 2 cents anyways. Anyone else have thoughts on this?

Steve,

I'd say a wrap any reference that doesn't have a corresponding article in 
<tt> </tt>

Guess this is the best guideline:

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex formatting issue
Message-ID: <47F53C0B.6090803@poplarware.com>

The current Codex has a formatting problem. I'm not sure who is in 
charge of the formatting, but the page titles are repeating 
horizontally and it looks terrible. The issue is that the title is 
coming out like this in the HTML:

<h2 class="fancy" style="background-image: 
url(http://s.wordpress.org/style/v3-head/function_reference/add_meta_box.png);">Function 
Reference/add meta box</h2>

This in-line style with a background image has the image repeating 
both in X and Y. The image is 500x24, and it is repeating in a space 
that (on my current Firefox 2.x browser) is 1084x27, so I get 2.5 
horizontal images and 1 and a little bit more of vertical ones. It 
looks terrible, overlaps the left sidebar header, and shouldn't be 
repeating at all.  I'd send a screen shot of what it is looking like 
on my Firefox browser, but I'm running out the door... can someone fix 
this?

I kinda have the opposite problem. With the Codex skin, it seems to cut off
the ends of the longer titles like here [1]. I can't seem to reproduce what
she's getting, and I too am using the current firefox (2.0.0.13). Anyone
else notice either of these?

The issue seems to have been fixed, but I'm guessing it was only happening
because of the switchover to the new design, still yet to come. I guess we
just have to be patient :)

Subject: [wp-docs] Proposing a new template
Message-ID: <80dd5f5d0804110948w392480la0b1d3ecd6a2727e@mail.gmail.com>

As I have been adding pages, one thing has been annoying me. Since I want
someone with more experience than me to review my pages, I leave them
labeled as copyedit. However, this puts them in with the 96 other copyedit
pages, many of which are not complete, or require a lot of work.

I propose a new template called (perhaps) "Needs review" (I have an example
at [1]). The idea would be that the author is convinced that the page is
finished, and needs no further editing. He/she then labels it as "Needs
Review" so that an admin, or someone who is very knowledgeable about the
subject of that page, can quickly read through it and remove the tag.

The purpose of this would be to have a separate category for pages that
probably don't need any changes made, they just need to be looked over. That
would make it much easier for someone with a few minutes to spare to find a
page that simply needs review. And maybe there could be a number associated
with the template (much like the version number in {{old page}}) that would
depict how many people had reviewed it since the last change. If someone has
to fix something (other than a simply misspelling), then the number would be
reset to 0 (by the user who fixed it). Then once the number reached 3 or 5
or something, the person who reviewed it would simply delete the tag.

Any thoughts? I welcome the feedback.

It's in the http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Creating_a_New_Page Codex
Guidelines:

3. *Add The Following:* At the top of the empty page, before you enter your
text, please type the following:
{{Draft}}
When you save or preview the page, the following *warning* will appear to
warn people who find this article on a search engine that it is a rough
draft and subject to correction and change....At the bottom of your new
page, please add: [[Category:New_page_created]]
This will create a "flag" that will let people know that this is a new page
requiring editing. These two elements provide information to users and
volunteers, so when you visit the "what can you
do"<http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Contributing_to_Codex>page, the
links there will make your page pop up on the lists as articles
needing work. Thanks for your efforts and we'll be watching and fixing, but
there is a lot going on right now, so don't be impatient. The Codex is
always a work in process.

On SVN (the software used to track bugs, file bugs, file patch and so
on in WordPress) you can give your reports differents "tags", and
amongst them "has-patch", "needs-feedback" and "2nd-opinion"

As I understand it, Steve's proposal is to create something similar.
Stubs and Copyedits have their roles, but as I see it, there's a wide
margin between "this is a stub" and "this looks quite decent to me but
maybe some guru will fix a thing or two". I for one would like such a
tag in the Codex :)

Not sure about the tag thing with MediaWiki, but there is the Category 
structure.  So just put [[Category|Needs Review]] on such articles.
Then just browse to [1] to see the articles needing peer review.

That avoids another template that reportedly upsets our beloved readers, and 
still gives a quick way to access those articles.

The "new page created" is a clue to Codex volunteers to jump on that
page...well, once they've let the docs mailing list know it's ready for
attack, which you should do.

We've had problems with people jumping as soon as they see any clue that the
page is ready for attacking. That's why we instituted the "contact the docs
mailing list" as an additional method of saying, "Go. Hack away!"

I have been working on adding a meta box in a plugin of mine, and I decided
to update the page on codex [1], but the example I added seems a little
sketchy to me. If someone who has more experience with hooks (or even
better: experience with add_meta_box) could take a look at it, to see if
there would be a better way to do it, I would greatly appreciate it.

Hey Steve,

Thanks for working on function docs! I will check this out, as I've at 
least once used add_meta_box in a plugin. But it will have to wait 
until tomorrow, when my brain is working again.

By the way, I think there is another Codex page that mentions 
add_meta_box briefly and has an example, maybe the "Migrating Plugins 
and Themes" page? But my brain is failing due to a long day of Perl 
programming and meetings...

Anyway, I'll check this out tomorrow...

Regards,
     Jennifer

Steve, it all looks good, except for a few little inconsistencies in
presentation. I'll clean those up but what is desperately needed are real
life examples, much as used in the template tags. Can you or others pitching
in on this provide one to three real life examples on how and why you would
use this function.

For example, why would use use the delete_post_meta. We don't need articles,
just a line or two example, such as:

To remove all post meta data references to "Mood" as "Sad", ....blah blah
code.

This makes sense if we have some meta data we want gone, and gives us a real
code example to remove that reference.

We want people to glance at the examples and have light bulbs of coherent
recognition of application go off in their heads. :D

Thanks!

Message-ID: <fded39850804161715k65549bd0rcceebcd1c0bfd7a4@mail.gmail.com>

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/ is a mess.

The Function Reference should match, in look and style, the Template Tags
page. The Template Tags master directory page is set up with the template
tags listed under each "category" of use. So the Function Reference page
started out.

People have now been attempting to add a "definition" of the functions into
the list and it looks horrible.

If we recreate the list to display functions and definition, it must be
consistent and available for EVERY function - and then the same technique
applied to the Template Tags page.

So the question is, do we stick to the format set in the  Template Tags or
redefine both with function/tag and definitions (a two column layout for
every section)?

My vote is for getting rid of the short definitions, as users can find those
out by clicking on the link and reading the first line or two in the
description. Many of the function names are somewhat self-explanatory
anyways.

I would agree that the page looks horrible.
All the info is crammed together & definitions are sparse.
I think that it would be a great idea to add a two column layout w/ 
definition, or maybe even a one column layout like php.net does: 
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php

Another thing that came to mind while looking at the Function Reference 
page, was that some functions have braces which contain the accepted 
parameters. This is also inconsistent. Some functions even have the type 
of parameter see: 'wp_update_post( $postarr=array() )'...

And added note: Might it be useful to include a link to a function cross 
reference on this page for advanced users?

I don't know the policies to well as I am new to this list - Just wanted 
to throw in my opinions.

My name is Mike by the way.

And I love WordPress!!!

And am willing to help out.

-Mike

Is there a way to define the title of a link in wiki formatting? It would be
nice if we could add a short description into the title of the link so a
user can hover over a function name to see what it does.

I think you can put in the a href="" title="" tags directly instead of 
using Wiki formatting. Here's the help page on link Wiki stuff:

With Jennifer's clean up and my final tweaks, I'd say the matter was decided
on how the Functions Reference page should look. Thanks everyone for their
input!

Now, if we could just do violence on whoever decided to make links bold in
the Codex, a poor web practice, and clean up the rest of the CSS woes, we'd
be in better shape. :D

Actually, for the function reference page, I tended to prefer the bold
links. It made a clear difference between functions that had documentation,
and functions that did not. Of course, I'm sure our goal is for all of the
functions on that page to be links, making this a moot point.

I added a page to the Codex titled "WordPress Quick Start Guide." On this
page, I tried to provide a quick explanation of all the essential tasks and
concepts that people learning WordPress need to know.

If anyone wants to give me feedback or wants to make edits to improve it,
I'd appreciate it. Thanks.

Here's the page: http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide

I put it under Main Page > WordPress for Beginners > WordPress Quick Start
Guide.

The article is very good and covers some points really well. I like the
general flow.

However, this duplicates articles already in the Codex. I like the idea of a
Quick Start Guide, but it needs to be that: a quick reference guide.

Following the Codex guidelines is critical, and there are some things that
need to be fixed in accordance with those guidelines. Please review them and
correct the article accordingly.

Primarily, the article needs to get to the point fast, keeping
point-by-point steps short and sweet. There is a lot of editorial content,
which is fine for explaining WordPress to a non-WordPress audience, but by
the time people get to the Codex, they have already made some decisions and
have information including the decision to go self-hosted or not. They are
on the WordPress Codex, so they do not need to be told that the Codex is a a
wiki manual. :D

By calling it a Quick Start Guide, it needs to be QUICK. Step by step and
point by point. We have a variety of articles that take users through the
process with more explanations, and this article duplicates much of that
work. I'd link to those as a lead in for more information and get right to
the quick in the start part.

I recommend that the article be shortened to the key points so someone can
go through and check off the list of each of the steps. Also, until we can
get the designer to remove the third, unnecessary sidebar, the table of
contents squishes everything over, so please keep the section titles short.

It's a great start and I look forward to watching it evolve into a valuable
addition to the Codex. I'll let you whack away at it first before we send
the troops in. :D Good work and thank you so much!

Thanks Lorelle. I appreciate the feedback. I agree with you about the need
for it to be quicker and shorter. The audience I had in mind actually is a
non-WordPress audience -- people totally new to WordPress. I'll work on
shortening it and let you know when I have a revised version.

One thing you can do (not having actually looked at the page, this may 
or may not be appropriate) is link to the articles that contain the 
duplicated information you are removing. E.g. "First step: Install 
WordPress -- see blah blah blah for more information" rather than 
going through the installation process in detail.

Just a thought...
