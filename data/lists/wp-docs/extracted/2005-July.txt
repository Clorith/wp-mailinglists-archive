Hi folks,

I've signed up on the Codex Tasks page for "Changing <code> to <tt>". I 
will also be looking at recent changes and checking for spelling and 
grammar mistakes.

My ID on the wiki is BruceWebber

Why would we change code to tt?

Just read the tasklist - can we not muck around with the stylesheet
instead? It's not particularly semantic and could cause problems
further down the line.

Matt, the Codex has had a list of things to do for a couple of months 
now at http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks.  On the list is a task 
about changing the tags for all references to <code> to <tt>.

Reasons:

1. I was told a request was made to you a long time ago about changing 
the CSS for <code> to have no blue background.  Nothing happened. I was 
told that the decision was to change the <code> to <tt> in order to 
remove the blue background when using code within a paragraph. This 
could, at any time, be easily replaced with a SQL update if the decision 
needed to be changed.

2. We found MANY instances of bad "code" layouts. People combining 
<pre><code></pre></code> or just using <pre> and <code> together, so 
assigning this simple task not only helped volunteers clean up the usage 
of <code> it also helped to clean up irregular use of tags and code 
structures in general. This helps to create a very solid and consistent 
structure for usage, and cleans up the MANY validation errors found 
throughout the Codex.

3. Most importantly, this was a minor task that invited beginners to 
"get into the Codex". A lot of the complaints we had were that the 
interface was scary, changing the wording was nervy, and "intimidation". 
By giving volunteers simple, easy to do but specific tasks, they could 
get over their fears slowly, learn how this all works, build up their 
confidence, and basically get "hooked". As Carthik has been often known 
to tell new volunteers on the Codex, once you get started, it becomes an 
addicition. We needed to find some hooks to generate that addicition. ;-)

That's the reason.  It went on the list because I was told to put it 
here a long time ago.  Now we have people who are helping, addicted, and 
the Codex is looking better and more consistent than ever.

What's the matter with the blue background? <code> is a more semantic 
tag than <tt> if it is used for code and should be used, if <code> is 
poetry at least. ;)

<pre><code> is perfectly valid for blocks of code.

I think that's great to have easy tasks like this, but I think in this 
particular instance the task is harmful.

Matt:

Well, with Carthik gone for the next six weeks, can I make the request 
an official one?

Please change the CSS so that the use of the tag <code> will NOT have 
the blue background. It makes it difficult to read and clutters up the 
whole look of the pages. The Codex Volunteers have worked very hard to 
keep these pages not looking "wiki-like" but clean and professional.

Since the change has been made on something like 90%+ of the pages, 
please do a MySQL UPDATE to search and replace the incidences of <tt> 
and </tt> with <code> and </code>.  I have found nothing to indicate 
that the TeleType or <tt> is deprecated, so it is still viable for use 
within paragraphs.

While <pre><code> may be okay in your book, it is redundant and nothing 
validates with <pre><code>blah blah</pre></code> and that is what is 
finally being cleaned up by close attention by the volunteers working on 
general uses of code.

There are also consistent validation errors in the sidebar with a class 
ID being used twice in the sidebar |<div class="portlet" id="*p*-tb"> 
and in the ads. We may not be able to help the advertisers lazy ways, 
but we need to fix our own.

While in the Codex CSS, would you please also add a class for the FAQs 
TOCs. By default, all TOCs float to the right and in this particulat 
case, we need them to NOT float and sit on the left margin. This class 
may serve useful with a few other page structures begin considered for 
the future.

These and others are on your Codex To Do list, per your request at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/codex_todo, as a reminder.

There is also a lot of requests on the 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:State_of_Codex page which is now being 
reviewed and added to by the documentation team.

Thanks,

Lorelle

I created the following template page on the Codex:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Template:CurrentVersion

I did this so that our upgrade instructions can say things like:
"To upgrade to {{Template:CurrentVersion}}, blah blah blah"

I looked (briefly) and couldn't find any such template.  This should
make our upgrade docs a little more "timeless", I hope.  When 1.6 is
released (or Allah forbid a 1.5.1.4!), we can simply update that template.

To bring everyone up to date on this issue, it was suggested by Matt 
during this week's WordPress Meetup that the Codex begin plans to 
include "screencasts". For those new to this concept, it is like a 
"podcast" but basically an animated/video-like display of screen shots. 
An example would be installing WordPress. A link to the screencast would 
be on the Installing WordPress Codex article page, giving users a chance 
to read through the documentation and/or view the animated process of 
how to install WordPress.

I've set up a page on the Codex to take notes on how this may work and 
provide links to examples and other things and open this up to 
discussion here, and in that page's discussion page.

We will need someone to coordinate this with the Codex.  I've talked to 
a couple people about this and I'm awaiting their answer. We will also 
need volunteers to take on the fun of making such screencasts.  There 
are a lot of decisions and information to gather, like which articles 
would best be suited to this, decisions about software, and how to 
coordinate this effort.

It's very exciting.  Let's start making plans and begin to put this into 
effect. See: http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Screencasts for more 
information and to sign up.

Hi,
I have a copy of macromedia Captivate, and I can use that to do some 
videos, screencasts, of WP installation, configuration, etc.

I believe you'll need to change MediaWiki settings if you're going to upload
screencast files (e.g. SWF) to Codex.

I've spent a little time lately going through the Drupal Handbooks 
examining how they do their documents layout.  I think we all need to 
review a lot of other online manuals to keep a good perspective on what 
the Codex has to offer. Remember, we are "promoting" the Codex as an 
"online manual" not a wiki, and this raises the bar on quality.

The breadcrumb system that connects the categorized documents at the top 
of the articles are nice, as are the clear changable menus on the left 
of the articles. The idea of adding a PayPal or other form asking for 
donations is also nice and something worth considering for the Codex. 
Cheaper than buying the book. ;-)

The new addition of categories to the Codex begins the process of 
connecting "breadcrumb" like navigation.

While some of the documentation is simple and clear, the usage of the 
handbooks as a forum for dialog with comments within the documentation 
adds clutter and opinions rather than facts.  I found that confusing and 
tedious to read through.  People would tell their stories and make 
excuses before getting to the point. The Codex works hard on eliminating 
the "stories" and getting readers to the point as fast as possible, 
keeping the manual feeling through much of the documentation. I think we 
should stay on track with that.

I really like the blue tones against the white page but the two sidebar 
add a lot of clutter. Viewed at 800x600, this page is a cluttered mass 
and difficult to read. Even with my new 19" monitor at a high 
resolution, the page still feels cluttered.  I think adding colors and 
navigation boxes to the Codex in the future is good, but I seriously 
recommen that we keep to a one sidebar look with the majority of 
emphasis on the content not the clutter.

I think we should start a discussion about how different online manuals 
look and work and begin to collect information and opinions on how to 
improve the Codex. We now have a good body of work, but there are still 
HUGE gaps in the documentation.  Per request from Matt and Carthik, I 
put together a "comparison" of one blogging software's table of contents 
against the Codex, which helped to generate a lot of the articles on the 
Codex:Tasks list and this needs to be worked on some more: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_Wanted

I also want to be clear, and speaking a little on behave of Carthik, 
that we need to continue the emphasis on the content, and slowly work on 
changing the look of the Codex. I think the best and possibly fastest 
change to the Codex would be replacing the sunflower with a WordPress 
logo of which there are some neat examples in the Codex Image Library 
that would work temporarily, and making the CSS changes requested last 
week of Matt.

What say you?

The FreeBSD handbook is one of the best online documentation efforts I
have seen.
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html

It is chronological and thorough.

I have to agree with Virgil.

The general (implicit) expectation for a manual - based on our
previous experiences - is a _linear_ outline. Even more so because our
general thinking pattern also follows this linear model. (Allegedly
since the Ancient Greeks the Western world went along this pattern...)
It has to have to go from a starting point (straight) toward the end
point:
start | ---> | ---> | ---> | end
The problem with the wiki format is that is absolutely contrary to
this expectation with its "bush-like" structure: from the main page
you can go everywhere following different branches but you never know
where you are!
I am pretty familiar with the wiki and especially the Codex; I use it
a lot for myself and also while helping in the forum. However if I
don't have an article bookmarked or I don't know its exact location, I
have frustrating difficulties to find and locate it... I can only
imagine how difficult it could be for someone browsing the Codex for
the first time.

Yes, yes, I know a lot of effort was put into making it more
organized, more structured, and I really appreciate all that work! (I
am not really known for my polite niceties, so take it as a genuine
compliment :)

The content of the Codex is a fantastic resource (except my
contributions ;). Too bad its structure doesn't even come close to the
quality of the content. I am aware it will not be changed any soon,
still I had to get this off my chest... <sigh>

This is a concern I expressed from the start.
What I would like to see is the sidebar space used for some decent 
navigation. Right now it's a blank space - and given the non-intuitive 
nature of the wiki, I think it is wasted. It should be used.

Subject: [wp-docs] Evacuating from Hurricane
Message-ID: <42CDA620.50002@cameraontheroad.com>

It is looking more and more like I will be heading out of Mobile, 
Alabama, by Saturday (give or take) to get away from Hurricane Dennis. 
It is currently just turning into a Category 3 Hurricane and the odds 
are that it will get bigger and meaner when it gets out over open water 
again.

I've talked to several people about covering the Codex while I'm gone 
and offline, checking for vandals and other tasks. I just wanted to 
inform everyone.

So far, this is proving to be a record hurricane year with more "named" 
storms in the first month of hurricane season than before. It is likely 
that this will not be the first one I run from. I know we also have a 
lot of volunteers along the Gulf Coast and in Florida, not to mention 
there are plenty along the Eastern Seaboard who also suffer from the 
hurricanes and their side effects as they pass through. Let's try to 
work together to cover each other during these times, as well as during 
summer vacations and such, so that the work continues forward, even if 
the people are offline for a bit.

Thanks for your support and if plans change, I'll let you know.

What format are these usually available in? Is SWF typical? I'd hate
to think they would be in some MS-only or MAC-specific format.

I think they'd make them available in SWF (Shockwave Flash) which is 
playable as long as the user has the Flash plugin installed for their 
browser. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the Screencast apps let 
you save as SWF.

Most of the ones I've seen have been quicktime files, though the latest 
have been Flash. I don't know of a video equivilent to MP3 that works 
everywhere flawlessly, or an OS equivilent like OGG. This is why 
standards are good. :)

Ogg Theora.  GNOME is thinking about integrating a desktop session
recorder that saves as Theora into its screen capture facility.  Prt Scr
and make a movie.  Of course, most Windows and Mac users don't have
Theora handy.  It is available to them, however.

To provide some context, currently 75% of people visiting wordpress.org 
are on Windows, 16% on Mac, and about 8% Linux/FreeBSD/etc. Following 
the 80/20 rule, and realizing that the Windows/Mac users are probably 
less savvy than our Linux audience, we should probably use a format that 
is most widely available on those two platforms.

On Cnet the videos are made with Macromedia Flash ... its a lot of work !!!

But on Wink you dont need to have or to know anything about flash tecnology
... Wink made this for you ... it isnt so gorgeous but for tutos of
instalations and aplications is just fine ! ...

Just click for start capture and click another time to stop ... you can edit
puting ballons texts, butons and images mixing all at the final ... Wink
create 2 files: HTML + SWF .. the HTML is only for call the SWF file ....
thats it.

I think that Wink is propably good enough for most of people who don't
have expensive software like Macromedia Captivate. I haven't tested Wink
myself yet but it's propably one of the best software for this type of
requirements (free, easy(?) to use, SWF export).


Wink: http://www.debugmode.com/wink/
Macromedia Captivate: http://www.macromedia.com/software/captivate/

There are also links to some another software in Codex:

Subject: [wp-docs] Building the french section
Message-ID: <9e4ae73e050709112773c73acd@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening. I'm new here.

I'm Xavier Borderie, and am in charge of the French translation of WP.
I run a freely accessible test-blog for all to see and give opinions :
http://xavier.borderie.net/wp-fr/

I also run my own blog not far away :
http://xavier.borderie.net/blog/
In dire need of a personnal template, yep.

Seeing that WP is getting some traction around here these past weeks,
and that a stub of French Main Page has been added by morganiq et
Serger Keller, I launch a call for participation on the wp-fr blog :
http://xavier.borderie.net/wp-fr/2005/07/08/appel-a-participation/

Not much has happenned since then, so I decided to start scratching
that itch mysql (guess I can be impatient sometimes) : I translated
the Contributing page.
http://codex.wordpress.org/fr:Codex:Contribuer
Those who'll browse through will notice the high number of (en
anglais) mentions. Guess I'll need to create a specific Task List for
the French section.

I'm only getting started, and doubt I'll be able to, on my own,
translate even the most useful pages, but little by little, I'll make
my way through some.
Which, by the way, leads me to congratulations for the work everyone
has done to the Codex.

Cheers.

Was poking around recently and just discovered the site www.lulu.com,
and wondered if there had already been any discussion of taking the
most pertinent info from the codex and making a printed version
available.  Doesn't seem there would be any out of pocket expenses,
and might be something the new blogger might want to possess, not to
mention, even the dedicated user to have around as reference as well.
I'm actually assuming it's already been discussed, but being new to
the mail list, thought I'd ask.

This has been discussed and presently, there isn't enough information, 
and enough of the "right" information in the Codex to qualify for "book" 
status.

There is also a lot that must be clarified for copyright protection and 
contribution acknowledgements as well as editorial staff.....this is not 
something taken lightly and as it stands, WordPress is undergoing 
dramatic changes with the next version due to be released in the next 
few months and anything that happens book wise now would be obsolete 
then. Maybe with the new release, if we can get enough documentation 
holes filled and enough volunteers contribute articles related to the 
new version.

It would be _great_ if we could have available complete documentation 
for the next version at the time of release.  I know this will be wildly 
challenging.  I'll help liason between hacker developments and 
documentation gaps, if necessary.

I had written a beautiful reply and then my laptop crashed.  Boy, we're 
really getting going with preparation for the upcoming WordPress Backup 
Week!

So, in short, per a request from Matt, please check 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_Wanted. This is a table 
of contents for the online manual of a competitor. We used it to start 
to generate a reference guide for holes in the documentation. Please 
review it, link a document that covers the topic next to the topic 
title, and check and mark which of these have been already added to the 
Task List. If you find a topic that deserves an article, please mark it 
as for the TASK LIST (Codex:Tasks) and add it to the task list.  If you 
see gaps in the documentation where articles need to be added to match 
WordPress features and functions, add it.

I've started a tentative "index/master table of contents" at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/TOC but it is missing a lot of 
new documentation.  I've asked MichaelH to review it and add more 
documents to the list and I'm asking all of you to review it and think 
about what holes there are in the documentation. Then add them to the 
Articles Wanted and Task List.

In order to offer any form of "book", be it in pdf form or otherwise, we 
have to fill in the blanks.  Here are some of the biggest holes in the 
documentation as I see them:

* WordPress as a CMS (dealing with e-commerce, mailing lists, 
subscribers, link checking, stats monitoring and other related CMS topics)
* Developers Documentation - we need more docs on functions, database 
manipulation and information, and more advanced user topics.
* Advanced User Topics: If you have been paying attention, while the 
forum continues to get beginner questions, many people are discovering 
the Codex to answer the really simple stuff other than "my install is 
borked". The majority of the questions are about queries, feeds, and 
more sophisticated topics, topics in demand by the advanced user. Go 
through the forums and find the consistently requested ADVANCED topics 
and let's make a list to add these to the documentation.

And one more thing, and this is really important so I hope you are all 
paying attention.

Until very recently, the majority of documents added to the Codex were 
written 1) for fun (hey, I have an idea and want to share it), and 2) as 
part of a DYI project (I solved it and here is my solution).  We now 
need YOU, the documentation team volunteers, to 1) start writing because 
the work must be written, and 2) recruit others to help write the 
documentation that needs to be written.

To fill in these gaps, we have to write because the need is there, not 
because we "want" to. That means we need a list of what needs to be 
written, and we need people to take on these assignments. I'm not ready 
to start recommending deadlines, but expect it to come soon, especially 
as it gets closer to the release of 1.6. I'll cover that in another 
thread, but if we, as a team, want to provide quality information, take 
the pressure off the forums as the sole source of official WordPress 
help, and share the support burden, we need to write for purpose, not 
just for fun.

Oh, don't worry. We'll make it fun, after all this is volunteer work, 
but let's focus on the tasks that need to be done and do them well.

No, we currently do not have an article about "turning on" popup 
comments. I thought there was one on the Task List, but I see there 
isn't. We need to add it to the task list and we need such an article.

Resource information related to this is found in the template tags 
dealing with the popups, 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Site_Architecture_1.5 and random other 
places, but no specifics.  Good catch!

Press Release

Backing Up is Not Just for Cars

Your WordPress database contains every post, every comment and every 
link you have on your blog. If your database gets erased or corrupted, 
you stand to lose everything you have written. There are many reasons 
why this could happen and not all are things you can control. But what 
you can do is <b>backup your data<b>. After all, it is important isn't it?

<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups">WordPress Backup 
Week July 23-30</a> aims to help you become more familiar with the 
process of backing up and protecting your data.

Step-by-step backup instructions will be available in the online manual, 
the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org">WordPress Codex</a>, and 
support provided online in the <a 
href="http://www.wordpress.org/support">WordPress Support Forum</a> to 
help you through the process.

Guides will be available to help you backup your WordPress site and 
database for a variety of systems and server software such as 
<b>cPanel<b>, <b>DirectAdmin<b>, <b>Plesk<b> and <b>vDeck<b>. Consider 
using this Backup Week as an incentive to backup all your valuable 
documents and software, too.

These guides will assist you in determining:

<ul>
<li>When and how to make backups.</li>
<li>How to make things right after an unexpected data loss befalls your 
WordPress database.</li>
</ul>

Making backups is essential because problems inevitably occur and you 
need to be in a position to take action when disaster strikes. Spending 
a few minutes to make an easy, convenient backup of your database will 
allow you to spend even more time being creative and productive with 
your website.

For more information or to help volunteer on this WordPress Community 
Event, see <a 
href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups">WordPress Backup 
Week</a>.

miklb,

Based on the discussions on the hackers email list regarding the GPL
license, it seems there's nothing to stop you from creating (and even
selling) a book compiled from Codex.

 I'm sure new users of WordPress would thank you for creating something like
you suggest.

So if there's nothing stopping me, why did Lorelle say "There is also a lot 
that must be clarified for copyright protection and
contribution acknowledgements"? 
I by no means was suggesting that I was thinking of such a task on my own, I 
guess I was thinking out loud after seeing Urban Giraffee offer a printed 
version of their dissection of a theme.
http://www.urbangiraffe.com/themes/guides
I thought there may be a demand for a printed, scaled down version of the 
codex, that would also generate some revenue (I thought I'd seen a recent 
page in the codex referencing upcoming fund raising plans/ideas). If it was 
something that the overall community (or developers)wanted to pursue, I 
would by all means volunteer to assist in extracting the most pertinent info 
from the codex (installation, migration, upgrading, themes, template tags, 
CSS basics/reference, etc).
It wouldn't have to be offered as a comprehensive manual, rather simply a 
printed and bound "quick reference". Some people simply do better with 
something they can hold in their hand, and scribble in the margins. And a 
lot of these people would rather pay $20 for the info to be collected and 
printed for them, rather than doing it themselves.
And again, for anyone not familiar with the site that does this,
http://www.lulu.com/reader/create.php
No out of pocket expenses are needed, as mentioned before.

Michael spoke a little out of turn, perhaps. There are still discussions 
awaiting decisions and documentation updating to be done by Carthik, the 
master of the Codex ;-). He will be back soon and can address all of 
these issues.

Michael B, I know you are new to the documentation team, but you can 
browser through past discussions on the archives listed at the bottom of 
this email. There will see some of the past discussions we've had about 
protecting the rights of the contributors and other copyright issues.

Again, book or no book, we need to put our energies into filling in the 
gaps in the documentation. As familiar as I am with the Codex, the holes 
are big enough to drive a truck through and it is certainly in no way 
ready for "prime time book", even as a condensed help book.  And the 
decision to make it into a book is one that has to be made by Matt, not 
by "just anyone".

Such a discussion should also involve others on the Documentation team, 
many of whom are on vacation, so tabling this until Fall when others are 
present also might be a good idea.

I'm not stopping the process, just wanting to make sure that everyone is 
involved in the process.  Anyone can write a book on WordPress, though 
using the Codex without adequate and comprehensive permissions from all 
the "right folks" would really piss a lot of people off, something I'd 
like to avoid, and one has been written in German. As for the 
convenience of a printed book, more and more people are looking for 
books in digital form, so the future conversion of the WordPress Codex 
to pdf and such is something of greater value to more people. I, 
personally, read my books on my hand held computer, and I read alot, and 
haven't bought a paperback book in almost three years. I've paid for 
digital books, though. ;-)

Also, work is underway to connect the Codex more intimately with the 
Support Forum.  This will bring a lot of changes and I'm anxious to see 
where this leads.

Where do we state the license for Codex?  I assume it's GPL, but don't
see it stated anywhere.

If it is indeed GPL, there are no comprehensive permissions needed.

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhyNotGPLForManuals

"Anyone publishing the book on paper would have to either include
machine-readable "source code" of the book along with each printed copy,
or provide a written offer to send the "source code" later."

That's it.  In other words, if you publish Codex as a book, you must
make the "source code" (in this case the Wiki source) available upon
request.  Many publishers just ship a CD.

See also the LDP.

Only one page links to the disclaimer, and that page has no links to it.
I think it should be more prominent.

Look at the bottom of every page, just to the left of the MediaWiki
flower logo at the bottom right.

I think you should go for it. Set a date, drag people in to help and go 
for it.

As has already been pointed out, the GPL is there. I have made noises in 
the past about not enough prominence for that, but hey we are here 
today. And what is the choice ? that we bicker about license this that 
and the other while someone from outside rolls up a deal ? Not what we want.

Also, we are going to need a damn good book to go with the damn good 
code, support, hackers and coders. Good books take refining and we can't 
refine the best book until we've done the first and we reflect on it.

Given the constant changing nature of WP, I think producing a book will 
be a challenge in itself, but in the end, do we do it - or someone else ?

We do it.

My point to miklb was simply to say he doesn't need permission to create a
book.

The discussion on the hackers list (see
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-July/001836.html) was
enlightening to say the least.

But from that discussion it's clear that Carthik, or Michael B, or anybody,
can produce a book as long as the GPL is followed.

Knowing that should make it easier in the future to create a book, whether
it be paper or electronic.  The Codex team, or whoever decides to complile a
book, does not have to go through the nightmare of asking permission from
the hundreds (or thousands) of people who have contributed to Codex.

Interesting point here on 'source code'.

Would a PDF file suffice or does it need to be the actual wikified data now
rendered for the reader?

Or would MediaWiki software have to be delivered as part of that 'source
code'?

Well, providing PDF "source" for open source documentation would be a
little tacky, but I think it would suffice. ;-)  Generally, it's the
format of the "origin" document whether it be LaTeX, DocBook, HTML,
Word, etc., but, AFAIK, any editable electronic format will do.  Bits is
bits.

Not the software, just the markup.

Subject: [wp-docs] Holes in the documentation
Message-ID: <42D46B89.7050202@cameraontheroad.com>

My post about the holes in the documentation seems to be lost and I 
think it needs to be brought to the foreground.

While Cleanup Week fixed a lot of documentation, we have a LOT of holes 
and energy needs to be spent to fill them. Here is a list of holes that 
I see:

* http://codex.wordpress.org/Integrating_Wordpress_with_Your_Website - 
Constantly requested, NO information.
* Simple things like an article on how to activate the popup comments 
template, styling footers, and very basic information on themes and 
template tags.
* Conditional Tags and various queries - people are constantly asking 
questions about customizing queries and we have very little information 
to help people use conditional tags step-by-step to customize their post 
and template outputs.
* Foreign Language Installs and Support: I'm working with Moshu to clean 
up the mess and hopefully that will be ready next week but we need more 
on this subject.
* Development: the Codex is SERIOUSLY lacking in documentation to help 
developers and future developers. This includes development and writing 
of plugins. Some articles are underway but we need more.

 From http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_Wanted, Common 
Website Setups, highlighting each one as an article with possibly links 
to other articles for content that crosses models:

Basic Weblog Model
    * Basic Article Output and the Concept of Article Flow
    * Adding Article Archive to the Process
    * Expanding Your Site with Pages and Content
    * Custom Article Output with WordPress Categories

Intermediate Weblog Model
    * Adding Plugins to Your WordPress
    * Adding post popularity and ratings via plugins or otherwise
    * Adding Substructure to Your Site
        * Site Map
        * Custom Template pages/Pages
    * Controlling User Levels
    * Link Checking
    * Site Statistics and Monitoring
    * Controlling Comments

Photoblog, Portfolio or Photo Gallery Model
    * Theme based upon images not text
    * Loop customization for image oriented posts
    * Integrating Gallery Plugins/Add-ons
    * Adding Graphics/Photographs to Site (Thumbnails, etc.)

Business Site Model (CMS)
    * Adding E-commerce
    * Adding Ads (globally and per post)
    * Sign-ups/Registrations
    * Controlling User Levels
    * Controlling Comments
    * Mailing Lists
    * Contact Forms
    * Managing Links Internally and Externally
    * Link Checking
    * Site Statistics and Monitoring

Review Site Model
    * Rating Items Pages
    * Category/Individual Post styles
    * Controlling User Levels
    * Link Checking
    * Site Statistics and Monitoring
    * Controlling Comments

This is just a start, and there is more on the Codex:Tasks List. I'd 
like to put together a list of what other holes are missing in the 
documentation. So where are the holes you see in the documentation? Add 
them here and I'll put them on the Task List.

WOW. I think I stepped into more than I expected. Some very interesting 
insight however into those who are dedicated to the growth and development 
of WP. And I agree with Podz, better from within the community than out. Let 
me just add that I by no means meant to stir up a hornets nest, and perhaps 
learned a lesson of speaking up too soon. I will however, will make a 
concerted effort to learn more about the codex, in terms of the "backend", 
and confer with Carthik upon their return. It also seems if I'm to be 
serious about this project, iI need to familiarize myself with the upcoming 
release of 1.6. If anyone could direct me to the correct mailing list for 
that, by all means please point me in the right direction.

Subject: [wp-docs] More about a book
Message-ID: <42D4CF3A.4050404@tamba2.org.uk>

Late last year - before 1.5 - there was a post to the forums asking 
about whether a book would be warranted. I said No (as did others) and 
then promptly got very angry. The reasons why don't matter now. But what 
it clearly illustrated was that someone wanted to take information 
freely given by others, chop it about a bit and then sell it to a 
publisher. They make a nice profit for a few weeks work, and we forever 
pick up the pieces when people come to the forums saying "Well the book 
said....."
That scenario would seriously annoy me on a number of levels.
And it WILL happen.

Unless we get in first.
WordPress is ours. GPL all you want, but we have laboured on the project 
in many different ways over a long period of time. If there is to be a 
book then that must come from our hands, not those of someone out to 
make a quick buck.

We can be honest about the shelflife of the book, we can have 
"Official!" all over it, we can improve it version by version, we will 
have a tangible product of our work and that of others, we could all 
even call ourselves "Authors" :) - it's it the logical extension of all 
the work we have done so far isn't it ?
It will never be bang up to date but unless the coders take a few years 
off it never can be.
And if we don't start now, when do we ? When can we possibly be ready ?
(WordPress - the book. The /ideal/ stocking filler !)

I can't speak for Carthik but I doubt very much that given his time and 
involvement in WordPress that he would say No.

I can see there is a "rights" issue somewhere, but in some ways we 
already ride roughshod over that. If I post a solution to the forums and 
someone copies that to Codex, whose is it ? Submissions to the forum are 
not GPL. I wouldn't like to even guess where they would fall.
My feeling is that if WE publish a book and are open about costs and 
profits then as others see that there is no nest-feathering going on, 
that it really is given back to the project then if anything that would 
have a positive effect.

But we'll know nothing until it's published.

You have nothing to blame yourself for. A WP book will always be an 
emotive issue no matter when it's raised or by who. You just happened to 
say it first :)

I seem to recall someone saying that 20% of the code may change ? And 
that much of the underlying structure will remain so the basics are 
already there. As for lists - hackers and testers ?

Ryan's commit summaries are good:
http://boren.nu/archives/2005/07/12/wp-commit-digest-for-july-5-12/

The hackers mailing list is good.

The trac timeline is probably the best, though most dense, information:

I would be willing to do the book layout, editing, interface with
publisher (I have an account with LSI, but could do lulu or whatever).
I can say more, but just wanted to throw out the offer. I agree this
should come from within and profit the project.

As Carthik has been working on this since before day one, can we PLEASE 
not jump or make any decisions about this until he returns from his trip 
in a couple of weeks.  The Codex, FAQ site, and much of the core 
documentation for WordPress has been his baby for a very long time and 
it is critical that he is involved with any decision-making process with 
this, especially since he has been working on such a "book" concept for 
quite a while.

The ideas, offers of help, suggestions, and discussion are good, just 
avoid decisions until he returns.

Thanks,

Lorelle

With respect Lorelle, as has been pointed out, anyone can use the 
information to create a book under the GPL.

I could do it, Michael B could do it, Matt could and so could someone 
else who just points a spider at Codex.

I can see your point but with respect to Carthik too, if he said No it 
makes no difference.

Like I have said, a book WILL happen and I would rather it was us on the 
end of the project.

For the record, I certainly am not going to release something on my own, nor 
did I really have an inclination to assist the Codex team get one out, that 
is, until this thread manifested. So what kind of a time frame are we 
talking about Carthik being away, and is there anything documented as to 
what was planned?

I know comparing WP and MW is comparing apples and oranges, but is there
anything we can intuit / extrapolate from the Codex server configuration
in relation to its performance that would assist the WordPress
benchmarks effort?

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex Down Planning Session
Message-ID: <42D68675.4080800@cameraontheroad.com>

While I was gone, racing towards Memphis, Tennessee, only to have 
Hurricane Dennis follow us and leave a few inches of rain (much needed 
from the news reports) and some blowing winds, I want to thank everyone 
for helping cover the Codex and all.  Thank you muches.

Now that I've returned back to my home-not-home of Mobile, where the 
damage for the most part was minimal, I find that another hurricane hit 
the Codex.  I've posted other resources and how to access the Codex via 
Google Cache, but I would like to put a plan together that includes 
releasing such information on the Forum and how to handle this in the 
future.

Here is my general outline and please add and let's (eventually) put 
this on the Codex and keep it in our files when it is all put together 
so we know how to handle the next "Codex is down" report.

1. Assign "Codex Down" representation to four people who will notify 
Matt and then alert the others of such notification so Matt isn't 
overwhelmed. Consider: Carthik, Lorelle, Skippy, Podz - but that's open 
for debate. I think one or two others in reserve might be good, like 
Westi and....well, I hate naming names but we need some backups in case 
one or more of the first four are absent on vacation or hurricane runs.

2. Two volunteer representatives who will post a note onto the Forum 
explaining that the Codex is down and following something similar to 
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/39173 - we need more and/or better 
resources. It's a mess and needs fixing.

3. Posting to the Docs Mailing list, as Matt has just done, is 
WONDERFUL. Thank you.  We need such alerts to continue.

4. Consider the possibility of creating mirror sites?

Now, what else should be part of our plan for "Codex is down" and 
continuing to provide help and support to users?

Lorelle

I would suggest, and could help, with mirroring efforts and/or high
availability measures.  Even if the Codex gets knocked out, it would be
good to have a page up at the address that explains the situation and
provides links to the forum discussion, Google cache, etc.  This is not a
hard thing to accomplish with any crappy old computer in the server closet
and the high availability tools for Linux.

Okay the move is underway. This is again temporary, but it shouldn't go 
down at all. We have a fully redundant system for the codex being set up 
right now, but it isn't quite ready yet.

Considering a good amount of the userbase in #wordpress has dedicated 
servers, as well as myself, I'm sure we could get something like this 
going. Keep talking. I'm in as a volunteer.

Unfortunately it's not something a partial dedicated server can handle.

Within a month this will no longer be a problem.

Not to sound like a smartass, but what is a "partial dedicated server"? 
There are a handful including myself that have real, bonafide dedicated 
boxes. They DO exist.

A dedicated server that is running other stuff besides the Codex.

While Matt is handling the "business end of the stick", as my mother 
would say, I trust he is making the right decisions about servers and 
will seriously consider mirroring and other options.

I'm also looking for emergency planning techniques we can use to alert 
the "masses".  Any help would be appreciated there.

Also, the plans we put in place can also be used to support the forum if 
it ever goes down...which it hasn't for a while.

Procedures:
1.  Alert Matt
2.  Alert Matt
3.  If Codex is down, put thead on forum that Codex is down, and keep
bumping it. Send email to [wp-docs] email list.
4.  If Forum is down, send email to [wp-forums] email list.  Might also
consider putting header, like the current Backup Week announcement, on the
Codex Main Page that forum is down.

Since Matt has the "business end of the stick" handled, there's not much
more to do is there?

Could we have a "super sticky"?  That is, a message that can be
displayed above everything, on every page, announcing that the codex is
down?  Make it white text on a red background.  Mavens could enable the

It might also be useful for a little blurb to be placed above the  
headers in the Support Forums. Another option would be to use  
stickies on a posting to avoid the bumping that usually takes place  
when and to keep it from slipping down among the threads.

That's brilliant.  But since the Codex would be down, putting a note on 
the Codex might be a challenge. Is there a way to add a temporary notice 
to the WordPress Support Forum at the top, that isn't a post but a 
notice above the posts?

Maybe all this planning will not be needed, but we've been battling this 
problem with Codex and Forums (though not there lately) for over six 
months. I just think we need a plan in place.

Ringmaster/Owen has done a great article in response to a bunch of

endure. 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Ringmaster/WordPress_in_High_Traffic - 
He has asked me to ask you to review, edit, rip and tear on it.  Hackers 
have also been asked.

This is a great article for the Codex and while it applies to only a few 
users, it's very important to the overall WordPress documenation.  Thanks.

About the redirects, is this for redirecting specific pages to the new 
"related" page on the Codex or the entire site to the Codex?  I'm not 
clear about it's usage or how to do this.

We still have a few pages that are worth grabbing. I was hoping they 
would be grabbed and put in the Codex during the cleanup, but they 
weren't. And there really isn't much left there that still applies.  So 
any kind of redirect would be a good idea.

Lorelle

=======
Using this plugin:

http://wiki.wordpress.org/?pagename=RedirectToPlugin

I think we should turn all pages possible on the old wiki into redirects.

http://wiki.wordpress.org/

Many pages on the old wiki show up pretty high in search engines.

As part of my "real" job we've tried dozens of these screen recording
utilities for recording on Windows and deploying as Flash. It has come
down to Macromedia Captivate (formerly RoboDemo), which is really the
standard at this point, or Wink for something that is free and does
just about everything most people need (Captivate has some e-learning
features that are nice for classes, but not much use here).

Camtasia does a good job as well, but doesn't provide the nice
automated popups and pointers for actions.

To make the transition to the new hosted and ultra-reliable platform,

happens. Everything will be available for reading, it's just that any

Back on the list.

I had some significant changes to make to this page, so rather than 
stomp on the current version, I moved off a copy to my user area:

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:ringmaster/Hardening_WordPress

Please review and update.  If/When you think it's ready to move back, 
please do so, I think I've exhausted my input on it until it needs updated.

That reminds me... The whole "renaming the admin account" problem 
doesn't exist in 1.6.  Not sure where to note that since 1.6 isn't live 
yet, but the docs should change when it is.

...And I guess that the list is the place to make suggestions until the 
move is complete...

The reason you can't change the admin username in 1.5 via WP is because 
in order to edit a user, you must have a higher user level than the 
level of the user you want to edit.

Since "admin" is level 10, it can't edit itself, and WordPress 1.5 
doesn't let you promote past user level 9.

In 1.6 SVN, your ability to edit users is dependent on having the 
edit_users capability.  If you have it, you can edit users.  Period.

Since there is no heirarchical distinction between users in the new 
role-based system, there is no way for WP 1.6 to know what WP 1.5 knows 
about "lesser" users not editing users with a "higher level".  There's 
just no such concept.

As such, users with the "Administrator" role (an arbitrary name for the 
benefit of assigning a pre-configured set of capabilities) have the 
edit_users capability, and those users can edit any username.  So you 
need not use phpMyAdmn to change the default "admin" username if you 
don't want to in 1.6.

Owen, and others who might have missed Matt's alert. The WordPress Codex 
will be "functioning" for reading but not for writing.  No editing will 
be able to be done for the next 24 hours or so while the database is 
backedup, moved, and restored, or something like that.

PLEASE, save any documentation you are working on in a safe place and 
hang on until Matt let's us know that everything is back working and 
functioning again.  Apologizes to everyone who want to make changes and 
add documentation, but hopefully this move will make the Codex stronger 
and more stable. Thanks for the patience.

And Owen, Eads, Skippy, and everyone else who has worked so hard on this 
article on Hardening WordPress.  It is one of the most edited and 
rewritten and worked on documents on the Codex, I think.  Be proud. This 
will help a lot of people, from the nervous to the advanced user, 
understand how secure WordPress is and how to make it more secure.  And 
hopefully not give tips to the evil time wasters out there.  Thanks for 
all your hard work and when the Codex database is back open, we'll clean 
up Owen's version and get things rockin' again.

Thank you,

I had already posted the edits to Codex and was in the middle of my 
email when Matt's message came over, so I hope that the updates took 
hold before the freeze.

So much for security, I might be losing data already.  :)

Message-ID: <42D9CEE3.6030005@cameraontheroad.com>

Matt just told me that the Codex will not be "officially" ready until 
Monday as there have been a few minor problems in the recent transfer. 
The database is not locked down and edits are possible, but when the 
final move comes on Monday, some of those edits may be lost. While we 
should be able to compare changes with the history and replace anything 
lost, I don't think there is enough energy or volunteers to go through 
EVERYTHING that may get changed in the next few days. So let's hold off.

I have a huge file I'm keeping with notes on things that need to be 
fixed and added to the Codex, so my fingers are itching, but I'm holding 
back.

Consider this a weekend off from Codex and we'll all be back hacking 
away at it by Monday afternoon.  Thanks for your patience and thanks for 
all the work you do on the Codex. It has really grown into an amazing 
collection of articles and documentation. Thanks!

I've changed the "backup week" message on the main Codex page to a
message warning all volunteers about this--since we shouldn't assume
they all subscribe to this list.

Hi!
As far as I understand, it's about redirecting on a per page basis.
What you do, basically, is to enter the following at the top of each site in 
the wiki (this example is for the non-existing page 
http://wiki.wordpress.org/SomePage): 

<?plugin RedirectTo href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Some_Page" ?>

This will redirect the user to the corresponding Codex page. By only 
inserting the line, and _not_ deleting the original content on the 
wiki.wordpress.org <http://wiki.wordpress.org> site, people still get the 
chance to view the original version if needs be by calling the original page 
like so:
http://wiki.wordpress.org/?pagename=SomePage&redirectfrom=

Message-ID: <42DBB7B9.6010408@cameraontheroad.com>

Below is another press release for backup week.  PLEASE post it on your 
blogs, email it to friends, and edit it however you like. Also, this is 
an "official" press release from WordPress so do not use phrases like 
"Lorelle says". Just copy and paste the information below onto your site 
or emails, or rewrite it yourself with some sob story about your 
computer or server crashing to help everyone understand that BACKING UP 
is a good thing. Even if the story does not pertain to WordPress.  The 
Forum and Codex volunteers need your help to get this unusual event 
promoted. It begins in five days, so we need help from all of you. Thanks.

===============

WordPress is celebrating blog security and protection with WordPress 
Backup Week July 23-30.

WordPress, one of the most popular blogging and website management 
tools, is sponsoring WordPress Backup Week July 23-30. Step-by-step 
backup instructions will be available in the online manual, the 
WordPress Codex (http://codex.wordpress.org), and online in the 
WordPress Support Forum (http://www.wordpress.org/support) to help you 
through the process.

Your database contains every post, every comment and every link you have 
on your blog. If your database gets erased or corrupted, you stand to 
lose everything you have written. There are many reasons why this could 
happen and not all are things you can control. But what you can do is 
backup your data, after all, it is important isn't it? Making backups is 
essential because problems inevitably occur and you need to be in a 
position to take action when disaster strikes. Spending a few minutes to 
make an easy, convenient backup of your database will allow you to spend 
even more time being creative and productive with your web site.

Backing up your WordPress database has never been easier with WordPress 
plugins which allow you control over how, what, and when you backup, 
even emailing your database backups to you - all pain free.  
Documentation is available to take you through the step-by-step process, 
as well, for backing up your WordPress site and database with cPanel, 
vDeck, DirectAdmin, Plesk, and others.

For your own protection and security, and peace of mind, join us in 
learning how to backup and protect our valuable data and writings during 
WordPress Backup Week. Consider using this Backup Week as an incentive 
to backup all your valuable documents and software, too.

it with a fine tooth comb. I believe there maybe some more server

graphics is borked right now. We're waiting for the fix.  Go through the 
document and make sure it is in great shape and ready for the public,

Matt has just told me that the Codex is open for business. It still 
hasn't been moved or the database synched, but he has promised to make 
sure nothing gets lost in the final transfer.

So, unleash your pent up volunteer needs for documentation and attack 
the Codex again. We need work on the new 
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups and a lot of other stuff. 

If you are writing new documents, save a copy on your computer, just in 
case....after all, we are heading into a busy Backup Week and I'd hate 
to have our story be one of the sob stories at 
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/39496

Oh, and by the way, jonimueller has offered to make some buttons and 
banners for WordPress Backup Week, so we will temporarily add those to 
the forum and Codex when they are ready.  That will be fun.

Thanks to all!

I had a bit of free time, so I translated it into French and posted it
on the WordPress into French blog :
http://xavier.borderie.net/wp-fr/2005/07/19/semaine-de-la-sauvegarde/
.

This follows a previous post calling for help on translating the main
parts of the Codex into French - with little success thus far. Still
hangin' there...

Thanks for helping to promote the backup week.  I've posted your request 
for translators at http://wordpress.org/support/topic/39583 and in a few 
hours you might want to make a comment there to keep it up on the list 
if it drops off.

And I've asked Matt to include it in the Dev Blog.  Thanks and keep up 
the great work.

Oh, by the way, I and others will be changing the structure of the 
localization and translation pages in the next week and any help will be 
appreciated. They've become quite a mess and we're subdividing the pages 
to be more helpful.  See http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle my user 
page for the start of the process.  We still have more work to do.

Thanks!

Wow.  http://blog.jalenack.com/archives/codex-search-plugin/ Jalenack 
and Ringmaster have come up with an amazing plugin and we all get to be 
the beta testers for it over the next week.

It creates a search box at the top of the Administration Panels that 
allows searching of the Codex and Forums. The Codex articles are listed 
at the top of the list and the forum posts at the bottom, to disguish 
between "official" docs and forum help.  WOW.

Check it out, run it through as many paces and systems as you can and 
report to Jalenack's website to leave comments and bug reports.  There 
have been attempts before to do this but this one really ties it all 
together.  I hope it will bring new meaning to "Search First" and really 
benefit users, connecting them right away with documentation and help.

There was a discussion with Podz about providing "lessons" on the Forum

need to prepare the Codex for 1.6 articles. Is anyone here ready, 
willing, and able to help prepare such documentation and lessons?  It's 
not something that has to happen immediately, but plans need to be in 
place to help everyone make the transition smoother. Any volunteers, 
comments, suggestions?

Beta time.
I think we need to hang fire on this until 1.6 comes into the realm of 
testing for bugs rather than testing to see what's broken - which is 
where I think it is right now for your average user. When 1.6 goes into 
that phase - which will not be a day or two long - then we can be 
confident of a couple of things:
- the people that like shiny code CAN grab it to use without quite as 
many potential problems as they could have now
- the people that want to write up for Codex will be able to use final 
code to do that.
I can see this needing to be planned but even on this list we have to be 
careful no to produce any hype.

Message-ID: <42E2B553.8000506@cameraontheroad.com>

Moshu and others have been working hard on totally revising the two 
Localization articles for WordPress in Your Language on the Codex.  They 
are finally done and out for display.

There are now three localization articles on the Codex. We hope that 
these three documents will make it easier for people to find WordPress 
in their Language and easily install it.

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language - List of all 
Foriegn Language offerings regarding WordPress including forums, 
documentation, installation files, mo files, and general WordPress 
sites. Each country/language has it's own section heading to make it 
easy to add all language/WordPress related information. It also creates 
a Table of Contents listing for fast access to different language 
information. (These need to be gone over thoroughly, updated, added to, 
and cleaned up)

http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language - 
Installation now has its own page with simple step-by-step 
instructions.  Any instructions different from these per "your" language 
files needs to be clear in that language's section in 
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language

http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress - Everything, or almost 
everything, you need to know to help translate WordPress into different 
languages.

A lot of redirects are on the Codex covering the MANY old names for this 
information and hopefully I have caught all the redirects. Please let me 
know if I missed any.

Thanks to Moshi and everyone for their hard work on improving these 
documents. They are AMAZING.

Just a heads up.

Someone moved the Main_Page to something else... :(

I managed to undo the move on Main_Page:Talk but we need the new Main_Page
(which Robert created while trying to clean up) deleting and the old one
undoing to preserve the history of changes.

It probably needs a codex admin to do it as now we have a new Main_Page
created the undo won't work for me :(

Subject: [wp-docs] Adding Keywords to Theme List
Message-ID: <42EC03D7.6060405@cameraontheroad.com>

After discussion with MacManx and others who keep an eye on the Theme 
List, and a few Theme authors, we've decided to add keywords to the 
Codex Theme list at http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes/Theme_List.

We've asked authors to help, we also need volunteers to help us to add 
keywords to the list. Please pitch in.  Authors may modify the 
information later, but we need to help users find themes that suit their 
needs and the list is now very long. We're hoping that through this 
keyword process, we can broaden the Theme categories, too.

While adding keywords to themes, we're finding some dead or wrong links. 
So this is a great way to clean out the clutter. Here is the 
instructions from MacManx on how the "cleaning" should work: "If it's a 
404 or some other sort of error, go back the root domain and attempt to 
find a post or page for the specific theme. If you can't find one, or if 
the entire site is inaccessible, then we should remove the theme's 
listing. If you can find a post or page for the theme, then just replace 
the theme's listed link. The key thing to keep in mind is that the 
Theme's listed link must go to a post or page that describes the theme 
and provides a download link."

To explain the keyword process better, here is a copy of the message 
left on Theme authors who posted links to their themes on the Codex in 
the past 4-5 months.

== Adding Keywords to Themes List ==

To help users find themes appropriate to their needs, we are asking 
Theme authors and volunteers to create a keyword description list for 
all the Themes on the [[Using Themes/Theme List]].

'''These are not reviews but searchable keywords'''.  Examples include:

* Minimal, large header, elastic layout across width of screen, 
navigation in header, sidebar on right on all views
* Minimalistic, white background, letter look, centered on page, Default 
Theme style sidebar on right, no sidebar on single post page, based on 
Default Theme. (Screenshot)
* Content against left margin, simple, sidebar and/or navigation on 
right, post content in "boxes". (Demo Site)

Specifically, users need to know:

* Sidebar on right, left, two sidebars (positioning), and sidebars on 
single post view and/or multi-post views
* Minimalistic, busy, boxed, round corners, structural details
* Elastic width, fixed in the center, or fixed width against the left margin
* Incorporation of plugins
* If screenshot or full demo available for viewing
* Navigation in header, sidebar, and/or footer
* Header ready for header image
* Gallery, photoblog, or CMS features
* Languages (Only available in a non-English language? If language 
specific, please post a link on [[WordPress in Your Language]], too)

Thank you for helping us flesh out the Theme list and help direct users 
to the Themes they need. And thank you for your valuable contributions 
to the WordPress Community.  Lorelle

===========

Thanks for helping out on this. If we all take a few minutes to do 10 of 
these each, the list will be done in no time at all.

Hi Lorelle,

Just wanted to say hello. 

I have a house full of kids this summer so I haven't helped much but I
have some days off next week and I'll work on this. I was thinking a
checklist form might help, and I can create one from this list you
have created... then maybe we can talk about reports. Sounds like a
job easily chunked.

WordPress ROCKS!

A check off list would be nice. Maybe add it to the Theme Development

Anyone have any recommendations about what should be on such a check off 
list for theme keywords?

Thanks!
