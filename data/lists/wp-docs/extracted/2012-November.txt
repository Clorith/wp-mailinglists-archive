Message-ID: <CAHBjUcQrBzweLGyfkUzPDZddSBzXJ2K_1t=fz0ivrQiRV0A1oQ@mail.gmail.com>

People who are using WordPress "as a CMS" have frequently the need to
change the labels of "Posts" into something else.

There are some functions for that, change_post_object_label() and
change_post_menu_label().

They work fine, and are described at different corners of the web:

- http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/9211/changing-admin-menu-labels
- http://wordpress.org/support/topic/change-labels-in-admin-section
- http://wordpress.org/support/topic/modifying-post-name-article-into-something-else

Is there any reason why this information isn't in the Codex?

Neither of these functions are present in WordPress. They are
functions that people have written themselves and posted to the sites
you linked to. There is no reason they would be on the Codex.

I think this brings to light sort of a fair question. Should the Codex
consist only of officially supported functionality?

post_is_in_descendant_category() springs to mind. It's provided as an
example in the in_category()<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/in_category#post_is_in_descendant_category_function>article.
Do we pull it out or leave it in as an alternative, unsupported
function?

As long as the Codex contains official documentation, I would say no.
It's too easy to confuse the two. If there were a "user contributions"
section on every page, that would be different though.

" If there were a "user contributions"

So for section of the codex where you are able to do things like this, is
this something we should consider?

That's exactly what I wanted to know. Just by looking at the code,
it's hard for me to tell if that custom_detail_post_labels() function
is less official than, say, the register_post_type function. Both look
similarly clean, or hackish, depending on your milage. It could very
well be "official but undocumented".

Now, I don't know how widely spread this particular piece of code is,
but as you can see, it's circulating. Just a bit of wishful thinking:
for a theme designer, it would be great to have a "popular wisdom"
section in the Codex that would document such methods (with a
disclaimer telling that it's not officially supported), and some
rating and comments system that would allow to measure the general
usefulness and popularity of such recipes (similarly to the plugins).

Or is wordpress.stackexchange supposed to do exactly that? Maybe, but
I think it would be good to centralize things more. Stackexchange is
useful, but extremely disorganized. Having to hunt for information
between Codex, stackexchange, forums and personal developer blogs can
induce schizophrenia after some time.

So basically it's an example of an existing filter - which you do have to
write your own function for.

I agree this is a great example use-case. Some people can read the docs,
but learn better from example code.

I've been off the grid and catching up.

We have a variety of tutorials on the Codex that are outside of "official
documentation," whatever that means. In the past, that meant anything in
the Codex that passed the muster of the docs team (or any passer by. :D ).
It became representative of documentation that was "frozen," linked to from
the WordPress Administration Panels.

There is no reason why a tutorial article on such a task would be allowed
in the Codex unless the rules have changed. If this is an example usage of
an existing filter, then it would be an excellent addition to the Codex.

I like the format adopted by php.net/manual where there is a long list of
'user contributed notes' under each of the entries. There are lots of
useful information down there.
And it is so easy to drop a new note there.

As far as I can tell, there doesn't appear to be a page on the Codex
explaining the accessibility features of WordPress itself. The page at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Accessibility is a technical page
explaining how to implement accessibility features in themes and
plugins.

Does anyone know of such a page I'm missing?

If not I would be more than happy to start one. It's the sort of page
I'd like to try to get a link to from within WordPress itself.

There is not such a page on the Codex. I've been wanting one for a long
time. Glenda Watson-Hyatt and become quite the expert on the accessibility
features of WordPress over the various versions, but she hasn't expressed
an interest in writing such a document, even though I nag often. :D

With the new US federal law on web accessibility as of March 2012 in place,
it is critical we explain how WordPress complies with P.O.U.R. Guidelines
and web standards both on the front and back ends. WordPress does not
adequately comply with the new US federal laws or international country
laws consistently, especially when it comes to images and links. These need
to be pointed out an the correct actions need to be encouraged.

Let me know how I can help if you need any. And thanks for taking this on.

Thank you, Lorelle. I'll start a draft page under my account soon.

On a related note, do you know who I'd contact about getting
permission to post to Make/Accessibility? I've been given permission
to post to Make/Polyglots but I'm not sure who gave me that
permission.

Esmi is the admin on make/accessibility, though we're discussing rolling 
it into make/core rather than segregating it.

Lorelle, I'm an advocate of accessible sites and explaining things like
Section 508 (and have been since there was a WWW), but--I'm unclear about
how WordPress is required to "comply" with US accessibility laws or laws
of other countries. Also, I'm not clear how WordPress currently prevents
building accessible sites for those aiming to create them. Can you explain
that a bit, or point me towards more information?

Thanks,
-james

Hi folks,

Not sure if this the right list for this, but seems like a good fit.

It's that time of the cycle again to audit the Help text. The trac ticket
for 3.5 is here: #22451 <http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22451>

I've already combed through every single-site Dashboard page and submitted
grouped patches last week. But now I need your help! If anybody is willing
and able to go through and review some or all of them, I'd be grateful for
the collaboration and extra eyes.

WordPress itself would come under the general heading of "CMS/Software 
Requirements" within the anti-discrimination laws of any given country. 
Certainly in the UK, it would fall under the Disability Discrimination 
Act if it did not make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled 
users are not unfairly disadvantaged when it came to using the software. 
Many other countries in Europe have similar - if not more stringent - 
legal requirements. I'd imagine ADA would apply in the US.

Legality aside, there are the ethical responsibilities to ensure that 
disabled users can create sites as easily as possible. And there are 
quite a few disabled users who use WordPress as their CMS of choice - 
primarily because it already offers a reasonable level of accessibility. 
But that doesn't mean it can't be improved. We also need to teach people 
how to get the best of the features that it offers. :-)

AFAIIA, Section 508 only applies to the public-facing side of (federal?) 
sites. So the onus is really on the site owner but, again, I think we 
have an ethical duty to help people create the most accessible sites 
that they can.

Many thanks, esmi. Maybe I was tripped up by the word "comply". Ethical
reasons aside (which I agree with), I wasn't aware of a *requirement* to
comply with any accessbility regulations.

By the way, I'd make one addition to what you said about Section 508: it's
not simply the "public-facing side of (federal?) sites"--it's much more,
and encompasses hardware and software. It also applies to technology that
the feds *buy or use*. So, my experience has been that "compliance" comes
into play when you're trying to sell something to the government. Not sure
about the UK environment.

Cheers,
-james

WordPress itself would come under the general heading of "CMS/Software
Requirements" within the anti-discrimination laws of any given country.
Certainly in the UK, it would fall under the Disability Discrimination
Act if it did not make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled
users are not unfairly disadvantaged when it came to using the software.
Many other countries in Europe have similar - if not more stringent -
legal requirements. I'd imagine ADA would apply in the US.

Legality aside, there are the ethical responsibilities to ensure that
disabled users can create sites as easily as possible. And there are
quite a few disabled users who use WordPress as their CMS of choice -
primarily because it already offers a reasonable level of accessibility.
But that doesn't mean it can't be improved. We also need to teach people
how to get the best of the features that it offers. :-)

AFAIIA, Section 508 only applies to the public-facing side of (federal?)
sites. So the onus is really on the site owner but, again, I think we
have an ethical duty to help people create the most accessible sites
that they can.

It's a legal issue now in the United States. I know it was quiet but I
and many others promoted it long before it became law in March 2012.

On the issue of WordPress "preventing building accessible sites,"
that's not true. Accessibility is mostly reliant upon Themes and
Plugins. That must be clear, however, WordPress does not enforce
compliance with images and links which is part of the requirements for
accessibility and part of the WordPress core programming. The only
"responsibility" WordPress core can really offer, to my understanding,
is compliance within the content area. The rest is Theme and Plugin
design and programming elements to insure P.O.U.R. is met for
perceivable, operable, understanding, and robust guidelines. WordPress
can do more in the core for mobility features and browser
compatibility on the backend, but the front end is Theme and Plugin
authors' responsibility.

An accessibility expert told me one time that it would be interesting
to see a WordPress specific lawsuit over this. Would the site owner be
completely liable or would some of the onus be on WordPress and/or the
web developer(s), Theme designers, and Plugin authors for
non-compliance. I think that's a valid question that needs answering
to help protect all parties involved. Hold harmless can only go so
far, and we all know that ignorance of the laws means squat.

I hope I am not muddying the waters. I just want to make sure that
compliance with international law is considered in the article so we
can best serve our audience. This is no longer an ethical decision but
a legal one. Having followed the lawsuits of these cases over the
years closely, there is a lot of legal involved, but it boils down to
simple things that could have been done right in the first place, if
people understood these are not ethical or "right" choices but the
law.

Thanks!

It's the same in the UK and many countries in Europe. Government sites 
and agencies are expected to lead the way when it comes to 
accessibility. And this includes non-web (office) software. Some 
government departments are refusing to even consider software unless 
it's been accredited as "accessible".

Unfortunately, in the US, it is the corporations and individuals to
lead the way rather than the government. I often stumble upon US
government sites that are still left over from the pre 1999 table
days! LOL! Good at making laws but not following their own.

Still, the law on accessibility for web design is now in force in the
US and lawyers have been waiting for this eagerly.

I agree that compliance should be an ethical decision. Facts are that
the laws are the laws, even the odd ones.

In Washington State, it is illegal to drive a car without windshield
wipers. There are no laws requiring windshields. :D

Yep. As soon as Target, Priceline and Ramada were successfully sued 
under ADA some years back, it opened the way for stricter regs under 
ADA. Section 508 is a little passe these days in that it was only really 
focused on government sites.

Applying some kind of reasonable accessibility adjustment under ADA 
brings the US in line with the more recent laws in some European countries.

Out of the box, WP + Twenty Eleven is pretty accessible. It's not 
perfect but it's a lot better than many CMS out there. There's also a 
very strong commitment to make WordPress core even more accessible - 
which is a far cry from some of the stories I've heard about Drupal or 
Joomla. Without the current accessibility level and the desire to 
improve it, I doubt I'd be hanging around here. :-)

> Accessibility is mostly reliant upon Themes and

To some extent, yes but there is room for improvement in core. And this 
is being worked on but, like all improvements, good stable changes tend 
to happen slowly.

The problem here (as I see it) is that WordPress is a tool that has to 
be everything to everyone. And like any tool, it helps if you understand 
how to use it properly. Make it too restrictive in an effort to enforce 
accessibility and you will cause problems - not least for those who do 
actually know what they're doing. So you have to strike a reasonable 
balance and try to educate those using the "tool" badly.

Site owners must take responsibility for their own sites. WordPress 
core, themes & plugins can only do so much. Everything else is down to 
site authors. They have to create their content intelligently to 
complete the accessibility picture and we can help them to some extent. 
That's why I re-wrote <http://codex.wordpress.org/Accessibility> to try 
and focus on practical steps that non-technical site authors can take.

It's also worth bearing in mind that disabled users also have a 
responsibility to learn how to use their AT software effectively (a 
factor often gets overlooked).

Under UK law, the responsibility lies fairly and squarely with the site 
owner. It is up to him/her to choose the right CMS and there is a fair 
amount of documentation available to help would-be site owners in this 
regard. We even have a published British Standard:

<http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/Browse-by-Subject/Accessibility/>

I'm pretty sure that other European countries have similar laws & 
resources. Germany & the Netherlands spring to mind. The Philippines are 
also being very pro-active in promoting accessibility across the ICT board.

That's definitely The Stick but there's also The Carrot. Accessible 
sites very often out-perform their less accessible counterparts - both 
in terms of SEO and user popularity. Tesco.com (one of the world's 
largest grocery retailers) take web accessibility really, *really*, 
seriously. Ever since the response to their first "accessible" site 
exceeded their wildest expectations. Legal & General (a big UK insurance 
firm) reported a 90% increase in online sales 12 months after launching 
their first accessible site.

These are not fluffy social organisations. They're hard-nosed 
corporations with their eyes firmly fixed on the bottom line. They both 
made their initial site changes based on the fear of legal action but 
became very public advocates of accessibility once they realised its 
benefits.

I think that's the line that we need to promote to site owners.

In terms of supporting disabled owners of WordPress, I agree that we've 
not really got much in the way of specific Codex documentation or pages 
in <http://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/> to support them. And 
that's something that should really be rectified. Perhaps I could ask 
some of the AT users on contributors to 
<http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/> to help with this? A couple 
of them are pretty experienced.

I agree. James, would you be willing to talk to some of the
accessibility team members? You volunteered and Mel and I went
overboard helping. :D

It's good to know that at least one country puts the onus on site
owners. I still believe that WordPress needs to step up more and
making link titles and image alternative descriptions required (in
addition to the title for the database) is a simple and easy to
implement step. Hard to do that when people click and drag stuff into
WordPress, but it is a start for those who use it better.

Glenda Watson Hyatt has offered her services and advice to WordPress
in the past on accessibility, and I've recommended hiring her as a
consultant for years. Here are some of her recent posts on the
subject.

http://blogaccessibility.com/take-the-accessibility-challenge-make-your-next-blog-post-accessible-in-75-seconds/
http://www.21times.org/archives/glenda-watson-hyatts-top-7-countdown-of-common-accessibility-struggles/

She wrote a great post about WordPress accessibility - several of
them, but I can't find them and I have to race out the door to teach.
ARGH.

Anyway, thanks, James, for letting us run off on our favorite subject.
Mel and I have very vested interests in accessibility issues - as you
can tell. :D

I disagree. If you do that, then you take away people's ability to use 
purely presentational images (eye candy) which, ideally should have a 
null alt (alt="") attribute.

Oh - and thanks me reminding me about Glenda. I used to chat with her

Purely presentational images should be in the Theme not the post area.
If they are, they should be seriously reconsidered. LOL!

I understand the usage in Themes and Plugins, but not in content.
That's the area I'm addressing.

I can't find the ticket currently (or it may be in the massive media revamp
ticket) but I believe the core team has already been persuaded to include
alt tags only in inserted images. It's a tiny tiny accessibility step but
one that was oft-requested.

Still disagree. Eye candy is fine in content and it wouldn't be feasible 
to stop site authors from adding their own images to Posts/Pages. Added 
to which, contextual but non-informative images can help support 
comprehension for those visitors who first language is not written (ie 
deaf users) or those with learning difficulties (dyslexia etc).
