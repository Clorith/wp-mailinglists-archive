This chap is still at it - linking off to tenuously related sites from 
WordPress in your language and adding a "maintained by" link to "www 
dalefondos com"

Is it possible to add that site specifically to the Codex spam filter?

I've just tried a gentler approach. I've protected and locked the page
so that only admins can edit it. This presents a couple of problems
but I think we can handle them.

1. Can you forward the information to Jane or Matt about contacting
this guy (not sure exactly who is the "right" person but they will
know - if they aren't monitoring the discussion right now) so they can
let him know that his efforts are not appreciated and need to stop.
Maybe a bigger hammer will work. And maybe they can block his site or
IP or something, since this dude is seriously determined.

2. I'll post something on the translation mailing list about this page
to have them contact us if they have something to add or fix on the
page. It is a nuisance, but some of them may have admin status and can
edit in spite of us, which would be fine. We need to make sure that
the "leaders" of the translation group have admin access accordingly.

Thanks again for keeping an eye on this. What a pain. Amazing that
this guy is SO determined to spam, when there isn't a single WordPress
subject on his site, however, I don't want to give him credit for
determination. I want him to STOP as it is clearly a time waster for
all of us, especially you. Thanks so much for staying on top of this!
You rock!!!

He is an SEO spammer, and sadly this is how they all operate.
Bolstering links into "trusted" sites is a strategy to increase their  
Google pagerank. Any sort of wiki is a target - and he's easily  
identified by his amateurish spammy source code:

http://cl.ly/36Im

The simplest way to get rid of him would be to automatically add  
rel="nofollow" to all external anchor tags inside the codex. To an SEO  
spammer this eliminates any link value which he's hoping to generate,  
so there's just no point continuing to do it :)

Or I can just go all Thor with the ban hammer and delete his account.

What's the page he's editing, or username, or what have you?

Multiple usernames for the same spam -

 Gonzalox  Pawi  Fandox possibly others.

Check the history of WordPress in your language specifically the deleted
revisions.

I also have the chap's gmail account if that's any use.

On Wikipedia we would block him and his IP (autoblock?) and disable account
creation. Wikipedia also has rel=nofollow on [most] links.

I've done this multiple times. ;) (Though I guess new accounts are at

He keeps reopening accounts, so Thor has been ineffective with his
hammer. mrmist has had conversations with him asking him to stop and
nothing has stopped. nofollow is ineffective as it leaves the crap
while taking away nothing. Search engines stopped recognizing nofollow
a long time ago, if they ever really did.

Hopefully protecting the page so only admins can edit will stop it for
now but we need to know if there is an IP block or something similar
that will prevent his accessing the Codex, unless he's smart enough to
use a proxy. There are ways around everything, so protecting the page
from edits seems to be the best bet, as that is the one is he
targeting. If he starts on another page... sigh.

This has been a problem since the beginning but this person is beyond
persistent. It's a really strange case and kudos to mrmist for staying
on top of this above and beyond the call of duty.

Normally when you block a person, there's a checkbox to autoblock the
IP as well. Of course, that can be worked around, but if that isn't
effective, we can take more strenuous measures.

Of course, there is no guaranteed way to ever block anybody for
certain. You just have to set the bar high enough to make it not worth
the trouble.

BTW, if somebody wants to be really proactive about this sort of
thing, here's a feed of all changes made to the codex, as they happen.

No worries.. It's what I do..

Protect it probably best for now (that page is really only updated 
around new releases anyway) but would be good if Otto can come up with 
something so we can remove the protect soonish.

For future reference, since I seemed to have missed the announcement.
the wp-polygots mailing list is now at
http://wppolyglots.wordpress.com/ and on P2 and not a mailing list.
Took me a while to figure out why the email bounced back. They've now
been notified.

And why don't we have such a fun playground? :D

Yeah I checked the block logs and (I reckon) the autoblock has kicked in 
to prevent some accounts, but he's either used alternative IP addresses, 
or the autoblocks  (IP) expire more quickly than the imposed blocks.

It's all fun (!)

Lorelle,

I had the very unfortunate experience of working in the SEO industry  
for some years, and while I didn't enjoy any of it - I did learn about  
what search engines do and don't recognise and, much more importantly,  
what SEO engineers think search engines do and don't recognise.

rel="whatever" used to carry a lot of weight with search engines  
(that's a fact) and it still does carry some weight, but to a far  
lesser extent. This guy still thinks the "keywords" meta tag is  
effective, so it's pretty reasonable to assume that he isn't all that  
up to date on modern practices.

IP banning can be circumvented by proxy easily, you don't have to be  
smart for that.

Introducing a dynamic rel="nofollow" attribute on external links is  
easy and does no harm to the codex at all - personally, I would give  
it a try.

Just my 2c

John

Just to keep you updated (as I'm sure you all want to hear more of this 
fascinating saga ;) the page was edited today (same sort of spam 
attributions), so it looks like the "protect" doesn't actually work.

I reverted the page to how it was when the protect was set.

You can check out the logs, but many of the revisions have been hidden 
(so as to hide the spam links) so you won't be able to check them out 
with a normal user account.

He's used a whole load of account names.  Check my most recent 5 or so 
blocks in the block log to see which ;)  Fandox, Gondolox, Fandoxman, 
etc..

I believe it might be your settings. Stick this at the end of
localsettings.php and post the output (if you want). It will break the wiki
until you change it back.

echo '$wgGroupPermissions = ' . var_export($wgGroupPermissions,true);
break;

On second thought, don't, because it will tell everyone exactly what they
can and can't do, so use it at your own risk. Here is the output from a

Possibly, I'm just a sysop. Though the rights page suggests that protect 
is amongst that set.

But looks like Otto's set the same now, and he's a site God, so if that 
don't work, nothing will.

He's also deleted some of the remaining crud that I must have missed, or 
accidentally left behind. Cheers Otto!

Otto is also just a sysop, along with 'crat and whatever else. Having FTP
doesn't make any difference to the wiki. I can still edit.

I have access to the wiki server. I'll take a look at it, see what's what.

The problem isn't permissions. The problem is that protection doesn't
seem to be actually doing anything. Checking Special:ProtectedPages
tells me that no pages are protected, even when I just protected one.

Could this be related to the merger? Was something turned off or
forgotten, or not working? When was the last time we updated MediaWiki
anyway? Hmm.

Thanks for looking into this.

If you're talking about the password merger, then I think not. I recall 
attempting to protect the wp-config pages some time ago, and don't think 
it worked then, either.

If you're talking about some other merger, then no idea ;)

No, not related to the merger.

This is going to take longer than I thought. It's not a quick fix. I'm
having to delve into the innards of Mediawiki, and I don't know it all
that well.

For now, page protection doesn't work. Sorry. Can't help it. I'll look
at it and figure it out when I can.

Didn't mean the password merger. Was talking about the merger into
WordPress.org. Sorry I wasn't more specific. Maybe "the other" Matt
might remember something, or ask MichaelH as he did extensive research
into updating Mediawiki for the Codex.
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MichaelH Bet he might know.

Well, I determined that the protections are going into the database
correctly, they're just not showing up on the protected page lists in
MediaWiki, which suggests a core MW problem of some sort, or possibly
some extension breaking things.

Still investigating it. Having to learn MediaWiki as well. It strikes
me as more than a little psychotic. ;)
