The weird overlapping sidebar CSS bug some of you IE6 users may have  
seen on codex has been fixed.

The codex pages also now validate and expand nicely to any width screen.

Oh, excellent. Thank you. This has been SO annoying. The footer still is 
too high on a little post content page. AND the Views and Toolbox 
appearing in a new right column is still weird as that means the page 
isn't very representative of what the reader sees, which is MOST 
important when laying out images and information. It should be in the 
left column.

And THANK YOU for removing the double lines under the links. They looked 
like ad links. ;-)

I noticed a lot of articles in the Codex have their titles starting
with "WordPress". For example, "WordPress Coding Standards".

I know this is really nitpicky, but does anybody else think this is
slightly redundant? I mean, codex.wordpress.org already has WordPress
in the URL, and not to mention the large WordPress logo at the top of
the Codex (unless you use the monobook theme like me because the edit
links don't show up for you). Isn't that enough WordPress?

I suggest we simply drop "WordPress" from the titles, e.g. in the case
of "WordPress Coding Standards", rename to "Coding Standards".

Strange, I remember putting it in the Codex New Page Creation
Guidelines page under the "title" section that the word "WordPress"
should not be used in titles as it is redundant - there has been a
discussion about this before, back when we were building the Codex. I
can't find it now - must have been edited out or something.

Yes, this is a no-brainer as far as I am concerned- title should not
have "WordPress" in them.

Oh well, I just added it to [[Codex:Guidelines]]:

I'm glad you agree with me. Whenever I stumble across such an article,

Well there is nothing wrong with reinforcing the wordpress brand in users 
minds. what if someone saves that particular page as a bookmark? they can 
refer to it easily without trying to remember what the coding standards 
apply to. we know as creatives, our brains sometimes blink out...

That is not a problem. When you rename a page, the old title remains 
around as a link to the new page, perhaps forever.

However, can you want to start changing titles until some consensus is 
reached? One person posted a gripe, and one person answered that he 
agreed, so far.

I personally prefer titles like "WordPress Lessons" over "Lessons" 
(seems more specific and friendly somehow). Also "WordPress Coding 
Standards" makes it clear that the coding standards apply to all of 
WordPress (as opposed to Theme Coding Standards, Plugin Coding 
Standards, etc.). "Getting Started with WordPress" rather than 
"Getting Started" -- makes it clear that it is not going to cover how 
to get started with blogging in general, acquire web hosting, etc.

Just my 2 cents...

I agree with Jennifer on all points.

Also I think that search engines will rank the pages higher for search 
phrases like "wordpress coding standards" if all of the words appear in 
the title.

I think the point that Ehi was trying to make was that bookmarks
inherit the title of the webpage, and so future bookmarkers will get
only "coding standards" as opposed to "wordpress coding standards" -
its a valid point.

I suppose no consensus has been reached as to changing titles yet :)

Well, in that case, barring a few pages, every page on the Codex will
need to have "wordpress" in the title - example: WordPress Template
Tags". Coding standards for wordpress (whether "core" files or
templates or theme files) are the same now. How about using just
"Getting Started" if you are talking about WordPress, which is likely
the more common case on a WordPress documentation site, and using
"Getting Started with CuteFTP" if you dealing with exceptions, like,
in this case, CuteFTP?

Let me try and make my point this way - very rarely do you find
corporate pages with the title "About Corporate-Entity-Name". If you
are at some entity's webpage, then you know that already - no need to
repeat that again.

We should be thinking of reducing redundancy, and making title more
effective - thus, instead of "WordPress for Beginners" - could we have
an action word, or a descriptive noun instead of WordPress? - What
about "Tips for Beginners" or better still "Resources/RoadMap for
Beginners"?

I think I need not invoke Occam's razor now ;) I think it is better
that titles remain short, concise and to the point.

To me, using WordPress in page title implies a general lack of
inventiveness, and adds unnecessary flak in the form of redundant
words to the title. "WordPress" is already there is the URL -
codex.wordpress.org. That should keep the search engines happy.

We are "advanced" users, who see it as redundant. let us not forget the 
growing community of new users, who will appreciate the reminder

sometimes too much "effectiveness" destroys the intended effect; to help 
people use wordpress. the titles aid that. and that is the whole point, no?

Well, like I asked, where do you stop adding "WordPress" in the title, then?
It is good to have defined practices and follow them - recall rates go
higher... when I was an active support volunteer and documentor, I
used to remember many codex urls - based on the logical structure and
minimality of URLs. If you were to add WordPress to all the title,
that would solve this problem - albeit in a wasteful way (in my
opinion).

I honestly don't see how adding "WordPress" to title will help remind
people they are the wordpress codex, or that the article deals with
WordPress.

Also, too much effectiveness can't be but most effective - by definition. :)

when can we see a diminishing return on effectiveness? hard to know.

I would rather use our collective resources into making wordpress an even 
better tool than it already is, than using Monday morning's freshly squeezed 
creative juice for the "most effective titles ever" task.

I am being tongue-in-cheek. I am a frustrated writer...

In regards to search engines, that is not actually true. No one really 
knows exactly what the algorithms are for Google (or any other search 
engine), but the general consensus in the SEO community is that if 
someone searches for particular keywords, the order the results appear 
is based on some combination of (a) page title (with a higher weight 
given to words earlier in the title) (b) URL (c) words appearing in 
text of the page, with the most weight on H1, less for H2, etc. (d) 
the site's overall credibility ranking (based on in-bound and 
out-bound links).

So actually, if the objective is to ensure that codex articles appear 
with the highest possible rank in search results when people search 
for things such as "wordpress themes", the page titles should all 
start with WordPress (this could be done by adjusting the page 
template, of course).

Anyway, I still don't think a hard-and-fast rule about not having 
WordPress in page titles is really necessary or a good idea. What are 
you going to call the "Working with WordPress" article, for instance? 
"Working"? That makes no sense to me. And it is NOT true that 
corporate "About" pages do not have the company name in the page title.

The use of WordPress is intentional. It should NOT be in the guidelines 
NOT to use it. It is for keyword search and specific title references. 
When it is overkill, then don't use it, but it should be in things like 
"WordPress Lessons" and "Installing WordPress" and titles similar to 
that. It's appropriate usage.

When we work on the Codex, we're intimately involved with every nuance 
and become sensitive to these things. When people use the Codex, they 
are there for the few minutes it takes to get the answers, not 
nitpicking over the titles. If the title helps them track down the 
problem, then they go for it. It also helps with those who save the 
links to bookmarking services and such to say "WordPress" in the title 
and not just "Installation". Make sense?

Think this through to how the user uses the Codex. Let the page title 
stand but you can change the title when linking within the Codex if the 
"WordPresses" bother you.

All APPROPRIATE usages. That's the key.

Looking at that list, sure you are overwhelmed with all the WordPresses. 
But the user doesn't see that. They see "WordPress Function Reference" 
in their bookmark or saved resource links and remembers that this is the 
Function References for WordPress. Not much good "Function Reference" 
would do anyone as it sounds like a list of body functions or something 
weird.

My only point is that if this is true, then a lot of pages which don't
have WordPress should, like the Template_tags page, for one.

Oh well, I am sure we all know what's best for the collective - let's
not worry about the nitty-gritty :)

In the past too (if anyone checked out the thread I posted a link to)
the agreement seemed to be that one has to make a judicious decision
when, and when not to use WordPress in the page title. I have no
issues with that - not that my opinion matters the least bit now that
I am not active anymore. Let the titles not stop you from useful work.

Jeremy - since you were the one with the original question, I hope it
is at least a little clearer why we do what we do with respect to
having "WordPress" in the titles.

Have a good day, all,

Carthik.

    WordPress Coding Standards ? WordPress Codex

If we change it to Coding Standards:

    Coding Standards ? WordPress Codex

It still has WordPress in the title.
