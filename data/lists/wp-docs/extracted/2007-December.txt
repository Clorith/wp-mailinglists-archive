You are correct, it would be good if the new function to use was 
indicated. Some of the deprecated functions in the codex have been 
marked with this, and some haven't. If you figure out which function 
should be used, please edit the codex page and add that to the 
documentation.

You can also mark the page as "in need of editing" in the codex, and 
put a "talk" item explaining it needs a reference to the new function 
to use.

The Codex is a continual "work in progress" and a volunteer effort. I 
believe it is improving, but it can improve faster if you help. By the 
way, the "docs" mailing list is the correct venue for this discussion, 
not "hackers".

Thanks,
     Jennifer

*sigh*

This is exactly what the "Replace With" heading was added for, an 
example of which is:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_category_head#Replace_With

As Jennifer noted, it would have been nice if these had been marked as 
"in need of editing." Se la wiki...

Over the next day I'll see about making sure all *newer* deprecated 
functions are so listed with correct replacement info.

Cheers,
