Subject: [wp-docs] Error on "Localizing WordPress" page
Message-ID: <d0ae1f9b6a8339720b5ea4906e06611d@myrealbox.com>

I would like to correct an error in the Codex's instructions about how  
to localize WordPress. This error apparently causes many people to  
register WordPress projects on Launchpad when they shouldn't.  
<https://launchpad.net/projects/?text=wordpress> Probably it also means  
WordPress isn't being localized as much as it could be.

However, for the past couple of years, I have not been able to log in  
to the Codex. And when I ask it to e-mail me my password, it never  
does. So someone else will need to fix it. :-)

The error is in  
<http://codex.wordpress.org/ 
Localizing_WordPress#Translating_With_Launchpad>. The seven steps  
should be replaced by three:

     1.  Go to <https://launchpad.net/wordpress/2.1/+pots/wordpress>.

     2.  Choose "Log In / Register" at the top right, and log in with
         your Launchpad account (or create one if you don't have one
         already).

     3.  Choose a language to begin translating.

The URL in step 1 should be updated whenever a new version of WordPress  
is released.

Thanks

By reverse psychology (posting the above message), I tricked the Codex 
into coughing up a new password for me. So I've now edited the page 
myself. Sorry for the noise.
