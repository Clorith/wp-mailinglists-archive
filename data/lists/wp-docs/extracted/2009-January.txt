Hello,

I sent a copy of this message to the WP-Hackers list for reference. 
Let's keep further discussion on the Documentation list, please.

Thank you.

It started as a simple script with a few dozen lines that only I would
ever use to skip over common sections in the Codex and blossomed into a
multi-file, thousand line behemoth one long weekend. I didn't want to
disclose it in its current condition. It's pretty slim on documentation.
I did send Chris Jean a copy of it, however.

== Function Pages Planning ==

I just read the December Archives on the Hackers list. It looks like
there is some interest there by real life programmers and hackers who
are more familiar with the WordPress code and PHP than I am. Together we
should be able to come up with an easy to update version of the codex on
both a sample site and in the Codex Function Reference.

Hopefully we will use the inline documentation you started as our
starting point and provide updates for it as we move forward.


== Function Pages Progress ==

I intend to continue adding new function reference pages to the Codex
while we discuss implementation of future Codex Function Reference
pages. I'd like to see something up on the Codex rather than nothing
until we sort out the details. So, the planning phase shouldn't hold up
the action phase. We will just have to do some back-tracking later on.

I added about 82 new function pages in December. I hope to add more in
January. Wish us luck and perseverance. We'll need both.


Have A Happy New Year,

Charles Clarkson

Well, like I said, If you get it started, then I'll join in and walk 
beside you on your journey to achieving enlightenment. I would rather 
join in once I have time and I can contribute something that would only 
take a few hours or so a week. I'd be happy to add a few examples and 
improve the details, but that would mean that the page already exists.

Your script will hopefully carefully update the existing codex pages and 
not replace everything. The examples should always be applicable, unless 
there is a regression or the specs change.

Good luck.

Excellent list, just remember, DO NOT custom style the DL tags. Those are a
mistake and will be fixed and I'd hate to undo any custom stuff you've done
while waiting for those styles to be fixed.

@Charles: Thanks for the input, too.

Anyone else have any Codex Style requests and fixes to add to the list? I'm
so excited we're finally going to get this all cleaned up!

It looks like the effort does worth it. Although it's not quite what I
expected or wanted it to be.

I still think (and as it turned out - I'm not the only one who does),
that user contributions in form of regular comments are very
important. Many interesting things at php.net are found in comments
and not in a description of a function itself. Comments may become a
base for wiki entry. As I said, users make comments more easily then
they write structured articles.

I respect Charles and what he does right now, but I do not see how I
can help. Perl is not my strong point and hence I can't contribute to
the parser-script. The only thing I can do in established context is
to edit texts on Function Reference page. Or, and that's more logical,
I should start editing inline documentation?.. Maybe we should remove
Codex Editing ability from Function Reference Part? Or somehow connect
it with inline documentation? Otherwise we will again get two
different and independent versions of documentation.

I'm new to wp-docs, so that I haven't got a single letter from it yet
for this conversation. Can anyone post anything, so that I could post
a response to a corresponding thread?

The idea isn't to replace all user-contributed content with a team of 
Perl scripts. Rather, the idea is to use the scripts to help expedite a 
complete overhaul of the core information while creating consistent 
results. People manually adding examples, additional information on 
usage nuances, crosslinks with relevant Codex pages, notes, etc will 
still be crucial.

As for wanting people to post things that you can respond to, I'm not 
sure what you are asking for there.

As for the explanation as to why the comments are used is that usually 
are from people who don't have a php.net email account and don't want to 
or don't know how to submit a patch or ticket to correct the 
documentation. Also it is normally faster in any case to add a comment 
then it is to wait for the documentation page to be updated. Usually, 
any corrections in the comments that pertain to the documentation are 
usually just fixed and committed by those approving the comments.

Regardless, most of what the comments handles on php.net can just be 
dealt with by clicking on "edit" and modifying the text directly. For 
the other half, the discussion page can work, however, I suppose the 
complaint with that, is that you have to check it manually instead of 
being able to go down on the page to see. Therefore, you can probably 
assume that if "comments" were added to the discussion page, then most 
people will not be looking at it. Unless of course, the documentation 
doesn't make something clear, and then some of those will check the 
discussion to complain about the lack of information or clarity.

What's happened to the codex menus?  Everything seems to have jumped 
over to the right hand side of the page, so now instead of the "home 
page" link being fairly obviously positioned, it's half-way down the 
right-hand menu.

Recent Changes is even worse, it used to be fairly accessible but now 
it's off the bottom of the screen.

Is this intended to be a final layout?  I don't think that it helps with 
Codex user-friendliness.

Seriously.  All the meta navigation is stuffed down the right hand side 
in one big list.

I'm sure it used to be better set-out than that.  I didn't have to 
scroll 1.5 pages to get to "recent changes".  Pretty sure it was on the 
LHS.

No need to list them.

Bernard -

I believe mrmist is referring to this version of the Codex, which is 
showing the menu now on the right, as opposed to the left side where it 
used to be:

http://codex.wordpress.org/

What is the link to what you posted a screenshot of?

Ahh, ok.

It's skin dependant.  Until 2 minutes ago I didn't realise there were 
skins.

However, only the codex (default) is WordPress branded, the rest seem 
somewhat half-baked.  (Un)fortunately only codex (default) is broken.

     Why rely on the web page navigation? Bookmark it in your browser.

     I have a Projects button on my Firefox toolbar. I click on the 
button and a drop-down menu appears. The Codex folder has all my most 
visited destinations on the Codex.

     When I'm uploading and editing function pages in the Codex I like 
to have certain tabs open every time. In Firefox, I created a folder 
under the Codex folder mentioned above with bookmarks to these pages. At 
the bottom of the menu for that folder is an "Open All in Tabs" option. 
I click on that menu option and all the tabs I want open for me. No 
muss. No Fuss.

     Web page designers change layouts based on customer complaints and 
     other input. There are a few marketing groups which do tests to see 
what the average user wants and what turns them away. Frequent users are 
rarely average users. There is a constant trade-off between pleasing 
existing users and attracting new users.

     Still, I find the squeaky wheel gets the oil.

The Codex is in the process of design changes. Hang on and be patient. We've
been waiting for a LONG time for this.

The menus were supposed to be on the left, but they are now both on the
right. Oh, well, it still is much improved. Before, it had menus on the left
for everyone, and then a menu on the right when logged in, which squished
the editing/content area. We needed to have them on only one side so allow
the widest area for content and code.

I'm thrilled with what I see now, and we're on the right track. I posted a
note on this mailing list a couple weeks ago inviting people to submit their
CSS style requests to fix the design, so you are welcome to comment on that
thread and add your thoughts to the content design elements.

I'm looking forward to getting the Codex finally cleaned up. This is so
exciting!

Thanks WordPress team!

You don't say.

Sooooo I musta been in the grips of some profound delusion when I made those
screenshots, saved those screenshots, uploaded those screenshots, and posted
about those screenshots.

OpenSource projects leave me feeling schizophrenic.
And I ain't.
(Gawd, the early days of Mozilla were like end-to-end horror movies.)

You're obviously trolling, since you seem intelligent enough to either 
have read the full thread before making assertions that were answered in 
said thread.

Your first screenshot was probably a mistake with the template either 
having an error and reverting back to the original or some modification 
that went awry.

Your second screenshot is what the Codex is supposed to look like, so no 
problem there.

You seem to assert that there is some problem with the second 
screenshot. I will counter with the argument above and that since the 
look is intentional that there is nothing wrong. If you do not like the 
design, then there is no reason to give grieve to those who agree with 
you that having the navigation on the right is problematic.

I would give it some time. It is obvious also a work in progress, so 
allow Lorelle to beat the "Other Matt" down to fix the template (For 
some reason I want to use "Thompson" for the surname, I guess because 
that has always been my alias for forms that I don't want to give my 
real name to).

Chill. There is a difference between being an asshole and being a wrong 
asshole. The first is acceptable within certain constraints (hell, I'm 
often both) and the latter is never acceptable. It is better to play it 
safe and be "nice". How you want to define that is up to you.

I replied to items and then replied to responses after that.

I don't have a clue what you're talking about.
Which strikes me as just plain sad.

These personalitly games suck.

"Trolling" my ass.

> Your first screenshot was probably a mistake with the template either

Absolutely no clue what you're on about.
What shows in the first screenshot is a totally normal wiki skin.

What was said (if you read) was that the sidebar was on the left.
What I saw was that it was on the right.

How stupid am I?
I took a screenshot, uploaded, and posted.

I'm supposed to apologize for that?
You're nutz.

> Your second screenshot is what the Codex is supposed to look like,
> so no problem there.
Exactly.

So when someone said it was a problem with skins I took that screenshot.
The ToC may not be exactly where I'd like it, but otherwise it's fine.

I have no clue what you're on about.

Apparently those little black squiggly things on the screen (letters) only
matter to you when they're from a pal!

Fine.
I said what you said.
Perhaps some day you'll do me the courtesy of responding to those actualities.

Can you be honest?
For a moment?
Even though I haven't sucked up to anybody here?

Where, pray tell (This is totally f**d) where did I give anybody any "grief"?
Execpt in my response to Lorelle's totally patronizing contempt?

So let's be straight: suck up or STFU ...
... did I get that just about right?

And please, spare me the dramatic fictions.

You know ... words?

> Chill.
Screw you.

I'm outta here

WordPress project is just a children's insane asylum.

     One person's sidebar is another person's content. The content of 
the Main Page is a list of links, not a sidebar. The TOC is on the right 
of the content and the menu is on the far right.

Ah, now I understand. Thanks for translating. For some reason, the
code to hide the TOC on the front page of the Codex, or any page on
the Codex, is __NOTOC__ and it was removed for some reason. It
shouldn't be on the front page, but it should be on all the pages, but
you can control where it goes by putting in __TOC__ where you want it
to appear. It will automatically appear at the top (on the right) of
any page in the Codex with headings. We often moved it lower if we put
code or an image at the top of the page so it wouldn't squish the
content.

I was looking on the other pages on the Codex, not the front page
specifically. Thanks for clearing that up!

All fixed.

Bernard was not trolling. He's a valuable member of our documentation
team. Sorry you haven't had a chance to get to know his humor before
slamming. He's doing great work and exploring thoroughly WordPressMU
and development documentation, which is desperately needed here.

Come on folks, let's all lighten up. I'm here at WordCamp Las Vegas
getting ready to meet some awesome WordPress folks, and trying to
understand what happened with the Codex and what everyone is saying.

I've fixed the front page. I looked at the screenshots and then went
to the Codex (any page) and saw it was changed. YEAH! CHEERS for the
WordPress team to finally help us. I was so excited about that, I
didn't look into the details to see that the table of contents
accidentally appeared on the front page, the real page that was of
concern. I'm in between meetings and greetings, so I was the careless
one with that. My replies were meant to be helpful, and a little
silly, so pardon if they were taken personally. I'm giddy that the
Codex is being worked on - in any direction.

Before things go down the drain, remember, we are all volunteers here
trying to do our best. We rely upon the WordPress staff to help run
the code under the hood, and we should all be cheering that the Codex
is finally starting to look so good.

I started a thread a week or two ago asking for more input on what
needs fixing in the styles on the Codex, and maybe everyone didn't get
it, but now work is at hand and your input is desired and much
appreciated. As work continues to improve the design, there will be
changes as part of the construction. Consider yourselves all warned.
It's going to be great, but have patience.

And while we're trying to lighten the load, I'm usually the first in
line to use "potty mouth" (nephews call it that) language and name
calling, so please, leave that to me and let's use sir and madam the
rest of the time. :D

And let's get back to helping the WordPress Community get the
information they need to help them blog better. It takes all of our
creative and unique talents to make the Codex possible, and the
unappreciated gem that it is. Thanks all for all of your hard work.

And again, my apologies for the confusion. I screwed up.

I took a screenshot of RecentChanges: it's self-evident as to location. It even
includes date and approximatge time. (In case someone couldn't be bothered to
read the page title.)
And still people were unclear as to which page it was. One guy actually asked
me. In perfectly good English. Clearly. "What page is that a picture of."

So ... if that screenshot is ambiguous ... I dunno.
Like I say, these projects leave me feeling distinctly schiz.

In order to get everyone on the same page, Ben is using a different skin 
(Classic rather than Codex) on his Codex view. It's the same site, 
different skin. So, he sees a different site layout than most of the 
rest of us are looking at.

This was quickly noticed and handled by mrmist, and that should have 
been the end of the confusion.


Ben,

Jacob may have been quick to call you a troll, but you have been very 
vocal, extremely rude, and quick to judgment yourself when it was you 
who made the mistaken assumption (that you too would see the changes 
even though you are using a non-default skin). Rather than trying to 
figure out why seemingly everyone else couldn't understand what you were 
talking about, you proceeded to believe that everyone was an idiot, that 
open source projects are a tragedy, and that you are being crapped on. A 
wisdom I learned a while back applies here: If it seems like everyone 
around me is horribly wrong, it's more likely that I've misunderstood 
something and that I'm actually the one that is wrong. This wisdom is 
extremely valuable in the technical field.

Just so you know what we are seeing, this is what I see while using the 
default skin: http://tinyurl.com/7ev65h

As you can see, the changes that everyone have been talking about are on 
this skin and not on your's. If you wish to continue discussing changes 
to the Codex layout, I recommend that you change your skin to default.


Everyone,

Frankly, I think that this could have been handled better by everyone. 
Most of the response I've seen in this thread have been laced with 
assumptions and incomplete thoughts. Even if you know 100% that people 
know exactly what you are talking about, it always helps to provide a 
link to the page that is being discussed. It also helps to note whether 
or not your are logged in and if you see any differences when you are 
logged in or not logged in. Using full, detailed sentences for both 
questions and responses helps cut off spiraling circles of confusion 
like this.

Screenshots are a great tool. I think if Ben had been provided with a 
screenshot of what we see earlier that this mess could have been much 
smaller. So maybe another good practice is to always send a link to a 
screenshot if the discussion is about site layout/design issues.

I'm not sure that this is relevant to this thread, but in general, the 
following is also good practice to prevent confusion: Keep in mind that 
while English is the language used on this list, not everyone is from 
the same region/country/part of the world that you are. English is very 
diverse, as such, using abundant detail to describe things can help 
people that have a different usage of English or use English as a 
secondary language.

Good point. I assumed that skin changed nothing funtional i.e. that sidebars and
menus would be the same for both.

I notice you don't quote or cite, while making accusations and distorting the
truth.

In fact and actually there wasn't the slightest wiff of conflict in this thread.

I'm sure Jacob appreciates your un-reasoned support.
I sure don't.

I'll let you get back to your games now.

Here are the messages I wrote in this thread ... the stuff that supposedly gave
rise to "take your meds" ... not my reaction to that, note. The basis. Not the
response, but what Chris Jean depicts as the proximate cause.

I made no judgments, I posted 2 screenshots to buttress the discussion, and I
threw no shit.
But that's not good enough for the the sophists.

*shrug*
Personality politics and mind games ...

You don't say.

Sooooo I musta been in the grips of some profound delusion when I made those
screenshots, saved those screenshots, uploaded those screenshots, and posted
about those screenshots.

OpenSource projects leave me feeling schizophrenic.
And I ain't.
(Gawd, the early days of Mozilla were like end-to-end horror movies.)

p.s. Don't worry about me; all I do is bring back memories SigInt / NORAD/SAC /

It wasn't until after I posted my reply to the initial request for help that
I saw that mrmist has stepped in and cleaned it up. These mailing lists are
great, but the timeliness is sometimes off. Thanks mrmist for helping
resolve this.

And thanks for your calm voice, Chris.

Once again, thanks to the WordPress team for fixing the styles in the Codex.
Input is still being requested if anyone on the documentation team has more
recommendations. I've been waiting for these so I can clean up the Table of
Contents for the whole Codex. I've been doing a lot of sorting and cleaning,
and have a long list of things to do with the Codex, so I'm eager to get it
looking great, so we can move forward with the incorporation of new videos,
screencasts, guides, and updates.

Apologies for not speaking out sooner (my day's been busy!)

The codex is in a little bit of a flux. I've been working with Lorelle  
and Matt Thomas to get some bugs squashed and some layout issues taken  
care of - but it's a bit of a process.

We're still debating on how to handle the sidebar, but for now, a two  
column design allows better readability than the three column layout  
before. I can see arguments for both, but I believe with a better  
organized sidebar, the two column layout will prevail.

Hugs, Love, WordPress, Repeat.

Yep.  I've absolutely no issues with a two-column layout.  I only 
mentioned it really in case it was actually broken somehow.  The bits 
that got me were firstly that the "home page" bit got lost (there's no 
section head and ideally I think it would be at the top) and that I 
wasn't expecting to be over the right hand side for the recent activity.

I suppose it depends on what the aim is, but one thing I would consider 
is that the menu in WordPress itself has migrated from top to left, not 
top to right.  It might be nice to keep some UI consistency.(By which I 
mean keep the menu on the left.)   Obviously though everyone will have 
their own view.  It's not massively important.

Subject: [wp-docs] RFC: New Global Variables page for the Function Reference
Message-ID: <49753C47.5080602@htcomp.net>

Hello,

     I would like to add a new page to the Function Reference on the 
Codex about WordPress Global Variables. There are a few lists around the 
web, but no full list in the Codex documentation.

     I explain some of my reasoning in a rough draft [1]. Mainly I want 
to have a single location to point to from the Codex Function Reference 
pages for each global variable.

     The Source Code Documentation Parser (The Parser) will 
automatically add links to the appropriate sections of this page to most 
global declarations.

     Hopefully, this will allow programmers to add notes in the source 
code about a particular global variable usage while allowing the Codex 
to automatically refer to more detailed information about that variable.

     The Parser adds globals that are not defined by the Inline 
Documentation (probably because the programmer didn't think them 
important), but that are included in the function to the Codex Function 
Reference Page. So, there is a need for a good definition in the Codex.


     Is anyone else working on this?

     Can you see any room for improvement?


     The new page would reside at:
     http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/Global_Variables.

web, but no full list in the Codex documentation.

     I explain some of my reasoning in a rough draft [1]. Mainly I want 
to have a single location to point to from the Codex Function Reference 
pages for each global variable.

     The Source Code Documentation Parser (The Parser) will 
automatically add links to the appropriate sections of this page to most 
global declarations.

     Hopefully, this will allow programmers to add notes in the source 
code about a particular global variable usage while allowing the Codex 
to automatically refer to more detailed information about that variable.

     The Parser adds globals that are not defined by the Inline 
Documentation (probably because the programmer didn't think them 
important), but that are included in the function to the Codex Function 
Reference Page. So, there is a need for a good definition in the Codex.


     Is anyone else working on this?

     Can you see any room for improvement?


     The new page would reside at:
     http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/Global_Variables.

Subject: [wp-docs] Singleton Glossary Term
Message-ID: <4975C8B9.7020202@santosj.name>

After getting my ass spanked on my own blog for screwing up [2] the 
definition for Singleton, I've decided to fix the Glossary Term [1]. It 
is interesting that class patterns would be part of the WordPress Codex, 
figuring that while most class patterns are possible in PHP4, it is 
usually not as well defined as it should be by using an language that 
actually supports the proper constructs to implement the pattern correctly.

If anyone wants to rewrite the glossary term to remove the erroneous 
example(s), then they can be my guest.

Why not remove it from the glossary?

It's not a term you find in even infrequent use among the WordPress 
community. A correct definition might only confuse things just as much. 
Do we even have an example of the Singleton pattern in use in the WP 
framework?

Corrected the definition of Singleton to be:

"Singletons are objects that exist globally and are the only one of their 
class; if one instance of a class is created per request, this instance is a 
singleton object. "

No. Singleton is not an object, it is a class pattern.

"Singletons are objects that exist globally and are the only one of 
their class." - Is correct

The rest is not. The Singleton class pattern puts constraints on exactly 
how many instances can be created, not the total number that are 
created, if that was the case then the majority of objects in WordPress 
would be Singletons because they are only created once. There are no 
Singletons in the WordPress library, actual all of the WordPress class 
library follows the normal object practices.

Searching Google for "Singleton object" only comes up with the Pattern. 
The Singleton is a pattern not an object, if anything it is a class 
methodology.

My worry at first is whether or not this page should be in the root rather
than as a sub page under Functions, a minor technicality in Codex structure.
If it is that integrated into Functions, then a sub page is appropriate. If
it is really its own subject and a key part of building functions and more,
then it needs to be its own page.

What do you think?

Message-ID: <fded39850901201047k4a54e0f4x2c41386627f35647@mail.gmail.com>

Some of you may have heard Matt Mullenweg's announcement at WordCamp Las
Vegas of the WordPress Handbook, a free online manual for WordPress users. I
chatted with him about the future of WordPress documentation, the WordPress
Codex, and this new handbook.

First, the WordPress Handbook is NOT a replacement for the Codex. The
handbook will be the essence of a basic manual for using WordPress. The
Codex may actually expand to cover everything outside of the core essentials
for using WordPress. For now, it will continue to be the source of
information for developers and core functions.

The WordPress Handbook will begin with a very basic "How to Use WordPress"
core that guides the user through installation, upgrades, and basic user
functions like how to write a post, upload images, embed multimedia, install
Plugins and Themes, and the core functionality of using WordPress. Much of
it will use Codex content regarding those tasks and the WordPress
Administration Panels.

A "design and customization" version will include tips on choosing a
WordPress Theme and Plugin, installing, customizing and tweaking.

A developer version will follow to help Theme and Plugin authors and third
party apps to hook into WordPress to add features and functionality.

The WordPress Handbooks will not be in wiki form. They will be created using
Subversion. An example is the http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ Version Control
with Subversion by Ben Collins-Sussman, Brian W. Fitzpatrick, C. Michael
Pilato.

The handbook will be in XML form tied to Subversion (SVN), allowing easy
updating for version specific issues within the documentation, linking to
the online handbook directly from WordPress based upon version, branching
into version specific guides. It will also include options for HTML and PDF
versions, and the ability to submit patches and updates just as is currently
being done with WordPress and many other programs. The idea is to keep the
handbook updated and current with the latest version of WordPress, as well
as past versions, while continuing to allow community participation and
"proofing" for checks and balances in the documentation.

The WordPress Handbook will continue to follow in the footsteps of its
predecessors as an open source project under the GPL. Some staff may be
hired or given responsibility to implement and oversee the project, but it
will be community driven, allowing anyone to submit changes and additions
through the Subversion repository.

Matt is working on the fundamental programming and process for which to
start integrating appropriate Codex and original WordPress 2.7 specific
content into the handbook. We'll be calling upon the WordPress Codex
documentation team to help us update and choose what information "must" be
in the handbooks, as well as updating the Codex. Calls will be put out to
the WordPress Community for recommendations on content and topics as well,
letting their needs guide the final choices.

The handbooks must service basic beginners to intermediate users, which
means the Codex may become the historical repository and technical guide
beyond the handbook. The writing style will be different from the Codex in
keeping with a basic manual rather than a guide.

The Handbook will be a major shift for those used to the Codex and Mediawiki
who wish to contribute, especially for those with no experience with
Subversion. We'll be writing up guidelines and tips for submitting content
and patches, as well as a style guide, on the Codex.

Here are some links to help you familiarize yourself with how Subversion,
and the example of the free online Subversion book, works:

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ Version Control with Subversion by Ben
Collins-Sussman, Brian W. Fitzpatrick, C. Michael Pilato
http://www.open.collab.net/community/subversion/svnbook/ - Open Collab.net

http://www.open.collab.net/community/subversion/svnbook/svn.preface.organization.htmlOpen
Collab.net version of the organizational structure of the SVN book and
how to use Subversion
http://code.google.com/p/svnbook/issues/list
http://svn.red-bean.com/svnbook/trunk/
http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596004484/ - the printed book
http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html - using subversion
http://osdir.com/ml/version-control.subversion.book/ - mailing list for the
Version Control Subversion book

If you have any links on the step-by-step process of using Subversion as a
manual or book, please let us know.

Again, this is not the end of the WordPress Codex. This is an exciting shift
for WordPress documentation. This is the start of a conversation about where
the Codex is going, and what key content should be in the handbook. We'll
have information on the technical process soon.

For now, we need to start work updating the Codex for WordPress 2.7,
including adding new screenshots, screencasts, incorporating the technical,
how-to videos from WordPress.tv, creating our own short, technical videos,
and continuing the tremendous work of so many volunteers within the
WordPress Community to offer technical and reference material to WordPress
users.

Sounds interesting.  I wonder are there any plans to somehow 
programmatically link the content of the handbook with the (same areas 
of) content in the Codex?  If so, great.  If not, I think that's 
something that should be given serious consideration, so as to avoid 
duplication of work, and potentially conflicting sources of info.  I 
expect it would be some great programming feat to accomplish, mind.

Does that mean the manual will actually be outputted on relevant pages in
that 'Help' dropdown? That would be pretty cool :)

The Handbook will link to expanded information in the Codex, when
appropriate, as that is a natural function of the two, I'm sure. After all,
instead of code it will be content, and there will be links to appropriate
and related content within the documentation of the Handbook.

And I agree. This is VERY cool and has a lot of potential for integration
within the WordPress Administration Panels as well as a "stand alone book."
We get a lot of requests for a printed version of the Codex, and the SVN
Handbook will have that feature built in, though I'd hate to think of all
the wasted paper if they printed out the WHOLE thing. :D

There is a lot of work that has to go into the integration of the content
into Subversion, and creation of forms for us to add and patch content in
documentation style rather than strictly code, but the Subversion book has
already laid the groundwork and we have a lot to learn from their past
mistakes. It's back to the books, folks. :D

I'm very excited about this next step. We have a LOT of work on the Codex to
do, along side the Handbook development, so let's get cracking!

Three words:

Cool Cool Cool.

Doing it in the style of the subversion book is going to be real cool.

I am looking forward to contributing.

     " ... And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore. Then 
the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!" :)

 > What do you think?

     The programmer in me convinced that Template Tags, Conditional Tags 
and Include Tags, filters and actions are actually functions and 
probably should not exist outside a Function Reference.

     (That is a problem for me. To go to the definition of is_new_day() 
without using Codex Search, I have to know that it is /not/ a 
Conditional Tag or a Template Tag, even though it looks and acts like 
one of those.)

     Since Template Tags, Conditional Tags and Include Tags do not fall 
under the Function Reference pages in the Codex, perhaps it would be 
better to place Global Variables on the same level.

     However, some existing pages dedicated to WordPress classes are 
tied very tightly with the definition of specific global variables.

     For Example:
     $wpdb       http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpdb_Class
     $wp_query   http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Query
     $wp_rewrite http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Rewrite

     Another question begs: Should WordPress Classes be under the 
Function Reference?

@tai - translations are the hope and could be much easier with this new

Imagine how easy it would be to submit patches to improve translation!

Umm,,, I'm not sure it would be easier for us translators, though, It
might be a good idea to have a web UI like Launchpad:
https://translations.launchpad.net/

Anyway, that's good to know, so I will be watching the list. :-)
Thank you very much, Lorelle!

I had to laugh, because I have like 6 or 7 patches for WordPress which 
haven't been committed yet and I'm still waiting. I also don't think you 
are being sarcastic, which I mean you know, it actually isn't too easy 
to have patches committed.

Yeah, it is super easy to submit patches, we'll have to see how quick 
the commit process is. It really depends on who is babysitting the 
repository and how many people have commit access. If one or two people 
from Automattic or outside entity have commit access, then I'll tell you 
right now, that it won't be easy, based upon the patch process for the 
WordPress Tests Repository. If they don't think your documentation 
correction is worth it, then you'll have made the patch for nothing.

If you do think that the patch is worth it, then you are going to have 
to battle to the death and debate those with commit access to death on 
the correction or addition. I really don't see a lot of people 
contributing to it, besides Automattic and a few other people. Really it 
depends on how they implement the patch system.

Translations will be easier and I think many in the translation team 
will contribute to those portions.

Hopefully we can have something really useful built to support the patch
creation/submissions process...

A web-based UI (a bit like Launchpad), where you didn't need any installed
software to create patches. The patches could then be added to a 'pending
approval' section, where users could vote on how good/useful they think the
patch is - therefore making it easy for people with commit access to see
which patches are the best/most wanted.

Also making it easy for people to see what needs adding to - perhaps having
hidden tags within the XML files like in the wiki 'stub' or 'needs work' etc
- these could then be filtered so somebody who knows a lot about a certain
thing can search for the pages which need updating/working on, that are
relevant to them.

I'm thinking tag clouds, filtering pages and voting mechanisms.

I'm trying to understand the problems that will be solved by creating
a Subversion-controlled manual.  The practical realities that make
Subversion such a helpful tool for software development are either not
present or already addressed with a wiki.  So for example, if the
Codex were overwhelmed by ideologues trying to reshape the Codex, or
if vandalism were a constant problem, then I could understand
tightening up control.

If the issue is a matter having professionals generate the content,
why not unleash those professional writers on the Codex?  The Codex
quality will improve all around, as you'd be combining the work of the
paid writers and volunteers who for the most part seem to know their
stuff.

> The writing style will be different from the Codex in keeping with a basic manual rather than a guide.

In practice the distinction between a "manual" and a "guide" is a very
fine line, one crossed in many places already in the Codex.  If that
distinction is the main issue, why not just supplement the Codex with
a "manual" section?

I'm concerned that this manual will have the effect of undermining the
perceived value of the Codex, which will mean fewer people will
consult it, and fewer volunteers will contribute both to the Codex and
to the manual (with its higher barrier of entry).  Of course,
potential deficits like that might be worthwhile in light of the
overall benefit, but I'm having difficulty seeing the benefit.

Why is it more fun to contribute using Subversion than a wiki?

Yeah that could be a concern really.  You only have to look at the 
wordpress trac, there's 340 tickets marked has-patch.  Some of them are 
3 years old.  If the manual goes that way it would get stale really 
quickly.

Part of the beauty of the wiki codex is that changes have instant 
feedback. You see something wrong, you fix it. Done.  That's pretty 
gratifying.  It's much less gratifying to do something and then see it 
languish.

I agree with the concerns Austin raised about the questionable benefit of
converting to Subversion rather than using a wiki format. I'm not even sure
how that would work. Each writer would need to check out a topic and then
check it back in, and then the whole thing would be compiled into a
book-like format? I haven't used Subversion before, so I'm unfamiliar with
it. If it requires too much ramping up to contribute, the contributions will
decrease.

I find the WordPress Codex a fascinating project, one that ideally I should
be actively contributing to but am not. My only contribution has been the
WordPress Quick Start Guide page,
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Quick_Start_Guide, which I felt was
sorely needed.

The technical communication community has made some progress in solving
problems that the Codex poses, but it goes a different route and employs a
technology called DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture). Ideally,
you would have a content management system based on the DITA architecture
that would enable multiple authors to create topics formatted in DITA that
could then be published in a variety of formats and deliverables. The CMS
would contain all topics. For a light guide, you would choose to include
only certain topics in your publication. But if you wanted to include it
all, you would map a table of contents including all topics. Additionally,
some companies are now creating DITA-to-wiki capabilities.

However, putting questions of technology aside, the larger problem with
WordPress' documentation is that, except for the recent screencast guy who
publishes release videos, the documentation effort seems to be mainly put in
the hands of the community. Isn't this a lot to ask of the community? I
think WordPress should hire a professional technical writer to manage the
entire project. I don't mean any disrepect to the documentation team with
this recommendation, only that this is too monumental of a task to leave
entirely up to the community to create and maintain.

The Manual is a concise, detailed explanation with a limited and defined 
set of topics. The Codex is a guide, which consists of topics which 
range from anything and everything, which are in some areas easy to find 
and others more difficult to find. The problem with the Codex, which the 
Manual will solve is that some topics have a lot of information and 
others have none or stub amount of information. In theory, the Manual 
will contain enough information to understand the concept and work off 
of it, but doesn't mean that it will contain all knowledge on that topic.

Therefore, the Manual will contain more concise, detailed information 
that pinpoint problem and solutions with the explanation with the topics 
it covers. The edge cases, will have to be covered on the Codex.

That is how I would see the Manual, if I were to write it. Also, look at 
the OpenX ad Manual system and what it contains vs what the Codex 
contains. In some areas, the information is a lot and covers what you 
need, but I've found that there are several areas where the information 
given is not enough or accurate enough, which the Codex would be better 
to explain.

IIRC Mozilla came up with a fairly formal solution to this problem:
someone (2 or 3?) had the task of de-languishing material,
sort of a cat herder.
I'd call it "ram-rod" but there was a better term that I don't
recall just now.

--Yes, that was part of the idea behind the help tab.



From: Austin Matzko <if.website@gmail.com>
I'm trying to understand the problems that will be solved by creating  
a Subversion-controlled manual.  The practical realities that make  
Subversion such a helpful tool for software development are either  
not present or already addressed with a wiki.

--I think there are a few benefits. Wikis aren't set up for the kind  
of navigation that the handbook could have. A lot of people find the  
Codex overwhelming and think it's hard to find things. Outdated  
information isn't marked as outdated until someone goes in and  
manually identifies it as relating to an earlier version. With a  
Subversion controlled manual, there could be a new copy with each  
release that is easier to bring up to date. (Ever tried to go through  
every Codex page? It is a major pain because of the way wikis are  
structured.) Sometimes I come across Codex pages that have been cut  
and pasted from others to take advantage of repeat information, but  
the paster forgot to do the small edits necessary to the pasted text,  
and the Codex page would actually be incorrect. A patch system would  
make it easier for an editorial team/technical writer/whomever to  
proofread submissions before they go live, identify duplicate  
content, etc. That instant change on the wiki is great when the info  
is accurate, but what about if it's a little bit off, poorly written,  
or ignores an already written explanation elsewhere in the Codex that  
the new contributor just didn't know about because of the way wiki  
navigation is structured? It's hard to keep tabs on everything in a  
wiki.

Also, as Lorelle mentioned, the Handbook is really meant to be more  
like the owner's manual for your camera or iPhone... get you enough  
information to get up and running and do basic troubleshooting, but  
not so much that it would overwhelm with technical details that  
mostly are useful to more advanced users.

Personally I think this move to Subversion and the model used by the
Subversion book is a great idea.  As a plugin developer I find the Codex
documentation cumbersome and I work offline a lot so having a real reference
book would be a huge benefit.  I actually have Adobe Acrobat walk the Codex
periodically just so I can have something to reference when I am not
connected.  I do a lot of work when I am on an airplane - offline
documentation is a big benefit for me  I always keep a PDF version of the
Subversion book on my laptop and found it so useful I ordered the printed
version from ORA.

Besides offline access, the biggest benefit I see is the ability to tag a
version of the documentation against a WordPress release.  Need to do some
work on 2.6.3?  You would reference the 2.6.3 SVN branch of the book.  No
need to worry about heading down a dead end path based on Codex content
which is only relevant to a newer release.  Right now there is very little
information in the Codex that helps you differentiate information which
changes from release to release.  The same is true for a Wiki.

Mike

Are those documentation only patches or do they change the code? Do you 
find your Inline Document changes take an equally long time to be committed?

I would guess (because I really don't know) that part of the hold up for
WordPress Trac is the testing process. Even automated testing can
produce a lot of problems which need to be examined.

In a handbook SVN I would guess that rigorous testing would be mostly
eliminated. I think the approval process needed to commit changes would
be the bottleneck.

It seems that changes to the handbook would be approved by some small
group of people. We have to assume an appreciable amount of effort will
not make it into the handbook, but I am not convinced it would be for
nothing. That same rejected work might fit in on the Codex.

A lot of people have been addressing concerns with the submission of content
to the SVN repo, and as I mentioned earlier a web-based editor would solve
this - allowing it to be as easy (if not easier) to add content just like
with the wiki. I like the idea of being able to tag documentation to a
release, and a dropdown to choose the relevant release would make that
functionality accessible.
What this comes down to is quality, SVN means a chosen few (maybe even
professionals in this field) could be employed to 'vet' or check each
submission, ensuring a better quality of content.

Also, as I mentioned previously, because the changes actually take the form
of a 'change' (technically a patch file), users can vote on the best
'changes' and the good additions make their way to the top of the commit
list.

Just my 2 cents on the whole thing,
Alex

Just because there's a patch for something doesn't mean it should be 
accepted.

Branching is one, for example when we do a release we can branch the 
handbook. It's been near-impossible to "version" the Codex for different 
releases of WP.

Another is that Docbook can easily output to many different formats, 
including CHM, and of course we could even do on-demand printed copies 
of the handbook. Printing out the whole Codex would be... harmful to our 
rain forests. :)

Spam is a constant problem, but that's a separate issue.

It's not an issue in my opinion.

I hope that things in the handbook will become the canonical resources 
for those parts of WP, just like we used to have certain important docs 
on WordPress.org.

You will have to forgive me for being somewhat disillusioned. I'm sure 
that if the same people that have commit access to the WordPress 
repository have commit access to the WordPress DocBook repository that 
there should be a pretty fast turnaround for patches. That would also 
mean that there would be around 5 to 7 people with commit access, which 
means more people who will be on the look out for committing patches.

The core team has been extremely good with committing documentation only 
patches (what? They don't break anything, so no testing). Whether there 
is a similar experience for this new repository is to be seen. I do hope 
that there is a quick commit turn-around for patches after a review. I 
shouldn't say it will be the experience given that it hasn't been 
released yet, so complaining is premature at this point. Well, there 
will be a wait period anyway, but I do hope that it isn't more than two 
weeks. If it is more than two weeks, then I will say that it is a bad 
experience for the new repository.

Me complaining (You don't have to read on):

I think my problem is more or less, I don't think I should need to tell 
people that I have a patch ready to be committed or reviewed ('commit' 
keyword should work for that). The process appears to be see ticket, 
write patch, submit complaint to wp-hackers or IRC to have them 
committed. God help you, if the core team or someone from Automattic 
disagrees with your patch or the ticket itself. So I always laugh, when 
like the commit team or it is mentioned that, patches are committed 
easily or tickets need patches (doesn't mean they'll be committed). No, 
historically, the process hasn't been as seamless as I think it should 
be. Although, to be fair, I usually work with low priority tickets, so 
that is a good reason for not caring. Not all of my patches were worth 
being committed and some of the tickets I wrote patches for weren't 
worth being part of WordPress.

That said, I haven't had one bad experience with having my patches 
committed, I've had two (and don't ask, I've all but blocked the 
experiences from my mind) and I don't count waiting a long time as an 
bad experience, waiting a long time is a "WTF?". I would say that except 
for a few code patches that were committed really fast (Yeah!), the only 
other patches I've submitted that had good experiences, were the inline 
documentation ones. I've often thought about transferring the tips I 
wrote on the funcdoc blog over to the codex to help those, who might 
give up after their first patch isn't committed in a timely fashion.

1) If I said this I'd get bitch-slapped within an inch of my life
2) My reply was a good deal more substantial.

But to deal with the existentials:
That there /is/ a commit demands/requires that there be a response.

IFF you want Subversion then c'mon, get off the pot. Or piss off.

Personality politics distort /everyRPTevery/ thing.

For sure, it has to be reviewed and might not be suitable etc.. But 
really that's not the point.  The point is that something should happen 
with the tickets.  Quite a lot of the WP trac tickets with patches just 
get bumped until they become redundant or outdated.  Of course this is 
not a discussion about WP trac, but all I was meaning was that It'd be a 
shame if that happened with the doc tickets as well.

Of course noone knows yet what would happen with this.  Let's hope it is 
all a smooth system.

I've waited a while to see how this conversation develops before joining in.

Lorelle (and other non technical folks) the fact that Subversion is to
be used is not really very important. It is merely revision control of
the changes. The most important thing we will get from Subversion, as
Mike and Matt pointed out, is the ability to branch the book's
'source' and to continue to develop those branches of the book
independently.

Austin you asked what problems using subversion will solve that the
wiki doesn't  - the main one is the ability to have one or more
'released' versions of the book at the same time as one or more
versions in development. A wiki is always the 'latest' version,
regardless of whether people are in the middle of updating things.
Sure you can look at past revisions of individual pages, but for
someone who wants to look at the 'current' documentation as opposed to
the half finished next version, they're stuck. You end up trying to
work around this problem with duplicated extra pages or marking up
sections of a page with a version indicator. Far from ideal.

For those assuming the process of submitting updated and new content
for a book will be in any way related to the process for submitting
code, there really is no correspondence. If you submit a patch to the
handbook that is 'wrong', at worst a paragraph or two might not make
sense, or will be grammaticality incorrect.  Whereas submitting code
that is worng means the program doesn't run or it corrupts the
database or leaves a security hole.
The two are not comparable. I also don't' expect the exact same set of
people will be involved.

Now to the important stuff: The real value of using the 'subversion
book' method is that it is using docbook to generate the output. That
is, the raw content of the book (the chapters, paragraphs, tables,
screen shots, etc.) is stored in DocBook's XML format. This has a
number of advatnages, many of which have been raised in this thread,
including supporting multiple formats, building the book on demand and
so on.

However, I need to raise some very serious problems with the
'subversion book' method.

Firstly, the subversion book is stored in just 16 files! That is each
chapter and appendix is a single file. The largest of which is 300K.
It will be impossible for multiple people to contribute to such large
pieces of work with actual patches. As soon as the first couple of
patches are applied the rest will be hopelessly out of date.

Which brings me to a  second problem. Subversion does not to my
knowledge diff xml files as xml files. That is, it does not understand
the semantics of an xml file structure. It treats them as ascii
records (lines) and that doesn't work for structured files. I am not
aware of a third party add-on that will do the job either (subversion
supports pluggable diff engines). At least not an open source one.

The upshot of which is that I do not believe subversion can be used to
directly manage 'patches' to the document in the way it is used for
code.

The files size issue could be addressed by splitting things up into
much smaller pieces (I presume DocBook supports that), but it still
doesn't solve the diff and patch issue.


So how to address that problem?

As was mentioned by Tom Johnson, I believe DITA is the correct
solution. Some background: At my last job the technical documentation
team and I came up with a solution to overwhelming documentation
demands and problems by creating a system based on DITA, Subversion,
some home grown php code, oh, and WordPress.

In a large nutshell, the DITA system breaks the content (the words in
the book) into manageable, and *reusable* chunks. Those chunks can be
as large as a whole chapter (not practical as given above) or as small
as a single phrase (which could be just one word -- probably going to
far). Most chunks are at the sub-topic level -- a couple of paragraphs
or so.

These chunks are then assembled in two ways, the first, by creating
topics which reference (and pull in) the smaller chunks to create a
topic about a particular subject.
Then those topics  are pulled to together in (a topicmap or bookmap --
like docBooks 'book' xml) to create chapters and whole books.

Now for the clever bits.

Firstly, single sourcing or re-use: wherever you have a common phrase,
or couple of sentences (a chunk), perhaps a common overview of a
subject that needs to be in several different topics (because in
reference books you do have to repeat yourself a lot), you write that
once, then reference it in all the topics it has to appear.
Got a typo - fix it once, and all the topics which reference it are
now fixed! Need to update it for the new version of WP - update it
once and all those topics are now updated.

Next: audiences and other meta data. Think of adding tags to the
content. Tags like 'WP2.6, WP2.7, Advanced-level, beginner-level,
offline, etc. You can add those at the level of an individual chunk, a
topic, or a whole chapter (in a topicmap).

So you might have a topic that begins with an intro (pulled in from a
common chunk) an overview, a simple beginners run through (tagged
beginner-level), followed by an advanced run through -- tagged with
advanced-level. Finally you tag all the screen shots with 'offiline'.

Now imagine being able to say "I want to build a beginner's manual for
version 2.6 in PDF"  - so you include chunks with tag WP2.6, exclude
chunks with tag advanced-level and include chunks with tag offline,
and build as PDF.

Or you want version 2.7 advanced manual in RTF? Include chunks with
WP2.6, beginner-level, advanced-level, and offline and build.

How about a beginners guide for on-line help use. Exclude
advanced-level and exclude offline, build as XHTML. Why exclude
offline? Screen shots don't add much to the 'help when you have the
screen in front of you.

Oh and I mentioned WordPress -- I built an importer which will take
the XHTML generated by DITA and import it into WordPress as a
hierarchical set of pages. I even have a version for WPMU that
supports populating each mu blog with separate areas of content.

Here is a link about DITA for the curious:
http://dita.xml.org/book/getting-started

Rather than have you Google search for this stuff and the lovely Miss
Von Tees show up at awkward moments, try my delicious links
http://delicious.com/mikelittle/dita

By the way, this doesn't solve the problem of diffs and patches, but
the much smaller chunks are manageable with a locking pattern rather
than copy and merge (I know its sacrilege to use Subversion in that
way!)

Hope this gives some food for thought. I have a whole load more on
process, standards, user contribution mechanisms and the need for
control.

I read Mike's comments with a lot of enthusiasm because he communicated the
whole DITA concept and benefits with a lot of clarity. I was especially
intrigued by his statement,

"Oh and I mentioned WordPress -- I built an importer which will take the
XHTML generated by DITA and import it into WordPress as a hierarchical set
of pages."

I would love to see WordPress harnessed as a DITA authoring tool. In some
way, the structured blogging plugin (http://structuredblogging.org/) is a
step in this direction. The posts created using the structured blogging
plugging are semantically structured in a way that enables them to be
syndicated and pulled into other systems, or something to that effect. It's
the concept of microformats -- like with hcalendar. The idea is to create
content structured in a way that all systems can parse and manipulate.

DITA is essentially the same idea. Create an XML structure for help material
that breaks free of any proprietary constraints or formats of specific
software, and the information you create is then free. It can move between
systems and be manipulated into different formats and deliverables.

DITA has been the hottest topic in technical communication for the last year
and a half. There is a tremendous industry push among almost all help
authoring tools to include support for DITA.

Would it be possible to enable WordPress to create DITA-structured topics?
All it would take is some kind of plugin similar to the structured blogging
plugin (perhaps the integration of the DITA Storm editor). If you can
empower WordPress as a DITA authoring tool, *you will then enable anyone to
create a topic structured in DITA. With these topics, you could create a
DITA map (table of contents) where you could pull in the topics you want
into the books you want (e.g., advanced, beginner, CSS-based).* *Essentially,
you enable every member of the community to become a help author, without
worrying about structure or other formatting expertise.*

As Mike pointed out, DITA is not only more scalable than DocBook, it's also
more flexible. The goal is not to produce a massive printable version of
WordPress documentation, but to provide specialized outputs for different
purposes, interests, and roles.

Although I'm not a DITA expert myself, I am very well connected to some DITA
experts (as well as DocBook experts) and would like get more involved in
this project, if this is a route you're interested in pursuing.

DocBook 5 allows you use the XInclude XML standard to include files, so 
in theory you can split chapters any way you want.

DITA, while more extensible and editable, is not without drawbacks. It costs
more time to integrate but on the long run seems to be very solid.

Message-ID: <87skn566wn.fsf@jidanni.org>

Gentlemen, you have blown it in that you
1. Use a ghastly outdated MediaWiki[1].
2. Have even gobbed up you ghastly outdated version of MediaWiki in
that e.g., any notification of redirection isn't shown. [2]
3. Even fixing 1 will not fix
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex_talk:Maintenance#Interwiki_links
which you need to update by hand in the MediaWiki maintenance
directory after updating.
P.S., links to http://wordpress.org/report-bugs/ should probably be
removed, as that form apparently leads to some black hole.

Indeed. I find many pages edited by amateurs, pure amateurs. OK, I
fixed one,

The main problem is links like

perhaps by some bot. Otherwise it is just a never ending monkey see monkey do.

It doesn't, but sorry you didn't get a reply. Due to the volume it 
receives not everything is responded to.

I can't believe you have linked http://codex.wordpress.org/favicon.ico
to a wiki page,
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:WhatLinksHere/Creating_a_Favicon

Would professionals do such a thing? http://en.wikipedia.org/favicon.ico

And low and behold right there in your headers is <link rel="shortcut
icon" href="/favicon.ico" />

I would recommenced you cease and desist from messing up your wiki.

In fact all these days I've been using emacs-w3m to read your wiki,
and downloading it to a PDA, so accessibility is really important to
me.

Well, today to see if I could see you favicon, I fired up Firefox, and
boy what a wait, google-analytic links, the works. Never waited around
for it to finish.

Anyway, I don't see any google-analytics links on the aforementioned
professionals website...

     On the main Codex Docs page, a little farther down there is this:

<link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://s.wordpress.org/favicon.ico"
type="image/x-icon" />

     I don't see that first link on every Codex page. Perhaps it was not
removed when the icon file was last updated.


> I would recommenced you cease and desist from messing up your wiki.

     I used to play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons. One game we had a
new player and I threw a new characteristic into the game. The new guy
cried foul because there was no such characteristic in the rules. He
said, "You are ruining your game." To which a long time player replied,
"Operative words there 'your game.' It's his game to mess up."

     You can make this wiki your wiki by getting involved. If you see 
something wrong, change it. If it is something you cannot change, *ask* 
who can and contact them. Be courteous. You will attract more flies with 
honey than with vinegar.

     There is always room for improvement. Perhaps you could submit some
solutions that solve the problems you are seeing.

Just a heads up to the Automattic crew.


1. If I visit http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ it wants to open that as a 
file...

2. Recent Changes seems to show  a bunch of weird characters for new users. 
Reported this yesterday via "Report a site bug".

Indeed. One must use http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=FAQ

Perhaps the administrators could use something like
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:DumpBackup.php to reinstall the
wiki on fresh disks to shake out all the weirdness that has crept in...

I don't know about the weird characters (they don't show up in Chrome) 
but the user registrations are a side effect of an upgrade to Mediawiki. 
(per request on the list.)

When you make a patch it includes which revision you're working off, and 
smart patch tools figure out how the lines have changed if there have 
been changes since then, right? I usually don't have trouble applying 
older patches to WP.

I'm not sure what's the matter with this, any different than using 
Subversion to manage a HTML file. Why does the diff engine need to be 
aware of the markup language?

I've fixed the links to the icon file within the wiki pages (which all
seem to need to point to the "creating a " page.

And I've escaped the example link tag on the "creating a " page, which
I suspect was being turned into a real one by MediaWiki.

But the url  http://codex.wordpress.org/favicon.ico  points to a
slightly broken 301 handler: the content returned says
The document has been permanently moved to <A HREF="%s">here</A>.<hr
/> where %s has not been replaced.
It seems to be a standard litespeed handler page.

The headers returned do include location header of
http://s.wordpress.org/favicon.ico which does return the ico file.

Hmm, looks okay in IE6 also.  Here's screenshot from Firefox 3.0.5 with the

You can filter those out of the recent changes by changing the namespace 
pulldown to "main".
