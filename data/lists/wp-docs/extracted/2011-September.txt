I think I agree with you Andrea. Though, I don't think anyone in this conversation is suggesting we provide site-specific support - that's obviously not manageable. But it would seem any questions people have to how WordPress functions - out of the box - should be included within the codex. So questions like "How do I edit a page?", or "How do I add a post?", etc... should be included in the codex in my opinion. Or at least some official WordPress wiki.

After reading a few more of these replies it sounds like there is becoming a consensus that the codex should be reserved for documentation related to installing WordPress.

I think it's good we're honing in on a focus for what the codex is. However, learn.WordPress.com isn't a sufficient resource (from what I've observed) regarding training on the fundamental aspects of WordPress as it's released to hosted sites because it's geared to training about WordPress.com - which is not the same thing technically.

What about a learn.WordPress.org? It could function exactly like the codex does but be focused on training. This would keep it separate from the codex, but still fulfill the critical need for basic training on how to actually use WordPress.

Thank you all very much for the feedback!  Far more than I expected, that's
for sure.
I have hit one snag when it comes to Multisite ... I haven't got the
slightest clue where or even if .htaccess file(s) are
even acknowledged/generated since from the best I can tell, the
save_mod_rewrite_rules() in wp-admin/includes/misc.php is responsible for
saving the .htaccess file and exits immediately if it is a multisite.
This really sucks considering I'm developing a theme for a multisite install
and did all of this on a single install without realizing this... Any
suggestions on where to look or if I'm just out of luck?

@Lorelle,
I honestly wasn't sure what title to use, but it was what I searched for
since Googling things pertaining to WordPress and .htaccess brings up a
bunch of stuff on manually editing the file or only pertained to internal
rewriting.
So in hopes of throwing someone a break, I figured I'd try to use a
unique(r) title and hope they find it.  If nothing else, I did put a link to
it on the http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Rewrite page at the
bottom since that's THE PLACE to find more on the topic.
I didn't want to clutter that page any more and didn't feel a new Codex page
was needed, so I used a User page instead.  Normally I would've just used a
blog post, but it's much better structured there and just made a cozy spot
that others can expand on it as well and not have to do so in long threaded
comments.

Thanks again.

Multisite is special. Flushing doesn't change your .htaccess rules in
that case, because those rules apply to the entire network, not just
to one site in that network.

There is no way to write special .htaccess rules from WP in a
multisite install that I am aware of.

And those basics are there  http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts (for
example). I'm not suggesting they not be. (double negative, sorry.)

I think there was a misunderstanding with regards to my pointing our the
WordPress.com docs as an *example*. I had responded to m3shrom here:
http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2011-August/002651.html

where he said:

">* Personally, I've struggled in working on docs which are targeted at*

>* people using*>* - their own install*>* - Wordpress.com*>* - a blog on a hosted WordPress network"*

And I was reiterating that the codex should be solely for people managing
their own install. That's it. If they are managing their own network, that
is also covered, but we should not be expected to write docs for people who
have someone else managing their blog.

Does that make sense?

and presentation has been improved, some areas have been brought up to

have taken cues from the discussion page.

Hi,

is there a codex git repo for offline processing / viewing? I need the
codex  offline for a long time and would like to update it a few times
a week with git pull - is this possible?

If NOT - would you be interested in this? I can offer to maintain it a
little  bit,  if  you like - I think giving access to docs offline via
git will be a great benefit!

Please tell me, what you think, THANKS!

Have a nice day,

Hi Lorelle, 

thank you very much for your attention - however, it would be really
great to receive answers to my questions.

I searched the archives using google but found only 3 entries for git
without any relevance for my questions.

So I assume the answer to my first question

> is there a codex git repo for offline processing / viewing?

would be NO - is this right? 

Note: you can answer with a positive sounding YES on this ;)

My second question was: 

> would you be interested in this?

If you are not interested in a codex git repo I surely will
immediately stop investigating into this and spend my time with
something that actually finds some positive resonance - I was
intending to improve the wordpress codex experience.

Of course I found the "Dump of the Codex?" thread - this interesting
discussion ends with your important observation:

> The problem is that the Codex is a living document and changes
> daily, so these tend to go out of date fast.

Unfortunately the discussion stops there - much too early, many
options have not been mentioned - you definitely are right with your
observation, but there are several other ways of mirroring or dumping
the codex database to a git repo.

The most efficient solutions will only work with direct access to the
codex mediawiki database, so your interest in offering a solution will
be the first requirement - if you do not want it, we do not need to
discuss better ways to mirror the codex.

If you like the idea and would like to support it, why not discuss it?


BTW there is a problem with access to the mailing list interface and
also to the archives - if I copy the link

http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs

and paste it into the browser address bar I get a 403 "forbidden".

however, accessing it from
http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo DOES work - strange - I
did not look deeper into this as it seems to be some kind of webserver
misconfig...

Thanks for your attention,
Bughunter

Offline viewing of the codex: http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2011-May/002548.html

Not a GIT question per say but a MediaWiki one.

yes, did you read my message? I wrote about that thread and that it
starts too early. There are many mediawiki export tools.

I believe the MediaWiki project is working on offline support in a coming release.

And as that thread pointed out, we were using a MediaWiki version that is too many revisions back to make full use of them.  Still are, actually.  Current revision is 1.17.0, we're on 1.15.0, and MediaWiki's plugin-- sorry, EXTENSION matrix is a clustered mess that makes me giggle whenever someone looks at WordPress's and complains. (Perspective is a wondrous thing.)

You can still export pages: http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Export

We just can't add the tools in that would make it allow for decent offline viewing.

So ... is there a specific tool you have in mind that we CAN use?  If you know of one, do share.

Did you ever try https://github.com/tierra/mwpublisher ? - the code is
quite old, but the author says it still works, I asked him via gitub.

Also there is the old dump script:
http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/maintenance/dumpBackup.php?view=markup

the tools are already there, if you have mediawiki and php on the

http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps

if you provide some dumps the other part of the work could be done by
people interested in transforming the dumps into any decent format for
offline viewing. Would be great to have the codex dumps downloadable
or even better rsyncable, that?s not too much of an effort, is it?

One small step for you, one giant leap for the community... ;)

Thanks again for your attention!

As was mentioned in the other thread, the mediawiki is not a vanilla one.

By the way, you could have scraped the whole site by now with a simple wget.

You have yet to explain why you need this. What giant leap for the community
will you having a private copy of the codex provide?

Actually what you wrote was "is there a codex git repo for offline

I don't feel like you have to explain it, I simply asked the question.

You seem to be very insistent asking for something there seems little
enthusiasm to do, and then you declared that it would be good for the
community, but I didn't understand from your earlier posts in this thread
why it would be good.

As I mention above, you specifically referred to "processing"

It has been explained in this thread and the other referred thread that the
codex is not a standard codex and has modified code, and for all I know
modified data structure too.

And as I have already pointed out in my previous email, you could have
spidered the whole codex many times over during the course of this thread.

Why would a spidered copy of the site not be suitable for off line reading?

Firstly, it's not my MediaWiki, secondly, you seem to be making the mistake
that what you think is desirable and easy, is desirable and easy for anyone
else. It seems to me that there is no great desire to provide this service.

Understanding the why and wherefore of a question helps the people answering it find the best answer possible.  Many times, the best answer that satisfies as much as possible, can only be found with a complete understanding.

In that specific situation, people who need to access it while working offline, I would consider spinning up my own, localhost version of MediaWiki (make it read only), running an export of the WordPress content, and copying it all up.  Sync it once or twice a week, and Bob's your uncle.  Keeps it both readable AND in a familiar format/layout.

Subject: [wp-docs] Proposed change to Giving WordPress Its Own Directory
Message-ID: <a471dcbfe65dd7fe098bd282a1ff60a8@ipstenu.org>

I've noticed a lot of people have WP in a subfolder and want to use 
that to run 'as if it was in root.'  To most of us, just following the 
directions on 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Giving_WordPress_Its_Own_Directory and 
skipping the obvious parts is ... obvious.

But not so to a newbie.

I drafted out 
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Ipstenu/Giving_WordPress_Its_Own_Directory 
which has a subsection for when your site is already in a subfolder.

Since "Giving WordPress Its Own Directory" is locked, I'm pitching that 
re-write here :)

I'm also kind of thinking we should remove the SVN stuff - Doesn't seem 
very appropriate.

I agree that this would be far more helpful to a newbie.

Agreed. Perhaps the WordPress MU sub-section at the bottom of the page 
could also be removed?

Removed both. It's not like we can't easily add 'em back in!

Totally brilliant!!! Thanks for finding the gap and filling it.

However, we need to change the references from example.com/wordpress/ and
example.com/wp/ to other subweb/folder names. There is a chronic problem
with using these folder names which appear in the URL. They turn up in
searches with unrelated content just because "wordpress" is in the url. We
need to get people to install WordPress in other folder names like /blog/ or
/posts/ or /cars/ for all I care and get WordPress out of the URL. Someone
blogging about cars and never WordPress shouldn't have WordPress in the URL.


Not sure how to handle that so I'm leaving it up to you. It's an SEO issue
but it's also a control issue. They should be able to name it whatever they
want that is relevant to their content and topic.

Make sense?

Couldn't agree more. Perhaps this should be dealt with at the 
installation stage?

<http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress> does mention it but 
perhaps it could emphasised more? In fact maybe the whole 5 minute guide 
could do with an overhaul? There are lots of references to "directories" 
and subdirectories" whilst people seem more used to "folders" these days.

Sample rewrite of Step 5:

5. Get ready to upload the WordPress files to your web server:

# If you want WordPress to run your main site (e.g. 
http://example.com/), upload all of the contents of the 'wordpress' 
folder (but *not* the folder itself)  to your web server.

# If you want to have WordPress to have its own folder on your web site 
(e.g. http://example.com/blog/), rename the wordpress folder on your 
computer to your preferred name (e.g. blog) and then upload the entire 
folder to your web server.

Thoughts?

On your side. Good point. Maybe we need to do a full run at this and make
sure that we aren't shooting ourselves in the foot and making things worse.

I'm all for adding bits to the install procedure to persuade people to
not use /wordpress/. Yes.

The only problem is 'blog' is only slightly more useful than 'wordpress' - The number of sites that use WP for something other than a blog is on the rise.  Perhaps it would be better to make it clear that the folder name is mutable.

(Also I'd keep in subdirectories, as if you switch to MultiSite, the install is either subdirectory or subdomain, not 'subfolder' and it would carry through logically as the users grow in skill level.  Of course to say 'subdirectory (i.e. a folder)' is not inappropriate!)

5. Get ready to upload the WordPress files to your web server:

# If you want WordPress to run your main site (e.g. http://example.com/ ), upload all of the contents of the 'wordpress' folder (but <strong>not</strong> the folder itself)  to your web server.

# If you want to have WordPress to have its own folder on your web site (e.g. http://example.com/FOLDERNAME/ ), rename the wordpress folder on your computer to your preferred name (e.g. FOLDERNAME) and then upload the entire folder to your web server.  This name will be a part of your URL, so be certain to pick something appropriate to your site, be it 'blog' or 'news.'  Using 'wordpress' as your folder name is not advised, as it's rarely relevant to the visitors to you site.

I agree that 'blog' isn't that helpful but, if we want a generic example 
in there (and that would probably be a Good Idea), we're always going to 
be stuck with something that doesn't suit 90% of sites.

Good point. So perhaps use 'subdirectory (a folder within the main 
directory)' when referring to the server?

FWIW, I think this is (bizarrely) the most important change:

> 5. Get ready to upload the WordPress files to your web server:

The current page says "Upload the WordPress files...' and I think people 
stop reading Step 5 at that point. So the whole 'choosing the right 
folder name or install in root' gets missed, when what we really want is 
for people to stop and think for a moment before they upload.

Another shot at the 5-minute install:
<http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Esmi/5-Minute_Install#Famous_5-Minute_Install>

Bit I can still see areas on 
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Detailed_Instructions> 
that need either expanding or possible removing. For example:

- Things You Need to Do to Install WordPress
Possibly expand to link to Create the Database and a User

- Detailed Instructions
How useful are all the details on using wget these days?

I think you're right about number 5.

Trying to make it obvious but not klugdey (since if you use WP in own 
directory, no one sees you named the folder gooberville unless they 
login or view source)

5. Get ready to upload the WordPress files to your web server.  The 
name of the subdirectory (aka a folder within the main directory) on 
your server that you install WordPress into will be a part of your URL.  
Be certain to pick something appropriate, be it 'blog' or 'news.'  Using 
'wordpress' as your folder name is not advised.

# If you want WordPress to run your main site (e.g. http://example.com/ 
), upload all of the contents of the 'wordpress' folder (but 
<strong>not</strong> the folder itself)  to your web server.

# If you want to have WordPress to have its own folder on your web site 
(e.g. http://example.com/blog/ ), rename the wordpress folder on your 
computer to your preferred name (e.g. blog) and then upload the entire 
folder to your web server.

Might it be helpful if the default download .ZIP file didn't put all its
contents inside a "wordpress" folder?

I did wonder about this too but assumed there was some logistical reason

# If you want to have WordPress to have its own folder on your web
site (e.g. http://example.com/blog/ ), create a folder with the
preferred name (e.g. blog) on the server. Then, upload all of the
contents of the 'wordpress' folder (but <strong>not</strong> the
folder itself)  into the newly created folder on your web server (e.g.
blog).


I know this is late in the discussion. But, I wanted to present the
above modification as a possibility.
I like the other paragraphs.
The main impetus for even suggestion and alteration is to create a
situation in which the upload process is basically the same. The only
difference being the target directory on the server.

Just a thought.

Probably because not having a folder could easily overwrite files and 
stuff by the ignorant.  It's SOP for most webapps.

I think more new users are more comfortable renaming folders on their 
computers than via FTP.  (This is based on nothing but a gut feeling.)
