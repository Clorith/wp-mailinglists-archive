Hi WP-docs team,

For some reason I just landed on this Codex page, last edited in 2008,
and I see that the parts at the page bottom definitely need some
editing by someone knowledgeable:
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies

:)

Best,
Manuel

I don't see a reply but it looks some like of the docs team did some
clean up of the article. Thank you for bringing it to our attention.

WordPress is now part of the WordPress Foundation, a non-profit that
is entitled to accept donations, so some minor wording was changed to
clear up some of the specifics.

Thanks!

Lorelle
