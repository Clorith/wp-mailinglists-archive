I just went through and corrected a few things as I've heard from some more
people eager to get this information. Go through it and make sure I didn't
mess it up and add the rest of the fixes and let's get this thing moved
into the core docs. It's a great piece of work, Barrett! Well done!
Applause!

@Jane: Are there any other pages that will be directly linked from
WordPress 3.3 that need work? Can you add them to the docs task list blog
so we can make sure that all of them are covered? Thanks!

@Jan It looks great but I had no idea that it was such an octopus in
general, not just outgoing links. I just went through and pruned and
updated it with a vengeance, streamlining the entire thing and getting rid
of the redundancies. Most of your changes are probably still there, but I
fear my exuberance might have bulldozed them.

This is a hard one as I usually just offer tips and recommendations on
editing, but this one is an important document and needs to get the
information to the user NOW. More lists, less words, to the point. So I
took a hatchet to the whole thing.

We need updated images on this. Whoever wants to take that on (hint, hint,
Jan. :D ) have at it.

Jan and everyone, go through it with a fine tooth comb as I'm sure I missed
something or messed up some detail. I really hacked it good.

Some important points to note for future editing (and don't let this stop
you. All of those octopus links need checking and updating!!!):

* Plugin is a proper name, so it's capitalized (yeah search and replace!).

* Not always but when appropriate we use WordPress Plugin not Plugin to
boost the findability with SEO.

* We resist attempts to use HTML when formatting just about everything,
especially lists. I know it's a pain to learn wikispeak, but it's actually
fewer keystrokes than HTML.

* Watch the storytelling on such documents. This isn't for you but for us
all. There wasn't much, and I probably put it there years ago when we had a
story to tell, but I got rid of the stories to tighten it up to get to the
point: HOW DO I DO THIS NOW?

It's time for everyone to take a gander at this and make sure we've dotted
all the t's and crossed the i's.

Thanks!

Lorelle

Hi,

I have updated http://codex.wordpress.org/Category:UI_Link with all the references to the Codex in the wp-admin folder of Trunk as of revision 19537. While doing that I noticed quite a few were listed as Stubs or needs editing.

Lorelle,
added some example code for wp_login_form(), as you requested,
also another image showing where hooks can print text.

in the Customize section, i think i need to add a sentence about CSS  
"specificity."
what i have is kinda confusing; but with a little CSS-learnin'- 
language, it'll clear up.

should be done w/ that this morn.
then i'll run all the code (PHP & CSS) again to re-confirm it all  
works as described.
then you can get out your devastatingly accurate red pen one more time,
then it's ready for unleashing on the WordPress public:

I believe the site was rejected as www.wpclever.com and collaboration ... my
question is what kind of collaboration I can do to add it to your language

I hope to answer, as there is a moderator that I removed from the site. Without

We do not allow sites to be added unless they feature a post that is
specific to the topic under discussion. I didn't moderate your addition to
the Codex, but that is generally the reason. It is spelled out clearly in
the Codex Contribution Guidelines.

Hi,

As a reverter of some of the changes made in the Codex, I thought I should chime in.

In the Codex we encourage users of WordPress to only install a copy from a download from WordPress.org. For example the changes removed de.wordpess.org as the place to download the German version in favor of wpclover.com/de.

I feel that it makes more sense to refer them to an official download as the active WP community in their language has likely linked to the version of codex and forums in their language. In addition  wpclover does not contribute a service that is not already available from wordpress.org and wpclover look tacky and had many grammatical issues something that the Codex should not be linking to.

But they have several changes for the better, each language.

Another thing, what else might work for my site not to draw the codex?

If someone has translation improvements, we would like them to 
contribute to the official translations rather than setting up alternate 
projects. While setting alternate projects is perfectly fine thanks to 
the GPL, the wordpress.org site will only promote official versions.

 There are many downloads page leading to other unofficial servers. What
about this?

They are linked in the codex.

There are many old pieces of content in the Codex from before we had 
centralized things in place. It's up to the Codex editors to make the 
calls on these things.

I suppose a support forum according to the language would be a worthy
contribution?
Or a site with a list of plugins by language?

Gloria, we have an active international community that is centralized at 
wordpress.org, coordinated by Jos? Fontainhas. It includes forums as 
well as translations, and is open to all for contributions. I've asked 
him to reply to your last email to point you in the right direction.

Gloria, your enthusiasm is appreciated. As Jane stated, we have an active
international community and if you would like to participate, Jose is a
great person to start with. If you wish to create an independent site to
offer WordPress services and help on your own, that is up to you but the
WordPress Codex cannot offer a link to the site as explained previously.

The WordPress in Your Language page on the WordPress Codex is not so much
supported by the documentation team as it is by the international community
supporting WordPress translations and documentation. Jose will have
information on the right contact person for your region.

For the rest of us, it's clearly time to take another look at that page and
update it. Anyone up for it, just to clear out the dead links? We'll need
to get the poly-glots to get on adding or updating links. I can post
something on their mailing list, or did they get their own site yet? Anyone
active on that group?

Thanks!

Lorelle

Post-core-meetup this month will be setting up more sites in the Make 
section on wp.org now that jetpack has email subscriptions, including 
for docs.

You can help with translations and localization through the previously
mentioned wppolyglots.wordpress.com. If you would like to help us on
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language for the section on
your language, that would be helpful, but we probably will not include the
link to that site for the reasons already discussed.

I also recommend you contact the people handling the translation and
localization in your language within the WP-Polyglots group. I'm sure they
would love the help and you would enjoy getting to know and learn from
them, too.

Thanks,

Lorelle

Gloria,

You original question was about a rejected edit of the Codex. The
reasons for that edit were explained by Charles in more detail.

As explained by Jane and Lorelle, the community of people who want to
contribute to localized versions of WordPress talks here:
http://wppolyglots.wordpress.com. Please drop by to discuss any issues
concerning the translations of WordPress. All help is very welcome
(and by the way, and if I'm not mistaken, this might be of interest to
you: http://cl.wordpress.org/ ).

In that spirit, and since what we're discussing now has little to do
with the Codex, I'd suggest posting your issue in
http://wppolyglots.wordpress.com. If you'd rather discuss this in your
native language (which I'm assuming is spanish), feel free to contact
me directly, I'm glad to help.

@Lorelle:

> For the rest of us, it's clearly time to take another look at that page and update it.

I'm available to help-out, and will also post a call for help on the
polygots' P2

 I want to make a support forum style itself: http://wordpress.cl/foro/ with
people in my office, should have equal right to link to that forum.

Please. This is *not* a documentation issue, and should be posted on
http://wppolyglots.wordpress.com or else discussed directly with me.
Please do not use this mailing list for that.

Also a quick note regarding wordpress.cl: although it's great to see
people building successful communities around WordPress, unfortunately
that domain name is infringing on the WordPress trademark as described
here: http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/

Please adjust the domain name accordingly. If you have any questions,
once again, feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you.

Gloria:
1. We have already made it clear several times why a non-official 
support forum will not be linked to from official resources. If you want 
to contribute to something that the Codex promotes, please contribute to 
the official resources, which Jose has pointed you to.

2. Please keep a respectful tone when addressing this list.

I think WordPress has a BIG problem with internationalization...

Hehehe the one million question...

Spamming is at first to send messages to a mailing list which are not
related to the topic of this mailing list, annoying a large number of
silencious people like me. 

Spamming is also not being able to properly quote and discuss in the logical
order, according to basic netiquette, which is required on the mailing list,
netiquette we all agreed to follow when we become member of this list. 

 

Please,

-          Truncate your messages

-          Quote what you are answering to

-          Answer under

-          Sign properly

Uhmm sorry?.... i forget something?...

It's only my personal opinion. :-S

Nettiquete? i think i dont make anything to be unpolite or whatever you 
think about this.

I think all contributions for Codex will be cleaned for any link with 
commercial ads. Included all forks...

I see many forks of Codex on many languages, and make money with ads. 
This is the real problem.

Why people create a fork with codex and dont work for the community?

Do i break netiquette of mailing list making this question? :-S

I work in many open source projects and i know the hard way to solve 
this... unfortunalety.

Be happy Lumiere de Lune...

As said before in this discussion, Z? Fontainhas is your contact.

Quoting him:

As explained by Jane and Lorelle, the community of people who want to
contribute to localized versions of WordPress talks here:
http://wppolyglots.wordpress.com. Please drop by to discuss any issues
concerning the translations of WordPress.

As said before again, this list is not the place for polyglots / localized
versions discussions.

Lorelle asked if there were more pages that needed to be updated for 
3.3. http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19345 has a list of things 
that changed dev-wise enough to require documentation. Most of it has 
been written up on wpdevel. If someone wanted to check over the info 
there and amend codex as necessary, that would be great.

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex automated page creation for functions?
Message-ID: <B0D5388A-CA02-4572-BA60-9A2F7AB02793@gmail.com>

Hey all,

There are many websites out there that automatically parse the phpdoc of trunk, creating a very complete, although very big, documentation of WP core. 

Examples:

http://phpxref.com/xref/wordpress/_functions/index.html
wpseek.com

On WP.org there is this: http://phpdoc.wordpress.org/trunk/ which catalogs code in a similar manner.

I'm wondering why functions and their phpdoc are not hooked into the Codex at all, at least have pages made automatically for functions. It wouldn't clog the codex by creating tons of pages, because these functions won't be in a huge list anywhere, however where deemed appropriate functions can be linked to from the Functions Reference or anywhere else.

Perhaps a similar process could be employed for actions and hooks.

The reason I bring this up is because I just used media_sideload_image in a project I'm working on and realized there wasn't a Codex page for this function, which I made immediately. It would've been nice to at least have the PHPdoc there waiting for me, which I used to make the basis of the page.

I would second this. Although it would mean a major rework of the Codex
(in fact how it fundamentally functions) I think this would plug the
various gaps in documentation in the Codex in an organised manner. I've
found that reading the WordPress source seems to yield more information
than the Codex itself in some instances which is not ideal. Implementing
this would solve the problem. It would require some discussion with the
development group I would imagine so that they include at least a basic
descriptor of the class/function etc.

I wrote this page (as an attempt at thanks to all the work that goes into Wordpress) some time ago but got stuck as to what to do with it. It is still relevant up to Snow Leopard - I've not tested on Tiger.

I notice there is now a very straightforward  page in the codex on how to install Mamp so perhaps my contribution is now redundant - which is fine.

Barrett Golding has done another great job. Quick review look for this,
please, and let's move this into the root. I'm offline for the next 4-6
days for a very rare break from the world. See you next week and thanks all!

Subject: [wp-docs] WordPress Guide in Codex
Message-ID: <CAN2v4ZSAP+KeSO5r9V8zo_nU0LoeNBfYDqjTpBTQjxAd21ofEQ@mail.gmail.com>

One of my goals this year with the Codex is to address the issue of too
many businesses, schools, associations, and groups writing their own
"WordPress Guides" for using WordPress. We now have excellent connections
with support within WordPress core, Learn WordPress, and WordPress Lessons
to help with a lot of the basics for using WordPress and I'd like to take
this a step further in the Codex. I want people to NOT have to write
inhouse guides except for guidelines specific to their special needs. NASA
even has one. SIGH.

1. Create a review list of the public guides online (good and bad) with
comments.

2. Create a layout of the steps needed and linked to Codex and Learn
articles/videos already available.

3. Proposals on how to fill in the gaps and create a TOC guide or
step-by-step process to help those needing such guides within the Codex and
help the Learn team find gaps.

4. Create a "form" on the Codex for groups to build upon for creating their
own inhouse guide.

This should help us really identify the gaps we have in documentation. It
will also help all the documentation projects around WordPress without
stepping on toes, I hope.

Want to join the process?

Thanks!

I'm in!

Not only that, at StudioPress we really like to send people to official
resources first. there's just no good singular spot to send a new user who
just heard of WP. Sometimes I send people to wp.com resources, but that
confuses them as well. We do get a fair amount of general WordPress related
questions.

And I can spend some work time on this. ;) I've already got a short list of
basic tutorials needed, including ones that could be easier to find.

One basic tutorial missing, and yes needed by a totally new user, is how to
create a home link using the custom nav menu. Yes, you just use the custom
link option and fill in your URL. But this is non-obvious to
someone learning. :)

I'll see if I can get my list typed up soonish. Hey, aren't you going away
for a few days? :P

Glad you are excited about this and see the need. Whether we do something
really solid with this or just use this as an exercise to find gaps in the
documentation, I know it will help everyone. I really want to help beef up
all documentation across WordPress this year. It's THE year. :D And yes,
I'm supposed to be out of Internet touch for the next few days but I wanted
to get some thoughts bubbling on this.

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/WordPress_Guide_Project

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/WordPress_Guide_Project_TOC

These are the starts to this project. I've just put in some babble to get
it off the ground. I took another look at wiki tables and fled immediately
to Google Docs for the research list. :D

Some of this is old stuff, but I really want to see what we can offer to
help people use WordPress with less stress and give them the guides they
need.

I'm starting to see three distinct guides with overlaps for WP, WPC, and
MS, so we need some creative brainstorming on how we want to handle that
"flow chart" and not be redundant.

Thanks!

Lorelle

I could go either way on the title. Do we have anything on this elsewhere
so we don't create a duplicate title battle? I couldn't find it, but I'm
packing and recovering from the plague. :D

Subject: [wp-docs] Navigation box moved on FireFox update
Message-ID: <076f01ccc016$09565c90$1c0315b0$@gmail.com>

If off-topic please ignore.

 

In Codex I use the Monobook skin preference.  

 

I just upgraded to FireFox 9.0 on a Win7 machine and now when I visit Codex
the navigation box  on the left side (containing links to Main page, Recent
Changes, etc) falls below the main window box.  So for instance, at the Main
page, the navigation box is below the main container-meaning it's left and
below of the Category:About WordPress link.

 

In Firefix 8, the navigation window fell right below the MediaWiki sunflower
logo.

 

On other MediaWiki sites such as https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC the navigation
box is place correctly, but in Codex it is way to the bottom left.

 

Is this a Codex problem or a Firefox problem?

 

Thanks for any input

 

MichaelH

I'm back. Sorta. Sinus infection.

I didn't see a response to this. What does it look like without the skin
preference? Few people use the skins, so it's important to meet those needs
first.

Thanks!
