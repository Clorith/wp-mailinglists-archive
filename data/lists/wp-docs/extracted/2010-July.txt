A contributor of the local support forums contacted me today saying
that he wanted to translate an article in the Codex and couldn't
register.

I have browsed the recent posts in this mailing list and suggested him
to use his wp.org username, however it didn't work:
"There is no user by the name "alexpts". Check your spelling."

Is it possible for him to login somehow?

As stated at the bottom of the front page of the Codex, not a very visible
place, I admit, it explains that we've had a huge rash of spam attacks
lately and we're working on resolving the issue with logins. Stay tuned for
news on this.

If you have access, possibly you could share it with him and help him
through the process until we get the login issue resolved. Thanks!

Currently new user registration is disabled on the codex.

I'm working on integrating the codex logins with the rest of the .org
system right now, so that your normal .org login will work and we
won't have the need for a separate registration. This may take some
time.

Note: Usernames are going to be a bit of a problem. If you have any
non-alphanumeric characters in your wordpress.org username, you may
want to rethink what your username should be. The wiki has some rather
strict username requirements, more strict than WordPress itself. I'm
trying to work around these, but it may not be possible to work around
them all.

Lorelle & Otto,

Thanks for your work and clarifications.

We'll wait until wp.org logins are supported.

What is the difference between wp.org logins and codex logins? I have yet to
figure out the reason for this.

To expand a little more beyond what Chip said, each "section" of WordPress
uses different publishing platforms. Few have access to the "WordPress" part
of WordPress.org or WordPress.com (they both have similar setups) as the
bloggy part is small comparatively.

The Forums are on bbPress. The Codex is on MediaWiki. There are even efforts
to incorporate some BuddyPress features into the whole mess, though I'm not
sure of the status of those yet, and how much is BuddyPress and how much is
custom.

Each of these has their own logins. Integrating the forums into
WordPress.org was easy as it was mostly bbPress. After a couple years, they
incorporated the "look and feel" of the Codex into the main site, but logins
were never completely merged in. Now, that's the effort. How to combine two
extensive and HUGE databases into one. Kudos to all involved in the effort.
It's a monstrous one and I hope they blog it cuz I'm fascinated to see how
it all comes together and the challenges that had to be overcome in the
process.

Hopefully soon, we'll all be one happy login family. :D

Lorelle

I have the new codex logins working, actually. It is a rather simple
MediaWiki plugin. The upgrade to the support forums did set me back a
bit as I had to rework the code to handle the new password hashing
mechanisms.

I'll install it as soon as I get the unified cookie system working, so
that logging into one place will log you into all of them. :)

It is rather simple, I agree.

Jane, Otto, etc. I was asking why we force people to register on
wp.orginstead of on the codex. Is
wp.org more restrictive?

When it goes into place what happens to those of us with different 
passwords, does the forum password then take precedence?

The opposite, actually. MW has more restrictions on usernames and
such. This is currently a sticking point I'm working around.

The reasoning, however, is simply to have a unified login system
across all of *.wordpress.org. It already is there for trac, extend,
support, ideas, etc. The codex is just the last place to be
integrated. Having people have to have different usernames and
passwords across different parts of the site is silly.

Short answer: yes.

Long answer: Details aren't fully finalized yet, it's a work in
progress. I'm still testing it on a local MW installation and working
out the kinks.

However, when it goes into place, all existing codex logins will cease
to be. Only wporg logins (and their passwords) will work. However, if
your username is the same between the two, then you'll (probably)
still have all your history and such. If your username is different...
err.. tough luck, I guess. Maybe we can adjust usernames for specific
cases or something. I don't think this will happen enough to worry
about.

But my goal is that you shouldn't have to login to the codex at all.
The login cookie from one place will work across all subdomains. Log
in at one place, and you're logged into all of them.

I'm fine making username restrictions more strict for all of .org.

We can definitely import history for super-active contributors, like 
many of the people on this list. :)

I'm sure I don't need to say this, but just in case people on the list are
catching up with this thread at this particular moment, you are going to be
announcing this publicly when it's complete? I worry about those active on
the Codex who have filtered out or ignored the docs mailing list, as well as
others interested in becoming involved again.

It'd be nice to combine this with a push to get involved in the Codex,
especially since so many have felt it's irrelevant with the talk of the
handbook. It's a still viable collection of documentation and I'd really
love to see it become more focused on tutorials, especially in the WordPress
Lessons category and section.

I spend a significant amount of time on the forums try to persuade users 
to chose a custom permalink structure that starts with a numeric based 
on the discussion in:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2009-January/011097.html

On revisiting http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks today, I 
happened to take proper notice of the screenshot under "Choosing your 
permalink structure"

/%catgeory%/%postname%/ ??

Shouldn't the screenshot underline the page's recommendations?

That's a good idea. It should probably also reflect a version of WordPress

Purely out of interest (cause this is news to me)

How does a permalink structure including numbers solve the problem  
outlined in that old thread, and why isn't this solution more widely  
published? If it works then it sounds like something that pretty much  
everyone should do!

Starting a URL with an arbitrary number is an optimization for an existing implementation; i.e for the benefit for the programmer. OTOH, it's a negative for the user because it makes URLs longer than they need to be, makes them appear to the user to be more obscure (because with arbitrary number they are) and it makes it harder for the user to guess the more obvious URLs.

It is mentioned quite specifically in about 5 different places on the

The Codex is now authenticating against the normal wordpress.org
usernames and passwords. Old codex username and password combinations
will now no longer work.

Note: I fully expect this to have a few issues. Please email me
directly about any problems you find. Put ?CODEX? in your subject
line.

Note 2: If you previously had your codex username as something
different than your normal forum username and you want to preserve
your editing history and such, email me as well. I can rename your old
username and correct the issue. I?ll need to know what your username
on the codex used to be and what your new username from the
wordpress.org forums is.

Note 3: Yes, cookies aren?t working fully. This will be resolved when
the forum upgrades are complete across the Extend sections as well.

Awesome job, Otto. What a nightmare. I'm hoping good things come out of this
and we all learn more about how to integrate these goodies to benefit others
who use the WordPress/MediaWiki/bbPress combination. You're a star!

Just to double check, if we can log in and out and back again without any
problems, this means that we don't have to do anything more? But those who
can't login have to do note 1 and note 2?

I looked but didn't see an announcement yet. Is there going to be one?
Thanks so much!

For a very detailed report on why words are not efficient (has nothing to do
with SEO, pretty, nor usefulness), see
http://ottopress.com/2010/category-in-permalinks-considered-harmful/

And yes, the page needs to be updated to reflect this information.
Originally, it was believed to be possible, since
example.com/my-blog-title/works as words, but it's more complicated
than that. Trust me, I've been
fighting this issue since 2003. If there were a way, I'd be doing it right
now. I think a screenshot is not needed on such a page as the instructions
are fairly clear.

FYI, I've got a ticket[1] in to redo the URL routing system that I plan to work on once I can clear current client obligations (or ideally if a by-the-hour client obligation requires it. :)  It's unknown at this time if the core team will adopt it but minimally I should be able to make it a plugin.

The majority of the code came from two different plugins that did this
sort of thing before. They had to be modified for wporg specifically,
and to support the newer versions of WordPress/bbPress password/cookie
handling.

The two plugins in question are:

# AuthWordpress.php
# Copyright (C) 2007 Heriniaina Eugene <hery at serasera.org>

// AuthWP.php
// Version 0.2
// Copyright (C) 2008-9 Ciaran Gultnieks <ciaran at ciarang.com>

Mad props to them for releasing their code freely to do this sort of thing.

Potential issues: If you get an error, it should be pretty blatant. I
didn't try to prettify the error cases. That said, the errors I'm
expecting are more along the lines of people with weird usernames. I
munged accordingly, but I might have missed a case here or there. If
your username is alphanumeric, I don't expect any problems. MediaWiki
is very picky about usernames, so it might turn some characters into
underscores and things like that. This will only affect the username
display in MW, *not* the login username. You login with exactly
whatever your username in the forums is.

Contribution histories: People who had a different username across the
two will basically lose their contribution history. However, I
installed an extension to let me move their history to the new
username. I just tested it and it worked perfectly. So I can move the
contribution histories around as needed on a case by case basis.

That's awesome. I just took a glance but it appears to deal specifically
with same name subdirectories. Would that same thing apply to the issue at
hand? By making the process of using names not numbers not slowing down the
database and addressing the issues outlined by Otto? If so, I'll be the
first one on board!

The ticket started out with that but it evolved into something much bigger as I explored what was needed.  If you have time, scan the entire thing.

> Would that same thing apply to the issue at hand? By making the process of using names not numbers not slowing down the database and addressing the issues outlined by Otto? If so, I'll be the first one on board! 

Yes, exactly.  In summary it would be to create a system that replaced as little in WordPress as absolutely necessary but that inspected and routed URLs by path segment instead of by attempting to match against the full URL.

So if you wanted /%category%/$post_name%/ and there was a category of /fiction/davinci-code/ then it would first look at "fiction" to see if it is a category and there is then it would look for a post of "divinci-code" but if no match for category="fiction" then it would keep looking in the root of the URL space.  This model could much more easily be optimized and it would be easier to validate, i.e. we could validate URL slugs. So a page slug of "fiction" could be disallowed if there was a category called "fiction", assuming categories had priority over pages.  OTOH if pages had priority then we could disallow a category of "fiction" if there was a page called "fiction." 
(All of this should be configurable in code by the site developer.)

That's the vision, anyway.

Hi docs team,
Several members of the Theme Reviewers list (led by Chip Bennett) are
working to improve pages on the Codex related to theme development.

Specifically we want to improve the Theme Development Checklist and
Theme Unit Test data. The idea is to have three distinct pages:

1. Theme Coding Standards (replaces Theme Development Checklist): list
of general theme development guidelines.
2. Theme Unit Tests (currently bundled with checklist): link to sample
data with text to explain the purpose of each test.
3. Theme Directory Standards (currently at /Theme_Review): list items
specifically needed to submit a theme to WP.org directory.

At the same time, however, I'd like to make sure that we also review
related pages.

Could you help by listing any pages that relate to theme development
that *are not* listed below? Thank you!

http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU_Theme_Compatibility

While this page in particular is mostly obsolete, it does raise some 
points for people who release themes that may be used in a network of sites.

The whol page can go as the title is misleading. :D theme devs need to 
be aware of things like the edit_themes capped used for accessing theme 
options pages will prevent blog admins in a network from seeing those 
menus. That's pretty much it.

Chip probably knows about that tho. Just reminding. :)

This might be a good time to plug the new edit_theme_options capability in
3.0. Use it instead of switch_themes for options panels, unless the user
actually should be able to switch themes to be able to use your options
panel. We use it for menus, background, header, etc.

Tangently linked to development, but 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Themes/Theme_Compatibility and the linked 2.9 
page.  These "compatibility lists" AKA spam magnets have been phased out 
since the introduction of the theme and plugin broswers, but we could 
maybe do with something in there instead around the general issues of 
compatibility.

Fixed. Some of the function calls in MW are rather poorly named. I
would have thought that "updateExternalDB" would be self explanatory,
but when you actually go look through the MW code, it's not really

First: thanks for all the feedback! I'll be working on adding those items in.

Second: a quick update for you on the Codex reorganization for theme
development docs.

The main checklist (/Theme_Development_Checklist) has now been merged
to three other docs:

1. /Theme_Development - General code standards and best practices.
2. /Theme_Review - Guidelines for publicly releasing a theme via the
WP.org directory.
3. /Theme_Unit_Test - Theme testing data and related explanations.

This page will be merged into /Theme_Review:
- http://codex.wordpress.org/Designing_Themes_for_Public_Release

All the docs need copyediting and cleanup, which we'll be working next.

I'm sure I'm missed some.

A key issue to this is that you have three audiences to address, a common
problem with the Codex, which is why we set up the WordPress Lessons area,
giving beginners a safe place to start and covering topics in a very simple
fashion. While the basics might not apply to serious WordPress developers,
EVERYONE digs into their Theme at one time or another.

The three audiences are: beginners, experienced designers, and "the next
generation" developers, digging into the hooks, code, and customization,
creating their own rules as they go.

In general, the Codex serves to help the first two groups, but offer a solid
reference for the third. I'm glad your focus is on the middle group,
providing a "checklist" based reference. Eager to see the results.

Thank you so much, Lorelle! That list helps a ton.

We will not be able to clean up all theme-related pages at this time
-- that's way too big of a task. But, I do want to look at each and
every page that relates to themes so we can fix links and add pointers
to the new information.

So true. Theming -- like web design/development in general -- crosses
so many disciplines. And yes, even experienced developers need to have
a reference. :)

I agree that the focus of our efforts is on the second and third
audiences you mention, though I see them as one group (it just depends
on where they are in their design/development cycle).

On the theme-reviewers list we recently used the following to describe
the audience for this doc work: "For web designers wanting to make a
rock-solid WordPress theme -- perhaps for a client site or for
personal use -- *and* for theme developers wanting to create
rock-solid publicly-released themes for the WordPress directory."

So while the Theme_Review page will clearly be geared towards Theme
Directory submissions, I think the other pages getting updated (Theme
Development, Theme Unit Test) should be aimed at everyone working with
themes, except for absolute beginners (since the theme development
standards assume basic web design and development skills).

Quick question for everyone: what's the convention for the
capitalization of "theme" as a noun? I've seen it mostly uppercase in
the Codex, but it's not consistent on all pages. (My personal practice
is to use lowercase, but I'd rather stick with a Codex convention, if
there is one).

I looked here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines#Conventions

and here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Styles

Thanks,
-Lance

Theme and Plugin are capitalized and when possible, first referenced as a
WordPress Theme and then referenced as Theme or Plugin.

And don't forget your Ps. :D
