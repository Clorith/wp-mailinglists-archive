Hello,

I have added a documentation for add_term_meta() . If I am doing this
right, I will be moving forward with update_term_meta(), delete_term_meta()
and finally get_term_meta().

Here is the URL where the article is added:
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Abiralneupane/Function_Reference/add_term_meta

Regards

Hello Abiral,

It looks like you are doing a great job!

There is a plan to one day remove the function reference from the codex, in favor of the new code reference: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/

https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/developer-resources/code-reference/codex-migration/

But I think it is still helpful to have information about these new functions added to the codex, for people who do not use the new code reference yet.

Thank you for your contributions!

-J.D.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply - I appreciate that :)

After a long talk with some of the people at slack, I got a URL where I can
add a description. So here are those links:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_term_meta
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/update_term_meta

Also, someone told me that I can get a badge for contributing for
documentation. So, is there any eligibility to get that badge? like "after
adding 5 documentation, you will get a badge".

Getting a badge is an honor, so I really like to get that badge. Hope
that's not stupid of me :D

Thanks
