Whee!! Brand new list.

Brand new to-do :

A willing volunteer required to edit 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Manager

and make it a functional description of what the various options mean,
so that pages like
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_get_links make sense.

Lorelle brought up a good point here:

http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=24151

On principle I'm not suggesting we allow code hacks to be scattered through
the documentation, but perhaps a page, a code sandbox of sorts listing minor
modifications, wouldn't be out of order. Then at least we can reenforce some
protective steps, like backing up files, commenting changes, etc.

If it's scattered throughout, then we could have all Hacks marked with
some special div, and icon, or some such.

A new page with source-hacks could be done under the "Advanced Topics"
section on the main page.

Subject: [wp-docs] New Pages.
Message-ID: <80f75db050220235312144a23@mail.gmail.com>

I have a proposal regarding the creation of new pages:

The Problem:
Too many new pages, with titles that are all over the place, and that
are not linked-to from other pages.

Current Solution:
Create new pages as subpages of User: pages, and then move them in later.

Proposal:
1. Sysadmins and Bureaucrats should be able to move in pages as and
when they like, without having to check back and forth for speedier
development.
2. We need to agree on some standards for page titles and stick to the
standards.

Benefit: Speed up moving in of useful pages. Don't frustrate doc
writers (MDAWaffe comes to mind, among others :) )

Suggested Standards for Sysops, bureaucrats creating new pages:
1. Titles are in Title Case, so "Using the Link Manager" is used, not
"Using the link manager". (we need exactly one method, and this method
is already in vogue.)
2. Titles are action or task oriented whenever possible.
3. A new page should be relatively complete, containing useful
information that is immediately useful to the end user. No blank new
pages.
4. A new page should always be linked-to from some other page(s). No
bastard pages.
5. Titles shall not have leading or trailing spaces.
7. In case of doubt regarding the suitability of a name, mail the
wp-docs list asking for suggestions. Suggestions should be received in
less than two days. Hold your peace after two days :)
8. The page creator's title suggestion should be used as long as it is
sensible and does not violate any rules given here.
9. Shorter titles are better.
10. Avoid prepositions in Titles.

Exception:
Sub-pages are created after discussion, always.


If you have an opinion regarding these practices, voice them now,
within 5 days. Improve the rules above. Decision making threads like
this one should have a resolution, summarized in a mail to the thread,
at the end of 5 days (which is yet another proposal), unless there is
some special circumstance, which neccessitates extended discussion.

Carthik.

I've copied and slightly modified the information from

_Putting_the_Inter_in_the_Internet

and the pages it links to.  It's a lot of information (and more may be

Since we have this list back, let me emphasis that the best sort of 
thing for the codex is *task-based* documentation not structure-based. 
Task-based docs survive changes in the application better (menu items 
may move around a lot) and matches more how people use software.

I assume with my minor mod privileges I am one of the "bureacrats". In that case, may I ask we not be called that. Reasons should be apparent. Either moderator or sysop works for me.

To both points, I pretty much agree. On #1, earning the right to perform moves etc. should at least mean the earnee has gained an amount of trust from the sysadmins. #2 almost goes without saying, which means it must de said constantly.

1. As you say, this is already considered standard procedure. No (good) reason to change it.

2. May be hard to enforce, but hard also to disagree.

3. At this point most new pages, even moves from the old wiki, should fulfill this. However, if a writer/editor of a page is unsure of any information, they should use {{Stub}} and add a Talk note pointing out what they think is missing or requires a sanity check.

4. Same as 2. 

5. Are we getting a lot of these? Man...

6. MIA...

7. Now that we can... :)

8. I like this. Let's not make title changes simply on personal taste.

9. Yep.

10. More on brevity. Got it.

I hope this link works:

If anyone on the docs team adds this book to your wishlist and sends me 
a link to your wishlist (offlist) I'll be happy to buy it for you. I 
can't do everyone at once, but this is one of my favorite books -- 
fiction or non-fiction -- and I think it would be valuable to the

Ohh...well...*thinks*

Those should be fine, right now we need to focus our efforts on bastard
pages, orphans and imacculately conceptions can be delt with at a later
date. [insert other random stupidity here]

I suppose we could name the XFN page  "Using XFN" or "Defining

Either of these is fine by me.

Please suggest alternatives.

I would suggest "Default Templates" since one could add more templates
that these, and this fact could be included in the page as well.

Good point - Always follow common sense editing standards, especially
when you are a Sysadmin or moderator or editor.

That's the term that MediaWiki uses, so try not to take it too personally.

I think next week would be a good time to introduce a couple of 
resources on the Codex in a dev blog post, which of course would be 
syndicated to everyone's WordPress around the world.

What pages on the Codex would be a best introduction to the resource and 
would anyone like to write the post?

I'm not sure about the best pages on Codex, but if someone else can
make those suggestions, I'll be glad to take a whack at the
introduction, provided noone that has been more active in the
dev/hacking of WP wants the job.

Well, I would guess that anything to do with the new template system and the 
new/changed template tags would be good to feature. Certainly the installation 
instructions are quite good, and the overall functionality of MediaWiki versus 
phpWiki on the old site is something worth mentioning too.

Did I just volunteer to write something? Yeah? Okay, I'll write it, but would 
appreciate hearing some more input from you folks before diving in.

What date next week did you have in mind, Matt?

"Using XFN" is shorter, "Defining Relationships using XFN" is more 
descriptive...

I'm easy - either is also fine by me.  Also, if you think it's better 
for it to be rolled back into "Links Manager", I can do that.  I 
thought it was better served as its own page, but I can probably be 
convinced otherwise :)

With regards to style guidelines for title names, I'll just reiterate a 
couple of rules that I've mentioned before.

1. Titles should never begin with "How to," unless it is absolutely 
necessary to do so.
2. Titles which give instructions on how to do something should use 
verbs in the present participle (-ing) rather than present tense. For 
example, "Installing WordPress" should be used rather than "Install 
WordPress."
3. Titles which simply describe a subject ("Blog Design and Layout") or 
object ("Administration Panels") should use only nouns. (Note that 
"Design" and "Layout" can also be verbs, but in this example they are 
used as nouns.)

These rules are extremely standardized in the print world; any good 
reference book will adhere to them.

Oh, and one more:

4. As with "How to" and instructions, titles of articles which simply 
describe something (as noted in #3) should never begin with "About," 
One notable exception to this rule is "About WordPress," which would be 
insufficiently descriptive without the "About."

In case someone missed the URL of the style guidelines (which I presume 
Carthik is going to roll all of these suggestions into) it's this:

I agree that task-based articles are more frequently used. However, it  
is also worth noting that any good reference book on an application  
with a UI will have sections which simply describe the UI and give only  
general overviews on how to use it, and I think we would be remiss to  
exclude that from the Codex. It is also worth noting that task-based  
instructions need to be updated just as much as the more expository  
"tour" articles as the software evolves. It's my opinion that both are  
essential to a reference, even though instructions are the more  
frequently used.

"Defining Relationships With XFN" seems more correct to me for some 
reason. That could be backwards though. :-) (Also note the 
capitalization of 'With'; if we used 'Using' I'd suggest that it be 
capitalized as well.)

Fine by me.  With a broader title like that, obviously the page will 
need some more content (as it did anyway).

Good.  A section on including general components can be made (i.e.

"Defining Relationships With XFN", as Morgan suggests, sounds perfect 
to me.

I think just copying the info from the XFN page isn't useful, we should 
point people to the original resource, the page might be better if it 
explained why XFN is important in the context of WordPress, rather than 
duplicating information better found at the source.

The XFN whatnot was written to describe what people see when in the 
Links Manager.  In particular, the definitions were written up because 
I thought it wouldn't be obvious to most people to click on the 
"Profile" link from http://gmpg.org/xfn/ to find an explanation of what 
each relationship means.

A clearer link ("To find out what each of these relationships mean, 
click here") in WordPress' Links Manager itself would be useful, and 
would eliminate the need to for most of the information on the Codex 
page.

I don't know what you mean here.  It seems to me that XFN is no more 
important and is used no differently "in the context of WordPress" than 
anywhere else.  So, again, perhaps the page isn't useful.

You'll see I've edited in a funky "when in 1.2" section under Parameters
due to the removal of arguments for the tag in 1.5. (When were they
taken out?! I know they were still there at one point with the beta!!
~ahem~)

Do we want or need such references to 1.2 in cases like this? We still
have the old wiki for 1.2 users, though it's turned off so corrections
to the docs there are out of the question right now. I'm on the fence.

Personally, I'd like to say the Codex remain v1.5-only.  As far as I've 
seen the answer to most v1.2 support requests recently has been "upgrade 
to v1.5".  And, v1.5 is a recommended upgrade for all users.  Also, most 
of all of the regularly posting support forum users have made the jump 
to v1.5, so v1.2 will quickly loose favor in the forums.  I think we 
should plan to remove all v1.2 references from the Codex shortly after 
the release of v1.5.1.  This will clean up some of the clutter and help 
to avoid confusion.  We can always refer the v1.2 users to the Wiki if 
they're too stubborn to update.

Are you going to create a new wiki (containing much redundant 
information) for each version of WordPress? Or are you going to 
thoroughly purge the site of all help for old versions every time a new 
version is released?

If the answer to both those questions is "no", then eventually you will 
have to start including version-specific sections in some pages, and an 
"Applies to:" list of version numbers at the start of most others. If 
you don't, then in a few years, someone reading a page written in the 
WordPress 1.6 era will have no way of telling whether its instructions 
are still valid for Wordpress 3.0, or whether it's just that no-one has 
had time to update/delete it.

So I suggest adding version-specific sections to pages, if you feel 
like writing such sections (even if the WordPress 1.2 section says only 
"The easiest way to solve this problem is to upgrade to WordPress 
1.5"), or if the old information is written already.

If you don't feel like adding such sections, I suggest adding an 
"Applies to:" section to the top the page, containing a bulleted list 
of applicable versions. If the page no longer applies to Wordpress 1.5, 
then add a "Does not apply to:" section containing the single item "* 
WordPress 1.5 or later". Then when each new version of Wordpress is 
released, I can see by looking at those two lists whether a page is (a) 
applicable, (b) not applicable, or (c) not updated yet.

What might be cool is CSS in the wiki that tags things as "wp1_5" or 
"wp1_2_2", and then somehow set a custom stylesheet that hides things 
that are not applicable to a selected version, and highlights things 
that are specific to that version.

I think that the wiki should evolve with the software, and that each version 
should probably get it's own section. As Owen suggested, it might be nice to 
have version-specific CSS and/or other formatting that uniquely identifies 
documentation per version, where appropriate.

This is going to require some thought and further discussion. I look forward to 
hearing more ideas from everyone.

I think it's more likely we've already overthought this. 1.5 is the here 
now, and the base on which everything will be built on for a while, and 
the documentation for it needs work. Let's worry about incompatible 
documentation when 2.0 comes out. (Eg, not anytime soon.)

      May 2003: WordPress 0.7
  October 2003: WordPress 0.72 (substantially different from 0.7)
  January 2004: WordPress 1.0 (substantially different from 0.72)
      May 2004: WordPress 1.2 (substantially different from 1.0)
February 2005: WordPress 1.5 (substantially different from 1.2)

I know WordPress development is going to be a bit slower from now on.  
And I'm not suggesting that people write *new* stuff for outdated  
WordPress versions. I'm just suggesting that people add boilerplate  
version headers to pages they do write, so that you don't have to  
demolish or abandon the wiki sometime in 2006. And again in 2007. And  
again in 2008.

I visited the PAGES page several days ago after upgrading to 1.5  Not 
sure how I found it, but it was very helpful  I now know what a page is 
and how do do several things with it (password protect, listed in

Yes, it's very well written.

One thing, the NOMENCLATURE section at the bottom might be moved up 
closer to the top.

Password Protect:  Good one.  Anyone want to write it up?

As for the nomenclature section, it used to be almost first thing on 
the page.  I moved it to the bottom thinking it might annoy people at 
the top.  To each, his/her own :)

My own (fairly conservative) line is that nobody should be forced into 
upgrading unless there is an actual security risk involved in continuing 
to use their current version. There will be people who installed through 
Fantastico, people who rely on plugins that haven't yet been upgraded, 
and many, many people with an 'it ain't broke, why fix it?' attitude 
towards their installation, who may not have a spare afternoon right now 
in which to attend to an upgrade they don't think they need. If you take 
a look at the Blogwise stats 
(http://www.blogwise.com/stats/generators?full=wordpress) there are 
still a handful of 0.72 and even 0.7 installs out there. Regular forum 
posters are not typical Wordpress users, and outside that bubble 
adoption of new releases takes time.

As for directing 1.2 users to the old wiki; how long are you planning to 
run two documentation wikis concurrently? Don't you think this is more 
confusing for users than if there were only one? I also doubt very much 
that Codex _is_ 1.5-only; I found a couple of plugins listed there the 
other day with no indication that they'd been maintained beyond 1.2. 
Matthew's suggestion of labelling such material with the relevant 
version number seems to me a sensible way of handling this, and 
certainly far less confusing than having separate wikis.

The original question was whether the behaviour of template tags in 1.2 
should be documented alongside the 1.5. version. My own answer to that 
would be an unqualified 'yes'; if template functions have changed since 
the last release then the documentation should tell us so.

Should be back now. VERY sorry for the outage, I was out of town and the 
host cut it off. I didn't find out until I got back tonight to a million

Also, everything transferred over but some watchlists may have gotten 
messed up, as we were going between different versions of MySQL and some 
watchlists kept causing trouble.

Matt, it appears that the Codex cannot be edited.  The "Save page" 
button only shows a preview.

Subject: [wp-docs] Die Dead-end Project
Message-ID: <80f75db0502281210345455b7@mail.gmail.com>

For enterprising folks who would like to spend some time at the Codex:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Deadendpages 
lists dead end pages (d'uh :) )

Dead-end pages are pages that link to no other page on the Codex.
Please help fix this by visiting the listed dead end pages, and
finding and adding links to pages that might be relevant, in the
running text of the article, so that the usefulness of the articles
(which are now dead end articles) increases. In wikipedia terms, this
is a request to wikify these articles.

When linking to another article, check to make sure you are not
linking to an article that exists only as a Redirect.

This is not top proirity, but if you are bored, and want a project to
keep you busy for a couple of days and learn something about the pages
in Codex, this job is for you.

Thank you,
Carthik.
