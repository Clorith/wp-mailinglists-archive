Message-ID: <1133696631.11364.7.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I need to understand the WP database structure so I can migrate data
from an exiting phpWebSite site. I've had a look at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description but I think it would be
useful to have more information.

I'm quite happy to add more information as I work it out :-) Is it OK
for me to edit the Codex, or is there some sort of peer review process I
should go through?

Thanks - John

Having said that, when writing new articles it is best to draft them
first as sub articles on your userpage and have a few people go over
them before you add them to the Codex.

Welcome aboard!

Codex got hit twice by an automated junk mobile called boards2go. According
to the MediaWiki experts adding this to localsettings.php protects against
such attach:

  $wgSpamRegex="/overflow:\s*auto/

Also, could a sysop please 'take care of' the following users:
Lizator
Pizdorvan
Mariafelissa
Lycos

Hi all,

 

 I want to develop a Plug-in for Word press that enables the user to make
comments without refreshing or navigating to another page by using the AJAX
Technology. I need a hook / Filter that I use to override the default
behavior of the link for posting comments. Also I want to place my own code
into the page that displays the comments.

 

Please tell me which hook / Filter I have to capture in action function. 

 

Thanks in Advance  



Best Regards,

Tariq Rahim

Message-ID: <277801c60563$eaee1310$6402a8c0@DELL8600>

I'm struggling with revising the upgrade instructions for the 2.0 release.
See http://codex.wordpress.org/User:MichaelH/Revised_Upgrade_Instructions

Note:  the contents of this document will be put into the 'live' article
http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress when 2.0 is official.

Issues to address:
1.  Should the .htaccess file be backed up and what should be done with that
file once the upgrade is completed?
2.  What should be deleted or not deleted in wp-content?  We advise users
not to use FTP to overwrite files so what should be the recommended
approach?
3.  How to address the permission issues regarding the wp-db-backup.php
plugin?

Thanks for any input.

Yes.

> and what should be done with that file once the upgrade is completed?

Ideally, any backup one makes prior to upgrading should be able to be
dropped back in place to revert to the previous version, should the
upgrade fail.

If the backup is successful, and the upgrade goes smoothly, then the new
rules should be generated and we're all done.  If the upgrade does not
go smoothly, the user can rever to their previous version using the
backup while they solicit help in the forums.

> plugin?

"If you want to use the Backup plugin, you'll need to make sure that
your /wp-content/ directory is writable by your webserver.  This means
changing it to mode 666 (or possibly 777)."

Yes, it must be backed up.
Keep it IF needed, esp if custom rules have been added.

Just upload the new plugin ?

Do not upgrade ? :)

I want Matt to take this one and get the words right - I have written
something but my work is outside Codex. Matt chose to take this route so
I think he should craft the words.

I thought of that but then there's wp-content/plugins/akismet,
wp-content/index.php, and the changes to wp-content/plugins/hello.php.

And looks like there's changes to the default and Classic theme files.
Should those theme files be uploaded and if so should the original files be
first deleted?

Subject: [wp-docs] 2.0 release: December 26
Message-ID: <43A9D8D9.3080007@skippy.net>

At today's IRC meetup, it was agreed to postpone the release of
WordPress 2.0 until December 26, in order to iron out a few remaining
bugs, and also to get some user documentation prepared.

MichaelH has already documented the new user permission system.  Hooray!

We need also:
* upgrade documentation
* walk-through of the new post interface
* media management
* probably lots more

Anything else?  Any volunteers for this stuff, or has someone started
some of these already?

Cheers,
Scott

Upgrade instructions being revised at

That page will replace http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress and
any upgrade details for versions other than 1.5 to 2.0 will be moved into
another page.

Michael, for reference, the codex does not send password via email, at least
myself and one other has mentioned that in this mail list.  Not to mention
Viper said he didn't receive his email.

Message-ID: <ee4685de0512271610g40ba563fp70e7512a5b7079cf@mail.gmail.com>

Well, I thought that I was being clever and changed my skin setting
for the Codex back to the original "MonoBook" skin, mostly because I
currently prefer it to the new skin.  Unfortunately, all of the Codex
pages are blank now.  When I am not logged in, the Codex appears as it
should with the new skin.  But, when I am logged in as "MacManX", all
of the pages are completely blank.  Does anyone here have back-end
access?  If so, would you mind resetting my choice of Codex skin? 
Thanks in advance!

So _that's_ why I've been unable to see the Codex all day!

Also, please restore the monobook theme.  Choice is good, and the only
people who are going to want to enforce a local preference are those who
use the Codex regularly.

That helps us see the pages, but if our preferences have defined the
monobook skin, we're back to a blank page as soon as we log in.

I'd really like to update the list of 2.0 compatible plugins, but I
can't.  I'm not going to make a new account for myself to do this.

Who has access to the server, aside from Matt?  Are we completely
reliant on his whims to fix this stuff?  I'm getting exasperated.

A few updates on the site:

* Visited links, spacing, is fixed on the forums
* Donncha fixed the email problems
* Search has been restored, temporarily with the old design
* Codex links have been added to the sidebar, but it still hasn't been 
switched to the flexible with version of the design. Lots of work needed 
there.
* I fixed the Monobook skin for those of you using that.
* Links on the front page now go places
* DNS issues with downloads.wordpress and search.wordpress should be fixed

Now I've got to run before I miss my flight.

Thanks Matt!  Almost had a meltdown not being able to edit Codex ;)

MonoBook has been restored as a theme, so we should all be able to
view the Codex in its glorious original theme now.

Sorry, Viper, I wish I could reset your password, but I can't.  Isn't
there a Codex admin around here somewhere?  Are you sure that you have
tried everything?

The ONLY person who can change anyone's password is Matt. Not sysops,
Matt. It has to be done directly in the database.

Yep, the e-mail recover doesn't work from what I hear and I haven't 
gotten any of the e-mails. Firefox lost my randomly generated password 
or something, hence my problem. :/

I'm in the same boat with needing a new password again. My memory is  
foggy on this, but wasn't Forum, Trac and Codex passwords all tied  
together? Single password sign-on?

Not Codex. Trac and Forum had a single sign on.

I just came across the inline picture things with the class of tright 
that I hadn't styled before because they weren't in the pages I tested 
the CSS with.

If you come across something in the Codex that needs some stylesheet 
luvin' send a note to this list and I'll fix it up.
