A new page was created recently

http://codex.wordpress.org/Free/Open_Source_Theme_Frameworks

I'm fairly unsure about this.  We've taken a firm line on linking off to 
plugins and such from the Codex because of the inbuilt browsers.

I'm somewhat concerned that this page is going to be yet another list of 
external links, with people cramming it full of their own pages for SEO.

Should we delete this?

Couldn't it just be merged into a new section in the Theme Frameworks [1]

Yes, and possibly move its content elsewhere if there is anything
worth salvaging.

The /Free/ bit in the URL makes it into clear and present spam.

Can we redirect it to the freemium themes page?

Bloody #REDIRECT [[pagename]] only works for internal pages...

Why redirect it? What is pointing to it?

After you move the content elsewhere, the page should be deleted
entirely. It doesn't fit with anything else on the codex, it doesn't
follow proper naming conventions.

Nothing. 

Looks like the author added it as a link from Theme Frameworks, which actually has the rest of that info.

I think the Free/... Part was just cause he didn't know how wikis work.

I say just delete the page.

Hi all.  I've run across a number of broken codex pages in Chrome this 
weekend (stylesheet and other resources don't load).

Chrome gives this warning:
[blocked] The page at 
https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_menu_page ran 
insecure content from http://s.wordpress.org/style/codex-wp4.css?3.

Appears to be an issue with the SSL certificate?

The page appears fine in Firefox.

Here's an example page:
https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_menu_page

Cheers,
Devin Price

Why are you accessing the codex pages using https? Use the http link
instead. That one works fine.

Hi Otto.  When I search for the term "add menu page" in Google, the first
result is a codex link with "https" rather than "http".

See: https://www.google.com/search?q=add+menu+page

If search results weren't sending people there, I don't think it would be a
problem.  Is it possible to add canonical tags to the codex to direct
results to http versus https?

I'm not sure why Google is indexing the site that way, and adding
rel:canonical would be difficult at the moment (blasted mediawiki).

For the moment, just be aware of it. Not much I can change about it right now.

I checked and you can't force http in MediaWiki

(I suppose you could hardcode the CSS into the MediaWiki theme to use http)

What about using protocol-less URLs for stylesheets?

<style>
@import url("//wordpress.org/style/codex-wp4.css?3");
@import url("//wordpress.org/style/wp4.css?22");
</style>

This would load http or https depending on what the URL is.

The static caching system we use to serve static resources
(s.wordpress.org) doesn't support https. We wouldn't be able to use
protocol-less URLs and continue using the static server, which we're
very fond of.

Message-ID: <CADZaJgOAyP2UL_V-0+y=+YP4xGP_J6E8YCyrdYzAFiKZoKWE5A@mail.gmail.com>

Quick question for y'all -- does something like this warrant a link back
from the Codex?

http://wpacademy.tv/ww3.htm

Please note the first four free modules including the "WordPress basic
training sequence".  I believe this might be the world's first true
WordPress "Help Manual" (meaning a collection of hyperlinked topics with an
expanding / collapsing table of contents, as in Winhelp or Java Help)

A note about the technology used.  It is an integration of help authoring
software (Help & Manual) with a WordPress membership site.  I am making
this technology available for free to any open-source or public-interest
projects, however I doubt that it would be useful for this purpose, as it
is not a multi-authoring system.  It's also not public domain code, the H&M
software is about $500 and it uses the Thesis theme ($100) and Wishlist
Member (also $100).

I am always looking for ways to collaborate with open-source projects,
including donating this or any of our other content to Codex, so let me
know if you have any ideas to marc at wpacademy.tv.

Thanks,

Marc

I'm sure an official voice will come in and give you the definitive answer,
but I can tell you from vast experience, the answer to a link from the
Codex is no.

I believe we've had these discussions with wpacademy.tv in the past, or
something similar. There are many such sites and services, and the names
are so similar. There have been many "help manuals" and training and video
programs for WordPress over the years.WordPress has Learn WordPress, an
official source of organized videos and tutorials, and WordPress.tv
resources, and we've been working on bringing videos into the WordPress
Codex for a long time as well.

The WordPress Codex does not link to commercial sites as a rule. Please
review the http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines regarding external
links. You've clearly stated that this is not public domain code and has a
cost.

If you would like to pursue this further, contact the WordPress Foundation
as they may be able to help you in other ways. There are many ways to
contribute to the WordPress Community beyond the Codex.

Good luck with your project and thank you for asking.

Lorelle

Thanks Lorelle, but with all due respect (and not to get into an extended
debate on this, but possibly to hear some other voices), the Codex links to
at least three commercial providers of documentation here:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_More_Help
(In "other helpful resources" at the bottom)

and I would humbly (or maybe not so humbly, what the heck) suggest that the
publication of the world's  first true WordPress "Help Manual" (as in
Winhelp and Java Help) is, what, significant?  Worthy of letting people
know about it?

"Clearly stated this is not public domain and has a cost" - this is for the
documentation platform, I mention this merely for the curious.  The first
four modules of our WordPress LMS are free (http://wpacademy.tv/ww3.htm).
And yes there is an upgrade cost.

What do some other people think?

Thanks

Marc

Generally it is better to enhance the specific article in Codex rather than
just adding links to external sites.

I've updated this page with official links that meet with the guidelines.
Thank you for pointing out the links. If you find any others, please bring
them to our attention, or you may contribute to the Codex by editing and
removing them yourself and replacing them with links that meet our
guidelines. We are always eager to help new volunteers on the Codex learn
more about how it works, and cleaning up dead links and such is a great way
to get started.

As Michael said, adding valuable information to the Codex is always
appreciated.

Please contact the WordPress Foundation for ways to help the WordPress
Community. They may have some excellent suggestions.

Again, thanks for asking.

I'd like to add that one easy way you can get involved and have your
contribution count right away is to join us in working on the new user
manual project <http://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/>.  Several
of us are building this document as we speak, and because it is aimed
directly at WordPress newbies (who need clear and simple instruction) and
may be a better fit for you than working on the Codex in general.  For sure
your video topics appear to speak to absolute beginners.

Learn more here:
http://make.wordpress.org/support/2012/09/chat-summary-sept-6/

Several of us are also do screencasts, and there is talk of adding that
into the User Manual at some point, but no initiatives yet.  In the
meantime, we'd love your help with the written documentation, and it will
definitely earn you some karma points in the community.

Thanks to everyone for thoughtful replies.

My real issue is that I don't think of standard Wiki as an effective
platform for writing documentation.  Better is Media Wiki:

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki

Which is still quite a bit behind commercial help authoring software,
because in commercial help authoring software when you hyperlink into a
topic, the Table of Contents on the left opens up to that topic (see
http://wpcademy.tv/ww3.htm) .  (Perhaps you think this is a "nice feature",
but for me it is key.  I am a perfectionist which is the reason I became a
technical writer in the first place and certainly the reason that I am as
successful at it as I am)

Has there been any interest or any discussion in building a Wordpress
manual on Media Wiki?  I could get behind that.

In fact, the WordPress Codex is powered by MediaWiki:

mm, sorry for wasting everyone's time, let me take up this conversation
privately.

I am just trying to understand if its possible to have a Wiki-compatible
(multiple-authors) system that does what Winhelp does.  Winhelp is the
documentation format for virtually all commercial software for a reason, I
would love it if we could do something similar for WordPress

As noted above, there's two ways you can contribute:

- jump in to the codex and start writing / editing / correcting information

- help with the user manual, which right now is a bunch of HTML pages.

This may or may not change. there are PLENTY of pages right now we need
people to edit so we can push an official user guide to actual users.
That's way more important to use that what software is used to produce it
(at this time).

If you really want to jump in, get working, and earn a name for yourself,
the user manual is the best place to start. We would honestly love to have
you contribute. See this page
http://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/ for
the current work list and you can also let me know personally which ones
you'd like to start with. We have a weekly chat in IRC on Thursdays at 5pm
Eastern for discussing specifics.

Guys,

I do appreciate your invitations and believe me, the "gears are turning".
The issue for me -- please allow me to speak plainly and if offense is
taken I apologize in advance  -- is that IMHO Wiki and Media Wiki are not
suitable platforms for writing technical documentation, and perhaps one of
the reasons why the WordPress documentation is not up to the same quality
as WordPress code.  But I've been seriously thinking about this, what needs
to happen (again IMHO) is an open-source Winhelp-clone system powered by
WordPress, that would be equivalent to my semi-proprietary system see for
instance:

http://wpacademy.tv/about-wordpress-webinar-marathon.htm

But would also be multi-authoring (which mine is not).  I think its doable,
we just need to find coders, I can project-manage perhaps.  Lorelle you
know some of the people at wordpress.tv.,  I have an old email of yours
that mentions some major documentation effort happening there, can you send
me personal mail marc at wpacademy.tv with that information again?   Anyone
else interested as well, just let me know, this would be WAY cool if we
could pull it off.

Thanks

Marc

"what needs to happen (again IMHO) is an open-source Winhelp-clone system
powered by WordPress,"

The user manual I mentioned above is powered by WordPress.

I do appreciate your ideas and enthusiasm. Right now, we want to see the
user guide pushed out ASAP. Then we can talk about if & when and how to
make the actual docs later.

I appreciate everyone's feedback and assistance. At this point I think my
best contribution is to develop an open-source documentation platform
capable of holding the quality of documentation that I would like to
contribute rather than making contributions into a legacy system (ie a
system that is not up to par with commercial systems).  My aim is to do
make something similar to the semi-proprietary system that I have developed
http://wpacademy.tv/ww3.htm but in GPL and multi-authoring and based on
Wordpress as the master repository (my system uses H&M as master
repository).  Anyone who wants to join me please write marc at wpacademy.tv.
I have also contacted WordPress Foundation as per Lorelle's direction.
thanks
Marc

I'd recommend almost anything *but* a "winhelp clone". For me, a
platform-specific format (especially Windows) both goes against the spirit
of WordPress and is a cumbersome, anachronistic way of doing things.

I've developed Windows help since--well, since there was a Windows. I've
also created technical documentation for 20 years or so. Tool-wise, the
answer is always "what creates something that helps the user be the most
successful?" I think the answer can be provided with many tools, including
WordPress or a wiki.

If I were to pick one thing WordPress users likely want most, it's the
ability to search and find clear, specific answers to specific questions.
And, if I were to change only one thing about the Codex, for example, I'd
add more visuals.

Message-ID: <CAEbnL98o_EQ4g6a_6iNimGXkcxnyP4pYmFuhDwPR1QDyLsUqMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

The codex page here
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/stripslashes_deep that
to my eyes gives terrible advice. I consider myself to be ann
"intermediate" level coder, so I'd like some feedback before making
edits here. First, the example recommends get_magic_quotes_gpc() but I
understand this to be unreliable, especially in a WordPress
environment (WordPress emulates and "turns on" magic quotes
regardless), and second, it gives example code $_POST =
stripslashes_deep( $_POST ); which seems like it'd be especially bad
practice... or am I wrong?

Thanks,
Ken

A senior coder here is going to edit it. Feel free to review his
changes and/or discuss on this thread, I'll forward it on :)

James, by "Winhelp clone" i mean any system that provides the Winhelp /
Javahelp functionality.  This is the way that virtually all professional
software is documented and there is a reason for that (which you know about
since you work in this area) -

- Expanding/collapsing table of content (TOC) in left frame, any depth
(helps user understand where they are in the content hierarchy)
- Search and Index tabs in left frame TOC
- Hyperlinking to any topic in the main window opens up the left TOC for
that topic (again, helps user understand where they are in the content
hierarchy and keeps a trail)
- Easily add rich content such as images, videos, and toggles (image
thumbnails that popup to larger size or else blocks of text that can get
expanded)

I have an idea for doing this via a WordPress theme / plugin combination.
It's a rather exciting idea to me.  Once again if anyone else likes this
idea and wants to participate you can email me marc at wpacademy.tv

To note that the usage or existence of a high-quality documentation
platform does not guarantee the generation of high-quality documentation,
but in my case, I can certainly say that it helps with motivation.  I
personally find it very hard to work in Wiki (images and rich media are
particularly cumbersome, with the results that we see) and IMHO this is the
main reason that WordPress documentation lags way behind the WordPress
code.  I totally agree "find clear specific answers to specific problems",
the answer to that problem is Winhelp, and particularly Winhelp in
combination with "Tooltip help" or help topics that are linked from each
relevant dashboard page (which is the next iteration of this, I think)

I have to say I am a bit frustrated by lack of understanding / support of
this idea in this forum.  Perhaps (for sure), this conversation started on
a different topic, and perhaps this is not the right forum for new
development suggestions as y'all working really hard to support the current
structure.  What I am suggesting is that the current structure is not
optimal and that we can do much better. I would argue also that I can speak
authoritatevely about this since I make quite a good living providing
Wordpress documentation, which I am willing to contribute to Codex (but not
within a legacy platform as it would be too much work for me for
insufficient result)

Thanks

I'd recommend almost anything *but* a "winhelp clone". For me, a
platform-specific format (especially Windows) both goes against the spirit
of WordPress and is a cumbersome, anachronistic way of doing things.

I've developed Windows help since--well, since there was a Windows. I've
also created technical documentation for 20 years or so. Tool-wise, the
answer is always "what creates something that helps the user be the most
successful?" I think the answer can be provided with many tools, including
WordPress or a wiki.

If I were to pick one thing WordPress users likely want most, it's the
ability to search and find clear, specific answers to specific questions.
And, if I were to change only one thing about the Codex, for example, I'd
add more visuals.

Again, it's not a lack of understanding.

I've previously pointed you to where a lot of work was going on with the
user handbook.

Specifically you may wish to read this post:
http://make.wordpress.org/support/2012/08/post-hoc-ergo-propter-hoc-approaching-and-defining/

where we have been discussing this very thing. Indeed, the whole Support
blog is full of posts awaiting your input.

There is now a core Support & Docs team, with Mika (Ipstenu), Esmi and
myself as leads. We've been having ongoing discussions as to how to best
approach documentation, while actually working on docs and support, and we
also have a weekly IRC chat that you are more than welcome to attend and
take part in, where there are a number of other professional documentation
and support people involved. The chat is on Thursdays at 5pm Eastern.

You may have read before the WordPress is a meritocracy. We judge user
contributions by a combination of the quality of someone?s contributions,
and their level of interest/time commitment will determine how much
influence they have over decisions.

Over the past few years that I have been involved, the topic of software
for support docs has come up time and again, but the overriding immediate
need is writing and editing the docs to begin with.

The USer Handbook is being written with WordPress - which we both can agree
is easier to work with than the Codex and should not slow down
contributions. We'd be happy to make you an Editor and you can get right to
work as soon as you let me know which parts for the user handbook you'd
like to edit.

Marc, we do understand.

Here's where we are, however.

1) The Wiki is a base level start, anyone can edit, and we have it. We would like to make it as good as we can. You can use most basic HTML in a wiki, and if you need help with uploading images, you can ask us for help :) some of us (hi) happen to be pretty savvy at MediaWiki.

2) Our current attack is on the user manual, over at the make.wordpress.org/support site, and the vast majority of energy is being spent there. I would love to have you help us. It's using WordPess, which I'm sure you know how to use.

After that, sure, we may all want to look into something else, but there is a finite limit to how thin you can stretch a group of volunteers. If you really want to grab this one and run with it, go for it! But know what our current goals are and that you may not, right now, get the traction you want.

Besides, you're forgetting a keystone of Open Source. We move at the speed of passion. If you have a passion, go then! :D No ones stopping you from coming up with that.  We Appreciate your passions and support them, if not always as hands on as you may like.

Andrea, Mike --

all clear.  I understand.  I think the WP-base documentation is already
huge improvement.  Thanks for all the links, let me have a look,  and I
will join you on IRC sometime.

Cheers,

We put in a couple notes, an alternative example and a couple warnings
("please note"s), but didn't remove the originals (just clarified the
situations where they'd be bad.

Subject: [wp-docs] Page translation howto?
Message-ID: <5065392A.90402@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm a recent user of WordPress (theme developpment) and I like the tool! 
I would like to contribute to the codex translation so I subscribed to 
the wordpress forum. I read the "How to contribute" page (in the 
maintenance page I didn't find anything about translation) and created 
main own page as mentionned : http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Jojaba
I don't want to create new pages, only provide translation of existing 
pages.
My question : how should I do that ? Should I just click on the "add my 
language" link in the page I would like to translate and go on with the 
work ? Is there something else I should do to have other pages pointing 
to that fresh translated page taking it in account ?

Thanks in advance for your help. :)

Tbh, I think a lot of this should just be binned in favour of pointing 
people towards CSS specific resources like W3Schools or css-discuss. 
Since WP uses CSS in exactly the same way as any static site, I think 
it's well outside the Codex's scope to start trying to teach it on one page.

Perhaps it would be better to have something along the line of:

What is CSS?
Where is the CSS in My Theme?
Where is the CSS in this Plugin?
Where can I Learn More About CSS?
Useful Tools

Thoughts?

Well since I found it, maybe we can jointly work on it? :)

In for a penny, in for a pound.

I have a draft of that page mostly done as it has long been on my to do
list. When I get back to my office later today, I'll forward it to you,
esmi, if you are interested. You'd probably write the same things. That's
really close to the structure I had set, if memory serves.

I really need to clean up all the partial drafts...more life and time! :D

Thanks for asking and welcome to the Documentations team.

There are many options for working with translations in WordPress, and on
the Codex.

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language lists WordPress in
various languages.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress describes different ways
you can contribute through translations to WordPress, from core
translations of the program to docs.

http://translate.wordpress.org/projects is a list of translation projects
by the polyglots team, the translation team, for WordPress made up of
volunteers from around the world.

http://translate.wordpress.org/getting-started is their how to help and get
started guide.

http://make.wordpress.org/polyglots is the discussion and news
announcements site for the translation team.

You need to get involved with the polyglots group, not so much us, though
we're glad you are here. They direct translation and localization projects
and tasks. They will help you.

Thanks for contributing to WordPress and for asking! Good luck and have fun!

Lorelle

Hi!

For translating the Codex pages specifically, the information you need is
right here:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Multilingual_Codex

Merci et bienvenu ;)
