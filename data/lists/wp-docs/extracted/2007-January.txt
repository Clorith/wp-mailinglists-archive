I don't know where that came from, it always said to not overwrite
wp-contents...

I do know that the detailed instructions give this info, and it was always a
point of contention as to what the upgrade instructions should be.  If my
memory serves me correctly, Matt didn't want the basic upgrade instructions
to include the delete everything but wp-config and wp-content, then upload
new files instruction.  So perhaps in the editing, the important step of not
overwriting wp-content was left out.

I've CC'd this to wp-docs, perhaps Michael H or someone else who still
manages the codex will look into it.

in the context of the whole instructions it is a lot less scary, but I
imagine still something that a worksmith will improve. (Many of the
FTP clients on Mac also work with a UNIX/Windows interpretation of

Subject: [wp-docs] Codex updates for 2.1?
Message-ID: <45AE43C7.4040602@poplarware.com>

I am cross-posting this to the Hackers and Docs lists, because I think 
it may require input from both communities.

Being a programmer who loves clear documentation, I've been looking 
over the about-to-be-released code for WordPress 2.1, and I have 
noticed that several things have changed that a plugin or theme 
developer would want to know (new filters, some functions deprecated, 
etc.). I have also noticed that the Codex could probably use a bit of 
reorganization (it looks like several people have discussed this 
recently in the Docs list archives; I just joined the list).

So what I am wondering is:

a) Are there plans to update the developer section of the Codex for 
2.1 changes? I didn't see any in the Docs list archives for Dec/Jan, 
and I just joined the list, so I am not sure.

b) I am also wondering if it might make sense to start a whole new 
developer area in the Wiki for 2.1, and in the process, reorganize the 
existing developer documentation a bit.

c) Once 2.1 is out, will the Wiki need to keep around all the 
information for 2.0.x as well?  For how long? And do we need some 
documentation on the changes (such as what a developer needs to do to 
ensure plugin and theme migration, avoid deprecated functions, etc.)?

Thoughts? And yes, I am offering to help, and maybe even to organize 
projects around this...

OK... In that case, I will see about starting a re-organized 2.1 
Developer Doc section, including a migration from 2.0 section, and 
plan to leave the 2.0 documentation section alone (although once there 
is actual content in the 2.1 section, link(s) from the 2.0 sections 
will be useful).

Unless I hear otherwise...

As with all releases, information specific to the new release will be added as
soon as all the information is available, and a volunteer kicks in with the
writing. Are you volunteering? ;-)

Reorganization and updating is a constant ongoing effort on the WordPress Codex. 

If you would like to help, jump in and let us know specifically what you want to
do, fix, improve, and add. We're thrilled to have you involved.

Make sure you read through the information on how to add content to the WordPress
Codex so the format stays uniform and have a go at it. We have volunteers who
will review and edit the content to make sure it stays within those parameters,
so there is a strong checks and balances.

Welcome to the group and we'd love help on this. Thanks.

Lorelle

OK, here goes.  As a developer, I have a suggestion for a 
reorganization of the Developer Resources page 
(codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation). I'm hereby volunteering 
to (a) reorganize and (b) at least do some of the 2.1 rewrites.

I suggest separating Developer Resources into the following sections:
*   Theme Development
*   Plugin Development
*   Contributing to WordPress
*   Forums, Lists & Blogs [anyone with a better title idea here?]

Probably codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page should just point developers to 
the main Developer Resources page, rather than maintaining links in 
the Developers section there too (my experience has been that anything 
maintained in more than one spot is likely to get out of synch).

Here are what I would suggest putting into each section (mostly 
existing pages):

Theme Development
*   Theme Development (codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development) [There 
are a BUNCH of overlapping articles in the Codex about Theme 
development, and it would be useful to clean it up somewhat. Next 
project...]
*   Designing Themes for Public Release 
(codex.wordpress.org/Designing_Themes_for_Public_Release)
*   Distributing your Theme (themes.wordpress.net)
*   Coding Standards (codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)
*   Template Tags (codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) [2.1 update needed]
*   Conditional Tags (codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags) [2.1 
update needed]
*   Function Reference (codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference) [2.1 
update needed]
*   Migrating Themes and Plugins from 2.0.x to 2.1 [new]
*   Finding Existing Themes (themes.wordpress.net)

Plugin Development
*   Writing a Plugin (codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin)
*   Coding Standards (codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)
*   Distributing your Plugin [make separate page? currently part of 
Writing, but I think it deserves its own page]
*   Hooks, Actions, and Filters (codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API) [2.1 
update needed]
*   Function Reference (codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference) [2.1 
update needed]
*   Migrating from 2.0.x to 2.1 [new]
*   Find Existing Plugins (wordpress.org/extend/plugins)

Contributing to WordPress
*   Contributing to WordPress 
(codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress)
(this article has great links already, not sure if they should all be 
listed separately in the developer area)

Forums, Lists & Blogs
*   WordPress Blog (wordpress.org/development)
*   WordPress Planet (planet.wordpress.org)
*   Support Forum (wordpress.org/support)
*   IRC Channels (codex.wordpress.org/IRC)
*   Mailing lists (codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists)

Comments? Thoughts?

I do not think the Wiki currently being used for the Codex will 
support that, but it is a nice idea.

Looks good to me. I hope others will add their opinions.

We have a little bit of clarification on WordPress Themes. WordPress Themes come
in two flavors of technical support: helping those who know not what they do but
want to do it anyway, and building your own Theme.

The WordPress Lessons and Blog Design sections cover the first group fairly well,
though new material dedicated to them is always welcome. However, a section on
WordPress Theme Development dedicated specifically to those who want to develop
Themes for public release is great to expand upon under the Development section.

I'm totally thrilled with the Plugin and Theme distribution articles. I've been
begging for those for quite some time. Those definitely fit under Development.

How does that sound? 

I have plans to update the whole table of contents, so don't get too focused on
that as much as filling in the blanks as you've listed them. Have at the
Development section, but stay tuned for some changes to the rest of the TOC structure

One last remember. I'm on the team that believes that a new manual doesn't have
to be written for every version. The older articles are great and just need
updated information, so focus on integration into the existing or new
documentation. No reason to throw out the baby and the bath water.

And thanks for jumping in on this.

Yes, of course. I would not want to mess with the user-pointing 
documentation on Themes, just the developer-pointing documentation.

OK, will do. I still think that maintaining a TOC for developers in 
two spots is prone to problems.

Well, the articles that need to have major updates for 2.1, on 
functions and such for developers, are in pretty sad shape for the 
2.0.x version anyway. Also, for function references, keeping track in 
one article of functions from both versions is VERY confusing to the 
reader (in my opinion, as a developer). So I will try to just 
integrate as much as possible, but I think the function reference 
articles do need to be kept separate.

Subject: [wp-docs] Duplicated article lists...
Message-ID: <45B17004.3080300@poplarware.com>

I've been working this week on cleaning up and editing documentation 
for theme, plugin, and core WordPress developers (it's coming along). 
Also updating for version 2.1.

What I've come across is that there are quite a few Codex pages that 
are overlapping lists of articles. For instance, the following pages 
contain lists of resources related to Theme development, and have no 
actual content:

* http://codex.wordpress.org/Templates (fairly comprehensive)
* http://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_Design_and_Layout (some sections)
* http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons (two sections are 
related to themes and templates)
* http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation (one section on 
Themes)
* http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page (of course, the main page also 
duplicates several sections of the above)

I'm concerned because each of these lists has different articles, and 
there is not one sole source to look at for a comprehensive list. 
Also, some of the lists are not annotated, so you don't really know 
what you will find when you click on the link (it could just lead you 
to another page of links, or an article that is aimed at the wrong 
audience). Not to mention that many content-rich articles also have 
links to a few resources for further reading, where they could just 
point the user back to the comprehensive, organized, annotated list of 
resources.

So, can some of these be consolidated? For instance, maybe Blog Design 
and Layout could be the main place for design/layout articles, and 
Templates (instead of having any layout sections) could simply point 
to that page. Obviously, any articles linked to from the wordpress.org 
home page, or from the codex.wordpress.org sidebar, need to remain!

Thoughts? Is it OK if I go ahead and consolidate the developer-facing 
documentation in that way? (I'll stay away from the Main Page for now).

I'm glad you brought this up, Jennifer.  There was some discussion on 
this list at the start of December (before you joined?).  Matt replied 
to my message on the topic by saying "it'd be nice if the links on the 
front page of wordpress.org and more links on the Codex homepage took 
you directly to content."  If Matt wants those pages cleaned up, I'd 
guess that he (and others) would agree with fixing more-minor pages. 
But, as I read in a discussion somewhere else (I've lost track of 
where), some people do like this system of links-to-links.

I'm new to WordPress, so my advice could be shortsighted.  Still, I'll 
try. ;-)  Instead of replacing the pages, you might put revised page(s) 
in a temporary location so people can have a look.  If they look good, 
you could install them in the most likely location -- and revise the 
obsolete pages of links to say "this page has moved to NEW-LOCATION". 
(I can't think of a way to maintain compatibility with the old system of 
multiple overlapping pages.  Suggestions, anybody?)

If anyone disagrees, I hope this message will encourage them to say so!

Good Morning.

In anticipation of 2.1 I'm trying to do "Upload file" with some new
screenshots of the Installation process, but I get a message "The file you
uploaded seems to be empty. This might be due to a typo in the file name.
Please check whether you really want to upload this file."

I tried this with a file called testup.png so don't thing the file name is
wrong.

Also asked another volunteer to try the upload and they had the same
problem.  Using codex or monobook skin makes no difference.

This is likely a problem for Matt but wondered if anyone else had any idea?

Thanks.

Actually, I think it's appropriate for the wordpress.org front page 
links to take you to a good table of contents. I'm also in favor of 
having different tables of contents at different levels of detail -- 
for instance, the Codex home page could link to the TOC on Themes, the 
TOC on Plugins, etc. And the Dev TOC could also link to both of those 
TOCs. This all seems like a good idea, as long as the links to TOCs 
are annotated to say "this is a list of all the good links on a subject".

What I'm against is having multiple tables of contents on the same 
topic, with slightly different lists of links, because when someone 
goes to add a new page, they'll never manage to add it to all the 
TOCs, and then an interested reader won't be able to find relevant 
pages. And so I would like to clean those up, consolidate them, etc. I 
think most of the existing pages make sense as subject headers, but 
they have expanded to overlap each other.

By the way, there's a right sidebar link in the Codex to see what 
pages are linking to a given page, so it's not impossible to fix 
inappropriate links.

Hi,

What is the official position on support of older versions of WordPress?

Should information relating to older versions be removed from the Codex?
For example, this page:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_excerpt_rss

has a section on parameters for version 1.2.


And a completely unrelated question: Why can I post to wp-docs, but when
I try to post to wp-testers it never shows up?

Don't see any harm removing it. But then again what's the harm in leaving
it?

Looks like wp-testers at lambic.co.uk is subscribed to the testors list?

Rule #4 of the Codex Guidelines: Edit mercilessly. ;)

Yes, I've tried sending email to that list using wp-testers at
lambic.co.uk, but it never appears.

Subject: [wp-docs] 2.1 compatible theme list..
Message-ID: <45BB8C85.40607@gmail.com>

Would it be possible for someone to add the link to the 2.1 Compatible 
theme's list, on the Codex page under the new 2.1 section?
http://codex.wordpress.org/Themes/Theme_Compatibility/2.1

Was just wondering..  I had to search the codex to find it. Figured it 
might get more "love" if it was right on the Codex's Main page.. ;):)
