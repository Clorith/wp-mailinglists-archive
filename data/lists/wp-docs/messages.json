This\nwill add a rule to the .htaccess file when the rules are hard flushed.\nadd_rewrite_rule('myrule', '/newlocation');\nIn WordPress, all \"internal\" rewrite rules must start with \"index.php\"\nfor them to work properly. Any rule that doesn't start with index.php\ngets shoved out into the .htaccess file as a normal RewriteRule when\nthe flush happens (basically when you visit the Settings-\u003ePermalink\npage).\nSo you can use normal add_rewrite_rule calls to add normal .htaccess\nrules as well as the internal kind.\nNote: Internal rules use the $matches[1] method for referencing\npattern matchers.

The $all argument defines the text to be displayed for the\nlink (default being \"All\"). So technically, if I had, for example,\n$optionall = 1 and $all =\"Everything\" I would have the text\n\"Everything\" in the list of categories which would be all the\ncategories.\nExecutive summary: $all is the text to be displayed for the \"show all\ncategories\" option, which in turn is enabled by $optionall =1.\nAddendum: The code for using $optionall and $all was removed in Dec\n2004 and so this is a broken feature/bug - Matt should know why it was\nremoved, and what the plans are.\nhttp://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1072\nhttp://wordpress.org/support/topic/23488\nP.S. : Mike, if you ever need to lookup functions/variables, I\nrecommend Cena Mayo(one of the earliest doc team members)'s wpxrf at\nhttp://www.cenamayo.com/wpxref\n\u003e Also, if someone has a comment or suggestion regarding the Dropdown without\n\u003e Submit Button section in dropdown_cats article I'd appreciate it.

        "body": "Hi.\nRyan Duff wrote:\n\u003e Ask the users, have users add their names, that way its their choice.\n\u003e Delegate somebody who's in irc all the time to keep the page clean of\n\u003e users who aren't often helping in irc or other such mediums. Instead of\n\u003e editing a irc users page, how about creating a support page with a list\n\u003e of people who can be trusted.\nOne question, one proposal.\nQuestion: Isn't it enough to have wpbot knowing about people? If one is\nunsure, ask wpbot about the \"definition\" of the nickname in question. It\nwould be easy to extend the definition with realnames, if people wish so.\nIf not, we come to my proposal. Lorelle asked about \"responsibilities\",\nyou (Ryan) mentioned trustworthyness, both in context with such a \"IRC\nusers list\". So I'd like to suggest to make use of a mechanism provided\nby Freenode: groups.\nThe Freenode IRC network knows so called \"groups\", which are officially\nrepresented in Freenode with one or more channels. This could be a\ncompany, a user group, a \"software project\", ...\nOne of the goodies provided to such groups is a \"project cloak\". A cloak\nis a virtual hostname which appears instead of the real hostname in a\nuser's session. Such a cloak provides protection against attacks from\nscript kiddies (who would need to know the IP address of a user, which\ncan be retrieved by knowing the real hostname of this user), and it\nallows to represent an affiliation between a user and a project.\nExample: I'm usually online in Freenode and OFTC. If you run whois on my\nnickname (otaku42) in OFTC, you'll see something like:\n=== cut ===\n--- [otaku42] (~otaku@dsl-084-058-132-217.arcor-ip.net) : Michael Renzmann\n--- [otaku42] #kernelnewbies @#linuximq #lartc\n--- [otaku42] xenon.oftc.net :Waltham, MA, USA\n--- [otaku42] idle 00:37:38, signon: Mon Jun 27 07:46:49\n--- [otaku42] End of WHOIS list.\n=== cut ===\nThe first line contains my real hostname, which can easily be resolved\nto the corresponding IP address. It's easy for someone to launch attacks\nto this IP - which fortunately doesn't happen often, neither in OFTC nor\nin Freenode.\nIn Freenode you'll see something else:\n=== cut ===\n--- [otaku42] (otaku@otaku42.developer.madwifi) : Michael Renzmann\n--- [otaku42] #wordpress #madwifi-devel #madwifi #freenode #asterisk-dfn\n--- [otaku42] sterling.freenode.net :Hoofddorp, NL, EU\n--- [otaku42] is an identified user\n--- [otaku42] idle 01:01:27, signon: Mon Jun 27 07:46:48\n--- [otaku42] End of WHOIS list.\n=== cut ===\nHere the first line doesn't contain my real hostname, but shows a\nproject cloak. Trying to resolve that cloak to an IP will fail, since\nthe TLD madwifi does not exist. In addition a user can determine my\naffiliation with the project \"Madwifi\": it seems I'm working as\ndeveloper there.\nThe \"TLD\" is fix (\"madwifi\" in the above example), everything else is\nthe choice of the project. For madwifi, we have:\n* \"xyz.user.madwifi\" for people who use our software and are regular\nvisitors in #madwifi\n* \"xyz.support.madwifi\" for people who offer their help in supporting\nother users with their problems\n* \"xyz.developer.madwifi\" for core developers\nWordPress might could also have \"xyz.docs.madwifi\" for members of the\ndocumentation team, or \"xyz.wiki.wordpress\" for the Wiki wizards, and so\non. Again, that's completely the choice of the project.\nAnother goodie is that Freenode reserves channel names for the project.\nWhen the group registers with Freenode, it also specifies the name of\ntheir channel. In case of WordPress this would surely be #wordpress.\nThis automatically reserves all #wordpress-* channels (#wordpress-docs\nand #wordpress-meetup would be automatically protected), so they can't\nbe blocked by a third party.\nNow you might ask what has to be done, and what obligations follow out\nof registering as a group.\nGroup registration establishes an relationship between the group and\nFreenode, by indicating that the group has an official presence on\nFreenode. Groups have to name a contact (one or more persons), which\nacts as connection to Freenode. For example, in case of problems with\none of the group's channels these person(s) will be contacted by\nFreenode staff to clean the problems.\nApart from the above there are no obligations. No need to sponsor\nanything, no need to pay fees, no need to maintain the relationship for\na given time.\nBottom line: registering as group with Freenode and maintaining the\n\"affiliation\" by handing out project cloaks for people might be a good\nway to let users know who is officially affiliated with WordPress. Given\nthat cloaks are not handed out to everyone who pops into the channel\nonce or twice, owners of a wordpress-cloak could be regarded as being\ntrustworthy. A list of currently online group members can easily be\nretrieved (for example: \"/who *.madwifi\") - this would be a list as\ndesired, being maintained on and delivered by IRC instead by a non-IRC\nmedia.\nMore information regarding \"groups\" can be found on the Freenode website:\nhttp://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml\nhttp://freenode.net/primary_groups.shtml\nhttp://freenode.net/about_groups.shtml\nI think \"primary group\" might be the right model for WordPress.\nComments?\nBye, Mike",

Instead of \n\u003e editing a irc users page, how about creating a support page with a list \n\u003e of people who can be trusted.\nYou will have people who will skip the forums and fire off emails to \neveryone on that list because no-one else on the planet has had this \nincredibly obscure \"headers already sent\" error.\nLabels.\nLabelling people as \"the guy who knows rewrite rules\" or \"the guy who \nknows sql\" is okay except:\n- you increase the burden on them as people turn to them directly. Ever \nseen the posts in the forum with \"Podz - help!!\" ? I find those \nextremely embarrasing and it's also as good a signal as any to others \nthat their answer is not wanted.\n- let's say we don't have a \"Rewrite rules\" expert. We've just \nhighlighted that to everyone haven't we ? Is that a good thing ? Did \nthat just hang out the \"Vacancy\" sign ?\n- and giving someone the label - what if they leave ?\nForums.\n \u003e Another suggestion for the forums (when BBPress gets there) is to tag \n \u003e certain users as administrator or moderator either with or instead of \n \u003e \"janitor prime\" and \"support maven\" because new users don't know who \n  \u003e  can be trusted and thats not clear to somebody that podz is a \nmoderator and ryan boren is a dev. (bad cut/paste here)\nAgain you lead to people being targeted. This is not me being against \nsuch a move but I have been bombarded in the past by support requests by \nemail and IM. Not just the odd one or two - many emails per day. That is \na hurdle for the individual to get over.\nIt also implies that certain people cannot be trusted which is not the case.\nThe forum \"staff\" (for want of a better word) has always been kept \nsmall. Right now, excluding Matt and Ryan, it's Carthik, Skippy and \nmyself. To 'promote' someone purely on the fact that they can be \n'trusted' seems fairly weak. The need in the forum for trustworthy \npeople is far outweighed by the need for people who know what's what, \nwhere things are, a good amount of history and a willingness to go in \nthere every day and answer the same questions over and over. That alone \nis good enough for me.\nClearer distinctions ? maybe, but then it's down to the individuals \nconcerned to act consistently and honestly - I have never hidden the \nfact that I can't and don't code but it doesn't stop me finding someone \nwho can.\nAs for a list, you may also have the typical effect that the person at \nthe top gets lots of mail, the one at the bottom does not.\nI would just create the list wherever, not limit it to #irc - because \nthere are perfectly good people who do not use that medium - and have a \nvery clear warning at the top - caveat emptor and suchlike. We also have \nto be crystal clear that ANYONE can add themselves. We can't start any \nsort of exclusivity club.\nP.",

        "body": "I am working on that now. The audience for what you are talking about is \nUsers as differentiated from Webmasters. I love the codex, I love the style, \nand the content is exactly what I need, it's top notich, I appreciate it so \nmuch. \nBut I'd never be able to send my clients there. They will never go beyond \nthe user interface they are presented with. They don't want to go to other \nweb sites or theme web sites, they don't want to understand more than what \nthey need to do on that page. \nSo I'm writing up exactly that, two pages that start with 1) changing your \npassword to something easier to remember... really basic stuff. \nEssentially the people who will come to codex will be the support people, \nnot their users. And in fact you probably want that.\n(I'm new here, but you probably don't want webmasters installing WordPress, \ncharging for it, and sending their clients with their very basic. \"What is \nmy password?\" questions to the free forums. Many people actually do not \nunderstand that the people that they pay to host/install are not paying the \npeople running the forum. I go out of my way to mention that to each client. \nI can provide you with the write-up I hand out on that.)\nAlso the dashboard is very confusing to some of these users. Rather than \nturn that dashboard to my own site, perhaps we could offer a user-level \n'channel' that the installer could set by default one way or the other. \n(Users could change that.) Some examples of user-level articles would be \n\"How do I keep my links fresh?\" \nSo if you set up a\nI-can't-codex.wordpress.org\u003chttp://t-codex.wordpress.org\u003e(that's a\njoke) with that attitude of 'we support the support people.' that\nmight work. A dedicated section to that. \"Resources for Supporting WordPress \nEnd-Users.\"\nAnd on every page, put \"For more information, contact the person who is \nresponsible for supporting your local installation of WordPress.\" And leave \nspace for them to customize it. I have lots of really really basic stuff you \ncould use in that way.\nAm I being silly, or unfriendly to end users you may welcome?\nBy the way, has anyone considered:\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#FDL\na GNU free documentation license for all this.\nA PDF is OK as an alternate format. \nThe questions people have are so basic... My number one problem is that \npeople get upset when they get a request to approve spam for moderation, \nthey don't realize it's not already viewed by their visitors.

I think the confusion lies is when the person realizes that they \ndidn't want to remove their plugin and find that all of their settings \nare now gone.

First, as an advisory to\nthose using WordPress Plugins as a warning to not uninstall the Plugin\nunless they really want to remove all settings and database information.\nThat goes in the Managing Plugins article.\nThe other needs to go into the Plugin development area, at first on how to\nwrite a WordPress Plugin, and possibly elsewhere. The functions and such\nneed to be in the WordPress Functions pages as well. Part of the development\ndocumentation.\nCan you add it or do you want me to? I can add it to the Managing Plugins\narticle, but your development expertise would be better for the other areas.\nThank you.

I said No (as did others) and\n\u003e then promptly got very angry. The reasons why don't matter now. But what\n\u003e it clearly illustrated was that someone wanted to take information\n\u003e freely given by others, chop it about a bit and then sell it to a\n\u003e publisher. They make a nice profit for a few weeks work, and we forever\n\u003e pick up the pieces when people come to the forums saying \"Well the book\n\u003e said.....\"\n\u003e That scenario would seriously annoy me on a number of levels.\n\u003e And it WILL happen.\n\u003e \n\u003e Unless we get in first.\n\u003e WordPress is ours. GPL all you want, but we have laboured on the project\n\u003e in many different ways over a long period of time. If there is to be a\n\u003e book then that must come from our hands, not those of someone out to\n\u003e make a quick buck.\n\u003e \n\u003e We can be honest about the shelflife of the book, we can have\n\u003e \"Official!\" all over it, we can improve it version by version, we will\n\u003e have a tangible product of our work and that of others, we could all\n\u003e even call ourselves \"Authors\" :) - it's it the logical extension of all\n\u003e the work we have done so far isn't it ?\n\u003e It will never be bang up to date but unless the coders take a few years\n\u003e off it never can be.\n\u003e And if we don't start now, when do we ? When can we possibly be ready ?\n\u003e (WordPress - the book. The /ideal/ stocking filler !)\n\u003e \n\u003e I can't speak for Carthik but I doubt very much that given his time and\n\u003e involvement in WordPress that he would say No.\n\u003e \n\u003e I can see there is a \"rights\" issue somewhere, but in some ways we\n\u003e already ride roughshod over that. If I post a solution to the forums and\n\u003e someone copies that to Codex, whose is it ? Submissions to the forum are\n\u003e not GPL. I wouldn't like to even guess where they would fall.\n\u003e My feeling is that if WE publish a book and are open about costs and\n\u003e profits then as others see that there is no nest-feathering going on,\n\u003e that it really is given back to the project then if anything that would\n\u003e have a positive effect.\n\u003e \n\u003e But we'll know nothing until it's published.\n\u003e \n\u003e P.\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e wp-docs mailing list\n\u003e wp-docs@lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs\n\u003e",

The results of the recent surveys to identify active\u003cbr\u003e\ncontributors and elect team reps made it pretty clear that the docs team is=\n\u003cbr\u003e\nin a bit of a slump, organizationally speaking.

It\u003cbr=\n\u003e\ngot me thinking about how we organize contributors, what has worked well\u003cbr=\n\u003e\nelsewhere in the WP ecosystem and in other free software projects, and\u003cbr\u003e\nleads me to this proposal: what if we combined forums and docs into one\u003cbr\u003e\nSupport team?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLooking back at the Codex activity from the past six months or year,\u003cbr\u003e\nchunks of it have been tied to forum mods (like Ipstenu and Andrea_r),\u003cbr\u003e\nother contributor groups (like Chip on the Theme Review Team), and new\u003cbr\u003e\nreleases. Not that how Automattic/WordPress.com organizes itself should\u003cbr\u003e\ndecide anything, but their support team manages forums, email support, and\u003c=\nbr\u003e\ndocs, and it seems to work pretty well. They have a schedule for reviewing\u003c=\nbr\u003e\nexisting documentation so it never gets too far out of date, and the people=\n\u003cbr\u003e\non the front lines with users in the forums and via email can see very\u003cbr\u003e\nclearly where they need to beef up documentation. I\u0026#39;m thinking this cou=\nld\u003cbr\u003e\nwork well for .org, too. Those who are strong writers and just want to\u003cbr\u003e\ncontribute to documentation could still do so, but within a context of what=\n\u003cbr\u003e\nour user support needs are at any given time based on the actual support\u003cbr=\n\u003e\nrequests.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I\u0026#39;m envisioning is less siloing of contributor personnel, with\u003cbr\u003e\none group blog at \u003ca href=3D\"http://make.wordpress.org/support\" target=3D\"_=\nblank\"\u003emake.wordpress.org/support\u003c/a\u003e that uses tags like\u003cbr\u003e\nforums and codex to organize posts, and has pages to help orient new\u003cbr\u003e\ncontributors and get them started.

    "body": "I went through ALL of the template tags and changed each Example 1, Example \n2, etc. to a title that \"describes\" the example. This should better help \nthose looking for specific examples and having to translate the paragraph \nand code to figure out what the example is about.  More user friendly.\nI also left a few \"notes\" in the discussion section on some tags when I had \na question about usage and how that usage was displayed in the examples. \nHopefully Kaf, or whoever will check those and help answer the question and \nimprove the examples of the tags.\nI also started creating a \"Default Usage\" as the first example for some of \nthe more complicated tags.  Going through the list of parameters, it's often \nhard to see what is the default and then remember what it is when you start \nfilling in all the quotes and boolean - include, not include, how to \ninclude - so I created a \"list\" of the default returns on a tag in the \nDefault Usage example to show what would happen if the tag was just used as \n\u003c?php the_tag(); ?\u003e and no parameters set.  I found that incredibly helpful, \nand I hope others will.  If not - delete it.\nWhen possible and appropriate, I added a \"graphic\" representation of the tag \nresults with CSS to help the user better understand the result.\nWhen applicable, I added three examples, growing in complexity, for the \ntemplate tag to help the user better understand the optional uses.  For the \nreally complex tags, we might consider adding more, especially for the \npopular categories, archives, and Pages tags.\nI wanted to add a visual example of the results of the archives tags, but I \ndon't use them and I'm not familiar with what the results would \"look\" like. \nGive me some text examples and I'll go in and add the CSS around them, but I \ndidn't want to assume.\nI cleaned up not only the examples, but on a few of the tags I reworded a \nfew of the descriptions to make it easier to read.  I do hope I didn't mess \nup and change the meaning of any of the tags, or screw up the example so it \nwon't work....so double check, please.\nTags without parameters or examples other than default usage, I checked and \nthen left alone for the most part.\nAlso, when possible I test drove some of the tags to understand their usage \nbetter.  If it borked, it could be because I didn't understand how it worked \nor there's a problem with the tag.  I left a note in the discussion area of \nthese tags.  In particular, I had terrible problems with the link_pages() \ntag which I can reproduce the stylized effect, but the default \"Page 1 2 3\" \nshows up anyway so I have two tags on any post that has mulitple pages. \nThat's not fun.  Since I couldn't find anywhere where the link_pages was \nbeing generated by default (must be built-in somewhere), I left a note to \nfigure how how this works so others won't use the tag and get the same \ndouble paging results.  The Codex article should show how this tag REALLY \nworks in the real world.\nAnd mucho THANKS to the whoevers who put together the template tags menu and \npages.  Wow.  A serious amount of work.  I only hope my humble fussings \nimproved them and complemented the work already there.\nThere's more, but this is enough for one post.\nLorelle",

While I \nwork overtime to make sure the information is as accurate as possible, I \nrely upon other editors to catch my boo boos and fix things before they are \nreleased to the public, especially the technical things.  Which is why I'm \nso specific about asking for the help I need to ensure the document's \naccuracy.\nNow this information, and who knows what else, is out there for the world to \nsee and put into action - AND IT COULD BE VERY WRONG ADVICE.\nThere are a couple of possibilities on handling this that I see, but the \nadmin folks should get everyone's input on this.\n1. Make USER pages unfriendly to search engines with a nofollow or whatever \nin the redirects.\n2. Make sure every user who submits material to the Codex, via their user \npage or a public page, that is in ROUGH DRAFT form, understand that this \ninformation will be in the public view immediately and it must be triple \nchecked for accuracy before posting, making it a \"draft\" not a \"rough \ndraft\".\n3.  Either created by the Codex with some kind of stub thing or manually by \nthe user (with clear instructions), the first words on the user's rough \ndraft page should read:  ROUGH DRAFT - AWAITNG CHECK FOR ACCURACY - \nINFORMATION SUBJECT TO CHANGE - USE AT OWN RISK - or something like that to \nwarn the user that we may not be perfect but we try.  When the article is \nawaiting release, this could be changed to: FINAL DRAFT - AWAITING RELEASE. \nThis would also give the sysops a clue that this article is \"done\" as far as \nsomeone who thinks they know better thinks.\nI might be making an Everest out of a pimple, but I'm worried that, \nespecially on my template tag examples, someone is going to totally bork \ntheir WordPress because of a left out comma or wrong advice.\nSo what do you all think?\nLorelle",

    "subject": "[wp-docs] Wiki Weekend - Editing Help and Comments",
    "body": "Oh, the Codex editing help page and I became best friends and worst enemies \nover the weekend.  I left a note on some \"wishes\" for modifying it on its \ndiscussion page, but some issues came up that are \"bigger\" to discuss since \nthey may apply to all of us working on the documentation pages.\nONE\nAt the bottom of each page is usually a RELATED section of links to topics \nrelated to the article.  Some tags in the Template Tags were not in their \nright category \"stub\" listing.  When it was obvious that this was \"wrong\", I \nchanged it to the right \"related in same category\" by copying the stub from \na related category that had it right.\nBut it got me thinking.  How does a, for instance, template tag get into a \n\"related category\"?  These are generated automatically with a {{tag}}.  And \nnot all pages have these, though most do.\nI'd love to see \"related\" items on the Main Page sub pages to help people \nfind related informatoin about the topics at hand.  Can we add it there?  Is \nthis something the sysop does or can anyone editing do that?  I think that's \na wonderful feature and I'd love to see it on all the pages, when possible.\n----------\nTWO\nI had a terrible time \"faking\" links in the visual examples of some of the \ntags and in the Lessons articles I'm working on.\nI decided to create a link to the page I was on, so if I was on \nTemplate_Tags/wp_list_pages then my intra-article faked link would be \nsomething like\n[[Template_Tags/wp_list_pages#Example_1|link text here]]\nInstead, it turned the link \"bold\" without a link reference.  I fought with \nthis for hours until I figured out that in the Codex, you can't link to the \npage you are on.  It kills the link.  So I had to find another way of \ncreating an example fake link in order for people to \"see\" the visual \nresults of the tag's usage.\nCarthik finally helped me by suggesting that I use [[#|link title]] to cause \na non-action link to the same page.  Didn't work.  The # takes the user to \nthe Main Page of the Codex. That's too far a jump for a user to face and \ntime wasting to hit the back button.\nSince the template tags I was working on all had ==Examples== in the example \nsection title, I ended up using [[#Examples|link title]] to cause the user \nwho might click on the link example to link to the Examples section - where \nthey are already viewing anyway, so it's a minor jump in the page.  Or I \nwould use the sub-section title like ===Excluding Categories=== as \n[[#Excluding_Categories|link title]] to keep the \"jump\" close by.\nBy removing the actual page title in the link, the link would \"work\".\nWe need to add this information (or improve my process) to the Editing Help \narticle for intra-article links.\n----------------\nTHREE\nWhen using a DIV to stylize an example, and there is a list inside of the \nexample in the Codex, I can't just put\n\u003cdiv style=\"blah\"\u003e* Item One\n * Item Two\n* Item Three....\u003c/div\u003e\nThe list then looks like this (+=proper bullet and *=asterick symbol - no \nbullet):\n* Item One\n+ Item Two\n+ Item Three....\nIn other words, in order to SEE the proper bullet and not an asterick, I \nhave to order the list with a line break after the DIV:\n\u003cdiv style=\"blah\"\u003e\n* Item One\n* Item Two\n* Item Three....\u003c/div\u003e\nAnd then it looks right.\n+ Item One\n+ Item Two\n+ Item Three....\nIs this a bug or a \"supposed to work this way\" in the codex?\nIf you \"edit\" (screw it up and you'll be shot!) my article \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Stepping_Into_Template_Tags in the \nsections where I show off what a category list would be, simply delete the \nline break after a div so it looks like the first example, and then preview, \nyou will see the first line item turn into an asterick...at least I hope you \nwill.  If not...well, this is just another visit to an auto mechanic and you \ncan forget I brought it up.\n----------------------\nFOUR\nThis is just a humble opinion style issue, but I'd really like to see a \nlittle more \"space\" between the last paragraph of the section above and the \nsub-section title.  In other words, add some padding or a margin to the \nsection titles to give them a little more breathing room.  Sometimes it \nfeels like they are sitting on top of each other and crowded.  I usually put \na double space between the section ending paragraph and the next section \ntitle.  If I'm using a PRE or code box before the section title, it sits \nright on top of the section title.\nI'd also like to see a tad more space between OL and UL lists.  Not a \ncentimeter or two, but a millimeter or three little bit more space.  If you \nadd an extra line space in an OL list, your list numbers are\n1. list text\n1. list text\n1. list text\nJust a little thing that has annoyed me since day one.  I like SPACE around \nmy writing and examples and trying to force them within the Codex has \nunpleasant effects sometimes.\n-------------------\nFIVE\nNo five, but give me a chance.  I'm still processing the stuff I did over \nthe weekend....hee hee....got to work on that evil laugh in text.\nLorelle",

A lot of work has gone into expanding the Codex by many volunteers \nand new volunteers are coming in all the time. Volunteers are watching \nthe Recent Changes pages 24 hours a day, monitoring the Codex for spam \nand link vandals, usually catching the vandals within minutes of the \nattack. Thanks to all!\nThe connection between the Forum and the Codex is now very strong, \ncreating a solid base of information and resources. With the release of \nthe Jalenack's plugin (with great help from Ringmaster)  \nhttp://blog.jalenack.com/archives/codex-search-plugin/ which allows the \naddition of a search bar to the WordPress admin panels for searching the \nCodex and Forum while using WordPress, users can get access to the \ninformation they need to solve their problems and help them build and \nmaintain their WordPress site easier. We need to promote the plugin to \nhelp users \"Search First\". If you have been monitoring the Forum, you \nmay have noticed that the redundant simple questions are declining and \nthe more intermediate and advanced questions are rising. So they are \nsearching first, which is great.\nWith the development of the Support Forum volunteer mailing list \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Support_Forum_Volunteers, volunteers will be \nable to work together and learn from each other about how to better \nprovide ongoing support. Many of us also help on the forum, so we can \nhelp volunteers learn more about the documentation available and learn \nfrom them about what documentation is needed.\nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference is slowly being expanded \nand worked on to include all the functions in the core programming, \nsimilar to Template Tags. Help is needed to add more subpages, \nidentifying functions and their features.\nKeywords are slowly being added to the \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes/Theme_List so if you are a theme \nauthor or you would like to volunteer to add keywords to various themes, \nplease pitch in.  A lot of theme authors list their themes and then \ndon't return for months, if ever, so all help is appreciated to get \nkeyword descriptions on these themes.\nWe are still having problems with new images displaying right on the \nCodex, so hopefully that will be fixed soon, now that the database has \nbeen moved to the new server.\nThere are many tasks on the task list that need doing, so please check \nto see if there is something you can do. \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks If you signed up for a task and \nare now unable to follow through on it, please remove your name so \nsomeone else can take it on. If you see holes in the documentation that \nare not listed on the Task List, please add them in their appropriate \ncategory so we can encourage \"filling of holes\".\nIf you have an article on your user page, you will be contacted in the \nnext few weeks with a request to ready the article for moving out into \nthe main documentation. If you are unable to complete the article, \nplease let us know so we can have others pitch in to finish it.\nThe http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:State_of_Codex lists administrative \nissues and tasks that need to be discussed and dealt with.  Some of \nthese have been waiting for a decision or action. While no decision has \nbeen officially made, it appears that the issue of dealing with version \n1.5 and 1.6 will include the use of the version in the title and the use \nof a template banner that states this applies to which version where \nnecessary. Other than user levels and administration panels, and updates \nand inclusion of new template tags and functions, very little change to \nthe \"how to\" documentation is expected to occur.\nWork is underway to \"combine\" the Codex and WordPress site so that when \na user clicks on \"DOCS\" they will be taken to the Codex. \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/User:RobLa/AuthPress_for_MediaWiki is part of \nthe process.  Basically, bbpress and mediawiki will be \"intercombined\". \nUser registration information will be shared between the two so your \nuser name and password will work on both systems. There are some bugs \nand details that still need to be worked out. The \"look\" of the Codex \nwill take on the look of the Forum, with modifications on both ends. In \ngeneral, the merger and changes will \"spruce the place up\".\nThanks to everyone for all your hard work!",

It would be nice for consistency of the look.\nAnd another question: if codex is going to be rolled out to localized\nsites in the future, can we have (for example) ja.codex.wordpress.org\ndomain assigned to our sourceforge.jp site?\nBoth are not critical for launching and maintaining our documentation\nsite, but I appreciate it if you could share any information related\nto this topic.\nThank you,\nNaoko McCracken\nhttp://detlog.org/ | http://nao-net.com/",

        "subject": "[wp-docs] CSS Styles in the Codex",
        "body": "Thanks Lorelle. I have some notes that I've put together regarding the \nstyling. They are as follows:\n    * A rule in the Codex's CSS prevents DIVs from being styled. I\n      worked around this by using SPANs with a display of block. It\n      would be better if DIVs could actually be styled. As it is, there\n      are DIVs, such as the container for drafts, that are styled but\n      don't show the styling currently.\n    * It would be nice if a class existed that would apply the PRE\n      styling to other elements (such as DIVs). This would make it very\n      easy to create code blocks that support wrapping. It would also\n      ensure that any updates to PRE styling would affect blocks that\n      are styled to look like PRE.\n    * The CSS rules don't have any padding for table elements. The only\n      way to work around this (due to not being able to define CSS rules\n      other than via individual style declarations) is by either using\n      cellspacing and cellpadding (not desirable) or adding style\n      information to every TH and TD element (also not desirable).\n      Adding padding in the CSS for all tables would make overriding\n      difficult, so I would like to request a class that can be used to\n      apply padding to all th and td elements without using styles for each.\n    * Lack of styling for DD and DT elements. I solved this by manually\n      applying style information to each element. The way that DD and DT\n      elements are styled in the PHP documentation is very nice. Similar\n      to my request with tables, I'd like to be able to use a class on\n      the DL element to apply this type of styling to the DD and DT\n      elements.\n    * The \u003c/dd\u003e and \u003c/dt\u003e elements are not supported, thus breaking\n      standards. If I include the closing DD and DT tags, they are\n      parsed as text and not as tags.\n    * The %%% directive makes very nicely-colored PHP code output, but\n      it has limitations.\n          o To get the output to be have syntax highlighting, it needs\n            to be wrapped in \u003c?php ?\u003e tags. This adds unnecessary lines\n            since the presence of these tags can be assumed in most\n            instances. It would be nice if there could be an option to\n            force highlighting without the use of the tags.\n          o The output is not contained in a box like as the CSS styles\n            the PRE. This type of container is helpful as it clearly\n            sets the code apart from the rest of the documentation. I\n            manually applied this look using the styled SPAN that I used\n            for the function structure.\nYou can see examples of how I worked around all these issues at my \nwp_cache_add draft \n\u003chttp://codex.wordpress.org/User:Chrisbliss18/wp_cache_add\u003e. This will \ngive you a good idea of how much styling I had to apply to get a \nconsistent look.\nThese are just notes and ideas. By no means, do they have to be \nimplemented. However, I would see it as a very nice New Year's gift if \nsome were. :)\nChris Jean\nhttp://gaarai.com/\nhttp://wp-roadmap.com/\nLorelle VanFossen wrote:\n\u003e I've been told by Matt Thomas that he and another new designer they \n\u003e just hired will be fixing the design style problems with the Codex. \n\u003e I've sent them a whole list of things that need fixing, but if there \n\u003e is anything really annoying you, please post it here in this thread so \n\u003e we don't miss anything.\n\u003e\n\u003e A key thing I'm asking to get changed is moving the third column back \n\u003e over to the left so we have more room when editing.

The\nidea is for articles which share what may be common knowledge and\nresources about techniques and essential skills that the beginning\nWordPress users may not be aware of. I personally think that Lessons\nwill teach folks how to fish, instead of feeding them fish, one at a\ntime.\nIf no one has any objections or suggestions, the section may be\ncreated by Thursday April 7th (by me, Lorelle, or anyone else so\ninclined).\nThank you,\nCarthik.\nOn Apr 4, 2005 5:34 PM, lorelle@cameraontheroad.com\n\u003clorelle@cameraontheroad.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e Yami McMoots has written a great article on how to create an Archive index,\n\u003e and the steps can apply to a variety of different \"specialty\" pages in\n\u003e WordPress.

Although his blog post does a wonderful job of explaining the new capabilities, the WordPress Codex is devoid of any documentation ? see http://codex.wordpress.org/oEmbed .\nI think we should take some action to document this new feature, since it IS a really big improvement over the previous media features in the core.

If there are others out there who are running 2.9-rare from trunk like I am, I think it would be great if we could comb through the information and put some of it on the Codex.\nJust putting the idea out there.\nRegards,\nFrederick Ding (http://www.frederickding.com/)",

    "body": "I don't have a lot of time to spare for this message, so forgive me if \nI'm terse.\n From comments I've seen on my blog an elsewhere, there is a segment of \ncurrent users out there who are put off by the new admin interface in \none way or another. For example:\n\"I just checked out the demo site, and I am sorry to say that I don't \nlike it, why you may ask? Headaches! I have like 9 blogs to maintain, \nand due to being familiar with the old version, I can't see myself \nswitching. What happens to to 40+ plugins I now use, will most of them \nbe unusable? I never did find the options page, maybe I gave up to soon. \nJust please tell me this won't be a mandatory upgrade!\"\nWhile your or I might think that it's an extreme or frivolous response \nto not upgrade just because the interface has changed, it's obviously \nimportant to this person. Obviously we aren't going to change the admin \nGUI back to the old style, so what do we do?\nI suggest the creation of a \"What's new in WordPress 2.5\" document, to \nbe present on the main website and/or Codex, and included prominently in \nthe distribution itself, and presented (at least as a prominent link) at \nthe end of the upgrade process. This document should have twenty-seven \neight-by-ten color glossy screenshots of the Admin GUI, with circles and \narrows, and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what it \nis[1]. In other words, a nice guide for upgrading users (maybe for new \nusers, too?) which says things like, \"If you're looking for the old \n'Options' menu, it's now called 'Settings', and it's located in the \nupper-right: [img]\".\nEven it if it doesn't make it into the release distribution, it would \nstill be a good article, which I'm sure would get plenty of prominent \nlinkage, if done well. If I had time to create such a document myself, I \nwould. But I don't. And furthermore, I suck at that particular sort of \ndocumentation, so it would probably be better for somebody else to do it \nanyhow. So consider this a call for volunteers. Any takers?\n[1] Sorry.

        "body": "I'm working on such a document, but it won't go live before the release.\nThe issue you bring up is a serious one. It's also one that WordPress\nendures every time there is a major upgrade. Changes bring out the worst in\nmany. I know that many are hearing loudly the few who don't like it and\nignoring the many who do like it but are silent. Such is how it goes.\nWhat truly makes a difference is not a document in the Codex but everyone\njumping on the enthusiasm, \"I published first pics\" band wagon, telling the\nworld about how easy, or difficult, the transition will be. The more\nbloggers spreading the word about how to use it, the easier the transition\nfor everyone as their feed readers are filling with news and information and\nhow tos by everyone.\nRight now, things are jumping in the design and I don't think anyone has\ntime to change screen shots every few hours or days, so if someone wants to\njump on this now, go ahead, but update the images when they change, please,\nin order to ensure they match reality on the fast changing ground of\nWordPress 2.5.\nThe rest of you, try out the beta release and get your screenshots up and\nlet the world know how to use it via your blogs. Grassroots is what makes\nWordPress documentation even stronger. :D\nThanks. And expect a lot of changes in the Codex to accommodate the new\ninterface over the next couple of months. There are a LOT of changes to\nmake.\nLorelle\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/attachments/20080325/8e5aec80/attachment.htm",

If you \nfind one, then please let the docs team know so we can fix it right away \nso all the titles are consistent.\nNow, this is where it gets confusing.\nIf you are creating a link within the Codex to another page in the \nCodex, you must use the EXACT upper and lower case structure of the \noriginal file.  So [[the Loop in Action]] won't work.  Neither will \n[[the loop in action]]. It has to be [[The Loop in Action]], usually \nwithout the underlines though that will work, too, it's just ugly.  \nWe've made some redirects for things like The_Loop, the_loop, and \nThe_loop to accommodate this.\n From outside of the Codex, any incoming link will work such as \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/The_loop_in_Action.  Case doesn't matter, it \nwill work.\nNow, from the forum....we need to do some tests to see what works. If it \nonly uses the Mediawiki constraints for links within the Codex to \nanother Codex page, then we are stuck with the exact capitalization.  If \nit works as though it is an external link, then it doesn't matter.  So \nwhich is it?  Let's do some tests.\nMiklb, do you want to do some tests on this? You can either test it in \npractice, or on the thread that announced the links to the Codex and say \n\"this is a test of the links\" and then post it so we can see the \nresults.  When we have the results and the Codex is fixed and able to be \nedited (hopefully today or tomorrow), then we can write up a page that \nhelps volunteers and others understand how this really should work.\nThanks for bringing it to our attention.\nLorelle",

I went to great \nlengths to allow non-technical users to add their flikr, and skype, stats, \ncontact form, and such without making the theme invalid or inaccessible. \nSame with styles and all sorts of stuff. The functionality of this theme is \npretty deep. But none of it affects the operability or update-ability of WP \nitself. My theme adds to WP, but doesn't interfere or take away from it. \nUsing the links template, I even added a facility for someone to create a \nfull-fledged dynamic site map for added accessibility.\nAs far as I know the only place I strayed from the recommendations is that I \nused a lot of shorthand PHP (I didn't see that new recommendation until it \nwas too late). I wouldn't suspect my theme would be removed from the Codex \nfor *that* would it?\nI want to replace the Codex entry, but obviously won't until I can ensure \nit's not going to be removed and I'm not breaking any rules. I spilled a lot \nof blood and sweat making this one so I'd hate to see it dismissed \nsummararily.\nCan someone tell me why it was removed and may I put it back.\nHere's is the forum post announcing the theme (a respondent suggest I ask \nhere): http://wordpress.org/support/topic/74190\nAnd here is the theme demo (the entire site is devoted to theme support):\nhttp://green-beast.com/seabeast/\nIn advance, thanks.\nSincerely,\nMike Cherim\nhttp://green-beast.com/\nhttp://accessites.org/\nhttp://graybit.com/",

    "body": "I've started cleaning up the WordPress Codex Table of Contents in \npreparation for changing their structure. This involves removing the \n\"NEW\" on old articles and just making sure everything is included. It's \na very tedious process, so this is slow going. Once I have figured out \nwhat is missing (and please point out any articles not listed in the TOC \npages in case I miss them) and added them to the appropriate place, then \nI'll have a better offering of how to structure the TOC better. I'll be \nsending out a list of the order and such for your recommendation before \nI do anything. Stay tuned for that.\nI also wanted to clear up some confusion that the WordPress Lessons \nsection may have for you.\nWordPress Lessons is a separate but inclusive part of the WordPress \nCodex. I think of the WordPress Codex divided up into two parts. There \nis the technical user manual for all of the specific tech how to and \nexplanations. This includes beginning, get started, and all the stuff to \nthe highest techie levels.\nThe other part is a group of tutorials called WordPress Lessons. The \nLessons rely heavily upon the technical manual articles but offer a \nunique writing style. Instead of 1, 2, 3 tech talk, these are the \ntutorial guides which slowly lead a new user through a process \nstep-by-step. In presenting these a few years ago, I described them as \nwritten so the reader feels like a WordPress support volunteer is \nsitting by their side saying \"now do this, now that, that's good, that's \nright, you're on the right- oh, no, go back, now fix this - that's \nbetter\" tone of voice. Not patronizing but helpful and guiding.\nThe WordPress Lessons were never intended to become replacements for the \ntechnical manual information. Due to the lack of articles on some of \nthese subjects, WordPress Lessons are now filtered into the technical \nside of the Codex.\nI would like to see the holes in the technical documentation on some of \nthese subjects get more technical articles filling them. There is a list \non the http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks Task List which may help \nif you are interested in writing these technical articles.\nIn starting my \"cleaning\" process on the TOC, I found two whole sections \nof WordPress Lesson links removed with a link to two other table of \ncontents pages. It should be the other way around. We need to keep \nWordPress Lessons with Lessons so people will have one place featuring \nthese guides and tutorials, so please keep them with the Lessons and \nrefer to them from the other Tables of Contents in the future.  If a \ntechnical article on the subject is needed, do it or add it to the to do \ntask list, please.\nI'd love to have no repetition to the same links from multiple TOC \npages. But sometimes that can't be helped. Let's use this as a clue to a \n\"technical article needed here\". ;-)\nThanks,\nLorelle",

    "body": "I've been working this week on cleaning up and editing documentation \nfor theme, plugin, and core WordPress developers (it's coming along). \nAlso updating for version 2.1.\nWhat I've come across is that there are quite a few Codex pages that \nare overlapping lists of articles. For instance, the following pages \ncontain lists of resources related to Theme development, and have no \nactual content:\n* http://codex.wordpress.org/Templates (fairly comprehensive)\n* http://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_Design_and_Layout (some sections)\n* http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons (two sections are \nrelated to themes and templates)\n* http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation (one section on \nThemes)\n* http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page (of course, the main page also \nduplicates several sections of the above)\nI'm concerned because each of these lists has different articles, and \nthere is not one sole source to look at for a comprehensive list. \nAlso, some of the lists are not annotated, so you don't really know \nwhat you will find when you click on the link (it could just lead you \nto another page of links, or an article that is aimed at the wrong \naudience). Not to mention that many content-rich articles also have \nlinks to a few resources for further reading, where they could just \npoint the user back to the comprehensive, organized, annotated list of \nresources.\nSo, can some of these be consolidated? For instance, maybe Blog Design \nand Layout could be the main place for design/layout articles, and \nTemplates (instead of having any layout sections) could simply point \nto that page. Obviously, any articles linked to from the wordpress.org \nhome page, or from the codex.wordpress.org sidebar, need to remain!\nThoughts? Is it OK if I go ahead and consolidate the developer-facing \ndocumentation in that way? (I'll stay away from the Main Page for now).\n     --Jennifer",

There was some discussion on \nthis list at the start of December (before you joined?).  Matt replied \nto my message on the topic by saying \"it'd be nice if the links on the \nfront page of wordpress.org and more links on the Codex homepage took \nyou directly to content.\"  If Matt wants those pages cleaned up, I'd \nguess that he (and others) would agree with fixing more-minor pages. \nBut, as I read in a discussion somewhere else (I've lost track of \nwhere), some people do like this system of links-to-links.\nI'm new to WordPress, so my advice could be shortsighted.  Still, I'll \ntry. ;-)  Instead of replacing the pages, you might put revised page(s) \nin a temporary location so people can have a look.  If they look good, \nyou could install them in the most likely location -- and revise the \nobsolete pages of links to say \"this page has moved to NEW-LOCATION\". \n(I can't think of a way to maintain compatibility with the old system of \nmultiple overlapping pages.

How do I find a theme that I like?  The number of them is\noverwhelming.  When I go to: http://themes.wordpress.net/\nI see black rectangles where the screenshots should be.  Am I doing\nsomething wrong?\n2. The official wordpress.org website has lessons on it but there are\ndozens of tiny lessons.  Is there anyplace to download a large WP\ntutorial/document as a PDF, print it out and work with?\nThanks a lot!\n--------------\nMy comments:\n1) The themes at themes.wordpress.net need some love - black\nrectangles are not really helpful. :) I noticed this earlier, but I\nthought it is something transient and might get fixed soon.\n2) We do need a book-ish thingy that we can point users at that they\ncan download. This might just be the single most important missing\nlink in the documentation.\nI will reply to the user myself for now - he seems to have found my\ncomment on my own userpage inviting users to contact me for help if\nthe codex fails them, which brings us to point 3:\n3) We need to have a way to let codex's users contact a person, or a\nteam(the wp-docs list, the forums?) if the codex fails to answer their\nquestion/fulfil their need.

Now that the Codex is back working, they are \nstarting to slowly add to the information again.\nThe idea is to set each language in it's own section with a layout that \nfollows this kind of form:\nSupport:\nDownloads:\nThemes:\nPlugins:\nAnd then with more \"title links\" as needed, creating a uniform link. \nI think it is brilliant to add SOLID international support forums at the \nbottom or sidebar of wordpress.org. By solid, I mean a site that has \nactivity and some history, as some of these have come and gone rather \nquickly. At the least, a link to the \"WordPress in Your Language\" would \nbe the next best thing.  Creating a separate page for support is exactly \nwhat was fixed when Moshu and others worked for a couple of months \nreally hard to totally redo these pages.

The last thing we need \nis to segregate the information on the Codex again.\nWe get a lot of people on the forum who struggle to make their question \nmake sense in English, and sometimes they get ignored because the \nquestion and English is so hard to understand. Anyway we can help direct \nthese people to help in their language is welcome.\nThe Codex has a list in the footer of other Codex-like support, but I \nthink it is lost on the page, which is why we worked so hard to get the \n\"WordPress in Your Language\" updated and into the main table of contents.\nLorelle",

However, it seems to me that you \nwere right in this case. But, maybe \"unprofessional\" is the wrong label to \nuse for this. I think that the measure of a contribution to the Codex \nshould not be professionalism, but whether it helps to build useful \ndiscussion or documentation for WordPress. Looking at his comment, I don't \nsee that \"I don't personally want to work on WordPress until Matt is gone\" \nis a useful bit of documentation. I don't know anything about it, but I \nsuppose it may be relevant discussion to ask \"Is Matt's value to WordPress \nmore critical than the loss of a few contributors irritated about an error \nhe might have made\"? In fact, I think a few people would be happy to \nrespond to that very clearly! And, that seems more relevant to discussion, \nnot documentation, so it could be directed to the forums instead.\nRemember that people who contribute negative things like this DO care about \nWordPress. If they didn't care, they would make the effort, I think. In my \nopinion, being welcoming to the WordPress community requires giving people \nlike this a gentle and respectful nudge in the right direction:\n\"Your recent comment on the WordPress Codex was removed, because it did not \nseem to contribute to documenting WordPress, the goal of the Codex. Your \ncomment may have been appropriate for discussion on the WordPress Forum, \nbut you should be sure to provide sufficient background information and a \nclear goal or problem before addressing this to the Forum, since the \nForum's goal is to build constructive discussion and support for the \nWordPress community. As a matter of policy to prevent abusive behavior on \nthe Codex, users with removed comments are often banned from further \ncomments for 10 days. Your posting access will resume in 10 days and we'll \nhope to see your contributions to WordPress documentation after that time. \nThanks sincerely.\"\nIt's wordy, isn't it? But, nearly as easy to cut and paste as to type \n\"unprofessional comments\" and nudges them constructively and respectfully \nin the right direction. I think less terse and more welcoming dialog with \npotential contributors is an important goal.\nTo me, it looks like you were totally right on to remove the comment and \nyour contribution in dealing with negative people like this should be truly \nappreciated. I just wanted to offer a suggestion for defusing this sort of \nsituation and (perhaps) bringing some of this type of contribution around \nto be positive contributions to WordPress.\nThanks,\n-Michael (Moore)\n michael@followingedge.com",

        "body": "There's only so much you can do to make certain things \"simple enough\".\nMy concern with your changes was how MUCH data we had up there. People don't read.  They just don't, not for WordPress, and not for their jobs (if I go postal, it will probably be over people telling me that they didn't read the documentation because at 6 short sentences, it was too long).  Even right now, we do have too much going on.\nSo in my eyes, the question we need to answer is: Why do people go to the FRONT page of the codex?\nI would say it's because they've heard about WP and they either want to see what sort of documentation there is at all before installing, or they have their first question about it.  So the first section should be how to install, how to add themes/plugins, how to get help.\nNext we have the 'how do I use this?' set.  So we need a section on how to make posts and pages and links.  Also how to use widgets in themes.  In fact, something for a basic \"this is how a theme works, this is how you can edit it.\" WITHOUT touching any code.\nFinally you have the creationists (not those, the ones who wanna write stuff).\nPeople who make plugins and themes already know how to Google.  People who want to learn to do that, though, should have a quick \"this is how you make A theme. This is a child theme.\" and a plugin one.\nBut after that, we're getting into heavy lifting, and there's really not a perfect way to avoid learning code and how to read technical docs to learn things. We shouldn't lower the bar, but we should build some stepladders so they can climb up and join us :)\nOn Aug 26, 2011, at 1:14 PM, Spencer Hill \u003cspencerhill at theportlandco.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e Hey everyone.

Also books provide a great source of\nstructured handouts for training (that's what I do for cash).\nI'm sure that there is a space for this kind of thing on the\nwordpress.org without drawing attention from the essential stuff already\nthere - I wonder if it is a separate space from the codex or if it can\nbe well integrated.\nIt's great that learn.wordpress.com can be gpl-ed for the codex -\nthere's some great stuff there.\nWe also use GPL at flossmanuals for the docs there to, so anything that\ngets written there can be synched into the hopefully growing pages for\nbeginners / intermediates to create that ladder.\nThe book jog is plodding on - there's a lot of content now - here's\ntoday's snap shot.\nhttp://objavi.booki.cc/books/wordpress-en-2011.08.27-16.24.09.pdf\nPlease do feel free to register and get editing.

I was wondering if anyone \nwanted to look over the page and give suggestions on possible \ncorrections or make corrections to finished portions.\nThe specific purpose of the guide is to inform the developer how to best \ngo about testing the performance and walk the developer through the \nsteps to install two different PHP extensions in order to do so.\nThe Xdebug section is finished, the MySQLnd section is not. The MySQLnd \nsection will be difficult, but it is built for PHP 5.3. PHP 5.3 hasn't \nbeen released, the MySQLnd driver/library is incomplete and can be \nconsidered unstable (alpha). It is also only (currently) for the mysqli \nextension, which not supported by WordPress. PDO support is being added, \nbut that is even more unsupported by WordPress and unstable.\nThe reason to discuss mysqlnd driver/library, is that it has useful \nstatistical data for MySQL. Sure you can use the MySQL utilities to get \nthe same information, but the goal is to discuss this all within the \ncontext of WordPress and PHP. It would make better sense to discuss how \nto get the statistical data to better track SQL query performance and \noverhead. However, that is outside the scope of my knowledge. I do know \nPHP and so that is what I'm going to discuss in the article.\nI think I will create a note for it for future inclusion, when I do more \nresearch on the subject. I do mention WinCacheGrind for Xdebug profiling.\nAlso, if you don't mind, I'll want to maintain the page for now. I'm \nprobably going to modify it during the Summer and will no longer \nmaintain the guide afterwards. That is if PHP 5.3 is released. There are \nsome notes in the guide about PHP 5.3 in the future tense and will need \nto be changed to past/present tense after the PHP 5.3 release.\n[1] http://codex.wordpress.org/Testing_WordPress_Performance",

    "body": "I knew there were a couple of WordPress Groups out there, but not over 100 \ndifferent groups around the world. Wow.  Carthik has authorized me to write \na synopsis about these groups for the Codex, and I think that after it is \nwritten, those with the \"power\" to put things on blogs which end up spread \nall over the place, should think about promoting these groups.  They are a \npowerful tool that WordPress needs.\nSo, to write the little article about the groups, I need information about \nthe groups.  Anyone belong to one?  Familiar with one?  Attended a meeting? \nI need to know some stuff:\n1. When was the first one formed, why, and where.\n2. Have there been any articles or stories written about these groups?\n3. How are the international groups doing?\n4. Is there thought of an international annual or bi annual meetings of \nthese different groups?\n5. Other than discussion and WordPress projects and support, are there any \nbenefits to joining these groups?\n6. Which is the oldest?  Which has the most active members? Other highlights \nabout these groups?\n7. Other than using meetup.com to stay in touch, how else to they stay in \ntouch with members?\n8. Do they have guest speakers or just social time when they get together?\nIf you are a member or know of any group members, could you ask them to \nemail me at lorelle at cameraontheroad.com and let me know about their group \nfor the article.  Any little unique or fun tidbit that would make this a \nlittle more interesting would help.\nThanks,\nLorelle",

Also, I'm not clear how WordPress currently prevents\n\u003e\u003e building accessible sites for those aiming to create them. Can you explain\n\u003e\u003e that a bit, or point me towards more information?\n\u003e\n\u003e WordPress itself would come under the general heading of \"CMS/Software\n\u003e Requirements\" within the anti-discrimination laws of any given country.\n\u003e Certainly in the UK, it would fall under the Disability Discrimination\n\u003e Act if it did not make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled\n\u003e users are not unfairly disadvantaged when it came to using the software.\n\u003e Many other countries in Europe have similar - if not more stringent -\n\u003e legal requirements. I'd imagine ADA would apply in the US.\n\u003e\n\u003e Legality aside, there are the ethical responsibilities to ensure that\n\u003e disabled users can create sites as easily as possible. And there are\n\u003e quite a few disabled users who use WordPress as their CMS of choice -\n\u003e primarily because it already offers a reasonable level of accessibility.\n\u003e But that doesn't mean it can't be improved. We also need to teach people\n\u003e how to get the best of the features that it offers. :-)\n\u003e\n\u003e AFAIIA, Section 508 only applies to the public-facing side of (federal?)\n\u003e sites. So the onus is really on the site owner but, again, I think we\n\u003e have an ethical duty to help people create the most accessible sites\n\u003e that they can.\n\u003e\n\u003e HTH\n\u003e\n\u003e esmi\n\u003e --\n\u003e http://quirm.net\n\u003e http://blackwidows.co.uk\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e ------------------------------\n\u003e\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e wp-docs mailing list\n\u003e wp-docs at lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e End of wp-docs Digest, Vol 85, Issue 9\n\u003e **************************************\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e wp-docs mailing list\n\u003e wp-docs at lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs",

WordPress 2.7 will be on WordPress.com in a few hours,\nand we, the documentation team, need to get our acts together.\nIn general, the Codex will not be supporting old versions of WordPress since\nmost have known security vulnerabilities and we are encouraging upgrading to\nthe latest version accordingly. This doesn't mean \"old\" articles will be\nobsolete and deleted. They are to be marked as follows:\n1. For pages covering known versions, add this to the top with the correct\nversion number.\n   {{Oldpage|2.6}} or whatever the version number is.\n2. For sections covering older versions, you can add the same thing in the\nsection, under the section title.\n3. For pages covering older versions, but not specific older versions, add\nthis to the top of the page.\n   {{Oldversion}}\nI recommend you add {{Oldversion}} when in doubt.\nHere is a to do list to help volunteers get started. It would be nice to let\nus know if you will take on a specific set of documents, such as everything\nwithin the installation, design, or whatever sections. I'll be working with\nJane on adding the new screencasts to the WordPress Lessons and other key\npages within the Codex.\n1. See http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/27-gets-here-in-two-days/ for\nchanges in how panels are to be referenced. In the past, we've pointed to\nmenu items such as Write \u003e Post and the new version is Posts: Add New. All\nreferences need to be updated accordingly.\n2. Jane is working on http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels, one\nof the most linked to pages on the Codex. When the updates are finished\nwhich match the new version, let's ensure that we follow that lead with all\nof our guides and references for naming things.\n3. If you are currently using the Beta RC, please go through the\nAdministration Pages and find every link to a help file on the Codex and\nensure that these documents are up-to-date and accurate, as well as reflect\nthe changes in WordPress. We will need many eyes to review these, as well as\nfind them, to ensure they are ready.\n4. I will be working on the new table of contents and posting it hopefully\nnext week. I've been waiting for new changes in the naming structure and\ninterface before jumping too fast. I'll be announcing the demo pages here\nand seeking input. We're aiming to keep the table of contents pages very\nsimple and easy to find things.\n5. I've asked Matt Thomas several times to fix the CSS in the Codex,\nespecially restoring image floats and DIV styles for demo examples, as we\nhave no access. Hopefully, he will implement those improvements soon to make\nit easier to read and work with the Codex, as well as edit and contribute.\nThanks to everyone for pitching in, and I'll try to get the WP-Docs IRC\nchannel open next week for immediate input and response as we work on the\nCodex. Hope to see you there!\nLorelle\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/attachments/20081204/7c9e524e/attachment.htm",

    "subject": "[wp-docs] Structure of documentation",
    "body": "Hi everybody,\nI'm new on this list, but has something I want to share with you.\nI'm using Wordpress for about three years now, but decided last few\nweeks to modify my weblog in various ways. I wrote some plugins and\nthemes in the past, but now I had to write some more advanced plugins\nand a completely new theme. Because I wanted to do this 'the right\nway', I decided to read the documentation on these subjects carefully.\nI have to say that the documentation on Wordpress is very complete and\ncovers almost everything, which (I think) is a very good thing.\nHowever, I think there is a rather big problem with the Wordpress\ndocumentation, and that is its structure. It is very hard to find the\nthing you're looking for. Especially when writing plugins I notice\nthis problem.\nI have thought about this problem, and what's the cause of it. I think\nthere are several problems causing this rather chaotic structure.\n1) Tutorials, howto's and reference documentation seems to be mixed\ntogheter. While tutorials and howto's can be useful in some cases,\nthey are distractive when you're looking for one particular function\nor method.\n2) The function reference (which is not easy to find, I only noticed\nit after a while) is not structured very well. Currently, the\nfunctions, options, classes are sorted by a (seemingly) random\ncategorization, which is not very obvious to understand (in my\nopinion). For example, it took me some time to discover that the\ndatabaseclass  was actual part of the function reference (its location\nis not obvious). Another problem with the function reference is that\nit is hard to navigate. A better navigation structure (in my opinion)\ncan be found at the function reference at php.net. It is easy to\nnavigate, the pages for individual functions are all structured the\nsame and you know where you have to look for a particular function.\n3) The plugin API is documented very badly. With this, I'm referring\nto the documentation on the action/filterhooks. This page is just a\nlong list, where a large number of the hooks isn't documented at all.\nI think this is one of the most important parts of the developer\ndocumentation of Wordpress. Good documentation on how to write plugins\nis essential to lower the barrier for new developers.\nI'm aware of the fact that Wordpress is an open source project and\nthat documentation is traditionally a difficult part of open source\nprojects. However, I think that Wordpress is doing very good on this\npoint and that the documentation is very complete. But I think that if\nthe structure of the documentation is improved, it can be a lot more\nusable and make plugin and theme development easier.\nThe most important thing is seperate how-to's and tutorials from the\nreference documentation. Additionally, a central page for plugin\ndevelopment should be created. This page should containg links to a\nclear function reference and actions/filter-hook reference. The\ncurrent page on plugin development is good, but more a tutorial. A\nlink to this page can be added as well (of course). The reference\ndocumentation should be structured better, function reference should\nfollow a strict pattern.\nOf course, I'm willing to help improve the documentation of Wordpress,\nbecause I'm using it rather intensively and like the 'simplicity' of\nit (creating plugins and themes is very easy to do).\n--\nMartin Sturm",

It is very hard to find the\n\u003e thing you're looking for. Especially when writing plugins I notice\n\u003e this problem.\nHi Martin,\nYou have made some good points, and I have actually been working on \ncleaning up the developer documentation along many of the same lines, \nbut there is more to do. In answer to your specific points:\n\u003e 1) Tutorials, howto's and reference documentation seems to be mixed\n\u003e togheter. While tutorials and howto's can be useful in some cases,\n\u003e they are distractive when you're looking for one particular function\n\u003e or method.\nCan you be more specific? I have been trying to make this separation \non pages that I have edited, but if you have specific suggestions for \npages that need to be broken up, that would be good.\n\u003e 2) The function reference (which is not easy to find, I only noticed\n\u003e it after a while) is not structured very well. [and most of the functions are not documented...]\nIt is definitely true that more of the functions need to be \ndocumented... but at least they are all listed now. The problem is \nthat someone still needs to write about a zillion individual function \npages, or at least add short descriptions to the functions. Feel free \nto jump in and write them. There is a standard structure for function \ndocumentation, so if you write a function reference page, start by \ncopying an existing function doc page and go from there.\nAlso, can you suggest better categories? I would be happy to \nreorganize the list, and definitely functions can be listed in more \nthan one section. For my first pass at getting all the functions at \nleast listed, I just used the categories that were there previously. \nBut there is no reason that it cannot be made better.\nWhat other navigation features do you think would be good? You \nmentioned php.net as a good example -- what navigation features does \nit have that we should try to emulate, given that we are working \nwithin the WordPress Codex, which contains documentation for everyone \nfrom casual users to hard-core developers?\n\u003e 3) The plugin API is documented very badly. With this, I'm referring\n\u003e to the documentation on the action/filterhooks. This page is just a\n\u003e long list, where a large number of the hooks isn't documented at all.\nAgain, someone needs to document them. Each one should have at least a \n  short description, but someone needs to write these descriptions. \nPlease feel free to jump in...\n\u003e  Additionally, a central page for plugin\n\u003e development should be created. This page should containg links to a\n\u003e clear function reference and actions/filter-hook reference. \nThe central place for plugin development exists:\nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation\nThanks for your input!\n      Jennifer\n-- \nJennifer Hodgdon\nPoplar ProductivityWare * www.poplarware.com\nWeb Databases/Scripts * Modeling/Analysis/Palm OS Software",

You may have seen notices to the forum and theme\n\u003e review contributor groups recently leading to a survey intended to identify\n\u003e a group liaison as we begin the work of creating more collaboration and\n\u003e integration between contributor groups. Unlike Forums and TRT, I can't run\n\u003e a report to see a list of posting frequency, commits, etc (and neither can\n\u003e Otto), so the survey for the Docs team is a little more free form. It\n\u003e basically asks you to identify who on the docs team you consider to be:\n\u003e - most active\n\u003e - most helpful\n\u003e - best quality writing/editing\n\u003e\n\u003e If you could fill in the survey within the next day or two, that would be\n\u003e great. It will help with figuring out how many active contributors wo have,\n\u003e and as we start to talk about the possibility of organizing a contributor\n\u003e summit (like the core team meetup, but all the contributor groups), knowing\n\u003e how many people are involved, active, lapsed, etc will be important.\n\u003e\n\u003e The survey is at http://wordpressdotorg.**polldaddy.com/s/docs-**\n\u003e contributor-survey\u003chttp://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/docs-contributor-survey\u003e\n\u003e In an attempt to reduce spam, it is password protected: wordpressdocs2012\n\u003e\n\u003e Thanks!\n\u003e Jane\n\u003e ______________________________**_________________\n\u003e wp-docs mailing list\n\u003e wp-docs at lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/**mailman/listinfo/wp-docs\u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs\u003e\n\u003e\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/attachments/20120401/d787da3b/attachment.htm\u003e",

    "body": "Challenged by missing files in a few of the Themes I've been downloading, I asked a question on the forums at http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=26038 and found out that by default, if a file is missing but called from the theme, it picks it up from the default theme.  The problem comes in styling conflicts, if there are or aren't styles within those files.\nSpecifically, I found some Themes missing comment files, but there may be others missing.\n1. We need to put this information in the Codex anywhere that involves developing or designing themes.\n2. Anywhere that discusses or instructs on themes needs to have this information - I'm talking about source code documentation, external websites, wherever we can think of.\n3. Information for those hosting Theme contests or design contests which involve Themes need to make sure that designers either include all the basic files or allow for CSS that adjusts the default files they leave out.\nI'm jumping on this because of the contest currently running and because of the bazillions wanting to get into the Theme biz and grabbing info from the Codex.  It's got to be really clear.\nLorelle VanFossen\nNew web site address and email:  www.cameraontheroad.com\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/attachments/20050304/dbe211ea/attachment.html",

    "body": "I'm looking for some input on the \"Testing WordPress Performance\" [1] \npage for the WordPress Optimizations category. I have a tendency to \nramble on and add irrelevant information. I was wondering if anyone \nwanted to look over the page and give suggestions on possible \ncorrections or make corrections to finished portions.\nThe specific purpose of the guide is to inform the developer how to best \ngo about testing the performance and walk the developer through the \nsteps to install two different PHP extensions in order to do so.\nThe Xdebug section is finished, the MySQLnd section is not. The MySQLnd \nsection will be difficult, but it is built for PHP 5.3. PHP 5.3 hasn't \nbeen released, the MySQLnd driver/library is incomplete and can be \nconsidered unstable (alpha). It is also only (currently) for the mysqli \nextension, which not supported by WordPress. PDO support is being added, \nbut that is even more unsupported by WordPress and unstable.\nThe reason to discuss mysqlnd driver/library, is that it has useful \nstatistical data for MySQL. Sure you can use the MySQL utilities to get \nthe same information, but the goal is to discuss this all within the \ncontext of WordPress and PHP. It would make better sense to discuss how \nto get the statistical data to better track SQL query performance and \noverhead. However, that is outside the scope of my knowledge. I do know \nPHP and so that is what I'm going to discuss in the article.\nI think I will create a note for it for future inclusion, when I do more \nresearch on the subject. I do mention WinCacheGrind for Xdebug profiling.\nAlso, if you don't mind, I'll want to maintain the page for now. I'm \nprobably going to modify it during the Summer and will no longer \nmaintain the guide afterwards. That is if PHP 5.3 is released. There are \nsome notes in the guide about PHP 5.3 in the future tense and will need \nto be changed to past/present tense after the PHP 5.3 release.\n[1] http://codex.wordpress.org/Testing_WordPress_Performance",

The list of plugins was \ngetting huge, and the wiki software recommended that it be broken up into \nmanageable chunks.\nWhat I did was to take the sections on the page and create a sub-page with that \nsection name. I also created a template, {{PluginIndex}} that I used on the \nbottom of every category page. The template is simply a link back to the main \nPlugin page.\nSo, any plugin should now be placed within an appropriate category, and should \nNOT get its own page.\nAlso, during the Codex down time, a lot of cruft has made its way into the \npages. Specifically, apostrophes and other punctuation marks have randomly been \nturned into gibberish. All of the plugin pages need a thorough edit for typos \nand this nastiness.\nAlso, there are many dead links, so if we could do some URL hunting, that would \nbe good.\nCheck out the new look:\nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins\nCraig.",

It's also useless for categories\nand tags, because is_tax() is exclusively custom taxonomies, and returns\nfalse for these.\nIt *does* work for post formats, but it looks like we should be adding a\nwrapper function there for a conditional tag for post format pages.

I'd imagine ADA would apply in the US.\nLegality aside, there are the ethical responsibilities to ensure that \ndisabled users can create sites as easily as possible. And there are \nquite a few disabled users who use WordPress as their CMS of choice - \nprimarily because it already offers a reasonable level of accessibility. \nBut that doesn't mean it can't be improved. We also need to teach people \nhow to get the best of the features that it offers. :-)\nAFAIIA, Section 508 only applies to the public-facing side of (federal?) \nsites. So the onus is really on the site owner but, again, I think we \nhave an ethical duty to help people create the most accessible sites \nthat they can.\nHTH\nesmi\n-- \nhttp://quirm.net\nhttp://blackwidows.co.uk",

        "body": "On the issue of WordPress \"preventing building accessible sites,\"\nthat's not true. Accessibility is mostly reliant upon Themes and\nPlugins. That must be clear, however, WordPress does not enforce\ncompliance with images and links which is part of the requirements for\naccessibility and part of the WordPress core programming. The only\n\"responsibility\" WordPress core can really offer, to my understanding,\nis compliance within the content area. The rest is Theme and Plugin\ndesign and programming elements to insure P.O.U.R. is met for\nperceivable, operable, understanding, and robust guidelines. WordPress\ncan do more in the core for mobility features and browser\ncompatibility on the backend, but the front end is Theme and Plugin\nauthors' responsibility.\nAn accessibility expert told me one time that it would be interesting\nto see a WordPress specific lawsuit over this. Would the site owner be\ncompletely liable or would some of the onus be on WordPress and/or the\nweb developer(s), Theme designers, and Plugin authors for\nnon-compliance. I think that's a valid question that needs answering\nto help protect all parties involved. Hold harmless can only go so\nfar, and we all know that ignorance of the laws means squat.\nI hope I am not muddying the waters. I just want to make sure that\ncompliance with international law is considered in the article so we\ncan best serve our audience. This is no longer an ethical decision but\na legal one. Having followed the lawsuits of these cases over the\nyears closely, there is a lot of legal involved, but it boils down to\nsimple things that could have been done right in the first place, if\npeople understood these are not ethical or \"right\" choices but the\nlaw.\nThanks!\nLorelle\nOn Fri, Nov 16, 2012 at 7:48 PM, James \u003cjames at thinkhuman.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e Lorelle wrote:\n\u003e\u003e With the new US federal law on web accessibility as of March 2012 in place,\n\u003e\u003e it is critical we explain how WordPress complies with P.O.U.R.

While exact numbers are hard to estimate without access to site \nstatistics, it looks like about 3000 changes have been made to the Codex \nsince then. More changes and release of documents are continuing as the \nCleanup team continues their cleaning.\n* While 21 people \"officially\" signed up, many more signed up for \nspecific tasks and made offers of help via the IRC Chat #wordpress-docs.\n* We put together a \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Cleanup/User_Statistics chart to track \nhow many people worked on the Codex and what their contributions were \nduring the 9 day event.\n* The Task list has been cleaned up to only show the lists of items \nawaiting activity and sign up at \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks.  The accomplished tasks have \nbeen moved to the discussion page: \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Codex_talk:Tasks.\n*The list of new articles submitted to Codex are as follows:\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Accessibility\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Add Link SubPanel\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding Asides\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Alphabetizing Posts\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Blog by Email\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing The Site URL\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Coloured Quicktags\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating a Search Page\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating Tables with Plugins\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating Admin Themes\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening WordPress\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/HTML to XHTML\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Links Manager - complete rewrite and revision\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Moving WordPress\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Site Architecture 1.5\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Styling for Print\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme Switching\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Using Images\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Using Javascript\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/Using Gravatars\n** http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress Cookies\nCategorizing the Codex:  While everyone on the Cleanup team has worked \nhard on this, special recognition needs to be given to the \"categorizing \nteam\" who categorized EVERY one of the more than 400 articles on the \nCodex. The categories are coordinated with the main table of contents \nand listed at the bottom of every page. This will help increase the \nconnection between related documents and improve user friendliness in \nthe Codex. It is a huge, boring task and kudos to them for plowing \nthrough it all.\n=======================\nSummary\nAs it stands now, the Codex Cleanup Week has been a resounding success. \nMany goals set for this project have been accomplished:\n* Increased awareness of the WordPress Codex as a resource\n* Improvement of the reputation of the WordPress Codex as a valued resource\n* Increased connection between the Forum and the Codex\n* Increased volunteer activity on the Codex.\n* Increased documentation\n* Improved checking and verification of documents from a \"team\" and not \nan individual resulting in documents released faster and better quality \nassurance\n* Improved communication\n* Development of a task list for directing volunteer efforts\n* The number of articles requiring copyright or expansion has been \nminimized. While some remain, they are the newest articles and/or are \nawaiting review and verification by experts.\nThe WordPress Documentation Team",

    "subject": "[wp-docs] Codex updates for 2.1?",
    "body": "I am cross-posting this to the Hackers and Docs lists, because I think \nit may require input from both communities.\nBeing a programmer who loves clear documentation, I've been looking \nover the about-to-be-released code for WordPress 2.1, and I have \nnoticed that several things have changed that a plugin or theme \ndeveloper would want to know (new filters, some functions deprecated, \netc.). I have also noticed that the Codex could probably use a bit of \nreorganization (it looks like several people have discussed this \nrecently in the Docs list archives; I just joined the list).\nSo what I am wondering is:\na) Are there plans to update the developer section of the Codex for \n2.1 changes? I didn't see any in the Docs list archives for Dec/Jan, \nand I just joined the list, so I am not sure.\nb) I am also wondering if it might make sense to start a whole new \ndeveloper area in the Wiki for 2.1, and in the process, reorganize the \nexisting developer documentation a bit.\nc) Once 2.1 is out, will the Wiki need to keep around all the \ninformation for 2.0.x as well?  For how long? And do we need some \ndocumentation on the changes (such as what a developer needs to do to \nensure plugin and theme migration, avoid deprecated functions, etc.)?\nThoughts? And yes, I am offering to help, and maybe even to organize \nprojects around this...\n     --Jennifer",

I \nthink the PDF files should be stored on the Codex, to save bandwidth \nissues in the future if they gain popularity, also to help other \nvolunteers contribute to their updating, and it would help to have some \nkind of obvious link to the document.\nNow, I firmly believe that if someone wants to view a specific Codex \narticle offline or in print form, saving it to their computer and/or \nhaving a really good print.css will replace the need for the PDF files. \nSo I'm not clear on how and who will be maintaining these as some of the \npages are constantly updated such as Themes and Plugins. Is there a team \nworking on keeping these updated yet? That's a LOT of work and we need \nto share the load when we start releasing a lot of new documents for 1.6 \nand having another clean up week.\nMost importantly, if they are to be included, we need to highlight them \nand we need to talk about how.\nLorelle",

This is following the \nsuggestion of developer Matt way back in 2004 on a WordPress support \nthread about the topic.[1]\nIn the interests of keeping my newly created page, \"Database \nSupport\"[2], from remaining bastardly, where might be a good place to \nprovide the link-to?  All the sections of the codex seem centered on \nend-user support, and not on developer discussion.  Should there be a \n\"Developer\" section on the Main Page?  Might be a good place to include \nthe wildly popular topics of feature requests \u0026c.\nDoes anyone object to the page name \"Database Support\" for this topic? \nI can see the verb \"support\" being ambiguous in this case; someone might \ngo to the page looking for help on getting their database set up, when I \nmean that which WordPress supports.  Any better suggestions?\n=Charlie\n[1] http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=549\n[2] http://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Support",

(trac\nticket, maybe?)\nFinally, while it's safer to salt passwords, should it be made a\nrequirements? Or can user simply live with un-salted passwords?\nThanks a lot for any information.\n-- \nXavier Borderie",

    "body": "In my continual quest to improve the documentation for developers on \nWordPress, I have made a To Do list:\nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/JHodgdon/Dev_Doc_To_Dos\nI am interested in your comments. If you are a developer who works on \nthemes, plugins, or the core sections of WordPress, what do you think \nneeds improvement in the Codex documentation? That could include \nnavigation problems, individual articles that need some attention, or \nnew articles that need to be written.\nRegarding navigation, I am assuming as a starting point that a \ndeveloper will find either Developer Documentation or Advanced Topics. \n(Lorelle?). Then, my idea is that all the links on link-listing pages \nshould be relevant and also annotated, and if the user is led to \nanother page of links, they should be told they are visiting a list of \nlinks, and that list should be something like \"Central repository for \nlinks related to themes and templates\", rather than just another \nrandom collection.\nAlso regarding navigation, I have taken \"Further Reading\" lists out of \na lot of the developer articles, in order to centralize maintenance of \nlink lists. For instance, if you read an article on writing a plugin, \nrather than having 3 links at the bottom for further reading, it \nshould direct you back to the central list of all plugin-related links.\nAnyway, please take a look at the To Do list and let me know what you \nthink. Also, could those of you who are already working on improving \nspecific developer-related documentation, or adding new pages, let me \nknow so that I can make a note of that on the To Do list page?\nThanks,\n     Jennifer\n-- \nJennifer Hodgdon\nPoplar ProductivityWare * www.poplarware.com\nWeb Databases/Scripts * Modeling/Analysis/Palm OS Software",

        "body": "Excellent list. Fantastic. I'm whelmed. And thrilled!\nHere are my thoughts.\n* The Loop - What did you have in mind for this? We have two articles on \nthe WordPress Loop. One is written as a basic technical explanation and \nthe other \"Loop in Action\" was written for the WordPress Lessons for a \nstep-by-step look at how to customize the loop for different needs. I'd \nlove to see more custom features for using the Loop in separate articles \nrelated to blog models and their specific needs, as well as these two \narticles updated.\n* Conditional Tags/Includes - I'd love to see a \"Conditional Tags in \nAction\" WordPress Lesson-style article that uses the conditional tags \nand includes in various methods, expanding upon the basic technical how \nto. The Conditional Tags article is really lacking in quality examples, \nbut it doesn't need to do everything. A WordPress Lesson can add more \nfeatures. It also needs to be edited and updated as it is not clear on \nhow it works within the code examples.\n* Hacking WordPress - WordPress Plugins have pretty much totally \nreplaced hacks. So we need to be sure how we are going to go forth in \nthe future with the issue of \"hacking\" WordPress while still being very \nclear that modifications to the core programming is NOT recommended, and \npotentially dangerous with the new frequency of upgrades coming out \nfaster than ever. What's the current policy?\n* Hardening WordPress - This is really, really controversial. I know \nit's not on your list, but security topics are and this is one of them. \nWe need to clearly address the issue of security flaws and potential \nrisks in WordPress, especially in WordPress Plugins, while not exposing \nflaws or potential \"back doors\" into WordPress. This is a big one and we \nreally need to get a consensus and policy on how to write about this \nbecause it is SO important, while not opening a door we don't want open.\nAdditional Articles\nI'd also like to recommend you include a few other articles to that list \nthat are on the Task List\n* http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Common_WordPress_Errors We \nreally need a better listing of the most common WordPress errors with \ntips on how to fix them such as errors during installation, mysql \nerrors, plugins not found errors...we need examples of what it looks \nlike when the error occurs as people often don't have the words or \nlanguage to describe the error, and then how to fix it. This would be \nexcellent as a reference for the Support Forum.\n* http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Foreign_Language_Characters - I \ndon't know how \"developer\" this is, or if I should hand it off to \nsomeone on polygots, but we need some articles on handling foreign \nlanguage characters in WordPress. WordPress now works well with \nright-to-left languages, but we need some technical articles on foreign \nlanguage techniques. Recent surveys are indicating a huge demand in \nJapanese, Chinese, and other Asian blogs, so we need coverage in English \non that so it can be translated by those support groups. Interested?\n* http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks#Custom_PHP_Queries - I see that \nDavid House signed up for this. Any idea if he is still working on an \narticle for custom PHP queries? Maybe we can get Kaf to work on this or \nhelp.\n* Do's and Don'ts for WordPress Plugins - I'd love to see a very \nspecific do's and don'ts for WordPress Plugin writers. I found some \narticles on Head Zoo ( \nhttp://headzoo.com/tutorials/writing-a-wordpress-plugin and \nhttp://headzoo.com/tutorials/wordpress-plugin-tips-and-tricks ) that may \nbe worth approaching the author for editing and inclusion in the Codex - \nor using some of the offerings for a new article. We really need some \nWordPress Lessons to help beginners learn to write WordPress Plugins as \nwell as technical articles. It is the hottest growing area and we need \nto create some very strong standards and offer articles on how to avoid \nsecurity holes, another big ickie.\nI haven't been through the Forum looking for article ideas for a while. \nHave you gone through the Advanced area to look for what is hot and the \nmost popular technical topics brought up? This is our best tool for \ndetermining what we need in the Codex. It's critically important that \nthe support volunteers have something to point to for redundant topics.\nGreat work and I'm so excited to get this area worked on. It is much overdo!\nLorelle",

My thanks go out to all who \nparticipated.\nMy question today is, what to do about the Codex's Function Reference:\n    http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference\nIt has always been incomplete and out of sync with the code. Does \nwordpress.org have plans to have an official replacement, generated \nfrom the PHPDoc, so we can get rid of the Function Reference once and \nfor all? There are several useful sites with cross-refs and such \nlisted at the bottom of the above Codex page, but none are \"official\". \nWhich would be the most useful? Are there any useful components of the \nCodex Function Reference that should be preserved? Thoughts?\nAnd what about the Template Tags page in the Codex? That is also prone \nto being out of sync, and could be replaced by phpdoc, maybe? We could \npotentially link to the appropriate files that should contain template \ntags.

        "body": "I am on this list but have never edited the codex. Forgive me for asking but\nI don't see your personal note? Can you reiterate here or did you just do\nso? :)\nNo moving from server to server is not the same but much is outside the\nrealm of WP. I havbe moved my blog around several times and it is quite\nsimple to do an account transfer from cPanel but not everyone has cPanel. If\nthey don't, here are rough steps (some outside of WP)\nAssuming the user can handle DNS changes for the domain:\n1. Create a new database on the new server.\n2. Dump current database to the new one. Easy way for newbies is to use\nphpMyAdmin to export from one then login to the other and import. However,\nif SSH is enabled on the new server and remote mysql access is enabled on\nthe old server, the simplest method is to run:\nbash$ mysqldump -h hostname -u username -p password wp_database | mysql -u\nnewuser -p newpassword new_wp_database\n3. Backup all files from old server, usually through FTP download to local\nand upload to new, though I like direct copy via scp from one server to the\nother.\n4. Edit wp-config.php with new database details.\n5. IF DNS resolution has been completed, login to wp-admin and change any\nnecessary details for the new location, including permalink structures (if\nnecessary). If DNS resolution is not complete, it might help in the interim\nto modify wp_options values for home and siteurl so it's not redirecting the\nuser to the old server while DNS changes.\nThere's a lot to cover. Using a cPanel account copy is the easiest though if\navailable for the user as you just put in account details on the old server\nand it copies over. If the user does not have WHM access, they may need to\nsupply info to the host.\nAaron Brazell____________\nEditor, Technosailor.com\nhttp://www.technosailor.com\n \n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:wp-docs-bounces@lists.automattic.com] On Behalf Of\nlorelle@cameraontheroad.com\nSent: Thursday, March 24, 2005 6:53 PM\nTo: WordPress Documentation\nA day or so ago I posted a note on \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Moving_to_a_new_server asking if the directions \nwere the same as moving WordPress from one directory to another - like from \na test directory.

Create a review list of the public guides online (good and bad) with\n\u003e comments.\n\u003e\n\u003e 2. Create a layout of the steps needed and linked to Codex and Learn\n\u003e articles/videos already available.\n\u003e\n\u003e 3. Proposals on how to fill in the gaps and create a TOC guide or\n\u003e step-by-step process to help those needing such guides within the Codex and\n\u003e help the Learn team find gaps.\n\u003e\n\u003e 4. Create a \"form\" on the Codex for groups to build upon for creating\n\u003e their own inhouse guide.\n\u003e\n\u003e This should help us really identify the gaps we have in documentation. It\n\u003e will also help all the documentation projects around WordPress without\n\u003e stepping on toes, I hope.\n\u003e\n\u003e Want to join the process?\n\u003e\n\u003e Thanks!\n\u003e\n\u003e Lorelle\n\u003e\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e wp-docs mailing list\n\u003e wp-docs at lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs\n\u003e\n\u003e\n-- \n-- \nAndrea Rennick, http://wpebooks.com and http://ronandandrea.com\nCo-author of WordPress All-In-One For Dummies http://rml.me/aio\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/attachments/20111219/89659aa3/attachment.htm\u003e",

Right now, it says that \"All content at this website \n\u003e (Codex) is provided for use under the terms of the GNU General Public \n\u003e License\". Says who ?\nThere should be one license for the entire body of work.  That license\nis the GPL.  If someone does not agree with that they shouldn't\ncontribute to codex.  The same as with the WP source.\n\u003e If the WP code is important enough to have it's contributors listed, \n\u003e then surely Codex is no less deserving ?\nSure.  Such a list can be generated from the changes list.  Since\neveryone is making changes under their own user name,  attribution is\ntracked by the wiki.  Due to the wiki, we have better attribution\ntracking for documentation than we do for the WP source.\n\u003e We do not know what the future holds, but everyone who has taken time to \n\u003e help has given their time freely and that needs protecting but with \n\u003e their name on it. Surely those people who have contributed OWN that GPL \n\u003e in the same way as the coders ?\nNo copyright assignment is required, so everyone retains rights to their\ncontributions.  Contributors retain copyright to their changes and agree\nto license them under the GPL by putting those changes on codex.  This\nis the same as with someone who gives us a patch for the source tree.\nYou must be careful with attribution under the GPL.  Distributors of a\nGPLed product cannot remove copyright headers, but they are not required\nto keep vanity links.  Requiring vanity links and advertising clauses is\na violation of the GPL and every other OSI (Open Source) approved\nsoftware license.\nIANAL.\nRyan",

I work with a lot of people\nbehind the scenes on the Codex and while I say jump in and introduce\nyourself on the Codex Mailing List, not all get around to it. :D\nAs I explain to many, the key way to first get involved in the Codex\n(besides entering the Community Portal link on the Codex sidebar and\ndigging into the styles and guidelines) is to edit. Exactly that. Start\ngoing through whatever articles interest you and look for spelling and\ngrammar mistakes. Remove all personal stories and ensure the documents are\nin second person familiar. Check resource links to ensure they meet our\nrequirements and continue to serve as pertinent reference material.\nAlong the way you will usually stumble on an article in desperate need of\nupdating. This way, you get a feel for what's in the Codex and how all the\nwiki bits work. It takes a bit of work to get into the Codex voice and\nstyle. If you find something that worries you or needs an answer, check in\nwith me or with the group and we'll help. There is a lot of history here\nand a lot of the other groups within WordPress sensitive about who is\ntouching their docs, so there is a lot to learn here. And it's all about\nthe team work here.\nWe have an amazing team that sit on the Codex constantly to ensure it is\nclean and free of spam and unwanted crap. No article really belongs to any\nsingle author (though some are protected as they tie in with WordPress\ncore) and we work collaboratively a lot. Many times people will put an\narticle up in their username space and invite us to attack with our red\npens and fix. We have dozens of volunteers that never chat on the Codex\ndiscussion list but dig deep into the Codex whenever there is a need. It's\nan amazing, versatile, and flexible group with a ton of self-starters.\nSo welcome and dig right in.\nAnd thanks so much for all the time you give.\nLorelle\nOn Mon, Apr 2, 2012 at 4:16 AM, Siobhan McKeown \u003csiobhan at wordmonkey.me\u003ewrote:\n\u003e I guess this a good time to introduce myself too.

With the examples on that page though, I'd be tempted not to use\ndefinition lists at all.

However, \nthe term is not accurate when a developer starts looking at code. The \nterms, \"template tag\" and \"function\" are the used in the same context.\nWell, that is to say Template Tags are functions. It is to also say that \nnot all functions are template tags. Just because a function can be used \nwithin a template does not make it a template tag.\nWhile I was editing wp_count_posts() Codex page [1], I noticed that it \nis under the Template Tag category. However, it is not within one of the \n*-template.php files, it is in the post.php file. This lead me into some \nconfusion, as most functions, which would be referred to as Template \nTags are within the *-template.php files.\nI would move the page, but I'm a n00b to the Codex, so I dare not \ndisplease the gods. In my opinion, it should be. Am I wrong with my \nassertion?\nIt also leads some confusion with a co-worker and myself. We both \nthought that Template Tags are majority used within The Loop, however \nthis might be narrow thinking on our part. Doing some checking, any \nTemplate Tag can be used outside The Loop easily, well it would take \nsome global hacking in order to do so.\nMy question is, where do you draw the line between functions (which \ndevelopers look for) and template tags which non-developers look for?\n[1] http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_count_posts\n-- \nJacob Santos\nhttp://www.santosj.name - blog\nhttp://funcdoc.wordpress.com - WordPress Documentation Blog/Guide Licensed under GPLv2\nAlso known as darkdragon and santosj on WP trac.",

It will help coders modifying the WordPress Admin by \ncreating patches or whatever to have it documented, but I have no \nmotivation to document it. If it isn't documented by Spring or Summer \nnext year, then I'll probably finish it.\nI did leave an update which stated that the effort was finally a \nsuccess. Other contributors are mostly maintaining the inline \ndocumentation now. It is nice that you are using it for the codex. That \nwas one of the intentions with no including more examples in the code.\nActually, the inline documentation does also include a link to the \ncodex, where applicable, for more examples and details. I think that \nonce you get more completed, I'll go through and create a patch linking \nmore of the functions to the codex.

See it on google... ;-P\nI decide to help admin namespace es: of codex because I have a lot of \nfree time and now im helping on spanish forum es.forums.wordpress.org.\nMany times im going to codex to copy/paste links with detailed help \nabout problems that people are asking there.\nNow i see many problems on it.\nThe biggest is that 90% of titles of articles are on english, perhaps \nbecause es: was created making copy/paste and translate it manually. But \nthis is a BAD idea because, how do you refer this article if you send a \nenglish link?\nFor example, http://codex.wordpress.org/es:Before_You_Install very \nuseful for spanish user who dont speak english.\nIm looking for a non destructive solution to solve it. Perhaps will be \nvery difficult to change all es: structure with a bot or similar.\nI dont know how many spanish users are on wiki working now.\nI'm noob on this wiki and i dont know any about your wikiettiquete and \nadmin chart.\nAny help will be graceful accepted.\nGreets.",

    "body": "I'm a new WordPress user.  The Codex is a big help.  But the layout (on \nFirefox under Linux, at least) could be better, I think.  On the Main \nPage, for instance, I get a very long center column that goes on for \nscreen after screen.  After the top screen, there's lots of whitespace \nat the left and right sides of this long/narrow column.  I'll attach a \nscreen shot of my second screen of ten.\nHave we considered using a different design/theme -- at least for the \nMain Page?  For instance, move all of the overall navigation links from \nthe columns to fill the entire top of the page... and let all of the \nother Codex pages appear below the top.  That would make much better use \nof the remaining space in the page.  As it is, having navigation at the \nleft and right of the first screen doesn't help people navigate when \nthey're on screens below; they still have to scroll back to the top to \nreach the overall navigation links.  Using columns like these only makes \nsense, I think, when the body content of the page is short.\nJerry\nP.S.

Not that how Automattic/WordPress.com organizes itself should \ndecide anything, but their support team manages forums, email support, \nand docs, and it seems to work pretty well. They have a schedule for \nreviewing existing documentation so it never gets too far out of date, \nand the people on the front lines with users in the forums and via email \ncan see very clearly where they need to beef up documentation. I'm \nthinking this could work well for .org, too. Those who are strong \nwriters and just want to contribute to documentation could still do so, \nbut within a context of what our user support needs are at any given \ntime based on the actual support requests.\nWhat I'm envisioning is less siloing of contributor personnel, with one \ngroup blog at make.wordpress.org/support that uses tags like forums and \ncodex to organize posts, and has pages to help orient new contributors \nand get them started. These mailing lists could fade away in favor of \nemail subscriptions from the blog, which are more easily searchable and \nwould be more visible to potential contributors. Within the uber-group, \nsome people would naturally gravitate toward specific tasks while others \nwould multi-task as they have been doing.\nOver time we could expand the purview of the group to include things \nlike moderating instructional videos and comments at wordpress.tv (and \nstart embedding appropriate videos into codex), possibly helping to \nstaff in-person help desks in local communities and/or at events like \nWordCamps and Meetups, etc. I think the prospects are pretty exciting, \nand I could see this becoming the biggest and most active of all the \ncontributor groups, which would be awesome.\nIf there are any strong objections to this approach, please reply to \nthis thread today so we can discuss. If not, and everyone is willing to \ngive this a shot and all work together (at least as an experiment for, \nsay, the next release cycle or two), I'll go ahead and set up the group \nblog tomorrow.\nJane",

They have a schedule for reviewing\n\u003e existing documentation so it never gets too far out of date, and the people\n\u003e on the front lines with users in the forums and via email can see very\n\u003e clearly where they need to beef up documentation. I'm thinking this could\n\u003e work well for .org, too. Those who are strong writers and just want to\n\u003e contribute to documentation could still do so, but within a context of what\n\u003e our user support needs are at any given time based on the actual support\n\u003e requests.\n\u003e\n\u003e What I'm envisioning is less siloing of contributor personnel, with one\n\u003e group blog at make.wordpress.org/support that uses tags like forums and\n\u003e codex to organize posts, and has pages to help orient new contributors and\n\u003e get them started. These mailing lists could fade away in favor of email\n\u003e subscriptions from the blog, which are more easily searchable and would be\n\u003e more visible to potential contributors. Within the uber-group, some people\n\u003e would naturally gravitate toward specific tasks while others would\n\u003e multi-task as they have been doing.\n\u003e\n\u003e Over time we could expand the purview of the group to include things like\n\u003e moderating instructional videos and comments at wordpress.tv (and start\n\u003e embedding appropriate videos into codex), possibly helping to staff\n\u003e in-person help desks in local communities and/or at events like WordCamps\n\u003e and Meetups, etc. I think the prospects are pretty exciting, and I could\n\u003e see this becoming the biggest and most active of all the contributor\n\u003e groups, which would be awesome.\n\u003e\n\u003e If there are any strong objections to this approach, please reply to this\n\u003e thread today so we can discuss. If not, and everyone is willing to give\n\u003e this a shot and all work together (at least as an experiment for, say, the\n\u003e next release cycle or two), I'll go ahead and set up the group blog\n\u003e tomorrow.\n\u003e\n\u003e Jane\n\u003e ______________________________**_________________\n\u003e wp-docs mailing list\n\u003e wp-docs at lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/**mailman/listinfo/wp-docs\u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs\u003e\n\u003e\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/attachments/20120515/38299e6a/attachment.htm\u003e",

For those new to this concept, it is like a \n\"podcast\" but basically an animated/video-like display of screen shots. \nAn example would be installing WordPress. A link to the screencast would \nbe on the Installing WordPress Codex article page, giving users a chance \nto read through the documentation and/or view the animated process of \nhow to install WordPress.\nI've set up a page on the Codex to take notes on how this may work and \nprovide links to examples and other things and open this up to \ndiscussion here, and in that page's discussion page.\nWe will need someone to coordinate this with the Codex.  I've talked to \na couple people about this and I'm awaiting their answer. We will also \nneed volunteers to take on the fun of making such screencasts.  There \nare a lot of decisions and information to gather, like which articles \nwould best be suited to this, decisions about software, and how to \ncoordinate this effort.\nIt's very exciting.  Let's start making plans and begin to put this into \neffect. See: http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Screencasts for more \ninformation and to sign up.\nLorelle",

    "body": "As a user, I'm liking the idea of the word \"Panel\" for the various screens, interchangable with \"screen\".

So an instruction might be:\n     From the Manage panel, click on the Categories tab from the menu.\nI'd like to see the references to these things stay consistent, if I have any say. The pages Pages thing makes me nuts.  So if you create a new \"menu\" on an Admin panel, then it should be a toolbar menu looking thing.

I think we all need to \nreview a lot of other online manuals to keep a good perspective on what \nthe Codex has to offer. Remember, we are \"promoting\" the Codex as an \n\"online manual\" not a wiki, and this raises the bar on quality.\nThe breadcrumb system that connects the categorized documents at the top \nof the articles are nice, as are the clear changable menus on the left \nof the articles. The idea of adding a PayPal or other form asking for \ndonations is also nice and something worth considering for the Codex. \nCheaper than buying the book. ;-)\nThe new addition of categories to the Codex begins the process of \nconnecting \"breadcrumb\" like navigation.\nWhile some of the documentation is simple and clear, the usage of the \nhandbooks as a forum for dialog with comments within the documentation \nadds clutter and opinions rather than facts.  I found that confusing and \ntedious to read through.  People would tell their stories and make \nexcuses before getting to the point. The Codex works hard on eliminating \nthe \"stories\" and getting readers to the point as fast as possible, \nkeeping the manual feeling through much of the documentation. I think we \nshould stay on track with that.\nI really like the blue tones against the white page but the two sidebar \nadd a lot of clutter. Viewed at 800x600, this page is a cluttered mass \nand difficult to read. Even with my new 19\" monitor at a high \nresolution, the page still feels cluttered.  I think adding colors and \nnavigation boxes to the Codex in the future is good, but I seriously \nrecommen that we keep to a one sidebar look with the majority of \nemphasis on the content not the clutter.\nI think we should start a discussion about how different online manuals \nlook and work and begin to collect information and opinions on how to \nimprove the Codex. We now have a good body of work, but there are still \nHUGE gaps in the documentation.  Per request from Matt and Carthik, I \nput together a \"comparison\" of one blogging software's table of contents \nagainst the Codex, which helped to generate a lot of the articles on the \nCodex:Tasks list and this needs to be worked on some more: \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_Wanted\nI also want to be clear, and speaking a little on behave of Carthik, \nthat we need to continue the emphasis on the content, and slowly work on \nchanging the look of the Codex. I think the best and possibly fastest \nchange to the Codex would be replacing the sunflower with a WordPress \nlogo of which there are some neat examples in the Codex Image Library \nthat would work temporarily, and making the CSS changes requested last \nweek of Matt.\nWhat say you?\nLorelle",

Here is a list of holes that \nI see:\n* http://codex.wordpress.org/Integrating_Wordpress_with_Your_Website - \nConstantly requested, NO information.\n* Simple things like an article on how to activate the popup comments \ntemplate, styling footers, and very basic information on themes and \ntemplate tags.\n* Conditional Tags and various queries - people are constantly asking \nquestions about customizing queries and we have very little information \nto help people use conditional tags step-by-step to customize their post \nand template outputs.\n* Foreign Language Installs and Support: I'm working with Moshu to clean \nup the mess and hopefully that will be ready next week but we need more \non this subject.\n* Development: the Codex is SERIOUSLY lacking in documentation to help \ndevelopers and future developers. This includes development and writing \nof plugins. Some articles are underway but we need more.\n From http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Articles_Wanted, Common \nWebsite Setups, highlighting each one as an article with possibly links \nto other articles for content that crosses models:\nBasic Weblog Model\n    * Basic Article Output and the Concept of Article Flow\n    * Adding Article Archive to the Process\n    * Expanding Your Site with Pages and Content\n    * Custom Article Output with WordPress Categories\nIntermediate Weblog Model\n    * Adding Plugins to Your WordPress\n    * Adding post popularity and ratings via plugins or otherwise\n    * Adding Substructure to Your Site\n        * Site Map\n        * Custom Template pages/Pages\n    * Controlling User Levels\n    * Link Checking\n    * Site Statistics and Monitoring\n    * Controlling Comments\nPhotoblog, Portfolio or Photo Gallery Model\n    * Theme based upon images not text\n    * Loop customization for image oriented posts\n    * Integrating Gallery Plugins/Add-ons\n    * Adding Graphics/Photographs to Site (Thumbnails, etc.)\nBusiness Site Model (CMS)\n    * Adding E-commerce\n    * Adding Ads (globally and per post)\n    * Sign-ups/Registrations\n    * Controlling User Levels\n    * Controlling Comments\n    * Mailing Lists\n    * Contact Forms\n    * Managing Links Internally and Externally\n    * Link Checking\n    * Site Statistics and Monitoring\nReview Site Model\n    * Rating Items Pages\n    * Category/Individual Post styles\n    * Controlling User Levels\n    * Link Checking\n    * Site Statistics and Monitoring\n    * Controlling Comments\nThis is just a start, and there is more on the Codex:Tasks List. I'd \nlike to put together a list of what other holes are missing in the \ndocumentation. So where are the holes you see in the documentation? Add \nthem here and I'll put them on the Task List.\nLorelle",

This is not \nto say that documenting it is a bad idea.\nI can't think of a good reason for WordPress plugins to use PHP \nsessions, really.

    "body": "I've started the WordPress Lessons section on my user page at \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle#Articles_for_Lesson_Tutorials and \nstarted to group them together by category.  In doing so, I'm having some \ntrouble figuring out where to put things and what categories should be \nincluded.  I talk about this on my user page and have opened up a debate on \nmy discussions page about this.  Chime in, please.\nI've done roughs of a bunch of the proposed lessons and posted them.  Please \nreview, slash, and burn, but remember, I haven't even had a chance to do \nmuch of a second or third go around with these.\nI talked with Carthik for a few minutes this weekend about the title of the \nWordPress Lessons and I really like calling them WordPress Lessons.  If you \nhave an opinion on that, let us know, but I like the idea of that name and \nthen using the linking technique of calling them \"Lesson: How to dn \nSomething\" when linked to from other pages on the codex that require an \narticle title.  Stands out, says what it is, differentiates it from \ntechnical documentation as a how-to, and...well, what do you think?\nAnd he mentioned listing this on the Main Page as a separate section. I \nthink that is wise since it is of benefit to the majority of WordPress \nUsers.  WordPress is so EASY to use, a lot of people are embracing it and \nthen wanting to dig in to find out more, so I think this is a good thing. \nIt will lead people to dig deeper into the Codex to the rest of the \ndocumentation by giving them a non-lethal, non-tech intro with links to the \nlethal tech material...ah ha! BURN!  ;-)\nNow, about those Lesson articles.\nPlease review the Lessons very carefully.  On the more technical issues \ninvolving some template tags, I've test driven most of the, but not all of \nthem, so double check that I didn't screw up a tag or code example. \nRemember - I still very much a newbie at how WordPress works and a tired \nstip of the hinger and dah code ez messed upped. And remember again, I \nhaven't even gone through them since cleaning them up enough to post.  I'm \nsure I screwed up in places.\nAbout Lessons Guidelines and Purpose:\nI've also added a very rough draft and start to some guidelines for \nsubmission to the Lesson section.  This is NOT meant to turn into official \nguidelines but to help me (and all you wonderful and worthy Codex helpers) \nprocess what we want and don't want out of these lessons.\nPLEASE chime in on these.\nThe basic goal of the Lessons in the Codex is to help people learn how to \nuse WordPress, especially how to use the tags, process the overwhelming \ninformation and technology that goes into the WordPress features, and how to \nmaximize these features on their own WordPress site.\nThe number one criteria for inclusion in Lessons, IMHO, is that the lesson \nmust benefit the MAJORITY of WordPress users, not the minority.\nI am not qualified to write on techie how to topics for WordPress, but I'd \nlove to have people submit Lessons on techie topics such as how to change \nthe excerpt and post content text area in the Admin to make it larger or \nsmaller; understanding more about how pingbacks, trackbacks, and RSS works \nin relationship to a WordPress site.  For example, do these help your link \npopularity and rise in the search engines? Does the user have to \"turn it \non\" or is it on by default?  Can they turn them off? What good do they do? \nHow can they be customized to do what you want?  Sure, the tags and glossary \nand a few pages list some of this information, but a how-to-use on these \nwould be great.\nI'm sure there are plenty of other techie topics that I would absolutely \nlove to see added, but I'm tired out from Weekend Wikiness and I'll post \nsuggestions on my user page later.\nSo go through the Lessons and take a look.  If the link is red - obviously I \nhaven't added anything yet.  Still working on them.  Sorry that they are \n\"empty\" pages, but this is MY USER PAGE and not for the general public.  The \nred link reminds/haunts/guilts/encourages me to get the article done.\n:::As a reminder to those new on the discussion group, these Lessons started \nout as a cover for when the Codex was down for an extended period and v1.5 \nhad just come out and people were going nuts on how to use it.  We posted \n\"Lesson: title of lesson\" on the WordPress forum and they were a big hit. \nRequests came in to preserve this information and to add such information to \nthe Codex to benefit all WordPress users.  From there...avalanche.\nLorelle",

    "body": "WordCamp Developers asked me a few months ago if there was a way to have the\nWordCamp give back to WordPress by contributing to the WordPress Codex. I've\nbeen working with them and their WordPress Meetup group volunteers and a few\nbehind the scenes folks to get this rocking. I'm really excited about how\nthis is all going to work.\nWe've set up a blog with for managing the effort through the month of May.\nIt's the WordPress Codex Documentation Things to Do List blog at\nhttp://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/.\nI've put together an initial announcement about the May 5 event and month\nlong effort:\nhttp://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/celebrate-the-8th-birthday-of-wordpress-by-contributing-to-the-codex/\nThe how tos are:\nhttp://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/how-to-help-the-wordpress-codex/ and\nhttp://wpdocsteam.wordpress.com/writing-tips-for-the-wordpress-codex/\nHere is what we need to do.\n1. Get a list of what needs doing added to the blog with clear directions.\n2. If you can participate on May 5 or during the month, we'll need your help\non the blog, in the Codex, and on the IRC (reminder it's on the FreeNode IRC\nat #wordpress-docs).\n3. Spread the word.\nA key help will be to monitor Recent Changes to ensure that no evil slips\nthrough and to double check additions and changes to make sure they are\nright, as you all have the expertise and experience to know right from\nwrong.\nThanks so much to the WordCamp Developer team for kicking us in the buns to\nget the Codex updated. With all the developers attending, they really wanted\nto get their participants to give back to the WordPress Community, so what\nbetter way to do that!\nI know that there has been a lot of confusion, lack of information, and\nupdates on the WordPress Handbooks. I've heard from Jane that she went ahead\nwith a new team of volunteers to create those, and it is my understanding\nthat the WordPress Codex articles may be used in those handbooks, but that\nthe Codex will continue to grow as a tips, techniques, and coverage of how\nto use WordPress beyond those handbooks. We've yet to discus how exactly all\nthat is going to happen, and what the future holds, but this month is a\nchance to really get the Codex updated as it stands and generate a lot of\nnew energy, and help people who want to volunteer give back and help others\nto celebrate the birthday month of WordPress.\nThanks in advance for all your help, in the past, now, and future. This has\nbeen a labor of love for a long time for many and it is much appreciated.\nLorelle\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/attachments/20110426/035b0161/attachment.htm\u003e",

        "body": "The WPMU functions pages generally have pretty slow development (you've \nprobably noticed!), I guess because it's a bit of a specialised area, so \nit's great to have another keen, young contributor on the scene!  There \nwas a flurry of activity a couple of months ago which I think has died \ndown a little.  Perhaps your enthusiasm will rub off (I'm meaning on me, \nas well as anyone else who's feeling guilty about not contributing very \nrecently, here).  And I don't even mean any of that as patronisingly as \nit sounds.  I guess you're Ctsttom.\nI'm a little concerned that the 'Family' section you've added to some of \nthe functions (I presume the plan is to add it to all the function \ndocumentation given it's in the template you've made) is going to be \ndifficult to manage and could get pretty unwieldy while not being the \nmost helpful thing in the world.  I know quite a few of the main \nfunctions, and some of the MU functions, include a related functions \nsection.  What's the advantage of splitting related functions up into \nthese specific family sections rather than the less specific related \nfunctions way?\nI notice also you created the WPMU Functions category which is basically \njust the same as the WPMU Functions page.  While I appreciate it's \nhelpful to have them all in one place, I'm not keen on the near exact \nreplication of the two (and, to be honest, in my opinion there aren't \nenough MU pages to make the main category so mind-bogglingly complex \nthat the new category is strictly required).  Looking at the main WP \nfunction reference /page/ the added value of that page (over the \nFunctions /category/) is that it groups the functions further and adds \nmore narrative.  Did you have plans along those lines for the WPMU \nFunctions page?  I'd be interested to hear other people's opinions on \nthat -- perhaps I'm just too used to the way things are now to see the \nbenefit here :)\nApologies I've rattled on for so long.  As I say: it's great to have \nanother MU contributor and I just got excited.  My estimation is that \nwe'll get to the end of documenting the WPMU functionality just in time \nfor the WP3 launch party ;)\nC.\nTom Lynch wrote:\n\u003e Hello\n\u003e\n\u003e My name is Tom and I just wanted to introduce my self..\n\u003e\n\u003e I was frustrated with the lack of documentation in the WPMU Functions \n\u003e section so I decided to work on the section so far I have done a fair \n\u003e bit and I am continuing to work through all the functions.\n\u003e\n\u003e I was just wondering if anyone would like to review my changes so far \n\u003e to ensure I am doing things right and give me a bit of feedback about \n\u003e what I have been doing.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Kind Regards\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Tom Lynch\n\u003e\n\u003e ++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\u003e\n\u003e T: +44 (0)7786 540 167\n\u003e E: me at unknowndomain.co.uk\n\u003e\n\u003e ++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\u003e\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e wp-docs mailing list\n\u003e wp-docs at lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs",

The results of the recent surveys to identify active\n\u003e contributors and elect team reps made it pretty clear that the docs team\n\u003e is in a bit of a slump, organizationally speaking. Only 5 people from\n\u003e the wp-docs post responded, and of those, 2 were new or not yet\n\u003e contributing, and there was no consensus re reps among the remaining 3\n\u003e respondents. It got me thinking about how we organize contributors, what\n\u003e has worked well elsewhere in the WP ecosystem and in other free software\n\u003e projects, and leads me to this proposal: what if we combined forums and\n\u003e docs into one Support team?\n\u003e\n\u003e Looking back at the Codex activity from the past six months or year,\n\u003e chunks of it have been tied to forum mods (like Ipstenu and Andrea_r),\n\u003e other contributor groups (like Chip on the Theme Review Team), and new\n\u003e releases. Not that how Automattic/WordPress.com organizes itself should\n\u003e decide anything, but their support team manages forums, email support,\n\u003e and docs, and it seems to work pretty well. They have a schedule for\n\u003e reviewing existing documentation so it never gets too far out of date,\n\u003e and the people on the front lines with users in the forums and via email\n\u003e can see very clearly where they need to beef up documentation.

Probably, it is a misunderstanding from the \n\u003e GPL FAQ that addresses how programs with restrictive license plug-ins \n\u003e cannot be distributed as a combined work.\nMost plugins must use a GPL-compatible license.  From the GPL FAQ:\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLAndPlugins\n      \"It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins. If the program\n      uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are\n      separate programs, so the license for the main program makes no\n      requirements for them.\n      If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function\n      calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form\n      a single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the\n      main program and the plug-ins. This means the plug-ins must be\n      released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license,\n      and that the terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins\n      are distributed.\n      If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication\n      between them is limited to invoking the `main' function of the\n      plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a\n      borderline case. \"\nIt is my understanding of this FAQ that most WordPress plugins are \ncovered by the second paragraph.  Most plugins use the $wpdb object, and \nmake use of template tags and other internal structures.  In this way, \nthey are not functional on their own.  Since they require the GPL'ed \nproduct to function, and since they share data structures with the \nGPL'ed program, they too are bound by the terms of the GPL.\n\u003e Obviously, if a person writes a plug-in from scratch (as opposed to \n\u003e using existing GPL, or otherwise, licensed code) and uses the public \n\u003e WordPress API, the plug-in copyright rests completely with the author \n\u003e and the GPL doesn't have any avenue to impel the author to license the \n\u003e plug-in under GPL, or any other license. Obviously, the author could not \n\u003e combine the plug-in with WordPress and distribute them together, since \n\u003e that would violate the WordPress GPL license for distribution. But, the \n\u003e author could distribute the plug-in separately under any license, and \n\u003e licensed users could install the plug-in on their WordPress \n\u003e installation, creating a \"combined work\" for their own use, within the \n\u003e WordPress GPL license.\nIf someone writes a plugin that does not use _any_ internal WordPress \nfunctions or objects, they could then license their plugin however they \nwish.  For example, David Pankhurst's utopia1.php, available when you \npurchase his \"Top Ten Search Optimization Tricks for WordPress\" book, \n(apparently) does not use any internal WordPress functions or data (so I \nam told -- I have not looked at the code).\nSee here for additional info on this:\nhttp://www.skippy.net/blog/2005/07/09/free-as-in-freedom/\n\u003e I think it would be less grating to generous authors to encourage them \n\u003e to distribute their plug-in under the GPL or other open-source licenses, \n\u003e rather than try and force them to do so. Trying to force generosity \n\u003e might be taken the wrong way. I know that's the way I felt when I saw \n\u003e the new sentence. Encouraging GPL licensing by appealing to authors' \n\u003e community-minded generosity and via other perks (like hosting on \n\u003e wp-plugins.org) might come across better, and be more accurate.\nI think it's important not to abuse the GPL, nor to encourage abuses of \nit.  Licensing issues can become murky for armchair legal practitioners. \n  I think the sentence against which you are railing is an appropriate \none, and that it should remain.\n-- \nskippy@skippy.net | http://skippy.net/\ngpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 9CFA4B35\n506C F8BB 17AE 8A05 0B49  3544 476A 7DEC 9CFA 4B35",

However, learn.WordPress.com isn't a sufficient resource (from what I've observed) regarding training on the fundamental aspects of WordPress as it's released to hosted sites because it's geared to training about WordPress.com - which is not the same thing technically.\nWhat about a learn.WordPress.org? It could function exactly like the codex does but be focused on training.

I decided to look around and \nsee what I could do.  I didn't know a php from a pot to piss in, but I've \nbeen doing technical writing for years so I figured that a poke and a prod \nat the occassional missed spell and bad grammer might ease my guilt at the \n\"free\" part.  Especially since I was having so much fun (albeit many a \nmoment of pulling hair) with WordPress.\nI realized that some of the folks writing the material in the Codex were \nhardened criminals - I mean hardened WordPress gurus, calloused and \ndesensitized to the stress and determination of the \"newbie\".  (I can \npicture the developers now, hunched backs from hauling years of PHP code in \nsacks slung over their backs, sweat pouring from their brow, grease from \ndigging into the innards of mySQL and back-breaking code sequences.....Ain't \nI the clever word girl, today!  ;-)  ) The hard stuff was coming out but the \nsimple \"how do I make sense out of this massively insane nested list thing \nin the sidebar\" type issues weren't being addressed very well in the new \ncodex.  As a newbie in WordPress, I could ask the dumb questions that the \nmasses were asking, and make sure that the dumb answers would start \nappearing in the Codex to help other newbies like me.\nIn other words:\nNEWBIES WANTED\nLeap in, give us your \"how comes\" and \"what fors\".  This isn't the place to \nget technical support, but if there is an issue that isn't being covered, we \nneed to know.  If there is an issue you needed to know about and figured \nout, which probably applies to a couple other thousand folks out there, then \nwrite something up.  Massacre and destroy the English (or whatever) \nlanguage, just get it down and the rest of us will fix it and save other \npeople the grief you suffered in the learning process.\nNow that I've been hanging around for a while, they sucked me in from being \na lurking editor to a contributing pain in their buns, so if you enjoy it, \nyou will stick around.  But we need your contribution, okay!  Pick up a \nshovel and start digging.  We need you!\nAnd don't worry.  Like all freebie volunteer efforts, we're no different. \nThe abuse will come soon enough. hee hee.\nLorelle",

I tried Owen Winkler's plugin,  \nbut the buttons that appear are ridiculously huge, and no amount of css  \nstyling will reduce them in size. I want them to be styled roughly the  \nsame as the toolbar in the write post panel.  I believe, (or think I read  \nsomewhere), that there is a method of using the quicktags.js  in comments,  \nbut have found no info about this anywhere, apart from said plugin. Maybe  \ninfo about this could go in the comments section?

    "body": "Hello,\n     I am new to the list, but not to WordPress, PHP or programming. I\nhave a strong Perl, CSS, HTML background. I have been playing with PHP\nfor about year and have several WordPress installations running.\n     I would like to tackle editing some the individual function pages\nlike http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_option. I can \nspend an hour or two each weekday in December editing pages and perhaps \nmove on to create missing pages after I get my feet wet.\n     I would first like to discuss a standard page structure. I looked at\nthe reference material on Codex style, one year of list archives and\nthe Template Tags reference. It seems the typical page structure for a\nTemplate Tag is as follows (this example came from: \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_content):\n== Description ==\n== Usage ==\n== Examples ==\n     === Example 1 ===\n     === Example 2 ===\n     === Example 3 ===\n== Parameters ==\n== Related ==\n     {{Tag Post Tags}}\n     {{PHP Function Tag Footer}}\n     I think I would prefer to assume:\n     * Any documentation is obsolete the moment it is posted.\n     * The reader is using the latest stable version of WordPress.\n     * The reader is not a professional or experienced programmer.\n     * This is the first page the reader has viewed in the Codex.\n     * The reader wants to know where the function is defined within the\n       source code.\n     * 3 good examples of a function is wishful thinking. :)\n     Here is a proposed outline of what I'd like to see in for individual\nfunction pages. While I know what I want form the Codex, I don't know\nwhat others might want. I do know that I don't want to start editing\npages without a least a hint of a plan.\n     Also, is there an easy way to report the date this page was last\nupdated? Or which WordPress version was active when it was last updated?\n== Description ==\n     Tell the reader what this function does at the time this description\n     was written without jargon or abbreviations. Don't, for example,\n     assume the reader knows what a rewrite rule is.\n== Usage ==\n     %%%\u003c?php usage goes here ?\u003e%%%\n     %%%\u003c?php usage goes here ?\u003e%%%\n     %%%\u003c?php usage goes here ?\u003e%%%\n== Examples ==\n     === Example 1 ===\n     === Example 2 ===\n     === Example 3 ===\n== Parameters ==\n     This function does not accept parameters.\n     - or -\n     === Parameter 1 ===\n     === Parameter 2 ===\n     === Parameter 3 ===\n== Recent Changes ==\n     Recent changes in this function's use.

    "body": "Hi there,\nIf any of you people are up for this please read on or contact me on\nthis email address, or via discussion on this list.\nNice one, Mick\n--WordPress Flossmanuals Book Jog--\nInvite also here - http://blog.booki.cc/\nWe're off to a bit of a slow start, but the Book Jog us underway -\nPlease do spread the word!\nThere is a chapter framework in place and a welcome message for those\nthat call in.\n--Invite to WordPress Book Jog\nWe invite you to join us on a book jog to update the WordPress manual\nhosted on Floss Manuals ? The existing one is here ?\nhttp://en.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/\nWhat is a Book Jog? It builds on the concept of Book Sprint but\ndowngrades the concept somewhat (sorry about that). While a book sprint\nnormally has a real life meet up at its core and has a solid time frame\nof anything from 2-5 days typically, a book jog takes place over a\nlonger time frame and may not have a real life meeting at its core.\nFor this manual there is no real meet up, we are all geographically\ndisparate. We aim to complete it in 10 days from the 12th August - 5th\nSeptember 2011\nWe want to build on the great documentation that already exists about\nWordPress to create a manual on Floss Manuals for the following reasons:\nCreating a concise introduction to WordPress\nSome might say that there is already too much existing documentation on\nWordPress, in numerous locations. This manual will be a digest of the\nmost vital aspects of WordPress for those creating a WordPress site. We\nfeel that there is definitely a place for specialized manuals. This\nmanual is aimed at audiences who are;\n    * new to using WordPress\n    * want to improve the look of their blog and learn more about design\nin WordPresss\n    * wish to extend WordPress to make it the basis for an online community\n--Using an Open and Flexible Documentation Platform\nUnlike many manuals, Flossmanuals are written with a totally open,\ndo-what-you-want-to-it license. This gives writers the freedom to\nimprove and update the manuals as new software versions are released.\nManuals are written collaboratively inviting alterations and\nimprovements from readers and users. The most up-to date-version of the\nmanual is available in several formats, including printed book, epub,\nhtml, and open office.\nWorking towards a book is a great focus for a documentation project.\n--Helping to foster Independent Online Communities\nWe want to share our enthusiasm for WordPress as a great tool for\nsharing information, publishing all kinds of media and helping to build\nnon-corporate online communities.\nWe believe that good training and follow up support is key to maximizing\nthe involvement of people in on-line communities. With the ability to\noutput the manual as a word document anyone can print various chapters\noff as supporting handouts. You can also direct your site users to\nspecific chapters of the book online, where they will learn the tools,\nand perhaps encourage others.\n--Promoting the Open Web\nFlossmanuals has a track record of supporting projects which embrace\ncollaboration and the open web. We think that the web is best when it is\nopen source and using open standards and decentralised. We believe that\nindependently hosted websites and communities a key part of keeping the\nweb open. The WordPress system is perfectly suited to this because it is\nintuitive to use, easy to install and keep updated and is free software.\nFor more information on these aspects see the following book ? An Open Web\nhttp://en.flossmanuals.net/an-open-web/\n--Supporting this manual\nIn the past this manuals been used and supported by the following groups\nand organisations, tactical tech, transmission video network, people?s\nvoice media, aktivix and hacktionlab. They have supported the manual by\ncontributing and some by paying for transport and documentation meetings.\nYou can support this version of the manual by giving your time to help\nus write it, check it, and promote it.\nYou can do this by joining us in irc ? #booksprint of #flossmanuals in\nirc.freenode.net, saying hi, and seeing what you can do to help.\nTo contribute directly you can go here -\nhttp://booki.flossmanuals.net/wordpress/_edit/ ? You will need to log in\nor create an account.\nThere is a draft chapter framework in place and a welcome message for\nthose that call in.\nSee you there!",

Ethical\nreasons aside (which I agree with), I wasn't aware of a *requirement* to\ncomply with any accessbility regulations.\nBy the way, I'd make one addition to what you said about Section 508: it's\nnot simply the \"public-facing side of (federal?) sites\"--it's much more,\nand encompasses hardware and software. It also applies to technology that\nthe feds *buy or use*. So, my experience has been that \"compliance\" comes\ninto play when you're trying to sell something to the government. Not sure\nabout the UK environment.\nCheers,\n-james\n------------------------------\nMessage: 2\nTo: wp-docs at lists.automattic.com\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed\non 17/11/2012 03:48 James said the following:\n\u003e Lorelle, I'm an advocate of accessible sites and explaining things like\n\u003e Section 508 (and have been since there was a WWW), but--I'm unclear about\n\u003e how WordPress is required to \"comply\" with US accessibility laws or laws\n\u003e of other countries. Also, I'm not clear how WordPress currently prevents\n\u003e building accessible sites for those aiming to create them. Can you explain\n\u003e that a bit, or point me towards more information?\nWordPress itself would come under the general heading of \"CMS/Software\nRequirements\" within the anti-discrimination laws of any given country.\nCertainly in the UK, it would fall under the Disability Discrimination\nAct if it did not make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled\nusers are not unfairly disadvantaged when it came to using the software.\nMany other countries in Europe have similar - if not more stringent -\nlegal requirements. I'd imagine ADA would apply in the US.\nLegality aside, there are the ethical responsibilities to ensure that\ndisabled users can create sites as easily as possible. And there are\nquite a few disabled users who use WordPress as their CMS of choice -\nprimarily because it already offers a reasonable level of accessibility.\nBut that doesn't mean it can't be improved. We also need to teach people\nhow to get the best of the features that it offers. :-)\nAFAIIA, Section 508 only applies to the public-facing side of (federal?)\nsites. So the onus is really on the site owner but, again, I think we\nhave an ethical duty to help people create the most accessible sites\nthat they can.\nHTH\nesmi\n-- \nhttp://quirm.net\nhttp://blackwidows.co.uk\n------------------------------\n_______________________________________________\nwp-docs mailing list\nwp-docs at lists.automattic.com\nhttp://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs\nEnd of wp-docs Digest, Vol 85, Issue 9\n**************************************",

I must excuse my interpretable way of writing there based on maybe unclear readings of what was been written in IRC by nacin. I totally agree that there is no need to jump or exagerate the upcomming changes of the codex, in fact right now no official decisions have been made how the changes will actually look like. I have and already had understood that.\nAs that thread shows, the discussion of the codex is one on its own and not everybody in the core team has the same opinion about that. So everybody can see, there is no official opinion about the future of the wiki.\nBut my mail was about something totally different. It is about how and where to retrieve the database dumps of the GPL'ed wordpress codex wiki content. I'm sorry if that request just jumps into a current discussion you have on re-designing wordpress.org. I just want to remind on that, because an answer to this question has not yet been given by email.\nWith this email I'd just like to focus again on my main request because a re-start from scratch might be the best:\nI'm asking who is in charge and can provide the source data of the codex.\nPlease let me know and how you folks prefer to deliver it.\nIf all resources are currently covered with the 3.0 release, I can somehow understand, so if you can provide it after the release, that would be okay for me.\nBut please let me (and everybody else who might be interested) know how this is dealt with.\nBest regards,\nhakre\n-- \nhttp://hakre.wordpress.com/",

So, there is a need for a good definition in the Codex.\n     Is anyone else working on this?\n     Can you see any room for improvement?\n     The new page would reside at:\n     http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/Global_Variables.\n[1] http://codex.wordpress.org/User:CharlesClarkson/Global_Variables\nTIA,\nCharles Clarkson\n--\nMobile Home Investor\nFree Market Advocate\nProgrammer\nStephenville, TX\nhttp://www.clarksonenergyhomes.com/wordpress/about/\nhttp://twitter.com/CharlesClarkson\n+1 (254) 968-8328\n_______________________________________________\nwp-docs mailing list\nwp-docs@lists.automattic.com\nhttp://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs",

Who looks after my \n\u003e interest there ?\nVanity links are not comptaible with open source licenses.  The GPL \nrequires that copyright headers be maintained; that's about it in terms \nof credit.  It's about the source being free.\nThis comes up all the time with open media (as opposed to open source) \nfolks.  Open source folks have been at it for a good while and have \ntread this ground.  Advertising clauses, vanity links, and such are a no \nno.  It's about the code being free, and such links impinge freedom.  \nOpen source folks worry more about maintaining open distribution and \nkeeping the code free. Open media folks, on the other hand, are \npreoccupied with credit.  I think there was a conference recently where \nopen source and open meda folks got together to talk about these \ncultural differences.  It can sometimes be hard to get open media that \nis compatible with open source.  That's becoming a bigger problem as the \ntwo intertwine more.\n\u003e The way I see it, I'm currently on my own. We all are. \nIt's up to you to protect your interests, as with anything.\n\u003e We all have copyright over our own work, but I don't see that when I \n\u003e wrote anything that I gave my permission for someone else to look \n\u003e after my copyright interests.\nThat's what lawyers are for.  If you ever need one, hire one.  Get one \nwho knows IP really well.  I've been in court with some completely \nclueless lawyers, who were on our side, alas.\n\u003e I don't have any chance of looking after my interests though do I ?\nOf course you do.  Sue the bastards!  Enlist the various watchdog groups \nto your cause.  People successfully enforce their GPL rights all the time.\nhttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/enforcing-gpl.html\n\" As a copyright license the GPL is absolutely solid. That's why I've \nbeen able to enforce it dozens of times over nearly ten years, without \never going to court.\"\n\u003e So when I said that the FSF should be considered, I was not trying to \n\u003e do anything more than have a single enforceable point of ownership - \n\u003e something we do not currently have.\nUnderstandable, but I don't think it's particularly necessary or worth \nit.  Copyright assignment tends to drive contributors off and adds \nbureaucracy.\nThere are several good resources that cover copyright and open source.  \nI follow groklaw all the time.\nhttp://groklaw.net/\nRyan",

The list does not publish as links that you can view on a \nsite, doesn't need to be maintained by the site admin for use because \nit's automatically updated by the plugin, and doesn't need to be \nmaintained by Codex authors which is subject to errors and abuse.

Just what we needed.\n\u003e\n\u003e just a couple notes that I thought I sent a while ago, but it appears not\n\u003e to have made it through to the docs mailing list. Consider these a reminder\n\u003e for everyone.\n\u003e\n\u003e 1. WordPress has a capital P in the middle not lowercase.\n\u003e\n\u003e 2. Plugin is Plugin not plugin or plug-in.\n\u003e\n\u003e 3. Watch consistency. In the first lists you describe the Plugins directory\n\u003e as a directory and the Themes directory as a subdirectory. That implies\n\u003e they are two different things, which can add to confusion. Little things\n\u003e like this can throw someone off. Just be careful.\n\u003e\n\u003e 4. Avoid one word links. For example in a sentence with \"Use WordPress\n\u003e Hooks...\" Hooks was in a link and WordPress Hooks should have been the\n\u003e link. We do this for accessibility as well as clarity. Tiny words are\n\u003e harder to click, and in this case, WordPress Hooks is a search term (unless\n\u003e they are looking for Captain. :D ). The sentence continues with single word\n\u003e links to actions and filters, which I've pretty much left because I can't\n\u003e seem to edit it without changing the context or being redundant, so this is\n\u003e always a challenge. Be judicial and try to keep them to a minimum of two\n\u003e words.\n\u003e\n\u003e I've fixed these and tightened it up a little for passive voice but the\n\u003e core is excellent! These are just reminder nitpicks. This is fabulous.\n\u003e Thank you so much!\n\u003e\n\u003e Lorelle\n\u003e\n\u003e\nI understand why the P in WordPress is always capitalised, but what's the\nreason for capping the P in Plugin? Surely 'plugin' is a genericised term.\nYours,\n?

    "body": "Hi all,\nI wonder why the Codex is under the GPL. I know similar questions have\nbeen discussed before on this list. But, as far as I know, the issue GPL\nvs. CC has not been discussed. I also know that there are good reasons\nfor choosing the GPL, e.g. to be license-compliant with WP itself.\nAnyway, I think that a code license such as the GPL is not well-suited\nfor documentary work. (I think this is obvious enough, so I don't\nexplain it further. But of course, we can discuss this. There are also\nmany related discussions to be found on the web.)\nIn my opinion, the CC-BY-SA license is equivalent to the intention of\nthe GPL, and it's a much better, because more precise and specific\nlicense for a work such as the WP Codex.\nTherefore, I'm proposing to relicense the Codex to the CC-BY-SA. Of\ncourse, one cannot simply relicense other people's work. All\ncontributors of non-trivial content would have to agree, and the content\nof those who didn't agree, would have to be removed.\nStill, I think this is possible. Wikipedia itself had a similar problem\nwhen they realized that they are stuck with the GFDL. And as far as I\nknow, Wikimedia has been able to perform a license update, despite the\nfact that Wikipedia has *many* more contributors than the WP codex.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia#Content_and_internal_structure\nhttp://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update\nWhat do you think, especially the main contributors?\nNB: I'm not a lawyer, and although I'm quite familiar with copyright\nlegislations, I'm not at all an expert.\nBy the way, you might wonder why I'm proposing this; the reason is that\nwe are currently working on a new German documentation, and the GPL is\nvery bad to handle questions like translatabilty, or compatibility with\ndocumentary work in other legislations than the US.\nBest regards,\nAlex\n-- \nAlex G?nsche, Zirona OpenSource-Consulting\nBlogs: http://www.zirona.com/ | http://www.regularimpressions.net\n*** Want to test the shiny new release of InstantUpgrade? ***\nhttp://www.zirona.com/blog/software/instantupgrade-10-beta/",

Keep spreading the word.\nI will be putting together a small group to help put together the goals and \nobjectives for the upcoming \"WordPress Lessons Contest\", that will happen in\na month or so.  If you are interested in being a part of the team, helping \nwith the concept, screening, editing, judging, whatever, let me know here or\nvia email at lorelle@cameraontheroad.com.\nDon't forget, while these lessons are merely step-by-step conversational \narticles that point people towards the serious documentation, we still need \nplenty of documentation pages to support those Lessons.  Keep the great work\ncoming!\nLorelle \n_______________________________________________\nwp-docs mailing list\nwp-docs@lists.automattic.com\nhttp://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs",

Unless they explicity release it, someone else cannot\ncome along and publish it as thier own work. Well, they aren't supposed\nto at any rate. The problem lies in the ambiguity of the ownership of\nCodex content. It isn't clear what rights the authors have.\nPodz \u003cpodz@tamba2.org.uk\u003e wrote on 09/22/2005, 02:14:40 PM:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. This is nothing to do with me or my contributions.\nActualy, it has everything to do with you and your contributions, just\nas it has everything to do with me and my contributions. That's the\npoint of this isn't it?\n\u003e \n\u003e 2. This is everything to do with protecting the copyrights that belong \n\u003e to each and every contributor.\nWhich I'll admit, I never thought about until it was brought up. How\nmany others out there are in the same boat? And what to do about those\nthat have come and gone over time?\n\u003e \n\u003e 3. Right now, all that's rattled out - by people who have not given \n\u003e largely to Codex - is the phrase \"It's GPL\". The people who actually \n\u003e have done the work are not being consulted about their copyright. \n\u003e Doesn't that strike you as odd ?\nWhen I make a posting to a forum, to which includes code, that post\nbecomes property of the forum owners. In fact, I know of one site\n(owned by a major conglomerate) that even specifies right in their\nAcceptable USe Policy that by posting, you transfer ownership of\ncontent and copyright to the company. And that they can do what ever\nthey want with it, w/o compensation to you. In all honesty, I had\n(mistakenly it seems) assumed the same kind of deal here. I had just\nassumed that ownership was inherently transfered. Guess not.\n\u003e \n\u003e 4. This is about taking action now so that the work is protected. From\n\u003e http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html -\"be sure to find out who \n\u003e the copyright holders of the software are before reporting a violation.\" \n\u003e and yet when I start to create a page of all the copyright holders, I \n\u003e get told it is a waste of time. Please do explain WHY that is a waste of \n\u003e time given that it would be needed.\nMy only thought on this is the content that has multiple authors.\nExample, Podz, you come in and add a bunch of stuff to a page, then I\ncome in and make some changes. Who owns it now? Me, or you?\n\u003e \n\u003e 5. The Codex still does not say that copyright is retained by the \n\u003e author. It does not say what rights the author may or may not have. It \n\u003e does not say who may or may not make any judgements about copyright, \n\u003e publishing, income generation etc. Don't you think it should ? It \n\u003e doesn't matter one bit that YOU might know - it should be there in clear \n\u003e language for all to see and understand before they start typing\nI agree.\n\u003e \n\u003e 6. This is not about fame and reward AT ALL. My contributions to Codex \n\u003e are way way less than a great many people, but that does not diminish \n\u003e the fact that I have the right to express what I want on this issue nor \n\u003e does it stop me looking at the bigger picture and wondering just what is \n\u003e going on. that is not a conspiracy theory, merely that right now this \n\u003e situation is just begging to be exploited given the condition it is in.\nIt's all about closing the barn doors before the horse gets out.\n\u003e \n\u003e 7. If this thread were about code in the Hackers list I'd be able to \n\u003e feel the heat from here.\n\u003e \n\u003e 8. It's a mess. It needs sorting out and the voices that actually matter \n\u003e are those people that have contributed - and surely everyone is equal \n\u003e there ? Or are we ? And if we are not, just say so.\nI'd say we're all equal... \nAnd I'd like to know what's up too.\n-tg\n\u003e \n\u003e P.\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e wp-docs mailing list\n\u003e wp-docs@lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs",

If you are aiming to have step by step\ninstructions getting this kind of clarity can be tricky.\nPersonally, I've struggled in working on docs which are targeted at\npeople using\n- their own install\n- Wordpress.com\n- a blog on a hosted WordPress network\nFor Codex / Manual docs it should be easier, you just need to add in\ndifferent possibilities for users with different levels of access. For\nthe example you use it could be...\n\"The first thing you need to log in is a Username and Password. If you\nset up your own WordPress site then you should have them to hand. If\nsomeone else set up the site, they may have added you as a user and\nnotified you in an automatically generated email. It should have the\ntitle Your Username and Password.\"\n@Lorelle - I don't know that guy / site. I just forwarded it for info. I\nthink that this is a very interesting comparing different kinds of docs,\nwhen it comes to user focused, task based guides, it seems like often\nthe key skill is not completeness, it's the opposite, knowing what to\nleave out.\nThat's guys guide was only 28 pages long including screenshots, which\ngives a quick look at what he thought was most useful.",

    "body": "The Template Hierarchy article featured a hotlinked image added recently \nfrom ScoutPress. \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy#Visual_Overview . I have \nsome concerns over the issue of hotlinking images from the Codex:\n1. Hotlinking images is bad manners no matter who does it and why. There \nis plenty of room on the Codex storage space to add more images to the \nCodex, so why not store them there? Or should we?\n2. Hotlinking the image steals bandwidth and can take longer for pages \nto load. Why bother?\n3. It isn't pretty when the image overwhelms the page and the visitor \nhas to scroll around inside the iframe to see it. And due to its size, \nscroll a long ways past it to get to the rest of the content. Just ughly.\nAs it stands now on that article, I've put a thumbnailed (but large \nenough to be visible) image in, replacing the huge version. My version \nhas been uploaded to the Codex. There are two links to view the full \nsize image that cause the visitor to leave the Codex in order to view \nthe image, though they could just download it from the original author's \nsite for viewing later, remaining on the Codex.\nThe decisions we need to make in order to form some policies around such \nwonderful but questionable offerings are:\n1. Should we permit hotlinked images from the Codex?\n2. How should links to offsite viewing of full size images be featured, \nadvising the reader that the link will take them off the Codex?\n3. I haven't found a way to create an automatic thumbnail with MediaWiki \nto a hotlinked offsite image file. I had to create a thumbnail and \nupload it to the Codex first. This is double effort. Anyone had any \nsuccess in this?\n4. What other technical and \"moral\" aspects do we need to consider for \nincluding a hotlinked image or offsite content in the WordPress Codex?\nOpinions? Advice?\n-- \nLorelle VanFossen\nOn the Road\nTaking Your Camera on the Road - http://www.cameraontheroad.com/\nFamily History Blog - http://www.cameraontheroad.com/family\nLorelle on WordPress - http://lorelle.wordpress.com/",

    "body": "This is the followup to Lorelle's email to the list, and it's something \nwe've discussed between us.\nThe goal:\n- for WP users to be able to download those parts of Codex that they \nwish to read offline.\n- for this project to be maintained in such a way as to not be dependent \non any one person or any single location (outside of wp.org)\nThe plan:\n1. Recruit a team for pdf document maintenance. A minimum of 2, \npreferably 4, people are needed.\n- each person takes on a designated range of Codex pages\n- The Codex page range would be by TOC section, such as WordPress \nLessons, Development Documentation, About WordPress, etc.\n2. Each person would monitor the documents within their section and when \nchanges are made, they will create a new PDF file.\n3. The PDF file will be uploaded to the agreed upon web space.\n- Podz will provide this. It will probably be ISP space as this is html\nonly (no code support). Other web space may be considered.

So, he sees a different site layout than most of the \nrest of us are looking at.\nThis was quickly noticed and handled by mrmist, and that should have \nbeen the end of the confusion.\nBen,\nJacob may have been quick to call you a troll, but you have been very \nvocal, extremely rude, and quick to judgment yourself when it was you \nwho made the mistaken assumption (that you too would see the changes \neven though you are using a non-default skin). Rather than trying to \nfigure out why seemingly everyone else couldn't understand what you were \ntalking about, you proceeded to believe that everyone was an idiot, that \nopen source projects are a tragedy, and that you are being crapped on. A \nwisdom I learned a while back applies here: If it seems like everyone \naround me is horribly wrong, it's more likely that I've misunderstood \nsomething and that I'm actually the one that is wrong. This wisdom is \nextremely valuable in the technical field.\nJust so you know what we are seeing, this is what I see while using the \ndefault skin: http://tinyurl.com/7ev65h\nAs you can see, the changes that everyone have been talking about are on \nthis skin and not on your's. If you wish to continue discussing changes \nto the Codex layout, I recommend that you change your skin to default.\nEveryone,\nFrankly, I think that this could have been handled better by everyone. \nMost of the response I've seen in this thread have been laced with \nassumptions and incomplete thoughts. Even if you know 100% that people \nknow exactly what you are talking about, it always helps to provide a \nlink to the page that is being discussed. It also helps to note whether \nor not your are logged in and if you see any differences when you are \nlogged in or not logged in. Using full, detailed sentences for both \nquestions and responses helps cut off spiraling circles of confusion \nlike this.\nScreenshots are a great tool. I think if Ben had been provided with a \nscreenshot of what we see earlier that this mess could have been much \nsmaller. So maybe another good practice is to always send a link to a \nscreenshot if the discussion is about site layout/design issues.\nI'm not sure that this is relevant to this thread, but in general, the \nfollowing is also good practice to prevent confusion: Keep in mind that \nwhile English is the language used on this list, not everyone is from \nthe same region/country/part of the world that you are. English is very \ndiverse, as such, using abundant detail to describe things can help \npeople that have a different usage of English or use English as a \nsecondary language.\nChris Jean\nhttp://gaarai.com/\nhttp://wp-roadmap.com/\nBernard D.

The Support Forum volunteer mailing list took off and there have been \nextensive discussions on how to \"do\" things on the Forum. Discussions of \npolicies, protections, dealing with spammers, and so on have been \ndiscussed and we need someone from that group to help write up some of \nthese for....posterity to the Codex. I understand that rules and regs \nare something unpopular here, but think of them as guidelines for the \nForum. Discussion archives are at \nhttp://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-forums/\n2. On a similar vein, http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies was \nstarted and need expansion, fixing, editing, condensing, and legal \nreview. Anyone interested? There are also some other policy, copyright \nand such pages that need some legalese review and fixing, which should \nbe listed on the Task List.\n3. Podz implemented an interesting addition to the Codex by providing \nPDF versions of the articles. They are available at \nhttp://www.zen77857.zen.co.uk/docs/ and an example of one of the \"looks\" \nwe may use on the Codex to highlight access to these documents may be \nfound at http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Podz. Podz is working on a plan \non how to include these in the Codex and he will need volunteers to help \nkeep these maintained. Please contact him as soon as possible to help \nwith this neat new feature.\n4. Screencasts were discussed earlier this year and are still desired \nfor inclusion in the Codex. If you are still interested in participating \nand volunteering your time towards such inclusion, see \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Screencasts and leave a note on the \ndiscussion page. We will start putting a team together on this very soon.\n5. Now that the Codex is back and running, if you were working on any \narticles, please complete them and/or let us know the status. We'd like \nto get these cleaned up and finished and into the main documentation as \nsoon as possible.\n6. There is still a lot to do on the Codex, so check out the \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks list and dig in.\n7. Merger of Forum and Codex - The merger of the Forum and Codex \ncontinues. Linking in the Forum is now available with the same mediawiki \nfeature of using [[WordPress Lessons]] to link to documents instead of \nthe full URL. Not all links work such as [[Site Architecture 1.5]] and \nmore work needs to be done to identify which work and which won't, and \nthe Forums team is working on that. The docs team needs to be aware of \nthese \"irregularities\" and take them into consideration when naming \narticles. The merger will basically put Codex \"on the map\" via the DOCS \nlink at the top of the wordpress.org menu. The Codex will \"look\" like \nthe wordpress.org layout, except that all of that will be changing from \nits current look to probably match the new logo. The table of contents \nwill be changing to reflect a more \"manual\" approach and we'll let you \nknow what is happening with that when we know more ourselves.\n8. WordPressMU and wordpress.com - WordPressMU runs wordpress.com which \nruns on 1.6 ALPHA-DO-NOT-INSTALL. This means that it is a constantly \nchanging look and feature version. Documentation on MU will soon be \navailable on the http://mu.wordpress.org site and also in the Codex. For \nthe most part, it will include installation and troubleshooting \ninstallations, and then an article section for users, which should be \nvery small since the actual control over a WordPressMU site for users is \nfairly limited to admin panels and content.\nA summary article has been started at \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/WordPressMU. I've written a series of \narticles that will help understand some of what is involved and \ndifferent between the two versions of WordPress. Some of these will be \ncleaned up and moved into the Codex. I'll list them below. For the most \npart, WordPressMU \"is\" WordPress 1.6, other than installation and host \nmaintenance. So there is a lot of overlap. Those on the docs team who \nhave wordpress.com sites can see the difference between 1.5 and 1.6 and \nshould begin to study the surface elements and think about articles that \nwill enhance or replace the Administration Panels articles for the new \nlook and features.\nFor now, other than the current summary and a few articles on using the \nadmin panels, designing Themes for WordPressMU (will be posted within a \nfew days), and articles such as the needs-editing \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lorelle/Customizing_The_Content as this \nis the most control MU users will have over their site.\nCAUTION: Remember, 1.6 Alpha is changing constantly and currently is in \na lot of transition - to say it nicely. Avoid screenshots or extensive \n\"conclusions\" as they might be different tomorrow. Still, we need to \nstart on the documentation, so start thinking about it.\nHere are some articles discussing the differences and related documentation:\nhttp://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/08/22/what-can-you-do-with-wordpresscom/\nhttp://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/08/30/getting-help-with-wordpresscom/\nhttp://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/08/26/attention-wordpress-theme-designers-designing-themes-for-wordpressmu/\nhttp://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/08/27/wordpress-versions-how-many-and-whats-the-diff/\nhttp://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/08/24/growing-up-with-wordpress/\nComing Soon:\nhttp://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/08/the-latest-news-on-wordpress-16-status-and-development/\nhttp://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/11/adding-technorati-tags-to-wordpressmu-sites/\nIf you are interested in writing about 1.6 and MU, please let us know so \nwe can put a good team together for the first documents. Soon, we will \nneed extensive documentation on features and plugins related to 1.6 and \nmore development and advanced level docs, so we need some lists, ideas, \nand brainstorming on what is needed and who is willing to do it.\n9. The next couple of months will be really busy for the Forum and \nCodex. With wordpress.com and other WordPressMU sites popping up as part \nof the fanfare, people have already started coming to the Forum and \nCodex for help. For the most part, the help they need is there. The \nForum software is being upgraded and improved with many volunteer \nrequested changes, and the Codex is slowly starting to improve, too. \nThere is now a TOC menu of the main areas of interest in the sidebar.\nThere is an extensive list of requested changes, fixes, and improvements \nat http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:State_of_Codex that hopefully will \nget attention and action soon. The search for the Codex is now driven by \nYahoo, and the Codex is now hosted by Yahoo, which saves on cost and \nwear and tear. There are a lot of requests to add improved functionality \nto the search capabilities, such as options to limit the search to Forum \nor Codex, and we hope they will be implemented soon. If you have \nsuggestions, please share them.\n10. Thanks again to everyone who hung in there during the recent \nproblems with the Codex. Everything seems to be back working and we need \nto get to work again and updating and adding new documentation. Thanks \nfor all your efforts and patience.\nLorelle and the mysterious \"we\" of the documentation team who fed me all \nof this information to summarize. ;-)",

Be sure and let him know if you get any strange \nerrors or bugs that need resolving, but so far, from the few minutes of \npounding away at the Codex, it looks like it's back and pretty stable. \nThanks!!!\nI have left a HUGE list of things that have needed doing with Schulte \nand he may be asking you all for your help while we hit the road again \nrunning from natural disasters in the making. Be nice when he asks, if \nhe asks, for your help and help him by asking what you can do to help \nshare the load and get these little things done and cleaned up.\nAlso, if you have signed up for any task on the \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks List make sure you let him, \nMichaelH, or me know the status of your article(s) or post them in your \nuser area so we can get these out and into the public eye. If you have \nan article in your user section that is ready to be released, edited or \nreviewed, please let us know so we can get to work on it.\nFiras, Masquerade and others were working on a listing of all the \nfunctions in WordPress as well as all the hooks for Plugins. Please \ncheck with them if you would like to help on this project. It's very \nintensive and exciting, but it requires a lot of labor, too.\nThere are still folks hanging out in #wordpress-docs IRC channel who are \nthere to help you if you need advice or information on helping the \nCodex, so please, take advantage of them - they are waiting for you. \nIt's been rather dull lately, and we need to shake the dust off.\nThank you to everyone for being so patient and hanging in during this \nbig move. There are more changes in store, I'm sure, so I think it's a \ngood idea to get as much work done as possible so when the big move to \nmerge the forum and Codex together, we're ready for it.\nI'll let you all know when we head out and when we're back.

Matt handles requests sent in via the Foundation site \npersonally, but I can usually give a general answer on things. I didn't \nsee your original request, but is there a reason you wouldn't just start \ndevelopment of a GPL tool using the existing plugin svn or on github if \nyou wanted to make collaboration easier? If it's not a WordPress-based \nsystem, then we probably wouldn't really go that route.\nI think the best thing to do is to get involved with the group actively \nworking on improving wordpress.org free/GPL support materials, at \nhttp://make.wordpress.org/support. I don't see us starting a separate \ndocumentation/training site effort, but the team working together there \n(with Mika at its head) can tell you the best ways to contribute.\nFeel free to contact me off list if you have further questions.\nThanks,\nJane\nP.S.

        "body": "The article is very good and covers some points really well. I like the\ngeneral flow.\nHowever, this duplicates articles already in the Codex. I like the idea of a\nQuick Start Guide, but it needs to be that: a quick reference guide.\nFollowing the Codex guidelines is critical, and there are some things that\nneed to be fixed in accordance with those guidelines. Please review them and\ncorrect the article accordingly.\nPrimarily, the article needs to get to the point fast, keeping\npoint-by-point steps short and sweet. There is a lot of editorial content,\nwhich is fine for explaining WordPress to a non-WordPress audience, but by\nthe time people get to the Codex, they have already made some decisions and\nhave information including the decision to go self-hosted or not. They are\non the WordPress Codex, so they do not need to be told that the Codex is a a\nwiki manual. :D\nBy calling it a Quick Start Guide, it needs to be QUICK. Step by step and\npoint by point. We have a variety of articles that take users through the\nprocess with more explanations, and this article duplicates much of that\nwork. I'd link to those as a lead in for more information and get right to\nthe quick in the start part.\nI recommend that the article be shortened to the key points so someone can\ngo through and check off the list of each of the steps. Also, until we can\nget the designer to remove the third, unnecessary sidebar, the table of\ncontents squishes everything over, so please keep the section titles short.\nIt's a great start and I look forward to watching it evolve into a valuable\naddition to the Codex. I'll let you whack away at it first before we send\nthe troops in. :D Good work and thank you so much!\nLorelle\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/attachments/20080429/57fcba97/attachment.htm",

Or are you going to \nthoroughly purge the site of all help for old versions every time a new \nversion is released?\nIf the answer to both those questions is \"no\", then eventually you will \nhave to start including version-specific sections in some pages, and an \n\"Applies to:\" list of version numbers at the start of most others. If \nyou don't, then in a few years, someone reading a page written in the \nWordPress 1.6 era will have no way of telling whether its instructions \nare still valid for Wordpress 3.0, or whether it's just that no-one has \nhad time to update/delete it.\nSo I suggest adding version-specific sections to pages, if you feel \nlike writing such sections (even if the WordPress 1.2 section says only \n\"The easiest way to solve this problem is to upgrade to WordPress \n1.5\"), or if the old information is written already.\nIf you don't feel like adding such sections, I suggest adding an \n\"Applies to:\" section to the top the page, containing a bulleted list \nof applicable versions. If the page no longer applies to Wordpress 1.5, \nthen add a \"Does not apply to:\" section containing the single item \"* \nWordPress 1.5 or later\". Then when each new version of Wordpress is \nreleased, I can see by looking at those two lists whether a page is (a) \napplicable, (b) not applicable, or (c) not updated yet.\n-- \nMatthew Thomas\nhttp://mpt.net.nz/",

Sysadmins and Bureaucrats should be able to move in pages as and\n\u003e when they like, without having to check back and forth for speedier\n\u003e development.\n\u003e 2.

Don't frustrate doc\n\u003e writers (MDAWaffe comes to mind, among others :) )\n\u003e\n\u003e Suggested Standards for Sysops, bureaucrats creating new pages:\n\u003e 1. Titles are in Title Case, so \"Using the Link Manager\" is used, not\n\u003e \"Using the link manager\". (we need exactly one method, and this method\n\u003e is already in vogue.)\n\u003e 2. Titles are action or task oriented whenever possible.\n\u003e 3. A new page should be relatively complete, containing useful\n\u003e information that is immediately useful to the end user. No blank new\n\u003e pages.\n\u003e 4. A new page should always be linked-to from some other page(s). No\n\u003e bastard pages.\n\u003e 5. Titles shall not have leading or trailing spaces.\n\u003e 7. In case of doubt regarding the suitability of a name, mail the\n\u003e wp-docs list asking for suggestions. Suggestions should be received in\n\u003e less than two days. Hold your peace after two days :)\n\u003e 8. The page creator's title suggestion should be used as long as it is\n\u003e sensible and does not violate any rules given here.\n\u003e 9. Shorter titles are better.\n\u003e 10. Avoid prepositions in Titles.\n\u003e\n\u003e Exception:\n\u003e Sub-pages are created after discussion, always.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have an opinion regarding these practices, voice them now,\n\u003e within 5 days. Improve the rules above. Decision making threads like\n\u003e this one should have a resolution, summarized in a mail to the thread,\n\u003e at the end of 5 days (which is yet another proposal), unless there is\n\u003e some special circumstance, which neccessitates extended discussion.\n\u003e\n\u003e Carthik.\n\u003e\n\u003e -- \n\u003e When nothing is done, nothing is left undone -- ??

Thank you muches.\nNow that I've returned back to my home-not-home of Mobile, where the \ndamage for the most part was minimal, I find that another hurricane hit \nthe Codex.  I've posted other resources and how to access the Codex via \nGoogle Cache, but I would like to put a plan together that includes \nreleasing such information on the Forum and how to handle this in the \nfuture.\nHere is my general outline and please add and let's (eventually) put \nthis on the Codex and keep it in our files when it is all put together \nso we know how to handle the next \"Codex is down\" report.\n1. Assign \"Codex Down\" representation to four people who will notify \nMatt and then alert the others of such notification so Matt isn't \noverwhelmed. Consider: Carthik, Lorelle, Skippy, Podz - but that's open \nfor debate. I think one or two others in reserve might be good, like \nWesti and....well, I hate naming names but we need some backups in case \none or more of the first four are absent on vacation or hurricane runs.\n2. Two volunteer representatives who will post a note onto the Forum \nexplaining that the Codex is down and following something similar to \nhttp://wordpress.org/support/topic/39173 - we need more and/or better \nresources. It's a mess and needs fixing.\n3. Posting to the Docs Mailing list, as Matt has just done, is \nWONDERFUL. Thank you.  We need such alerts to continue.\n4. Consider the possibility of creating mirror sites?\nNow, what else should be part of our plan for \"Codex is down\" and \ncontinuing to provide help and support to users?\nLorelle",

Seems to me that a certain \namount of pruning and maintenance comes with the territory, and it \nshould be up to the bureaucrats and sysadmins to keep duplicate content \nin check and flag pages for improving if they don't fit within the \nguidelines.\nTo draw the usual comparison, Wikipedia doesn't have a similar policy, \nand they manage quite well. Perhaps if the job is too large for the \ncurrent staff of admins, more admins should be appointed to balance the \nload, rather than implementing guidelines which, while they're \nwell-meaning, restrict the openness of the wiki platform.\nThe idea of not putting pages into production until they're finished is \na nice one in theory, but on wikis, where there is never a final draft, \nI think it serves only to deter other users from contributing to the \nunfinished pieces. Not only that, but I'm sure that hiding drafts in \nthe privacy of user pages actually contributes to duplicate \ninformation, since they have very low visibility.\nMorgan",

    "body": "Some of you may have heard Matt Mullenweg's announcement at WordCamp Las\nVegas of the WordPress Handbook, a free online manual for WordPress users. I\nchatted with him about the future of WordPress documentation, the WordPress\nCodex, and this new handbook.\nFirst, the WordPress Handbook is NOT a replacement for the Codex. The\nhandbook will be the essence of a basic manual for using WordPress. The\nCodex may actually expand to cover everything outside of the core essentials\nfor using WordPress. For now, it will continue to be the source of\ninformation for developers and core functions.\nThe WordPress Handbook will begin with a very basic \"How to Use WordPress\"\ncore that guides the user through installation, upgrades, and basic user\nfunctions like how to write a post, upload images, embed multimedia, install\nPlugins and Themes, and the core functionality of using WordPress. Much of\nit will use Codex content regarding those tasks and the WordPress\nAdministration Panels.\nA \"design and customization\" version will include tips on choosing a\nWordPress Theme and Plugin, installing, customizing and tweaking.\nA developer version will follow to help Theme and Plugin authors and third\nparty apps to hook into WordPress to add features and functionality.\nThe WordPress Handbooks will not be in wiki form. They will be created using\nSubversion. An example is the http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ Version Control\nwith Subversion by Ben Collins-Sussman, Brian W. Fitzpatrick, C. Michael\nPilato.\nThe handbook will be in XML form tied to Subversion (SVN), allowing easy\nupdating for version specific issues within the documentation, linking to\nthe online handbook directly from WordPress based upon version, branching\ninto version specific guides. It will also include options for HTML and PDF\nversions, and the ability to submit patches and updates just as is currently\nbeing done with WordPress and many other programs. The idea is to keep the\nhandbook updated and current with the latest version of WordPress, as well\nas past versions, while continuing to allow community participation and\n\"proofing\" for checks and balances in the documentation.\nThe WordPress Handbook will continue to follow in the footsteps of its\npredecessors as an open source project under the GPL. Some staff may be\nhired or given responsibility to implement and oversee the project, but it\nwill be community driven, allowing anyone to submit changes and additions\nthrough the Subversion repository.\nMatt is working on the fundamental programming and process for which to\nstart integrating appropriate Codex and original WordPress 2.7 specific\ncontent into the handbook. We'll be calling upon the WordPress Codex\ndocumentation team to help us update and choose what information \"must\" be\nin the handbooks, as well as updating the Codex. Calls will be put out to\nthe WordPress Community for recommendations on content and topics as well,\nletting their needs guide the final choices.\nThe handbooks must service basic beginners to intermediate users, which\nmeans the Codex may become the historical repository and technical guide\nbeyond the handbook. The writing style will be different from the Codex in\nkeeping with a basic manual rather than a guide.\nThe Handbook will be a major shift for those used to the Codex and Mediawiki\nwho wish to contribute, especially for those with no experience with\nSubversion. We'll be writing up guidelines and tips for submitting content\nand patches, as well as a style guide, on the Codex.\nHere are some links to help you familiarize yourself with how Subversion,\nand the example of the free online Subversion book, works:\nhttp://svnbook.red-bean.com/ Version Control with Subversion by Ben\nCollins-Sussman, Brian W. Fitzpatrick, C. Michael Pilato\nhttp://www.open.collab.net/community/subversion/svnbook/ - Open Collab.net\nversion of the SVN book\nhttp://www.open.collab.net/community/subversion/svnbook/svn.preface.organization.htmlOpen\nCollab.net version of the organizational structure of the SVN book and\nhow to use Subversion\nhttp://code.google.com/p/svnbook/issues/list\nhttp://svn.red-bean.com/svnbook/trunk/\nhttp://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596004484/ - the printed book\nhttp://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html - using subversion\nhttp://osdir.com/ml/version-control.subversion.book/ - mailing list for the\nVersion Control Subversion book\nIf you have any links on the step-by-step process of using Subversion as a\nmanual or book, please let us know.\nAgain, this is not the end of the WordPress Codex. This is an exciting shift\nfor WordPress documentation. This is the start of a conversation about where\nthe Codex is going, and what key content should be in the handbook. We'll\nhave information on the technical process soon.\nFor now, we need to start work updating the Codex for WordPress 2.7,\nincluding adding new screenshots, screencasts, incorporating the technical,\nhow-to videos from WordPress.tv, creating our own short, technical videos,\nand continuing the tremendous work of so many volunteers within the\nWordPress Community to offer technical and reference material to WordPress\nusers.\nLorelle VanFossen\nTwitter: lorelleonwp\nEmail: lorelleonwordpress at gmail.com\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/attachments/20090120/93b55da6/attachment-0001.htm",

Calls will be put out to the WordPress Community for recommendations on content and topics as well, letting their needs guide the final choices.\n\u003e\n\u003e The handbooks must service basic beginners to intermediate users, which means the Codex may become the historical repository and technical guide beyond the handbook. The writing style will be different from the Codex in keeping with a basic manual rather than a guide.\n\u003e\n\u003e The Handbook will be a major shift for those used to the Codex and Mediawiki who wish to contribute, especially for those with no experience with Subversion. We'll be writing up guidelines and tips for submitting content and patches, as well as a style guide, on the Codex.\n\u003e\n\u003e Here are some links to help you familiarize yourself with how Subversion, and the example of the free online Subversion book, works:\n\u003e\n\u003e http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ Version Control with Subversion by Ben Collins-Sussman, Brian W. Fitzpatrick, C.

This is an exciting shift for WordPress documentation. This is the start of a conversation about where the Codex is going, and what key content should be in the handbook. We'll have information on the technical process soon.\n\u003e\n\u003e For now, we need to start work updating the Codex for WordPress 2.7, including adding new screenshots, screencasts, incorporating the technical, how-to videos from WordPress.tv, creating our own short, technical videos, and continuing the tremendous work of so many volunteers within the WordPress Community to offer technical and reference material to WordPress users.\n\u003e\n\u003e Lorelle VanFossen\n\u003e Twitter: lorelleonwp\n\u003e Email: lorelleonwordpress at gmail.com\n\u003e\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e wp-docs mailing list\n\u003e wp-docs@lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs\n\u003e\n--\nTai\nhttp://tekapo.com",

An example is the http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ Version Control\n\u003e with Subversion by Ben Collins-Sussman, Brian W. Fitzpatrick, C. Michael\n\u003e Pilato.\nI'm trying to understand the problems that will be solved by creating\na Subversion-controlled manual.  The practical realities that make\nSubversion such a helpful tool for software development are either not\npresent or already addressed with a wiki.  So for example, if the\nCodex were overwhelmed by ideologues trying to reshape the Codex, or\nif vandalism were a constant problem, then I could understand\ntightening up control.\nIf the issue is a matter having professionals generate the content,\nwhy not unleash those professional writers on the Codex?  The Codex\nquality will improve all around, as you'd be combining the work of the\npaid writers and volunteers who for the most part seem to know their\nstuff.\n\u003e The writing style will be different from the Codex in keeping with a basic manual rather than a guide.\nIn practice the distinction between a \"manual\" and a \"guide\" is a very\nfine line, one crossed in many places already in the Codex.  If that\ndistinction is the main issue, why not just supplement the Codex with\na \"manual\" section?\nI'm concerned that this manual will have the effect of undermining the\nperceived value of the Codex, which will mean fewer people will\nconsult it, and fewer volunteers will contribute both to the Codex and\nto the manual (with its higher barrier of entry).  Of course,\npotential deficits like that might be worthwhile in light of the\noverall benefit, but I'm having difficulty seeing the benefit.\n\u003e Cool Cool Cool.\n\u003e\n\u003e Doing it in the style of the subversion book is going to be real cool.\n\u003e\n\u003e I am looking forward to contributing.\nWhy is it more fun to contribute using Subversion than a wiki?",

    "body": "Whew!  The week is half over and the Cleanup Team wanted me to give you \nall a status report on the activities so far. The following information \nis \"of the moment\" since momentum is picking up and we can barely keep \ntrack of it all.\n* Tasks List\n Arbitrary New articles (brand new, not revised and fixed): 15\n Arbitrary Tasks Completed (new tasks, not ongoing efforts): 13\n  We call these arbitrary because they are the ones \"caught\" and\n  recorded. There is a lot going on very fast here and the cleanup\n  team is working hard to keep up, let alone count it all.\n* Since Wednesday, June 15, several days before the start of the cleanup \nweek, people were already starting to pitch in.  While exact numbers are \nhard to estimate, it looks like about 2000 changes have been made to the \nCodex since then, maybe more. Will probably be about double that by the \nmiddle of next week.  A lot of cleaning by the cleanup team will happen \nnext week to clean up from the weekend.\n* While 19 people \"officially\" signed up, many more signed up for \nspecific tasks and made offers of help via the IRC Chat #wordpress-docs.\n* The Task list has been cleaned up to only show the lists of items \nawaiting activity and signup at http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks.  \nThe accomplished tasks have been moved to the discussion page: \nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/Codex_talk:Tasks\n*Especially important has been the list of new articles submitted to Codex\nincluding these contributions with more on the way:\nAccessibility\nAdd Link SubPanel\nAdding Asides\nAdministration Panels in Plugins\nAlphabetizing Posts\nBlog by Email\nHardening WordPress\nMoving WordPress\nUsing Javascript in WordPress\nColoured Quicktags\nCreating Admin Themes\nHTML to XHTML\nStyling for Print\nUsing Gravatars\nWordPress Cookies\nLink Manager - complete rewrite and revision\n* While everyone on the Cleanup team has worked hard on this, special \nrecognition needs to be given to the \"categorizing team\" who categorized \nEVERY one of the more than 400 articles on the Codex. The categories are \ncoordinated with the main table of contents and listed at the bottom of \nevery page. This will help increase the connection between related \ndocuments and improve user friendliness in the Codex. It is a huge, \nboring task and kudos to them for plowing through it all.\nSummary\nAs it stands now, the Codex Cleanup Week has been a resounding success. \nMany goals set for this project have been accomplished:\n* Increased awareness of the WordPress Codex as a resource\n* Improvement of the reputation of the WordPress Codex as a valued resource\n* Increased connection between the Forum and the Codex\n* Increased volunteer activity on the Codex\n* Increased documentation\n* Improved checking and verification of documents from a \"team\" and not \nan individual resulting in documents released faster and better quality \nassurance\n* Improved communication\n* Development of a task list for directing volunteer efforts\nAgain, thanks to everyone.  We are just at the half way mark and there \nis plenty more to do.  Get out your brooms and dust pans and start \ncleaning up the Codex with us.\nLorelle and the whole Codex Cleanup Team",

( Or maybe i couldnt find )\nCodex dont have any API explanation or something for backbone.js and sadly\nall old filters/actions are just not supporting in wp3.5\nlike attachment_fields_to_edit (didnt try adding new field. just tried to\nremove default ones)\nAn example:\nhttp://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/87677/wp3-5-media-gallery-edit-modal-change-captions-to-title\nThis question was normally simple with old panel but its nearly impossible\nfor me at the moment.\nCan we get some codex updates about new media panel?\n_______________________________________________\nwp-hackers mailing list\nwp-hackers at lists.automattic.com\nhttp://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-hackers\n-- \n-- I've kinda got a thing for WordPress \u003e http://www.drewapicture.com\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-docs/attachments/20130223/ec4990db/attachment.htm\u003e",

    "body": "Looks good to me. I hope others will add their opinions.\nWe have a little bit of clarification on WordPress Themes. WordPress Themes come\nin two flavors of technical support: helping those who know not what they do but\nwant to do it anyway, and building your own Theme.\nThe WordPress Lessons and Blog Design sections cover the first group fairly well,\nthough new material dedicated to them is always welcome. However, a section on\nWordPress Theme Development dedicated specifically to those who want to develop\nThemes for public release is great to expand upon under the Development section.\nI'm totally thrilled with the Plugin and Theme distribution articles. I've been\nbegging for those for quite some time. Those definitely fit under Development.\nHow does that sound? \nI have plans to update the whole table of contents, so don't get too focused on\nthat as much as filling in the blanks as you've listed them.

I'm on the team that believes that a new manual doesn't have\nto be written for every version.
