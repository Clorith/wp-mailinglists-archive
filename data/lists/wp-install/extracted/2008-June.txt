Hi,
I suppose this is mainly for Michael and Jeremy. I don't know who's active any more.
I received an enquiry for a new installer. I don't know if you guys even think we need one, but here is all the info I have if you want to pursue it further.
Enquiry:

Hi Sam :)

::waves to Michael and Jeremy::

I'm still "active" as in, I still want to do this - but I'm sort of  
"on hold" because things got way busy for me.  (Like I said before, if  
you all want me to *not* be part of it anymore, then I totally  
understand!)  But if you need me to help, I'm totally there - just  
shoot me a big fat HELP ME! message and I'll do what I can.

Just wanted to say that :)  And I'm all for whatever you all decide to  
do :)

~Shelly
