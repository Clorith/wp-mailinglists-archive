Subject: [Wp-install] Need WP installed on site
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=CMqES7pjHopycpOoyusa_2P1fsvzaA83x0fq8@mail.gmail.com>

Hey there

I need WordPress installed on my website and have been trying to do it
myself for two weeks but keep running into roadblocks. I seem to have all
the correct information in place, but at this point I don't want to look at
another editing screen....

So if someone wants to help, I can pay (as long as there is a secure way to
do it) for your service.

Have a good day

Alex
