I have the username and password to log into the install4free blog.
What else do I need to know?  presumably there's a process of some sort in

While in there (Blog's Control Panel)  Go to => Manage => Awaiting Moderation 128 / Moderation Queue

Then, scroll to the bottom of page to find the latest comments that haven't been "marked" by another installer. You'll see through other comments how things are done..  When you find a "request" that you wanna handle, EDIT it and add something like this to it, wrap it <strong> </strong> tags..

<strong>HandySolo comments - HandySolo has contacted user and is awaiting response - UTC 2006-09-21 8:29:00 pm</strong>

Save edit, grab that user's email address, send them the following type of email to them:

To remove the "unanswered" install requests, in the moderation queue, what you all think? 

With the on going new requests these past few days, weeks..with the "promotion" of the Install4free service, in the Codex, and the sticky thread of mine, made in the Installation forum... I think it's time to get rid of ones like this below here:

"MichaelH comments: MichaelH has contacted user and is awaiting response from the user UTC 2006-07-15 2:18:09 pm .

Jul 15, 10:07 AM"

IMHO, I think "they" are just cluttering up the moderation queue page, not to mention load times for those with Dial up connections. Well, I mean just me.. =P 

Also, who else wants to be OFF the "Installers list"? One has already mentioned to me, that they no longer felt they could be available to help install for people, they had also asked to be off the "installers list". In which, the day after getting that email, I had removed them from the list.

IMO, there is a few others that *could be* removed from the list, since we had no word from them, in how long, haven't seen anyone else in the moderation queue doing installs, except for, MichaelH, Doodlebee, Samboll, and I.. 

I already know where HandySolo stands on this, so..it only leaves the other few there...
http://install4free.wordpress.com/?page_id=10

I know "paid gigs" get in the way of things, and I know "life and offline jobs" also do the same, just was throwing out the question, just to be sure.. ;) 

With that said, who thinks "we" could bring aboard *other* installers, to "replace" those that haven't been installing, or chooses to be off the "installers list"? Or, do you "feel" with the current installers, that we are pretty well set?

I noticed MichaelH, and Doodlebee have been really active lately, knocking out tons of installs, almost as if "they" were in competition with each other lmao!! =P Anyway, sometimes I just feel like why bother anymore.. I dunno why I think that, but.. just do.. =( 

All the "requests" I've been handling lately, are, sad to say.. pain in the arses. Either they are setup on Windows servers, don't have ALL their information as asked for, don't have their informations correct at all, don't databases setup on their accounts, don't have indexs setup on their accounts, delete ALL the WP files that I did already upload, only to use the Fantastico option in the CPanel anyways..

Alot of the install requests that I had lately, are almost done within weeks worth of time, or so, because of the above following problems..  I know it's not going to be "cake" all the time, just saying.. 

I dunno, sometimes I even feel like hanging up my hat, and moving onto something else.. =( Anyway, please let me know what ya'll think.. I'm out for now.. later..

I am so with you spencer - please nuke some of the unanswered because 
it's a pain going through all that.

Also, don't get down about the folks that don't have a clue - that's why 
they're coming to us. None of it's life and death. :>)

>I am so with you spencer - please nuke some of the >unanswered because it's a pain going through all that.

Thanks for agreeing with me Samboll. =)  I have just done a few more now, but.. I'm not sure how far back to go? Should we leave those from the beginning of Aug?  I really don't like deleting other people's requests... /meaning..I don't like removing those that MichaelH, Samboll and whoever was attempting to handle, because only those people know what's going on via email with their "clients".. =)  

I'd hate to remove a few of your's from the beginning of Aug, Samboll, only to find out later, that they might have finally gotten back to you, then you have no where to update "us" on what happened.. sigh. 

Like, with some of my recent ones.. I'm still in contact with them, they just having host problems.. so, if someone deletes the "un-updated requests" of mine, then I wouldn't have a place to fill in my "updated" status with that client.. Well, I even have contact with some of the "older/un-updated" requests too, just..they not getting back to me right away.. sigh.. Dang hosts.. [rolls eyes].. What ya all think on that then? What dates can "we" go back too?


>Also, don't get down about the folks that don't have a clue - >hat's why they're coming to us. None of it's life and death. :>)
>Samuel samboll Bollinger

Yeah, hehe.. I understand. I don't think it's "them" that's bothering me though.. I think I'm allowing personal issues to ruin my "work/job" performances.. sigh.. Which I shouldn't be doing to start with.. but.. 

1) I lost ALL of the previous people's installation/backups from before, because two Sundays ago, my hard drive crashed.. and I lost *everything* sigh.. =(

2) I finally got to see a *picture* of my Third son, which I have seen person to person yet, since he was born the beginning of July.. because the EX-Mental GF is being a Bit&$ about everything sigh.. =(  

I dunno....well, yeah I do know.. life just sucks.. period. =(

I'd say delete all "unanswered" requests from the July 17 to September 15.
Then at the end of each month, delete those "unanswereds" up to the 15th of
that month.   I suggest each person that originally claimed an install
should go back and delete those requests where the requestor never bother to
respond to our solicitation.  Please keep track of how many you delete and
report that to the list so we can have a rough idea of the number of
requests we have received, versus the number we've actually completed.

The names on the list are people who volunteered for the project originally.
Unless they ask to be removed, assume their silence means they wish to
remain on the list.

I guess after reading "the call to arms" email
(http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-forums/2006-September/003410.html)
I have to plead guilty to being over-aggressive with the installations--if I
see a request I pounce on it.  But, I don't want to discourage others from
participating, so in that vain, I will wait at least one hour before
responding to any 'open' request.

Your question and comment are somewhat opposing.  On the one hand, do we
need new blood to help with installs, but on the other hand current
installers aren't getting enough work.  This is a damned if you do, damned
if you don't, situation.  For now, let's see if we get behind in fulfilling
the requests and if we do, make a call for help.

> All the "requests" I've been handling lately, are, sad to say.. pain in

Just the nature of the game I suppose.  I've added a statement to
https://install4free.wordpress.com/2006/06/25/get-in-touch/ asking that
requesting individuals insure they have the proper server requirements.
But, it is real apparent that many people just don't read...

Spencer, on a personal note, please remember this is supposed to be fun.
But on the other hand, take joy in the fact real life DOES get in the way.

Thanks for getting this moving and please know your contributions to
WordPress are valued.

Thanks for pointing that out again Michael. =)  I was going to bring it up in the last reply of mine, but forgot it.

Sounds good to me! Pretty much answers my question in the last reply also. ;) =)

Yeah, I suppose.. just would be nice to *hear from some people*, sometimes lmao! =P

Hahaha, "the call to arms" email..  Yeah, don't get me wrong though.. I *love* the fact that you're handling the installs, as well as the other *two* doodlebee and samboll.. ;) =)  You pouncing on them, don't bother me either lol! ;)  

I guess we just gotta remember "Time Zones" in general too.. I'm not sure about everyone else, but.. I'm over here in crap/boring Pennsylvania...so I usually handle some from 12 midnight.. to the early mornings.. But, it also doesn't really bother me, that you're pouncing on the install requests.. because I'm *busy as hell* here, trying to get back everything I lost when my hard drive crashed sigh.. =(

Yeah, I'm sorry for making it sound that way.. And I agree,.. with the current installers.. "we" seem to be handling them fine.. so, if things start to go/get crazy for "us" lol, we could cry for help. =)

NOTE:  remember you can't just reply to emails on this list as the reply
goes to the originating person--you have to manually address the reply to
wp-install@lists.automattic.com

This is a heads-up about a problem caused by deleting comments.  Let's say
you delete comment #100.  At that time all comments from 101 to the highest
comment get renumbered.  No problem there.

But when a new comment (a new request for installation) is made, that new
comment may get 'inserted' back as comment 100 and the other comments from
101 to the highest numbered comment will get renumbered again.

Currently at comment 18, there is a new request that got posted after some
of the 'unfullfilled' requests were deleted.

That means that instead of looking at the end of the list of comments for
new requests, we will have to continually parse all the comments for open
requests.

Maybe we shouldn't delete comments.

Any ideas on what we should do?

I haven't completely read through everyone's replies to this one, so if 
I'm reiterating anyone else, I apologize.

I was thinking on this yesterday, and I came to the conclusion (or idea, 
really) that 1) whoever responded to a comment should be the one to 
delete it, since the responder wouldn't know what's actually going on 
(maybe things are on hold for a reason); and 2) delete all the ones that 
are hanging out up until 2 weeks ago.  Keep 'em up for 2 weeks and then 
let it go, I say.  But the original "answerer" should be responsible for 
deleting the comments they responded to, I think.

I also had another thought - could we mark the ones that are absolutely 
completed with a successful installation as "approved"?  My thought 
process is that we don't want them to be deleted because I think it's a 
good idea to know who has had experience with what servers and problems, 
so we know who to ask if there are questions.  It's also nice to have a 
record of the ones that were successful should anything come up. 
However, after a while it's gonna get bogged down like it is now with 
all of them.  So I was thinking maybe we could remove the ability for 
comments to be displayed on the site (keep the comment *form* - just 
don't display any previously made comments, or just set the comments to 
"display:none" on the website), and just approve the successful ones. 
That way, all the moderated ones are the ones we're working on, and the 
approved ones we can go through and see what solutions were to issues 
and stuff.

I also wanted to address spencer's thoughts of quitting on us.  You 
better not! LOL

I don't mind taking on what I can, but I also run my own web design 
business (as well as raising two three kids and doing my little "CSS 
help" website on the side) - I am a busy bee.  But I like to stay busy, 
which is why I agreed to help.  And I do love to help.  But there *will* 
be times when I cannot.  Right now, I'm getting into a week where I'm a 
little too busy (just had 3 projects come in yesterday morning that 
"need to be done last week" - I love clients who do that to you) to go 
through the installs like I did this past weekend.  But when I have the 
time to, I'll go for it like crazy.  But I just wanted to say that I'd 
hate for people to leave thinking that I (for one) can be counted on to 
check and attack what I see every day, because that won't happen.  It 
will when I have time to - but I'd hate to see someone else struggling 
because I had a higher priority that week.

Of course, I went into it thinking that *everyone* has a similar 
situation - sometimes there are higher priorities - which is why we have 
so many volunteers - someone to pick up the slack when people like me 
have to let go for a bit.

Okay, my little novel is over - just wanted to put my stuff out there too :)

I don't think you can mark them approved--won't they show up on the actual
web-site under the post "Get in Touch"?

Sorry, I didn't finish reading what you said, "So I was thinking maybe we
could remove the ability for
comments to be displayed on the site".

That's a good question and would require input from someone able to make
changes to the theme or maybe we can get auttomatic to give us some
"credits" so we can change the theme  ;)

Yeah, I had noticed that from waaay back.. lol! =P  I was kind of figuring, you guys had already knew of that too, that's why I didn't say anything.. 

So, earlier today.. when after I had deleted some of the "unanswered".. other requests came in, and just did a Copy/Paste of the "Sept 26" into the "Find In This Page" option, via the Firefox browser, up top, under the EDIT tab, and searched the whole page that way.. =P

Once I found it, I "claimed" it lol. I think it's going to be the *only way* of doing things, until "we" get more "rights" to work with the theme, or some means in general, to be able to do these tasks we want..

I totally agree with you. I think that will be the best thing to do, as no one else, but the "claimer" of a request, know what's going on with that "client". =)  


>and 2) delete all the ones that are hanging out up until 2 >weeks ago.  Keep 'em up for 2 weeks and then let it go, I say.  
>But the original "answerer" should be responsible for 
> deleting the comments they responded to, I think.

Yeah, well, as you said in the last part there, the two weeks time frame is cool, but.. just as long as it is the "claimer" of the request doing the deleting.. Cause, like I said two replies before.. sometimes the client's are having host issues, and their hosts don't get their accounts adjusted in a quickly manner.. sigh. I'm still dealing with a request or two, from almost a week and a half ago.. sigh. 

I just emailed back to a third one earlier today, because his FTP login informations are all wrong, and not working.. and still haven't heard back from them yet .. sigh. Anyway..yeah, this is going off topic totally sigh, sorry about that..  Agreed though, the "claimer" of an install request, should handle their own, because only they know what's going on with their "client's" lol.


<snipped down a bit..sorry doodlebee>
>I also had another thought - could we mark the ones that are >absolutely completed with a successful installation as >"approved"?  So I was thinking maybe we could remove the >ability for comments to be displayed on the site (keep the >comment *form* - just don't display any previously made >comments, or just set the comments to "display:none" on the >website), and just approve the successful ones. 

That kind of sounds like a good idea, but.. before "we" could, maybe attempt that.. for security purposes.. re-edit the comments quick, that actually contain Host/FTP/ other informations as such. So, incase something goes wrong.. their info will not be accidently displayed to the public, for any length of time, short or not.. 

Also, going along with that, maybe some how, the theme's comments.php code, could allow *only* access to those that have admin/general control panel rights to begin with.. so, the display:none;  wouldn't have to be used, they would just *not* show up to anyone, but those with the access to the backend of the blog itself? 

Not sure if the "Role Manager" plugin, or whatever, would work for this, or even some type of password protected plugin would be awesome for this, only thing is though, we would still need either Matt, Ryan, or maybe even Podz to be able to upload those plugins, and make the changes..? =/  

Even then though, we would prolly want/need the "paged comments plugin" too, so the comments are displayed as 10 per page, or so.. so we don't have the same problem as we have now, except it's on the blog's pages itself lol!!


>I also wanted to address spencer's thoughts of quitting on >us. You better not! LOL

Hehe, Well, I was seriously thinking about it earlier, and was just going to quit, and remove my name from the Installers list, just handle the last couple I had "claimed"...but figured.. nah, I'll stay.. ;) =) 

<snipped down a bit again.. >

Yeah, I understand perfectly.. ;) =)  Actually, MichaelH was the first to start handling the requests.. then, I emailed him, asking what to send to the "requesters". .and he told me what email to use.. then after I started handling some, he told me to take over, because he had projects to deal with.. which of course... then, wasn't bad at all.. Install4free wasn't promoted at all, and things were going along smoothly.. =)

Just now, with everyone's on-going projects and so forth, and Install4free was promoted.. the "requests" are going up and up and up.. and, I personally feel that the current 4 of us, installers, are doing a pretty damn good job of handling things, even though I haven't been so much lately.. because of the puter problems I had the past week or so sigh.. but, all and all.. "we" all handle things how we can, and are doing an awesome job also! Much and many praises to you guys, and I'm so glad you offered to help "us" doodlebee, and I'm so glad I brought ya aboard the "installers team" too. =) ;) 

Well, I'm tired as heck now, haven't been to bed yet... been up straight since midnight lastnight.. and it's now 6pm lol.. Me heading to bed here soon.. I'll be up then, to check on install requests and such.. ;) =)

Subject: [wp-install] Installation on Windows servers?
Message-ID: <451AA745.5040306@anekostudios.com>

Hey guys - I have 2 people here who have Windows IIS servers.  One is a 
host I've never heard of, and I can't find a Control Panel to save my life.

The other is on GoDaddy.  Both have databases set up on their servers, 
but, for both of them, when I try to run install.php, I get this error:

Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL which is required 
for WordPress.

I went into the GoDaddy one, and there most assuredly *is* a database 
set up, and he's got the correct information in his config file.

Is this a problem with IIS servers?  Would anyone know how to fix this?
(I know in the GoDaddy case, switching to *nix isn't an option)

Thanks :)

1.  Maybe in error, but I've told people they have to have a GoDaddy Linux
account.  Am I wrong?

2.  Godaddy can and will change a Windows to a Linux account (takes 4-72
hours to take affect).

First off, Wp will work generally just fine with IIS.  There are some
wrinkles though.

With GoDaddy, hit the forums.  There's some hoops to jump if they insist on
staying with IIS -- In fact, as I recall some core file edit needs to
happen.

The other might be a similar deal.  Or build ye olde little phpinfo() test
file and see if the host even has php configured correctly (by default, it's
a pita with iis).

Thanks guys - I did find the solution and it worked out on the GoDaddy 
server.

The other guy - when I tried to log into his stuff and attempt the fix 
there - apparently he gave up without saying anything.  Everything I had 
already done was completely wiped out, and he installed Pivot (doesn't 
require a database).

Kinda makes you want to email them and say "Thanks for letting me know 
*you* gave up while I've been banging my head trying to find a solution 
for you for two days.  I appreciate the heads up on that.  Next time 
I'll buy a smaller bottle of Excedrin, and maybe take some time out to 
fix my family dinner rather than worry about you."

ARGH.  Okay, it wasn't *that* bad - I *did* stop to make dinner LOL. 
But sheesh, you think they'd say something, you know?

Anyway, thanks for the help - I posted the "solution" in the comments.

:)

I had a few of those types already sigh.. They pretty much just had their host switch them over to Linux servers.. because their host told them, they'd be better off with it anyway..

LOL! I know exactly how you feel.. Like I said in a few replies back, that's what the one person did.. except he just used the Fantastico option to install WP... It's like, THANKS MAN!! Thanks a million for the heads up, or telling me you deleted ALL the files I uploaded for ya.. 

Makes ya feel like going through their puter screens to ring some necks LOL! =P  Just kidding.. well, kind of lol.. haha

>(who hopes everyone realizes she has a *very* sarcastic >sense of humor)

I realize it.. I do it sometimes myself lmao.. Well, I just did do it above there.. hahaha.. ;) =)
