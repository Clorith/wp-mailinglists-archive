This was made by  a member called 'install4free'.
That name is admin of the project blog.
The avatar was female.
Tthe install4free member just got the password changed in the blog by me.
It's essentially locked out anyone using it.

Anyone know who / why that post was made?

Wasn't me. Was that post made by the same user that Install4Free
installers use to log in?

Hmmm...I haven't logged in as 'install4free' for a month or two, as I
log in as 'jeremyvisser' now. (I added my account as a user on the
Install4Free blog so I could use my own account.)

I wouldn't have a clue, I couldn't even access the Install4Free site for how loong now!?!!!! I'm like Jeremy, I use my own "Name" to login over at the .COM if need be, or whenever.. 

It sure would be nice to be an installer again though, eh MichaelH? =P I've been posting more in the .ORG forums lately, and will be doing even more there now.. I just have one question though.. when you took that vote from the other installers, and most of them basically voted to keep me, why did you go against the vote anyway, and lock me out over there? 

I can maybe understand the reasoning behind it though, with that losing of the moderator status deal going on, but still, like most said before.. Install4Free doesn't have any TIES or is even RELATED to the WP.org in anyway.. 

I suppose like some said to me though, it could be an EGO issue you were having against me.. but, I still wouldn't know.. you never reply to my email messages or on GTalk, neither does Podz (markr), or Handy..  But, whatever.. everyone is pretending like I don't exist, but only acknowledge me when they can tear me apart.. which IMHO, is just wrong!

Then they have the gonads to rip me apart even MORE on their blog's, when I go to defend myself!!!!!!! That's a bunch of B.S.. I'm not moaning for anything to be changed, because I know it won't be anyway! I'm just moaning, because it hurts that you could have done that to me! 

Everyone tells me to grow up and act like an adult! It's really becoming apparent that THEY are the ones that need to do the growing up! Whatever man, if you want to be like that to me, like everyone else is.. that's fine! 

I just know I never did anything wrong to you! I never would! I made mistakes in my WordPressing days, and now I'm trying to change things for the better, and do better.. 

No one wants to forgive and forget what I had done, but they sure as hell want me to do it for them.. Whatever.. this is saddening .. It truely is! By the way Sam, Shelly and Jeremy, a reply email is on the way!! And thanks Sam for getting me out of your Spam box lol.. ;) :)

OK, this is going to be brief. Sorry if you get this email twice; but
I'm also CC'ing you three installers in case you're not on the list.

I really would like to see Spencer back on the Install4Free team.
Nothing he ever did before affected Install4Free and he was a great
asset when he was on the team.

He's still active on the WP.org forums (much more so than me) and has
no intention of quitting the WordPress community. Well, he installed
Movable Type the other day, but that was more of an experiment. ;)

I will say no more. I believe he'll be a great installer, like he was
before. If you have any objections to him being on the team, please
say so now.

If there are no objections (I'll give you guys a week or so), I'll
bring him back onto the I4F site.

Fortunately, this can easily be ignored as I resigned from the Install team
and tend to just lurk here.
I acknowledge up front that I have no vote or say in the matter.

That would be a great way to show that profanity laced rants, when
done at least
weekly on a wide variety of sites and lists, will get results.   As the
other installers have been singled-out and insulted in some of those rants,
I'd be stunned to see them respond positively.

Subject: [Wp-install] WAMP installations - are they always glitchy?
Message-ID: <1170126485.11237.33.camel@rillian>

In every single WAMP install I've done (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
I've found that WordPress is extremely glitchy.

Glitchy in various ways. For example, sometimes if you load a page,
it'll go blank and you have to refresh to get it to actually show up.
That happens particularly when logging in to the administration.

Also, there tend to be random database errors that when refreshing it'll
come good. I swear it's not my browser cache acting up, though.

The installations always take twice as long to perform, as I tend to
have to go into core files and comment out MySQL checking code.

Linux installations nearly all go fine.

Does anyone else experience the same?

As a side note, how many people here run Linux as their primary OS?
Windows? Mac?

Ah, I remembered to PGP sign my message this time!

Never one to leave a post unanswered...

The only ones I've ever done were for internal company networks (intranet)
hosted on XAMPP or Wampserver.  Never had the problems you noted, but these
were low volume sites for sure!

On a related note, I self-hosted myself for quite a while on a WIMP box.  I
was pretty impressed with that one -- and it handled some good volume -- but
ultimately I switched to LAMP stack.  Akismet was a bit wonky, I never did
get GD2 (thumbnails) on it and pretty permalinks just couldn't happen
(although, since then, I've seen some interesting 3rd party approaches to
that).

XP primarily, but I always have a linux laptop next to me.  My first distro
was Ygdrasil (spelling?) back in the early 90s.  Sent away for it on a
QIC-80 tape...  I've done quite a few years with linux as primary, but as a
small business owner, I gotta have my QuickBooks.  Wine support isn't there
and starting a vmware session to get to my ledgers got too tedious.  And no,
gnuCash isn't just like QuickBooks -- save the response.  :-)

No mac, yet.  Been looking hard at those laptops the last few years though.
