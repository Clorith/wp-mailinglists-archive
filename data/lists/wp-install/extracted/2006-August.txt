There has been a pending Spanish help Request for a little while now. It's 
comment #23 in the Moderation Queue hehe.

Just thought I'd give the heads up on it.. ;)

Subject: [Wp-install] Inregards to Install4free..
Message-ID: <020001c6b9cf$421180d0$de7a9041@computer>

I want to ask this on the wp-forums list, besides just the wp-install list.. 
to get even more feedback, suggestions, opinions and so forth. And, to also 
make it more of a "community" discussion, rather then just amongst the 
Install4free installers.

Here's what I was thinking of, since the Install4free launched on July, 12, 
2006,  "we've" had numerous installation requests, which I think the end 
result of the installations are going great!

While communication between the "installers", and the "clients", are pretty 
good as well, I've received a few wonderful replies back from the clients.

My question is this, what do you all think of maybe starting a Testimonial 
page, containing a few nice words from the "clients", after their 
installation was completed? Of course, maybe just keep their names limited 
to *only* first names, or whatever..

IMHO, I think this would help the Install4free project out, as a self 
promotional option. ;)  Also, with all those "negative" replies to the first 
initial forum thread, I think this will help "us", as the Install4free 
project, even more.. =)

Of course, this idea, suggestion, and opinion's fate, are held in the hands 
of the masses.. =p  I was just curious about it, and please feel free to 
share your thoughts on this of course. =)

I'm typing this up, while a few wonderful replies from "my clients" are 
sitting in my inbox. =) They just staring me in the face, and I want to 
share them to the world.. but, I can't yet lol. =P

Subject: [Wp-install] Inregards to a request, with Blog by Email..
Message-ID: <039501c6bb6c$05da4310$c9d29041@computer>

I'm not sure about this Blog by Email stuff yet, but maybe if someone has 
any ideas on how to handle such a request, it would be awesome. =)

Here's a copy of the help request, from the Moderation Queue..

"Hello,
I am a PERSON who runs a non-profit for sick children from HOME and would 
like to know if I qualify for your help installing WordPress on my domain.

I've been using Blogger to run 10 different Blogs and am tired of posts not 
showing because all I use is "Blog by Email" and it never works right over 
there.

I need to have separate Blogs on my domain and need the "Blog by Email" 
fully functional to accept posts coming from different email addresses.

Please let me know if you can help! Thanks!! "

It's comment #30.. I was going to email he/she.. but just not sure on it 
yet.. Anyone want to take this one, under their wing lol!?

I'm seeing a nice number of pending "install" requests in the Moderation Queue, and was wondering what we should do about these...?

Example, a few dated back to around the Install4free first started, and apparently the user's haven't replied to the emails sent, by "us" the installers.. =/

UTC 2006-07-13 7:59:42 pm MichaelH has contacted user and is awaiting response from the user.

Should one of "us" resend an email to these users, or just suspect, that they had installed it themselves and remove those comments? 

Also, about the requests that had been completed already, is there a way to archive those, so were not loading 50 comments on the Moderation Queue page lol?  Just was curious about these two things lately.. =P =)

There are quite a few "pending" install requests that no one is 
answering back to. I'd say delete them after x number of days - if 
interested, they will get back in touch.
Also I agree with archiving somehow to make the list easier to 
read/navigate.

Yeah, that's what I was thinking too, but..I'd probably rather re-send them 
a follow-up email first, and if they didn't reply to that one.. Delete them.

Yeah, I'm just not sure how that would/could be handled though.. =/  Isn't 
that supposed to happen by default though, basically.. ?  I mean, after X 
amount of comments listed in the moderation queue.. aren't they supposed to 
fall back into a "page" of comments..?  Like, page one, page two.. so 
forth.. =/

I'm not sure, because I really had too many comments posted on my blog 
before lol. Is there maybe some form of plugin that would be able to help 
"us" with that? I know it's on the wordpress.com site.. so, that in itself 
might be a problem sigh.. I dunno.. any more thoughts maybe?
