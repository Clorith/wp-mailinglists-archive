Subject: [Wp-install] User Import problem
Message-ID: <454237C6.6010302@bleedingthreats.net>

I'm trying to convert a few thousand users into a new WP install. The
import goes well, no errors, tables look fine. But if I add more than
about 950 users the user management page craps out, meaving me unable to
even see users, or manage them.

I have to assume there's not a limit like that, anyone have an idea what
could be an issue here?

No errors in the logs, just a zero byte page back if I try to go to the
authors and users page. I can edit the admin account just fine.

I've tried two methods of import. Direct sql with a conversion from the
old, And using the plugin here:

http://www.dagondesign.com/files/dd-import-users.txt

Neither way shows errors on import. Nothing in logs, the wp_users and
usermeta tables appear to be fine, just large.

Running on debian, mysql5, apache2, php5. Very standard install.
Dedicated box to this task only.

Ideas VERY welcome. :)

Matt

Thanks, did so. Figured it out internally. Memory usage issue. A login
lookup uses massive amounts of ram if you have a lot of users. We're
going to have to move to external auth somehow, as is won't support
large (>10k) users without several gigs of ram just for login lookups....

Subject: [Wp-install] Status of install4free 
Message-ID: <016601c6fd36$4fd1ab00$6402a8c0@DELL8600>

Hello list,

As of today,  the install4free team has completed over 400 installations of
WordPress.  English, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, German, Swedish, and Norwegian
versions of WordPress have been installed by four team members.

But, there is a need for one or two more people to participate, as only
three people from this list: https://install4free.wordpress.com/?page_id=10
are now active in the project.

So the question is, who still wants to be included on the list of installers
and if you still desire to be on the list, are you willing to perform
installations?

If you wish to still be included on the list of installers, please email the
wp-install list as to your intentions.

NOTE:  you may need to manually enter wp-install@lists.automattic.com in the
To: field if you reply to this email.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Michael E. Hancock

I'm one of the four, and I'm proud to have done my installations.. ;) =) I think it's great that we are providing this "service", and hopefully we'll continue to have more! Which of course, is undoubtful lol.. =P

Hey now! Just because I haven't done any lately, for the past few weeks, doesn't mean I should be excluded from the "do-er list" .. lmao!! =P 

>So the question is, who still wants to be included on the list of installers and if you still desire to be on the list, are you willing to perform installations?

I'd like to remain on the list, of course! I never said I wanted to be removed.. and even if I did want removed.. I'd remove my name from the page, myself.. ;) =P 

The only thing is, like I said before.. with me on shit dialup connections.. THANKS JUNO!! by the way.. the moderation queue load time, sucks ass.. sigh. =(  Well, it is JUNO'S fault really!! Haha..anyway.. I might be back around doing some installs again soon.. patience people! =P
