Every few weeks, I get an email from a concerned WordPress.com
customer that wants to make sure that we know that
install4free.wordpress.com is there and it is not a scam. Some of them
do not understand that there is also an installable version.

Anyway, it has been plenty of time to get
http://install4free.wordpress.net going.

Thanks,

Yeah, you tell em! Lmao! Did MarkR ever reply back to Jeremy Visser 
about that script/layout, by Visser? Last I heard it's been 3 months or 
more without a response.. :P I still have a copy of that though, I think 
it's awesome. However, I heard that the back-end of the script/layout or 
whatever wasn't finished? How's that coming along Jeremy? /Me thinks, 
time to check out the SVN fer it again lmao...

Yeah, I'm really sorry about taking so long. At the moment, I'm coding
the whole bang lot from scratch all by myself, and if anyone wants
commit access on the SVN repository, I'd gladly give it to you. I would
appreciate the help.

For the most part, it works (you can try it out yourself if you like),
just the backend is unpolished/nonpresent. In trunk, I have a working
profile page, and it wouldn't be hard to add a list of open tickets.

Also, I'm still waiting on Mark for getting SSL going. I already have a
certificate (signed by CAcert, as I have 100 'assurance points' from
them) - just that he needs to set up SSL for me. If I go to
https://install4free.wordpress.net/ it responds in HTTP.

BTW Spence, seeing as though I now have my own domain (sunriseroad.net)
it would be better if you now accessed the repository through these new
URLs:

WebSVN (tarballs)
	https://svn.sunriseroad.net/browser/

Repository
	https://svn.sunriseroad.net/install4free/

Thanks for the quick response.

I did not realize you were coding something. It definitely is an
awesome initiative!

I will check on the https issue.

Once that is resolved, if your system is not ready, maybe you can
temporarily...you know... use WordPress like you are on WordPress.com
.

Thank you,

As suggested by Lloyd, http://install4free.wordpress.net/ is now live.

The new site functions pretty much exactly the same way as the old one.
I was having some last-minute non-critical cosmetic issues with the
comments submission, but apart from that, it seems to be working fine.

Beta site (my next-gen site) is available at:
http://install4free.wordpress.net/beta/

Fixed. I forgot to create the dummy avatar_by_id() function when using a
WP.com theme.

(I was using the Sapphire theme from the WP.com repo because it is
widgets-enabled.)
