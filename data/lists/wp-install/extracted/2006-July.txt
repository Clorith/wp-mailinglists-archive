Podz,

You might ask Matt to consider changing the mailman configuration, "Where
are replies to list messages directed?" so that replies are directed to
"this list" instead of "the poster."

Thanks--that makes it easier when replying to email from the list.

And I know it's a little picky, but he might also want to change "Prefix for
subject line of list postings" to [wp-install] instead of [Wp-install].

Regards

That might be a good idea.... so far, each time I try to reply to this
list, it's been going back to the poster. In order to get this one to go
back to the list, I had to copy out the address from the footer and
paste it into the To box.

I don't see that this project should be anything other than a democracy.
We all know what we are doing, we all agree and within personal limits
we will all work toward the same goal. I don't think it should be 'run'
by anyone or that we wait for decisions from anyone - we just get on and
do. And if needed we have a vote and go with that. If we start off with
any sort of figurehead I can see this failing - it must be above
personalities. Hopefully a vote will pass that :)
At #wordpress-meetup tomorrow night I will also make it clear that
anyone who blogs it mentions no names. I don't want to see "Podz
said..." and that sort of stuff (see above) because it's a joint thing.
There is a .org forum login/pass as user 'install4free' in the blog
which may prove useful. It also needed grabbing just in case.

I was thinking more along the lines of 36 hours or so.... also add a
note that there may be a slightly longer delay over the weekends ??? I
don't know about anyone else, but I don't get on much over the
weekends.... mostly during the week.

Refresh my memory (again) on the notification?  How are the
"installers"notified when someone makes a request?  Does it go to this
list?

If so, then I'd think 24 or 48 would be reasonable (I might lean
towards 48 just for sanity's sake, but then again... I can understand
that folks like near-instant gratification too).

It's my understanding that it will just be a comment on the blog....
that it's not going to be forwarded (If I'm wrong, some one correct me
please)... I was simply planning on using the Comment RSS feed for my

Replies here - top idea though actually what about others seeing it in
time? This list is open to scrutiny (as it should be) and it'll get
found at some point. Is the feed grabbable for not-yet-moderated comments?

hmmm.... I'll have to figure out something else then.....can we .....

passwords being available when they shouldn't be.

Heeey.... that's the trick.. "Reply to All" ... du'h... I went so far as
to add wp-i to my addr book, then when I hit reply, I just delete the
address there and type Wp-i and TB takes over and fills the rest in for
me...

I just commented. The feed:
http://install4free.wordpress.com/comments/feed
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
- <!--  generator="wordpress/MU"
  -->
- <rss version="2.0"

so that's a zero.

Emailing this list.. we'll see what comes through. Though I imagine it's
what you said above TG.

In which case we need to login to the blog to find out....or as we are
all logged in, visit the page?

If you wanted to use the list as a 'notification' device...

Matt can configure the question "Is archive file source for public or
private archival?" to be "private" so only list members can view the
archives.

Then Matt would have to subscribe the email address (e.g.
admin@install4free.wordpress.com??) that is being used by the install4free
website to send comments.  He could also set the "nomail" option on that
account so it doesn't receive email back from the list.

My preference would be that this list is not made private.
Partly because no WP list is private, partly because it could lead to
people saying they were doing this when they are not and there being no
real way for others to ask publicly and also because if the list were to
go public at a later date then either information is hidden or the
archives are removed. I don't think any of the above is ideal.

I would prefer an IMAP solution, probably Gmail?
It remains person agnostic, it's trusted by millions of people for their
privacy already, it allows tracking of conversations if that is needed.

I don't think we can get an ideal solution.

The overall best solution for me is no email - just wander over to the
blog and check what is not acknowledged. We have no worries at all then
and no hassle with email checking because we go to the work and not the
work comes to us.

We can always try solutions for a while, no reason why we can't switch?

Message-ID: <005e01c6a82f$7b6edc30$6402a8c0@DELL8600>

I would have directed this to Podz but looks like he has taken his name off
the list of install4free installers, so I will ask this here:

Does anyone know about installing WordPress in Spanish?

There's an outstanding request to install in Spanish and I'm not comfortable
enough to answer that request.  I see they've blogged about the install4free
service at http://planeta.wordpress.com.mx/ so guess we need to find someone
able to do that.

Any suggestions appreciated.

anything on the list lately.. =/ Maybe that's just because people are busy, 
so..that's cool.

I was just wondering about some things here.. I just noticed a comment in 
the moderation Queue, comment #17 specifically.

Apparently, they have their blog up and running already..but need some other 
type of assistance.. Here's what was said, snipped from the Moderation 
Queue..

<snipped>
This is probaby weird. Forgive me! I have a wordpress installed but I don't 
know how to use it. For example, I want to enter new entries every two or 
three days and have them available to viewers. Nothing special there, right? 
How do I do that? my blog is at:
Your new WordPress blog has been successfully set up at:
http://www.bookslibros.com/bitacoracervantes/wp-admin
thanks, forgive my stupidity. I am an old guy, Frank </snipped>

Q:1) Now, should "we" just email him, and tell him what to do maybe, or 
should we direct him to the support forums? I was *going to* email him, and 
lend a hand.. but, I just wanted to ask *everyone* first.

Q:2 ) After MichaelH had brought about the "Spanish" speaking people, 
requesting help. 
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-install/2006-July/000016.html

Is there anyone that maybe knows various languages that "we" could bring 
aboard this project? IMHO, I think this would help tremendously. ;)

Q:3) I know we are supposed to use the "latest stable" release of 
WordPress..v2.0.3. But! Being that there is "bugs" or "problems" with that 
version.. should we automatically install that "tune up" plugin.. to fix 
those problems first off?

Just was bringing this up, because.. after we'd do a installation of it, and 
they happen to see those errors or what not, they might *think* it was "our 
fault" and such.. =/  I'm all for making the people happy with an 
installation of WP, but.. I'd hate to see them frown when they happen to 
find those errors possibly.. ;)

Ok, that's all for the questions now lol.. =p  I just hope everyone is 
getting my emails though.. =/

I suggest emailing him to contact the WordPress Support Forums.  I'd
probably delete the request.

I haven't seen a response to my email either, was just hoping someone could
install a Spanish WordPress.  I notice there's a second request also.

I'd still install the "latest stable" release available at
http://wordpress.org/download/ so that the people in the Support Forums
always know what version we are installing--bugs or not.

And of course by now you know your email are getting to the list.  Regards.

Ok, thanks Michael. =)  I was thinking the same, but just wanted to get 
*anyone's* opinions and suggestions first. ;)

Yeah, if *only*I knew various languages sigh, "we'd" be all set then. =)

Ok,.. I can agree with you on that. ;)

Since I was composing this for the latest volunteer samboll, thought I'd
share this info with the group.

Here's a sample email I send to requesting individuals asking for their
login info
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi John,

I'm know as MichaelH http://wordpress.org/support/profile/18989 on the
WordPress Support Forums.

You've asked that we install WordPress at your site.

Once you provide the following information, I'll  proceed to install
WordPress 2.0.3 at the domain you specify.

What is the domain WordPress is to be installed in?

Who is your host (example www.godaddy.com)?

Where do you login to manage your host account (example Cpanel login)?

What is your host login?

What is your host password?

What is your ftp IP address?

What is your ftp login?

What is your ftp password?

Thank you.

Here's a sample of the email I send after I've completed the install:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
