    "body": "Better late than never I guess. My name's Brian Milne, and I'm a blogoholic. Like most of you, I'm an avid WP supporter with more WP blogs than any human should have. Unlike most of you, I'm no pro when it comes to development and even design work once you get beyond the basic frontend stuff. \nBut I've done plenty of UX work over the years and know a good UI when I see one having worked with dozens of brutal (and I mean brutal) CMS/publishing systems in the newspaper business. \nAs for my background, I have a journalism degree from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, Calif., and spent nearly a decade as a web editor/senior writer for McClatchy Newspapers. I've since bailed on the newspaper biz to be a copywriter, content manager for a few local tech companies and have provided copy/content management for McClatchy, Web Associates/LEVEL Studios, HP, Experts Exchange and About.com. \nMcClatchy's local paper and About.com use MU to power their blogs, so that's where my WP background comes into play. That and a handful of personal blogs and small business websites I've built around WP. I've also authored a couple of guidebooks on other topics and am working on a WordPress guidebook as we speak.\nSo my focus is copywriting and content management if you need any help there. Other than that, I can do some testing and will offer feedback if needed. I use Axure for wireframes, but am willing to test any prototypes thrown my way. I'm still on the Central Coast of Calif., so I'm usually on hand for WordCamps from LA to the Bay. I'm the pale, redheaded beanpole if you ever want to say hey. \nAs far as improvements/suggestions: Other than making a wombat the WP mascot, an idea I like is adding the preview functionality -- similar to what we have on posts and pages -- to the theme editor. Don't know how realistic that is, or if it's already in the works, but there's a couple pennies for ya. \nLet me know if I can be of service. \n- B\nbrianmilne at att.net\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-ui/attachments/20100127/f1aab17d/attachment.htm\u003e",

Yes, they match the visual/html tabs, but that is a\n\u003e perfect reason NOT to have the page tabs look this way. Switching\n\u003e visual/html is a small change that manages just one part of a large\n\u003e complex page (edit-post.php). These new tabs will be doing MUCH MORE\n\u003e than that, altering the entire content of the page, losing any changes\n\u003e done to the previous 'tab'. As such I think they need to look\n\u003e significantly more important than the visual/html distinction, and I\n\u003e think the second option makes way more sense for several reasons\n\u003e stated below.\n\u003e\n\u003e Importantly, I think people are completely wrong to say the\n\u003e title-style tabs are too big or 'take up too much space'. If you open\n\u003e both mockups and switch back and forth you'll see that the large tabs\n\u003e actually take up LESS vertical space than the small ones, because the\n\u003e tab labels serve both needs, tab AND page title, removing entirely the\n\u003e need for a huge page title above the tabs.\n\u003e\n\u003e In fact, if you look carefully at the two mockups you'll see that\n\u003e Gaston seems to have accidentally favored the small tabs by making the\n\u003e two ideas take up the same vertical space even though the 'big tabs'\n\u003e have less height: in the big tabs mockup there is extra unnecessary\n\u003e padding between the tabs and the list of links. If we clean up that\n\u003e space we see that the big tabs take up less space while simultaneously\n\u003e giving much more precedence to the tabs themselves, making the whole\n\u003e system more useful and harder to miss at a glance.\n\u003e\n\u003e Actually, after putting them side by side and cleaning up some other\n\u003e spacing issues (the big tabs weren't vertically aligned with the\n\u003e sidebar, pushing them down even further) in photoshop I was pleased to\n\u003e see that the difference in vertical space consumption was 100%\n\u003e opposite of what people thought in responses so far. I think this\n\u003e resulting graphic shows very clearly how much space is actually saved\n\u003e by going with the title-tabs:\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e http://simianuprising.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wp-tabbed-admin-pages-wrong.png\n\u003e\n\u003e So #2 is the real space-saver, and if that is our main concern we\n\u003e should not choose #1.\n\u003e\n\u003e The other concern is consistency with the current design, which is\n\u003e obviously important both for maintaining the smallest possible set of\n\u003e design patterns to keep things simple and for avoiding users\n\u003e accustomed to the old way from being alienated from the new way. In\n\u003e that case I think that #2 still has a lot going for it.\n\u003e\n\u003e While there may not be a precedent where UI tabs look exactly like\n\u003e that I think we're missing the fact that it has the extremely valuable\n\u003e feature that it matches how PAGE TITLES are currently shown. If these\n\u003e are page titles and not sub-sections of a single page, having them\n\u003e look like page titles is a good idea. The fact that the outline and\n\u003e shading of the tabs should take as much from the visual/html editor as\n\u003e possible is fairly obvious, and I think #2 does a good job of merging\n\u003e together the styles of the visual/html tabs with the normal look of\n\u003e page titles in WP Admin.\n\u003e\n\u003e -------\n\u003e\n\u003e All that said I think the bigger question is exactly what we're trying\n\u003e to achieve here. Sorry if I missed an earlier conversation about what\n\u003e the tabs are for, but I see two possibilities each with important\n\u003e ramifications:\n\u003e\n\u003e A - We are fundamentally removing pages from the admin and merging\n\u003e them together. We would just make one long-ass page and tell people to\n\u003e scroll but we would rather clean it up with tabs.\n\u003e    * The goal is to have less choices in the sidebar to make things\n\u003e simpler.\n\u003e    * It is a bit harder to get to specific tabs/pages (especially\n\u003e secondary tabs) but maybe its worth it.\n\u003e    * In this case the deleted page should be removed from the sidebar\n\u003e as in the mockups.\n\u003e    * We should use mockup #1, as it clearly denotes that the new page\n\u003e is only one page with two sub-tabs that compose it.\n\u003e    * Switching tabs should not reload the page, but instead use\n\u003e javascript to jump back and forth in the content which is already\n\u003e loaded.\n\u003e\n\u003e B - We are grouping together related pages to make it easier to find\n\u003e related pages.\n\u003e    * The goal is not to have less pages but to make navigation\n\u003e between pages easier.\n\u003e    * All pages are still visible in the sidebar (unlike in the\n\u003e big-tabs mockup), but it is easier to see what pages are related to\n\u003e the current one in the header tabs.\n\u003e    * Each page is still its own url and switching 'tabs' merely jumps\n\u003e you to the new page, with a full html reload.\n\u003e    * Mockup #2 (big tabs) should be used because it maintains the\n\u003e individuality of each page while still denoting their relatedness and\n\u003e making it easier to navigate between pages.\n\u003e    * It also serves to denote subservience of one page to the other\n\u003e in a useful way (i.e. if you are in the 2nd tab of a set then you know\n\u003e that the first one is probably the more important one. i.e. Manage\n\u003e themes is more important/common than install themes).\n\u003e\n\u003e IMHO these two goals are very different and require different solutions.\n\u003e\n\u003e I personally don't like the first (A) option. I think the\n\u003e relationships it defines will tend to redundantly replace the\n\u003e relationships present in the different sidebar sections. I also think\n\u003e that removing sections with lots of options from the sidebar will make\n\u003e things harder to find overall. If we do this it should be with extreme\n\u003e caution, and the example in the mockups should not be executed because\n\u003e these two pages are not part of the same options, but rather\n\u003e fundamentally different.\n\u003e\n\u003e I personally like the intention of the second option (B) even though\n\u003e I'm not totally convinced its necessary. I often find myself on an\n\u003e admin page wishing for direct links to related pages in the header. A\n\u003e perfect example is the newly added 'add new' button in the headers of\n\u003e Edit Posts and Edit Pages. I'd been dying for that since 2.7 came out.\n\u003e In a similar way I think the big-title-tabs system proposed in mockup\n\u003e #2 would help people get many tasks done more easily.\n\u003e\n\u003e There are problems with the idea (B) though, the biggest being how\n\u003e strange it would be to have some pages in a sidebar section grouped\n\u003e into tab-groups but not others. Why not have 'edit themes' and 'theme\n\u003e widgets' mixed into the header tabs for the appearance pages? Looking\n\u003e at my settings sidebar section makes me even more nervous. What pages\n\u003e would be linked together and which would be orphaned? With time I\n\u003e could learn the idiosyncratic relationships the pages have to each\n\u003e other, but for new users it would probably seem relatively random.\n\u003e Another problem is that any more than a few big tabs would be too much\n\u003e for many screens to show and they'd drop to a second line, which would\n\u003e just look awful.\n\u003e\n\u003e -----\n\u003e\n\u003e Sorry for the ludicrously long post. Hopefully it has some food for\n\u003e thought going forward.\n\u003e\n\u003e --\n\u003e Jeremy Clarke | http://jeremyclarke.org\n\u003e Code and Design | http://globalvoicesonline.org\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e ------------------------------\n\u003e\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e wp-ui mailing list\n\u003e wp-ui at lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-ui\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e End of wp-ui Digest, Vol 2, Issue 12\n\u003e ************************************\n\u003e\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-ui/attachments/20100221/95842f62/attachment.htm\u003e",

Is it something a theme can support/not support like page thumbnails.\nThat would be the idea, though I imagine it would to be more like\nregistering a widget sidebar, versus registering post thumbnail support. I\nhave not seen the Woo code but that is my understanding anyway, and is what\nwas indicated as desired when scope for 3.0 was set.\nI realise this may not be the right place to ask these questions, but I\n\u003e haven't heard anything about this on the wp-hackers list (I only signed up\n\u003e in the last couple of weeks) nor have I seen anything about it anywhere\n\u003e else. And I don't have a woo theme.(I probably should buy one). Can anyone\n\u003e point me to where this is being discussed? And a timeline for its\n\u003e implementation?\nIt was first mentioned publicly on the wp-ui list and on Trac yesterday. It\nwas then discussed in the weekly dev chat on #wordpress-dev.\nWoo is currently preparing a patch for core. Jane said we should anticipate\nseeing the patch posted to Trac early next week, at which point it would go\nthrough the same thorough review as any other patch, and be subject to\nmodifications, improvements, and a series of commits.\nIf you want to follow along development (in general), wp-hackers won't help.\nI'd keep an eye on:\nhttp://core.trac.wordpress.org, specifically\nhttp://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11817 for menu management\nhttp://wpdevel.wordpress.com\nand #wordpress-dev on IRC\nNacin\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-ui/attachments/20100212/46f26fbb/attachment.htm\u003e",

I've done all the UI work on\nthat product and is SLIGHTLY representative of my work. (IMO, there's a lot\nmore under the hood than that video really shows.) I'd like to think I have\na keen eye for aesthetics despite the lack of formal training and an almost\nOCD-type level for attention to detail.\nI'm hoping to learn a lot from everyone else. The one aspect i'm truly\ninterested in improving on WP is how it handles media within posts. It's SO\nfreaking painful to add pictures from outside sources without hotlinking and\nwhile what's there is good...I have some other ideas. More often than not, I\nend up biting off more than I can chew professionally, but I'm looking\nforward to seeing what can be accomplished with a product that I think is\nfantastic and want to give a little back in return.\nCheers!\nMike\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-ui/attachments/20100122/d9a7bdb5/attachment.htm\u003e",

Each box is, generally, a collection of inputs within \nan all encompassing form. Ideally these should be in fieldset's, with \naccompanying legend's.\nAdditionally, text inside a form, not in labels or fieldsets, isn't \nreadable by 'all' screen readers when in _forms mode_.\nhttp://www.pws-ltd.com/sections/articles/2008/accessible_forms.html\nJAWS 10 may be addressing this issue, but it will be a long time \nbefore that is widely used, and it should not be the only screen \nreader considered to be in use.\nHowever correlating the necessary changes would involve a great deal \nof work and time. Actually making the changes would involve more work, \nand more time.\nSo I suppose the crux is, is accessibility a high priority? If it \nisn't I doubt that the core team can spare the man hours and any work \nthat I might do is likely to become obsolete very quickly if not \nimplemented sooner rather than later.\nI'm more than happy to put in the time and effort but would feel more \ncomfortable knowing that we are on the same page when it comes to \naccessibility. If not then I can put that effort elsewhere within \nWordPress.\nRich",

    "body": "Dear Friends,\nMy name is Ronen (http://www.iamronen.com) and I live in the north of \nIsrael in a small village called Elkosh \nhttp://www.iamronen.com/2009/03/elkosh/.\n3+ years ago I left behind a 15 year information technology career in \nwhich I specialized in systems analysis, management and the last two \nyears were dedicated to digital product design. I am a Yoga practitioner \nand teacher and I play Shakuhachi \nhttp://www.iamronen.com/2009/04/sounds-of-shakuhachi/. Since my break \nfrom the business of technology I have immersed myself as a photographer \nin an artistic exploration with improvisation performance artists \n(http://www.stillcreation.com). I am currently involved in numerous \nself-initiated projects and rarely work commercially.\nI encountered WordPress ~3 years ago and have enjoyed it greatly both \nfor expressing myself and for enabling others to communicate with the \nworld. I have since moved to using mostly open-source solutions and have \ngreat respect for the people leading in this direction. I have been \nlooking for a way to give back to open-source by contributing my product \ndesign skills. I have recently begun interacting with the Mozilla \nRaindrop team and am now looking forward to partaking in this new \nWordPress process.\nFor me product design is a process of choosing and pursuing a purpose \n(for a product) with care. Though I can contribute on the UI/UX level my \npatience for these details is limited - I believe that too much noodling \naround with these details can be a sign of lack of direction and is \noften done at the expense of actions that have a higher leverage and \nmore impact on the product. I feel that **as an end-user product** \nWordPress has been making little and insignificant progress since 2.7.\nI have two distinct purposes in mind for WordPress. One is a REALLY \nsimple blogging platform (in the direction Tumblr is heading) that \nanyone can use. The other is an open-source substitute for Facebook - an \napplication that every-day-non-blogger people can use to store, \ncommunicate and socialize with other people online. I would love for \nWordPress to reach many more people then it currently does. I believe \nthat inevitably most people will have (many already do) an online \npresence - I prefer that that presence be established on open-source \nsoftware and self-owned solutions (I collect my thoughts and resources \non this issue at: http://www.iamronen.com/ontekusuto/).\nI feel that WordPress is still waaaay too technical and addresses mostly \nneeds of technically-minded people. I believe one of the core reasons \nfor this is that, like all the other open-source projects I have \nencountered, it is dominated and led by developers.Therefore, I believe \nthis effort to bring designers into the process is a wonderful \nundertaking and has the potential to break new grounds for open-source \nsoftware (which generally suffers from poor product design). I am not \npleased to find that it will be limited to narrow UI perspective - but \nmaybe that is an inevitable starting point - time will tell! I believe \nWordPress deserves not only better GUI/UI but also an open high-level \ndiscussion of where it is headed - a discussion about purpose.\nThank you Jane \u0026 Automattic for initiating this process.\nAll Things Good\nRonen",

I simply wanted to let anyone who may be interested know the text is now online, and to please provide any feedback or comments you feel necessary!\nWebsite: http://www.appliedanthrodesign.com/thesis/\nAbstract:\nThe  increasing rate of technological innovation and integration into \nthe daily  lives of many online users has spurred both the \nreconceptualization of the  digital divide, and the promotion of \nuser-centered research methods; that emphasize  the significance of \nvariability in technology acquisition. No longer is  technology to be \nconsidered an external tool, where success depends on basic  \nfunctionality, but an integrated player affected by the social relations\n and  environment in which it resides. Through Niklas Luhmann?s systems \ntheory in  combination with actor-network theory, this study aims to \nlook first at the  systems in which nonprofits and web designers \nseparately operate; how their  processes are altered with the \nintroduction of design ethnography and  Wordpress; and finally which \nhuman and nonhuman actors may be utilized in the  creation of websites \nfor nonprofits who desire technological self-sufficiency.\nBest,\nKristina Krause\n \t\t \t   \t\t  \n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-ui/attachments/20100914/4362f024/attachment.htm\u003e",

First off I am a freelance graphic artist that specializes in 3d motion graphics. I have been designing web projects for over 10 years. I use html, css, php,msql, javascript, what ever it takes to archive an end result. I am one that who sees from an artistic eye first and coding isnt my first love, but I can hold my own.  \nI mainly use C4D, After Effects and Photoshop for artistic expression. I also use MODO, MAYA, Houdini, Realflow, and syntheyes for match moving. I have also dabbled in plugin development using c++ This is mainly because the C4D sdk is best utilized in visual studio instead of python ( the script language doe most of the 3d world) and I didnt take the time to learn c.o.f.f.e.e (c4d script language). \n I have recently become a photography blogger and plan to lurk here. However if I can be of any help in an artistic level. I would be happy to volunteer my services. I see with over 300 people responding, there is plenty of coders better suited than I. I will follow along and hope I can find a way to contribute. Thanks for allowing me to be apart of this great community. I look forward to great things.

Since then I've  \ncontinued to use WP for both personal projects and in my freelance  \nwork.  A somewhat outdated portfolio can be found at http://andreamignolo.com \n, and my personal blog using WP is at http://protocol7.net.\nI'm excited to see where open source design can go, and am looking  \nforward to contributing anywhere I can.  I'd love to see the \"janky\"  \npage ordering implementation finally addressed, and I'd like to dive  \ninto the media uploader/manager/related bits more.  And also more  \nnuanced admin interface for navigating sites with a large number of  \npages (especially those that have multiple hierarchies of pages)...\nGood to meet you all, looking forward to what 2010 brings :)\nCheers,\npnts\n---\nAndrea Mignolo\nProtocol 7\nhttp://protocol7.net\nhttp://twitter.com/pnts",

I'm not sure how many of you are people who  \nactually want to get involved and contribute to the UI/UX work that  \ngoes into making WordPress, vs. how many are developers or users who  \njust want to keep up with what's going on or offer feedback on other  \npeople's design work, so I think the first thing this list should do  \nis help everyone get to know who's here. Lurkers need not do this, but  \nif you're planning to contribute to the UI work ahead, please email  \nthis list and tell us a little bit about you: Your work background/ \ncurrent job, specific design/usability/accessibility skills/talents  \nthat we should know about/make use of, what you hope to contribute to  \nWP UI, your location/time zone, and maybe the one UI thing you would  \nlike to address in WP if given the chance. My main goal here is to  \nfind out how many people of all the subscribers are actually people  \nwho can wireframe, make comps, run usability testing, etc, vs. simply  \nwanting to weigh in with opinions on the work of others (which can  \nhappen on Trac tickets). This list is meant to be a working group.\nAfter people have had a day or two to introduce themselves, we'll have  \na better idea of how many people are actually planning to participate  \nin this list for now, and can plan accordingly. I've got a list as  \nlong as my arm of potential design projects we can divvy up into  \ngroups, so knowing people's backgrounds and interests will help  \ndetermine which projects we hit first. We can also then decide on a  \nday/time for a weekly UI chat in IRC.\nI'm in the process of setting up a site for this group to use a la  \nwpdevel.wordpress.com, and will start adding people as authors once we  \nhave created teams and begun working on projects and there are things  \nto report. I'll need to know your wordpress.org login name to add you  \nto the site. Usability people are welcome and encouraged to speak up  \nalso, not just designers. Getting the plan up and running for  \ndistributed testing is on the goals list, too.\nI guess I'll start. I'm Jane, and am the main UX person for WordPress.  \nI led the admin redesign of 2.7, and work closely with the core team  \non UI changes. We never have time to get to everything, so there's  \nstill a ton left to do. I work for Automattic, which donates a big  \nchunk of my time to the open source project. Before this job, I'd  \nworked at agencies, companies and research groups in almost every  \nfront-end web job there is over the last 10 years. Though mostly UX  \nstuff, I've also done project management, content development, HTML,  \nvisual design, testing, etc. Right now I'm a bottleneck for UI changes  \nin WordPress, and anyone who works in this industry knows that it  \ntakes a lot longer to create a wireframe deck than it does to sketch  \nan idea, so I'm hoping to grow this group into a healthy contributor  \ncommunity so that I can step back into more of a advisory/curatorial  \nrole rather than slowing things down while I draft wireframes or  \nconduct individual testing sessions. I'm on the east coast, and would  \nlove it if the weekly chat could be during the day sometime before  \n3pm, but if the majority needs to have an evening meeting instead, I  \ncan work with that. I traditionally do wireframes in Omnigraffle, but  \nwould like to find a good open source tool (the ones I've tried  \nhaven't been great) that we can all use for this if possible. I  \ngenerally go for Photoshop for comps, and have not found GIMP to be an  \nadequate substitute, though I'd love to move visual design to open  \nsource tools as well. Suggestions are welcome.\nI'll be happy to answer questions, point to resources etc for those  \nwho want to get involved. However, this is not the right place (yet,  \nanyway) to come if you are just getting started and want to learn the  \ndesign/UX trade as a new career move or something. I'd like to start  \noff with more experienced UI/UX people just to get some processes  \nnailed down. I hope that in the future the WP UI group will be an  \nawesome place to come to learn new skills.\nWho's next?\nJane",

I am a database and web developer based out of Des\nMoines, IA (Central Time Zone). I have worked in the web development arena\nfor about 8 years, with a short stint off for about 2-3 years where I\nfocused my efforts in enterprise database development. A year ago I left\nthat firm and started my own company, and since then have re-realized my\npassion for web development. Played a bit of catch-up in the technologies\nover the past year, where I found and fell in love with WordPress and its\nterrific community. I have used it in pretty much all my client's websites.\nI will be attending WordCamp Chicago this year, and intend on running one\nout here in Iowa in the near future.\nI have decent server-side and client-side development skills, but find\nmyself enjoying the UI/UX side more. So I figured why not cut my teeth as a\nWordPress contributor with this endeavor and help the community that I feel\nI already owe so much to. I do feel one of my strong suits that grows from\nall my report design experience is a keen eye for formatting large sets of\ndata for ease of use, so perhaps that might help with the divvying up that\nJane intends to do. I know my way around the basics of Photoshop and like\nBalsamiq for wireframing. I also like to think that I write decent copy when\nso inspired.\nSo this is me officially throwing my hat into the ring, and I intend to help\nwhen and where I can. However, I'll never over-commit myself, and understand\nthat a lot of the time \"no\" is the best answer.\nEager to meet the rest or you.\n-Kenny\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-ui/attachments/20100119/1c325174/attachment-0001.htm\u003e",

I'm also going to (at least initially) be in\na technical theatre / theatre design program. But the biggest scratch\ndesign work I've done for the Web is located at swrobotics.com. The\nteam doesn't seem to have a new designer, so I think the site will\nstay as-is for a while.\nMy experience with WordPress began in earnest only last October when I\nmoved my blog (technobabbl.es) to WordPress, but as a Blogger user I\nexperimented with the software off and on with friends' sites since\nabout version 2.5.

Suggestions are welcome.\n\u003e\n\u003e I'll be happy to answer questions, point to resources etc for those who\n\u003e want to get involved. However, this is not the right place (yet, anyway) to\n\u003e come if you are just getting started and want to learn the design/UX trade\n\u003e as a new career move or something. I'd like to start off with more\n\u003e experienced UI/UX people just to get some processes nailed down.

John already mentioned\n\u003e two good ways of cleaning it up and this plugin\n\u003e http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/white-label-cms/ would certainly take\n\u003e care of the rest. I don't think the option to theme the admin area is the\n\u003e best one either, even though I *love* to theme virtually anything I can get\n\u003e my hands on -- some things are better left alone to retain simplicity.\n\u003e\n\u003e Here's just one scenario of how this could go south very quickly: A\n\u003e designer decides to fully rebrand, redesign the backend and revert to a\n\u003e horizontal menu a la WP 2.0, at her client's request. She decides to bail\n\u003e the site/maintenance after a year or two and the menu is all out of whack,\n\u003e come the next upgrade. Now, the client has a funky menu and it's all\n\u003e WordPress' fault. The client could just get rid of the custom admin theme\n\u003e altogether, but that would mean having to re-learn to the navigation. Again,\n\u003e it's all WordPress' fault. Well, not really... but you get what I mean. This\n\u003e is typically how a CMS gets pounded on.\n\u003e\n\u003e Mike\n\u003e\n\u003e On 6/3/2010 3:08 PM, Toon Van de Putte wrote:\n\u003e\n\u003e Is all of this well documented?

    "body": "Hi everyone.\n#wordpress-ui chats. Since not too many people indicated time  \nrestrictions, I'm going to go ahead and set the official weekly chat  \ntime as 2pm Eastern time on Thursdays starting next week, which won't  \ninterfere with anyone participating in the WordPress Dev, BuddyPress  \nor bbPress weekly IRC chats. I'm picking this time because if anything  \nurgent comes up, I can roll it into the dev chat later that day for  \ndev feedback. That's at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-ui.\nP2. There will be a blog, but since far more coders than interaction  \ndesigners responded to the introductions post here, I'm waiting to  \nlaunch the site until people sign up for the first couple of  \nwireframing projects so I'll know how many people are actually  \nparticipating. I don't think forums in addition to a P2 would be  \nuseful right now, since threading will be important in following  \nconversations.\nChallenge #1: Right Now module on Dashboard. The Right Now module is  \npretty, but somewhat misleading. People get confused about which  \npieces of information relate to each other because of the lines and  \npositioning. It evolved from the previous Right Now in 2.5, which was  \nsentence style. The list format of the current Right Now is much  \nbetter for translation, so we do not want to go back to sentence  \nstyle. The first challenge is to reconfigure the information in the  \nRight Now box (and/or re-evaluate what information belongs there) to  \nbe clearer, and wireframe a replacement design. Wireframes should be  \nsubmitted by next Wednesday night so they can be discussed in  \nThursday's chat. Where/how to submit wireframes will be posted on  \nMonday, as i need to work out some upload permissions first. Ideally  \npeople will work together and submit joint wireframes rather than  \neveryone submitting their own.\nChallenge #2: Better menu management. Right now the core development  \ncrew is working on a way to manage site menus from the admin. They  \nstarted from existing plugins and widget code, and as a result, it  \ncould use some UI help. I don't want people to start from scratch and  \nsubmit their dream model, because there's already work in progress.  \nJust drop by the Trac ticket and provide UI feedback/suggestions. http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11817 \n  No timeline here, this one will be ongoing until freeze.\nUpcoming Challenges: We're starting out with small things on purpose,  \nas has been discussed before. As this process becomes more solid,  \nwe'll move on to bigger UI things like the Plugins screen, the  \nComments screen, and the Settings area. People who prove to be  \ncollaborative and helpful will have opportunities to lead these mini- \nprojects, so please be nice to everyone and try to work together  \nrather than competing.\nThanks,\njane\nA footnote:\nWe're trying to create ways for interaction designers, information  \narchitects and graphic designers to contribute to core, in more  \nmeaningful ways than an occasional design contest. It will take some  \ntime to iron out the best ways for it to work, as there are other  \nthings of high priority being worked on at the same time (3.0 merge,  \nanyone?). Anyone who likes things to be already worked out perfectly  \nshould really unsubscribe and check in again in a couple of months  \nafter all the infrastructure is up, a few design challenges are out of  \nthe way, and we're settling into a productive routine. If you wouldn't  \ngo work for a startup, then you might want to hold off on the UI list.  \nAlso, there's been a lot of traffic on the list suddenly about why  \nthis isn't a forum, etc., but as I look at the posters, I'm seeing a  \nlot of coders rather than people who make wireframes and comps, which  \nis, if everyone would remember, the point of this list. If we wind up  \nwith the kind of griping that keeps popping up on wp-hackers, it won't  \nbe useful, so please keep posts to UX and design issues. Thanks. There  \nwill be a web site going up soon, but it's part of a slightly larger  \neffort, so in the meantime this list is where communication about  \ndesign challenges will happen officially, or in the #wordpress-ui  \nchannel, though IRC is better for real-time collaboration that ongoing  \nbrainstorming.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-ui/attachments/20100128/4326778f/attachment.htm\u003e",

    "body": "Greetings all!\nMy name is Neil Petrunia. I live in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and run a  \nsmall design/production house here. I have also been a sessional  \ninstructor in the Design program at the Alberta College of Art +  \nDesign (ACAD).\nI admit to being a relative newcomer to WordPress, but I am fast  \nbecoming evangelical about the potential this app has for bringing  \nabout a paradigm shift in web usability. Many of my students are  \ninterested in having their own websites, but are hugely intimidated by  \nthe prospect of building a site from scratch, then having to populate  \nit with portfolio material. Additionally, they have a hard time  \nunderstanding why it isn't enough to just 'throw it out there' and  \nthen wait for some undetermined response. Thinking of WP as not so  \nmuch a blogging tool, but as a CMS/networking tool gives them a way to  \nsee the push-pull nature of the program.\nI see WP as the CMS tool they have been waiting for, as it gives those  \nwho are moderately versed in CSS and PHP a tool to set up a quickly  \ninteractive portfolio/catalog site. I'm probably going to be a lurker  \nuntil I figure out what I can offer, but I will say that since I work  \non visual design projects for a living, I'll help with anything I can  \noffer in the way of visual commentary.\nI also have experience writing technical documentation, so can offer  \nthose skills as an editor/writer if the need arises. I'm good at  \nplaying the 'monkey in front of the keyboard', and can do usability  \ntesting. If it can be broken, I can break it, then describe what I did  \nto break it. (g)\nCheers!\nNeil",

I started off running an online e-commerce shop\nfor my father, moved over to doing research and consulting on website\nmarketing and eventually settled down on web design and development.  I am\nin the process of starting a Web Design and Development firm.  You can see\nmy (not quite ready to go live) site here:\nhttp://www.strategywebdesigns.com/ (btw, the site is, of course, done in\nWordpress).\nI don't usually do the designs myself, but rather oversee the projects\nworking with a variety of designers and developers.  I can work with those\ndesigners (and, if needbe, developers) for work on this project as well as\noffer my own insights and opinions (for whatever they are worth).\nIn terms of the scope of this group - I must admit that my initial interest\nwas in continuing the work done in Wordpress 2.7.  While I think it was a\nmajor step forward, it still doesn't meet my needs.  I use Wordpress as a\nCMS and I find the present design limiting in that aspect.  I have put a lot\nof thought into how to improve upon the design in that regard and would love\nto work on that.\nWith that said, I definitely understand the points mentioned earlier about\nthe fact that this group is just starting out and that there are already a\nlot of major changes planned for 3.0.  I still think, though, that the group\nshould be open in the relatively new future to the fact that there may be\nmany users of Wordpress who would like to see further improvements to the\ngeneral UI.\nFor now, though, I'm willing to hear what is on the plate for the near\nfuture and to see how I can be of assistance.\nAll the best,\nMoshe\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-ui/attachments/20100119/7489f141/attachment.htm\u003e",
