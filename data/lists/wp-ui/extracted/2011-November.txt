------
I just sent this out to the WP-Hackers list so I apologize if this gets doubled.  I am not sure which list this discussion should take place on and I wasn't away this list existed.
------
I am not sure if this is the correct list for this but I have an idea that would be REALLY helpful to the review system for plugins (and probably themes too).  One of the things I have noticed is that while tons of people download and try plugins the feedback mechanism for coming back and putting a start-review is poor.  Most users, when the plugin works correctly, simply never come back to add their vote.  I was wondering if WP put a star system right on the 'Installed Plugins' page if more people would use it.  This would be similar to how the Apple review system works.  Another option would be if someone has had a plugin installed for X days they would get a reminder message to review or vote on the plugin.  

I just feel like some system to encourage and promote rating plugins directly from the back-end of WP would be a great deal of help to everyone.  I know this isn't something that would happen quickly but I am just throwing it out there to see if anyone else has thoughts on this.

I like your thinking, Ryan. I think it would be great to give star rating
to plugins right on the installed plugin list, and maybe some feedback.
Though, keep in mind not all plugins can be installed from the wordpress
repositories. Some are paid for and manual install only and might not want
ratings.

Perhaps a simple "rate it" link with a hover over for star rating. the rate
it link would only appear if the plugin was present in an official
wordpress repo.

thoughts on that?

Intersting idea Ryan, but I have over 160 clients on WordPress who would be pissed with constant reminders to rate their plugins, so that part wouldn't be able to fly in my eyes.

Some of my clients that use the WPMU.org plugins get angry when they're constantly told about new things they don't care about.

I would think it would be pretty easy to tell Repo bound Plugins from the others.  Just like the update system can pull from the repo.  While you could create an API so outside plugins could use the star rating system I don't see the necessity.  

As far as putting a message to rate the plugin I agree with everyone that that is annoying.  I just figured I would mention it to throw it out there.  The addition of a small 'Rate Me', or 'star-rating' on the Installed plugin page, I would think, wouldn't annoy anybody.  It could definitely be included in a subtle and non-intrusive way.

It would seem that a "turn plugins ratings off option" could be put into the WP general options page. Then if plugin writers want to play the game there is social pressure for them to play the game. But if the user wants to view the option as "noise" they can customize their user experience. 'cause really the user only needs to see this once. After they have rated it then there is no reason to see it again. (unless the user is trying out a few plugins and comparing them). I did also recently see a plugin which allows a user to input a note about the plugin. I used this to keep a note as to why a plugin was active. keeping a reminder of how it fit into my over all site plan.
