*Apologies for Cross-posting*

 

Hello!

 

To introduce
myself again: My name is Kristina Krause and I am a masters student in social
anthropology at the University of Canterbury in Kent conducting a study on
client-web designer relationships in the nonprofit sector. I am currently
seeking web designers and nonprofits who utilize Wordpress.org and who would be
willing to be interviewed.


The goal of this project is to better understand the ways in
which technology can become more sustainable for nonprofit clients by examining
how nonprofits interact both with web designers and website technology, or in
this case: Wordpress.  

 

As part of my research I would like to conduct two
interviews with participating web designers and nonprofits. The first interview
being very open-ended and involving a general discussion of the web design
process and the second more structured with questions evolving from the first. 

 

I would be incredibly grateful if participants could provide
me with 1 hour of their time on two separate occasions to conduct these
interviews. If you are based in England, relatively near Canterbury or London,
I would love to meet you in person. If you are located elsewhere, a phone
interview would be fantastic. 

 

Also, I prefer to film or record the interviews, dependent
on the interview location and to take one photograph of the interviewee to
attach to the transcript. If there is discomfort with any (or all) of these
methods, please do let me know. Interviewees of course have complete control
over all resulting information, and I can use a pseudonym if preferred. 

 

Finally, I would like to offer nonprofits in exchange to
answer any website related questions or to complete any minor updates if your
organization is in need. 

 

For web designers, I hope that my research will be a helpful
resource for you and an opportunity to reflect on your own workflow!

 

Thank you for taking the time to read my request, and any
further questions are welcome!

Please contact me at this email address:  k_kristina_ at hotmail.com.

 

I have also posted my research proposal (in progress)
http://www.appliedanthrodesign.com/research/ if interested.

 

Thank you again,


Kristina

Iwould revert to the dark color or something between the two colors.

You could also use the color of the active menu item, the dark grey.

This light grey color is killing the interface.

Hi,

I would like to cooperate with your research, although I'm not sure I apply.
I am a web designer for a government-run educational magazine (www.klasse.be).
That means I'm employed by the Ministry of Education, which is not strictly
a 'non-profit'. Yet we do operate outside of regular market forces and as an
organisation have an independent status in which we set most of our own
priorities. Our websites do not add to any financial bottom line, but are
long-term projects aimed at information and education, they are at their
very core user-centred. We have one in-house web designer (me) and one web
developer who are responsible for anything we do online. In day-to-day
operations we operate a lot like a non-profit. We have very limited and
unflexible resources. The fact that we are an in-house web team largely has
to do with the difficulty for a small-scale government entity to outsource
web design/development and the desire to integrate the web and professional
online communications into Klasse's core business.
We have chosen Wordpress as a platform for the new version of our site for
parents (www.klasse.be/ouders) which is currently being developed, based on
the 3.0 beta.
I am available for an interview, but am not in the UK at the moment. I will
be on holiday in Kent in July, if that's any help.

I hope this helps. You are, in any case, always welcome to pay a visit to
our editing floor if you are interested in the project in general.

Kind regards,

Hi Toon,

 

Thank you for such a full response! I am very interested in scheduling an interview with you. Do let me check travel options, as I would not mind a chance to take a short trip to Brussels. Otherwise, would you be interested in a phone interview?

 

Also, do you think those in the organization involved in approving your design decisions etc. would be willing to chat with me as well?

 

On a side-note, your designs are fantastic!

 

Best,

Kristina

> I am a web designer for a government-run educational magazine (www.klasse.be). That means I'm employed by the Ministry of Education, which is not strictly a 'non-profit'. Yet we do operate outside of regular market forces and as an organisation have an independent status in which we set most of our own priorities. Our websites do not add to any financial bottom line, but are long-term projects aimed at information and education, they are at their very core user-centred. We have one in-house web designer (me) and one web developer who are responsible for anything we do online. In day-to-day operations we operate a lot like a non-profit. We have very limited and unflexible resources. The fact that we are an in-house web team largely has to do with the difficulty for a small-scale government entity to outsource web design/development and the desire to integrate the web and professional online communications into Klasse's core business.
> We have chosen Wordpress as a platform for the new version of our site for parents (www.klasse.be/ouders) which is currently being developed, based on the 3.0 beta.
> I am available for an interview, but am not in the UK at the moment. I will be on holiday in Kent in July, if that's any help.

> I hope this helps. You are, in any case, always welcome to pay a visit to our editing floor if you are interested in the project in general.
