Hi everyone. Almost 300 people have signed up for this list, which was  
way more than I expected. I'm not sure how many of you are people who  
actually want to get involved and contribute to the UI/UX work that  
goes into making WordPress, vs. how many are developers or users who  
just want to keep up with what's going on or offer feedback on other  
people's design work, so I think the first thing this list should do  
is help everyone get to know who's here. Lurkers need not do this, but  
if you're planning to contribute to the UI work ahead, please email  
this list and tell us a little bit about you: Your work background/ 
current job, specific design/usability/accessibility skills/talents  
that we should know about/make use of, what you hope to contribute to  
WP UI, your location/time zone, and maybe the one UI thing you would  
like to address in WP if given the chance. My main goal here is to  
find out how many people of all the subscribers are actually people  
who can wireframe, make comps, run usability testing, etc, vs. simply  
wanting to weigh in with opinions on the work of others (which can  
happen on Trac tickets). This list is meant to be a working group.

After people have had a day or two to introduce themselves, we'll have  
a better idea of how many people are actually planning to participate  
in this list for now, and can plan accordingly. I've got a list as  
long as my arm of potential design projects we can divvy up into  
groups, so knowing people's backgrounds and interests will help  
determine which projects we hit first. We can also then decide on a  
day/time for a weekly UI chat in IRC.

I'm in the process of setting up a site for this group to use a la  
wpdevel.wordpress.com, and will start adding people as authors once we  
have created teams and begun working on projects and there are things  
to report. I'll need to know your wordpress.org login name to add you  
to the site. Usability people are welcome and encouraged to speak up  
also, not just designers. Getting the plan up and running for  
distributed testing is on the goals list, too.

I guess I'll start. I'm Jane, and am the main UX person for WordPress.  
I led the admin redesign of 2.7, and work closely with the core team  
on UI changes. We never have time to get to everything, so there's  
still a ton left to do. I work for Automattic, which donates a big  
chunk of my time to the open source project. Before this job, I'd  
worked at agencies, companies and research groups in almost every  
front-end web job there is over the last 10 years. Though mostly UX  
stuff, I've also done project management, content development, HTML,  
visual design, testing, etc. Right now I'm a bottleneck for UI changes  
in WordPress, and anyone who works in this industry knows that it  
takes a lot longer to create a wireframe deck than it does to sketch  
an idea, so I'm hoping to grow this group into a healthy contributor  
community so that I can step back into more of a advisory/curatorial  
role rather than slowing things down while I draft wireframes or  
conduct individual testing sessions. I'm on the east coast, and would  
love it if the weekly chat could be during the day sometime before  
3pm, but if the majority needs to have an evening meeting instead, I  
can work with that. I traditionally do wireframes in Omnigraffle, but  
would like to find a good open source tool (the ones I've tried  
haven't been great) that we can all use for this if possible. I  
generally go for Photoshop for comps, and have not found GIMP to be an  
adequate substitute, though I'd love to move visual design to open  
source tools as well. Suggestions are welcome.

I'll be happy to answer questions, point to resources etc for those  
who want to get involved. However, this is not the right place (yet,  
anyway) to come if you are just getting started and want to learn the  
design/UX trade as a new career move or something. I'd like to start  
off with more experienced UI/UX people just to get some processes  
nailed down. I hope that in the future the WP UI group will be an  
awesome place to come to learn new skills.

Who's next?
Jane

Hello Jane / Everybody,

My name is Michael Soriano - Im a front end web developer and blogger. I'm
not sure how much I can contribute to redesigning the world's most popular
blogging platform - but I am very anxious to give it a shot. Note that I
think the existing admin is very well thought off, organized and well
crafted as it is already - but if we can make it better, why not.

I specialize in CSS, some jQuery and mild PHP. My personal blog is
http://fearlessflyer.com where I give away free wordpress themes.

Michael Soriano

Before anyone takes this statement and runs with it: we're not  
redesigning WordPress. We're just going to be touching up some of the  
screens that haven't been properly finished yet. The general layout  
and navigational structure is not up for redesign.

In honesty Jane, that's a bit disappointing. There are quite a few areas of
the WP UI that would benefit from a drastic rethink and I'd imagine many
people on the list would be more than happy to take up that challenge,
myself included, is there any real reason why we're being restricted to
simply "touching up" the areas which aren't yet properly finished?

I'd imagine, given a little freedom, we'd probably see some enhancements to
the general user-experience and aesthetic of Wordpress, that reflect
everyones needs a lot more than it does at the moment.

Hi Jane,

My name is Mark Kellie

I'm an interface designer and work for a financial spread betting company. I design user interfaces for websites, dealing platforms, online banners, microsites etc.

My main skill is design and secondly solving user journey problems.

Would be happy to help develop these parts of wordpress that haven't had much attention. I don't have a million hours to dedicate but would definitely be keen to be part of the team and I'm sure I'll be able to contribute.

Based in London UK.

Thanks

Mark

Hi Chris. When I say the general layout and structure isn't up for  
being redesigned right now, I mean the basic framing of the left nav,  
modular elements, etc. Various sections will be "redesigned," such as  
Settings, Site Admin from MU, and the media uploader. Also, some  
screens will be redesigned, like Comments and Plugins. However, as  
long as they still live within the general WP UI, I don't consider  
that a major redesign. Matt declared last year that we would be  
sticking with the 2.7 design for at least the next few years, having  
undergone several backend redesigns in a short time period before. So  
*pieces* will be redesigned, but we're not "redesigning the admin,"  a  
phrase that will freak people out because it means changing  
everything, not just making what's there better.

And yes, there is a reason to restrict this project at first to the  
touchups... not only is this a new process for contributing to the  
design of the UI, but we're in the middle of merging two codebases.  
There are significant UI issues that need to be fixed as part of this  
process. Doing a "drastic rethink" of the backend UI just isn't on the  
table at this time. Just as the contributing developers work within a  
scope for each release, so will contributing designers.

Hi Jane,

I run a business that uses WP (as well as Drupal) extensively. We place a
great deal of emphasis on UI and UX, and I'd be happy to contribute

I'm Matt Thomas (aka "MT"). I'm the art director at Automattic where I, like Jane, spend a portion of my time working on WordPress core. I also spend my time on WordPress.com and Automattic's other services. I worked with Jane after the big "Crazyhorse" redesign to create a new visual style for the WordPress UI, which was implemented by the core devs in version 2.7. But that redesign only touched the topmost elements in the interface. While I think the last thing WordPress users want is yet another redesign, there's tons of things in the interface that haven't had much thoughtful attention paid to its design, and I'm excited to see what we can come up with to solve those problems and make WordPress even better.

I'm Gordon Brander,
I'm a UI designer and front-end developer at Crowd Favorite <http://crowdfavorite.com>. I'm based in beautiful Colorado. 

A handful of things I've worked on:

- Lead front-end dev for the Carrington Theme framework.
- Lead designer/front-end dev for the WP Mobile plugin.
- Tweaked the blue admin color scheme for the WP 2.7 release.
- Lead front-end dev on numerous projects for large companies, some of which get 1 million + uniques per day.

I have a well-rounded knowledge of the design process, from wireframing to comps to implementation. On the implementation side of things, I'm proficient with CSS and cross-browser issues, accessibility, markup semantics, and Microformats.

I would really like to work on:
- Streamlining the UI for Post Thumbnails.
- Revising the Site Admin panel (MU) design hierarchy to reflect the actual hierarchy of the application. This is an issue we did some initial design exploration on in late in 2009, and I would love to pursue it further.

Hi, I'm Ben Dunkle. I live right outside of Buffalo, NY, and teach design
full-time at Canisius College. I was a winner of the icon design contest
and created the default set of icons that appear in the admin section of
wordpress. Since then, I've done minor things like fix up the favicon and
the loading/spinny thing you see when wordpress is processing stuff. I've
also designed admin icons for plugin authors.
I can help out with any "chromey" stuff?additional icons, visual aids,
graphical enhancements/tabs/buttons/etc. I'd say admin sidebar/toolbar
could be better. Sometimes plugins appear in tools, settings, or all by
themselves.

Hi,
my name is Norman Paschke, I'm a 22 year old guy from Germany and I'm a 
Frontend Developer in a local firm. In my free time I'm working with CSS 
and jQuery and on WordPress Themes.
You can find my blog at www.normansblog.de
Since I started using WordPress for blogging, I was fanscinated how easy 
yet effective it is to use (even as a CMS).
I really hope I can help to improve WordPress in any way you think it 
needs improvement :)

Greetings,

Norman

HI All,

I'm Joel Goodman. Currently I'm a designer/front end developer/web marketer
in Higher Education, located about 45 miles East of St. Louis, MO (Central
Time). I also freelance and build out most of my projects in WordPress (both
.org and MU). WPMU gets rolled out a lot at the college I work at as do .org
installs and I am the main designer/support/developer for all of them.

I do a lot of training for people who don't know much about using the web
and thus focus a lot of my time on explaining backend UX and [trying, most
of the time] getting non-technical people to understand workflows or even
simple WYSIWYG editors. So I keep my eye on UI issues and come up with
solutions where I can.

I do more interface and layout design than I do icons/logo/branding, so I
think I'll be especially adept to contributing here.

Happy to help design, tweak, suggest layout. WP has done a ton for me and
I'd like to offer any assistance I can muster in this. Glad to meet you all!

I'm No?l Jackson. I'm a designer at Automattic and I also (like Jane and MT) work on WordPress core from time to time. I love Press This and want it to become even better. It's something I've worked on a bit more than other things in WordPress. I'm a Photoshop guru, JavaScript hacker, and have had several dreams in HTML. 

I'm at http://noel.io and I'm extremely excited about this new list and what is to come.

Hi All,

My name is Gaston and I'm a web designer located in Oregon.  I'm also full
time project manager at a software security company.

I can help from a UX/UI perspective but I also have considerable experience
writing user documentation, managing user testing, gathering requirements,
and developing and delivering training.  I can translate docs to Spanish if
needed.

I'm very excited to be part of this team and would love to help in any way I
can.

Thanks,
Gaston

Hello,

My name is Alex Koti, I live in Sao Paulo, Brazil (UTC-3), and Im freelancer
front end developer.

I use Wordpress as a CMS for several projects, creating plugins and options
pages. A big concern of mine is to let the admin of WordPress is well
understood by people who will do just simple tasks or are not intimate with
the admin elements. Another interest is to provide a more comprehensive
visual pattern of form elements[design and code], which can be reused in
plugins, widgets, meta boxes and options pages.

Hello,

My name is Moshe Morris.  I started off running an online e-commerce shop
for my father, moved over to doing research and consulting on website
marketing and eventually settled down on web design and development.  I am
in the process of starting a Web Design and Development firm.  You can see
my (not quite ready to go live) site here:
http://www.strategywebdesigns.com/ (btw, the site is, of course, done in
Wordpress).

I don't usually do the designs myself, but rather oversee the projects
working with a variety of designers and developers.  I can work with those
designers (and, if needbe, developers) for work on this project as well as
offer my own insights and opinions (for whatever they are worth).

In terms of the scope of this group - I must admit that my initial interest
was in continuing the work done in Wordpress 2.7.  While I think it was a
major step forward, it still doesn't meet my needs.  I use Wordpress as a
CMS and I find the present design limiting in that aspect.  I have put a lot
of thought into how to improve upon the design in that regard and would love
to work on that.

With that said, I definitely understand the points mentioned earlier about
the fact that this group is just starting out and that there are already a
lot of major changes planned for 3.0.  I still think, though, that the group
should be open in the relatively new future to the fact that there may be
many users of Wordpress who would like to see further improvements to the
general UI.

For now, though, I'm willing to hear what is on the plate for the near
future and to see how I can be of assistance.

All the best,

Moshe

I'm TJ Mullinax, news producer at the Yakima Herald-Republic where I have my hand in nearly every portion of publishing news in central Washington.  I am also the primary UI designer behind our custom Web CMS, Depot Central (Ruby on Rails), depotcentral.org that runs yakimaherald.com as well as the union-bulletin.com. I am currently creating the next CMS UI wireframe in Creately, with mocup docs in InDesign and graphics in Illustrator and Photoshop.  I have been working with WP for years (and many of our special publications and sports site continue to use it) and am currently creating a judging system for the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) for the quarterly video clip contest run within a customized WP UI theme. This will probably be my 15th site that I have set up that runs on WP or MU. I would prefer seeing improvements to the media management interfaces and extensibility for theme developers as well as integrating tools/menus to better control content for mobile display. 
-TJ
 


I'm Matt Thomas (aka "MT"). I'm the art director at Automattic where I, like Jane, spend a portion of my time working on WordPress core. I also spend my time on WordPress.com and Automattic's other services. I worked with Jane after the big "Crazyhorse" redesign to create a new visual style for the WordPress UI, which was implemented by the core devs in version 2.7. But that redesign only touched the topmost elements in the interface. While I think the last thing WordPress users want is yet another redesign, there's tons of things in the interface that haven't had much thoughtful attention paid to its design, and I'm excited to see what we can come up with to solve those problems and make WordPress even better.

Hello All,

My name is Patrick Carey. I work as a front end developer/ project  
lead/resident UI guy on WordPress projects at Teachers College at  
Columbia University in New York City, so East Coast based. We have a  
small team in the early stages of a big MU project, so I will be  
interested in MU issues going forward though glad to help in any way.

I am versed in XHTML and CSS , Jquery, intermediate PHP, I have  
assisted teaching graphic design in grad school and know my way around  
the Creative Suite well.

Anyone going to WordCamp Boston? I will be there and maybe we can have  
an Un-conference session?

Jane and Co.,

Shane Froebel checking in!

Location: Long Island, NY, USA

I work with the WordPress development team and also being a core
contributor to the code (no commit). My background is mostly in PHP,
CSS, and XHTML. I am however pretty bad at designing something, but once
it's built, I can help code it.

My contribution will be in those skills sets above and testing the
interface and commenting on wireframes/mockups for refinement before
they get to a final design structure.

I usually hang out in #WordPress-dev, but not idling in #wordpress-ui.

My personal site is the only thing I really done that is published. I do
work another FT job and it's hard for me to be as active as I want to
be, but I do have goals to do this FT with the community that I grown to
be a part of.

That's about it! Talk to you all very soon!

P.S. 300... wow.

Your Friend, Shane

Hi!

First of all, please apologize my English! My name is Viktor F. 
Castellanos, I'm a Multimedia Designer located in Tarragona (Spain). I 
have experience in setting WP and WPMU as a general CMS for non-common 
uses (like using it as content motor for online games), designing themes 
from scratch and UI plugin integration. I can help with usability and 
accesibility ideas to improve design, and any Photoshop, Illustrator or 
XHTML/CSS skills need. I will love to collaborate, and *love* to learn 
with the community!

I'm Jess Planck Website Manager for Nicholls State University in way south Louisiana. Old school trained graphic designer dealing with web bits for almost 15 years, super lurker, and slightly skilled at avoiding hurricanes. I barely ever have time, but I occasionally try to make minor contributions. The portfolio is at http://funroe.net/portfolio/ when I'm not breaking things.

So glad Jane made that statement and the follow-up. Good example is probably the header UI that Jane and Matt T. discussed last year. I'm sure it's going to make sense now that the WPMU merge has begun.

Hello all,

My name is Kenny Younger. I am a database and web developer based out of Des
Moines, IA (Central Time Zone). I have worked in the web development arena
for about 8 years, with a short stint off for about 2-3 years where I
focused my efforts in enterprise database development. A year ago I left
that firm and started my own company, and since then have re-realized my
passion for web development. Played a bit of catch-up in the technologies
over the past year, where I found and fell in love with WordPress and its
terrific community. I have used it in pretty much all my client's websites.
I will be attending WordCamp Chicago this year, and intend on running one
out here in Iowa in the near future.

I have decent server-side and client-side development skills, but find
myself enjoying the UI/UX side more. So I figured why not cut my teeth as a
WordPress contributor with this endeavor and help the community that I feel
I already owe so much to. I do feel one of my strong suits that grows from
all my report design experience is a keen eye for formatting large sets of
data for ease of use, so perhaps that might help with the divvying up that
Jane intends to do. I know my way around the basics of Photoshop and like
Balsamiq for wireframing. I also like to think that I write decent copy when
so inspired.

So this is me officially throwing my hat into the ring, and I intend to help
when and where I can. However, I'll never over-commit myself, and understand
that a lot of the time "no" is the best answer.

Eager to meet the rest or you.
-Kenny

From: neilpet at shaw.ca (Neil Petrunia)
Date: Tue, 19 Jan 2010 14:01:30 -0700
Subject: [wp-ui] Introduction
Message-ID: <AB76A124-10ED-4A88-A8B2-C57E89F24C26@shaw.ca>

Greetings all!

My name is Neil Petrunia. I live in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and run a  
small design/production house here. I have also been a sessional  
instructor in the Design program at the Alberta College of Art +  
Design (ACAD).

I admit to being a relative newcomer to WordPress, but I am fast  
becoming evangelical about the potential this app has for bringing  
about a paradigm shift in web usability. Many of my students are  
interested in having their own websites, but are hugely intimidated by  
the prospect of building a site from scratch, then having to populate  
it with portfolio material. Additionally, they have a hard time  
understanding why it isn't enough to just 'throw it out there' and  
then wait for some undetermined response. Thinking of WP as not so  
much a blogging tool, but as a CMS/networking tool gives them a way to  
see the push-pull nature of the program.

I see WP as the CMS tool they have been waiting for, as it gives those  
who are moderately versed in CSS and PHP a tool to set up a quickly  
interactive portfolio/catalog site. I'm probably going to be a lurker  
until I figure out what I can offer, but I will say that since I work  
on visual design projects for a living, I'll help with anything I can  
offer in the way of visual commentary.

I also have experience writing technical documentation, so can offer  
those skills as an editor/writer if the need arises. I'm good at  
playing the 'monkey in front of the keyboard', and can do usability  
testing. If it can be broken, I can break it, then describe what I did  
to break it. (g)

Cheers!

Wow, I leave for two meetings and my inbox EXPLODES with UI emails - sweet!

My name is Mitch Canter, and I am a wordpress designer / developer from
Franklin, TN.  I work out of my house designing websites built on WordPress
for everyone from small to medium sized businesses to world famous bloggers,
so to speak.  I want to get involved with the UI design because, frankly,
the actual developer stuff scares the heebie geebies outta me.  I'm a
designer first, and I think that's more of an area I can actually contribute
intelligently to.

As far as what I hope to actually do, I consider myself a pretty good judge
of usability and wireframes, and I try to keep the bells and whistles subtle
and focus on content as king when I actually do sites for people, so
whatever you want me to do, let me know and I'll see what I can help with.

~Mitch

Hi everyone. Almost 300 people have signed up for this list, which was  
way more than I expected. I'm not sure how many of you are people who  
actually want to get involved and contribute to the UI/UX work that  
goes into making WordPress, vs. how many are developers or users who  
just want to keep up with what's going on or offer feedback on other  
people's design work, so I think the first thing this list should do  
is help everyone get to know who's here. Lurkers need not do this, but  
if you're planning to contribute to the UI work ahead, please email  
this list and tell us a little bit about you: Your work background/ 
current job, specific design/usability/accessibility skills/talents  
that we should know about/make use of, what you hope to contribute to  
WP UI, your location/time zone, and maybe the one UI thing you would  
like to address in WP if given the chance. My main goal here is to  
find out how many people of all the subscribers are actually people  
who can wireframe, make comps, run usability testing, etc, vs. simply  
wanting to weigh in with opinions on the work of others (which can  
happen on Trac tickets). This list is meant to be a working group.

After people have had a day or two to introduce themselves, we'll have  
a better idea of how many people are actually planning to participate  
in this list for now, and can plan accordingly. I've got a list as  
long as my arm of potential design projects we can divvy up into  
groups, so knowing people's backgrounds and interests will help  
determine which projects we hit first. We can also then decide on a  
day/time for a weekly UI chat in IRC.

I'm in the process of setting up a site for this group to use a la  
wpdevel.wordpress.com, and will start adding people as authors once we  
have created teams and begun working on projects and there are things  
to report. I'll need to know your wordpress.org login name to add you  
to the site. Usability people are welcome and encouraged to speak up  
also, not just designers. Getting the plan up and running for  
distributed testing is on the goals list, too.

I guess I'll start. I'm Jane, and am the main UX person for WordPress.  
I led the admin redesign of 2.7, and work closely with the core team  
on UI changes. We never have time to get to everything, so there's  
still a ton left to do. I work for Automattic, which donates a big  
chunk of my time to the open source project. Before this job, I'd  
worked at agencies, companies and research groups in almost every  
front-end web job there is over the last 10 years. Though mostly UX  
stuff, I've also done project management, content development, HTML,  
visual design, testing, etc. Right now I'm a bottleneck for UI changes  
in WordPress, and anyone who works in this industry knows that it  
takes a lot longer to create a wireframe deck than it does to sketch  
an idea, so I'm hoping to grow this group into a healthy contributor  
community so that I can step back into more of a advisory/curatorial  
role rather than slowing things down while I draft wireframes or  
conduct individual testing sessions. I'm on the east coast, and would  
love it if the weekly chat could be during the day sometime before  
3pm, but if the majority needs to have an evening meeting instead, I  
can work with that. I traditionally do wireframes in Omnigraffle, but  
would like to find a good open source tool (the ones I've tried  
haven't been great) that we can all use for this if possible. I  
generally go for Photoshop for comps, and have not found GIMP to be an  
adequate substitute, though I'd love to move visual design to open  
source tools as well. Suggestions are welcome.

I'll be happy to answer questions, point to resources etc for those  
who want to get involved. However, this is not the right place (yet,  
anyway) to come if you are just getting started and want to learn the  
design/UX trade as a new career move or something. I'd like to start  
off with more experienced UI/UX people just to get some processes  
nailed down. I hope that in the future the WP UI group will be an  
awesome place to come to learn new skills.

Who's next?
Jane

Hello Jane, and my fellow WordPress fans!

My Name is Jeff Olson, I am Sr Art Director for HSN.com. SME for our UI /
Interaction design and a passion for UX. I am also the new Editor of Fuel
Your Interface (fuelyourinterface.com) part of the Fuel Brand Network of
sites. I have written on the subject of UX and UI as it pertains to
eCommerce for Smashing Magazine -
http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/23/designing-for-the-user-experience-in-ecommerce/and
written design tutorials for
PSD.TUTSPLUS.com <http://psd.tutsplus.com/>, Fuel Your Interface and Fuel
Your Creativity.

I too live on the East Coast and have been using WordPress for about 3 or 4
years. I'm more comfortable hand sketching wirefames, but am just as
proficient using OmniGraffle and Photoshop.

Currently working on Developing a much needed GUI Standards doc for HSN.com
and the creative mind behind a future look at video strategy, social, and
"user-flow" areas of the site.

I'd love to help out in anyway I can.

Thanks!

Hello;

Well, I'm going to mostly be a lurker around here.  I do some html, css 
and php coding but not much.  More in the way of hacking and fixing and 
converting things to my likes than actual coding.

However, I've been using WordPress on and off for several years now 
(around 10+).  I do have a Linux system at home I can test on, and 
plenty of free space on my paid hosting account to set up and run a few 
testing sites.

I'll just chime in once in a while when things either bug me or really 
peak my interest. And I'm willing to be a tester and allow the test site 
to be open either to the list or the public.

So, basically I will be the voice of the blog owner, writer and reader.

One note about me: I'm disabled, retired and diabetic.  Sometimes that 
makes me a bit cranky.  Please take that in mind in any posts I make.

Emil

hi Jane,

Thanks for the clarification, very good response :) I didn't realise there
was so much scope still left to have an impact on the project, it sounds
like we'll see some very strong ideas merging. As for an introduction, you
can find my portfolio at http://abstraktion.co.uk. I run the company from
Bristol, UK with my partner Rachel (we've just had our first baby girl at
Christmas). We've designed and built a number of projects on top of
Wordpress and have extensive experience in designing UI's for web and
desktop applications, so naturally this project's grabbed my interest.

Cheers!

Hi
I am Heike,
based in Wellington, New Zealand, (UTC +13),
I work as Business Analyst, User experience designer and Project  
Manager on contract base here in Wellington.

I am using WordPress since 1.5. I am using it as CMS and Blog Tool,  
with custom built themes.

I started my web career as a graphic and interaction designer about 13  
years ago . For the last 8 years I have worked as Business Analyst,  
User Experience Designer and Project Manager on a variety of projects  
in Germany, including online projects for corporations such as Siemens  
and BMW and and since 2,5 years for government and privat sector sites  
here in New Zealand.

I met Matt at the wordcamp 2009 in Wellington, always wanted to  
contribute to open source, so I thought this might be the right time.  
I can help with general UI and UX design, but I might be of use  
helping with the project management as well. I am reality proven and  
have no issues with working what is there. I am interested in media  
integration video and audio and rich text editing...

My last projects - These are all built on Drupal ;-):

NzSkillsConnect - ATTTO and HSI
URL: http://www.nzskillsconnect.co.nz/
Launch December 2009

New Zealand Police Association
URL: http://www.policeassn.org.nz/
Launch October 2009

Housing New Zealand Shared Equity scheme
URL: http://www.sharedequityscheme.co.nz/
Launch October 2008

That would be it from me,

Take care,

Heike

Hello Jane and everybody

I am arena, living in the suburb of Paris France and the happy developper of
the plugin MailPress.
I have a good knowledge in php, sql, (x)html, xml, jquery, javascript,
css...
I am a contributor on wordpress trac.
I am interested in the technical architecture of WordPress and admin UI
design (love the new design).
If my skills can be of any help, let me know.

One other problem of mine is a total lack of time-line sense.  I guess I 
overshot it again.  Yeah, I've lived in Alabama for 4 years now and 
started wordpress a few years before leaving Seattle.  It just seems 
longer. I could swear I used it at one job that I left 5 years before 
moving, but that would make it nine years ...

Emil

Note: It seems that all replies are set to go to the original poster 
rather than to the list.  Is that the way you want things set up?

Hi everyone!

I am Nile Flores. I am a web and graphic designer, as well as social media 
consultant from Southern Illinois. I have been using WordPress for 6 years, 
and before that b2. I usually deal a lot with PSD to WP conversions, HTML to 
WP conversions, and designing based on the clientele's needs. I also have a 
site WPAddict.net and I answer support questions from time to time in the 
WordPress Support forums and on the social networks. In my community, I have 
taught local business owners how to use WordPress, and even people just 
needing a website. I occasionally hold free classes at the local library. I 
do this because I never had the opportunity to learn what I have. And it 
really is an experience teaching people a little more than twice my 
age...lol, and rewarding that they take a lot away from the classes. A lot 
of people today are where I was at years ago, and I think it is a way to 
give back.

Developing side, I have created a few PHP scripts - PHPurl (short URL 
re-direct script), and PHPads (simple ad management script.) I have done 
other types of small php development projects for clients. It is not much. I 
hope I might have something to offer for WordPress. I get this shocked 
reaction when people realize I am a woman who develops... Jane... have you 
gotten that reaction?

I have been a beta tester for several scripts, sites, and platforms. And 
Jane... I agree, GIMP is not an adequate substitute. I carry both Adobe and 
Corel products, along with GIMP... which sits collecting dust. Corel 
acquired Jasc a few years ago, which has Paint Shop Pro. They integrated 
Jasc's product into their own product and made it better...imo. The tools is 
great and I believe a nice alternate replacement. I learned Jasc PSP first 
before Adobe PS...lol. (You can even take files and save to psd on PSP and 
work in PS. However... it is limited on some areas. I still like the 
program.)

I hope I am able to contribute to WP as it has done a lot for me on the UI 
end. As I get more comfortable hearing people hear, I am sure I will be 
chiming in from time to time.

Kind Regards,
Nile Flores

That is a good idea Jane.

I am Dre, you can find me at http://armeda.com and I am co-founder and 
the designer of http://wpvibe.com

I started designing in the 90's and have been around WordPress since 
2005. I am a regular in the #wordpress and #wordpress-dev IRC channels. 
I am really excited about all of this and have been anticipating great 
movement on the list and IRC since Jane announced last week.

I look forward to working with you all.

Cheers,

Hi everyone,

I'm Ryan McCue, and I'm mainly a PHP guy, though I, of course, do a lot 
of work with HTML/CSS. I'm located on the Gold Coast, in Australia (UTC+10).

I aim to try and contribute in the same way as Shane, that is, helping 
to translate ideas into code, though I can also contribute front-end 
code, such as CSS and HTML. I'm also very particular about spelling and 
grammar, so expect me to be checking any copy. :)

I usually hang out in the #wordpress-dev chat room, though I'm now 
idling in #wordpress-ui. Don't expect me to be too active though, mainly 
due to my timezone.

Previous work I've done is mainly on my own projects. I've designed and 
implemented the UI for a web feed reader I develop, and I've very 
recently redesigned a website for a gaming community.

I look forward to participating in the community.

(Also, to note, I think the list needs to be changed so the list's 
address is the default replyee (heh), like wp-hackers)

Hey Folks,

My name is Bruce Drummond. I'm a new media artist, designer, coder and
musician in my final semester in the MFA Design and Technology program at
Parsons the New School for Design in New York. I have a wide variety of
skills across many domains and 8+ years of industry experience. I use all
kinds of tools - including the command line - whatever is most efficient for
the task at hand.

I've been using Wordpress since Billy Strayhorn but most extensively in the
last 3 years, as a CMS for small to medium websites (Drupal in certain
cases). I do comps in Photoshop and wireframes in Omnigraffle/Illustrator
and more recently Pidoco <https://pidoco.com>.

I'm not sure how much time I can invest but I'll be thrilled to contribute!

My portfolio: http://portfolio.bruzed.com
My blog: http://www.bruzed.com

Cheers,
Bruce.

Hi everyone,

I'm Daniel, a brazilian guy living in Bangkok (UTC +7). I work with  XHTML, CSS, web design and a tiny bit about PHP. Even being working just for a couple of  years with this topic, I hope to be able to help to improve WP as much we can.

Hi everyone,

I'm Voyagerfan5761. I think I'm going to be somewhat out of place as
one of the few members not using my real name (I try to avoid that on
the Internet). My current plan is to contribute if I ever think I have
something to say; I don't want to be a lurker.

Anyway, I'm a student who will be entering college as a freshman in
the fall. Currently I live in Minnesota and operate on the Central
time zone, but that will change later when I move to school. Also, my
schedule is funky and doesn't conform to the work day, so I could be
catching up on reading this list or posting at any time of the day or
night.

My main expertise is with amateur design, though I have absolutely no
professional experience. I'm also going to (at least initially) be in
a technical theatre / theatre design program. But the biggest scratch
design work I've done for the Web is located at swrobotics.com. The
team doesn't seem to have a new designer, so I think the site will
stay as-is for a while.

My experience with WordPress began in earnest only last October when I
moved my blog (technobabbl.es) to WordPress, but as a Blogger user I
experimented with the software off and on with friends' sites since
about version 2.5. Jane, the new admin UI is really a lot more usable
than the old one; congratulations to you and your team! I hope I can
contribute even in some small measure to making it better-looking and
more usable.

On WordPress.org, I go by the rather predictable username of 'voyagerfan5761'.

Looking forward to the discussions!

Hi!

I'm Nitin Reddy and I'm a software developer with a firm in Dubai (GMT+0400). Although my day job involves primarily building applications on ASP.NET MVC, I develop with PHP too and build WordPress plugins. I have had to work with modified WordPress cores that I see novice developers do (and I've always moved all of what I saw into plugins), so I've picked up some experience working with the WP core. I've been working with WordPress as a blogging engine and CMS since version 2.6, so I guess that makes me relatively new to the scene.

I'd love to contribute to the UI/UX initiative and can help with (X)HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP development. I probably will not be in the IRC rooms during the meetups due to the timezone difference but I will be following the discussions through the mailing list.

-Nitin

Hi everyone. Almost 300 people have signed up for this list, which was
way more than I expected. I'm not sure how many of you are people who
actually want to get involved and contribute to the UI/UX work that
goes into making WordPress, vs. how many are developers or users who
just want to keep up with what's going on or offer feedback on other
people's design work, so I think the first thing this list should do
is help everyone get to know who's here. Lurkers need not do this, but
if you're planning to contribute to the UI work ahead, please email
this list and tell us a little bit about you: Your work background/
current job, specific design/usability/accessibility skills/talents
that we should know about/make use of, what you hope to contribute to
WP UI, your location/time zone, and maybe the one UI thing you would
like to address in WP if given the chance. My main goal here is to
find out how many people of all the subscribers are actually people
who can wireframe, make comps, run usability testing, etc, vs. simply
wanting to weigh in with opinions on the work of others (which can
happen on Trac tickets). This list is meant to be a working group.

After people have had a day or two to introduce themselves, we'll have
a better idea of how many people are actually planning to participate
in this list for now, and can plan accordingly. I've got a list as
long as my arm of potential design projects we can divvy up into
groups, so knowing people's backgrounds and interests will help
determine which projects we hit first. We can also then decide on a
day/time for a weekly UI chat in IRC.

I'm in the process of setting up a site for this group to use a la
wpdevel.wordpress.com, and will start adding people as authors once we
have created teams and begun working on projects and there are things
to report. I'll need to know your wordpress.org login name to add you
to the site. Usability people are welcome and encouraged to speak up
also, not just designers. Getting the plan up and running for
distributed testing is on the goals list, too.

I guess I'll start. I'm Jane, and am the main UX person for WordPress.
I led the admin redesign of 2.7, and work closely with the core team
on UI changes. We never have time to get to everything, so there's
still a ton left to do. I work for Automattic, which donates a big
chunk of my time to the open source project. Before this job, I'd
worked at agencies, companies and research groups in almost every
front-end web job there is over the last 10 years. Though mostly UX
stuff, I've also done project management, content development, HTML,
visual design, testing, etc. Right now I'm a bottleneck for UI changes
in WordPress, and anyone who works in this industry knows that it
takes a lot longer to create a wireframe deck than it does to sketch
an idea, so I'm hoping to grow this group into a healthy contributor
community so that I can step back into more of a advisory/curatorial
role rather than slowing things down while I draft wireframes or
conduct individual testing sessions. I'm on the east coast, and would
love it if the weekly chat could be during the day sometime before
3pm, but if the majority needs to have an evening meeting instead, I
can work with that. I traditionally do wireframes in Omnigraffle, but
would like to find a good open source tool (the ones I've tried
haven't been great) that we can all use for this if possible. I
generally go for Photoshop for comps, and have not found GIMP to be an
adequate substitute, though I'd love to move visual design to open
source tools as well. Suggestions are welcome.

I'll be happy to answer questions, point to resources etc for those
who want to get involved. However, this is not the right place (yet,
anyway) to come if you are just getting started and want to learn the
design/UX trade as a new career move or something. I'd like to start
off with more experienced UI/UX people just to get some processes
nailed down. I hope that in the future the WP UI group will be an
awesome place to come to learn new skills.

Who's next?
Jane

hi Jane and everybody,

I am Thomas from Freiburg, Germany. I have been developing and maintaining websites for grassroots-organisations, non-profits and small NGOs for the last 5 years, at first using Mac-software like WebDesign, Sandvox and the like.

Since 2 1/2 years I am changing all these sites to be WordPress based and startet to train people from the organizations to write content for and maintain the sites themselves, to make them less dependent on me and to save me from to many phone calls.

In this process I have many times wished the WP-UI was more consistent and easier comprehendible.

I am on this list to contribute suggestions here and there and mainly to test the solutions you come up with and introduce them to my trainees and report their reactions/feedback.

I am astounded and excited by the huge number of experienced designers who show up here. I look forward to a very interesting community process.

Hello everybody,

my name is Dusan Kosour and I'm from the Czech republic in Europe.
I?m not a designer nor developer, my skills are in SVG graphics, logos, typography, bitmap to vector tracing, stock photography, product photography, HDR photography.
Of course, I can also work as a user tester :o)

Best regards, Dusan.

Dear Friends,


My name is Ronen (http://www.iamronen.com) and I live in the north of 
Israel in a small village called Elkosh 
http://www.iamronen.com/2009/03/elkosh/.


3+ years ago I left behind a 15 year information technology career in 
which I specialized in systems analysis, management and the last two 
years were dedicated to digital product design. I am a Yoga practitioner 
and teacher and I play Shakuhachi 
http://www.iamronen.com/2009/04/sounds-of-shakuhachi/. Since my break 
from the business of technology I have immersed myself as a photographer 
in an artistic exploration with improvisation performance artists 
(http://www.stillcreation.com). I am currently involved in numerous 
self-initiated projects and rarely work commercially.


I encountered WordPress ~3 years ago and have enjoyed it greatly both 
for expressing myself and for enabling others to communicate with the 
world. I have since moved to using mostly open-source solutions and have 
great respect for the people leading in this direction. I have been 
looking for a way to give back to open-source by contributing my product 
design skills. I have recently begun interacting with the Mozilla 
Raindrop team and am now looking forward to partaking in this new 
WordPress process.


For me product design is a process of choosing and pursuing a purpose 
(for a product) with care. Though I can contribute on the UI/UX level my 
patience for these details is limited - I believe that too much noodling 
around with these details can be a sign of lack of direction and is 
often done at the expense of actions that have a higher leverage and 
more impact on the product. I feel that **as an end-user product** 
WordPress has been making little and insignificant progress since 2.7.


I have two distinct purposes in mind for WordPress. One is a REALLY 
simple blogging platform (in the direction Tumblr is heading) that 
anyone can use. The other is an open-source substitute for Facebook - an 
application that every-day-non-blogger people can use to store, 
communicate and socialize with other people online. I would love for 
WordPress to reach many more people then it currently does. I believe 
that inevitably most people will have (many already do) an online 
presence - I prefer that that presence be established on open-source 
software and self-owned solutions (I collect my thoughts and resources 
on this issue at: http://www.iamronen.com/ontekusuto/).


I feel that WordPress is still waaaay too technical and addresses mostly 
needs of technically-minded people. I believe one of the core reasons 
for this is that, like all the other open-source projects I have 
encountered, it is dominated and led by developers.Therefore, I believe 
this effort to bring designers into the process is a wonderful 
undertaking and has the potential to break new grounds for open-source 
software (which generally suffers from poor product design). I am not 
pleased to find that it will be limited to narrow UI perspective - but 
maybe that is an inevitable starting point - time will tell! I believe 
WordPress deserves not only better GUI/UI but also an open high-level 
discussion of where it is headed - a discussion about purpose.


Thank you Jane & Automattic for initiating this process.
All Things Good

Ronen

Hello, My name is Tom Shue. I live in Las Vegas. I am new to word press and really like what I have seen. First off I am a freelance graphic artist that specializes in 3d motion graphics. I have been designing web projects for over 10 years. I use html, css, php,msql, javascript, what ever it takes to archive an end result. I am one that who sees from an artistic eye first and coding isnt my first love, but I can hold my own.  
I mainly use C4D, After Effects and Photoshop for artistic expression. I also use MODO, MAYA, Houdini, Realflow, and syntheyes for match moving. I have also dabbled in plugin development using c++ This is mainly because the C4D sdk is best utilized in visual studio instead of python ( the script language doe most of the 3d world) and I didnt take the time to learn c.o.f.f.e.e (c4d script language). 
 I have recently become a photography blogger and plan to lurk here. However if I can be of any help in an artistic level. I would be happy to volunteer my services. I see with over 300 people responding, there is plenty of coders better suited than I. I will follow along and hope I can find a way to contribute. Thanks for allowing me to be apart of this great community. I look forward to great things. Sincerely, Thomas Shue

Hi everyone,

My name is Nico, and unlike most people contributing so far, I don't have a
long illustrious career in development or coding. I'm a college student in
the north of Holland, and my skill set is basically limited to design and
SEO. I mostly do consultancy around school. I love wordpress and I set up
every client with it because it works so well every time.

I just figured I could add a bit in the design area of the UI of wordpress.

Anyways, my incomplete portfolio is here: www.nicolicious.com. Recent work
isn't included sadly, because I have some projects under development.

But, nice to see everyone, hope I can help somehow along the way.

All the best,
Nico

Hi folks,

My name is Mike Little and, along with Matt Mullenweg, I co-founded
WordPress way back in 2003.

I have 25 years software development experience, and have been doing web
stuff since 1994. I currently run my own web development company
specialising in WordPress (no surprises).

I am passionate about web standards, accessibility, and UX.

I would like to offer to do some accessibility evaluation and help with
practical advice where I can.


Mike

Hi friends and fellow WP fans,

I'm Dulce Rose Lada of Padd Solutions <http://www.paddsolutions.com/>. I 
run a small web design and development firm in the Philippines with 
WordPress as our CMS of choice.

Aside from overseeing the projects, I'm mostly in charge with the 
front-end graphic and design aspect of it. Some of our projects:

AuthorizedArticles <http://www.authorizedarticles.com/> - WordPress 
Design and Development
WPClassic <http://wpclassic.com/> - WordPress Design and Development
iBlogforPeace <http://www.iblogforpeace.org/> - WP Theme Customization

Also, I consider myself as a local WP evangelist here in our country 
where I do some speaking engagements about this powerful CMS. I've met 
Matt Mullenweg and Beau Lebens in the previous WordCamp Philippines.

I appreciate it that this list was created. Looking forward to an 
exciting collaboration!


All the best,
Dulce

My name is Matt Dulin, and you can probably classify me as a lurker, but
I'll toss in ideas if I get some worth sharing.

I'm a print-production specialist but have been working with a developer for
the past several months to build out WPMU as a CMS for a university student
newspaper that I help advise. It's such a promising platform for
publications of our size but I've started to notice some areas of the
interface that could be fine-tuned. My main experience comes from newspaper
editing and design, so I'm good at "beta testing" content, instructions and
systems with the end-user in mind.

I have no agenda for joining this group other than to observe the creative
process and to help wherever I can.

Hi Everyone,

My name is Jeremy Harrington. I'm currently leading user experience design
activities at Voce Communications. We develop WordPress applications for a
variety of large media, tech and consumer brands. We're develop WP, MU,
plugins and contribute both to WP core and most recently to the iPhone app.
I have over 12 years of experience in interface design and usability efforts
for large-scale enterprise and consumer web products and applications. My
background is in visual design, sociology and (for what it's worth) I'm bone
fide/certified by HFI in usability.

I'd be very interested in assisting with most any of the efforts Jane has
mentioned and am very open to finding ways to contribute to the product as a
non-core developer. I do have experience in user/task analysis and a
user-centered methodologies if those talents are needed but would prefer to
avoid performing formal usability-testing, unless we have a way to ease the
pain of management and logistics of such testing, which can be a extremely
time consuming.

Anyway, I'm very excited to see this group come together and hopefully we
can contribute and provide value to this community in much the same way as
all of the folks contributing to core do.

-Jeremy

Hi all,

My name is Dean Robinson, I'm a web developer/designer from Australia.  
I've been using WordPress for 4 or so years, and have a bad habit of  
starting new personal projects just so I can try out different ways of  
working with WP.

I'm the developer behind the Fluency Admin plugin which, for those of  
you not aware of it, gives a make-over to the current admin area with  
some new menus, styles and a few extra options ( more info here: http://deanjrobinson.com/projects/fluency-admin/ 
  ). I've also released a handful of other plugins and a few themes  
over the past few years ( http://deanjrobinson.com/projects/ )

I've got numerous other plugins and themes in a half developed state  
waiting for me to find time to finish them. I also released a small  
project last year which provides a basic API for developers to access  
download stats for their plugins and themes which are hosted on  
WordPress.org. WPapi started off as something I was building just for  
myself, but I figured it wouldn't be too hard to polish it up and let  
the rest of the WP community make use of it too. http://wpapi.org/

Away from WordPress, my most notable project would be http://hahlo.com  
which was one of the first twitter webapps built specifically for the  
iPhone, it was quite popular prior to the arrival of the appstore and  
the dozens of native alternative, however I'm still maintaining it and  
have held onto a small group of frequent users. More about hahlo can  
be found here: http://blog.hahlo.com (running WP of course)

I do all of this outside of work hours, primarily to keep myself sane.  
More about me and some of my work can be found over at my blog http://deanjrobinson.com/

I'm looking forward to participating in any design challenges such as  
the icon and admin UI ones that were run last year, and contributing  
back in some way to my favourite blogging platform.

Hi everyone,

My name is Andrea Mignolo, though most people call me pnts (pants).   
I'm an interaction, interface, and visual designer at Eastmedia (http://eastmedia.com 
), a New York-based Rails shop specializing in web and mobile apps.   
I'm involved in projects from the initial stages to completion in an  
IxD, UX, UI design role - discovery, research, sketching, wireframing,  
prototyping, mockups, and front-end design and development.

I've been using WordPress since version 1.2 - I used WordPress to  
implement the first community blog features at Free Speech TV years  
ago (the site was eventually moved to Drupal).  Since then I've  
continued to use WP for both personal projects and in my freelance  
work.  A somewhat outdated portfolio can be found at http://andreamignolo.com 
, and my personal blog using WP is at http://protocol7.net.

I'm excited to see where open source design can go, and am looking  
forward to contributing anywhere I can.  I'd love to see the "janky"  
page ordering implementation finally addressed, and I'd like to dive  
into the media uploader/manager/related bits more.  And also more  
nuanced admin interface for navigating sites with a large number of  
pages (especially those that have multiple hierarchies of pages)...

Good to meet you all, looking forward to what 2010 brings :)

Cheers,

pnts

Hello! My name is Lucian E. Marin. I'm a graphic and web designer from
Romania. I created one popular WordPress theme, which name is "The
Journalist". I'm here to help on a special topic of WordPress UI, the
consistency part. I think a lot of work needs to be done around this
subject. Most of you still sees WordPress as a CMS, but I see it as a web
application, an application that needs to excels with its user interface and
its user experience.

Have a nice day!

Did I miss the bus?

I'm shawncampbell of colorful Colorado. I'm a bit geeked-out being around
some of you, so forgive me if I'm sheepish or awkward. (Jane, can I have
your autograph? Gordon, can you get me a job at CF?)

Seems like we are all adept in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. No original
admin UI work, just modifications. I'd be glad to make comps
(non-desctructive, in Photoshop, with semantic structure/naming so we could
all share) or run tests.

Overall, I'm excited to help make the WP UI more intuitive for unexperienced
end-users.

One UI thing: I bet we could modify the UI to utilize thumb/mid/large media
sizes within custom fields.

Hi,

I'm andrea_r pretty much everywhere I need to pick a login. I figure I 
will mostly lurk, and input in the UI areas that will come over from MU 
& related to the merge. I have some experience in knowing how users are 
currently interacting with the Site Admin menus, and what complaints 
they have and where they get confused.

So if I'm following along, I will have a better sense of how the whole 
interacts, and how best to explain it to the masses. Translating 
geekspeak is my secret talent. Not really a designer, but I know what 
looks good. ;)

Oh, and I'm really good at testing things to see if I can break them.

I'm a WP fan/missionary and web development guru. Been designing for over a
dozen years and developing/web designing for a decade. I've been involved
with just about every phase of the web development process and translating
to the non geeks every step along the way.

Currently, I work in a webdev sweatshop running production. Still digging in
the ditches I also develop the jr's and troubleshoot all bugs and have
gotten to be fairly instant in identifying and fixing problems
(HTML,JS,CSS,PHP,Creative Suite, etc).

I'll lurk at first and chime in when I think I can add valuable input.

Talk soon,
Brent Stees

Hi,

My name is Kevin Cristiano and I have been involved with wordpress since
early 2006.  My location is the NYC metro area.  My main focus has been
themes and moving clients to Wordpress from static sites.  My main
background has been in databases from MSSQL (day job) and MySQL (WP).

As far as special talents that can be made use of for UI/UX I have gotten
the feedback of the clients I work with on the difficulties they have with
the current UI.

The one thing I would like to address is a better way to manage pages (not
just the Menu Maintenance, but a way to organize pages in the back end.

Hello all,

My name is Daniel Koskinen. I'm a WordPress consultant from Tampere,
Finland (UTC +2). I've been tinkering with WP since version 1.0 and
doing professional work for clients with it for the last 2 years. I
have an education in Interactive technology and experience in both
formal and informal usability testing. I believe this is an area where
I can help - I'd be specially interested in helping out in the testing
of current and new designs for the Post Thumbnail feature. Also
anything related to the upcoming custom post types (if there is going
to be an UI for that) would interest me. I haven't got my own
usability lab with one-way windows, but I do have Silverback and a
couple of laptops. :)

regards,
Daniel

Hello all,

My name is Michael Greenberg. Officially a computer engineer and like to
play with embedded systems, I've ended up dabbling in many different
buckets. Most of my experience is in web dev and more recently (last several
years) design. Never formally schooled, I've been writing HTML since 1997
and started with members.aol.com. *gag* My current home is at
http://nobulb.com where I try to maintain a professional presence and
doubles as my sandbox. I've been a software engineer for xG Technology
(small engineering firm in Florida) and have been developing a web based
network management tool (which we just released a tech demo of...here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnleO8H4lyY). I've done all the UI work on
that product and is SLIGHTLY representative of my work. (IMO, there's a lot
more under the hood than that video really shows.) I'd like to think I have
a keen eye for aesthetics despite the lack of formal training and an almost
OCD-type level for attention to detail.

I'm hoping to learn a lot from everyone else. The one aspect i'm truly
interested in improving on WP is how it handles media within posts. It's SO
freaking painful to add pictures from outside sources without hotlinking and
while what's there is good...I have some other ideas. More often than not, I
end up biting off more than I can chew professionally, but I'm looking
forward to seeing what can be accomplished with a product that I think is
fantastic and want to give a little back in return.

Cheers!
Mike

Hi all,

My name is Ash Goodman and I have been working with wordpress off and on
since 2006. LAst year I tooka  decision with my web design business to focus
exclusively on wordpress. Most of my clients are not bloggers and are not
looking for any specific solution by name. What they want is a website that
is easy to manage. I have been working hard with wordpress to develop
something more user friendly and intuitive to use. I feel wordpress is an
amazing platform (or I wouldn't have focussed on it) but sadly the community
can be very elitist at times. I am hoping to get more involved in order to
contribute and learn. I am just scratching the surface of PHP but am old hat
at markup and CSS.

I am a bit late for introductions, but hi everyone nonetheless.

I'm Mat?as Ventura. I'm a designer, student of philosophy and filmmaker who
has been designing for the web since 2001. My design abilities lay on fine
HTML + CSS and Photoshop skills. I have designed several websites with
WordPress and bbPress. I am also quite proficient at typography and jQuery.

As of recently, I have designed a mockup for the upcoming redesign of
bbPress.org features section --following the agenda of #bbpress irc
meetings-- which is currently in Matt's hands and which you may check here:
http://bit.ly/8Vfecq
 <http://bit.ly/8Vfecq>
You may visit http://matiasventura.com where you can find my work and
portfolio. I'm looking forward to contributing and learning from all the
fine people who have showed up here.

Take care,
Mat?as

Hello everybody,

My name is John Stevens, I live in Northern California and I have degrees in
Psychology and Economics from UCLA (go bruins!).  About two years ago I
attempted to make my first website and got totally hooked on programming and
design.  I ditched my career in insurance (a soul sucking industry) and
spent the next year or so teaching myself the fundamentals of web
development & design.  Though I taught myself, I owe a lot to the open
source community because it would not have been possible without studying
open source code and getting free tutoring on message boards.  I'm ready to
do whatever I can to give something back and in my opinion UI is really the
most important aspect of our industry because users are ultimately the ones
that support our careers.

I'm a huge fan of WordPress and jQuery and look forward to helping to make
Wordpress as user friendly, useful and flexible as possible.

Here is my most recent WordPress project with another due out in a couple
weeks:

Hello!

I'm Emmanuel Mwangi.  I'm front-end developer and product manager for
DoBidder.com and other sites.  Many of my projects use Wordpress.  I'm
mainly here to lurk and see how the UI is being developed since I'm a bit
too busy with other projects to take on another.  I am however, available if
you need someone to test out a build or a fresh pair of eyes on a problem.

Looking forward to seeing how this turns out as I'm really interested in
Open Source in user interfaces and visual design projects.  Wordpress is a
project with massive exposure and I'm looking seeing how it gets worked out
and developed.  I'm really interested in the tools that we have as visual
designers for software and how they scale for larger, more complex projects.

Hello everyone,

My name is Evan. I have been tinkering with websites for the past 10 years
and started to focus on them full time about 3 years ago. Before that I got
a bachelors in economics and philosophy, then studied graphic design. I have
loved watching WP evolve from its infancy as just a blog platform and now
want to be part of what it grows up to be. I am in a similar boat as most
people here, being fluent in HTML and CSS, with a good working knowledge of
php and javascript. My expertise lies in writing code that is as clean and
simple as possible to create rock solid, elegant solutions.

Two pieces I would love to see improved are how WP handles media and custom
fields.

hello ui-listers,
I'm david windham (http://windham.wordpress.com).
I'm on a small farm in lovely rural South Carolina, USA.
I like to wire-frame /storyboard with Fireworks
I spent years as front end dev for Django(ellington) and Drupal sites  
for Newspapers / Publishers.
I now point my clients to the usability advantages of Wordpress.
I've been on WP since pre 1.0 and am familiar with almost every  
function, class, id and db schema.
I'm currently working on a projects for Harvard, UCal, our neighbors,  
and my dad. :)
I'm also trying to be actively involved in the development of BBPress  
and Buddypress and you'll find me in the forums.
I like highly organized (properly tabbed) & well written code,  
semantics, and real time data syndication (pubsubhubub)
I have a degree in studio art and a serious interest in axiology and  
aesthetics.
Happy to be here, hope I can contribute and provide some good feedback  
along the way!
best regards,
David

Hello All,

I've lurked long enough, so here's the good oil on me. 

My name is Alex Colquitt, now based near Canberra, Australia, and I've 
been in the IT industry since the late 70's.

Yes, I probably pre-date many of you. 

My beginnings were in PC Technical Support & Management...  the dark 
beginnings as we're talking S-100 PC stuff here.  My company became part 
of the original Gang of Nine, who banded together to give IBM a run for 
their money on the release of their first IBM PC. 

Now, that all said, the old guy's fort? is software Alpha and Beta 
testing.  If you want someone to try and break it, just flick it to me..

Cheers,  and if there are any ZDS Plant 6 folks lurking out there..

Better late than never I guess. My name's Brian Milne, and I'm a blogoholic. Like most of you, I'm an avid WP supporter with more WP blogs than any human should have. Unlike most of you, I'm no pro when it comes to development and even design work once you get beyond the basic frontend stuff. 

But I've done plenty of UX work over the years and know a good UI when I see one having worked with dozens of brutal (and I mean brutal) CMS/publishing systems in the newspaper business. 

As for my background, I have a journalism degree from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, Calif., and spent nearly a decade as a web editor/senior writer for McClatchy Newspapers. I've since bailed on the newspaper biz to be a copywriter, content manager for a few local tech companies and have provided copy/content management for McClatchy, Web Associates/LEVEL Studios, HP, Experts Exchange and About.com. 

McClatchy's local paper and About.com use MU to power their blogs, so that's where my WP background comes into play. That and a handful of personal blogs and small business websites I've built around WP. I've also authored a couple of guidebooks on other topics and am working on a WordPress guidebook as we speak.

So my focus is copywriting and content management if you need any help there. Other than that, I can do some testing and will offer feedback if needed. I use Axure for wireframes, but am willing to test any prototypes thrown my way. I'm still on the Central Coast of Calif., so I'm usually on hand for WordCamps from LA to the Bay. I'm the pale, redheaded beanpole if you ever want to say hey. 

As far as improvements/suggestions: Other than making a wombat the WP mascot, an idea I like is adding the preview functionality -- similar to what we have on posts and pages -- to the theme editor. Don't know how realistic that is, or if it's already in the works, but there's a couple pennies for ya. 

Let me know if I can be of service.

Greetings,

I'm Dani, and my partner and I own Hot Glue Media <http://hotgluemedia.com>,
a web/graphic/tech/audio company based in Pottstown, PA. I've been making
websites in one form or another since the mid-90s, when I was
doing embarrassingly awful things on Angelifire and Geocities. My
professional background is mostly tech - primarily desktop support and DBA -
but these days I focus mainly on the design end of things and let my partner
handle the development.

I've been using Wordpress since v2.1. I've very much enjoyed watching it
grow into what it is today, and look forward to where it's headed. I'm a
lurker by nature, but if I see an area where I think I can be useful, I'm
happy to step up to the plate. I also have quite a few clients whose sites
are running WP, and I'd be happy to solicit UX feedback from them.

Aloha,

My name is How Bowers. I'm a jack-of-all-trades/master-of-none that's done
everything from magazine and advertisting design to CD-ROM interactive
presentations in Director, HTML way back in mid-90s, Flash programming, icon
design, some UI work, and now WordPress.

I use WordPress every single day so my focus would be primarily on adding
efficiencies to the UI to make the platform easier, faster, and more
enjoyable to use.

I've been a WordPress user from back in the 1.x days and I'm really pleased
by how much the latest 2.x versions have improved from a useability
standpoint. There are still some features tucked away in odd places and not
much control over where plug-in developers choose to put their control
panels, but by and large this is the most usable version of not only
WordPress but any of the blogging/CMS systems available!

Me not Jane, but -

I know what my main pet peeve about using WordPress, from a UI/UX point 
of view is -

WHERE IS IT?

When I install a new extension (or months after installing an extension) 
Where do I find it? Is it under TOOLS, SETTINGS, IT'S OWN TAB, etc?

And sometimes the extensions has settings one place and usage another.

Also, a lot of times the button to ACTIVATE, GO, ENTER, WHATEVER is in 
the middle of the text, near the bottom of the page, or (in at least one 
instance) scrolled off the right side of the screen.

Could things like these be standardized?

Fair point, and I completely agree, my "favourite" example is the  
Akismet stats page living under the 'Dashboard' menu item, why? why  
isn't under the comments menu?

However, I don't think this is necessarily something that can be  
solved, at least not entirely, by the UI since the menu which a  
plugins options etc appears in is determined by the plugin (and plugin  
author's choice). Happy to be proven otherwise though. :)

Dean is correct, It's each individual plugins choice, not something that is
controlled by the core of wordpress.  Some improved documentation in the
codex on organization and information architecture written with developers
as the target audience might be the best route imho.

The other solution that jumps out to me is the ability to change menu
structure on a user by user basis.  That seems like a nightmare for
documentation and instruction purposes.  I can already imagine a client
accidental moving something and then yelling "There is no add new listed
under Posts"

The standard argument that I usually use for these things is that mailing
lists are 'push' and forums are 'pull'.

I *will* read my email several times a day. But with the best will in the
world, I *will not* visit a forum several times a day to to see what the
latest conversations are (I might intend to, but I know it never happens).

And whilst I know that's sort of what RSS feeds are for, I still only check
my feed reader every couple of days on average.

I actually would rather have a forum than a mail list.  We could then break
the conversations up into categories and participate in those areas that are
most relevant.  Furthermore, we can subscribe via email to the forum topics
that are relevant to us.

Automattic is using P2 to manage some of their projects and the 
wordpress-dev efforts run through P2 as well and it seems to work. 
Scheduling meetings, discussions, etc. IRC is another great mechanism 
that is currently being underutilized for the UI list. I think we 
leverage a P2 site and IRC for the UI list and it will foster greate 
discussion.

if email- and RSS-subscriptions were built in, I?d agree to use a forum, otherwise I?d rather stay with a list.

There are plans to create a P2 for UI discussions and there already is an
IRC channel: #wordpress-ui.

Are there any forums out there that support reply-by-email and can send
posts as email? It seems to me that there should be a way set it up as a
forum but still allow people to interact as if it's a mailing list.

P2, and forums and IRC are fine if you are sat at a desk all day. I
regularly have to travel. I can get my email on my phone whilst on a train,
I can reply too. I cannot participate in a real time discussion on my phone
on a train.

And don't forget we are all in many different time zones. Other than
pre-arranged meetings, IRC is not great for ongoing conversations (even with
logs).

I read my RSS feeds in my mail program - Thunderbird.  So I don't have 
the problem of not checking my feed reader that often.

However, I also vote for (knowing this is NOT a democracy) changing to a 
forum after introductory stuff is worked out.

Are these list messages being archived somewhere?

Please either DON'T use bbpress forums or change it so that each and 
every message subject is NOT prefixed by the author name.  That totally 
kills any attempt to sort messages by subject since the subject line (in 
the newsreader/ Thunderbird, is now changed.

I have totally stopped reading and helping people at the wordpress 
forums for that very reason.  I set the reader to show the full web page 
rather than just the individual post so I can see the thread.  Even when 
I kill duplicates I will get a list of maybe 5 duplicates messages 
because the subject was
{authour1} subject 1
and is now
{authour2} subject 1
And because of the different anchors in the messages, the reader can't 
tell that they are the same.

Even with individual messages, trying to follow a conversation when you 
can't sort by subject nor thread is a total pain.

All posts asking about this have been ignored over there (WordPress Forums).

Talk about a UI/UX nightmare!

WIthout sounding, "trendy" Yammer might be another alternative. Mobile push
alerts with new messages, a per-message or digest email and public/private
posts/replies.

Subject: [wp-ui] Communication & first challenges
Message-ID: <9D93AE12-9B8B-4B74-89F7-785D2B182653@automattic.com>

Hi everyone.

#wordpress-ui chats. Since not too many people indicated time  
restrictions, I'm going to go ahead and set the official weekly chat  
time as 2pm Eastern time on Thursdays starting next week, which won't  
interfere with anyone participating in the WordPress Dev, BuddyPress  
or bbPress weekly IRC chats. I'm picking this time because if anything  
urgent comes up, I can roll it into the dev chat later that day for  
dev feedback. That's at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-ui.

P2. There will be a blog, but since far more coders than interaction  
designers responded to the introductions post here, I'm waiting to  
launch the site until people sign up for the first couple of  
wireframing projects so I'll know how many people are actually  
participating. I don't think forums in addition to a P2 would be  
useful right now, since threading will be important in following  
conversations.

Challenge #1: Right Now module on Dashboard. The Right Now module is  
pretty, but somewhat misleading. People get confused about which  
pieces of information relate to each other because of the lines and  
positioning. It evolved from the previous Right Now in 2.5, which was  
sentence style. The list format of the current Right Now is much  
better for translation, so we do not want to go back to sentence  
style. The first challenge is to reconfigure the information in the  
Right Now box (and/or re-evaluate what information belongs there) to  
be clearer, and wireframe a replacement design. Wireframes should be  
submitted by next Wednesday night so they can be discussed in  
Thursday's chat. Where/how to submit wireframes will be posted on  
Monday, as i need to work out some upload permissions first. Ideally  
people will work together and submit joint wireframes rather than  
everyone submitting their own.

Challenge #2: Better menu management. Right now the core development  
crew is working on a way to manage site menus from the admin. They  
started from existing plugins and widget code, and as a result, it  
could use some UI help. I don't want people to start from scratch and  
submit their dream model, because there's already work in progress.  
Just drop by the Trac ticket and provide UI feedback/suggestions. http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11817 
  No timeline here, this one will be ongoing until freeze.

Upcoming Challenges: We're starting out with small things on purpose,  
as has been discussed before. As this process becomes more solid,  
we'll move on to bigger UI things like the Plugins screen, the  
Comments screen, and the Settings area. People who prove to be  
collaborative and helpful will have opportunities to lead these mini- 
projects, so please be nice to everyone and try to work together  
rather than competing.

Thanks,
jane



A footnote:
We're trying to create ways for interaction designers, information  
architects and graphic designers to contribute to core, in more  
meaningful ways than an occasional design contest. It will take some  
time to iron out the best ways for it to work, as there are other  
things of high priority being worked on at the same time (3.0 merge,  
anyone?). Anyone who likes things to be already worked out perfectly  
should really unsubscribe and check in again in a couple of months  
after all the infrastructure is up, a few design challenges are out of  
the way, and we're settling into a productive routine. If you wouldn't  
go work for a startup, then you might want to hold off on the UI list.  
Also, there's been a lot of traffic on the list suddenly about why  
this isn't a forum, etc., but as I look at the posters, I'm seeing a  
lot of coders rather than people who make wireframes and comps, which  
is, if everyone would remember, the point of this list. If we wind up  
with the kind of griping that keeps popping up on wp-hackers, it won't  
be useful, so please keep posts to UX and design issues. Thanks. There  
will be a web site going up soon, but it's part of a slightly larger  
effort, so in the meantime this list is where communication about  
design challenges will happen officially, or in the #wordpress-ui  
channel, though IRC is better for real-time collaboration that ongoing  
brainstorming.

If people need to know what time that is in their local time, you can use
this page
http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_US-NY.aspx?y=2010&mo=2&d=4&h=14&mn=0


Jane, will IRC logs be recorded and made available?

Hi Mike. Yes, I'm getting it set up before the first official chat  
next week, so it will be at http://irclogs.wordpress.org/ along with  
the other dev chats.

I hate to bring it up, but Google Groups might do the forum/list hybrid
thing. I'm trying to think of something else that's similar, because I know
that Google can't be the only maker of mailing list software that allows
users to interact with it like a forum, but I'm coming up short.

A quick search of (for example) the bbPress plugin directory shows a lot of
email-related plugins, but the notification plugins seem to only work on
favorite threads. Perhaps one of those can be used as a base for a plugin
that presents users with settings similar to the mailman settings for this
list but for forum threads. Then reply-by-email would be (unless I've
forgotten something) the only thing left.

Yes, trying to use bbPress would probably draw on the developers in this
group. But if anyone else has a better idea, please shout out. I'm not fond
of the Google Groups idea either myself, but I too would like to have a
forum-style discussion platform.

The official UI group of the WordPress project will use this mailing  
list, the #wordpress-ui IRC channel, and a P2-format discussion blog  
for the forseeable future. The blog will be launched next week.

I'd like to join the UI weekly chat but I'm challenged to understand how (at
least this should ease Jane's concern that folks on this list are too much
like coders).

Suggestions on an IRC how-to in plain English?

The Freenode FAQ has instructions like this:

Register your IRC nick:

*/msg nickserv register <your-password> <your-email>*
*
*

Which is not very meaningful to me.  Like I type this where?

Thanks!

you need an irc client (

contains a couple of links about irc that might be worth checking out.

Tim,

 

You need to download an IRC program like mIRC or something similar.

 

You'll connect to the #freenode server, and the room to join is
#wordpress-ui .  A lot of the chat programs will give a GUI on changing your
name and all that good stuff.

Hello,

I'm a little late on the intro, but here is a little bit.

I'm Jonathan Stegall. I live in Atlanta, so Eastern time. I have been
working in design/development on the web for about four years fulltime, and
maybe 9 years on the side. I currently work as a Marketing Technologist at
CareerBuilder.com, which means I work on lots of side projects for the
company - niche sites, blogs, marketing sites, etc., so I spend a lot of
time with WordPress. I also do some freelance, and use WordPress there as
well.

I'm predominantly a designer in skills/passions, though I know the guts of
WordPress, and PHP/MySQL itself, fairly well. I try to be a big advocate for
web standards - including the new ones like HTML5 and CSS3, and also for
user experience and usability, as the two worlds kind of merged for me a
couple of years ago. So I can wireframe, make comps, etc. as well as write
code. I only have a little experience with usability testing, though I'd
love to learn more about it.

I don't have a whole lot of hours to dedicate to WordPress, but I do love
the project and would love to help out where I can, and where things are
needed.

Good morning, everyone! This introduction is perhaps a little late, but
better that than never. 

Anyhow, my name is John and I am the owner of designsinflux here in Tucson,
AZ. I have been designing websites since the mid- to late-90s; however, I
have never attempted to jump into the professional ring until recently -so
recently in fact, that my company's website is still currently under
development. I have been playing around with WordPress off and on now for 1
year. The website that I'm working on for my company is WP-based and I fully
intend on "pushing" WP to my future customers as the primary foundation for
their websites. My focus is primarily on UI / UX, but I've been known to
sink my teeth into the back-end aspect of things as well (e.g., PHP,
jQuery).

So, yeah ... that's my story and I'm sticking to it. If you want to get in
touch, please do.  

Thank you.

Sincerely,
John W. Vermaes

I would definitely like to see a better way of handling menus. Right now I
am using metadata key/value pairs to let the user determine which menu a
page should be included in. (for example the main menu or a footer menu).
The nice thing about this is that it lets them add a page to a menu by
ticking a checkbox, and its available from the page editor screen.

This is in my opinion one of the faults of the other menu management
options. You have to go to a separate screen to add the page into your menu.
What would be nice is a menu management tool like the screenshots you show
with a management screen of its own, but also with the ability to have a
popup (like the media library) on the page editor screen that will let you
add the page to the menu without leaving the page editor window.

Another area that needs some work: the new page/post thumbnail option. Its
just not intuitive at all. I know its early days yet for this feature and
I'm sure its being worked on. But there should be a way to add multiple
page/post thumbnail boxes to the page/post editor screen. There should be a
way to add descriptive labels these boxes (for example box 1 is for featured
post thumbnails, box 2 is for xyz, box 3 is ...). If there is and I've
missed it, please share!

Another area that needs some work, the custom taxonomies. If you add them
for posts you get a new entry under posts that gives you a screen to manage
them, if you add them for pages you get nothing. Again maybe there is a way
to do this already? But in posts its automatic, in pages not so.

Just a few thoughts.

Thanks for reading!

Subject: [wp-ui] wpmu2.9.1.1 and wp2.9 comparison (+ wpmu3.0 migration)
Message-ID: <8810a71a1001310209v11788ee8q4495183a10db5837@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

When you look at wp mu 2.9.1.1 and wp 2.9, there is some work to do on admin
ui (to have specific wp mu admin pages looking like wp admin pages) :

Points that can be discussed :

* 'Site Admin' menu :
** a fancier menu admin icon for 'Site Admin'
** 'Admin' sub menu option : suppress ?
** 'Blogs' sub menu option : page 'look & feel' like Posts > Categories page
?
** 'Users' sub menu option : page 'look & feel' like Posts > Categories page
?
** 'Themes' sub menu option : should this sub menu option migrate to a 'MU
Themes' option in "Settings' ?
** 'Options' sub menu option : should this sub menu option migrate to a 'MU
Options' option in "Settings' menu ?
** 'Upgrade' sub menu option : should be replaced by the usual wp upgrade
notice

* WPMU Users :
in wpmu some fancy menu bugs should be fixed.
* When Site Admin > Options > Add New Users is set to 'No', Users > Add New
appears like this : 'Add New *' (that redirects to Site Admin > Options >
Add New Users anchor). This option should be disabled or hidden.
* When Logged as Administrator, editing a Site Admin > Users > currently
logged user, current menu option (bold and black) goes from Site Admin >
Users to Users > Your profile (looks ok for me)
* When Logged as Administrator,  editing a Site Admin > Users > other user,
current menu option (bold and black) goes from Site Admin > Users to Users >
Authors and Users (current menu option should stay to Site Admin > Users).

* Settings pages :
** 'Reading', 'Discussion', 'Media', 'Privacy' pages look similar
** No 'Miscellaneous' in wpmu
** 'General' and 'Writing' are different

I believe all those topics (and others like thinking of a review of Settings
(*)) are in the scope of this working group.

Last point : Did anybody succeeded in wp2.9.1.1. to wp nightly build (3.0)
migration  ?
I personnally have this message :

Fatal error: Call to undefined function wp_redirect() in
C:\Vn\wpmu\wp-includes\ms-settings.php on line 91

Thank you

(*) Settings menu with one submenu :'WordPress' giving a setting page with
'General', 'Writing' .... as tabs.
