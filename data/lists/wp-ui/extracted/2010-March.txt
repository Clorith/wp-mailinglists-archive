Message-ID: <849302.18615.qm@web59407.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello everyone,

I am Ashish Mittal from India planning to participate this year under?Wordpress for coming gsoc 2010.

I?was wondering if?the following project could be useful for Wordpress or may give it some enhancements.

- Creating an AR (augmented reality) project for Wordpress website. This project would give an additional enhancement to Wordpress website and could describe it in a?short, crisp and a very impressive manner. A proper theme chosen for the project could make?it the perfect development and could make it very impressive for online visitors(interested volunteers, contributors, donors).

Please guide me in regards to the above project or something similar Wordpress may need.

Best Regards,
?-Ashish Mittal

Hi Ashish. As it is the Google Summer of Code and not the Google  
Summer of Design, you should post this to the wp-hackers list, not the  
wp-ui list. That said, our primary goals with GSoC projects are core  
functions and core plugins for features that users ask for over and  
over again. A niche project like this does not really fall into that  
category.

Hi guys,

I know today is the deadline for the design tasks set in last week's  
UI meeting - Just to let you know I added replies with links and  
mockups to the thread on make.wordpress.org/ui some time ago but they  
haven't been approved yet.

Message-ID: <e1202cb11003271357m5e2df4fn38150276a61240ed@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys, this was discussed on the wp-ui dev blog (
http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2010/03/11/summary-of-march-11-meeting-going-with/comment-page-1/#comment-67
) but I don't think it was mentioned on the list so I thought I'd
update everyone and give people a chance to see where its at so far.

The trunk SVN version of WP now has a new light header/footer graphic
to replace the old black color. I blogged about it here:
http://simianuprising.com/2010/03/27/wordpress-admin-header-redesign-light-or-dark/

And the trac ticket is here:
http://simianuprising.com/2010/03/27/wordpress-admin-header-redesign-light-or-dark/

The question is whether to go with a light or dark theme. The light
one matches the header to the dashboard widget gradient while the dark
one matches it to the active sidebar heading (dark grey) gradient.

Hi Jeremy,

The shade of grey of the actual bar was discussed at length several  
weeks ago - A mockup was discussed which was  almost identical to the  
gradient which you've produced in your blog post, however the lighter  
version came out on top. I've suggest that the darker variation could  
replace the "classic" blue color scheme - so we'll see how it goes on  
that one.

Cheers

John

I agree when it comes to the old (genuinely classic) blue UI - however  
this hasn't existed for some time, the current blue configuration has  
been somewhat of an afterthought for a while now and there are quite a  
few mismatched styles.

It either needs lots of love or a changeup - there's also no reason  
that blue (or any other coloured) admin skins couldn't be plugins.

:)

Fear not. We're not getting rid of the blue version. There will not be  
two gray versions.

Perhaps in the future there could be a more robust theme  
customization. If it was somthing we wanted to look into, we could  
start a discussion? Maybe somthing on the lines of http://www.madebytinder.com 
  or even as simple as a css theme switcher with a color picker and  
automatic comlimentary color selection using Adobe's Kuler themes?

a suggestion.
