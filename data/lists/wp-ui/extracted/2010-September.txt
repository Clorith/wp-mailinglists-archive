You should be able to log in with your normal WordPress.org credentials as far as I know

spoke too soon.

Was able to login, but am still unable to reply. It now asks me to 
login again! Tried it, and still the same.

Subject: [wp-ui] Accessibility query
Message-ID: <4C875AA4.8000809@elfden.co.uk>

(cc'ed to 2 lists, please be careful when replying)

As some of you may know I've suggested some accessibility enhancements 
for the Twenty Ten theme.
encompassing trac ticket: #14782

But that side(ie mainly CSS changes) is virtually complete, aside from 
correcting/adapting things to fit in a little more smoothly.

Next on the list would be for me to look at forms.

However I think I need to check on how far this will go before effort 
is put in, as the changes would be vast.

A lot of the forms are split into boxes, so I'll concentrate on that 
for the moment. Each box is, generally, a collection of inputs within 
an all encompassing form. Ideally these should be in fieldset's, with 
accompanying legend's.

Additionally, text inside a form, not in labels or fieldsets, isn't 
readable by 'all' screen readers when in _forms mode_.
http://www.pws-ltd.com/sections/articles/2008/accessible_forms.html
JAWS 10 may be addressing this issue, but it will be a long time 
before that is widely used, and it should not be the only screen 
reader considered to be in use.

However correlating the necessary changes would involve a great deal 
of work and time. Actually making the changes would involve more work, 
and more time.

So I suppose the crux is, is accessibility a high priority? If it 
isn't I doubt that the core team can spare the man hours and any work 
that I might do is likely to become obsolete very quickly if not 
implemented sooner rather than later.

I'm more than happy to put in the time and effort but would feel more 
comfortable knowing that we are on the same page when it comes to 
accessibility. If not then I can put that effort elsewhere within 
WordPress.

  To participate in the UI group, you'll need to create a wordpress.org 
login so you can comment on the blog. The mailing list is not meant to 
be a substitute, and may even be discontinued in favor of the blog. If 
you already participate in wordpres.org forums, it's the same login 
information.

Subject: [wp-ui] Thesis: The impact of design ethnography and Wordpress |
 Client - web designer relationships in the nonprofit sector
Message-ID: <BAY146-w2726F020BB61C601C7F2A0B5780@phx.gbl>








Hello!

I have recently finished a master's degree in social anthropology, thesis titled: The impact of design ethnography and Wordpress | Client - web designer relationships in the nonprofit sector. I simply wanted to let anyone who may be interested know the text is now online, and to please provide any feedback or comments you feel necessary!

Website: http://www.appliedanthrodesign.com/thesis/

Abstract:

The  increasing rate of technological innovation and integration into 
the daily  lives of many online users has spurred both the 
reconceptualization of the  digital divide, and the promotion of 
user-centered research methods; that emphasize  the significance of 
variability in technology acquisition. No longer is  technology to be 
considered an external tool, where success depends on basic  
functionality, but an integrated player affected by the social relations
 and  environment in which it resides. Through Niklas Luhmann?s systems 
theory in  combination with actor-network theory, this study aims to 
look first at the  systems in which nonprofits and web designers 
separately operate; how their  processes are altered with the 
introduction of design ethnography and  Wordpress; and finally which 
human and nonhuman actors may be utilized in the  creation of websites 
for nonprofits who desire technological self-sufficiency.

Best,
Kristina Krause

We'll look into it. Last we checked it was an odd authentication issue
related to P2 and our unique setup on wordpress.org.

I opened it up 2 weeks ago to work with standard WP commenting: name/ 
email/url - so not sure why it wouldn't be working!

I'm about a fair bit during the day(but this time of night is pushing 
it...) if you need me to test any changes.
