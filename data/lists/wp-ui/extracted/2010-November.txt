Where do you define the categories that I'd like to subscribe to?



Which topic categories would you like to subscribe to?

By selecting one or more topics, you can filter the traffic on the
mailing list, so as to receive only a subset of the messages. If a
message matches one of your selected topics, then you will get the
message, otherwise you will not.

If a message does not match any topic, the delivery rule depends on
the setting of the option below. If you do not select any topics of
interest, you will get all the messages sent to the mailing list.

Hi Haluk. We actually don't use this mailing list anymore, as it's been 
much easier to use the group blog at http://make.wordpress.org/ui.

Dear Jane,

I am Danial Keshani, UI designer and I would like to join the group and help
as much as I can.
How can I do that?

Thanks,
Danial

Hi Danial,

You'll want to follow http://make.wordpress.org/ui/. They meet on Tuesdays
in IRC (see the sidebar on the blog). You can also reach out to John O'Nolan
who I believe you met at WordCamp NL this weekend.

Cheers,
Nacin
