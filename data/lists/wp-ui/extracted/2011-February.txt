Hi there,

I am a newbie in the world of Wordpress. I would like to create my
company's website using it. I look for a simpe template, enabling the
following:

- the outlook would have four parts
- the upper-left would show the company logo
- the lower-left and the upper-right would have menus
- the lower-right would have the content, first static only,
   with some pictures

Which one would you recommend?

Cheers

- Gergely

Hi Gergely,

This isn't really the best place to be looking for that sort of advice.

I would recommend looking through the Themes
Directory<http://wordpress.org/extend/themes>on WordPress.org, and
maybe use the
filters <http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/tag-filter/> to find your
perfect theme.

Kind regards,

HI Gergely,

Most of these functions you listed here are not template specific. From the
look of what you are looking for here, most can be performed within the
WordPress software and be displayed on the template. Sounds like what you
need most is training. Once you understand all of WordPress' functionality,
you will then be able to pick a template that works best for you.

Regards,

Hello,
I understand what you are looking for. I would anyway like to point out 
that choosing a theme from the Wordpress database means over 1,000 
people all ready use it.
I recommend you either hire a professional designer or a MODer.
If you do not wish to hire anyone to design your Wordpress website then 
I would recommend you type the following Tags in the Wordpress Theme 
Database:

- Flexible Width
- Editor Style
- lower-right
- edit-able logo and picture
- 4-parts
- lower-content
