Subject: [wp-ui] Sketches and diagrams in open source software development
Message-ID: <52EACC6D.5040702@uni-trier.de>

Hello everybody,

I'm a Ph.D. student at the Software Engineering Group of Trier
University (Germany). Our group is currently investigating the use of
sketches and diagrams in software development.
I'm especially interested in how software developers create, use, and
share sketches and diagrams in large open source projects like WordPress.
I write to this mailing list to ask for hints on where to find sketches
and diagrams related to the development of WordPress (maybe your version
control system, bug tracking system, or wiki?).
I'm primarily looking for sketches and diagrams directly related to
source code (e.g. architecture diagrams, sketches visualizing a bug or a
certain data structure).
Thank you for any help you can provide!

Best regards,
Sebastian
