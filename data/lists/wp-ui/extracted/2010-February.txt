I missed the IRC chat the other day. Since then I've not seen anything

I don't think so... although specific project discussions for the group are
at http://make.wordpress.org/ui/

I think you should just post it here, so we don't waste time.

Like I said, these are the notes I've been taking, so there are 
probably some redundancies. (And it should explain the length as well.)

Problem with the existing page menu:
    Since the functionality is based on the wp_page_menu... there are 
significant limitations:
    - Is based on "Page Order"
    - Only allows one menu
    - Only includes pages
    - includes all pages & children unless specifically described in 
template tags
    - No core UI options for including/excluding pages from the menu
    - No core UI options for describing the # of levels to include

    To manage it now you add/change the "page order" number of each 
individual page.

----------------------------------

Questions that need to be Answered (And a Few Statements)


** Custom-Menu vs. wp_page_menu
    - Will wp_page_menu be depreciated?

    - If no custom-menus have been created, is the wp_page_menu (using 
page order) returned?

    - A separate "Don't include in Page Menu" option shouldn't be 
added at the page level, but than means that in any circumstance NOT 
using a custom-menu, all pages will be returned. [A little more about 
this under the hierarchy options below.]


** Multiple custom-menus
    - Is there a default unique custom-menu? In the existing code, I 
think it's just the first menu created.

    - Does there need to be a method for selecting a different default 
custom-menu (new or existing)?


** Custom-Menu Items

    + Type (Required): Home, Page, Category, * Taxonomy, Link
       (I'm not sure if "Link" should be the right term, since it 
looks like the current link just records a url unrelated to the Link 
list.)
    + Title (Not required):
       - Unique title for this item on a specific custom-menu
          OR
       - (default) Uses the original title of the item
       Note: the ui should display (but not edit) the "real" title of 
the item.

    + (Depending on Type)
       - Reference to an object (page, etc.)
       - URL
       - ? Non-link Text Title for a sub-menu


** Hierarchy (for Custom-Menu Items)
       This seems to be the thorniest part being worked out in various 
mockups, but I think that once we nail down how this works, then it 
will be a lot easier to work out how to communicate it to the users.

    + Should there be a limited number of levels? (for adding menu-items)

    + Dealing with Menu-Items with children (the referenced object has 
children.):
       Possible options are
             a.) include all children
             b.) include specific children (decided at the child page 
level, and would roll into the wp_page_menu function as well)
             c.) include specific children (unique to this specific 
custom-menu)
             d.) exclude specific children (unique to this specific 
custom-menu)
             e.) do not include the children (of this referenced object)

    If there are hierarchies in the custom-menu unrelated to a 
referenced object's (page's) children, then a custom menu-item could 
have "Do not include this PAGE's children" BUT still allow explicitly 
added sub-menu items below it.

    (After writing that... I realized that we may actually use terms 
like sub-menu for menu items to really make the differences clearer.)


** UI / Front End Notes

    + Should there be an automated option to create a custom menu 
populated with (what would be) the output of wp_page_menu, before 
being manipulated

    + Drag & Drop item ordering /addition?


** Questions about other interactions:

    + Assign Category to Static Pages 
(http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11550)
       - Current discussion suggests pages get listed after posts (in 
what order?)

    + New Template Tag:
       How will this affect the existing "page_order" functionality, 
which is currently based on a parent, and than assigning a number to 
each page. If the page order is decidedly separate from custom menus, 
then the "page order management" needs to be looked at separately. (It 
already has its own ticket, but just wanted to make that clearer.)

Message-ID: <81f6ff5b1002090948u1a46ede5qca8031a55d289374@mail.gmail.com>

I've posted 2 sets of mockups for the tabbed theme menu we discussed last
week here:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/gastonfig/sets/72157623247561125/.
 This menu will combine the "manage" and "add new" theme menus into one
tabbed interface.

The first set is inspired by the visual/html tabs from the post and page
menus.  The second set has bigger tabs and incorporates the header text into
the tabs.  I personally like the first set.

What do you guys think?


Thanks,
-Gaston

Hi Gaston

Much prefer the first option.

Hey Gaston,

I prefer the 1st set. I don't mind slightly larger tabs but the ones on the
2nd set are a little too large. I feel the icons add to the largeness and
might work better without them.

Bruce.

Hi all,

A little bit late I'm introducing myself. My name is Francisco, but most
people know me ask Wiki.
I work as a project leader in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I run my own
freelance proyects at wikichaves.com

My last WP proyects are
- upandconnected.com
- bloggertone.com (using wpmu)

I hope I can help with WP 3.0 redesing (I'm anxious about WPMU merge)

Regards !

Hi Gaston,
I agree with the group so far - the first option with the smaller tabs  
works best for me too.

What about something in-between?  I agree that the second one is too big,
but I think the first one is a bit small. In particular, I think people on
small screens or with visual problems would have a difficult time with the
first option.

All the best,

Wouldn't they have problems with all the similarly-sized buttons
throughout WordPress? I think they'd just use the zoom tool in their
browser.

I believe something along the lines of the first comp to be a better solution.

Let's try to zoom out from this problem a little bit and think of ways to extend and standardize the WordPress Admin's design language. In future, tabs may be a good solution in another area of the admin too. Instead of solving this *specific* problem, let's solve the problem of what tabs should look like throughout the interface.

Definitely the first version. Text tabs work better, I think, than the
larger graphical tabs. The second option seems very heavy and looks
like it would take a lot of space unnecessarily.

Hello Gaston,

The first choice seems like a better choice to me because it looks more
uniform like most of the other screens in WordPress.

Yes, but the overriding idea of this group is that we are CHANGING the 
current overall look.  That may not be the goal, but it will be an 
outcome.  Therefore, rejecting ideas because they will make things 
different is not a working model.  Although I still agree that #1 looks 
better to me.

Actually, making choices that are uniform to the current look of  
WordPress should be a guiding principle. We are not here to change the  
current overall look at all; we're here to tidy up specific things  
that could be a little better while staying within the current UI.

Sorry. I'm new here in this list so I might have missed the discussion about
what is the purpose and goal of the WP design group.

If the idea is to change the current look overall then I agree with Emil but
I believe we then need to look at WP from a wider view and make changes in a
top-down approach.

If the idea is to make small changes, then I stick to the 1st option.

I sit corrected. (Difficult to stand and use keyboard at same time.). 
However, a fear or loathing of change is a bad thing.

Uniformity is a good thing.  At least that was beaten into me in boot 
camp lo those many years ago.

Is there a wordpress style guide?

I've been playing with a way to unify or at least address all the 
versions of the Menu Management section that have been tossed around. 
(And in doing so looked into a few versions of the tab interface.)

Now my 2 cents: Since this is such a new group, a really good low 
priority project would be to look at the visual & interaction patterns 
that already exist. That way we can re-use what already exists in new 
designs, identify where there inconsistencies and have a common 
language to share when discussing larger changes.

(I guess something like the codex...)

Now off to finish what I started.

As has been stated in various blog posts, initial emails to this list,  
etc, this group is NOT being formed to change the current look of  
WordPress. At all. The goal was to have an infrastructure for user  
experience/interface designers to contribute to core tickets, just as  
there is an infrastructure for developers to participate. The  
development infrastructure gets clogged up when people start arguing  
over small UI details, so we split it off to have a more focused  
group. If someone wants to start a movement to try and convince the  
project leadership to undergo another overall admin redesign, this is  
not the place for it.

I repeat: this group was created to contribute to ongoing UI efforts  
in WordPress core, NOT to redesign the application. This has been  
stated categorically by WordPress leadership...the current design is  
one that people are happy with as a foundation for improvement over  
the next couple of years.

Matt Thomas had planned to write one when the styling of 2.7 was first  
done, but other projects got in the way. I'd actually planned to post  
a styleguide project as one of the items that people could help with;  
there'll be a post on the UI blog about it next week.

Good news: it looks like we'll be incorporating the Woo Custom  
Navigation system into core. I've spoken with Woo and they are working  
on turning their custom menu system into a core patch. Since everyone  
likes their system, this should save us a lot of menu debate. It  
allows for mixing pages, categories and external links, reordering, etc.

For all new comers, can you remind us what are the "ongoing UI efforts

How would this affect the front end flexibiliy? For example I use meta
values to assign pages to different navigation menus (main and footer for
instance). Will that kind of fucntionaity still be present. Or better still,
can Woo's system be made to support multiple navigation menus? Is it
something a theme can support/not support like page thumbnails.

I realise this may not be the right place to ask these questions, but I
haven't heard anything about this on the wp-hackers list (I only signed up
in the last couple of weeks) nor have I seen anything about it anywhere
else. And I don't have a woo theme.(I probably should buy one). Can anyone
point me to where this is being discussed? And a timeline for its
implementation?

There should be an initial patch by the end of next week attached to  
the trac ticket for menu management.

At this point, the core team has already made a decision to go in this  
direction, so there's not much discussion other than it being  
discussed in the IRC dev chat yesterday (and the UI chat) and people  
being psyched that Woo is willing to contribute the system to core.  
You won't hear much about it on wp-hackers, because that's more for  
new ideas and questions than decisions that have been made.  
wpdevel.wordpress.com is the active core developers' blog, trac, and  
the #wordpress-dev weekly IRC chat are the main places core decisions  
get made and written down. The real discussion will come when the  
initial patch is posted and everyone can start reviewing the code etc.

That's right. It was this post that brought the Woo menus to the  
attention of the core contributing developers.

Just a reminder: please trim your posts! Easy to forget in Gmail  
especially, but it's important to keep the list traffic to the new

That would be the idea, though I imagine it would to be more like
registering a widget sidebar, versus registering post thumbnail support. I
have not seen the Woo code but that is my understanding anyway, and is what
was indicated as desired when scope for 3.0 was set.

I realise this may not be the right place to ask these questions, but I

It was first mentioned publicly on the wp-ui list and on Trac yesterday. It
was then discussed in the weekly dev chat on #wordpress-dev.

Woo is currently preparing a patch for core. Jane said we should anticipate
seeing the patch posted to Trac early next week, at which point it would go
through the same thorough review as any other patch, and be subject to
modifications, improvements, and a series of commits.

If you want to follow along development (in general), wp-hackers won't help.
I'd keep an eye on:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org, specifically
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11817 for menu management
http://wpdevel.wordpress.com
and #wordpress-dev on IRC

Idea for adding to Dashboard's What Now block :

USERS (56)
ADMIN (3)
PENDING (6)

Or some such.

Would be nice to know how many users are pending and need to be looked at.
Having the number of admins visible is a security concern.

Dear Jane,

How would you feel about creating a separate (from this group) "WordPress-Design" group and process that is dedicated to a product-design of WordPress?

It could, and probably should, be disassociated from the short-term UI challenges that are in touch with current development efforts&  trac tickets. It could be granted a freedom to explore directions&  ideas without being bound to development and without having development bound to it. In time development and design may make connections, share ideas... it would be an indirect exploration rather then resolution of specific/isolated version-related challenges.

There have been numerous voices on this list showing interest in this direction - which have been met with some resistance. Maybe instead of pushing this energy aside we can all benefit from giving it an alternate space for expression?

All Things Good

tI think the first demo's tabs are too small to be used in such an
important way. Yes, they match the visual/html tabs, but that is a
perfect reason NOT to have the page tabs look this way. Switching
visual/html is a small change that manages just one part of a large
complex page (edit-post.php). These new tabs will be doing MUCH MORE
than that, altering the entire content of the page, losing any changes
done to the previous 'tab'. As such I think they need to look
significantly more important than the visual/html distinction, and I
think the second option makes way more sense for several reasons
stated below.

Importantly, I think people are completely wrong to say the
title-style tabs are too big or 'take up too much space'. If you open
both mockups and switch back and forth you'll see that the large tabs
actually take up LESS vertical space than the small ones, because the
tab labels serve both needs, tab AND page title, removing entirely the
need for a huge page title above the tabs.

In fact, if you look carefully at the two mockups you'll see that
Gaston seems to have accidentally favored the small tabs by making the
two ideas take up the same vertical space even though the 'big tabs'
have less height: in the big tabs mockup there is extra unnecessary
padding between the tabs and the list of links. If we clean up that
space we see that the big tabs take up less space while simultaneously
giving much more precedence to the tabs themselves, making the whole
system more useful and harder to miss at a glance.

Actually, after putting them side by side and cleaning up some other
spacing issues (the big tabs weren't vertically aligned with the
sidebar, pushing them down even further) in photoshop I was pleased to
see that the difference in vertical space consumption was 100%
opposite of what people thought in responses so far. I think this
resulting graphic shows very clearly how much space is actually saved
by going with the title-tabs:

http://simianuprising.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wp-tabbed-admin-pages-wrong.png

So #2 is the real space-saver, and if that is our main concern we
should not choose #1.

The other concern is consistency with the current design, which is
obviously important both for maintaining the smallest possible set of
design patterns to keep things simple and for avoiding users
accustomed to the old way from being alienated from the new way. In
that case I think that #2 still has a lot going for it.

While there may not be a precedent where UI tabs look exactly like
that I think we're missing the fact that it has the extremely valuable
feature that it matches how PAGE TITLES are currently shown. If these
are page titles and not sub-sections of a single page, having them
look like page titles is a good idea. The fact that the outline and
shading of the tabs should take as much from the visual/html editor as
possible is fairly obvious, and I think #2 does a good job of merging
together the styles of the visual/html tabs with the normal look of
page titles in WP Admin.

-------

All that said I think the bigger question is exactly what we're trying
to achieve here. Sorry if I missed an earlier conversation about what
the tabs are for, but I see two possibilities each with important
ramifications:

A - We are fundamentally removing pages from the admin and merging
them together. We would just make one long-ass page and tell people to
scroll but we would rather clean it up with tabs.
    * The goal is to have less choices in the sidebar to make things simpler.
    * It is a bit harder to get to specific tabs/pages (especially
secondary tabs) but maybe its worth it.
    * In this case the deleted page should be removed from the sidebar
as in the mockups.
    * We should use mockup #1, as it clearly denotes that the new page
is only one page with two sub-tabs that compose it.
    * Switching tabs should not reload the page, but instead use
javascript to jump back and forth in the content which is already
loaded.

B - We are grouping together related pages to make it easier to find
related pages.
    * The goal is not to have less pages but to make navigation
between pages easier.
    * All pages are still visible in the sidebar (unlike in the
big-tabs mockup), but it is easier to see what pages are related to
the current one in the header tabs.
    * Each page is still its own url and switching 'tabs' merely jumps
you to the new page, with a full html reload.
    * Mockup #2 (big tabs) should be used because it maintains the
individuality of each page while still denoting their relatedness and
making it easier to navigate between pages.
    * It also serves to denote subservience of one page to the other
in a useful way (i.e. if you are in the 2nd tab of a set then you know
that the first one is probably the more important one. i.e. Manage
themes is more important/common than install themes).

IMHO these two goals are very different and require different solutions.

I personally don't like the first (A) option. I think the
relationships it defines will tend to redundantly replace the
relationships present in the different sidebar sections. I also think
that removing sections with lots of options from the sidebar will make
things harder to find overall. If we do this it should be with extreme
caution, and the example in the mockups should not be executed because
these two pages are not part of the same options, but rather
fundamentally different.

I personally like the intention of the second option (B) even though
I'm not totally convinced its necessary. I often find myself on an
admin page wishing for direct links to related pages in the header. A
perfect example is the newly added 'add new' button in the headers of
Edit Posts and Edit Pages. I'd been dying for that since 2.7 came out.
In a similar way I think the big-title-tabs system proposed in mockup
#2 would help people get many tasks done more easily.

There are problems with the idea (B) though, the biggest being how
strange it would be to have some pages in a sidebar section grouped
into tab-groups but not others. Why not have 'edit themes' and 'theme
widgets' mixed into the header tabs for the appearance pages? Looking
at my settings sidebar section makes me even more nervous. What pages
would be linked together and which would be orphaned? With time I
could learn the idiosyncratic relationships the pages have to each
other, but for new users it would probably seem relatively random.
Another problem is that any more than a few big tabs would be too much
for many screens to show and they'd drop to a second line, which would
just look awful.

-----

Sorry for the ludicrously long post. Hopefully it has some food for
thought going forward.

I think the smaller tabs preserve more horizontal space: allow for a higher
number of tabs on a page.. Not all users are on large screens, many still
use 1024 resolutions. And then there are mobile devices.

Since I am now getting 5 autoresponse emails from this address every

I don't quite get it. Don't people actually test their autoresponder
scripts before gallavanting off on a day trip? Why does this sort of
thing need to happen?

I have experienced people not even knowing how to use BCC, or editing the
subject line of a conversation at every reply. Auto-responders are just
another one of those email features that not very many people seem to know
how to use correctly.

Overly long signatures are another thing I see quite often. I don't think

I'm in favor of Jeremy's Option A, with JavaScript switching between tabs.
Ignoring the visual appearance for the moment, I like the way systems like
MediaWiki's user preferences operate, loading everything then hiding all but
one tab using JavaScript. Doing that with the large tabs would be fine by
me; I'd like it, and I think it would be usable. The only constraint (and
this is relevant whether the tabs are switched with JavaScript or full
reloads) is number of tabs. Lots of tabs could break into multiple lines,
killing the experience.
