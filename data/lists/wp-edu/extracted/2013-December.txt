Subject: [wp-edu] WP plugin for membership
Message-ID: <121FA83C-181E-440A-81F8-4075C12038FF@em.wisc.edu>

I'm working with the WACRAO orgainzation (Registrars and Admissions Officers) on a new website,

We are looking for a membership plugin that does the following:
- input institutions (universities and colleges in the Wisconsin/midwest area)
- add contact details for that institution, especially email address, but also name/address/phone/etc
- have a signup form where a person
- - can enter their logon details, and then select one of the institutions from the list above
- - allow the login details to be entered manually, and let the user select a username and password
- - allow the user to log in via social media (FB/Twitter/Linkin/etc)
- - not allow the person to log in till their application has been approved by the contact at the institution
- - automatically generate an email to the institution contact that someone had requested an account on WACRAO for their institution
- - allow the institution contact to approve/dis-approve the persons application. Ideally, this would be by replying to the email, but logging into the site and approving there would also be ok. As long as the workflow was simple and easy to understand.
- - have a limit on the number of people an institution can accept.

I'm having problems finding a plugin that does most of that. 
Most membership plugins seem to be for generating income for the website, which is not what we are interested in.

Any suggestions on a plug-in that might provide that functionality?
Thanks
Jim

I'd start with Gravity Forms and explore their add-ons, and then use a
different plugin for managing logon access. The automated responses can be
pre-programmed in Gravity Forms.

Subject: [wp-edu] How Best to Import Users via command line script into sub
 sites on a Multisite Network
Message-ID: <7.0.0.16.2.20131218115838.0355d868@avantigroup.com>

Hi - Happy Holidays to all and here is hoping the WP-Edu Santa 
Spirits and Code Elves can help me with the following ...

my question = does anybody know how best to import users via command 
line or via php script into sub sites on a Multisite Network ..??.. 
and/or know how best to go about extending a plugin that does import 
users into sub sites like, Cimy User Manager - 
http://wordpress.org/plugins/cimy-user-manager/ - e.g., with an api 
or other code that runs the plugin at command line ..??..

as fyi, Cimy User Manager seems to do a great job of loading a list 
of users via csv file into a sub site but this requires the GUI and a 
number of admin clicks ... thus got to thinking if it was possible to 
run a plugin at command line so initially i posted this thread -> 
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/api-or-method-to-import-users-from-command-line 
...

accordingly, any help or pointers that can be shared to add users via 
command line scripts is greatly appreciated ... to be continued ... 
cordially, chuck scott
