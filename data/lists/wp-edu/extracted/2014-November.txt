Hi David,

>From what I've been reading Rackspace does not support wildcat subdomains, which means you'll need to use sub-directories for mu, but if you're leaning towards them, ask about that. Other cloud hosting services I've heard about include Amazon's EC2 (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and vps.net, but this is only from what I've read and not from experience.

Subject: [wp-edu] Wordpress hosting with LTI integration

Hello WP-Edu-ers,

We are looking at integrating WordPress more tightly with our LMS via LTI (http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm).

Although we have our own internally hosted multisite instance that allows any of our users to serve themselves with new WP sites we are looking at cloud hosting that would provide the LTI integration.

Anyone have any experience with commercial WordPress hosters and/or LTI? If so any info you have would be appreciated.

Thanks,

David

Hi David,

We run LTI on http://blogs.ubc.ca and integrated to Blackboard .

It's just a plugin. I think any host that allows you to install plugins and run Multisite you are good to go with.

WPEngine might be worth checking out?

Scott, do you need to have separate users? How do you handle smashing the Blackboard and WordPress-only users in a single WordPress install? I was thinking of spinning up a separate WordPress multisite install just for LTI integration with our D2L environment?

Hey D'Arcy,
 
Each course gets a WordPress site users are added when they click the LTI launch link. 

It has been transformative for UBC Blogs. We have one department using it like a content store for some courses and just using LTI for access control. 

I think we are on the same page in thinking the LMS in this situation can really foster the adoption of using tools like WordPress if the overhead of managing users is handled well (it really is a headache for large courses).

One thing our traffic has switched to active sessions from majority static which was challenging scaling wise (still working on improvements).

Good evening,

As a newcomer to LTI and WordPress, which objectives are being advanced and perhaps fulfilled by such integration? Is the goal to push WP to provide analytics feedback in reports like the performance dashboard in LMS's? Trying to better understand how students and faculty benefit from this independent of where their data is hosted.
