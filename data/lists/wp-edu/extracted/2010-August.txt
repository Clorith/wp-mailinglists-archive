Ken,

Awesome list, and it was very useful for the upgrade to 3.0 that UMW Blogs
just underwent.  Here is my post sharing the play-by-play,

http://bavatuesdays.com/umw-blogs-upgraded-to-wp-3-0-a-play-by-play/

And hope you don;t mind that I republished your email there because I found
it a key ingredient to how smooth everything went.

Gracias,
Jim

Message-ID: <BA0BBE87-B1E0-4487-B059-EA4B45229280@berkeley.edu>

For those of you managing lots of WP installations spread across  
disparate domains on a single server (at an .edu or elsewhere), wanted  
to let you know I've made some big improvements to wp-mass-upgrade and  
wp-create recently, and bundled them as a kit: WP Mass Tools:

http://birdhouse.org/software/2010/08/wordpress-mass-management/

We choose to use this system rather than running MU because upgrades  
remain easy, working with random paths and domains remains easy, we  
don't have a single point of failure, etc.

Best,
Scot

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=CAOQwy3M+sa_s+hpc5SK4OLTBoKM46u2b-FbF@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!,

I am new to this listserv and look forward to learning from y'all.  I run
the UNC-CH Wordpress MU instance at http://web.unc.edu.

Our site is new and only has around 350 sites so far, but we are growing
fast and I am finding I need a good way to see what sites are being updated,
and what ones are not so I can contact, and disable old sites as they go
stale.  We, probably like many of you, have many sites that are just created
and abandoned.

I would also like to be able to easily see which sites are using certain
themes / plugins / etc. and email them.

Anyone developed, or know of something like this?  If not, would you be
interested in working on something like this with me?

Best,

~Jeff

Hi Jeff,

For the plugin and theme info, we use this pair of plugins:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpmu-plugin-stats/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpmu-theme-usage-info/

We haven't had much need (yet) to look at update dates in a more
complicated way than sorting the blogs list by updated date, but I can
foresee wanting the information as we grow.

Good luck with your site -- we'd love to hear more about how it's going for you!

best,
Amy

FYI -- Lafayette College recently launched its redesigned web site --  
it was created by Viget Labs (who did Duke's web site not to long ago)  
and is powered by WordPress.

Here's post by Viget about it, with a before and after picture of the  
site home page. :)

Congratulations to you and Lafayette College, this looks brilliant. And I
have to say, I'd love to hear more about the architecture etc. It think it
is very close to a model UMW will tak this year when we follow your lead.

Congratulations indeed, what a great use of WP! We at the Eastman School of

aren?t rolling a total redesign in with it. Would also love to hear more

Thanks Jay! And thanks all your work documenting Bates' WordPress  
project. Bates was one of our go-to sites when demonstrating how  
WordPress could be used as a CMS.

Yeah, I liked those too, particularly the "behind the scenes" one. It  
spawned a nice side conversation about WordPress as CMS.

Lafayette and Bates are two amazing examples of what can be done with WordPress to power a university site. I am heading up efforts at Lincoln Memorial University to convert our existing site to WordPress. One issue we are running into is how to properly assign permissions to the various people on the team, which includes multiple departments on campus. Would those who have implemented WordPress in this way share how they arranged their organizational chart to handle admin, safety, security, updates, web standards, duplication of efforts, etc.? Any other pieces of advice would also be appreciated. Thanks!

Joshua

Joshua,

Your best bet would be to install the Members plugin and create custom roles and permissions.  This way you can assign certain pages to certain departments and they will not be able to edit any others.  Or, you could create custom post types for each department and assign a custom role to that post type.  You have lots of options.  If you are looking to filter WordPress down to subsites, I would probably investigate the multi site setup as it would help with your permissions and making site-wide updates.

It was good reading both project posts from Viget.

Yeah, I liked those too, particularly the "behind the scenes" one. It
spawned a nice side conversation about WordPress as CMS.

Thanks, Ken. 

I'm no longer at Bates (back, now, in the consulting world), but I published links to those posts and graphics on my personal site. 

	<http://jaycollier.net/portfolio/strategy/bates-online-media/>

Our designer, Ethan Magoon, is now stewarding the home site, and I'll suggest he join this list.

I've been planning to develop an online space to support WordPress in learning communities once my current project is complete. Then yesterday I received this announcement from Acquia which sounds a lot like what we're already doing!

	<http://acquia.com/resources/drupal-solutions/education>
	<http://scholar.harvard.edu/>
	<http://bit.ly/dje5SH>

Do you know of similar initiatives with WordPress? Anyone? Is there interest?

There is no shortage of great examples; there were three updates to the WordPress in Higher Ed spreadsheet already today.

Hi Joshua,

In our current testing using multisite, we are using a combination of Role
Scoper, Capability Manager, and Revisionary for fine-grained control of
permissions. This allows us to assign or restrict editing rights of pretty
much anything (including custom post types) per-user or per-group.
Revisionary allows us to assign users to only be able to submit a revision
to a page and have e-mails sent to the appropriate approving party. So far
we don't have very many users, as we're still in R&D mode, but it seems to
be working very well thus far. The admin screens and options are admittedly
confusing at times, but the truth is that there will probably only be one or
two of us ever worrying about user permissions, just the same as we
currently do with web server accounts.

Joshua-

In my experience managing and editing department sites, I've found that custom permissions weren't worth the extra effort. In WP 3 multisite, each department will have its own site, so only those users you've assigned to that site have access. 

Also, I have always asked for a single editor authorized to publish content (at the default "editor" level) and when there are others (such as faculty) who have permission to update individual pages, I've assigned them as "authors" for final approval by the editor. As people show their enthusiasm and skills, you can shift them up ... or down ;)

(BTW, Tiny-MCE-Advanced allows you to shut down most of the eggregious editing buttons -- like text and background color, left and right justify, etc. -- so authors and editors don't get into trouble in the first place.)

Then, using WP-Audit-Trail, student assistants, armed with quality assurance guidelines, periodically checked out what had been published on each site and provided recommendations for improvements directly to the site editors. Of the 50 sites I managed at a previous college, I only had 1-2 editors who were resistant and who were escalated to me for triage. Over time, the deans assigned others to take over that role. As a matter of fact, recognition of the importance of public communications was integrated more deeply into job descriptions for future hires.

As to initiating sites: at first, we assigned sites based on the org chart -- so there would be clear authority in a dean or director -- and then eventually opened up to microsites that targeted particular audiences or activities, and for which there were experienced editors. The only "administrators" on each subsite were members of the central team, who made changes to widgets, child themes, etc.

Your college culture may or may not support that type of workflow, but I would recommend prototyping with some early adopters and see if the built-in permissions are enough. If not, you can always add more control later.

Hope that is helpful ...

Agreed. I'll add that when it comes to content editing I emphasize to users that WP keeps track of page/post versions to that the site admins can see who has edited what and that you can restore older versions of content. Same emphasis when it comes to users or our wiki system. I've yet to see anyone egregiously damage content. And I've rarely seen any inadvertent editing of pages that a user shouldn't be editing. In those cases older version restorer has resolved the issue.

>  Lafayette and Bates are two amazing examples of what can be done with
> WordPress to power a university site. I am heading up efforts at Lincoln
> Memorial University to convert our existing site to WordPress. One issue we
> are running into is how to properly assign permissions to the various people
> on the team, which includes multiple departments on campus. Would those who

> organizational chart to handle admin, safety, security, updates, web
> standards, duplication of efforts, etc.? Any other pieces of advice would
