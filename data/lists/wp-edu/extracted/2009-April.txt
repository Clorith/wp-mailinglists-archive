Hi all,

I know this email list isn't all that active, but I wanted to take a moment to announce the recent launch of our new UA News Center which has been redesigned to run on Wordpress.  In addition to the site that handles our news, we are also using Wordpress to drive two other sites with more feature-oriented content.  The main goal with this redesign was to improve the functionality as well as spread our best content between these sites.  Please feel free to explore the sites and share any thoughts you may have.


*         UA News Center (main site):  http://uanews.ua.edu

*         Research Magazine:  http://research.ua.edu/

*         Dialog Faculty & Staff news:  http://dialog.ua.edu/

This project has been in development for a while now, so it's gratifying to see it go live.  I do have to say that WordPress is very flexible and I have come away from this experience impressed with it as a platform.  At this point, I'm surprised when it can't do something.  There are some interesting bits of code and functions that I've implemented and if you are interested, you can either check our web design blog (http://webtide.wordpress.com/) for updates or email me.

Thanks,

I am jealous. Congrats!  WordPress really is a neat little system and I 
think it's well worth the work.  What would you say was the step of this 
project that took the longest?  What would you do differently?

I am checking out your blog too. Handy stuff, thanks!

"What would you say was the step of this project that took the longest?"

Having never developed a Wordpress site before, I found that I spent the most time figuring out the functions as well as all the little intricacies that aren't documented well.  After becoming initiated, I moved into all of the custom features we wanted and/or needed.  That is probably what took the longest.

"What would you do differently?"

I would probably find some book or video that walked me through all aspects of developing for Wordpress.  I probably made the mistake of diving right into it without some kind of preparation.  But, I now know more about Wordpress than I ever would have expected when starting this project, so I chalk it up to a great learning experience.
