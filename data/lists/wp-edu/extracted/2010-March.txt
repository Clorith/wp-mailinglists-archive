WordPress was recently announced as a participating organization with  
Google Summer of Code this year. This program is a great opportunity  
for students, and can help advance WordPress at the same time. For all  
you college campus types, it would be great if you could spread the  
word in the computer science departments. Having students write a  
plugin or a patch is a great short assignment for PHP development  
classes, and getting into the Summer of Code would make a great  
independent study.

Thanks,

Hello everyone,

My name is Aram Zucker-Scharff and I work for the Office of Student Media at
George Mason University in Fairfax, VA. My office is running a WordPress MU
system for our campus. However, we've had some recent server issues and have
come to the conclusion that our current hosting is insufficient. I've been
doing research on various hosting and setups and I was hoping that anyone on
the list who might be running a WPMU setup might be able to give some advice
on hosting options. What are the specs, are you hosting with a third-party,
and if so who?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
-Aram Zucker-Scharff

We have our WPMU install on a dedicated server hosted by softlayer.com<http://softlayer.com> .

The specs are pretty standard--
2.66 ghz quadcore xeon processor
4gb ram
2 seagate 150gb hard drives in raid

That's a little misleading, though, because that same server also hosts our main college website, several stand-alone WP installs, several drupal installs, and miscellaneous testbeds and smaller projects (omeka, moodle, dspace, OJS).

It's been running very well, and we've been extremely satisfied with the service from softlayer.  Their monitoring and security have been excellent, the automated backups have saved us several times, and the included support has been extremely fast and cooperative.  The only time we had to have a paid incident for extra support the charge was $5.

I've also had very good experiences for my personal site (shared server) and another open educational site I'm involved in (dedicated server) with totalchoicehosting.com<http://totalchoicehosting.com> .

I haven't tried the yet, but my kids' school is switching to
stackable.comsoon, and it's looking very attractive: it scales, load
balances, and has a
great dev environment, without you having to worry about managing a server.
I haven't had time to move everything over yet, so if anyone ends up trying
them before I do, let me know how it goes.
