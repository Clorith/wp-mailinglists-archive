Jane,

Thank you for all your efforts organizing this. I'm speaking at WCNYC, so
obviously biased, but your interest in academia is really apparent in the
lineup.

I've been going to the San Francisco camp since it started because of the
outstanding speakers and learning opportunities. Thank you for bringing that
to the East Coast and making it bigger without raising the price ($40 is
cheap money for the awesome sessions on the schedule for the weekend[1]).

[1]: It really is an awesome lineup:

I just realized that this may have come across wrong. I meant 30  
people had registered for the Ed/Academic track. Over 300 have  
registered for WordCamp NYC so far overall. :)
