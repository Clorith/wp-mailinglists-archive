Subject: [wp-edu] Wordpress hosting with LTI integration
Message-ID: <85F05EE0D1E7E1499CCFFE9E3DFDF43C15D7E191@SSVMEXDAG01MB03.tufts.ad.tufts.edu>

Hello WP-Edu-ers,

We are looking at integrating WordPress more tightly with our LMS via LTI (http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm).

Although we have our own internally hosted multisite instance that allows any of our users to serve themselves with new WP sites we are looking at cloud hosting that would provide the LTI integration.

Anyone have any experience with commercial WordPress hosters and/or LTI? If so any info you have would be appreciated.

Thanks,

David
