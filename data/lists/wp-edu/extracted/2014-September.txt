Subject: [wp-edu] looking for price comparisons to build university news site

Hi all,

We just got a quote to build our news site in WordPress.  This quote 
does not include design, only the build.  We asked for some special 
logic around promoting stories to various levels of "featured," however, 
the quote is rather high.

I'd be interested in getting some cost example from other folks who have 
hired a vendor to build their WP site.

Thanks, Sara

The costs can run a wide range per hour/day depending on who you ask.

There are several tiers of WP developers. In a nutshell, they are
something like this:

$35-$50/hour - Someone who can get the site up and running from scratch
using an existing theme and make some basic modifications to the theme and
customizations.
$75-$100 - Can do all of the above, and can custom design and code your
site with responsive customizations from a barebones framework.
$150-$250+ - A known leader in the industry who has deep framework
knowledge and enterprise-class skills, plus e-commerce chops.

What you need is one of the first level persons to do your customizations.
Sounds to me like it is a day's work or less (or even an hour, if it's
simple).

Your description of needs is a bit broad, so it's hard to say for sure.

Thx - Steve

Hello all,

Has anyone used implemented an LTI connecter for WordPress (e.g. http://www.spvsoftwareproducts.com/php/wordpress-lti/) ?

If so I'd love to hear about your experience with it. What LMS you are using? What use cases it's enabled? Etc.

Thanks,

David
