Subject: [wp-edu] Two questions, even referring to doc is helpful
Message-ID: <09DED73804A95B42ACFEFF57AEA3B24E07A852EA@MAIL3.AD.Brown.Edu>

I am using WPMU 2.8.6 on my own server.

 

First, is there a plugin for this?  

 

Anyone know if there's a plugin for this? Or an easy setting? When users
currently log in to my system, they get the "Your Profile" page.
Instead, I want them to get to the /wp-admin/index.php?page=myblogs
view.

 

Second, how do I create blogs without using the dashboard?

 

Shouldn't this work? I have my own php script where I am trying to
create a blog using the wpmu_create_blog function. I use:

$domain = "******.brown.edu";
$path = "blogs/abc123";
$user_id = 107;
$title = "A new blog";
$meta = Array("public"=>1);

wpmu_create_blog($domain, $path, $title, $user_id, $meta = '', $site_id
= 1);

But when I run it, I get:

Fatal error: Call to undefined function add_action() in
/opt/local/apache2/htdocs/blogs/wp-includes/wpmu-functions.php on line
1781

So I look at that line in the code and I see:

<p class="message">%s</p>

It is true that add_action() is not defined in this file, but it is
defined in plugin.php. I see the doc for add_action, but am I supposed
to link up wpmu_create_blog with add_action? Is that how this is
supposed to work?

I'm looking through the Codex for how to create blogs. Anyone got it
bookmarked or something?

This plugin *might* help:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/peters-login-redirect/

Not sure if it can do what you want or if it even works with mu.

http://vogsphere.org/redirecting-wordpress-subscribers/

That is possibly a better solution if you have the knowledge to create your
own plugin and put in the business rules regarding the redirect (if the user
is just a subscriber and doesn't have any blogs then the myblogs view
probably isn't suitable and the default profile page might be ok?).

What files are you including above the call to wpmu_create_blog?

If you only included the file that that function is within then the
add_action function within another file won't be included. Instead you
should probably include the wp-load.php file in the root wordpress folder.

Having some trouble with the Anarchos Media Player (AMP) plugin.  It
seems like a pretty straightforward plugin, unzip into my mu-plugins
directory and then activate.  Ok, problem there.  I'm looking in my Site
Admin, and there's no reference to anything that looks like AMP.
However, I do get the yellow A button on my editor when I create a new
post.  But when I click on the A button, I get nothing.  I ran firebug,
and the error that I get is "edInsertVideoSite is not defined"

 

Anyone heard of this?  I'm not finding much with google and the AMP's
own forums seem to be taken over by pharmaspam.  That's not very
re-assuring.

 

Or if you use a different but similar plugin from AMP, what is it?

 

Thanks.

 

Patrick

Hi Patrick,

I know that Jim Groom recently found that the Anarchy Media Player was
causing him problems (http://twitter.com/jimgroom/statuses/8394198236).  I
use Viper's Video Quicktags --
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/changelog/

You might also consider upgrading to WordPress 2.9, which allows video
embeds via URL - http://wordpress.org/development/2009/12/wordpress-2-9/

Best,

Matt

I have found podpress to be far superior to AMP if you want to actually embed videos that you have uploaded (not just links to video on other sites like video quicktags or 2.9 embeds will do).  Podpress gives you an integrated player, customized still image, and (if it's a route you ever decide to use), an iTunes-friendly feed with enclosures.

I'm not sure why Podpress is not more widely used--maybe because of the perception that it's only for podcasting--but I have had very good results with it over a long period of time.

Patrick,

We use Anarchy Media Player still at UMW Blogs, but are in the process of
phasing it out because it is not supported anymore, and can be a bit of a
resource hound.  That said, I personally haven't found a media player that
works nearly as well.

If you still want to use I can send you the files I have and are working.

Best,
Jim

Hey Jim,

Can you say more about your process for transitioning away from AMP?
Given AMP's state of (non)support and WP native embeds, we'd like to
nudge our people away from it before our service gets too much bigger,
but we wouldn't want to just shut it off if it's going to break the
content that's already in place. Are you giving your users warnings?
self-help instructions? some kind of upgrade scripts for existing
embeds?

Thanks,
Amy

Amy,

Right now we are recommending users against it, and pushing for straight
embeds in HTML view.  we then are going to go through the database and
rewite all the AMP code for YouTUbe videos (99% of the usage) to a straight
embed code which should solve the problem with bad code and lost videos.  As
of Fall 2010, Anarchy will no longer be available, and we'll check out what
the best options for audio uploads are.  We've stayed away from PodPress
because it too is a resource hound, and adds an unimaginable amount of
tables to each blog database.  More than that, no one uploads their own
videos onto UMW Blogs.

Viper's plugin integrated into 2.9.1 is promising, but I haven;t tested that
with audio yet.  Anarchy worked brilliantly with audio, but turns out most
folks used it for YouTube, nonetheless, it was a beautiful thing for audio
when it was still supported.  I'll miss you anarchy.

Jim

Thanks for the feedback everyone.  I think what sounds like the best
before for us, just starting out with nothing currently, is to use the
2.9 Embed.  Might as well go native, rather than depending on a 3rd
party plugin.

 

Thanks and very happy to get all the feedback!

Amy,

Right now we are recommending users against it, and pushing for straight
embeds in HTML view.  we then are going to go through the database and
rewite all the AMP code for YouTUbe videos (99% of the usage) to a
straight embed code which should solve the problem with bad code and
lost videos.  As of Fall 2010, Anarchy will no longer be available, and
we'll check out what the best options for audio uploads are.  We've
stayed away from PodPress because it too is a resource hound, and adds
an unimaginable amount of tables to each blog database.  More than that,
no one uploads their own videos onto UMW Blogs.

Viper's plugin integrated into 2.9.1 is promising, but I haven;t tested
that with audio yet.  Anarchy worked brilliantly with audio, but turns
out most folks used it for YouTube, nonetheless, it was a beautiful
thing for audio when it was still supported.  I'll miss you anarchy.

Hey Jim,

Can you say more about your process for transitioning away from AMP?
Given AMP's state of (non)support and WP native embeds, we'd like to
nudge our people away from it before our service gets too much bigger,
but we wouldn't want to just shut it off if it's going to break the
content that's already in place. Are you giving your users warnings?
self-help instructions? some kind of upgrade scripts for existing
embeds?

Thanks,
Amy

Is anyone else using the Shibboleth plugin for Wordpress, preferably MU?
We're looking to use it for groups management especially with course
blogs, but it's not quite ready for that, plus it will not work with the
new WP 3.0.  

 

Anyone else worrying about this or thinking about solutions?

 

Thanks.

We're using an LDAP plugin, slightly modified. It talks to our Active
Directory. The only issue we've come up against so far is that for blogs
that need non-University members, we have to create a separate instance with
separate rules. Since we're still pre-implementation at this point, I can't
say how well it will work out or even how often it will be used.

Thanks Skip, there are a number of problems with the LDAP plugin for us.  For one, the connection between the WP and LDAP server is not SSL'd (thought I might have seen an update recently that it is).  But the bigger need for us is to have federated access, which clearly LDAP doesn't offer.

I think SSL is one of the mods our developer did. Or got what was there to
work properly in our environment. At any rate, our login is definitely SSL.
But yeah, the federated thing is an issue, and not just with WordPress.

Shibboleth keeps lurking around the back room, but we haven't got it
integrated into anything yet.

Anyone heard of a Wordpress plugin that will mail a new post
"somewhere"?  Maybe to a list of subscribed email addresses.  I'm not
just looking for one that *notifies* when there is a new post, I
actually want the text of the post emailed somewhere.

 

I'm finding plugins to post by email and notify, but nothing yet that
actually emails the whole post somewhere.

 

Thanks!

If you sign up your RSS feed to feedburner, you can embed a "subscribe by email" widget.  The entire post will be mailed to subscribers.  Super easy to set up.

I'm using the Twitter Tools plugin with a widget and one thing I'm
noticing is that when my tags and @ is linked (don't know why some are
linked and some are not), but when they're linked, there's a line break
after the # or @ and the tag or username.  

 

Does this happen to anyone else?  I don't see it in the plugin's "Known
Issues".

 

Are you using a different twitter plugin with better success?

 

Thanks!
