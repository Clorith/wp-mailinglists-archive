Thanks Steve, and Happy New Year everyone.
I tried the relevanssi plugin a while back ? but it still wasn?t returning pdf results. I also need the content of the pdfs to be indexed, which that plugin won?t do.

I figured out how keep the default wordpress search box (without the ?powered by Google?) pulling in Google Custom Search results into a custom page that I have styled with css and Google fonts to match my design. So far so good. (php is not my thing, so it took some time to figure out)

Two other questions,
What resources do you look to in terms of Wordpress in Higher Ed?
Any recommendations for Wordpress hosting?

Thanks, and have a great day.

Are you using the Download Monitor<https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-monitor/> plugin? It uses a custom post type for each entry, so you will get better results if your downloads are included among all post types.

Thx ? Steve

Subject: Re: [wp-edu] Wordpress hosting with LTI integration

Good morning all,
What search solution/plugin are you using on your Wordpress site? The default WP search is lacking. Being in higher ed, we use a lot of PDFs, which the default search doesn't return. I have tried implementing Google Custom Search, but I need it to work with the default search box - not as a widget. (I can't have the search box say "Google custom search" within the search box)

Any help/advice would be appreciated.

Hi David,

We run LTI on http://blogs.ubc.ca and integrated to Blackboard .

It's just a plugin. I think any host that allows you to install plugins and run Multisite you are good to go with.

WPEngine might be worth checking out?

Hello WP-Edu-ers,

We are looking at integrating WordPress more tightly with our LMS via LTI (http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm).

Although we have our own internally hosted multisite instance that allows any of our users to serve themselves with new WP sites we are looking at cloud hosting that would provide the LTI integration.

Anyone have any experience with commercial WordPress hosters and/or LTI? If so any info you have would be appreciated.

Thanks,

David

>
>Hello WP-Edu-ers,
>
>We are looking at integrating WordPress more tightly with our LMS via LTI
>(http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm).
>
>Although we have our own internally hosted multisite instance that allows
>any of our users to serve themselves with new WP sites we are looking at
>cloud hosting that would provide the LTI integration.
>
>Anyone have any experience with commercial WordPress hosters and/or LTI?
>If so any info you have would be appreciated.
>
>Thanks,
>
