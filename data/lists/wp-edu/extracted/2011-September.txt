Subject: [wp-edu] Email Users plugin causes mysql to hang
Message-ID: <BD52A663-96B9-4C2B-BBF2-0283C04C3A5E@mhc.cuny.edu>

I'm not sure if this is specific in some way to our install, but I thought I'd share because it caused me so much pain before we fixed the problem.

We've been using the plugin "Email Users" on many of our class sites in our fairly large network for a couple of years.  It's always worked very well, even though it's officially not tested on a multisite install.

Then sometime a couple of weeks ago, probably about the time we passed the 2000-user mark as the new semester began, we started having mysql failures several times a day.  Intermittently, at odd times, mysql CPU usage would jump way up--as far as 205%, so it would stop responding until restarted from the command line.  

I tried a lot of different troubleshooting steps, looked at the mysql slow queries log, and found that most of those times the cause was a query to the wp-usermeta table. But other times queries to that same table were going through quickly with no problem. But I could not figure out (my skills are not strong enough) anything beyond that. 

Finally on Wednesday we had someone notice that every time she tried to email all students in her class using the Email Users plugin, that triggered the problem (we only noticed because she tried the email, mysql hung, I restarted mysql, she tried again, and it hung again.)

I deleted that plugin, nobody is using it anymore, and the problem is completely solved.  No more issues and the site is fast and responsive and stable again.

So if you're using this plugin, beware.  It seems to have problems with large installs.

Hey Joseph,
Thanks for the post.

This would be great information to post in the WordPress.org forums too:

Cheers,

Good idea.  I did post on the plugin developer's own forum, but others might not see it there!

We are looking for a service to install and update wordpress, plugins and themes.

I second that request. We're interested in recommendations for agencies that have experience administering and managing multisite and BuddyPress installations.

Have you checked out http://codepoet.com/ ? I'd be interested to hear whether it's useful for recommendations (my team works on it). WP Candy also has a database: http://wpcandy.com/pros

The VIP service is too expensive for our needs, and requires plugins be vetted before being used. Is there another Automattic service to consider?

In any case, we're right in the middle space -- statewide online community for educators -- and are hoping to find folks who have specific education and BP experience.

Thanks for the tips coming our way!

Daniel-

At CodePoet, I searched for "education BuddyPress" and received this: "Sorry, we couldn't find any Code Poets matching your search." WP Candy doesn't break down into vertical markets at all.

From my experience, the enterprise environment and theme/plugin recipes are somewhat distinctive for the education/collaboration space. However, I'd be happy to be convinced otherwise!

Great points. I'd agree that most CoetPoets are geared towards enterprise but I bet we could convince them otherwise if there were projects. Let's continue talking

Thanks, Daniel.

I'm delivering progress reports every few weeks in order to build a solid architecture for the work, so feel free to share with any CodePoets who might have interest.

I've also been keeping Boone up to date and, for others who are moving in this direction, have had great conversations with Cyri Jones who is starting up a similar service for British Columbia.

If you know of other regions, states, or provinces with such initiatives, please let me know!

Hi,

I'm new to the list and having a little bit of trouble finding information.

I would love to talk to someone to see what all I need in order to use WordPress as a LMS. I'd like to learn what plugins to use and what I need to pay for vs. free options. I am a technical writer and not a programmer so the easier things are the better! My company doesn't have the budget for a paid LMS, and the programmers are too busy to help me with Moodle.

I will probably be using Captivate to generate the content. We need:

*         Unique Login for students

*         Paid lessons

*         Free lessons

*         Tests with automatic grading (%, pass/fail) across multiple modules (ex: 1 course can have 8 modules)

*         Way to store student test results

*         Way to automatically issue certification document

*         Bulk email capability to all student

*         Feedback form/survey

Can someone help me with my research?

Thanks in advance,
Kathy

Hi Kathy,

I have some blog posts that might be helpful--although I don't have answers to all your needs since my class runs a little differently than what it sounds like you're looking for.

But I have used WordPress as the LMS for a fully online honors seminar for college students several times now.

I've got a couple of posts about useful plugins here
http://prestidigitation.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2010/07/23/three-new-plugins/
and here
http://prestidigitation.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2010/03/15/kb-gradebook/

and a more thorough tech overview here
http://prestidigitation.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2010/01/31/alternate-worlds-part-2-the-class-begins/

Happy to discuss offlist if you want help or information.

Joe

Checked. With usage of an external plugin like S2Members or WPMU's 
membership plugin.

> ?Free lessons
>

Checked.

Half checked. Doesn't have implicit pass/fail result, just %. Multiple 
modules are called lectures.

> ?Way to store student test results

Checked. Per assignment gradebook with comments and notifications when a 
grade was updated.

>

No implicit support, but you can hook into an action and generate/email 
a document like that.

> ?Bulk email capability to all student
>

Checked. Through a mass-mailing BuddyPress plugin.

> ?Feedback form/survey

No implicit support but there are dozen of plugins like Contact Form 7 
and so on. There's full support for shortcodes though.

Hi there Kathy--

I've used WordPress for course websites for a diverse group of clients  
- from graduate professors to writers workshops and even alternative  
medicine schools.  Stas was succinct in saying that BuddyPress  
Courseware can pretty much cover what you need.  If you have any more  
specific questions, of course, feel free to ask this list more or even  
contact me directly.

Best of luck,

~kyle jones~

CALL FOR PANELISTS FOR WORDCAMP PHILLY 2011
Panel: WordPress as a Platform for Higher Education

Hello All -

On Saturday, November 5, WordCamp Philly 2011 is being held at the Fox
School of Business at Temple University (read more at read more at
http://2011.philly.wordcamp.org).

I am organizing a panel discussion on how WordPress is being deployed
in higher education. We are primarily interested in novel
implementations of the WordPress platform. We'd like panelists to
discuss their own WordPress implementation and discuss their thoughts
on how WordPress as a platform should evolve in order to best serve
the needs of Universities.

If you are interested in being a panelist, please contact me at
David.Schuff at temple.edu by October 7, 2011. It would be helpful to
send a link to your site along with a brief explanation of your
project. If you are selected as a panelist, we have travel grants
available to cover your hotel and meals during your stay in
Philadelphia.

Thanks!

Thank you for everyone's replies. I've been reading and becoming more familiar with the plugin options. I'm having a meeting this afternoon to discuss a game plan so hopefully I'll be given the permission to go forward. I'm excited about the possibilities and I'm sure I'll have more questions!

Thank you!
Kathy
