Good morning all,
What search solution/plugin are you using on your Wordpress site? The default WP search is lacking. Being in higher ed, we use a lot of PDFs, which the default search doesn't return. I have tried implementing Google Custom Search, but I need it to work with the default search box - not as a widget. (I can't have the search box say "Google custom search" within the search box)

Any help/advice would be appreciated.

Good evening,

As a newcomer to LTI and WordPress, which objectives are being advanced and perhaps fulfilled by such integration? Is the goal to push WP to provide analytics feedback in reports like the performance dashboard in LMS's? Trying to better understand how students and faculty benefit from this independent of where their data is hosted.

Hi David,

We run LTI on http://blogs.ubc.ca and integrated to Blackboard .

It's just a plugin. I think any host that allows you to install plugins and run Multisite you are good to go with.

WPEngine might be worth checking out?

Hi David,

>From what I?ve been reading Rackspace does not support wildcat subdomains, which means you?ll need to use sub-directories for mu, but if you?re leaning towards them, ask about that. Other cloud hosting services I?ve heard about include Amazon?s EC2 (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and vps.net<http://vps.net>, but this is only from what I?ve read and not from experience.

Subject: [wp-edu] Wordpress hosting with LTI integration

Hello WP-Edu-ers,

We are looking at integrating WordPress more tightly with our LMS via LTI (http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm).

Although we have our own internally hosted multisite instance that allows any of our users to serve themselves with new WP sites we are looking at cloud hosting that would provide the LTI integration.

Anyone have any experience with commercial WordPress hosters and/or LTI? If so any info you have would be appreciated.

Thanks,

David

Are you using the Download Monitor<https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-monitor/> plugin? It uses a custom post type for each entry, so you will get better results if your downloads are included among all post types.

Thx ? Steve

PS ? Would you happen to be related to Hall of Fame bowler Joe Berardi (1980s), from Brooklyn and Pearl River, NY?
