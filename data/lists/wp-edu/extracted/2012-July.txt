Greetings,

Is anyone out there using the Jetpack suite of plugins?

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/

It looks like it scratches a number of social media itches (with LaTeX thrown in as the cherry on top), but I'm curious about how it worked for folks. In particular, I'm wondering how the API key scaled up. It looks as though you need to create a key for each site separately (unlike Akismet) and while that will work fine for one off sites, I expect it becomes a challenge in multisite environments with dozens or hundreds of web sites.

Related to my previous post, I'm wondering if any colleges that used (or rather, tried to us) JetPack encountered errors connecting to the service. 

I've experimented with it on a personal site, and it worked just fine, but when I tried it on my dev site at the college, it failed with this error:

"Jetpack could not contact WordPress.com: register_http_request_failed. This usually means something is incorrectly configured on your web host".

After finding this thread: 

http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/jetpack-register_http_request_failed-how-do-i-fix-this

we tried curling maneuver it suggested, and got back an error message of "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"  along with an error of 

{"error":"home_missing","error_description":"The required \"home\" parameter is missing."}

I realize that this mailing lists for more general discussion topics, and not support requests, but a lot of the research we've done turns up problems with hosted sites on third party providers, not folks who do their hosting in house like many colleges do.

I've used it and it works great. But someone correct me if I am wrong, I don't thing Jetpack uses API keys anymore.

Sorry, I misspoke -- it requires a WordPress.com account.

Subject: [wp-edu] WordPress and Drupal comparison - Your help requested
Message-ID: <81983B40-514B-454E-96A9-B51BF4F27450@thecompass.com>

Folks-

For several years, I've been maintaining a CMS features comparison for WordPress and Drupal. (It's been very helpful when I'm asked to recommend the best CMS to match a school's needs. For some time now, it's been WP, but this comparison helps me dig into the criteria and continue to make the best recommendation.) 

The document is public, and there are 6 sheets focusing on Software, Production, Publishing, Collaboration, Events, and Forms:

	<http://bit.ly/Mx7wuM>

I'm currently in the midst of my annual update. However, although I have current WP experience, I have not worked deeply with Drupal 7 yet. If you or a colleague have been using Drupal 7 in production for a school, college, or university, would you be willing to take a look at the comparison sheets and add your knowledge about the features that are supported in core and modules? This will work on the honor system, and I'll keep an eye on revisions and annotations if there is disagreement.

Also, the lists of colleges and universities using WordPress and Drupal are here; I hope you'll update your own school's entry:

	WordPress: <http://bit.ly/IMh151>
	Drupal: <http://bit.ly/eMz36b>

Thanks, in advance, for taking the time.

-Jay

The only thing I can think of is to have the Jetpack options copied from the main site over to all other sites using a plugin like http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yd-wpmu-sitewide-options/, and then have the plugin auto activated when each subsite is registered. Your mileage may vary depending on the size of your network.

Jetpack currently requires you to connect each site individually. Copying
options won't work; it has to do with the connection made with WP.com and
data created on their side. You can use the same WP.com account, but I've
found that there's no good way to script the connections of an entire
network. I sent a note to one of the Jetpack guys to ensure they see this
thread.
