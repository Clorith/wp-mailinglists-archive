Subject: [wp-edu] WordPress for iOS app-- does it work with multisite?
In-Reply-To: <1498151739.96185.1375884859846.JavaMail.root@ganesh.brynmawr.edu>

Dear all, 
Have any of your users had luck using the WordPress for iOS app with your multisite installs? Ours have been having some problems. I tried to post a question to the WordPress for iOS forums first, but get an error any time I try to post, so I am hoping some of you have experience with this app, particularly since wp-edu users are more likely to have similarly large multisite installs. 

Whenever any of our iOS device users try to add a second blog within our multisite install (blogs.brynmawr.edu), the app gets stuck at "Reading blog options" and fails to add the blog. 


We're on WordPress 3.5.1 and trying this with the latest version of the iOS app (tried on a couple of different iPads and an iPhone 5 with the same result). 


What happens: 
- I can add one blog (say, techbar.blogs.brynmawr.edu) just fine. 
- That one blog appears correctly, except for the Site Title, which is always the title of the first blog in the user's list of sites, regardless of which blog I add. 
- If I try to add a second blog within the same multisite install (say, facultypublications.blogs.brynmawr.edu) , it hangs on "reading blog options" forever. 
- Adding the main blog (just blogs.brynmawr.edu) first doesn't seem to help. 


What we've tried: 
- This looks similar to some older forum posts such as http://ios.forums.wordpress.org/topic/iphone-app-crashes-when-adding-a-blog?replies=32 but that's not quite our setup and the post implies that that particular issue has been patched...? 
- Our XMLRPC settings appear to be correct per the app FAQ 
- The debugger http://dev.ios.wordpress.org/extra-debug/ log files don't seem to reveal an error or crash. 


It looks like the app is intended to work with multisite, but I'm not sure if we have something oddly configured (our install is certainly old enough to have some quirks), or if the app isn't currently playing well with multisite (or larger multisite installs)? 




Thank you, 
Juliana

I don't have very many users working with the iOS app, but it definitely does work with our multisite install.  Adding the first blog works (and the title is correct) and adding additional blogs is also fine.  We're on 3.6, if that matters. (latest version of the app).

The only hint I can give in what is basically a "works for me" response (don't you hate those?), is that we are on a subdirectory, not a subdomain, multisite install.  (largish install with +3000 users and sites).

Subject: [wp-edu] protecting uploaded files from direct download (multisite)
Message-ID: <08F5A706-184D-4EB4-B748-44A92CDCEA1E@mhc.cuny.edu>

Has anyone found a good solution for this?

Here's the basic scenario.  A class site wants to post links to class readings (as PDFs) for the students to download and read.  The instructor has copyright permission (or fair use exemption) to copy and distribute these readings to the class--but not to share them with the whole wide internet.

So she uploads the files, puts the links on a separate page, and password-protects that page.  Then she gives the password for that page to the class, so the students can all get the files. 

So far, so good, but the problem is that even though the page is password-protected, the uploaded files are not.  So anyone who has the direct link can download those files without knowing the password. And google does index the content of pdf files, so it's very possible, in fact likely, that someone googling (for example) the author's name or some terms in the document will come across that direct link.

I've tried as many of the .htaccess tricks for preventing this as I can find.  This looked like the best guide http://perishablepress.com/creating-the-ultimate-htaccess-anti-hotlinking-strategy/ but I tried many others.

None of them seem to work at all for multisite.  They don't stop the problem in any way.

If you've got a tip or trick, I'd love to hear about it!  I'd be happy with a solution that would work for the enitre network...or just for specific sites.  I'm OK with just about anything that will work!

Thanks!

Joe

Hey Joseph,

You might want to check out Ben Balter's Document Revisions, which has
support for storing files outside of the web root:

Joseph,

Protecting the link on a page is a common problem in membership solutions.
The best way to so this is to use a plugin that generates an expiring URL
and pulls the files from Amazon's S3 service <http://aws.amazon.com/> . S3
is really cheap and the plugins are relatively cheap. There are a lot of
them on the market; however, I would use S3 Media
Maestro<http://www.s3mediamaestro.com/>($27 for a single site)

Also note you can deliver, and protect audio and video with these plugins
(players are built-in).

Grant

Thanks to all!  Daniel's solution (wp-document-revisions) looks perfect for all needs.  If others are exploring the other options, here's some of what I've determined in my testing of the other plugins and suggestions.

WordPress Download Manager--two major drawbacks.  First, it exposes ALL files on the entire server to every user.  I was able to edit that feature out of the admin panel, but would have to do so again on every update.  Second (and worse from my perspective), it really does not protect the uploaded files.  It hashes the filename for the download link, but anyone who has that direct link can still download without knowing the password.

Download Monitor--Limits downloads to logged in members (of specific user groups if wanted).  But has no provision for allowing non-logged in users with a password to download the files.  We sometimes want to give people access to downloading the files, but don't want to create accounts for them on our system.

User Access Manager--works by rewriting the htaccess file on the uploads directory.  In my earlier testing, this method did not work at all for multisite installs.  Might be that the plugin does it better, but using it post facto (as we would have to) would eliminate all usable links from previously available downloads.  That warning, and the fact that it asks to rewrite databases upon install, made me nervous.

WP-Document-Revisions looks like the best bet, for us.  The combination of a large (3000+ sites/users) multisite install and the need for real secure protection, not just obscurity, seems to be best filled by this plugin.  It also does much more, and the name "Document Revisions" doesn't include the main feature we're using it for, but that's something we can explain to users.

It's interesting that this isn't something included in WordPress at this point.  And it's also interesting that so many of the proposed solutions don't work at all in multisite.  I think most people assume that a link on a password-protected page is also protected, or at least not indexed by google. Especially if they're using a plugin which is supposed to manage downloads. Testing with a direct link in a separate (not-logged-in, no password entered, no cache existing) browser will almost always allow direct download of those "protected" files.

Somewhat troubling!

Not much to look at in this plugin documentation. Can't say much on behalf
of myself.

Haven't considered it, but it looks like won't really do what we're looking for.  We want the sites to be public and open in most cases, just to protect certain files that are uploaded to the sites.  Thanks for the suggestion, though!

We sometimes want to give people access to downloading the files, but don't want to create accounts for them on our system.

Might be that the plugin does it better, but using it post facto (as we would have to) would eliminate all usable links from previously available downloads.  That warning, and the fact that it asks to rewrite databases upon install, made me nervous.

The combination of a large (3000+ sites/users) multisite install and the need for real secure protection, not just obscurity, seems to be best filled by this plugin.  It also does much more, and the name "Document Revisions" doesn't include the main feature we're using it for, but that's something we can explain to users.

I think most people assume that a link on a password-protected page is also protected, or at least not indexed by google. Especially if they're using a plugin which is supposed to manage downloads. Testing with a direct link in a separate (not-logged-in, no password entered, no cache existing) browser will almost always allow direct download of those "protected" files.

Message-ID: <B5E1D1DF8BFBDF49847A5A38C86C4BBF2F86D1@exmb2>

Hi all,
I am finally doing an overdue update of our WordPress multisite install (http://commons.trincoll.edu) and realize our old version of Post Indexer (comment indexer as well) is no longer working.
This is a paid plugin from WPMU-DEV. WPMU-DEV only offers a $99 month subscription which is a bit steep. We do use a number of their plugins and themes though.
2 questions for the list:

1.       Do you subscribe to WPMU-DEV and do you feel it is worth the cost?

2.       Do you know of any free or cheap alternatives to Post Indexer to create a stream of recent posts across your network?
Thanks
dave

David,

We're using this:

It's free? and works pretty well. I'm not sure it does comments, though.

Hi Dave,

I work for WPMU DEV (and sister company Edublogs) and we're happy to help
here.

We do have a yearly option, though it may be harder to find as we're in the
middle of changing our pricing structure.

For any university or school interested, one year is $419 and you'd be
grandfathered in forever at this pricing. This includes all 100+ of our
premium plugins, access to our support team, and community (where quite a
few folks from universities hang out).

If interested, feel free to let me know and I'll get you all setup. We can
handle it through PO's/checks offline so you don't have to use the
automated system if that helps you out.

Thanks!

Ronnie -

I am glad to hear that you are reconsidering your pricing model.

I have had a number of heated exchanges with individuals at WPMU about the quandary you put small independent WP developers like myself in by forcing me (and by association, my small clients) to subscribe to blanket access to all of your products in order to access just ONE plugin. Specifically, I needed a plugin to clone template blogs in a multisite environment and I ended up going to a competitor of yours because their pricing model was in alignment with every other commercial plugin vendor. Yes, I am aware of the support component, but I have never had a problem with support with other commercial vendors.

I feel very strongly about WPMU making their plugins available a la carte. WPMU benefits from the opensource culture of improvement, feedback, innovation, and instant implementation in the market. Your pricing model, however, is more like a cable TV system (which has its plusses and minuses, depending on whether you want ESPN or not). This is fine if there are no other alternatives with different pricing models. Unfortunately for WPMU, there are a slew of alternatives and I suspect you may get drowned out of the market in the long run much like SONY did with Betamax vs. VHS, event though Betamax was a far superior product.

Thank you for listening.

Thx ? Steve

Hi David (et all)

I've just gone through the exact same change for University of Copenhagen's Multisite install.
You're really looking for a replacement for the plugin "recent posts" - which in WPMU dev's version uses Post Indexer to run.

I've replaced Recent posts with the free plugin "Network Latest Posts" which does the job. It has a settings widget to fiddle with options:
http://en.8elite.com/network-latest-posts/

Background: I wanted to leave WPMUdevs service, as I was only using 3 plugins (the 2 above and privacy) - And I had an unfortunate incident with Privacy being updated, suddenly NOT keeping things private - and got fairly useless response from WPMUdev - and ended up simply downgrading. For something that a pricey - not good enough...


Best regards
Annette

Subject: [wp-edu] WordPress standalone html websites
Message-ID: <CE439789.12F50%bharwood@skidmore.edu>

Has anyone ever created an offline copy of a WordPress site that can be viewed as a standalone html website? A colleague has some beautiful sites that she'd like to take down yet preserve for offline viewing independent of WordPress. Short of printing all the materials out, it doesn't seem possible. Years ago, I used the free version of WinHTTrack website copier to create static copies of MovableType blogs. That solution worked great then but not so on WordPress multisite. Even when the sites are made public. Couldn't find any plugins that do this successfully either.  Thanks for any suggestions.

Best,

The unix tool wget has an archive option, which you can use for this sort of thing. It may not produce a perfect site but it will help get you there.?

I have not, but I have used the really static plugin, and I think it can
help in this instance: http://wordpress.org/plugins/really-static/

Just use it to create static html of the website while still keeping the
structure, and then move the static files to the root of the domain.

I recommend that your colleague install WAMP<http://www.wampserver.com/en/> (Windows) or MAMP<http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html> (Mac), which are Windows/Mac + Apache + MySQL + PHP. The Mac version is pretty easy to install. The Windows version less so from what I have seen.

WAMP/MAMP produces the same hosted environment that WP websites run on except off of your laptop. This is the conventional sandbox setup for development, and it is not taxing on your computer. It does not run unless you launch it.

Once you configure the settings, just drop the entire original website directory into the designated site location parent directory. You will have to do some changes to the database to point everything locally instead of the original hosting location, but it does not require any major coding skills (mostly a wholesale search & replace).

It is not dirt simple to do, but once you have it setup and the routine figured out, you can run a WP website locally for demonstrations or archival purposes as though it were live. Your browser URL would simply go from http://schmo.college.edu (or whatever) to http://localhost/schmo

This method preserves the fundamental WP "guts" (avoiding HTML translation), and allows you to modify it for whatever needs you might have using the WP dashboard as usual.

Thx ? Steve

The unix tool wget has an archive option, which you can use for this sort of thing. It may not produce a perfect site but it will help get you there.

We were using GetLeft<http://sourceforge.net/projects/getleftdown/>, but have switched to

wget -m -p -E -k -w 2 -erobots=off -Dword.emerson.edu <<blog url goes here>>

That may not be the final command ? I think our guy is still tinkering with it. He is also writing us a program that will let us dump in a list of the urls of the blogs we want to archive, runs wget on them automatically, and stores the html files in folders on our internal storage.

Has anyone ever created an offline copy of a WordPress site that can be viewed as a standalone html website? A colleague has some beautiful sites that she'd like to take down yet preserve for offline viewing independent of WordPress. Short of printing all the materials out, it doesn't seem possible. Years ago, I used the free version of WinHTTrack website copier to create static copies of MovableType blogs. That solution worked great then but not so on WordPress multisite. Even when the sites are made public. Couldn't find any plugins that do this successfully either.  Thanks for any suggestions.

I have not, but I have used the really static plugin, and I think it can
help in this instance: http://wordpress.org/plugins/really-static/

Just use it to create static html of the website while still keeping the
structure, and then move the static files to the root of the domain.

We've been using SiteSucker, a Mac app that can crawl a website, download
supporting media files, and localize links and media references within HTML
files. You can limit the crawler to a specific subdirectory or subdomain,
too.

What issue are you having with HTTrack? Some plugins like Better WP Security can block HTTrack and other bots (including wget) in the .htaccess from even accessing your site. But HTTrack will only spider what it knows about - that is, there needs to be a link to a specific subsite. Otherwise it won't find it.

It's only capturing the site index page but not subpages with images and other files like pdfs. I'm setting it to index the whole site. HTTrack should be able to crawl and index everything as these sites are publicly viewable.

Sitesucker is a mac app that I used when I had a server issue that crashed php every few hours. I pulled down a static copy, pointed the server to the folder it was in, and was able to troubleshoot the Wordpress Install on the side.  Very easy

A colleague has some beautiful sites that she'd like to take down yet preserve for offline viewing independent of WordPress. Short of printing all the materials out, it doesn't seem possible. Years ago, I used the free version of WinHTTrack website copier to create static copies of MovableType blogs. That solution worked great then but not so on WordPress multisite. Even when the sites are made public. Couldn't find any plugins that do this successfully either.  Thanks for any suggestions.

+1 for SiteSucker.  (Hi, Rob!)

I used it recently to archive a whole bunch of old sites (some WP, some drupal, some mediawiki).  In some cases there were little gaps and holes (usually in sites that included very complicated navigation with external links and in some sites that included flash media).  But overall it worked really well.

The overall archive is here if you want to browse how things turned out.

http://macaulay.cuny.edu/seminars/

(the process did memorialize some database errors from sites that had not been updated in a long time.  But that's a separate issue.  If I had fixed those errors or upgraded those sites before sucking them down, that problem wouldn't have arisen)

HTTrack, and other tools like it, work by following links on a site. If there isn't a link to a specific page or area of the site, HTTrack won't find it, even if it's publically accessible. But if there are links, then it may be a settings issue. You might check the HTTrack forum ( http://forum.httrack.com/ ) as there's nothing particular about WordPress in this regard.

It's only capturing the site index page but not subpages with images and other files like pdfs. I'm setting it to index the whole site. HTTrack should be able to crawl and index everything as these sites are publicly viewable.

What issue are you having with HTTrack? Some plugins like Better WP Security can block HTTrack and other bots (including wget) in the .htaccess from even accessing your site. But HTTrack will only spider what it knows about - that is, there needs to be a link to a specific subsite. Otherwise it won't find it.

Subject: [wp-edu] WordPress standalone html websites

Has anyone ever created an offline copy of a WordPress site that can be viewed as a standalone html website? A colleague has some beautiful sites that she'd like to take down yet preserve for offline viewing independent of WordPress. Short of printing all the materials out, it doesn't seem possible. Years ago, I used the free version of WinHTTrack website copier to create static copies of MovableType blogs. That solution worked great then but not so on WordPress multisite. Even when the sites are made public. Couldn't find any plugins that do this successfully either.  Thanks for any suggestions.

Best,
Ben

Select the directory, how deep you want to go, how many links to follow. And, localizes all internal links.
