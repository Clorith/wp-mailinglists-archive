Subject: [wp-edu] Image upload error (500) on some computers, but not others
Message-ID: <BANLkTimFJ21Xofuq=eG-Uxi9TAuOOEH7PA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

We've encountered a very strange error and I was wondering if any of you had
encountered it and knew the solution.

On some computers (the only one we know the OS for sure on is a Win7Pro)
when users try to upload files through the media library using the Flash
uploader small red text appears that says HTTP Error (or once IO Error).
When using Browser uploader, we get a 500 Internal Server Error. It happens
on all browsers across the computers we've had it reported on. However, I've
tested it on WinXP, OSX, and Win7Ultimate and the same error will not occur,
images upload without any problem.

 The error started happening less than a week ago, before which there were
no problems. As far as we know, no alterations have been made to WordPress.

Anyone have any ideas as to why this is happening?

This old note from Otto might help:

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/25-imagemedia-uploader-problems

Browser cache, faulty flash plugin, php versions, file permissions. Try switching to the manual uploader too. I've seen things with mod_security (or selinux) cause some browser/os specific error 500 issues. You might really need to look through ALL the logging for your web server to track this down.

Subject: [wp-edu] WP Education Solution needed
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=hTkWMLR0-2Yprsc7cJA=7wf8BmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Just born in the WP-Edu world. Was searching for WP Learning Management
System and came to know about this great group WP-EDU. I want to setup LMS
for my client for that i want to see the demo of WP-EDU. I could not find
anywhere of it. Still i have doubt wither in WP-Edu we discuss how we can
use WP as learning management system or we actually have some plugin like
WP-Edu which provides LMS functionality and here we discuss customization of
it..

Thanks for reading this. Help me to get started with WP-Edu

Thanks
Bhavin Shah
