Subject: [wp-edu] Shibboleth Authentication
Message-ID: <CACDB3B3.9ADF%jeffvand@unc.edu>

We had a bit of fun trying recently to get Shibboleth to work here at UNC with the latest version and ended up modifying the shibboleth plugin with some new features.

For those that are interested my colleague, John, wrote up something about what we did here and put out a patch for anyone interested.
