Greetings fellow WordPress users,

I have three internal clients that could benefit from a smoother process to allow their clients to upload photos for diagnostic and identification purposes, e.g. identify bugs or diagnose turfgrass or plant problems.

All three WordPress sites are on a multisite, and all three currently have Gravity Forms contact forms. The upload limit is the same throughout the multisite - 6MB. This limit works for our current internal users.

The current method to protect the server is to have clients email the photos separately, and then the photos must be manually matched to the form information. 

I am concerned about two things regarding allowing file uploads from external users:
1) the possibility of malicious files being uploaded
2) the possibility of users uploading files at higher than 72dpi, and quickly filling up disk quota - I would prefer not to punish the internal users by lowering the disk quota across the multisite

Has anyone have insights to share on how to balance upload convenience, server safety and disk quota?

Thanks in advance for any guidance you are willing to share.

Hi Dixie,

It looks like Gravity forms has hooks and filters you could use to 
create functions to limit the file types and maximum file size: 
http://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/page/Developer_Docs#Hooks_and_Filters

There are plugins that can do so as well: 
http://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-advanced-file-uploader/

Contact Form 7 also allows you to specify file types and sizes: 
http://contactform7.com/file-uploading-and-attachment/

Best,

Caroline

Consider looking at the Smushit plugin:

http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/

It's been taken over by WPMU, which is a good thing. I don't know if it can impose a file size limit, but it might at least automatize the optimizing process so that no one has to be "smart" about it.

I use this plugin. One thing is that the original image has to be 1MB or 
less.

Hi Dixie,

Thanks! I am going to New Zealand.

If you need any help with implementing file upload limits or anything else, I can give helping a shot. I'm getting more into doing WordPress development, so every experience helps.

Best,

Caroline

Subject: [wp-edu] Recommendations on multisite search
Message-ID: <0N8T009EK2JHAD40@gummo.its.uwo.pri>

Hi WPED-ers,

 

I'm interested in any recommendations you have on search engines for multisite. 

 

I understand Google CSE can be used, and also see that WPMU has a multisite indexer and search engine combo as well. Are there others you would recommend we consider? Is Google CSE the solution you are using, and if so is it integrated via a plugin?

 

Thanks for any advice you can give!

Hi Dixie,

Thanks! I am going to New Zealand.

If you need any help with implementing file upload limits or anything else, I can give helping a shot. I'm getting more into doing WordPress development, so every experience helps.

Best,

Caroline

I'm currently working on creating reports for our departments on how their websites have been faring since our migration to WordPress took place about 6 months ago and was curious to hear about what you all consider to be good goals or metrics to measure.
