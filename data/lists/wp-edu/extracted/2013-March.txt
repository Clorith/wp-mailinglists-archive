Subject: [wp-edu] Open source release of BU-developed WP plugins
Message-ID: <634F9DDC-30AC-4815-A3DF-AB68229C7A7C@bu.edu>

Dear Colleagues,

I'm happy to announce the open source availability of three WordPress plugins developed at Boston University. The features offered by these plugins have allowed Boston University to effectively use WordPress as a CMS on a very large scale, with robust tools for managing hierarchical page content, granular control over who can edit what content, and workflow to stage edits and revisions to existing content.

The plugins are free and available now on wordpress.org<http://wordpress.org/>, and are also available on Github if you want to customize them or further develop them in order to submit new features and/or enhancements.

BU Navigation Plugin<http://developer.bu.edu/bu-navigation/>: We always found the native WordPress tools for managing hierarchical page content to be lacking. Re-ordering pages was a chore, and managing your navigation menus separately was not efficient. With BU Navigation, you can tame even the most unruly site structures. With two lines of code any theme can benefit from this feature-rich custom menu alternative.

BU Section Editing Plugin<http://developer.bu.edu/bu-section-editing/>: We needed a way to allow individual site administrators to manage their staff's editing permissions without exposing the complexities of WordPress roles and capabilities. With BU Section Editing, you have crowd control for WordPress. Create section editing groups, assign editors to a group, and granularly define what content members of that group can edit.

BU Versions Plugin<http://developer.bu.edu/bu-versions/>: We needed a mechanism so editors could save edits to published content without it immediately replacing the live page, so the edits could be reviewed and approved. With BU Versions, you can clone, edit, and replace. Seamlessly. Now you can implement a workflow that's easy to use and "behind the scenes" without disruptive or unreviewed changes to your live content.

Boston University first started using WordPress in Fall 2008 to replace a home-grown CMS used by our medical campus to host 137 sites. In March 2013, we will launch our 800th WordPress-based website. We've developed our own WordPress theme framework that supports a curated collection of standard University designs for hundreds of sites as well as dozens of custom themes for our highest-profile and most-trafficked sites. With WordPress, and through a close collaboration between development and design teams at BU, we offer web publishing services to hundreds of University departments that are low-cost, easy to use, and deliver a consistent user experience to visitors on the BU Web.

We invite you to download our plugins, and perhaps your college or university (or even you personally!) can benefit from these new features we have developed for WordPress. And finally, stay tuned -- we plan to share more of our WordPress work in the future.

Best Regards,
Ron

Ron,

That's awesome, congratulations on integrating WordPress into the
enterprise like you have at BU. It was only a matter of time before all the
work folks have done with WP starts getting the credit it deserves, and
freely available plugins to boot, it was almost as if universities had
something to offer the WordPress community. Go figure :)

Best,
Jim

Subject: [wp-edu] Great Frontend Posting Solution for Wordpress
Message-ID: <1377ACF0B3F8FF48BA5C8AD153784B0E0731E5@hscmbx6.uthsc.tennessee.edu>

Hi everyone,

One seemingly essential feature that Wordpress doesn't have out-of-the box is a robust front-end posting solution for user generated content.
We want users to be able to login and submit posts, categorize and tag them, add meta data and upload images. Users need to be able to edit and delete their posts (Prior to being published by someone with the appropriate capabilities).
We wanted this all to be handled on the front end partly to avoid the need for users to interact with the Wordpress backend interface but also because restricting backend access alleviates a lot of security concerns.

Surprisingly, there aren't a lot of plugins that fulfil this need. We looked at Gravity Forms, which is a great plugin, but it is not made to handle frontend posting and lacks a lot of features that would make it a viable solution.
Perhaps the reason that there aren't a lot of plugins for this is because the best one has pretty much covered everything.
Enter WP User Frontend.
While the free version of WPUF<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-user-frontend/> is great, a completely revised premium version<http://wedevs.com/plugin/wp-user-frontend-pro/> was released in the past week or so that adds many of the critical features that aren't available in the free version.
WPUF is a full frontend posting solution complete with a frontend dashboard, frontend posting and editing interfaces with support for multiple forms for custom post types and more.
It  also handles capability settings like backend restriction and works well with the User Role Editor plugin and the Active Directory plugin we are using. Users must be logged in to submit posts and posts are automatically attributed to the user.
We are currently working with the free version with some minor modifications; the developer has provided plenty of hooks with documentations to allow the plugin to be extended to do just about anything. The most noticeable difference in the pro version is the essential ability to create multiple forms, which allows users to submit different types of posts.

Our ultimate goal is to launch a news site that allows faculty, staff, and students to login and contribute news stories with images, categorize and tag them, indicate whether they should appear on listservs and whether they should be featured. The posts are submitted, by default, as pending review and are not published until they are edited by users with backend access. Once the story is submitted, the user can edit or delete it via a front-end dashboard, but once the post is published, they are no longer able to modify it.

Hope this helps; we're very happy with the plugin so I thought I'd share...

Message-ID: <CD78A244.12AF4%steve.covello@granite.edu>

Regarding a front-end posting solution.

We have been utilizing a front-end posting solution for about 6 months now on a WP multisite instance, based on Gravity Forms. We are also using the following add-ons:

GF Custom Post Types (maps form content to CPT custom fields)
GF Update Post
GF WYSIWYG (adds WYSIWYG to text area)

Using the Custom Fields block and the Post blocks, we have been able to automate user input into specific content fields, both CPT and standard post fields (title, excerpt, content, etc.), including file upload. There are hidden fields that automate which Category a post will go into upon submission, post order (custom field plus a modified loop), and some other functions.php hacks to draw content from one field and copy it into another post field with alternate formatting (such first name/last name field into Title).

This, in combination with the Adminimize plugin has allowed us to create a stripped down, super easy student e-portfolio system for students without the need for WordPress training. Still, post can be modified and updated in the backend if the user wants to, but so far, no one has done it yet.

Here is the NERCOMP poster session<http://www.educause.edu/nercomp-annual-conference/2013/creating-prior-learning-assessment-e-portfolio-development-system-wordpress> (includes resources) I offered a couple weeks ago. Feel free to contact me directly if you would like a more in-depth explanation on how this done.

thx ? Steve

Hey All,  

I am wondering if anyone has any good protocol/plugins/etc. for testing updates to plugins/themes across large multisite installations.  Right now I am doing testing by hand, but it get's tedious and I'm sure I am going to miss some things.  

Ideally I'd love to create some tests that run and report back if things are working or not working. But any automation I can do at all would be great.  

Any thoughts would be appreciated.  

Thanks!

We're working on a suite of Selenium scripts for Drupal to do exactly this, and plan on doing that for WordPress as well. We don't have a timeline for this, but I'm hoping to have it done by the end of the summer.  We've recently moved to managing our WordPress installations with git; now that updates are a lot easier the next big time saving step is automating testing.

That is kind of what we were thinking as well.  If we decide to go that route we will certainly share with others. 

Thanks!!
