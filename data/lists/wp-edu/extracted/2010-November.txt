Subject: [wp-edu] Lots of domains, single sign-in
Message-ID: <23B966FA-8403-4F2F-A9AB-403EF4CE4395@berkeley.edu>

We have around 30 WordPress domains in a .edu environment and we need  
to get wp-admin behind https for all of them.  We can't get a separate  
IP for  each domain.

Using the university's CAS (central sign-in service) via a plugin  
would be an ideal solution, but we have many users with logins who are  
not part of the university. Facebook login would be another option,  
but this isn't ideal for various reasons.

The university network officials want us to find a way to redirect  
users to a single sign-in domain, then back to the domain they're  
logging into. My question is, how can this be done with WordPress?  
Does anyone have experience with this?

Thanks,
Scot

Scot,

I'm pretty sure UBC blogs does this very thing:

I would ask Novak Rogic how they did it. He rules, and you can find his

Hi Scot,

So you are trying to avoid SSL certificate error by using a single sign-on?

I doubt it will work because after the user login and being redirected to the original domain dashboard (/wp-admin) the URL will be https without certificate. Right?

This might not be the best way, but you could get an SSL cert that has
multiple domains in it. Go Daddy sells one that covers 100 domains for
$89.

I know it's not ideal, but we would probably keep the wp-admins on  
http. It's the user/password credentials that really need protecting.

We're also looking into the possiblity of using a multi-domain cert -  
just need to make sure that's compatible with cPanel.

Thanks,
Scot

I would just get an SSL that is compatible for all of your domains and then enforce SSL on login.

If the only concern is in ensuring the logins are all https, then you could get a wildcard cert for *.domain.edu. They're more expensive than single site certs, but still cheap and much more useful. Godaddy sells them for about $200.

MU/3.0MS sets the login cookie so that it works across all blogs on that site/domain, so users won't have to repeatedly authenticate. 

If you want to force all log-ins to go through a single page at a well known URL, you might want to check out the work I did for my previous employer:

http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/14110/wordpress-user-authentication-hacks/

There are some good reasons to send everybody through the same auth page, but I'd balance that against the effort necessary to make it work. Especially if a wildcard cert will solve your immediate problem (and won't hurt later if you decide to invest more time).

Subject: [wp-edu] Hosting WordCamps
Message-ID: <4CE17B75.9090002@automattic.com>

One of the biggest hurdles for organizing a WordCamp in any city is 
finding a venue. Ideally, venues are donated, so that the organizers can 
focus on content rather than raising lots of money for room rentals, and 
one of the best sources of venue donation is college and university 
campuses. They tend to have various room sizes, projectors, etc. and are 
usually easy to get to. Since academia is a growing area of WordPress 
use, it frequently happens that hosting a WordCamp at a college campus 
is possible because someone at the college wanted to be involved in 
bringing a WordCamp to their school. A faculty member who wants his/her 
department to host/sponsor a WordCamp has built-in access to facilities 
and services, while an outside organizer would be handed off to 
conference rentals, when what is usually appealing about campuses is the 
classroom format.

Why am I telling you this? If you are on this list, chances are you're 
using WordPress in an academic setting. Some WordCamps, like New York 
City, feature an academic track due to close collaboration with college 
personnel, and I'd like to see this trend continue.

If you work for a college with a campus that would make a good setting 
for a WordCamp and would be interested in getting involved, let me know. 
I can try to put you together with local people who are also interested 
in organizing a WordCamp. Whether you try to include an academic track 
or not, bringing WordCamp to your campus has benefits on all sides.

While I'm at it, is anyone here affiliated with any San Francisco 
universities? :)

I'm a Senior Analyst at BCIT and would be interested in spearheading
something here as well.  Perhaps, given Michael's interest, a lower mainland
Word-edu-Camp might be doable.

We haven't gone as far down the Wordpress road as UBC, but do have it in
place and are slowly moving forward.  I'm trying to push forward with a
Wordpress strategy, so a WordCamp would be ideal!

Jane,

I'd be interested in learning more in order to get the University of Alabama involved.

One of the biggest hurdles for organizing a WordCamp in any city is
finding a venue. Ideally, venues are donated, so that the organizers can
focus on content rather than raising lots of money for room rentals, and
one of the best sources of venue donation is college and university
campuses. They tend to have various room sizes, projectors, etc. and are
usually easy to get to. Since academia is a growing area of WordPress
use, it frequently happens that hosting a WordCamp at a college campus
is possible because someone at the college wanted to be involved in
bringing a WordCamp to their school. A faculty member who wants his/her
department to host/sponsor a WordCamp has built-in access to facilities
and services, while an outside organizer would be handed off to
conference rentals, when what is usually appealing about campuses is the
classroom format.

Why am I telling you this? If you are on this list, chances are you're
using WordPress in an academic setting. Some WordCamps, like New York
City, feature an academic track due to close collaboration with college
personnel, and I'd like to see this trend continue.

If you work for a college with a campus that would make a good setting
for a WordCamp and would be interested in getting involved, let me know.
I can try to put you together with local people who are also interested
in organizing a WordCamp. Whether you try to include an academic track
or not, bringing WordCamp to your campus has benefits on all sides.

While I'm at it, is anyone here affiliated with any San Francisco
universities? :)

Jane

	Issue 2 -- Hosting Education focused WordCamps

Hello Jane,

I would be interested in helping organize a WordCamp if possible focused on
using BuddyPress for internal social networks in schools.

I am a faculty member at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT)
in Burnaby and Capilano University in North Vancouver and could help with
arranging hosting at either school.  Looks like there is a lot of interest
in Vancouver area!

At BCIT, we have an interesting pilot project using BuddyPress for an
internal social network, bcitcommons.ca inspired by CUNY academic commons
and UMW blogs.  It would be great to gather together others that are using
WordPress/BuddyPress in this way and learn from each other.

Thanks,
Cyri Jones

Subject: [wp-edu] Boston universities?
Message-ID: <4CE9DEF2.7060601@automattic.com>

WordCamp Boston was being planned for April of 2011, and apparently has 
missed out on the venues they were pursuing. Anyone on this list from a 
school in Boston that might be able to host the WordCamp? It's the same 
organizing team as last year, when it was held at the NERD center at MIT.
