Subject: [wp-edu] Multisite on Amazon EC2 hosting
Message-ID: <971DCA1F-754A-440C-A2CA-A4B2B5B5E659@thecompass.com>

Is anyone running WP multisite on Amazon EC2 with BitNami Hosting management?

	<http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>
	<http://bitnami.org/cloud/product-tour>
	<http://bitnami.org/cloud/apps>

Bonus question: Is anyone serving a WP/EC2 site for viewing in China (i.e., cloned into the AWS Singapore availability zone)?

Subject: [wp-edu] BuddyCamp Vancouver 2012 Oct 14th and 15th!
Message-ID: <CAAXCtdgJR=FQPLdFjPBD9e+ifOmFZeijUyxUcFQKQi-GyqhC6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Are you using BuddyPress or thinking of using this "social network in a
box" tool for your campus site?

You won't want to miss the first-of-its-kind BuddyCamp Vancouver being held
at BCIT Burnaby Campus on Oct. 14th and 15th, 2012.  Oct. 14th will be
presentations from some excellent speakers including a number of the
BuddyPress core contributors and a number of speakers using BuddyPress
innovatively in education.  Oct. 15th will be a Hack Day with both
opportunities for developers and non-developers to participate.  The
non-developer track will focus on BuddyPress documentation or a beginners
guide to BuddyPress.

For more info:
http://2012.vancouver.buddypress.org/

We also still have a few slots available for speakers so if you are
passionate about BuddyPress and would like to participate as a speaker, we
would love to hear from you.  Please see our Call for Speakers page.
http://2012.vancouver.buddypress.org/call-for-speakers/

Finally, if your school has benefited from BuddyPress, maybe you could
consider being a sponsor for this not-for-profit, WordPress Foundation
supported event:
http://2012.vancouver.buddypress.org/sponsors/

Note: There will also be WordCamp Vancouver taking place on Oct. 13th, the
day before BuddyCamp. It will include a user and developer track.
http://2012.vancouver.wordcamp.org/  You could have three days of
WordPress/BuddyPress awesomeness!

Finally, many of you may know already this year's Open Education Conference
will be taking place in Vancouver from Oct. 16th to 18th so another great
event you may want to check out and perhaps combine with WordCamp and
BuddyCamp:
http://openedconference.org/2012/

Thanks,
Cyri

Folks-

Have you read Boone's post about WordPress in education?

	<http://teleogistic.net/2012/09/wordpress-in-education-meet-the-free-software-community-and-vice-versa/>

Thoughts?

Also, is the WP-Edu site in active development?

	<http://wp-edu.org/>

Hey Jay, 

Right now wp-edu.org is not currently be updated, but I do want to get working on that again.  We are super busy migrating for Oracle to Wordpress at UNC, but hope to get back to building up the site this fall. :)  

Thanks for the link to the post.  I had not read it. :)

I was reading a recent feed on the wp-edu listserv about the WordPress
Education website and I wanted to offer myself up for helping to get that
site back on track (when you are ready).  I currently work as Web Manager in
University Relation for UNC Greensboro and previously worked with Billy
Hylton at UNC in IT Services, so in both my current position and previous
positions (plus my knowledge of WP) I feel like I could really offer help
and a great perspective to how WP is being used in an educational
environment, specifically higher education.  UNCG is currently in the
middle phase of implementing a campus-wide LAMP environment, creating
campus themes and offering up WordPress as a supported website
creation/blogging platform for both students and faculty and I am directly
involved in that process.

I am not sure what your ideas or plans are for this site but I am very
interested in helping in any way that I can.

Thanks,

Danielle

Hello all,

Does anyone have a solution for this use case?

Given a subset of sites in our multi-site instance of WordPress, list the posts across those sites that have been specific tag or category.

Thanks,

David

Check out http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/switch_to_blog and http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Tag_Parameters

I'd do something like

foreach ( $blog_ids as $blog ) :
    switch_to_blog( $blog );
    $the_query = new WP_Query( 'tag=whatever-tag' );
    while ( $the_query->have_posts() ) :
        $the_query->the_post();
        sprintf( '<h1><a href="%s">%s</a></h1>', get_permalink(), get_the_title() );
	// more the_loop stuff here if you want
    endwhile;
endforeach;

The initial blog would need to be restored after the foreach block, but I can't say offhand if restore_current_blog() will restore it or the penultimate blog.

It obviously becomes less efficient the more blogs you switch to and the more posts you pull.

I'd recommend using the Sitewide Tags plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mu-sitewide-tags/) to create a Tags blog. This will, essentially, repost every public post in one place, maintaining information about the original author and permalink. Then you can grab a feed of the tag/category from the Tags blog. We use this at UMW to aggregate posts from around our entire multisite installation that use a particular course tag/category.

Beware of the switch_to_blog function -- it's all but deprecated and can cause performance issues.

HTH,
Martha

WordPress 3.5 is actually overhauling the switch_to_blog() function (
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21434) to fix some of those
performance issues so using it shouldn't be an issue but as mentioned this
could be slow if the multisite instance is large.
