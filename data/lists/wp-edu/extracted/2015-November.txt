Subject: [wp-edu] Seeking an embeddable map to display live downloads from a
	site
Message-ID: <CAKrE1qBifhMcZsQ+gG8iLthLNYY6-7mFvg5HCUP8OZqgz4kKHg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm seeking a embeddable map to display live downloads of documents from a
website a la http://academicworks.cuny.edu/ (scroll to the bottom). I've
seen this on bepress. However, I am not sure which plugin, if any based on
various descriptions, screenshots, and directions would actually do the
work of showing live downloads as they happen on a map.

Many thanks!
Jack

Jack,

Academic Works is not a Wordpress site, but is the Digital Commons proprietary platform created by BePress.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Stephen
