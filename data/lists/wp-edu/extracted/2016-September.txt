Subject: [wp-edu] Shibboleth on WordPress
Message-ID: <39a01c80c17a4bc78d8529a2dc035a64@exch15-mr03.tu.temple.edu>

Hello all,

We have a large WordPress multisite at our University. Currently, we are using a LDAP plugin to handle our authentication/authorization. Our Identity Management group wants everyone to move to Shibboleth if possible. We already have the IdP infrastructure.

The issue that concerns me is that the WordPress Shibboleth plugin [1] seems to be not very well maintained. On the GitHub repo for the plugin [2], there are pending pull requests from 2014 and 2015 and a handful of pending issues (including some that are multisite-specific). The majority of the pull requests and issues have no response from the committer/maintainer.

Is anyone else using Shibboleth for a WordPress multisite instance? Are you using a custom implementation or this plugin? I?m just looking for any feedback from anyone who is using it to see if it?s a worthy pursuit or if we should just stick with LDAP.

Thanks,
Steve Guglielmo

We installed/configured on a dev system back in 2014, but didn?t move forward at the time due to the fact that many of our users are not in LDAP.  We?d have to deal with directing people to the appropriate login, which we didn?t have a great solution for at the time.

We too are now being ?encouraged? to move applications to Shib, so we might be in a similar boat soon.

We're using Shibboleth with Wordpress multisite here at Mount Holyoke
College. I do have a custom fork of the plugin running, but not because of
any of the outstanding issues. We are part of a consortium with 4 other
colleges/universities and we needed a way to whitelist students from those
other colleges, as well as a handful of other exceptions. So, basically,
you're allowed into our Wordpress blog site if your account is a Mount
Holyoke account, or if you're enrolled in a class here from one of the
other 4 colleges, or if you're on a manually-maintained whitelist. The
difference between my fork of the plugin and the stock version is maybe 10
lines of code (which simply short-circuits the access check if your eppn is
contained within a particular MySQL table), so it's very easy to maintain.
If we didn't need this somewhat-specialized functionality, we could
probably get by with just the stock plugin. And there's probably some way I
could use Shibboleth itself to do this magic, but despite being my school's
Shibboleth administrator, it's still mostly a dark art to me.

We have been using the plugin for a few years at Brown.

Functionally, it has worked well.

The only issue that comes to mind is a confusing interface for adding
users. That is, administrators are sometimes confused when to add a new
user vs an existing user. We modified the "add user" screen to help, but
our changes are pretty Brown-specific.

Hi All,

We use Shibboleth Plugin (https://github.com/mitcho/shibboleth/) for our
wordpress service at New York University. There are not many options that
we could find out there and so use this plugin based on a number of
reasons. There is an alternative Miniorange SAML Plugin (
https://wordpress.org/plugins/miniorange-saml-20-single-sign-on/) which
works with Shibboleth Idp and is compartively easy to setup and is well
maintained. You need a Pro version for multisite, however their licensing
is a bit of an issue due to per site license policy.

I am in agreement that the plugin is less maintained, however it still
solves the purpose well for allowing Shibboleth authentication. It does
requires extra setup and config on server level initially and should be
good to go later. I have scanned through the pull requests and they are
good to have in the plugin and would recommend forking the repo and keep a
track of changes or new pull requests on the original github repo. That is
how we keep this plugin maintained for ourselves. We are working on few
customizations of ours as well and might send in pull requests for others
interested. One such use case is to restrict/disallow a certain set of
users from Shibboleth to access our wordpress service.

I am happy to discuss more if someone needs additional information related
to this.

Best,
Neel

Greetings,

I recently wrote an ebook (PDF format) - WordPress for Beginners: Step  
by Step Lessons.

It covers using WordPress for content creation and management.  It  
does not delve into themes and plugins or pure blogs.

In my past job, I worked for University of Wisconsin-Madison as a web  
developer, managing a WordPress multisite; designing and setting up  
faculty lab, student, and topical sites; and training faculty, staff,  
and students to maintain content.

I am now an independent consultant offering services in WordPress  
content management, training, and consulting for university faculty  
and staff.

If you would like a free copy of the ebook, please email me at:
shelldrakeconsulting at dixielang.com

Thanks and have a great day.

Sincerely,
- Dixie
