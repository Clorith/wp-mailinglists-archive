Hi all,

We are building an online social network and learning environment for young
people based all around the world. The core site runs off WordPress MU and
BuddyPress, and we are looking at how we can offer an e-learning suite
alongside the social element (with course achievements etc showing up on
users activity feeds...)

For course resources we would like to innovate this slightly by allowing
users to submit content to the 'knowledgebase', which can be tagged
according to the content it relates to: articles, videos, audio, quotes,
links, images, can all be uploaded by users. Content which is deemed good
enough quality that it contrubites towards revision/learning for a course
would be tagged by teachers with the course name/id. I envisioned having
each of these items as a WordPress post in a special blog, which would have
a custom theme to allow people to create content from the front-end
(P2-esk).

We then need some kind of course management tool, like Moodle, which would
allow us to record data on students, grades, courses etc. Any ideas whether
this could be created within WP/BP/bbress some how? I'm keen to keep it as
in-house as possible, because of integrations etc. The wordpress.org plugins
repo is built off bbPress, so it certainly is a powerful platform...

What I'm asking is; what's your thoughts on using WP for the applications
I've described, and how would you possibly use WP for a e-learning, course
management etc facility?

Cheers,
Alex

Hi everyone. I'm one of the organizers of WordCampNYC, to be held at  
Baruch College November 14-15, and I wanted to let you all know that  
we will have an Ed track at the event. It's getting the same amount of  
time as the blogger and dev tracks (and the 5 other tracks... it's a  
big event), and there are a couple of slots left on the program, so  
thought I'd post here for some suggestions and/or volunteer speakers.

Joe Ugoretz, Luke Waltzer and Mikhail Gershovich of CUNY have been  
consulting on topics, and will all be speaking in the Ed track, along  
with Jim Groom (Mary Washington), Matt Gold (CUNY Academic Commons),  
Jeremy Boggs and Dave Lester (GMU). Dave will be doing a live setup of  
a course site with the Courseware plugin with an audience member in  
need of a course site.

We're also mixing things up a bit and having some people who would  
traditionally be at WordCamp Ed events present in the mainstream  
tracks, to take advantage of the knowledge of the wider community and  
form more connections between the Academic WP community and the  
broader open source WordPress community. Casey Bisson and Boone Gorges  
will be presenting in the Developer, CMS, and BuddyPress/MU tracks to  
this end.

If you are in the NYC Metro area and are using WordPress in an  
interesting way in an academic setting and might be interested in  
presenting something, I'd love to hear from you. I'd especially love  
to add a woman or two to the program, as this is the only track that  
does not currently have any female speakers.

If you are from NYC or not too far away (and with the Acela, that's  
really anywhere from Boston to DC, right?), I hope you'll consider  
attending the event. So far only about 30 people have registered and  
indicated that they are interested in the Ed track. Given that  
previous WordCampEd events have pulled in 150 attendees easily, it  
would great to hit that level in NYC as well. The sooner people  
register, the easier it will be to assign rooms for the sessions. As a  
side note, our last t-shirt order will be placed the morning of  
November 4, so register before then to guarantee a t-shirt.

The event is only $40, lasts Saturday and Sunday from 9-6, includes a  
long-sleeved t-shirt and lunch on Saturday. More information about the  
programming of the event can be found at the web site: http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org 
. Matt Mullenweg, founder and project lead of WordPress, will be in  
attendance, and we're planning a roundtable discussion on the future  
of of WordPress in educational settings with him that I think will be  
really great. So register! Tell your colleagues! Spread the word!

Thanks. :)
