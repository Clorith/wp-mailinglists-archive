Hey All,

I have a question for you.  Our multi-site instance is growing quickly since we started it last year.  We have around 1200 sites now (http://web.unc.edu).  My question is about support.  It is quickly growing beyond my ability to provide support for all the sites myself.  We have a very distributed IT here on UNC-CH campus and I would like to give rights to some of the folks in the distributed departments to allow them to support their users better.

Has anyone else had a situation like this and what did y'all do to best manage it?  I am thinking of categorizing the departments using a plugin like WPMU's Blog Types - http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/blog-types.  And then giving certain users rights to edit sites that fall in a certain category.    I thought I would start with y'all before developing my own solution.

Thanks for any thoughts or leads you have.

Hey Jeff,

That sounds like it could be pretty useful. If you do go forward with it,
I'd like to hear how it goes.
