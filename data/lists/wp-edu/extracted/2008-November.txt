Subject: [wp-edu] Wordpress vs Wordpress MU for a school website?
Message-ID: <4911F343.2020504@novapages.com>

Hi all, or whoever might be signed up so far at least....  Is anyone 
else in here using WordPress for an elementary school website? 

I need to get my kids' school site off Joomla, and I'm debating whether 
I need to go with WordPress MU so different departments can manage their 
own stuff.  I'd definitely envisioned using multiple blogs with sub 
categories to achieve different content management functions.  The 
'hundreds of thousands' of blogs bit sounds like MU would be overkill... 
as we need no more than 10 here.  But I'm curious as to how that works.

If anyone's got this going for their school, would you mind sharing your 
url and your experience?

I'm still somewhat new to WordPress, so pardon my ignorance... I'm 
hoping I'll catch up quickly :o)  Thank you, and thanks to automattic 
for making this list, too.

I don't have any examples of WordPress for elementary schools, but  
don't let the "hundreds of thousands" part of WPMU scare you off. It's  
really "more than 1, and up to hundreds of thousands." WPMU is really  
just WordPress with a few more options to configure and stuff to  
monitor, but it really can make managing multiple sites simple. Or, at  
least, simpler than managing a bunch of separate standalone sites...

The service I run for the University of Calgary now has a few blogs  
running on it, with everything from student's personal blogs to full  
courses being run in it. Also, we can configure the privacy levels for  
each blog, ranging from fully open to viewable by members only.

Velda,

Even if it is ten different sites, it would be a lot of work to update
and keep th plugins consistent for ten separate wordpress install.  I
would recommend simply for ease of updating and installing several
sites within one install.  However, if you are going to try and make
several department sites on one blog that is different.

Best,
Jim

Velda,

I second Jim's suggestion. I had implemented WPMU for Humanities
department intructors in Michigan Tech a while ago. Though the
hope was that there would hundreds of users, reality was that
we only got about 15 users to register and use it for teaching
purposes. 

I have now set it up for a friend who writes three blogs - trust
Jim (and me), it's lot easier to update (WP and plugins and themes)
in WPMU than in 10 different installations of WP.

Best,
gowtham

Velda,

Welcome to the list!

As D'Arcy pointed out, WordPress MU doesn't have to be used for
hundreds of thousands of blogs, but definitely has the potential to do
so (we use it with WordPress.com). It gives you extra control and
takes a lot of the work out of managing a series of blogs. It would
work very well for what you're describing and shouldn't present any
significant technical challenges.

Several departments using one blog is not that complicated. A
different theme could be used for each department and it would still
be much less complicated than managing 10 or 15 different blogs.

Thank you all three!   :-)  I also hadn't thought about the 
viewing-access security thing but that would be very handy in this 
situation too, and should the teachers ever decide they want individual 
blogs it'll be nice to have that as an option for them.  MU is installed 
now, and if life treats me well, hopefully we'll have it set up just-so 
by January so I can show it off then.

James, can you clarify this though just in case I'm taking this in the 
wrong direction?

 > However, if you are going to try and make several department sites on

I would like to pull at least category information from the different 
blogs into a menu, and possibly grab info from different blogs for the 
front page. Would that cause a problem?

-Velda

P.S. - does anyone care whether we top or bottom post?  I'm flexible..

Note that it can get a little complicated if you are using completely
differint urls for each and every site. (sitea.com siteb.com sitec.com
etc...)  However if you are running things out of the same domains like
http://****.hardknocks.edu or http://www.hardknocks.edu/**** then WPMU is a
very good option for you.

There are several basic terms that become confusing when talking about mu.
It seems like this list might have a lot of mu discussion.  So, I'm going to
through this out there.

The first is "Site"
A site for WPmu is a network of blogs that are connected at some level by a
single domain and are managed together as a group.  You can have a virtually
unlimited number of sites (blog networks) each with a virtually unlimited
number of blogs. Across each site you can control themes that are available
to each of the blogs.  You can also have plugins that are automatically
active on all of your sites. In most mu installs, there is only one site
used and you may not ever need to use this term. Individual blogs are
reached from http://blogname.sitedomain.com/ or
http://sitedomain.com/blogname/. That is, through sub-domains or
sub-directories.

The second is "Blog"
Just as with any other standard WordPress blog, this is an individual blog
with its own content, settings and users.  In WPmu every blog is a member of
a site. A user one one blog can have a different or identical role on
another blog.  So Matt might admin one blog and subscribe to an another OR
be an admin for the main site and be able to administrate the settings for
each of the blogs on the network.

The third term is "Domain"
Each site has a Domain.  Blogs have urls that are variants on that domain.
It is possible to have the blogs have a domain that is differs from the
domain of the site. However that involves the use of a recently developed
plugin (last month) and there are some difficulties involved in making the
source code match the primary domain and in maintaining the changes if you
enter certain areas of the site admin.

We're setting up a similar service at McGill University using WPMU, I'd
be interested in hearing what plugins you're using, especially for the
privacy level aspect.

So far we're using the WPDirAuth plugin to handle user authentication
via Active Directory and we're investigating a way to use AD groups as a
user access level mechanism. We'll also be providing podcast
capabilities, feeding to iTunesU (I'm hoping someone updates podpress!).

The full list of plugins is at
http://ucalgaryblogs.ca/wp-content/plugins/

None of them are active by default, but they're available to users of  
the service.

The mu-plugins, which are enabled automatically are at
http://ucalgaryblogs.ca/wp-content/mu-plugins/

That's probably a raging security hole leaving those directories  
visible... Maybe I should block that...

The blog privacy levels are added by More Privacy Options at
http://wpmudev.org/project/More-Privacy-Options

I decided to avoid integrating with the campus LDAP authentication  
because I wanted it to be clear that this was a non-institutional  
service - it's for the community, but the blogs belong to the students  
and faculty. For now, they have to create separate accounts, which  
hasn't been a problem (since the all have Facebook/MySpace/Google/ 
Twitter/etc... accounts already)

Message-ID: <c41cda880811051601m200f9a65u888130c2749b37fc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was reading other threads in this list about your projects, so I
have some questions for all people that want to use WP for educational
purposes. Just for curiosity and share our experiences.
I'm currently involved in an educational project with the University
of Naples "Federico II" in Italy. We currently use WP to support the
educational activities in 52 courses - basically with lessons posted
on the site, enriched with images, videos, links, podcasts, downadable
documents (pdf, zip, ppt etc...).
In the first release (september 2007) we choose to not allow the
students to post comments and interact with teachers (comments are
closed). But the next release, (probably in the first week of next
month) will have more than 100 new courses and for each course we'll
give a little community, where registered students can comment the
lessons, do surveys on course topics, stay tuned with classroom news
and post links to web resources (papers, videos, web sites etc...)

My questions for you are:

What are the WordPress features that you think be useful for your projects?
You want to build a community of teachers and students, give a blog to
every student, let students post articles?
What type of interaction do you think is the best for a good
educational project?
At the moment WP - a simple installation of WP - allows only comments.
It's ok for you or you need more?
For your needs is better WordPress Mu? Or you need custom features?
Do you have already considered to use other platforms (Joomla, Drupal,
Moodle...) and why do you think that WP is more suitable for you?

Thanks in advance,
(and sorry for my awful english)

I've set up MU but can't seem to figure out how to make the individual 
blogs go to a subdirectory rather than to a subdomain... any tips?

Velda,

You'll probably get better answers to that question here:

http://mu.wordpress.org/docs/
or here: http://mu.wordpress.org/forums/

This list is more about using WordPress (MU or not) for education and
how to get the most out of it.

Hi everyone,

Thanks for starting this list off so well and contributing with
questions, ideas, and links. We're heading in a good direction!

With that in mind, I'd like to create some sort of centralized blog
where I can post and add to some of the good ideas and suggestions
that come from this list. It'll give people interested in WordPress
and education a simple way to glance through the product of our
discussions and get the information and resources they need to use
WordPress for their educational institution.

I just created wpedu.wordpress.com (haven't done anything with it yet)
and am sending a note to the owner of education.wordpress.com to see
if he would be willing to part with his subdomain. I'd love to hear
your thoughts on what we should include on this blog and how we can
use it.

Again, welcome to the list and thanks for sharing!

Hello all.  This list could not have come at a better time.  I was recently
awarded a project for a local elementary school district.  There are five
schools in all.  The initial focus of the revised site will be a new website
for the district and the board of education, then a new site for each
school.  After that initial work is done, we'll be creating individual
classroom sites, something like 100 classroom sites/pages.  The teachers
currently use Apple iWeb to create their sites and upload them with FTP.
There is a link on the individual school page to their personalized space.
I am not sure if we'll be retaining that, or converting them all over to
WordPress.  If we convert to WordPress, we'd need a way to allow them some
freedom with the design, as they have now with iWeb.

I'm looking forward to learning more from other's experiences, especially
with WPMU.  I've done 30 or 40 websites so far with WordPress, but none with
MU, and I'm not sure if it makes sense to start with MU here, planning for
the inevitibility of all the classroom sites going to WordPress.  I maintain
my WordPress installations with subversion now, and it's not too bad, but
doing the same thing with 100+ sites might be a bit of a challenge.  One
code base definitely sounds better to me.

Thanks,
Chris Hajer

Claudio,

Welcome!

Here are my thoughts in response to your questions.

> What are the WordPress features that you think be useful for your projects?

Obviously, posting and commenting are the things that really make
WordPress what it is and they help in education too. Flexible themes
and user options and the wide array of plugins available for WordPress
create essentially unlimited opportunities. There are a lot of ways to
organize content using tags and categories, which can be really useful
as well.

> You want to build a community of teachers and students, give a blog to
> every student, let students post articles?

I think it depends on the intention of the class and of the
implementation of blogging. Do you want to provide students with a
medium to showcase some of their writing or do you want to expose them
to blogging in full force? If you want to do the later, students and
teachers getting their own blog is most appropriate. If you want to do
the former, then one blog could probably serve the needs of the
project. I think it boils down to this: do you want the blog/project
to have one voice or many?

> What type of interaction do you think is the best for a good
> educational project?

Comments are great. WordPress is improving commenting and it is
definitely on the agenda. Contact forms obviously offer a more
traditional form of communication and interaction. And of course,
students and teachers can respond to other students and teachers via
blog posts if the blog or project is setup that way. Commenting in the
way of linking to another post and adding your own thoughts is a great
way to take advantage of blogging for education.

> At the moment WP - a simple installation of WP - allows only comments.
> It's ok for you or you need more?

You do a lot more than just comment with a simple WordPress
installation. I talked about some of the features in your first
question and I think one of the most prominent features is the ability
to easily install plugins. There are so many plugins available and
with them, you can do so much that it is unbelievable.

> For your needs is better WordPress Mu? Or you need custom features?

We just had another discussion about WordPress MU versus a regular
installation of WordPress. Here is a link to our archives:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-edu/2008-November/thread.html

> Do you have already considered to use other platforms (Joomla, Drupal,
> Moodle...) and why do you think that WP is more suitable for you?

I personally haven't used any other content management systems or blog
software since I started using WordPress.

Hopefully this is helpful! Again, welcome to the wp-edu list.

Hello all,

A couple years ago, when WPMU was in v1.0 or thereabouts, I had
tried to implement within a department, with the hope of extending
it to the entire University later. However, there were some concerns:

 1. Letting every student have a blog and write whatever they
    feel like.

    This was the primary concern and since there was no simple
    & effective way of screening what the students would post,
    we decided to give the power of writing to teaching 
    assitantships and faculty only.

 2. Authentication mechanism

    My school, Michigan Tech University, had developed some
    in house Apache modules to certify a University-wide
    application. Although we used LDAP to authenticate users,
    the process of incorporating the procedure into WPMU was
    not trivial.

    I see that there is a plugin that someone mentioned 
    in this list but I still haven't been able to make it
    work :(

These and some other security related concerns made our IT
department use Jive Software products instead of WPMU.

Though I am out of the University now, I would personally be
very interested in learning about using Active Directory
(LDAP) to authenticate a community of users and automagically
create their blogs within WPMU.

Best,
gowtham

Chris,

Welcome! Thanks for introducing yourself. I think you'll find this
list to be helpful. It sounds like you have quite a project ahead of
you, but it also sounds like WordPress and WordPress MU are well
suited to what you need to do.

Hi All,

A few of us have been organizing WordCamps relating to education.. the
first one is going to be just outside Washington DC on November 22nd,
(http://dc2008.wordcamped.org/).  Randall Rode is organizing a second
WordCamp Ed  that'll be held as part of the Northeast Regional
Computing Program (NERCOMP) on February 2nd
(http://www.nercomp.org/events/upcoming_events.aspx).  I stumbled upon
some chatter in the UK about a WordCamp Ed event there as well, but
I'm not sure where those conversations left off.

Let me know if you're interested in starting one -- we share a twitter
account, webspace, graphics/etc.  It shouldn't be too hard to get
going, and there's a lot more info on the official WordCamp website.

Best,
Dave Lester

How many Edu-WordPress-folk are going to be attending Northern Voice  
in Vancouver this February? There might be a good chance for an

Chris,

Give the structure of the design you are talking about, I would
strongly consider WPMu, particularly because you can manage all the
different school blogs, teacher blogs for the five schools, all in one
database, and upgrade plugins, themes, and the install in self in one
fell swoop.  if you are familiar with developing in a single install
of WP, WpMu will not be a stretch for you at all.  I highly recommend
it, and if you need to have the themes, I recommend DSader's
userthemes which you can get over at wpmudev.org, which allows you to
edit themes for each WPMu blog--very useful for integrating several
different blogs into one synamic/visual whole.

Best,
Jim

Hey! We do have laundry up here!

Sounds like we might have a few wp-edu-folk up for the show. I'm  
willing to organize a WordCamp Education event, but need to get a  
guesstimate of how many people might be interested. I put a PollDaddy  
poll on my blog to help get a feel for the numbers.

http://www.darcynorman.net/2008/11/05/wordcamp-education-northern-voice-2009/

Northern Voice is held in Vancouver in February - the exact dates  
haven't been nailed down yet, but it's typically been a Friday 
+Saturday event, so there's room to add a day before or after the  
conference proper. Last year, there were a couple of Automattic folks  
(Matt and Lloyd) so hopefully we can convince them to come play with  
us again :-)

If anyone would like someone from Automattic to come speak at an
event, definitely ask. If you want to pass the request onto me, I can
check and see who is available and what we can do. There is no harm in
asking. Worst case is we say is that we can't make it work. Best case
is someone (or multiple people) from Automattic attend and speak. :)

Can anyone point to any advocacy resources online that support using
WordPress in education?  I have run across multiple organizations, in
government and education specifically, who feel that if it's free (as
in beer) there must be something wrong with it.  If they're not paying
a huge up front cost and a big license fee every year, there must be
something wrong.  It's unnatural for them NOT pay for these things
(and equally unnatural to me to pay for them).  Many companies exist
to sell solutions to municipalities and school districts, but who is
going to make the case for Open Source solutions like WordPress? As a
taxpayer, I think it's irresponsible for my school district or local
government to pay for a CMS when there are so many good free ones out
there (well, the only one I can really recommend is WordPress, and
yes, I refer to it as a CMS.)

So, what experiences have you had *selling* WordPress for use in education?

Thanks,
Chris Hajer

Actually I didn't find the answer it in either place -- I'd looked for 
information on that setting before I posted, as common sense and common 
courtesy would dictate.   I didn't find an answer (maybe didn't get the 
right search terms, and the readme didn't mention it), so I thought 
someone here might know given how well mu applies to edu. setups.

As sheepish I'm feeling to have wandered so far off topic that Douglas 
here had to set me straight, I'm more embarrassed now on figuring out 
the answer. I'll still share it anyway though in case anyone else is as 
silly a newbie to MU (for Edu) as I am.  If someone stumbles across the 
archive with the same issue:   I'd apparently breezed right past the 
radio button on setup that lets one choose to use subdirectories instead 
of subdomains.  Reinstalling -- and paying more attention this time 
around -- solved my problem. I'd imagine there's a switch hiding 
somewhere in the db or a config file that would have done the trick 
nicely too.

My quick intro:  my day job is web hosting; I also blog a little, and I 
do volunteer work at my kids' charter school.  I have been trying to get 
the school to migrate to wordpress because of WP's back-end simplicity 
(something the over-worked teachers need) and strong sense of 
community.  The tech team there has just recently agreed to give me the 
go-ahead.   So I'm trying to make that work now, and after several 
scrapped attempts, was quite happy to find this list.  Hopefully I can 
pull it off, and in the process maybe learn enough that I'll be able to 
give back a little.  :-)

Chris,

It's kind of what I do for a living :)

Actually, I work at the University of Mary Washington as an
instructional technologist, and we have been experimenting with
WordPress as both a blogging solution,a s well as a loose CMS,
eportfolio system, quick and easy professional sites, domain mapped
omnibus, etc. In short, we have been all over this application, we
finally went to a wpmu install almost two years ago after the demand
was too big and the upgrades and plugin management were too unwieldy
(you can see it here: http://umwblogs.org).

I think the point that WordPress is free isn't exactly true, all
software (whether open source or proprietary) somes a t a cost. And
while the application is free, time, energy and development goes into
actually creating something worthwhile and dynamic--just so happens is
that WP is one of the most flexible options because it is open and the
community is so strong (without that it would be just another blogging
app).  I get paid to help faculty and students re-imagine publishing
for their academic pursuits, and WordPress fits the needs of our
community nicely, many professors and students are familiar with it,
and the tech stuff is easy enough that a technical half-wit like
myself can make it work fairly well.

All this to say, the advocacy for WordPress comes from the people who
are using it. And arguments against free software being necessarily
problematic because ti is free, is as flawed as arguing it is
necessarily better than one you might pay for. I find I sold people on
it with examples from what others are doing, find and talk with people
who are using it at their organizations or schools, and ask them why
they use it, how they have adopted it, and what the user experience is
like.  Also, who maintains it, and what is the real cost behind
managing it.  Do they have people who help folks with it?  How much
does training cost?  Do they have PHP developers on staff? Etc.
WordPress is good, and I agree it can make one hell of a CMS, but it
does require some hacking and minimal PHP knowledge to make it work,
that said the educational community in WordPress is getting
increasingly stronger.

I've spent a good three years blogging about educational uses of
Wordpress (http://bavatuesdays.com/tag/wpmued), and I am relatively
late to the game. James Farmer has been doing it for far longer than
that, as have D'Arcy norman and many other. So, here are some examples
if you want to argue the ridiculous point that just because it is
cheaper and more flexible it has to be faulty check out the Ten ways
to use UMW Blogs:
http://umwblogs.org/support/ten-ways-to-use-umw-blogs/

Check out  D'Arcy Norman's UCalgary Blogs (ucalgaryblogs.org), or
EDUBLOGS (edublogs.org) which is a full-fledged business running
nearly 200,000 blogs on this "free" software.  It is solid, and it's
openness has afforded it an insane community that ensures it's
predominance, you can;t pay people to be passionate about something,
it just happens, and what follows is often both exciting and valuable.
ther eare many, many more examples, and I'm sure others on this list
will pile them on readily.

Good luck selling,
Jim

One example of free-software advocacy and selling of services around  
the application of the software is FunnyMonkey.com - they happen to be  
using Drupal as a CMS, and Moodle, but the concepts map across pretty  
nicely.

The software itself matters SO much less than the philosophy of  
openness. Once freedom is embraced, it matters surprisingly little  
which exact software is adopted.

Another company that is doing pretty well (including in the education  
field) is RainCityStudios.com - a Drupal shop out of Vancouver. Again,  
the concepts would map across to WordPress and WPMU very easily - set  
up infrastructure, sell services, support and consulting around the  
software, and build a community of people and companies who work with  
you. Great stuff.

Velda,

No problem! I'm glad you got your issue resolved. Sometimes the most
obvious solution is the one we don't think would make a difference.

You're in the right place if you are looking to learn and then give
back what you've learned. :) I'm looking forward to seeing your
continued contributions.

I think another example is Automattic itself. We offer a free service
using free software and make money through optional upgrades, special
hosting arrangements with our VIPs, and service contracts. We've built
a large business with real live employees around the model and it has
been very successful.

People that are "unaware" attach a negative stigma to free software.
There are free solutions out there that are just as good, and in many
cases, better, than any paid solution. There are lots of people and
companies making their livings using and/or supporting WordPress -- it
is definitely a mainstream product with a lot of mainstream users (as
demonstrated in our showcase).

What can we do to help convince these schools that WordPress is a
viable solution, even though it is free and open source?

Great discussion.

James,

I understand completely the point you're making.  There is a cost to
getting anything up and running and keeping it there, proprietary,
closed, open, whatever (operating systems, CMS, desktop apps, etc.)
But the fact remains that WordPress IS free to start with, freely
available, and there is no ongoing licensing fee.  That's a huge
departure from what a lot of municipalities and schools are used to.
It is normal for a consultant to come in with a proposal, and right
off the top is software licensing..  It's expected, it's normal, it's
what the administrators are used to dealing with.  None of that makes
it right, but it is one of the things you come up against, oddly
enough.

The other philosophical change for schools is changing from a desktop
app publishing mentality to a web-based, modern CMS publishing
mentality.  I mentioned previously iWeb from Apple, and I have seen
Dreamweaver, HomeSite, Microsoft Front Page and Publisher and probably
others, all in use on the desktop.  That's another hurdle.  Once the
foot is in the door with a modern CMS like WordPress, we need to
change behaviour again.

I think it's great that we are even having this discussion in the first place.

Cheers,
Chris Hajer

There is a great metaphor for the phenomenon of the cost of open source projects. While you often hear the "Free as in beer" vs. "Free as in speech" discussion, perhaps the best way to describe the way an educational institution employing a CMS like Wordpress is "Free as in Puppy". In other words, free to get, but a lot of time, energy and resources to keep going. I find it a good, quick way of describing it to people, since it seems to strike a chord. 

Hope that's helpful,
Brian Moynihan

The best part about this, I think, is that you can use the money you're saving from licensing to put back into development and getting exactly what you want. Whether that's increased training/classes/books/conferences for your permanent staff or hiring an outside developer/usability specialist, you have resources to get it done.

Joel, this is an excellent point. Licensing for enterprise level
software is expensive and the money you save allows you to have a lot
of flexibility when it comes to doing additional training or hiring
someone to help out.

Subject: [wp-edu] Introduction
Message-ID: <C539B353.F0E%jwinn@post01.lincoln.ac.uk>

Hello,

Just an introduction... I set up WPMU at the university where I work in May
and have been slowly accumulating users through word-of-mouth.

http://learninglab.lincoln.ac.uk/blogs/

I've just started the first round of formal advocacy to Snr. Management,
trying to get it accepted on a wider, institutional level and the response
so far has been supportive but understandably cautious. I am optimistic
though. 

Ideally, I'd like to set up http://community.lincoln.ac.uk (dead link) and
have BuddyPress layered over the blogs. I think that would appeal to a wider
audience and also allow us to brand the BuddyPress Social Networking layer
while still offering completely customisable blogs to individual users. I'm
less optimistic about this being accepted, but we'll see. Everyone here
recognises the potential of using WordPress for staff profile web sites,
collaborative web publishing, marketing, teaching and learning.

What complicates it slightly for us is that historically the ITC dept. are
very much a Microsoft shop and it's questionable whether we can
realistically support a large (potentially. 10,000 blog) installation of
WPMU. My plan is to look for reliable pool of freelance support. Our current
installation is on a Linux server which I run and as long as I don't hassle
anyone too often, I am king of that domain. There are obviously pros and
cons to this approach.

Also, we've only just switched to Blackboard for our VLE and some people are
concerned that WPMU would distract from the roll out of the new VLE and
confuse people about the appropriate use of each system.

Anyway, that's my short story. I'm interested in hearing about any other
stories relating to advocacy and roll out of WordPress in education.

Cheers
Joss

I'm not sure if, when you say 'we', you're referring to Automattic or to the
community as a whole.

It would be useful to me if there was a UK-based business that provides
commercial support, with an SLA and references to back them up. It's easier
to 'sell' a product when it's clear that other people are basing their
livelihoods on supporting it and have an established history of doing so.

If you know of any such businesses, please let me know!

The recent WordPress showcase site <http://wordpress.org/showcase/>, is a
very useful resource for demonstrating the versatility of the product.

Thanks for this.

Dear all,

I thought that it would be helpful to give my example of using WordPress for
education to run the IT Departments website at Ribblesdale School.  The site
can be viewd here:

http://www.ribbweb.org/ict/

Here WordPress is being used as CMS and as a blog in order to provide
content for classes of pupils aged between 11 - 16.  I have used a number of
plugins to enable to extra capability especially with the parent and child
pages and the polls that are on the site.  Being a teacher I have lots of
ideas how WordPress can be used in Education and I will be writing a blog
post on it shortly on my blog www.penny4them.com.

Thanks,

John,

I'd be interested to know what you think one would be doing with a blog that would require that level of recording keeping and auditing.  At my University we have WPMU running a few dozen blogs with various levels of activity but typically it's teams such as mine - Web Services who manage our websites - blogging about the work they're doing, what they're looking at and basically using it to improve communication with other interested people.

I can understand that using blogs for teaching and learning would add extra requirements for ensuring that student work was properly archived but merely having a few blogs isn't that dangerous.

Or maybe I'm crazy brave?!

Mike

Most uses of WordPress don't require that level of record keeping.
However everything published on a WordPress blog is available through
RSS feeds, and any document management software that doesn't accept RSS
feeds would be severely lacking.

If and when any of our WordPress blogs require formal archiving in our
document management software we'll just do it using RSS.

It would also be trivial to "freeze dry" a wordpress site using  
something like httrack for archival purposes.

John,

You must run a very tight ship at Edith Cowan University if all web
publishing relating to research, teaching, learning, marketing and
internal communications is performed through an institutionally
controlled CMS.  In my experience, there are usually a number of
disparate systems which may or may not work together; much like
academics, some of who choose to use the tools provided and many, who
do their own thing.

There are a number of ways that WordPress records information for
audit: highly queriable MySQL data, LDAP integration (if used), RSS &
Atom feeds for all content, and XML dumps that can be performed by
users at any time. In addition, each time the 'save' or 'publish'
button is hit, a new time-stamped revision is recorded against a user
profile. Backed up nightly, the data is available for audit at any
time. A simple 'wget -r' command will download a WordPress website in
its entirety for archiving in an Institutional Repository.

The UK Government seem happy to use it, too. For example:

http://www.number10.gov.uk/ (The Prime Minister's official website)
http://blogs.dfid.gov.uk/ (Department for International Development)
http://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/ (The Wales Office - official
representation for Wales in UK central government)
http://www.ournhs.nhs.uk/ (National Health Service reform)
http://governance.justice.gov.uk/ (Ministry of Justice)

I meant to add this, but forgot... At the University of Calgary, we're  
using Drupal as the official CMS for websites on campus. That means  
that IT provides sites and supports for faculty wanting to create  
sites for use in their classes. I've extended this by offering a WPMU  
server for more individual control. It's working out REALLY well, and  
the adoption of both applications is quite remarkable.

Message-ID: <F081EA5E-D705-4E0C-A290-8F7E3A19BD05@willnorris.com>

First a quick introduction:  My name is Will Norris.  Until recently,  
I worked at University of Southern California on enterprise identity  
management.  During that time I was a member of the core development  
team for Shibboleth[0], a web single sign-on package popular in higher  
education.  I now focus primarily on OpenID[1] and maintain the  
WordPress OpenID plugin[2] and a new Shibboleth plugin[3].

At USC, we were well on the way to making it institutional policy that  
any enterprise applications MUST integrate with the university's  
identity management infrastructure.  Depending on the application,  
this typically meant Shibboleth or LDAP.  The level of integration  
varied -- the bare minimum was authentication and authorization to use  
the application (the two are inseparable at USC).  Beyond that  
applications could use the IdM infrastructure for additional user  
attributes, more fine-grained authorization within the application,  
and management of user groups.

I'm particularly interested to hear what integration challenges  
universities have faced with WordPress.  Does your university require  
this integration and to what degree?  What interfaces does your IdM  
system provide -- LDAP, Active Directory, web single sign-on  
(Shibboleth, PubCookie, CAS, CoSign, other)?  How much success have  
you had with this integration?  Did you use publicly available  
plugins, or a home-grown solution?

Thanks,
Will Norris

John,

Michael communicated what my thought was: most blogs aren't setup with
the intention of serving as a complex record keeping program. They are
excellent for publishing information that needs to be published (and
thus wouldn't be sensitive information) and for communicating and
collaborating, but in general, they aren't setup for record management
and keeping.

As far as privacy goes, there are a number of plugins and settings
that can be implemented for additional privacy. At WordPress.com, we
allow users to restrict their blog to only certain users or to just
prevent search engines from viewing it (keeping the traffic more
targeted at the people who know the blog is there). Private blogs
don't work with RSS and the several of plugins available for
self-hosted installations have configurable RSS settings.

With regular backups and the versioning system built into WordPress,
your data is certainly safe if it is cared for and kept track of.
Backups are always a good idea and having a backup system and a
process for regular updates in place would probably almost certianly
in a very safe and a very reliable WordPress installation.

Hopefully that answers your question and addresses some of your concern.

When I say we, I mean both the community as a whole and Automattic.
Anyway we can help, we'll try our best.

I would have to research a UK-based business that has an SLA and
references in a commercial sense. There are plenty of UK-based web
hosting companies, many of which have SLAs and plenty of references.
Rackspace, a top web hosting company based in San Antonio, has a large
presence in the UK and is known for their support and SLAs.

With that in mind, another list member sent this nice list of UK
government agencies using WordPress:

http://www.number10.gov.uk/ (The Prime Minister's official website)
http://blogs.dfid.gov.uk/ (Department for International Development)
http://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/ (The Wales Office - official
representation for Wales in UK central government)
http://www.ournhs.nhs.uk/ (National Health Service reform)
http://governance.justice.gov.uk/ (Ministry of Justice)

I would think a list like that would be helpful.

Identity management is definitely a challenge in academic  
environments, though WP's architecture eases the burden of  
integration. We use CAS for authn and a mishmash of authz solutions  
for the web apps at my school, where we have both WPMU and a few  
instances of the regular .org version integrated with it (I maintain  
the wpCAS[1] plugin for this purpose).

The real problem we face, however, is that our IdM strategy is now  
centered on our student information system. That might not be so bad  
if the SIS (or our business rules) were more flexible, but as we look  
to serve growing numbers of users who don't seem to have a proper  
place in the SIS, we find ourselves rethinking the problem.

The apparent support within the WP community for OpenID and OAtuh, as  
well as the solid plugin API and development of BuddyPress has us  
considering putting WP at the center of our IdM strategy.

We use LDAP (AD) to control access to all systems. This includes:

WordPress MU using WPDirAuth plugin.
Custom web publishing system.
SunGard HE products.
Exchange server.
Oracle portal.
Documentum CMS.

Lots of proprietary stuff in there, but I don't sign the cheques.

The WPDirAuth plugin was written in-house but it's publicly available.
The last I heard Automattic were taking over development of it but I
never got confirmation from Automattic on that.

Douglas,

Having LDAP support in WordPress core would, of course, go a long way
in reassuring IT managers that the application is 'enterprise ready'.

Definitely. LDAP support isn't something I have heard brought up in
the past, but it is always possible to do.

Here is a post about single signon from one of our systems
administrators that may be helpful:

I'm checking on the WPDirAuth plugin and will report what I find out.

We implemented AD authentication on our WPMu install.  It was actually quite
easy using the DirAuth plugin.

Hi Mark,

I had to talk to a few people, but I did get a definitive answer on
Automattic's involvement with the WPDirAuth plugin. We see the value
in it and we're committed to keeping it working with WordPress as we
release upgrades and changes. With that in mind, we aren't actively
developing any new features for it. Our ideal involvement is reviewing
and accepting patches from the community and committing them to the
plugin's code as a point-of-contact instead of an active developer.

Did you have any ideas for features? We can look into the possibility
of making them happen, but obviously can't promise anything. LDAP is
not something we use internally, but we do understand that it is
important to the educational community and many of our enterprise
users.

If anyone here is technical and is interested in maintaining the
plugin more actively, please let me know and I will put you in touch
with the right people.

Thanks for the question, Mark. Hopefully this answer is helpful.

I have a version that I updated for 2.6, including admin interface
styling, although it'll probably now need a tweak for 2.7. If you want I
can submit a patch for either/both versions. Just let me know where/how.

That's more or less what I expected, although it would be nice if
Automattic at least checked the code for sensibleness.

The feature I will probably have to investigate at some point is the
incorporation of Active Directory groups into WordPress security,
allowing roles/access to be defined based on those groups.

I guess that would be me, as I've already worked on it and I know the
original author. LDAP isn't my favourite thing in the world, but it's
something I have to work with.

Is the DirAuth plugin compatible with WPMU? I see there's also this for
WPMU: http://sourceforge.net/projects/wpmu-ldap/

I'd be interested to know what people are using with WPMU for LDAP
integration.

Yes, we are using it with WPMU.

That looks like an interesting alternative, I wonder why it's for wpmu
only.

We are using the WPMU LDAP plugin at sourceforge - works great.  I didn't know about the DirAuth plugin until this discussion!

Hi everyone,

Thanks for coming up with such great discussions and contributing so
much to this list. As part of my role helping with WordPress for
Education, I'm creating an "Implementation Guide" that we will make
available to educators and administrators. The idea is to have a nice
downloadable/printable PDF that will explain WordPress, why it's good
for education, and how to make it happen.

Here is the tentative (and still incomplete outline) for what we're
going to include:

Welcome to WordPress for Education
Table of Contents
What is WordPress?
Who uses WordPress?
Cost
WordPress for Education Overview
How WordPress Can Be Used at Your School
WordPress on the Campus
WordPress in the Classroom
Getting Stated With WordPress
Where to Get Additional Information

I'd really love to hear your ideas and suggestions. You are the people
who have tried to convince administrators (hopefully successfully!)
that WordPress is the way to go and is a great option and then tried
to make it all happen. What would have been helpful to you initially?

(Keep in mind your suggestions don't have to fit within the confines
on this document. We're also going to have a web site at
edu.wordpress.com (under construction) that will have additional
information.)

Thanks so much.

Douglas,

Not to be a stick in the mud, but this conversation has been going on
throughout the education/edtech blogosphere for a while. And WordPress
is usually just a touchstone. Is this list intended to be a space for
warehousing that information and the re-packaging it to push WordPress
as a product rather than a process for thinking through the
implications of the new state of publishing for education?

I mean wordpres is great and all, and many have used it to some great
advantage, but it seems like you are suggesting we participate in the
creation of an Automattic brochure devoid of the personal relations
that foster the community that has made WordPress what it is. All of
which kind of seems strange to me. The conversation is in progress,
why not follow and join it where it is happening if you are th
education evangelist for WordPress. That seem more relevant that
creating a pdf for a mass mailer?

I don't know, just seems that once we formalize the discussion around
WordPress as product too much, the joy of thinking through
possibilities kind of evaporates.

Best,
Jim

Hi Jim,

Thanks for your email and you do have a valid point.

This list serves as a place to discuss WordPress in education. On a
broader level, it is a place to discuss how technology (specfically
blogging) can be used in education.

This list definitely isn't here to push Automattic or WordPress down
anyone's throat by any means. Of course, we want to promote WordPress
in education and make it viable for education, but we want to do that
within the scope of the community. With this list, we're hoping that
people can share ideas, best practices, etc. and just get a
conversation going around blogging and education. I think the rest of
the "magic" happens from there.

The idea behind the document I suggested is not to replace anything
we're doing or the community is doing, but instead to help it. From my
experience in education and from what I have heard, educators
(particularly administrators) are often hesitant to implement
WordPress in the classroom or on their campus for any number of
reasons. Them knowing more about WordPress, who uses it, how it's
used, etc. is a good way to help reduce or eliminate that hesitation.
Having a document that any campus or school advocate can easily show
or send to that person in doubt can be helpful and at the very least,
saves the "convincer" time and energy.

Personally, I think anything that brings more educators, campuses, and
classrooms into the blogosphere and onto WordPress benefits the
WordPress for education community. It is more ideas that can be
shared, more people to help develop plugins and create best practices,
more students that can learn about and benefit from blogging, etc.

This proposed document is certainly not formalizing WordPress as a
product or limiting what we can or should discuss here. If anything,
it is providing us with a jumping off point for further discussion.

Let me know if you still have any doubts or concerns. I'd be more than
happy to explain or address them.

kneejerk---the days are shorter now, and food is scarce.

At my institution we're using a heavily modified version of the DirAuth plugin.

It's been modified so much that on my to-do list is a rewrite of the
plugin to make it easier to maintain in our environment and take into
account our requirements.

Part of the rewrite will be integration with our course management system.

I buy the idea of making this information available to help arguments  
for using WP in educational settings- in part because I've had to make  
these arguments.  (Although I wonder a little if it strips those who  
are using pre-packaged arguments of a needed chance to research and  
really internalize why they want to do this and what it would take.)   
It does help to have the outside "expert" as a voice on your side and  
some people would be able to explain the educational side but would be  
unable to make the server architecture argument.

I think the idea of creating a pdf is a mistake in and off itself (at  
least as a main vehicle).  PDFs kind of embody the opposite of what  
WPMU is good at, being that they're (mostly) fixed and don't leverage  
RSS or community very well (at all? I'm not sure since I didn't go to  
the NMC Adobe- Collaboration in the Cloud thing).

If I was trying to prove how useful WPMU is in education I'd use WPMU  
as the vehicle.  It'd be a lot like what Jim has done with with WMU  
blogs in certain aspects, in that your site would become an  
aggregation area for both examples of and instruction on how and why  
you'd use WPMU in an educational setting.

I'd probably have an "all-stars" page where I highlighted whole WPMU  
sites or particularly effective node blogs but I'd want a constant  
stream of new content flowing through as well.  There's some risk  
there.  You aren't fully in control of what might come in via the  
feeds but I think that's a good thing.

Maybe you make a few one page PDFs every so often that encapsulate key  
chunks of knowledge or common argument rebuttals but they should not  
stick around for years- maybe you could have one of the wiki plugins  
used and then auto-generate a pdf off a certain page every so often  
(could be a downside to that with regard to formatting but it'd  
probably equal out in terms of participation and quality of  
information).

I can see value in this and I can see what Jim is worried about.  You  
don't want to become the company with a slick sales pitch.  Let the  
community speak for you and provide you with examples and you'll have  
something authentic and powerful- start making big PDF ad pitches and  
I think you'll lose credibility.  Besides if you are pitching to the  
higher ups the PDF would probably consist of two sections- cost and  
security.

Doing this would give you the chance to help improve the community in  
some interesting ways and provide a center for an ongoing conversation  
that will continue to grow and impact many more people than a PDF ever  
would.  Make it a conversation not a sales pitch.  It is a lot of work  
to do it this way but it's also a different kind of work and work  
that'll produce more benefits for a much broader range of people.

I'd like to comment that in HigherEd there's a pretty good core group of developers/web professionals that use and/or push WordPress. I met three or four at HighEdWeb08 this past October. There are some great news sites at Colleges/Universities that are built on WordPress.

Hi everyone,

Thanks for coming up with such great discussions and contributing so
much to this list. As part of my role helping with WordPress for
Education, I'm creating an "Implementation Guide" that we will make
available to educators and administrators. The idea is to have a nice
downloadable/printable PDF that will explain WordPress, why it's good
for education, and how to make it happen.

Here is the tentative (and still incomplete outline) for what we're
going to include:

Welcome to WordPress for Education
Table of Contents
What is WordPress?
Who uses WordPress?

WordPress for Education Overview
How WordPress Can Be Used at Your School
WordPress on the Campus
WordPress in the Classroom
Getting Stated With WordPress
Where to Get Additional Information

I'd really love to hear your ideas and suggestions. You are the people
who have tried to convince administrators (hopefully successfully!)
that WordPress is the way to go and is a great option and then tried
to make it all happen. What would have been helpful to you initially?

(Keep in mind your suggestions don't have to fit within the confines
on this document. We're also going to have a web site at
edu.wordpress.com (under construction) that will have additional
information.)

Thanks so much.

I agree with idea that a PDF brochure makes it seem more static than  
dynamic, but I do think there's a case to be made for something people  
could print out during the course of their research to show to the  
people with the rubber stamps who don't want to sift through web sites  
for information. I'd suggest putting a web site with a nice print  
stylesheet, so that individual pages could be printed (like the one- 
off idea) or a site overview could be printed to form a more detailed  
booklet. This way, updating the site would keep PDFs updated with the  
most current information. With a new version of WordPress ever 4  
months or so, anything we can do to keep information current will be  
helpful.

I thought it might be a good idea for everyone to show off what they're
doing with WordPress, so to get things started, here's what we've been
doing at McGill University:

The university newspaper, McGill Reporter, recently switched to
WordPress:

http://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/

The CIO has a fledgling WordPress blog:

http://fyi.mcgill.ca/

and our pilot WPMU project http://blogs.mcgill.ca/ already has six blogs
under it, including:

The Beta Blog (news from the programming group) http://blogs.mcgill.ca/beta/
McGill School of the Environment http://blogs.mcgill.ca/mse/
Public Relations at Career and Management Studies http://blogs.mcgill.ca/ccepr/

Mark,

Great idea. As this topic develops, I'll add some of the favorites to
the showcase at WordPress.org. We have an education category over
there, but it definitely has room for expansion.

Mark, those are some nice looking sites.

At Plymouth State University we're using WordPress to drive our  
library website and catalog, as well as a digital photo archive.

http://library.plymouth.edu/browse/
http://beyondbrownpaper.plymouth.edu/browse/

More information about the Scriblio plugins that power those sites here:

http://about.scriblio.net/

We also have a WPMU pilot project going with a few hundred blogs. Our  
CIO blogs there, and our former MIS director continues to use the blog  
he started while at Plymouth State:

http://dcfischer.blogs.plymouth.edu/
http://ken.blogs.plymouth.edu/

The WPMU pilot is basically complete and we're planning to  
dramatically expand the role of blogs. We're planning to implement  
BuddyPress as it stabilizes and then beginning a program to have every  
student, faculty, and staff member create and maintain their profile.

I recently blogged a list of 70 institutions of higher ed that are using or
experimenting with WPMU (
http://blog.davelester.org/2008/10/28/wordpress-multi-user-on-college-campuses/),
and I've received over 20 comments suggesting additional installs and
creative uses.  You may want to check that out, and I'd welcome others to
add their sites and continue building the resource.

While some Higher Ed WPMU installs have flashy front-ends, there's growing
interest among secondary educators using and experimenting with WordPress
MU.  We have a good contingent attending WordCamp Ed DC this weekend.  Due
to obvious privacy concerns given the age of their bloggers, they don't have
the same public audience or packaging that an institution like UMW has (to
my knowledge).  Nevertheless, they should probably be mentioned in the PDF,
and I'd be interested in who's doing what out there.

Hah, you just think it's a good idea because your sites are so very 
pimpable. Nice job there, Mark.  I'll post mine when it's actually got 
some CSS back in it ;-)

We?re currently using WPMU to host a number of individual blogs within the
university, based off of a similar theme we?re using on all of them. Users
have access to change anything within the blog they wish, save for the theme
template. A few good examples:

http://blogs.missouristate.edu/reslife/
http://blogs.missouristate.edu/cnas/
..and of course the blog for my office at
http://blogs.missouristate.edu/web/

(full list at http://blogs.missouristate.edu)

We?re also in the planning stages for a few other university sites what will
be using WPMU as a backend but more as a CMS, and less as a blog. I?m
custom-building all of these higher-level sites as needed. I?ll share these
once some of them start going live...

At Macaulay Honors College, we've been using Wordpress for a variety of class blogs for about 5 years--with good success.

This year we rolled out WPMU for our eportfolios for students--and they're seeing a lot of use just in the past couple of months.  My original thought was that these would be used by individual students just for eportfolio-type projects, but the variety of options has exploded and we're seeing personal blogs, class blogs, teaching blogs by our tech fellows, and I'm getting ready to start a meta blog--a portfolio of portfolios--myself.

Dave was kind enough to include us on his list (thanks, Dave!), but the more direct link than the one he has is here

Message-ID: <ac6164a00811191652p6e79c724w5189f1e9bb4bc556@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

I have been scanning those emails with lots of curiosity the past week
and yes, today is the day to participate in this vibrant discussion...

..a few things I would like to 'talk' about

*1 - the PDF* ..yes great idea. I agree that it sounds a bit static, old
fashion and not really 'open source', web 2.0...but hey...it is so useful!

I am a Dutch Architect, living in Africa at the moment.....being here I
realized how lucky we are in America/Europe to have a great and fast
connection. Here in Africa we never know if the next 5 minutes will be on or
off.....so imagine (using Tom's -great idea btw- example) of using WPMU with
all the info....and the text doesn't load, the pages don't work and the
internet is down....
.....to have a down loadable PDF would be great.

I have been teaching (art, leadership, photography, blogging) students in
the slums here the past months and experienced that information on the
projector is so much more interesting for them then another hand out...so I
would actually suggest that besides the PDF there be downloadable Powerpoint
presentations (al though the file size -we pay per used bit!- might become a
problem) with specific topics. This could, through slideshare be a little
less static then a link to a PDF.

Language that is being used in a guide is extremely important. Students are
often so bright about innovation and have their own way of explaining things
to their peers?I would suggest that for example the pieces for students are
made BY students

*2 ? Content guide *I would definitely want to see a piece on Wordpress and
mobile use in the guide! Mobile technology in Africa is the future! In
underprivileged communities?almost nobody has a personal computer?almost
everybody has a mobile phone!**

*3 ? Automattic and education*
regarding your mail, Jim and the speculations around Automattic and the
intention of opening up this list?.I can just say?thank you Automattic?I
would have never found that closed education list you are talking about Jim,
but I did find this one!

*4 ? Wordpress MU 4 humanity!*

I need some tips from this clever community! The students and I keep a blog:
http://lovetotheworld.org ?.

What's next? The underprivileged students are learning to blog, we now want
to start a WPMU at the domain that I own students4humanity.com or
blogs4humanity.com (at the moment there is nothing there yet!)  and make
this site a place where blogging students from Africa can meet blogging
students from all over the world, with the purpose of empowering youth by
youth, creating a sense of connectiveness, awareness, sharing of ideas and
creating actions around transformation in this world, with the end
goals?.the millennium goals?.eradication of poverty.

I am an architect (meaning?.an old fashion architect, the one that designs
buildings, not the modern 'information architect') ?.technology is one of my
passions? but hey I would need technical help (or time to do it myself) to
set this up in a powerful way.

*Let me start by asking?*

Would anybody be interested to be involved with this project? What tips do
you have? Would any of your students be interested to get involved? Does
anybody in this community have templates that I can use?

(also a note regarding funding?we need more computers, internet or mobile
phones to really make this happen here and in different parts in the
developing world?so if you have any ideas on this, let me know?)

let me know if you want more information about this project..

and for now?do tell your students to be inspired by the stories and
photographs of those underprivileged children here in Africa?and have them
leave some comments behind for the students!

Cheers!

*Frerieke*

Subject: [wp-edu] CommentPress
Message-ID: <49246CD3.B193.00C8.0@usouthal.edu>

Hello all--
I was wondering if anyone on the list is using CommentPress.  It is a wonderful theme for WordPress that lets you put comments "in the margin" at the paragraph level.  However, about a week ago, their site went down and it's broken the blog because an error message covers the entire wp-admin page saying it can't find the CommentPress version update site.  I was able to change the theme on all of my CommentPress sites to something that would work, but I'd really like to figure out how to fix it.
 
Has anyone had that experience?  And if so, do you have any ideas/suggestions on how to make it work again?
 
Thanks,
Rob Gray

I just edited out the section in /themes/commentpress/functions.php that
looks for theme updates. This gets rid of the dashboard error.

Everything between 

// MJE: The code below was changed because ...

and 

//* utility functions */


Can be commented out with // at the beginning of the line.

This theme looks interesting. I?d like to download it and test it but alas
their site is down. Does anyone have a .zip of the original theme they could
share with me? I think this would work well for one project I have coming
up. Thanks!

I have temporarily uploaded the zip file to my server, and I'll leave it
there until the original site is back up.  I haven't edited the
functions.php file in the zip file, however, so you'll want to do that
according to Joss's directions.  In the file you'll download, it is
lines 611-631 (although in my installed file, it is like line 1187ff (or
so).
 
You can download it from my server at

Joel,
I believe CommentPress is a great teaching and learning tool because it allows students to respond to course content and to each other (the paragraph-level comments also work as threads).  I use it in my classes by posting poems or passages from other literary works for them to comment on.  I also will put up written lecture material from time to time.  A good example of this can be found at http://usapetal.net/wpmu/eh216/2008/08/16/a-word-on-reading-poetry/.  
 
I have several other blogs that are in CommentPress as well:
 
http://usapetal.net/wpmu/petal 
http://usapetal.net/wordpress/ 
http://usapetal.net/wpmu/robpoems/ 
http://negativecapabilitypress.org/blog/ 
 
Also, a faculty colleague of mine, who teaches poetry writing, has her students post their poems to Comment Press for feedback.  She has also used it for Freshman Composition courses.

And for those of you using WordPress MU, you might also consider  
nominating yourself or others for the WPMU Awards:

http://wpmu.org/2008-wpmu-awards/

But do it quick. I just discovered them, and the deadline is Friday  
the 21st.

I'm not sure if APU is represented on this list, but I just added this
site to the Showcase and thought I'd share it here as well:
http://blogs.apu.edu/

I've seen the admissions offices at quite a few colleges and
universities embrace blogging. Oregon State's Admissions Office also
has its own blog: http://oregonstate.edu/admissions/blog/

You all should enter your mu sites into the WPMU awards
 
http://wpmu.org/2008-wpmu-awards/
 
Make sure you get them in by 11:59:59PM UTC0 today as they have to be in by
"Friday (21st)".  The guy running the site is in Austrailia and did his last
post for the week before heading home and gave the current tally, but I'm
sure he will allow any new entries to count as long as they are in by
midnight. That's 8ish hours from now in GMT.  I entered one yesterday and
three more will be entered shortly.  I thought I would share it with all you
folk first.
 
Cheers!

Has anyone noticed blogs in general getting blocked by district
firewalls (especially at the secondary level)?

I know that the firewall my local district (Palm Beach County, FL)
uses is pretty stringent and almost immediately blocks any
installation of WordPress or any other popular blogging software /
sites (i. e. Blogger). Has anyone noticed or heard about something
similar in their area or is this something that is fairly uncommon?

I talked to a number of teachers at WordCamp Ed whose schools block  
all social media sites as well as wordpress.com, blogspot, etc.

Yeah, it is insane, I think the idea that the rule for schools to
close this stuff out is in many ways their death knell of relevance. I
mentioned it recently at WordCampED, but Henry Jenkins "Why
Universities Shouldn't Create 'Something Like YouTube'"
http://www.henryjenkins.org/2008/10/why_universities_shouldnt_crea_1.html

And while the title of the article suggests otherwise, the most
significant parts for me was when he talks about how the pedominant
approach to technology which is characterized by fear is in effect
de-skilling students and futhering the gap between haves and have
nots:

"As long as they react to these developments as risks rather than
resources, then those kids who have access to this online world are
going to be de-skilled as they enter the schoolhouse gates and those
kids who don't have access are going to be left further behind because
they have been abandoned by the institutions which are otherwise best
situated to address the digital divide in terms of technical access
and the participation gap in terms of access to skills and
experiences. So, yes, informal learning is taking place outside of
school for those who are able to access it but the refusal of schools
to engage with it further amplifies the inequalities between
information haves and have nots."

Agreed. By blocking these sites rather than teaching students how to  
apply critical thinking skills in assessing their worth (or lack  
thereof) is a seriously missed opportunity at best, and a major  
failure of education at worst.

In K12, I can tell you that the fear in many cases is simply that  
students may "communicate" outside of the allowed methods.  That's the  
basic fear- communication, not bad information or anything else.  It's  
just a simple fear that students will communicate.

Our county blocked the word blog in URLs for quite a long time despite  
anything I could say.  We've loosened up a little (after years of  
arguments) but there are still blocks on all the major blogging sites,  
twitter, flickr etc. etc.

K12 (as a whole) fears and mistrusts its own students.  That's a  
fundamental issue that has to be addressed but seems to be completely  
ignored.

Many school districts, including the provincial learning network in  
British Columbia which hosts all school connections, subscribe to a  
blocking/filtering service called Websense. I have been told that  
there is a checkbox in their software that enables the "block social  
sites" option. It's as easy as that to block access. Websense is even  
smart enough to allow access to Flickr, but to filter for  
objectionable content.


The discussion as to whether or not to throw the switch has come up  
several times in BC - so far so good. Individual districts can request  
that certain sites be blocked or unblocked as well.

I just came across a related issue the other day - using my iphone an  
google reader, then clicking on the "see original" link in google  
reader results in the red screen of death. Websense thinks I am trying  
to bypass their proxy.

Cheers
