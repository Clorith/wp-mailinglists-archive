Subject: [wp-edu] Plugins to create an "Intranet"
Message-ID: <CY1PR0601MB19736E2CEFEE11E76E5EFC61AA050@CY1PR0601MB1973.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Greetings,


We have a website where we want to restrict access to on- and off-campus users (board of visitors members).


Normally we use Shibboleth for authenticating on-campus users.  However in this case we wanted something more simple to restrict access to pages, posts, and Media Library items.


Anyone have a favorite plugin they use for this purpose, and why did you choose this particular plugin?


Thanks in advance for any guidance you can provide.

This is the plugin we use when we need to restrict access to a site on our
multisite network:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/restricted-site-access/

This allows for a variety of options for restricting access.

Hope this helps,

Mike
