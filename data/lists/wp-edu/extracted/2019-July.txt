Hi all,

I’m wondering how you all maintain your user documentation and how to’s for your users. Wordpress.org’s support docs aren’t great and it’s tough to maintain our own with each upgrade.

Thoughts/ideas?

David

Hi David,

At UMaine, we built a website within our multisite network that focuses on
documentation specific to our theme's features. Over the last year we have
published a monthly newsletter to all admin user role accounts, with links
to content in the user guide where appropriate. These mini-articles are
also added as posts to the guide, which we can then use as reference when
supporting a user.

Anecdotally it's worked well to increase visibility of what our Digital
Communications team does and engagement with our department, we're now
working to provide better content styling guidance, as our content
management is very decentralized.

Kind regards,

Mike

Hi David.

We do something similar in our multisite. We actually have two support
sites - one containing WordPress 5 <https://wp5support.wp.unca.edu/>information
and an older one containing WordPress 4 <https://wp4support.wp.unca.edu/>
information (our users can choose which editor to use thanks to the Classic
Editor plugin). I've tried to keep the information in these support sites
very basic, so I don't have to constantly update. With all the tweaks going
on in WordPress 5.x right now though, it can be frustrating.

I created the WordPress 5 site from a copy of our WordPress 4 site, and
then revised information that needed it. Both sites have a Basics Tutorial
(created with H5P's Course Presentation tool), and an Advanced
Features/FAQs page that lists detailed instructions on how to use different
WordPress features. I've purposely kept the Advanced Features/FAQs
information limited to only the most used features. Occasionally, I'll add
new instructions to that page when I get a lot of questions about a feature
or think it is something that would be useful to users.

WPMU Dev (subscription required) has a series of videos that I've added to
our sites and find very useful. For example, see New! Navigation Menus
<https://wp5support.wp.unca.edu/new-navigation-menus/>. Unfortunately, the
videos are not captioned. For more information see: WPMU Dev Integrated
Video Tutorials
<https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/unbranded-video-tutorials/>

Hope this helps.
