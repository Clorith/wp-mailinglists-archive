Hi all:

We get questions from other schools from time to time about our in-house plugins, etc. With that in mind, we've created http://sites.duke.edu/development<http://sites.duke.edu/development> (which links to our project Trac) to share with others in the wp-edu community. You'll also find the source code and info on our custom plugins under Browse Source. We've had especially good feedback from our faculty and students on our implementation of a 'subsites' plugin (you can read more about that here: http://sites.duke.edu/getting-started/creating-subsites-for-students-or-groups/ ).

Thanks,
-Shawn

This is good stuff Shawn.  We are starting to build out something like this as well on our dev site recently:

http://dev.web.unc.edu/wiki/plugins-under-development/

We have several that might be useful for others and will add more documentation there.

Funny we are just down the road from each other.  We should collaborate more... just not during Basketball season... :)

I am submitting this on behalf of Harvard's Allie Ai who reports her messages to this list are being bounced. 

------------------------------------------

Hi there,
 
We need to clean up the existing tags that have been entered with minor text variations. We have quite some tags due to this problem and would like to find a plugin that allows tag merge, update and removal across multiple posts.  Has anybody done this and what plugins to use? Has anybody used these: 

?Term Management Tools? 
	<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/term-management-tools/>

?Simple Tags? 
	<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-tags/?>

Any tips and tricks would be greatly appreciated!
 
We are also looking for a plugin that allows us to display links to other posts that on the same or similar topics. Obviously, we need to control the number of links displayed and the styles. I understand that there can be performance issues when using such plugins, so I would appreciate your suggestions and experiences.  Has anyone tried the following plugins and which one is the best? Or have you used any other plugins that work really well?

Speaking of taxonomy cleanup, one of the frequent requests I've received from our Communications Division is for a tag to category convertor (and visa versa). There is a plugin available for this (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpcat2tag-importer/) and it's promoted on the tags and category pages within WordPress.  

Unfortunately, community feedback suggests its not working correctly with 3.2 (and the plugin itself states its compatible up to 3.0.5; it hasn't been updated since June 2010). I haven't tried it myself yet, though it's on my to-do list.

Does anyone know the status of this plugin? I posted a question about this to the WordPress support forums about two months ago, but alas have not heard back.

I like the idea behind the Multi-Site Cleanup plugin.  The policy you've outlined there seems sound to me (at least based on how I've seen our student groups and individuals using their WordPress sites).

Hi all,

Thanks Shawn for sharing this! It's interesting to look at your site because we @UBC has a similar setup.

We have two WP instance:
-UBC CMS http://cms.ubc.ca/ for building website
-UBC Blogs http://blogs.ubc.ca/ for blogs/buddypress

my team just moved all the code repository from SVN to GIT and we're also creating a public repo to share with wp-edu community. Once we have the public repo up I'll share it here. We do have some plugins on WP plugin repo already. Checkout  http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/ctlt-dev/

One of my faculty is interested in using Latex with WordPress. He came across a post on WordPress.com regarding native Latex support (thinking that it would be available in our self-hosted version as well):

http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/

My question for the group is ... what plugin is WordPress.com using to support Latex? We run WordPress in Multisite mode, so we're looking for something well tested in that environment.

This is the one I believe Wordpress.com<http://Wordpress.com> uses: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-latex/

I also use it on our UNC Multisite instance and it works great (http://web.unc.edu).

Here is a tutorial we put together for my users (I think mostly taken from the how-to):

Nifty. I hadn't come across Jetpack before. Is it safe to assume it plays well with Multisite?

There's a lot here that could be useful for us on both the academic and public facing sides of the house.

We're using jetpack in multisite and it works fine, except that each individual site activating the plugin needs to have wordpress.com account linked.  There isn't (or I haven't found any way) to do the wordpress.com integration across the whole network in one go.  (Not sure I would want to, anyway).

You can define an API across a whole network if you get permission from the Wordpress folks.  We did that when we were using Akismet.  You put it in the wp-config.php file as something like this: 

/** Define the Akismet key for spam and stats */
define('WPCOM_API_KEY', 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx');

Other plugins work like this too (Gravity Forms, and CAPTCHA are two others I define for the whole network so each site doesn't have to sign up somewhere).  

Using the Latex plugin I sent earlier I don't think you have to do this though.  You can set up your own server to generate it as well, but I just use the wordpress.com server to generate the latex code for my users.  Seems to work like a charm.  Never had any problems.

Cool. That's what we're doing for Akismet as well. Is there someone in particular whom I should contact at Wordpress about site-wide activation?

Mathjax is also a great solution.

And mathurl is worth being mentioned.

I can't find who we talked to, but this thread should help: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/anti-spam-for-multi-site-educationnon-profit.  I think that it falls under business signup.  We no longer use Akismet on a site-wide basis for our spam though because they require you put Wordpress.com<http://Wordpress.com> and Akismet in the footer of each site and we didn't want to have that limitation.  We not use TypePad instead (http://antispam.typepad.com/info/get-started.html) and allow users to set up their own Akismet API account if they want it in addition to TypePad.

Cool. That's what we're doing for Akismet as well. Is there someone in particular whom I should contact at Wordpress about site-wide activation?

For the record, that's not so anymore. Once upon a time, instead of 
paying discounted edu rates, an option for edus using Akismet was  free 
cost in exchange for those links. Now edus just have the same rates as 
companies.

Which is highway robbery given how most of these wordpress installs are run
at universities. The conflation of businesses and universities by the
wordpress community is one of its greatest blind spots in my opinion.

Also, were there any deals made with CUNY we should know about?

Akismet is a service that they have every right to charge for. It takes servers and people to run it. If we don't like it, we should find an alternative rather than wishing they'd donate free access to their service just because we're in education.

So... What are the viable alternatives? Ideally something that blocks both comment-spam and splog-blog signups?

Which is highway robbery given how most of these wordpress installs are run at universities. The conflation of businesses and universities by the wordpress community is one of its greatest blind spots in my opinion.

Also, were there any deals made with CUNY we should know about?

Also keep in mind that Jetpack doesn't require an API key. It authenticates with WordPress.com directly. I don't think the network activate trick from Akismet will work for it on a multisite install.

D'Arcy,

it's not that we have a problem with paying for Akismet, quite the
opposite. We just think the $900 price point is insane.  I can imagine
small businesses feel the same way.  it is more than our monthly external
hosting fees.

That said, we don;t use Akismet and Cookies for Comments is working well
for us, and you can use TypePad's Akismet code for free, but Akismet seems
to work better than the latter. All that said Cookies for Comments works
for now, but it is an pache hack, and once a spammer picks up on the trick
it is open season again.

D'Arcy,

Make that $550, seems they have lowered the price since last December, but
still way out of what we can pay.

It probably costs more to run a university than the rent on the 
buildings, too. :)

I realize budgeting at many institutions is screwed up, and I think it's 
sad that folks running WP someplace with a 95M yearly budget (10x what 
it costs to host all of WP.com) that's probably saving hundreds of 
thousands in software and maintenance costs can't get approval for 
10-20k/yr for things like Akismet and VaultPress.

At the same time we have small businesses making a few 100k a year 
signing up for both, the main difference seems to be less distance 
between the person holding the pursestrings and doing the work.

</rant> I know I'm in the wrong place to talk about this. :)

Matt,

To be clear DTLT at UMW has a $28,000 a year  budget and we run our WP
hosting install with 25% of that (besides payrolls) . Obviously you are not
in touch with what is happening in highered in terms of money, and I can
imagine you don't care given you are more of the Richard Branson travel the
world money entreprenuer type, but in the real world we have budgets, we
live on the public dime, and we are making the world safe for democracy,
not crude capital.

#occupyakismet!

Subject: [wp-edu] Akismet pricing
Message-ID: <CA+_L4gh-t7PU87cbSAJv0V2H3y1KPq1puU9njuGKYNTPZ-zJdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I work with the Akismet team at Automattic, and given that the topic
of Akismet pricing came up earlier on a different thread, it reminded
me that it's long overdue that I let you know what we've tried to do
for educational institutions and pricing.
First, a little background: long before spammers started getting as
sophisticated as they are now (and Akismet didn't cost us much to run)
Matt and Toni would offer academic institutions free use of Akismet in
return for a link promoting Akismet in the footer of every page that
it was used on. We did this pretty much on trust, and we had no
resources (or inclination) to enforce it. But it's been clear that the
informality of the arrangement hasn't stood the test of time: API keys
have been lent to non-academic projects, re-designs have abandoned the
footer and perhaps critically (for us) supporting the weight of spam
on .edu sites has become pretty expensive.
As we gave Akismet more resources, we also revisited the signup and
subscription processes. We tried to simplify and make clearer to those
that get real value from Akismet that they should actually pay for the
service. We had an Enterprise plan that was based around the number of
sites, and an API plan that was based around the number of API calls
(basically the number of comments submitted). Allowing users to pick
between the two meant that almost all of our users could find a price
point at which they were able to use Akismet, while contributing to
the costs of running it. With one glaring exception...
Academic WordPress installs do tend to be unique because they spawn
huge numbers of individual sites, many of which are used for specific
projects and are then abandoned (attracting lots of spam). This means
that these installs tend to have (a) a lot of sites and (b) a lot of
API calls.. making Akismet prohibitively expensive. But the
misconception has been that we don't care about this: it's really not
true, we just struggled to figure out a good solution for a while.
In fact, the Enterprise (site-based) pricing didn't seem to work as
well as we'd hoped for some companies too. Thinking about the
edu/multisite problem and also the issues that some companies were
having, we decided to simplify the plan altogether and said that for
the Enterprise plan ($50/month) customers could now use Akismet on as
many sites as they liked, but with a limit of 80,000 comments per
month.
So here's the exception: for .edu domains (only) using Akismet, we're
waiving the comment limit restriction. So you can use one API key for
a many sites as you like on your TLD, for $50/mo or $550/yr. So you
can have as many sites using Akismet as you like, so long as they're
hosted on either a subdomain or directory of [yourdomain].edu. There's
one small caveat: we simply don't have the resources to manage
invoicing, checks and Accounts Payable departments for this kind of
price: so we ask that you/someone pays by credit card or electronic
check. (You could also help my closing comments on unused sites.)
So -- that's the situation as it is now, and hopefully goes some way
to setting the record straight. It saddens me when I hear that Akismet
is unaffordable for academic institutions and they've had to move to
Typekit Antispam (if the age of their homepage and that Arrington
quote is anything to go by, it's not getting a lot of love these days)
or, worse, Captchas. Hopefully $50 a month makes it considerably
easier than it used to be. I know that it won't work for everybody,
but it might at least?allow more of you to use the service.
Happy to answer any questions and hear your feedback.
Best,
Pete.

Thanks for the update, Pete. That definitely sounds workable.

I understand the frustration and confusion about the ability of edu-institutions to pay. In my case, I work at a billion-dollar-a-year institution, but have a budget of $0 for the blogging platform. It only exists because I snuck it onto a server and support it on my own. I'm working to have it more properly managed on campus, but that's how things like this happen, and why it's often difficult to find funding for tools and services to support the effort.

And you guys run/host basically all the websites? That's criminal. I'm 
not going to ask what the Blackboard (or Eagles) budget is. :)

Do you want that to be larger? Is there something we could do as a group 
to help you lobby upstairs?

(The links under Blogroll and External Resources on

Pete,

That $50 a month makes total sense, this is great to hear we happy to get
on board with that as soon as possible.

Thanks, and I will be in touch shortly.

I appreciate a well written and thoughtful e-mail like this directly from
the source, rather than apples to oranges comparisons and simplifications
of people's budgets. Thanks for writing this, and the pricing seems
extremely reasonable. The frustration in the past has been due in part by a
lot of non-transparency. The reality was that we were being told we should
pay a lot of money for a single-feature service, which I recognize is
expensive for you all to run, but it's not a building, it's not a
maintenance/support contract (and comparisons to those things are not
helpful). A lot of use lobbied for using Wordpress in higher education with
the promise of open source helping the bottom line. We were being told we
should have no issues with paying 10-20k a year for spam filtering on the
free software we fought for (and continue to believe in). Nothing else to
add, other than thank you again for a clear, transparent post.

Thank you, Pete. It has been great to talk to you as you've worked through
this process, and like D'Arcy and Jim, I'm happy with the result. I do
wonder how many thousands of calls are going to be generated by a single
CUNY-wide Askimet license . . . . but I guess we'll soon see, since I've
already put in the request to purchase one!

Best,

Matt
