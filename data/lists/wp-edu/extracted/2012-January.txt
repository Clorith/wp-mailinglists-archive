Subject: [wp-edu] MultiSite Sitewide Query for CPTs/Taxonomies
Message-ID: <5CC08883-26FF-44F9-95C4-90D3CD1B726C@thecorkboard.org>

Hello everyone-

Over at UW-Madison's School of Library and Information Studies we're  
investigating using WP custom post types and taxonomies to develop  
ePortfolios for our students.  One of the biggest requests is the  
ability for the instructors to easily access artifacts (the CPT) based  
on a goals category (the custom taxonomy).

 From my searches this morning it looks as if there's not a plugin or  
real easy way to query across the entire site based on a specific CPT  
and taxonomy.  The much-used sitewide tags plugin seems to be the  
closest, but as we're not using "normal" posts and tags this won't do.

Have you investigated anything like this at your institution?  Any  
ideas or thoughts on how to push forward?

Thanks,

~Kyle M. L. Jones~

We are a k-8 school system and we use WordPress multisite for each of our buildings. For our administrators to keep track of web usage, we created a page template that forms a loop around switch_to_blog(), which allows us to gather information about each site, which is displayed on a single page. It is a rather large page load, with many different database queries flying around, but it gets the job done.

All you would need to do is to change what happens inside the loop to adjust for your CPTs and Taxonomies.  The end result would be a page long table with a cell for each site? in your case a portfolio.

This would need to go inside your theme's folder, and you will need to create a page, calling this template? then adjust accordingly. - - - -  http://dl.dropbox.com/u/30128463/page-site-info.php

Let me know if this helps - Chris

Thanks, Chris.  That is a helpful start.  I was able to get Sitewide  
Tags to populate my custom post types and am still working through  
that option.
