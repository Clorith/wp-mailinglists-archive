Hey Darcy,

Sorry to hear about your issues. I don?t have a recommendation for a partner in regards to Multi-Site but we use WPEngine very successfully for all our sites.

Thanks

Hi Darcy,

There could be a bright side -- There is nothing like a painful security failure to focus those that hold the purse strings on the benefits of managed hosting. This might be an opportunity to switch to one of the excellent managed hosting solutions that are now available for WordPress multi-site installations. Pagely.com and WPEngine.com are the most well know in this space in the US, and here in Canada I'm very partial to WPCloud.ca.

Using managed hosting very effectively offloads most security, backup and optimization issues onto the host. Since these are WP specialists with their reputations on the line they do a very good job of handling it.

It goes against the DIY ethic of a lot of higher education institutions, but it is a very effective way to get the job done.

Cheers,

Dan Bashaw

Message-ID: <CAGf3050KfeQSV9fy_4NY=tQopTFKo-0w_ix_xmNRvK-FVL6pWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

What are your websites' uptimes and how do you measure uptime?

I'll go first:

The uptime for my college's website is ~98.85%. Since I've yet to find one
automated metric that can indicate uptime across the whole
network/server/website stack, I've had to estimate this number. Estimates
have their benefits, but I certainly would like one definitive metric for
uptime.

Thanks,
Nick

There are external services that can do monitoring for you, like Pingdom, UptimeRobot, etc.

I only have numbers on our WordPress instance at the moment (which is not our main website). The problem is, with the account we have, it only checks the site every five minutes, so there could be short outages that it misses. With that in mind, it's reporting 100% uptime for the past year. I know this isn't entirely accurate because we have rebooted that server for kernel patches.

The numbers are only as good as the tool.

Hello all,

What process do you have in place to clean up your WP instance of old and inactive sites? Every summer we look at this and go through a process of manual identification (e.g. sites not updated in past 6 months) and go about trying to contact site admins for permission to delete. It's time consuming  and drudgery.

Thanks,

David

We've found that students will sometimes return to a site and pick it up again even after several years of inactivity. We want to make sure never to preclude that possibility, so we don't prune old or inactive sites at all.

I don't think I could trust any automated system, and I certainly don't want that manual drudgery. And I don't want a student to ever find that her work, no matter how preliminary and initial, has disappeared--or even give her the impression that she needs to tidy it up or make it disappear.

Is it really that big a drag on the system to have some inactive sites? (We are up to over 4,000 sites now, and probably only 50-60% are "active"--depending on your definition). Enough to justify the time consuming drudgery? Why not just let them remain?

This is good info Joe. According to our sys admin the huge number of tables (as you know WP schema isn't exactly normalized) starts to cause real issues with MySQL  backups. I'll ask him to delve a bit deeper into what those issues are.

Davis,

I would even see if you can't find all sites that only have one post, like
"Hello World," and delete those sites, so you can still clean out your
system, but keep the stuff that folks may want later on.  I know there are
some scripts for this we used a year ago or so.

No worries.

Jim, did you find a need to do this to improve system performance or other systems tasks like backups?

Davis,

I would even see if you can't find all sites that only have one post, like "Hello World," and delete those sites, so you can still clean out your system, but keep the stuff that folks may want later on.  I know there are some scripts for this we used a year ago or so.

We've found that students will sometimes return to a site and pick it up again even after several years of inactivity. We want to make sure never to preclude that possibility, so we don't prune old or inactive sites at all.

I don't think I could trust any automated system, and I certainly don't want that manual drudgery. And I don't want a student to ever find that her work, no matter how preliminary and initial, has disappeared--or even give her the impression that she needs to tidy it up or make it disappear.

Is it really that big a drag on the system to have some inactive sites? (We are up to over 4,000 sites now, and probably only 50-60% are "active"--depending on your definition). Enough to justify the time consuming drudgery? Why not just let them remain?

Yeah, your admins are right, too many tables in the database over time slow
down a system, no two ways about it. You have to incrementally grow your
server environment anyway, but cleaning out some sites you know no one used
is an easy win.

I've heard that, too, and it might be true in larger installs, but it just hasn't been the case for us so far.

We backup the entire MySQL database 4x a day. I admit it's many many thousands of tables (and more each semester, of course) but we're just copying the directory on the server to an evault, and it's all automated and goes quite smoothly.

But maybe you're a lot bigger than us?

(I hope I'm not jinxing myself by saying this!  Maybe someday we'll get to that promised point where those problems occur, but it hasn't happened yet).

Nope. Not bigger than that. I'd say your about twice our size right now. And just to be clear, we've never deleted a site without site owner approval.

Another reason we're looking at getting rid of sites that site owners have no use for any more is to allow us to see which themes and plugins can also be retired.

Subject: [wp-edu] Process for pruning/retiring inactive sites?

When I was at UMass Amherst I wrote something we referred to internally as
a "service handler" that dealt with this. It tied into our account
management system. When a user's account disappeared from the system for
whatever reason, the first thing it would do is simply make the blog
invisible, causing the blog to effectively disappear completely without
actually touching any of its content. It set a flag in a database table
making a note of when that happened. Some amount of time later (90 days, I
think) it would call another piece of custom code someone else wrote that
would export the blog's contents, pack it up into a tarball, and shove it
into a long-term archive directory just in case someone came back to us
screaming for it (which never actually happened while I was there). It then
actually deleted the blog for real.

When I was first handed responsibility for this system it had been running
for years and never been pruned. There were thousands of dormant blogs with
9 database tables each, and three files per table (we used the MyISAM
database engine in MySQL). This amounted to hundreds of thousands of files.
Even this absurd level of cruft had minimal impact, though. The only
practical issues it caused were that rsyncs took an absurdly long time due
to the sheer number of files, and the mysqldump utility was absolutely
unable to cope with that many tables in a single database. We did our
backups by quiescing the database and making a snapshot with LVM, though,
which was far more efficient than an SQL-level dump/reload anyway.
