Subject: [wp-edu] BuddyPress LMS,
 an issue with learning systems in different countries
Message-ID: <1277158935.7604.5.camel@rivalry>

Hi,
I'm Stas, the guy who's working to get implemented a LMS system into
BuddyPress.

I got an issue, which I really hope I will get some opinions about it
here.

http://sushkov.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/an-issue-with-european-and-us-learning-s/

If you're a teacher who had to deal with different learning systems in
different countries, please read this post and leave a comment here or
on blog. I really need to know all the details so we ain't gonna deal
with it in future.

Thanks in advance.
