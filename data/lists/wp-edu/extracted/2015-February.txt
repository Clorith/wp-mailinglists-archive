My favorite search replacement plugin is Relevanssi, but it doesn't index
media files.

SearchWP (premium, but inexpensive) does handle PDFs and has weighting
systems similar to Relevanssi. Its method of creating secondary search
engines (e.g. search limited to a custom post type) is more cumbersome than
it needs to be, and I've been struggling with it on a client project. In
theory, it also works with FacetWP (sold separately) to display filters on
your search results. In practice, this has also been challenging to
configure.

Wordpress.com VIP uses Elastic search. There's a plugin to help you
integrate it, and a NetTuts article if you prefer going down that road.

(I know the question was a month old. I've been sick and just noticed it!)

Thanks so much Stephanie,
I am currently tapping into Google custom search, and testing it.
My goal was to use the WP builtin search, and return GCS results into a custom page that I could add additional elements to (sidebar, etc.)
I've got it all working, and styling with CSS and Google fonts (to match the look and feel of the site)
I have

I like this approach, because I can see what is going on through Google?s backend.
I don?t have a lot of data up on the testing site yet, so my results are minimal.

If I have links pointing to pdfs, Google SHOULD return their results. Correct?

Hello WP-Edu-ers,

We are looking at integrating WordPress more tightly with our LMS via LTI (http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm).

Although we have our own internally hosted multisite instance that allows any of our users to serve themselves with new WP sites we are looking at cloud hosting that would provide the LTI integration.

Anyone have any experience with commercial WordPress hosters and/or LTI? If so any info you have would be appreciated.

Thanks,

David

Hi Richard,

At Brescia University College are using Google Custom Search via the Google CSE plugin, and it is doing a good job of indexing PDFs across our various sites.

Robust, simple, reliable and outsourced... Definitely my favorite way to handle search!

Cheers, Dan
