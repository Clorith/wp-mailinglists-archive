Happy New Year everyone!

I hope you don't mind me breaking the silence with what may be a silly 
question.

I've been looking for a way to put pages under categories, and have them 
show up as  list items in a category list. I realize I could just 
hard-code the menu and would do that as a last resort, but I'm looking 
to let Wordpress manage it.  And since so many of you are using WP as a 
CMS for your schools, I am hoping someone here can point me in the right 
direction.

Thanks in advance for any ideas you've got on this,

-Velda

I bookmarked this but haven't explored it yet:
http://www.stuff.yellowswordfish.com/page-category-plus/
"Page Category Plus allows you to assign categories to WordPress
'Pages' - which WordPress in it's natural state does not do. Unlike
prior versions of the old 'Page Category Organiser', it uses the same
categories you use for 'Posts' and, in effect, treats Pages as if they
were Posts."

Another idea: I ran across this suggestion of using WordPress
bookmarks to manage the navigation menu yesterday. Haven't tried it
yet, but it might be an option for you.

I wrote a plugin a while back to do this very thing, but haven't  
released it to the public. A few other folks have asked for it, so  
I'll clean it up over the weekend and pass it along.

That would be fabulous.  I'm still trying to convert my kids school to 
Wordpress from a very hairy Joomla install, and this would help 
tremendously.

Thank you for your suggestions too, Rachel.  I'll have a look at those 
links as well.

OK, I've checked these out, and they're close, but I need to treat the 
pages as categories rather than posts, so they'll show up in category 
lists, alongside other categories.  So my admissions category might have 
a few subcategories (like FAQs for example) as well as a page linking to 
an enrollment form.

Is that what yours does, Jeremy?

Sorry, no, my plugin doesn't do this. It simply lets you associate  
categories to a static page the same way you can associate categories  
to a post. It has a custom template function that will list the pages  
by category on the public side.

Sounds like what you want is a way to list both categories and static  
pages with the wp_list_categories() template function...is that right?  
Should be possible, but it wouldn't be very easy, especially the  
ordering and hierarchy among categories and static pages. Seems  
interesting, and in fact is something folks in my department have  
wanted for their department website. (I set up GMU's history  
department site with WP.)

In any case, I cleaned up and made my plugin available for download  
here:

http://clioweb.org/downloads/cwpagecategories.txt

It's a very simple plugin: lets you add categories to a page, and has  
a template function called cw_listcategories() that you can use in the  
sidebar to list pages under a category heading. You can also return an  
array of pages with cw_getpagesbycat($cat) and replace $cat with the  
category ID.

I used a messier version of this plugin on CHNM's site, here for  
example:

http://chnm.gmu.edu/research-and-tools/

"Research and Tools" is a category template page, which uses  
cw_getpagesbycat() in the category.php theme file to return all the  
static pages with the category "Research and Tools." Each project on  
that page is a static page.

I tested this with 2.7 only, but it should work OK in previous  
versions of 2.x, assuming they include jQuery. If you try it out, or  
improve it in any way, please share!

Jeremy

This seems like a tough one, at least to my limited skills.

We've recently moved to a new server, and got everything working right, but one strange problem with the feedwordpress plugin.

We've got about a dozen students blogging while studying abroad, and I'd like to aggregate their posts into one "Away and Abroad" blog, and it seemed like feedwordpress would be a good way to do this.

But for some reason, whenever I enter one of their feed URI's in the syndicate box I get "Error: I couldn't find any feeds at http://macaulay.cuny.edu/catalves/wp-rss2.php [HTTP request error: ]. Try another URL"  (that's a real url, as an example).  This happens whether I use http://blogURL/name/feed, or /wp-rss2.php or /wp-atom.php or /wp-rss.php no difference.

The feeds validate fine, bloglines and other aggregators can use them, even other wpmu installations can use them.

And the feedwordpress plugin on my own wpmu installation works perfectly for any feed that is *not* in my domain.  I can even take those same feeds and run them through Yahoo Pipes to create a new feed (with exactly the same content) and if I use that rss url, there's no issue--works fine.

I'm not running in php safe mode.  File permissions all seem to be fine. I don't see any obvious issues in the Apache error log.

Anyone have any other ideas for troubleshooting?  I'm thinking there must somewhere be a setting in the new server that is preventing http requests to these feeds in the same domain (same directory, in fact)? But how could that be and where would I find it to turn it off?

Any suggestions very welcome--I can go ahead and just use the Yahoo Pipes workaround, but it seems so klugey!

Thanks!

Joe

Doh! My mistake.  I just typed it wrong.  It's http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/catalves/wp-rss2.php .

(I did type it correctly when trying to add it to feedwordpress.  Honest!)

HI Joe,

Is it possible that an internal firewall is blocking the feeds?  That's what happened to me when I tried to use FeedWordPress on a school server recently. 

[I'll get in touch off-list with more details]

Best,

Matt

It looks like when the cache is expired on that blog, it takes a LONG time
to generate the feed. I was able to syndicate your feed after priming the
pump by manually hitting the url once.  The first time I tried to visit that
url, it timed out after several minutes. 

Perhaps you can use a Cron call to keep your feed cache up to date, or
change the time out setting and update time in feedwordpress to make it do
the same thing. If you time out after 30 seconds and then update every 10
minutes, I bet it will just start working.

(Note: I am using a modified FeedWordPress plugin that no longer validates
the feed before using it. I had to use a feed that was not supplying the
right mime content type. So, as a result, YMMV.)

Brian,

Very smart, thanks for that overview and explanation, it helps me
understand why certain feeds in FeedWordPress don't work what I
assumed was for more arbitrary reasons.

Best,
Jim

Well, none of the leads panned out.  This problem has got me totally stumped.  For now, I used the Yahoo Pipes workaround which is OK.  But eventually I'd like to figure this out.  Nothing I can find in any of the logs explains why the plugin would refuse to fetch feeds *only* from blogs in my own wpmu install.  Has to be something in my server configuration, but I sure can't figure out what.

Oh well.  Thanks again everyone for the help!

Hi Joseph,

I can think of one issue that might explain your symptoms:
-- cannot access feeds from a specific domain local to the server
-- can access those feeds externally
-- can access feeds external to the server

That is, the dns lookup for your own domain does not work on your
server. That is, externally everyone can resolve your domain
correctly, similarly code on your server can resolve external domains
correctly.   But code on your server cannot resolve it's own domain.

If you have shell access (ssh or telnet) or can run system calls from
your PHP code you could try running 'ping -c4 your.domain.name' to
check my theory.

If my theory is correct, I don't quite know how to solve it, as it all
depends on how your box is configured, a call to your hosting company
might help.


Hope this helps,


Mike

This is what I had in mind, too. If you are using Linux, just check the 
/etc/hosts :)

This looked like such a good lead--but doesn't seem right.

I can ssh to my server and ping my domain successfully, and there is an
entry in /etc/hosts -- all looks correct there.

Do you see the request being made in your apache logs? It could be that
apache is being "smart" and converting the request to a localhost
request, which could break the rewrite rules.

If your server is running chrooted, then it might be an entirely
different situation: the ping and DNS tools may not be part of the
chroot.

Have you tried simply looking to see what happens when you do a wget?

Well, we're definitely pushing the limits (and beyond) of my knowledge at
this point, but wget for
http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/catalves/wp-rss2.php

 gives this...

[root@macaulay macaulay.cuny.edu]# wget
http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/catalves/wp-rss2.php
--15:08:55--  http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/catalves/wp-rss2.php

HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found
15:08:55 ERROR 404: Not Found.

And of course that page is accessible, is found, from a browser.

So that seems to be the root (excuse the expression) of the problem? Mark's
suggestion about the rewrite rules being broken by Apache being "smart"?

I don't see anything in the apache error_log--

Apache's access_log says this for when I tried the wget

208.43.90.26 - - [14/Jan/2009:15:08:55 -0500] "GET
/eportfolios/catalves/wp-rss2.php HTTP/1.0" 404 313 "-" "Wget/1.10.2 (Red

And this for when I ask feedwordpress to try (from its wpmu admin page)

208.43.90.26 - - [14/Jan/2009:15:36:19 -0500] "GET
/eportfolios/catalves/wp-rss2.php HTTP/1.0" 404 313 "-" "WordPress/2.6.5,

404 errors? Right?  That's what it looks like.

I see a different IP address here :) So it is definitely something

Hmm...that *is* interesting.  Maybe a difference between internal and
external ip in the DNS.

But why do you have "mamaulay" instead of "macaulay"?  That shouldn't work
at all!

Sorry Joseph,

my fault. I use opendns on this computer, for my tests. So the wrong URL 
was actually redirected to OpenDNS homepage. But even after fixing it, I 
still see a different IP address here.

I see 208.43.226.164 too.   It sounds like you could have a firewall
doing NAT (network address translation). Or maybe you have a VPS
(Virtual Private Server) and the external address is the physical host
machine.

It sounds like it is time to talk to your hosting support.

You can now show them, with the wget examples, that your (sub)domain
resolves to different ip addresses internally and externally, and that
one wget works and one doesn't, please can they help.

Got it! Thanks, everyone!

Gerlando, Mike, Austin, Brian, Mark, Matt, Jim (I'm sure I'm forgetting
some).

What a great community.  You folks are terrific.

My hosting company uses internal DNS servers, so I added an entry there
pointing to the external ip address, and also changed the /etc/hosts file on
the server (which was pointing to the internal ip address, not the
external). Not sure which of those was the solution, but I don't think
either of them does any harm, so I did both.

And now feedwordpress syndicates those feeds just fine, wget works,
everything.

Thanks again--this was a real challenge to someone who is a linux sysadmin
only in the most illusory sense. If you guys hadn't pointed me in the right
direction I might never have gotten this fixed.

Indeed!
 
I had an email typed out (NO REALLY!!!) that said that we'd all let slide
the fact that he said he had a line in his hosts file & that should have
been the big clue.
 
I was saying that since he was getting the wrong IP address, he needed only
to delete the line from the file to use the same DNS servers we were using,
and that would solve the issue.  If only I had hit send!  LOL
 
Anyway Congrats Joe!

You are welcome, Joseph. It is a pleasure to help someone who wants to 
use Wordpress, especially when he works for the same institution ;)

Have a nice (snowy, sob) day!

Hi,
I'm soon going to start working on a project to remake our business school's
website. Having done a lot of stuff with Wordpress in the past I would like
to stick to using WP. However, I'm not a theme developer and can make only
minor changes to existing themes, which is what I've been doing so far.

My business schools (Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta) is one of the
top ranked B schools in India and hence the site needs to be spot on, on the
first try. Also there might be some scope for outsourcing the template
design. However all of the WP activity in education I've been seeing is in
the blogs space, and I'm wondering if I should explore some other options
(like Drupal, Joomla) for the design of the actual site. I'm pretty confused
in this regard.

What steps should I follow? Any advice in this regard would be great!

Cheers,
Abhishek

Hey Abhishek,

If you?re at all interested in developing templates for WP, I?d suggest the screencast series over at http://css-tricks.com - starting at screencast #25

As far as the platform, I?d say it depends on how much content and how you?re going to use it. Joomla! As a CMS is best suited for e-commerce sort of things. But if you?re going to have a LOT of content, it might be a good route to go. Drupal is different in that it?s more focused on community - user profiles, forums, discussion.

I personally think that WP does a much better job at connect people and letting them easily comment. Designing for WordPress really isn?t very hard and the platform is so extensible and quick that if you?re looking at say, 15 pages or so, it will work great. I use WP for a music festival our college holds each year and it?s definitely not a blog: http://www.agapefest.com but that will give you some idea of how you can use child/parent Pages as well as dynamic content in the form of news.

Hope that helps, and if you have any specific questions, I?d be glad to help you out.

Joel

Hi,

I'm soon going to start working on a project to remake our business school's website. Having done a lot of stuff with Wordpress in the past I would like to stick to using WP. However, I'm not a theme developer and can make only minor changes to existing themes, which is what I've been doing so far.

My business schools (Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta) is one of the top ranked B schools in India and hence the site needs to be spot on, on the first try. Also there might be some scope for outsourcing the template design. However all of the WP activity in education I've been seeing is in the blogs space, and I'm wondering if I should explore some other options (like Drupal, Joomla) for the design of the actual site. I'm pretty confused in this regard.

What steps should I follow? Any advice in this regard would be great!

Cheers,
Abhishek

You will hear different stories from a variety of places. Developers  
in education are no different than developers in other areas and will  
be evangelical about solutions.

I cannot fault them, any solution in large organizations requires  
work. Decisions can be based on knowledge, budget, enterprise  
requirements, data portability, and a host of other factors. Of course  
cooperation, trust, and the final outcome are probably the biggest  
areas that my administrators looked at.

In my case I run a website (http://www.nicholls.edu) where roughly 80%  
is built with single installations of WordPress. I ran though several  
CMS solutions, but was forced to make a quick decision on my own. I am  
the only staff member doing web-work, so I had the leverage to choose  
a tool that I could deal with quickly and efficiently. At the time  
WPMU was not an option, but it is sure on my wish list now. It started  
as a choice, so departments could chose between static HTML and  
WordPress. I did leave the door open for other choices (drupal,  
joomla), but no one has desired anything else.

My focus was on end users, so the solution needed to be easy to use,  
easy to train, and easy to troubleshoot. My primary users are  
administrative secretaries, so the skill level is mostly based on  
desktop word-processing applications. After training an entire  
division of roughly 30 administrators to use Dreamweaver, WordPress  
became a welcome replacement.

I did one meeting with our Web Committee and showed WordPress 2.0 in  
action. I showed a couple of other solutions both OSS and Commercial.  
The questions I encountered were:

1. Cost?
2. Development? How hard is it to replace you or this WordPress thing?
3. Time frame for conversion of existing sites?
4. Extendability?
5. How can this fit into other stuff like on-line learning and  
student / employee services systems.

No. 5 was left to a wait and see since we going through a massive  
upgrade to those systems, but our IT department likes to keep some  
separation between public and private systems anyway.

The easy answer:

It depends on your organization and those involved in the decision.
