Message-ID: <a3afc6ac2bbd4546a256cff9b2b05c11@ex13m1.cmpcntr.tc.trincoll.edu>

Hi All,
I have been looking for a way to show off featured sites in our multi sites network: http://commons.trincoll.edu/
I thought this would be easy to find - surely there must be a features sites plugin that uses the sites categories plugin right?
I like the functionality at the Harvard site: https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ but would hope for more visuals.
Does anyone have a good suggestion?
Thanks

Not for nothing but how frequently do you want those featured sites to
change? I would just do it manually since it would only take me ~15 mins to
select the sites, generate screenshots and quick blurbs and post up on a
central page. I would probably only change it once a month or less. Just a
suggestion :)

Hello all,
We launched our new WP site on Monday, a year in the making. (switched from Ektron)
Everything was done in-house. (I am a one man show here, with the support of our marketing staff)
Everything on the site is new (content, images, hosting, CMS, etc.) - we started with a blank slate.

I still have lots to do, but we needed to launch before the students came back.
Please let me know your thoughts:

iThemes Security
We are hosting with WP Engine. They disallow these plugins because they have their own native security.
http://wpengine.com/support/disallowed-plugins/

Enable media replace ? super handy
Using it, a must have for sure

Duplicate post ? good for templates that you can copy
Using it, a must have for sure

Google sitemap generator
Using Yoast sitemap generator

Relevanssi ? improves search capability
I?ve actually programed Google custom search to work on the site, and styled it. I am waiting for a full indexing before I implement. In the meantime, I am using the built it search :(

WP DB Manager ? archives DB backup
WP Engine handles backups, but I will look into it

A caching plugin like Super Cache or W3 Total Cache
WP Engine has their own proprietary caching

Otherwise, it looks great!
Thanks Steve!

Thx - Steve

It was great and would be great to have another bigger one.

Resending because I think I sent earlier reply from the wrong address.

We have had a handful of official WordCamp Eds specifically for academic
areas (including the CUNY one Joe references. We would happily support more
niche WordCamps. The WordCampus site is currently violating trademark with
the name/domain, and I believe Andrea Middleton has reached out (or is in
the process of reaching out) to discuss either amending the name to respect
trademark rules and/or to just go ahead and talk about doing it as an
academic WordCamp through the usual process. We've also been discussing
academic WordCamps recently with Anne McCarthy, so there's definitely a
resurgence of interest. It would be ideal to get people working together if
possible.

Quick question for Steve - doesn't WordFence do caching?  Why have a
caching plugin like Super Cache or W3 Total Cache?  We are having
performance issues and I'm wondering if the caching from WordFence is not
adequate.

Hello all,
We launched our new WP site on Monday, a year in the making. (switched from Ektron)
Everything was done in-house. (I am a one man show here, with the support of our marketing staff)
Everything on the site is new (content, images, hosting, CMS, etc.) - we started with a blank slate.

I still have lots to do, but we needed to launch before the students came back.
Please let me know your thoughts:

I recommend WP Super Cache. Zero configuration, just install and activate
(and maybe click ?on?). Reduced the load time on our WP network of ~50
sites from 1700-2300ms down to <500ms.



Meanwhile another colleague here was trying to use W3 Total Cache on a WP
network with 30-40 sites and because it gives you complete power and
control over caching options (like dozens of options) he could never get it
working, despite being a top notch system administrator.

Resending because I think I sent earlier reply from the wrong address.

We have had a handful of official WordCamp Eds specifically for academic areas (including the CUNY one Joe references. We would happily support more niche WordCamps. The WordCampus site is currently violating trademark with the name/domain, and I believe Andrea Middleton has reached out (or is in the process of reaching out) to discuss either amending the name to respect trademark rules and/or to just go ahead and talk about doing it as an academic WordCamp through the usual process. We've also been discussing academic WordCamps recently with Anne McCarthy, so there's definitely a resurgence of interest. It would be ideal to get people working together if possible.

We had a lot of issues with SuperCache on a very large multi-site and had to ditch it. It had problems expiring cache properly when used with some other plugins. For our multisite we ended up putting varnish in place. It?s not for the faint of heart though, as it took a lot of configuring to get right, but the overall performance has been excellent with over 30k sites.

I would have liked to use WordFence, but it?s a very heavy module. Most the customizations you can make directly to apache or the .htaccess file to accomplish the same thing. We thought about Relevanssi, with an elastisearch backend, but the team ended up going with the Reader plugin from wpmudev. 

I?ve been looking at WP Spam Shield lately, since this is one of the few plugins that will intercept spam before it hits the db. This would decrease possible outburst of those creative spammer kiddies.

Good point! Big sites should use Varnish, that?s definitely what I?ve heard.



We are still a WP network of sub-sites with under 100 instances. Small
networks might be the use case where WP Super Cache shines.

I think you might be looking for a ?portfolio? plugin. There are a lot of ones out there. We are using the one provided by the Divi theme on http://sites.psu.edu on our front page.

Subject: [wp-edu] WordPress for student/organization elections
Message-ID: <8810FD9943DD6A49868E0BBE4DDFCF3E676A1D393A@Mail1.tusculum.edu>

Is anyone using WordPress to manage student elections or nominations? The system would need to allow only students to vote (authentication from either LDAP or a pre-populated list of students) and prevent ballot stuffing while also allowing students to vote for multiple candidates/offices.
A specific use case would be Homecoming Court nominations: enrolled students login and are presented with a list of the other students by class and can nominate up to three male and three female students per class. I have written a homegrown system for this, but it is not in WordPress and I have not created a friendly administrative back-end for it. I?d love to find a WordPress equivalent.

Thanks,
Travis Crabtree

Hello all,

Anyone have a good "getting started" tip sheet that they give to student users that they are proud of and willing to share? Looking for something that covers the basics on posts, pages, and appearance and should include how to embed images, video, audio.

Thanks!

We are trying to figure this out ourselves. No need to recreate
documentation, BUT we are using Divi theme, and we don?t want to send users
to a confusing maze of Divi PageBuilder tutorials. Also use of our
particular plugins, and what they might TYPICALLY do in the site vs. ALL
the things they could do in the site. Would definitely be interested in
seeing others materials.

Might want to consider using this plugin

https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp101/

"Delivers a complete set of WordPress tutorial videos directly within the dashboard. Choose which videos to show, or add your own!"

This is a commercial, API-driven plugin where you can select the tutorials you want to use or to upload your own.

Other options: https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/tutorials

Thx - Steve

My experience with Slack (which has been great!) has only been with high-traffic, high-simultaneity, project-based teams.

So I'm curious how it would work/apply in a low-traffic, generally asynchronous group like this one.

In other words, count me in, too!

If Slack becomes our new mode of communication, perhaps we set up some automated message on wp-edu at lists.automattic.com<mailto:wp-edu at lists.automattic.com> to direct people to the channel. I'm likely getting ahead of myself but something to think about in the future.

So you?ll need to invite people specifically. The only way ?automatic?
sign-up works is via domain, e.g. @x.edu or @gmail.com. I don?t know if
there is a way to make it fully public, anyone can sign up?

So you?ll need to invite people specifically. The only way ?automatic? sign-up works is via domain, e.g. @x.edu<http://x.edu> or @gmail.com<http://gmail.com>. I don?t know if there is a way to make it fully public, anyone can sign up?

Well, that was easy :-) Here?s the URL: https://wp-edu.slack.com/ I?m looking forward to the engaging conversations!

If Slack becomes our new mode of communication, perhaps we set up some automated message on wp-edu at lists.automattic.com<mailto:wp-edu at lists.automattic.com> to direct people to the channel. I?m likely getting ahead of myself but something to think about in the future.

Good morning all,

What are your thoughts about using Slack to manage communication for this group? http://slack.com

I?d be happy to help with setting that up if there?s interest.

Jessica,

Not sure anyone else is having this issue, but I can't join/sign-in with
existing slack ID that is working for another team. Might we need an invite?

I might not be one of them - I'm not able to get through, is there an invite that can be sent out?

Jessica,

Not sure anyone else is having this issue, but I can't join/sign-in with existing slack ID that is working for another team. Might we need an invite?

Well, that was easy :-) Here's the URL: https://wp-edu.slack.com<https://wp-edu.slack.com/>/ I'm looking forward to the engaging conversations!

If Slack becomes our new mode of communication, perhaps we set up some automated message on wp-edu at lists.automattic.com<mailto:wp-edu at lists.automattic.com> to direct people to the channel. I'm likely getting ahead of myself but something to think about in the future.

Hello!

I'm working with a team of folks on a project that will involve 8th graders building websites. One of the things we're considering is gamifying their experience to give them "badges" for specific tasks. Has anyone worked with any gamification plugins or systems within WordPress that you can speak of or recommend?

Thanks!

Hi Hillary,

We are running a pilot project here at UBC using BadgeOS + some custom add ons and  LearnDash  some docs:
http://wiki.ubc.ca/Sandbox:OpenBadges/Faculty_Guide/Web_Design/Create/Implementation

We are also planning on using Learning Locker http://learninglocker.net to track earned badges so in the case of the WordPress site disappearing there will be a record. We developed this plugin to enable: that https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-experience-api/


Cheers,
-Scott

I?m looking at using it for our International Programs pages but have a lot to learn as far as getting it set up. Did you do a storyboard first or how did you plan for your layout?

Hello!

I?m working with a team of folks on a project that will involve 8th graders building websites. One of the things we?re considering is gamifying their experience to give them ?badges? for specific tasks. Has anyone worked with any gamification plugins or systems within WordPress that you can speak of or recommend?

Thanks!
Hillary
