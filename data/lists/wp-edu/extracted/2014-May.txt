Good morning Nick,

Thanks for setting this up!  Will the sessions be recorded and made available to attendees for later viewing?  We have an all-hands meeting that morning, so I would miss some of the sessions.

I will be involved with a week-long academic institute that day and cannot attend either. ( I was hoping to do a presentation on how Granite State College uses WP as an e-portfolio system for its Prior Learning Assessment program, but I won't be able to. If anyone is interested, I can produce a narrated slideshow of a NERCOMP presentation I did last year on the topic. It can be published among the other resources for this event.)

Recording would be ideal. I am very interested in the program.

Thx - Steve

I'm wondering the same thing. An office assistant registered on my behalf. I have an EventBrite "ticket" but no instructions about how to find the conference online. Does someone have a URL?

Thanks,
Nick
