Subject: [wp-edu] GSoC 2010, BuddyPress for teaching
Message-ID: <1270340557.5928.12.camel@rivalry.c7.campus.utcluj.ro>

During the last #wordpress-gsoc chat, Jane pointed me to the
ScholarPress, a community of WordPress plugins developers that are
writing code to make WordPress useful in education. Their plugin,
Courseware is built for WordPress and currently offers the following
features:

      * manage schedules
      * manage bibliography
      * manage assignments
      * manage general course information

>From what I heard the plugin also works with BuddyPress, but making it
depends on WordPress (shortcodes, wp-admin) isn?t exactly a perfect
integration. The idea what came is to port ScholarPress to BuddyPress.
In details, to make SP aware of BP groups, and treat them as classes of
students. Assign schedules per group, add bibliography to scheduled
courses, so on for assignments. From the upstream TODO list, I also saw
the need of a grade-book and I would also add a notification system
(send a private message if a course is upcoming or a new grade was
posted).


More on the internal part?
It will require changes like, split the courses apart from schedules.
Because SP will be groups aware, it will be more logical to create
courses and link bibliographies and assignments to them, after what
publish them in a schedule. Also I would consider adding an upload
option for the courses that require annexes or attachments (later, you
can bundle those with Google Docs viewer or psview).
About the gradebook, I liked the idea used for kb-gradebook, and I think
it?s the bare minimal implementation of grades assignment I can consider
as a starting point (read the csv file, and assign group members to
marks).


About users?
In most of the education centers students are managed using a LDAP or
ActiveDirectory. So bringing some core functionality into such a plugin
also should be considered. I know you?ll jump that there are plenty of
plugins that offer LDAP integration, but hey, none of them (afaik) will
offer you options to integrate two baseDN?s into the same instance (this
can be really useful for role mappings also, divide students from
teachers).

I?m a student and at our university I had the opportunity to play a
little with Moodle, so the above idea is based on my experience. It
would be nice to hear some opinions from persons who are really involved
into teaching process and what would they like to see in such a new
ScholarPress.

There's also a post I wrote (this is a copycat) about this idea at:

Thanks.

Hi, I just recently joined the wp-edu list and got your comments on the 
Scholarpress plugin.  I was very excited to see that others were trying 
to use Wordpress for courses beyond kb-gradebook.
I installed it on my ESL/EFL site and went to configure it to discover 
that it was more of a reference tool for offline classes than a plugin 
designed for giving courses completely online using Wordpress. I'm not 
saying it is bad. I found what it does very interesting even though it 
is not what I've been looking for.
I have been working on my own  testing & gradebook plugin with the goal 
of teaching online so the quiz scores get posted to the gradebook as 
soon as a test is taken not something that requires a CSV file or other 
manual entry.
I still have to try to set up course descriptions and homework schedules 
for mine so I was very interested in checking out Scholar press.  I only 
saw the option to set up one course description and the scheduling seems 
to be for fixed dates.

I'd like homework scheduling and all related tasks to be flexible for 
days from enrollment so I could have students starting on different 
days, but their assignments and tasks would be different because they 
are in different stages yet it would be manageable since it would be 
following a syllabus.

While Kb-gradebook is ideal for an off-line course to post grades, it is 
impractical for true online classes to force the teacher to go through 
that busy work of manually updating a csv and uploading it instead of 
creating his or her course content online and adding grades as needed.

I have also been trying to use Moodle (after trying Atutor) to design a 
course over much of the last year, but I find its administration to be 
more than frustrating which is why I've gone to programming my own 
plugins for Wordpress which I already know and can use for content 
management. This way at least I can have something up and working for 
people to use even if it only serves the testing and gradebook function.

I'm curious how much conflict there is in design and planning of plugins 
from the off-line course resource to the completely online course. I'm 
also curious about how much teachers who normally give courses off-line 
bring their fixed-exact-date-linear thinking to their online course design.

Are there any AJAX programmers on the list? I'd like to extend my 
testing to include adding javascript based quizzes (drag and drop, 
ordering, matching), but I don't know how to take the results and pass 
them to a PHP script for processing.

Hey, thanks for quick reply. I'm also new here so there are a lot of
things I need to know to understand the demands. Hope I'll get some of
the answers here.

About your plugins, did you publish them to plugins directory?

Yes, that was the first thing I saw just by reading the existing code/db
schema. As I wrote already, splitting courses from scheduling process,
should bring the flexibility you were looking for. The idea is to start
with defining courses, and select them from a drop down list (sort of)
when creating schedules. Also this approach, will leave more space for
options for schedules (of any kind).

You're right. I just think kb-gradebook was created for cases when
mid-terms or exams are given in written, what you want is more like test
papers?

That's why I brought this discussion, let's make something that beats
moodle.

I know ajax, and can help. Christopher, I'm trying to make from this
idea a proposal for Google Summer of Code, so would be really cool to
get a list of features you would like to see in
current ScholarPress plugin. Also, if there are any plugins that in
someway are useful to you as a teacher and require upgrades,
improvements, list them (I will consider adding them to the proposal
list, port them to BuddyPress). Although the idea is for BuddyPress,
don't take it as an overhead, BuddyPress already has plugins for
Group Wikis and Forums, and bringing learning tools into it, is exactly
what a modern Moodle should look like. WordPress is cool, but using
BuddyPress makes it just more powerful.

Looking forward you reply.

I haven't one because I only started a few days ago so I'm still making 
rather big changes. It all works for creating the database tables, 
updating the gradebook, adding off-line homework grades, and deleting 
grades, but I still need to figure out how courses would work. Would I 
want separate gradebooks for each course?  Right now I just have fields 
for group and series id(course)   yes it would be easy to add the series 
ID to the course table name, but all the previous entries would still be 
in the old gradebook table and I wouldn't want to deal with angry users 
e-mailing me that their gradebook is now empty.
Also most of the variables are set in my php code instead of options in 
a wordpress options page.  I plan to create one which can override the 
defaults if set, but that requires more investigation.

Currently I'm using a script which uses HTML forms and a separate file 
for the answers. I like this system because it means I'll always have my 
quizzes, but I'm not sure if the general public would want to create and 
upload those files to their plugin directory. I know that most tasks 
that I think are normal and easy like editing HTML, changing a 
variable's value in a script,  and using FTP are extraordinary concepts 
to your average internet user.   I'll probably need a script that will 
generate the question form and answer list file for them.  The functions 
for adding and updating the gradebook are separate so it could be 
replaced with a different quiz system as long as the information can be 
passed to a function in php.

Personally I'd want to have a general course info page and a page for 
each course, but there really is no need to do that in a plugin since 
wordpress pages would work fine for that, but a plugin would need to 
have a way to check enrollment for the course perhaps using a custom 
field with the course ID to call the plugin and then check a course 
enrollment table.  If the visitor is not enrolled they would need to 
sign up (and need someway to have paypal integrated on signup or place 
the membership in a pending status at first.)
The only issue I see with this idea (which is what I'll probably do 
eventually) is that someone would need to first sign up with the site 
for the system to check to see if they are enrolled. If they are members 
but logged out of wordpress, the system wouldn't know what to look for.
of course if you don't want to have any control, you could just assume 
that everyone who joins the site is part of each and every course and 
they will take quizzes and tests as they desire. That works fine until 
you get to the issue of giving homework. You don't want every person who 
joins your site to get homework for every course!

I have my quizzes online so when someone takes them, the score is 
calculated and the gradebook is updated right away. Obviously not every 
assignment can be checked by the server, but most can if the test is 
online. That's why kb-gradebook is not right for online courses. It just 
wasn't designed for that purpose.  I'm still hoping to learn how to send 
scores to the updating script for a javascript based activity. I'd like 
to have activities appear too.   I imagine having a page with a course 
syllabus telling the student to read certain pages  and doing certain 
activities which would just take advantage of Wordpress page 
management.  When games are run, the game would update the gradebook 
with a score of 100, etc.  for the logged in student upon completion, 
but if a game is not php, I don't know how to send that information 
through so for the moment I'm stuck with true/false and multiple choice.

That's a big goal :) so it is important to let wordpress do what it does 
best and only add the features that are missing like payment, testing, 
homework, task updates, and gradebook.

I like Buddypress, but I don't think it is currently a good option for 
course management. It is great for more interaction (like the messaging 
system)  and forum integration, but the code is very new and Buddypress 
generates a huge amount of mysql queries so you'd almost have to have a 
dedicated server for more than a few students on the site at a time.  
Why force the user to have Buddypress to use a plugin?  Making a plugin 
depend on another plugin to work is not great design. If that other 
plugin breaks or changes in a way that is incompatible, your plugin 
stops working too!
It would be for the best to let the plugin do what it is supposed to do 
with or without Buddypress so no functionality would be lost if 
Buddypress has to be disabled due to server load or compatibility issues.

Well, for scholarpress to work for me, it would need to be redesigned to:
1. give homework and other tasks based on days from course enrollment 
(I'd like to see email updates sent to enrolled students. It really 
isn't practical to expect students to log in to the site frequently to 
know what they should do.)
The mailpress plugin added an autoresponder option, which is great, but 
I am not sure how to automatically add someone to an autoresponder 
series since I've only just set that up for a general list.  Perhaps it 
would be good to check with that plugin developer and see how that is 
done perhaps the same code could be integrated and the tables could be 
shared so that when a logged in wordpress user joins a course, they are 
auto-added to the autoresponder series for that course? Yet again I 
wouldn't want to have to have Mailpress installed to get the alerts sent 
out.
I suppose this would require learning how the wordpress mail and cron is 
set up.
2. set membership to pending and/or have a paypal option. There should 
be a course id number which can be changed by the admin so I can later 
use the same table info in my own plugin(s)
3. allow more than one course be added.
4. not force me to use the plugin's course pages since Wordpress is the 
CMS. I don't need bloatware! The plugin should not manage content. It 
should manage the course features... I hope that makes sense.  Wordpress 
should continue to manage site registration and user profiles (an issue 
I have with Buddypress for using separate profile data)

I'm very excited to see where this can go.  WordPress as a course management system is really already quite viable--for more experienced and skilled users.  For the average teacher, there is still some smoothing out to do.

Let me add a little to the discussion, not from the programmer's point of view (I am decidedly a novice in that area!) but from the teacher's point of view.  I've been teaching fully online courses since 2000, and teaching in the classroom for much longer than that (decades, I hate to admit!).

I am currently teaching a fully online course using WordPress as the platform http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/alternateworlds (and I've blogged about it extensively and will continue to do so at http://prestidigitation.commons.gc.cuny.edu ) --and yes, I am using KB Gradebook, yes, the class is fully online, and yes, it's been quite successful.

That point, I think illustrates a critical item that should be included in this project.  In providing what teachers need, it's important not to imagine that the way one teaches himself is the only or even the most desirable way.  This is true whether we're talking about enhancing classroom courses or teaching fully online courses.

I understand Christopher's (excellent) points about having quizzes that are created online and graded automatically and the grades automatically entered into the gradebook.  That would be a terrific feature to have--but it's not necessarily only for fully online classes.  Many face-to-face classes could use that feature, too.  And it's not at all true that all fully online classes work in that way or anything like it.  It's only an essential feature IF your class uses that kind of quiz (with limited options--very specific fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, or true/false).

For many online classes, including mine, the majority of the assignments and grading are not of that type at all.  In a literature class (which I usually teach) or an interdisciplinary seminar (which I'm currently teaching), the assignments are papers and projects, which absolutely require the kind of functionality which KB Gradebook provides and which an automatic-grading plugin would NOT provide.  Specifically, I'm talking about the ability to provide students with extended feedback and comments, not just a score or letter grade.  Any gradebook which does not provide that ability, would not be very useful for this kind of class.

I'm also a little worried about the idea of having any "one-size-fits-all" solution.  There are many, many different models of classes and programs.  From stand-alone independent-learners, to k-12 classes, to proprietary training programs, to "traditional" higher education in established universities, the variety is huge.  And the needs--in terms of assignments, enrollment, assessment, organization, scheduling, etc. etc. are all very different.

It would be a shame to even try to recreate Blackboard or Moodle or any of the other monolithic LMS's that already exist.  The beauty of using WordPress (or any small-pieces-loosely-joined solution) is that it can be accommodating to all the different models and approaches.

So I would recommend, very strongly, that any approach to making new LMS-type plugins for WordPress should keep them atomized and specifically tailored to specific tasks.

Let's not have one gradebook to rule them all, or assume that every online course operates in the same way--or every face-to-face course operates in the same way.  Let's have the option to use fixed-exact-date as necessary.  Self-paced as necessary.  Payment, testing, etc. as SEPARATE modules--and many different varieties of each one.

We really should not be thinking of beating moodle or blackboard at their own game.  It's not a good game or one that has much of a future.

Again--none of this is meant to be critical in the sense of stopping progress!  I'm just ecstatic to see the project getting rolling, and we should see it as opening up possibilities, rather than closing than down.

thank you for your comment on gradebook feedback.  in my test/gradebook 
plugin concept which is still in a very early non-public version  I 
added a way to add external tests/homework grades external in this case 
meaning anything that can't be graded by the scripts on the server.  I 
basically want to get away from the kb-gradebook model for my online 
courses since I hate busy work, but of course if it is the best solution 
for someone they should use it!
You mentioned needing to give feedback in the gradebook. Could you 
explain that a little?  I imagined that feedback would be given by email 
or messenger.
" ...the assignments are papers and projects, which absolutely require 
the kind of functionality which KB Gradebook provides and which an 
automatic-grading plugin would NOT provide. Specifically, I'm talking 
about the ability to provide students with extended feedback and 
comments, not just a score or letter grade. Any gradebook which does not 
provide that ability, would not be very useful for this kind of class."

What feedback/functionality would you want added to a testing/gradebook 
solution? Just a text comment to appear by a grade when viewed by a 
student? I don't remember reading on the kbgradebook plugin page about 
it having a feedback function at all!

I agree that it would be best to keep those different tasks as separate 
plugins, but if there is no interaction between them like sharing 
database tables and/or options then manual data entry would be required 
for more tasks which goes against what I am hoping for in an LMS.

Just wanted to add my voice to Joseph's. Don't try to make WP into an LMS.
It won't work anyway (for example, you have to choose your authentication
method and there can be only one, so you're either an open system or a
closed one--no way to have partly-open, partly-closed). But if we can find
areas where the full library of WP, including plugins and widgets, is weak
in terms of higher education, then improving those would be most welcome.

I too am an advocate of mixed systems. My virtual courses all, consist of an
open area that anyone can read, with a closed discussion forum (to respect
students' privacy). Even there, authentication is an additional burden, but
as my classes have only about 30 students, I'm willing to put in the extra
time.

My courses are old (oldest dates to 1994) and are showing their age--web
pages with an external forum, and no WordPress in sight--but they might
serve as an instructive comparison to the really excellent work Joe has
done. The home page of each has links to the others, so I'll just list one.
http://boisestate.edu/courses/crusades/
I do blog about this a bit
http://knoxhistory.blogspot.com/
and yeah that's Blogger. I'll get it moved one of these Fine Days.

Anyway, folks can look at mine and Joe's and see even in these two areas how
radically different approaches can be -- and the range would be greater if
we had someone from Health Sciences or Architecture or the Performing Arts
or Physics. I echo Joe's basic objection to the big LMS systems: one size
doesn't fit all and going down that road is actually a significant deviation
from the basic principle of a university (which is a collection of different
disciplines). And I second his preference for the loose collection approach.

I have a couple of things I'd love to see as improvements. One, a way for
*me* to rate posts in discussion and to have those accumulate. Secondary to
that, a way for me to reference my rubric quickly while rating, and a way to
browse on two axes: by student and by thread. Nobody does this really
elegantly yet.

The second thing I'd love to see is a versioning system. I've modified my
courses over the years and in so doing I simply overwrite what was there
before. I'd like to be able to have kept each version of my course *and* to
have kept each forum with each course, so that any of my students could
return not only to the course the way it is today, but the way it was when
*they* took the course. Imagine how useful this would be if all students
could do this with all their courses.

FWIW, Christopher, I don't need a feedback system in a gradebook. I don't
actually use a gradebook, as I never have all that many assignments. In my
upper division courses, just the single term paper. In my lower division,
three essays. A gradebook is overkill, and comments of course go directly
into the paper or essay (which come to me as attachments). Another example,
I guess, of diversity of method among teachers and across disciplines.

I do, however, give "progress reports", which are really just feedback on
how they are doing in discussion. I only do that twice, so again I don't
need a gradebook, but if I were giving grades weekly, then perhaps there. At
the very least, an easy way to quote would be helpful, or maybe links back
to the post that I'm commenting on. This is just standard scholarly dialog
stuff -- cite your sources. In this case, the sources are the students'
posts.

I again agree with Joe. Grades without comments are not of much help to the
student, they only benefit the administrator.

Stas-

Like Joseph mentions in a later response, I too am ecstatic that this idea has been brought up for a GSOC proposal.  Also like Joseph, my developer skills are near to none but we both have institutional experience working with LMS supporting professors/teachers and looking at the LMS from a student's perspective.  I've been using BuddyPress/WordPress as a LMS for two semesters and have had much success (side note: I develop and maintain the site, I'm not the professor).  You can find out all about my views on WP as LMS and how I've used it here: http://wpmu.org/wordpress-as-a-learning-management-system-move-over-blackboard/

Let me put this out there for you: I can't develop but I'd be more than willing to work side-by-side with you to conceptualize, mockup, and thoroughly test what you're looking to achieve.  In fact, I've been mocking up a LMS type theme that incorporates some of the things you talk about (I'll e-mail it to you if you're interested).  Basically, I'm here to help.   I'd venture to guess Joseph would volunteer some time as well ;)

For now though I'll respond to some of your comments below and will respond to Joseph in a later response.

Thanks,

~kyle~

I think you're right on here.  Shortcodes aren't seamless.  And when we're talking about using WP-as-LMS with a wide user audience with differing skills, shortcodes wouldn't be the best way to go.  We need something that has a comprehensive, UX-focused admin panel.

I look at groups with the same lens you do and it makes a lot of sense to me.  I know Joseph writes in a later post that we shouldn't focus any kind of LMS functionality on BuddyPress, but I think we can agree that the organization is logical.

Good lord does WP need a gradebook. A comprehensive, secure, stable gradebook.  KB-gradebook is our only option and it fails every time for me, as Joseph documented here: http://prestidigitation.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2010/03/15/kb-gradebook/

As for the docs, I'm starting to use BP Group Documents for this: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-group-documents/
But this is on the front end and I'd like something to be on the backend (or both?).

I think you'll find as you dig into this that user roles might become complex - at least I see them as such.  Especially when it comes to the backend options for managing the LMS plugin/suite of modules.  I.e., you might need these roles with descending amounts of functionality:
-Super admin = full site functionality
-Instructional technologist = full LMS functionality (control over LDAP, course creation, user creation, assign students to courses, everything else/etc.)
-Professor/instructor = limited LMS functionality (gradebook, assignment creation, general course moderation, archive course/assign course visibility)
-TA = same as professor sans gradebook?, or maybe the professor can choose the functionality available to the TA
-Student = basic user role, content creator (but has access to their grades on the backend, ability to comment on grades directly to professor)

Stas, I think it's great that you're thinking this way and see the inherent opportunities in a WP/BuddyPress combination as an LMS.  Let me know how I can help.

Thanks, Skip, for the link to your course.  I had heard of your work but somehow had never actually seen your course sites, and they really provide an excellent set of models.  The idea of partly open and partly closed is an important one for me (and for my students). And using the variety of resources and evolving as the options change is just as important. I also would like a truly elegant discussion board grading solution...none of the lms solutions really have that.

As far as the gradebook itself, Christopher, I think we might be running into a disconnect between scoring and grading. Comments and extended feedback are really the heart of what grading can be if it is a tool for development and improvement beyond assessment. KB gradebook, because it is just taking anything the instructor enters, gives the opportunity for those comments and detailed responses right there on the grades page for the students, not just letter grades or numeric scores.  From the instructor's point of view, this is much less than work than composing a separate email or message to each student, because the feedback is all there in one place and saved so on assignment number three i can look back and see (it is in the same row on the spreadsheet) exactly what i said to the student about assignment number one. It is also more secure than email (important, because grades are federally-protected student information for public institutions), and easier to back up in multiple locations.

From the student's point of view, too, they can see the representation of their progress and the comments and feedback in a single word press page.

It is definitely busywork to grade multiple choice or numeric quizzes, and I am all in favor of avoiding that. But grading papers and projects is the bulk of the work i do in a course and that is not busywork! So anything that helps make that easier in terms of staying organized and getting the info out to students efficiently and securely is really important.

To go back to discussion forums for a minute...I can't say enough about the simple press forum plugin. It doesn't quite have the refined discussion grading that Skip is talking about, but it does have ratings by stars or thumbs-up/thumbs-down. And the privacy options are fine-grained and controllable.

What I think I would like most but am still missing is a good full-featured dropbox plugin for students to submit assignments and have the instructor (and other students? Groups?) receive and send them back. I'm currently using a plugin that I tegrates with dropbox.com<http://dropbox.com>. It is ok but not ideal, because it is really only one-way.

Joe

Just wanted to add my voice to Joseph's. Don't try to make WP into an LMS. It won't work anyway (for example, you have to choose your authentication method and there can be only one, so you're either an open system or a closed one--no way to have partly-open, partly-closed). But if we can find areas where the full library of WP, including plugins and widgets, is weak in terms of higher education, then improving those would be most welcome.

I too am an advocate of mixed systems. My virtual courses all, consist of an open area that anyone can read, with a closed discussion forum (to respect students' privacy). Even there, authentication is an additional burden, but as my classes have only about 30 students, I'm willing to put in the extra time.

My courses are old (oldest dates to 1994) and are showing their age--web pages with an external forum, and no WordPress in sight--but they might serve as an instructive comparison to the really excellent work Joe has done. The home page of each has links to the others, so I'll just list one.

I do blog about this a bit
<http://knoxhistory.blogspot.com/><http://knoxhistory.blogspot.com/>http://knoxhistory.blogspot.com/
and yeah that's Blogger. I'll get it moved one of these Fine Days.

Anyway, folks can look at mine and Joe's and see even in these two areas how radically different approaches can be -- and the range would be greater if we had someone from Health Sciences or Architecture or the Performing Arts or Physics. I echo Joe's basic objection to the big LMS systems: one size doesn't fit all and going down that road is actually a significant deviation from the basic principle of a university (which is a collection of different disciplines). And I second his preference for the loose collection approach.

I have a couple of things I'd love to see as improvements. One, a way for *me* to rate posts in discussion and to have those accumulate. Secondary to that, a way for me to reference my rubric quickly while rating, and a way to browse on two axes: by student and by thread. Nobody does this really elegantly yet.

The second thing I'd love to see is a versioning system. I've modified my courses over the years and in so doing I simply overwrite what was there before. I'd like to be able to have kept each version of my course *and* to have kept each forum with each course, so that any of my students could return not only to the course the way it is today, but the way it was when *they* took the course. Imagine how useful this would be if all students could do this with all their courses.

From an admin perspective this is probably true.  BuddyPress tends to run slowly when pushed - at least on my shared hosting account even with W3cache enabled and WP-DBmanager doing some cleanup occasionally.

But from an instructor's angle, BuddyPress increases communication peer-to-peer and peer-to-professor in non-standard ways that a typical LMS usually doesn't enable.  This interaction, as I have observed, leads to more class engagement and anecdotally more learning.

I see your concern with this.  I'd counter by saying that BuddyPress has WordPress (the Organization) support since Andy Peatling and JJ Scooby are involved.  This isn't a plugin that is going to go by the wayside.

I guess I see groups & courses as having this natural relationship and that it's tough to envision a non-BuddyPress WP-as-LMS.  But you're right, not everyone would want the BuddyPress features (but why not?!).

But logging into the site is de facto practice in my experience with Blackboard.  However, extending notifications beyond e-mail to RSS and maybe SMS would be a nice change.  I'm in agreement with you though, we need to provide multiple ways to keep track of dynamic course content like assignment and grade updates.

Ah, but again BuddyPress adds key functionality with its profile data.  Completely customizable - something WP doesn't do out of the box.  I know I create a lot of profile fields for input so that the professor I assist can get some key information on his students (if they provide it, which most do).


@Joseph

> I'm very excited to see where this can go.  

Glad our paths continue to cross. :)

> WordPress as a course management system is really already quite viable--for more experienced and skilled users.  For the average teacher, there is still some smoothing out to do.

Yep.  They way you and I use BP/WP as LMS isn't something that a general user can pick up and run with on the fly.  It does take a bit of courtship....

> So I would recommend, very strongly, that any approach to making new LMS-type plugins for WordPress should keep them atomized and specifically tailored to specific tasks.

I couldn't agree more.  Keep it focused on modules (parts of the plugin as a whole) that can be switched on and off depending on need.  I advocate for complete customization of the LMS for the professor but also for the student.  Of course, this granularity of customization, I imagine, increases complexity with the plugin as a whole.

> We really should not be thinking of beating moodle or blackboard at their own game.  It's not a good game or one that has much of a future.

That's an interesting statement...  I think my approach to WP-as-LMS is motivated by the fact that I do in fact want to beat Blackboard and create a separate alternative to Moodle.  It's about options - preferably free options created by a community that truly cares about their online learning environment.  I'd agree that Blackboard doesn't have a happy future years away, but institutions still buy-in to this behemoth because it has a solid foothold in the LMS domain and it will stay as such in the present unless more and better options (like WP or a better Moodle) start to break it down, or it implodes.  God, I hope it implodes....

> 
> Again--none of this is meant to be critical in the sense of stopping progress!  I'm just ecstatic to see the project getting rolling, and we should see it as opening up possibilities, rather than closing than down.

Same here!  If there's any criticism from me, it's only constructive.

Hey, glad to see so much interest in this idea, I can't reply to every
message but I'll try to summarize the main points that brought
arguments.

1. The WordPress/BuddyPress thingy
==================================
You must understand that it's not only the shortcodes problem.
BuddyPress brings a wrapper when it comes to grouping users, discussions
and data structuring. BuddyPress also is able to treat privacy aspects,
notifications control and per user preferences. With BuddyPress I can
make difference between who's a teacher and who's a student and show
control panels to one and another without messing all the data and
keeping the things clean. Be there a full LMS or a simple blog used to
publish some courses, BuddyPress can handle both, while building it on
WordPress we'll face constraints when it comes to growth and
scalability. So I would place use of BuddyPress as a must. To prove it
as a dependency I can create mockups and list you infinite possibilities
on how it can be extended [(c) jjj], but that's nothing when it comes to
data structuring and keeping things clean while handling a lot of user
generated content!
The last not the least, BuddyPress groups provide levels of privacy,
from public to hidden or moderated so its something a virtual school
must have.

2. Flexibility and modularity
=============================
I understand that every instance of learning tools you have/need will be
different, and I propose us to focus on some most common features such a
learning tool needs, make them work flawlessly and make them flexible in
options. I understand that a feature like tests/quizes creation tool
would be nice to have, but that's only a small part of our target users,
and I would propose us to focus on a more general tool where teachers
will be able to upload, list assignments and deliver them in a fast and
easy way to students. Making it a simple and easy to use tool, will
bring more interest than a complex and advanced tool that creates a lot
of magic but will be used in only 1/3 of the situations.

3. Gradebook
============
I'm afraid it's a must have and I would like some more opinions on
possible usages of it. So far I saw that some people are happy with its
features, others want something more complex. Also as Joseph mentioned,
things like rating forum posts isn't exactly what we should focus on.
My first idea was to offer a UI for a teacher inside an assignment
screen (or more general screen) to "grade the group users with marks".
CSV upload can be left as a backup solution, If we'll treat groups as
classes correctly, I think we won't deal with huge number of entries, so
creating a CSV and then uploading it will make less sense compared to
using a simple UI.

4. Notifications
================
The notification system from BuddyPress is our saviour. If in time a
developer will decide to write a SMS-delivery plugin for BuddyPress, we
will be able to use it with no problems. For courses, schedules and
grades notifications we can use private messaging or define our own
types of notifications and the end-user (student) will be able to simply
select what kind of notification he will receive (email, sms, rss).
Also there's already a plugin for group activity notifications.

5. User roles and mappings
==========================
LDAP/AD integration will be the second feature everyone will look for if
any of the discussed features will be implemented, and building from the
very beginning our tools with this in mind will save us a lot of time.
Kyle is right, messing with WP user roles is a bit complex, what about
using BuddyPress xprofile for that? :)
It's exactly what we need. Tag users just as Teacher/Student
and that's all. Make our plugin aware of that tags and we're saved.
So we can add LDAP integration and upon account creation, students and
teachers will get tagged. A SuperAdmin will also be able to change that
just by browsing users.

In short...
===========
Use BuddyPress because it will integrate perfectly the content and user
profiles. Keep it simple and let's target the main audience, not
specific problems. Make it flexible.

Don't worry, any criticism is welcomed. 



P.S.: Thanks a lot for sharing your experience and implementations. And
I'm happy to know that there are people ready to mentor/help me. Thanks
a lot.

It seems I'm the only person here who doesn't want a REQUIRED dependency 
on Buddypress so I will wish you all the very best of luck on your 
project while I continue to work on mine. It is too bad I won't be able 
to help with it.


@stas
There are normal wordpress functions for checking users so admins and 
students get different views. I've already done that in my script. Just 
use the current user can check. Assign students as subscribers, teachers 
as admin or editor depending on how much control you want to give.  
There is a wordpress codex page to show what abilities each level has.  
It wasn't very difficult.

@Joseph
Thank you for explaining how you use kbgradebook for showing feedback 
instead of actual grades/scores. Since I'm having my plugin create 
averages, I am keeping my score field for having percents (although I 
admit I'm not limiting it to 100), but I'm adding a varchar(200) field 
to my database table for teacher feedback.
"From the student's point of view, too, they can see the representation 
of their progress and the comments and feedback in a single word press 
page. "
good point!

@kyle
"
 From an admin perspective this is probably true.  BuddyPress tends to 
run slowly when pushed - at least on my shared hosting account even with 
W3cache enabled and WP-DBmanager doing some cleanup occasionally.

-------
my concern here is the REQUIREMENT of Buddypress to use a plugin for 
managing courses. It should be used for what it is a social plugin for 
interaction. Just because it is an automattic project, that doesn't mean 
it is stable or will be optimized. I'm pretty sure it isn't optimized at 
all. :-)  I have it running on one of my websites that has only a few 
users, but I don't dare try to launch a big course with many users with 
BuddyPress without a dedicated server. I've been testing BuddyPress on 
one of my websites and in the last few months I've had to redesign my 
blog theme twice due to the big changes they make every time it updates 
and the sitewide posts widget (which was awesome) complete broke with 
the 1.2 update. I wish they had warned us of that huge bug before 
upgrading *sigh*  Buddypress also does very strange things to page 
titles which I reported at least twice but I guess fixing functionality 
bugs is low priority right now.

"But logging into the site is de facto practice in my experience with 
Blackboard.  However, extending notifications beyond e-mail to RSS and 
maybe SMS would be a nice change.  I'm in agreement with you though, we

-------
wow, I really like the idea of using RSS for assignment/homework feeds, 
but I wonder how many people really understand how to use them. That was 
why I was thinking about e-mail. Even my parents know how to send an 
e-mail, but I doubt they have a clue about "new" technologies.   Being 
in Mexico where many people have limited access to the internet, I try 
to think about what they would know how to use and could quickly see and 
do from an internet cafe or from work during their lunch break (which is 
why I'm mostly focused on quizzes and automation)

Actually you can easily add new profile fields to regular plain old 
Wordpress with just a little code in your functions.php (in your theme 
directory).
here's a page where I learned how to do it. It is quite simple to make a 
list of fields with this method.
  http://yoast.com/user-contact-fields-wp29/
yes, that post describes adding new contact methods, but you could add 
fields for whatever you want and they will appear as profile options.

I wouldn't take it so seriously. I think your experience can be helpful,
and the fact that development will be done for BuddyPress, that doesn't
mean that the code can't be backported. 

Thanks a lot.

I've been making good progress on my Buddypress - optional - LMS plugin 
system and got my course info, syllabus, course sign up, and student 
management system working (only took two days!) and getting ready to 
start on a system for showing tasks in currently enrolled courses which 
I'd send to students by e-mail once a week and show when they go to a 
certain page when logged in.

I'd like to know what information and classification you'd find useful 
if I am able to later get these plugins ready to share in the next few 
months because honestly once it is all complete and working, I doubt 
I'll add any new fields or options.  It will all be clean up and details 
from then on.

Thank you

I can see your installation is pretty handcrafted for your personal
needs and its pretty cool to see you managed that. The main thing I'm
afraid of is that I'm from a different country and I'm almost 100% sure
the things are different over here compared to other countries, so if I
start some coding I will find very useful experience you already have in
both managing online courses/datas and tools for interacting with
students (gradebook, assignments and schedules).

For me, so far, is pretty clear the workflow and management of
informations using ScholarPress, but I believe there's space for
improvements (like already mentioned separation of courses from
schedules) and thats where your input will matter a lot.

Also I would like to see your code published and understand approaches
you used, lets say, for tasks/assignments.

I've been adding grades to a table as a percentage which could later be 
converted for grading scales when displayed. No one has mentioned any 
specific needs for gradebooks other than to be able to include feedback 
which I added before starting the course management plugin.

I really don't understand the separation of courses from schedules. 
There should always be some kind of schedule even if you don't require 
the student to follow one, it is still useful for the student to have a 
guide. The start date should be flexible unless the course needs to 
match the activities of an offline group.
   I'm going to try to set up this next plugin (very tempted to just add 
this feature to the course management one as a separate .php file or 
two)  to use the student's enrollment date (saved as YYYY-MM-DD ) as a 
basis for showing what to do since I personally don't see a need for a 
fixed start date for 100% online courses and probably set a variable in 
the script that  would skip the enrollment date check and use the date 
in the variable instead.  Hopefully using this method, I could set 
course info according to the need.
I do everything in php mostly using forms for the signup and "post" for 
sending the data through the processing scripts. As I said, I don't know 
javascript or ajax, but I saw there are some tutorials online now so I 
might try converting it later if I can get everything working right with 
just PHP & mysql.

I'm just using the functions included in plain old Wordpress for member 
lookup, manage students, to show different info to students and 
teachers, or have custom profiles. I'm also experimenting with creating 
"dashboard widgets" for students. Right now each plugin just shows a 
dashboard widget with a link to the important page one for checking 
their grades and one for seeing which courses they are enrolled in. I'm 
not showing that info directly because I don't want to have all those 
extra queries on a shared host every time they log in.

This is probably the most complicated part since I can do it so many 
ways. I've spent the last couple hours trying to decide if I want to 
create a task/assignment table for each course or one table with all of 
them with a course id field.  I guess I'll see what happens.  I won't be 
posting any complete scripts until I add them to the plugin directory or 
perhaps get help to fund my efforts since I do have to spend some time 
on other activities to make enough money to eat and pay the rent.  
Setting this up is just for fun and practice until I get some complete 
courses set up and even then there is no guarantee.
Once I get this third plugin working I'll send the list info for how to 
register/login and signup for a course to get feedback. How I set up 
this plugin might cause me to rethink parts of the first two.

My approach this week has been to keep it simple and flexible using what 
I know how to do to get it up and working even if not tidy or following 
plugin recommendations.  I've been spending time brainstorming and 
writing down steps I think would be needed to do a task then I try to 
code it. If it doesn't work I try another way.  I've been writing quite 
a few functions even though I normally use more include files. Right now 
I have several sheets of paper with my ideas for this next part working 
on a flow chart for the assignment/task/activity page and email 
notification and how they will interact with the enrollment table and 
course activity table where I'll store each activity... *sigh*

Yep that helped me understand your approach.
The idea of courses and schedules separation...
Suppose you got several teachers that will manage some classes, so
offering an option first to define a course and then just use it (drop
down list or drag'n'drop) when creating a schedule should save time. Its
pretty much like creating posts and categories, except the categories
are those with dates and location infos and posts are just content. So
making modifications in schedules with courses being apart, will allow
easier changes and will bring dynamic results.

About the assignments... Just an idea... I would implement them same way
you did with gradebook (if the tables got relationships), link table
IDs.

Thanks.

Hey Christopher-

I just wanted to say thank you for your continued work on this.  I've got a lot of free time coming up starting next week so maybe I can start to draft ideas regarding information, classification, and some further structure if this will help you out.

Additionally, I'd love to be a bug tester for you offline and privately if you need any help with that.

Many thanks for your hard work,

~kyle~

p.s. should we change the subjet from "GSoc..." to something a bit more relevant to your purposes?

Please sign me up for bug-testing.  I love this idea and hope, wish, pray
for a robust BP LMS plugin.  Our school currently uses ANGEL (recently
merged with Blackboard), and we're evaluating next steps, or as our
committee is called: "Life after ANGEL".  I got excited when I first saw
CourseWare for WP, but after installing quickly realized it was not what I
needed.  I'm going to try and get back to this list and read through all of
the threads, because I'm sure I'm missing the larger context of this
proposal, and will be glad to provide more input.

One idea...it would be awesome if you could somehow include a BP/LMS to
Google Wave extension?  I know this is all the hype in higher-ed ;)

I think that can be easily plugged by a third-party plugin like
buddypress-facebook. I also think its just a matter of time how fast it
gets written :)

Hello,
because WordPress vs. BuddyPress raised some discussions about
performance issues and resource usage, I asked about that and received
some positive replies.

Most interesting is this webpage where a couple of options are
described. Some of them are included or pluggable.

Just a quick update on my project (since we have the difference in 
opinion regarding requirements)

I've been without internet at home for the last week. I have a bad ISP 
and I've been trying to switch to another for months so  I haven't made 
much progress on it.  I do all my testing on my webhosting account since 
we only have one working computer here.  Before that I had just finished 
getting weekly e-mail updates for students based on syllabus info and 
the student's start date.  For example if the syllabus says that on day 
5 the student should read a page and take a quiz, the (text) email for 
that week will tell them to do that.

At this time, I'm thinking about how to set up a point/motivational 
system separate from grades for example a point for every activity 
completed.

I'm also focused on learning how to add other activities to the 
gradebook (not just quizzes and tests) so I guess I need to start 
learning AJAX so this might take forever. I know how to send scores from 
PHP scripts, but most games are in javascript so this is where I'm 
stuck. There isn't much point in getting bug testers and feedback until 
I have more activity types integrated.

Specifically I've been thinking about the HotPotatoes activities which 
are javascript. HotPotatoes is now free to use. Of course if any of you 
know of any PHP based games that are scored and free to use, please let 
me know. :-)

If you look at the info provided, those ideas are for Wordpress. They 
don't specifically make Buddypress less intensive or make fewer queries 
so I'm not yet convinced that requiring Buddypress is good since not 
everyone can afford a dedicated server (I know I can't!).  :-)

A bit offtopic maybe,
but I would suggest taking a look at jQuery and it's .ajax() method.
It's not that rocket science like it seems, and jQuery makes it even
easier to use.
api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

Btw, good to hear news from your project :)
Keep it up!

You might be right, unfortunately I didn't get a chance to benchmark a
heavy WordPress vs BuddyPress install, but hey, I trust the guys behind
the project and I'm sure they do their best :)

I was looking at that page, but it isn't very clear to me how to use it 
since I come from  PHP not javascript.

I suppose I'd include some jquery file in the page head and I saw the 
example:

|$.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: "some.php",
    data: "name=John&location=Boston",
    success: function(msg){
      alert( "Data Saved: " + msg );
    }
  });|||

||I really don't know how to integrate that in a game to send the score, 
name of the game, and the user's ID or email address over. I suppose if 
that were PHP I'd understand, but it isn't. :-)
I'd like to have a simple form included for the student to add their id 
and email and when they click a button it would send the info including 
the score. Yes, I could do a normal HTML form and have it "post" to my  
PHP page, but again I don't know how to get the score from javascript to 
go with it so it doesn't really make a difference. Without having the 
score, I could only report it as a completed activity.

Hi everyone,
I'm happy to announce that my idea got accepted for this summer of
coding, and hopefully soon, mentored by Jeremy Boggs and Boone Gorges,
BuddyPress will offer teaching tools for everyone.

I will come with more updates when our schedule and milestones are
defined. Thank you all for supporting this idea.

Subject: [wp-edu] Creation of Tables in WP via WP-Table-Reloaded

 

Loren,

 

Thanks for the suggestion to try WP-Table-Reloaded, but I had seen that one
previously and opted not to try it.   

I saw that this plugin is pretty popular and so thought it  might work for
me.   However.. not didn't seem to be optimal for what I had in mind (though
I could be wrong).

 

Here's my reasoning:   It seems to suggest that it stores each "table" that
you create ( I guess for re-use purposes) and then you reference that table
in your post/page using a special shortcode.   

Am I correct in this?    If so, that might work for some situations, but I'm
thinking that most times you'd want the actual content in the table to be
stored in the actual post/page and not simply hitting a reference to where
it's stored somewhere else.   What if someone removes the actual table data
in the "plugin" backend - or deinstalled the plugin (or it stops working due
to a upgrade or the plugin dev. Stops.)

 

What I'm pursuing is simply a way to generate the html needed for formatting
in the front-end editor - thus, even if the editor plugin I use to do this
function "goes away", breaks, or I deinstall it, the content in the
page/post is not dependent on it - since it's just standard HTML.     

 

Thanks,

 

Dave

Subject: [wp-edu] Creation of Tables in WP via WP-Table-Reloaded

=20

Loren,

=20

Thanks for the suggestion to try WP-Table-Reloaded, but I had seen that
one previously and opted not to try it.  =20

I saw that this plugin is pretty popular and so thought it  might work
for me.   However...... not didn't seem to be optimal for what I had in
mind (though I could be wrong).

=20

Here's my reasoning:   It seems to suggest that it stores each "table"
that you create ( I guess for re-use purposes) and then you reference
that table in your post/page using a special shortcode.  =20

Am I correct in this?    If so, that might work for some situations, but
I'm thinking that most times you'd want the actual content in the table
to be stored in the actual post/page and not simply hitting a reference
to where it's stored somewhere else.   What if someone removes the
actual table data in the "plugin" backend - or deinstalled the plugin
(or it stops working due to a upgrade or the plugin dev. Stops...)

=20

What I'm pursuing is simply a way to generate the html needed for
formatting in the front-end editor - thus, even if the editor plugin I
use to do this function "goes away", breaks, or I deinstall it, the
content in the page/post is not dependent on it - since it's just
standard HTML.    =20

=20

Thanks,

=20

Dave
