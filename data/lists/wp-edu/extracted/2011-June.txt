Hi all,

Thought you'd be interested to know that we finally deployed a refresh of
our website using WordPress (multisite) as the main CMS after almost a year
of development and testing: http://www.esm.rochester.edu
We're still working out some kinks and porting content over from the old
site, but I'm feeling pretty good about how it's working and everybody's
been loving the ease of creating and editing content.

A little more about the refresh (no real technical WP-related details,
though): http://www.esm.rochester.edu/esmtmp/web/about/

I'd appreciate any thoughts you might have, and I hope you're all staying
cool.
Helen

Subject: [wp-edu] Overwrite Default Add User Plugin
Message-ID: <AE8BE2E24729AE45A3B4448BAEA69900151FE1CF@ITS-MSXMBS3M.ad.unc.edu>

At UNC-CH we use shibboleth for all our user authentication.  We wanted to make it easy for faculty/staff/students to add other users in our environment so we wrote a small plugin that does the following:


  *   Allows people to be added just by their Shibboleth ID
  *   Allows multiple people to be added at once.
  *   Disables the need to confirm before adding a user.
  *   Allows each site administrator to send a welcome email if wanted and customize that welcome email with shortcodes.

You can read more here and download the code if you want to modify it for your environment.  http://dev.web.unc.edu/2011/06/13/new-unc-user-plugin/

Cheers,

~Jeff
