Here at Darden Business School we have our faculty blogs: http://blogs.darden.virginia.edu/ .  Overtime some plugins that were once used are no longer used.  We have a staging environment that is copy of our production environment.  In our staging environment we want to run a process like

1)      Identify plugin to remove

2)      Run a test (like a selenium test) against all blogs

3)      Remove said pluging

4)      Run test again

5)      If nothing broke, the add it to the list of plugins that can be removed from production.

How have any of you all done this?

This is a fantastic plugin:

Will list the sites that use each plugin you have installed.

Hello,

Can anyone make a recommendation on a discussion board plugin to use in a WP site? This is a multi-site instance and I'd like individual site admins to be able to place the discussion board on any page within their site.

Thanks,

David

SimplePress provides the ability to place a full-blown discussion forum on
a page. Other than the usual forum capabilities, one thing it can do is
make a post into a Forum topic automatically with a check of a checkbox in
the post.

If the degree of exchange is relatively light, you could just use the
built-in Discussion threads that can be made available on a post by post
basis.

We have had fantastic success with Simple:Press. It is extremely feature-rich, so initial configuration can be challenging, but for the end-user or even for the site admin once it is set up it is completely friendly and effective.

It is absolutely the best discussion board platform I have ever seen, far better than even dedicated forum software packages like phpBB, vBulletin or XenForo.

Highly recommended. The plugin is free although support requires a paid membership (well worth it, the developers are responsive and helpful)

Hey there,

This plugin is really simple to use and works perfectly on large multisite
networks. No configuration or headaches :)

http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/forums/

It is well overdue for some new features and updates - though it may meet
your needs. There should be quite a few new features and improvements in
the next month or so. These new features are a direct result of feedback
from the hundreds of universities and schools we work with.


Thanks!

We use bbPress here at UNC.  It is a bit strange to get going, but works great.  We just configured a theme and folks create a forum site and use that rather than embed it on a site. 

Drawbacks are that you can not easily embed a forum on any page.  It has it's own hierarchy because of the way it is built.  But very nice and lots of goodies to go along with it.

Keep in mind that you may need to pay a monthly membership fee to WPMU to have access to their plugins ($19/mo.)  ? even if you only want one of them. You can stop membership anytime, but you may miss out on updates and support if you do. I have had a somewhat adversarial position to their pricing model and have chosen to buy competitor's products that were sufficient, even though I would have preferred not to.

On the other hand, you may prefer to pay the monthly fee to gain the advantage of all of the support resources if you need them, as well as having access to all the other plugins they provide that comes with membership. It depends on your needs.

It's not a bad thing ? but just be informed before you consider the problem solved with a WPMU plugin.

Thx ? Steve

Our more manual process for blogs.brynmawr.edu goes something like: 
1) identify plugin to remove 
2) check in WP database which blogs have the plugin activated 
3) determine if plugin was actually used on those blogs (we have had some users who will just activate all available plugins to see what they do), and if so, how it affects the blogs/if it can be extricated 
4) If it seems reasonable to remove, remove plugin on test server 
5) See if the blog(s) are broken 
6) if not, remove in production 


For plugin or theme removals that affect large numbers of blogs, we do the same thing we do for upgrades to spot check for problems-- review blogs on a list of high priority (college news, blogs used for classes, etc) blogs, and those that are typical examples of use of all remaining themes and plugins. If none of those are broken, we're probably okay. This method has gotten us through a lot of cleanup and a couple of upgrades successfully. 


I thought I'd share this in case others aren't set up for automated testing. 


FYI: Catherine Farman and I talked more about cleaning up and maintaining a large multisite install, and consolidating/revising homegrown themes and plugins, at edUi and WordCamp last year-- the slides are here if anyone is interested: http://2012.philly.wordcamp.org/2012/10/27/slides-presentations/ (and I believe the WordCamp talk is on wordpress.tv ).

Here at Darden Business School we have our faculty blogs: http://blogs.darden.virginia.edu/ . Overtime some plugins that were once used are no longer used. We have a staging environment that is copy of our production environment. In our staging environment we want to run a process like 

1) Identify plugin to remove 

2) Run a test (like a selenium test) against all blogs 

3) Remove said pluging 

4) Run test again 

5) If nothing broke, the add it to the list of plugins that can be removed from production. 

How have any of you all done this?

Hey All, 

The wpmu-plugin-stats works great up to about 2000 sites and then it starts timing out because of the way it was built. :(  

Internally we have built our own plugin (which we will release on wordpress.org when we get it totally finished).  We're calling it the "Network Manager" plugin.  It takes between 30 seconds and 2 minutes to pull up stats for all 4500 of our sites on our network.  What is really nice though is that it has some nice javascript that allows you to search by plugin/theme and have the list instantly sort.  You network activate it and then it shows up under Sites - Network Information.  

I can send you a copy with the caveat that it is not done.  We are planning on adding a Contact form to email admins of a specific theme or plugin, add some statistical reporting pages, and some admin message functions that will show dashboard. messages on sites that use said plugin/theme.  

But even as is it has allowed us to start retiring plugins on our network for newer ones, retiring old themes, etc.  

Let me know if you'd like a copy and I'll send it to you.

Keep in mind that you may need to pay a monthly membership fee to WPMU to have access to their plugins ($19/mo.)  ? even if you only want one of them. You can stop membership anytime, but you may miss out on updates and support if you do. I have had a somewhat adversarial position to their pricing model and have chosen to buy competitor's products that were sufficient, even though I would have preferred not to.

On the other hand, you may prefer to pay the monthly fee to gain the advantage of all of the support resources if you need them, as well as having access to all the other plugins they provide that comes with membership. It depends on your needs.

It's not a bad thing ? but just be informed before you consider the problem solved with a WPMU plugin.

Thx ? Steve

Subject: Re: [wp-edu] Discussion board plugin

Hey there,

This plugin is really simple to use and works perfectly on large multisite networks. No configuration or headaches :)

http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/forums/

It is well overdue for some new features and updates - though it may meet your needs. There should be quite a few new features and improvements in the next month or so. These new features are a direct result of feedback from the hundreds of universities and schools we work with.


Thanks!

Highly recommended. The plugin is free although support requires a paid membership (well worth it, the developers are responsive and helpful)

I'm fortunate to be able to collaborate with our web sysadmin (Andrew Lacey) on WordPress cleanup projects. He said the following: 

"There isn't one single query that will do it. You need to run this query for each blog: 

select option_value from wp_#_options where option_name = "active_plugins" 

where # is the blog ID. I do this with a loop in a perl script (pull all the blog IDs first with a separate query, then loop through them). The resulting output contains all the plugins that are used by all blogs. You can then grep this for a particular plugin to see if anyone is using it." 


So obviously, a plugin that provides stats would be an easier option for those who don't have somebody in house who's comfortable with queries and scripts... If you have further questions, I'm happy to relay them to Andrew or put you in contact with him. 


Best, 
Juliana

5) See if the blog(s) are broken 
6) if not, remove in production 


For plugin or theme removals that affect large numbers of blogs, we do the same thing we do for upgrades to spot check for problems-- review blogs on a list of high priority (college news, blogs used for classes, etc) blogs, and those that are typical examples of use of all remaining themes and plugins. If none of those are broken, we're probably okay. This method has gotten us through a lot of cleanup and a couple of upgrades successfully. 


I thought I'd share this in case others aren't set up for automated testing. 


FYI: Catherine Farman and I talked more about cleaning up and maintaining a large multisite install, and consolidating/revising homegrown themes and plugins, at edUi and WordCamp last year-- the slides are here if anyone is interested: http://2012.philly.wordcamp.org/2012/10/27/slides-presentations/ (and I believe the WordCamp talk is on wordpress.tv ). 


Best, 
Juliana Perry

Here at Darden Business School we have our faculty blogs: http://blogs.darden.virginia.edu/ . Overtime some plugins that were once used are no longer used. We have a staging environment that is copy of our production environment. In our staging environment we want to run a process like 

1) Identify plugin to remove 

2) Run a test (like a selenium test) against all blogs 

3) Remove said pluging 

4) Run test again 

5) If nothing broke, the add it to the list of plugins that can be removed from production. 

How have any of you all done this?

I'm not sure whether this performs any better than WPMU's plugin on large installations, but I've been using Network Plugin Auditor to clean out old junk:

Everyone,

We're looking to CAS-ify our WordPress Multisite instances, having already CAS-fied Zimbra Webmail and Drupal.  Our research has led us to the wpCAS plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpcas/) but it hasn't been updated in the repo in two years.

Has anyone CAS-fied their WordPress Multisite instances, and if so, what do you use?

Ken,

I can't offer an answer to your question, but as the author of wpCAS, I would like to invite somebody in the community to take ownership of the plugin.

My understanding is that the plugin is still in use, but I've left higher ed and, as you've pointed out, just haven't been involved enough to update it (or even know what, if any, aspects of it need updating).

Contact me on or off list if you're interested in maintaining the plugin. Of course, its GPL, so anybody can take to code and release a fork, all I'm offering is control over that named plugin in the repo.

Hi Ken, we are in a process of making our wordpress MS  installation (wp3.5.1), CAS-ified.

We use a plugin which  needs phpCAS to work like wpCAS does.
 I'm not sure if we use the wpCAS, cause we have  'hacked' a lot into it, in order to make it:
->  use SAML VERSION 1.1,
->  fetch specific attributes and update the usermeta based on that
->  support single sign out
->  allow also other types of login (not fully tested)

Also our previous login mechanism was LDAP Authentication Plug-in  (http://wpmuldap.tuxdocs.net) so we had to keep the  wp_usermeta field names the same as LDAP Authentication Plug-in.
It is still in a development phase, with no admin page, just a config file, but if you are interested, we can upload it somewhere or send it by a private message to you. 
Of course we don't suggest to use it, without heavy testing in your production installation.

Bests regards
Lena

Hello all,

I have not delved to deeply into the use of the custom field functionality of WordPress but I'm looking at a use case that will do the following:

1. Each post would have custom fields defined.

2. The name and value of these custom fields would automatically be displayed in the post content when viewed on the site.

3. A page would show the index of values for a particular custom field to allow users to access posts by that value.

Has anyone done this? Any plugins you can recommend?

David

It's pretty straightforward. You might look at:

Advanced Custom Fields:
http://www.advancedcustomfields.com

or, if you want to customize the look and feel of the back-end, this
might be useful. I've used it on several projects:

Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress

Since I'm not a programmer, I have tried just about every plugin (and combination of plugins) to support the management and presentation of custom post types, taxonomies, and fields ? just do a search through the forums for my name and custom post types ? and, at least for the moment, I've found that WP-Types & Views has met my needs. 

	<http://wp-types.com/>

Always interested in the observations of this august body. Also, here's some detail in how we used it on a project last year.

Subject: [wp-edu] Use of custom fields.
In-Reply-To: <85F05EE0D1E7E1499CCFFE9E3DFDF43C08B206D9@SSVMEXDAG01MB03.tufts.ad.tufts.edu>

Custom fields are intended to extend the kinds of data that can be
associated with a particular post beyond the "stock" data input in a
typical post.

There are two halves to the process: creating the custom field, and
displaying it.

IMO, I have had the best experience using the Easy Content Types plugin by
Pippin http://pippinsplugins.com/easy-content-types/

The outcome of using this plugin will be a dedicated post type that
appears in your dashboard admin with its own data fields according to
whatever criteria you establish. The metabox feature gives a wide variety
of data types you can integrate into your custom post type.

With a CPT, a set of taxonomies, and a slew of metaboxes, you can then
modify your post templates to display whatever data you want, based on the
custom fields slugs that are automatically created when you create your
CPT.

Each taxonomy you create in this process will also appear in your
Appearance/Menu area so you can build navigation based on the taxonomies
your create. You will have to create a template, however, that corresponds
to this query. The plugin provides ample documentation on how to do this.

The description above is intended for creating a set of posts that are
distinct from the stock post type your get out of the WordPress box. If
you are looking to simply add custom fields to the existing post system,
this plugin would help establish the custom fields, but it might be
overkill.

Please remember, too, that custom fields will not appear in your dropdown
menus as available until at least one post has been published that uses
that custom field (kinda like the way Categories don't appear in menus
unless there's a post in one).

I have also used a variety of plugins for this.  If I'm going to use a plugin I really like Types, and Wp-views (premium plugins) is very powerful.  We have had some issues with embedded types (taking the type out of the plugin and embedding it in a theme), but over all it's a +1 for types for me right now.  

That being said, it always makes me uneasy when we have to do updates to the the plugin if it will continue to work.  Building it straight in the theme is always better for that, but metaboxes are kind of a pain in code, especially compared to how easy custom fields are with types.

I just bought Types, and Views - the whole package. Then I found PODs.  PODs is/has been sponsored by Automattic.  And it has a lot of bite for a Free plugin - it can handle things which Types can't like a taxonomy relationship to another taxonomy. Many people use it with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). But this isn't completely necessary.  I haven't come to the point yet where I think my purchase of Types and Views was not worth it, but If I had found PODs a week earlier I would not have bought it.

That's great to know, Hugh.

I was following PODS through the very long transition to a new version/rewrite last year, and couldn't wait any longer. Worth revisiting!
