Subject: [wp-edu] LDAP account synchronization/Permissions for users that
 don't yet exist
Message-ID: <7AE330FE-19B9-4265-BAEC-41F2E5C7EC55@tufts.edu>

Hello all,

We currently use LDAP for authentication to our WordPress multi-site installation, and user accounts are created when the user first logs in.  However, we often need to be able to add users to a site before they?ve logged in.  We have been doing this via a separate custom portal that creates the user accounts ?as needed?, but we?re trying to retire that tool and break that dependency.

Does anyone do any sort of account synchronization with a directory (LDAP or AD)?   If not, how do/would you handle granting users access before they?ve logged in?


Thanks,

I'd love to hear if anyone else has solved this problem, too. In my
opinion, Wordpress continues to suffer from its single-user heritage and as
a result tends to lack a lot of the "glue" that's necessary to do
multi-user at scale, and that problem tends to crop up often in higher-ed
environments. I've configured Wordpress to use both LDAP and Shibboleth and
none of the available plugins do exactly what we need all the time, so
we've had to use a combination of custom hacks and user education ("Make
sure the user you want to add as an author on your blog has logged in at
least once before you try to add them") to work around these issues. If
Wordpress had a comprehensive web service API of some sort this would be a
pretty straightforward thing to do, but since it still doesn't, we're stuck
with various hacks and workarounds.

On a related note, last I looked there weren't any decent LDAP plugins
left. The ones I found were either unmaintained or didn't provide the
functionality I needed (which really isn't very complicated - authenticate,
and use a few LDAP attributes to populate user data such as name,
basically). If anyone has any suggestions for something I might have
missed, I'd love to hear about it.

Hey folks,

I'm working WP SAML Auth <https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-saml-auth/> on
behalf of Pantheon to solve exactly this problem. While it's still early
days, the plugin is functional and I'd love to hear your feedback on it.
Happy to take questions in Github issues, or schedule a demo Hangout

Cheers,

Daniel

Hi Ian,

Here at Williams we use the LDAP authentication plugin found here:

http://wpmuldap.tuxdocs.net

It allows us to create users prior to login and even allows bulk user
creation. It was added to our site before I arrived here, so I don't know
whether we needed to customize it at all. Also, looks like public version
hasn't been updated in a few years.

Regards,
Carl

A plugin like that sounds great in terms of functionality, but the fact
that it hasn't been updated since 2012 makes it a non-starter for us,
unfortunately.

We?ve used wpmuldap at Lafayette for years and while its deprecation gives us pause it hasn?t broken (yet). We?ve made very few customizations to it.

Well, here?s another olden one: We use
WPMU Ldap Authentication
It works great.
Maybe there just isn?t a lot of running changes to LDAP-integrations?
And I?m guessing a lot of institutions using LDAP will be running servers etc are run behind their usual firewalls & security?
