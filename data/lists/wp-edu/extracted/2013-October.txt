Subject: [wp-edu] For those who host WordPress sites for others...a question
 on how to let a site owner update plugins

Greetings fellow WordPress users,

Background:
I work in an IT department that provides WordPress hosting and support for three academic departments. Our users are mostly faculty and grad students, and the sites focus on their research labs. 

We maintain a WP multisite with about 55 sites. As the multisite sysadmin, I manage the themes, plugins and WP core files. I also create child themes and write plugins.

Most of our sites are very simple and require little content maintenance (very few blog). One lab group, however, wanted social media plugins that did not play well with the multisite. I moved them to a separate Linux VM running Apache with a single WordPress installation. 

The lab owner (a faculty member) wants to be able to install and configure plugins on his own so he can play with Twitter plugins. He is currently admin on the site.

Technical Implementation Question
Is it possible to give a site admin on a single WP installation the ability to install, update, and configure plugins, but not delete them or touch core? 

I talked with our Linux sysadmin, and we have thought of 3 possible ways to do this:
1) By plugin
2) Through the VM, by creating a Linux user account then letting him enter than information in the WP connection screen
3) (worst case) Give him SSH access to the plugins folder on the VM and let him use a tool like WinSCP to upload the files

Re #2, the posts I found in the WP Codex led me to believe that the user account entered into the WP connection screen must be in the www-data group or root group. That is a higher security priv that our Linux sysadmin prefers to give him.

Thank you in advance for any guidance you can provide.

Sincerely,
Dixie Lang

A user with the ability to install and update plugins will always have the
ability to delete them. There's no way on an operating-system level of
distinguishing between those two actions (in Linux that's write-level
access). If they're on their own VM with just a single Wordpress install
just give them admin access to that install. They don't need to be root on
the box, they just need the same account that owns the Wordpress files.
Your sysadmin can setup an account for them, chown the folders and files
for the Wordpress install, and then give them those credentials and it
should work.

Hi,

You may want to look into building an infrastructure where site owners and
developers can work on a development instance.
Having a dev instance is helpful, as it gives site owners and developers a
safe place for enhancing and testing their sites without breaking the
production instance.
Once the desired change is made, the dev instance can be promoted to a
staging instance via a sync script  where site owners/developers can review
to ensure that nothing is broken.  If all looks good in the staging
instance, the site can be promoted to production.

I hope this helps.
Best-
Alba

Event: Earn your Angel Wings & Create Lasting Memories This Xmas
Date: Wednesday, October 30, 2013 from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM (PDT)
Location: &lt;b&gt;St Andrews The Terrace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Terrace&lt;br /&gt;Wellington, 6011&lt;br /&gt;New Zealand&lt;br /&gt;

------------------------------
Event Details:
------------------------------

Dear undercover angel,
As the season of goodwill approaches you are probably inspired to remind the special people in your life that they matter. You want to let them know how special they really are to you.
?
For example, we all love our Mum and want her to know she is appreciated. We all want to let her know that every last one of her acts of love, has been remembered.???
?
?? What if you were to write to her telling her about all of those things that mean so much to you. All of those memories. What if those events were recorded for future generations to treasure. All of those special days and the times you shared together, blended with pictures and images that you know are special to her. And to you as well.
?
Imagine the look on Mums face on Christmas morning as she unwraps her present. Think about how thrilled she will be to discover the book you wrote.? Just for her. All about her.
?
Now imagine how good you will feel as well. Knowing you've achieved what most other people often talk about but never get round to.
?
And it's a little bit like achieving immortality because once your book is published it exists forever.
?
Now you may be thinking you can't write and publish a book between now and Xmas. In fact you may be thinking you can't write and publish a book at all.
?
Perhaps it's something you have thought about but still feel clueless.
?
I say you can.

Not only that I say you can write and publish a book easily. You will learn a proven simple system for writing and publishing your book that has been tested by over a million people, just like you. Most of them had never written a book before, either.

In fact, if you can write an email you can do this. We'll show you the simple, technology we use to do this.

You see, we are using a tested formula that you can tailor exactly, to tell the story that you want to tell, about your Mum... or your Dad, your sister or brother, a friend or a spouse, a teacher or mentor.

To honour a colleague or team member; a milestone or an achievement; a significant breakthrough; a triumph or a victory? or anything else that deserves recognition.

To mark a passing. To remember an iconic person in your life.

For anyone and everyone else you want to appreciate, this festive season. Or any other time of the year as well.

?? Join #1 International Best selling author and book writing authority, Mike Noone as he leads you step by step, through the proven recipe for writing the perfect gift that will last forever in your Mum's heart.It's simpler than cooking a Christmas pudding.

This year, don't just give her a present. Give her a timeless heirloom.

?? Book early because this hands on workshop will fill up fast. I am strictly limiting the number of places to just 20, so that you get the attention you need to learn how to do this, easily.

We chose St Andrews on the Terrace as our venue because it is at the heart of Wellington with easy access by buses, trains and road. We priced the workshop so that you can save a fortune over the years using our secret recipe.

How many landmark events happen every year in your life and in the lives of everyone you know ? Think about that.

Now it's time for you to fly...

Make, Mum's day. (Or anybody else's...)

Reserve your place now by clicking on the Paypal button.

Warm regards,
Mike Noone
?
PS: Once you know this formula you can use it again and again, year after year. From here to eternity.

PPS: This formula is also precision designed for marking other celebrations such as birthdays, weddings, christenings and engagements.? The possibilities are endless...

Hi everyone,

I'm having trouble with the metadata on one of my subsites ? when I paste a
link into Facebook, I don't get a photo preview or excerpt. All I get is a
boring link preview. The subsite is wagner.edu/hawktalk. Other subsites
pull the appropriate previews. Any ideas for what I'm missing?

You can use the Facebook Linter tool to "reset" what FB knows about
the page. It basically clears FB's cache of the page.

I put your page in here and tested and I now get an image to show up
when I share the link. I used this URL (with trailing slash):
http://wagner.edu/hawktalk/

https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwagner.edu%2Fhawktalk%2F

Also, your og:image is commented out. You can use this to control
which image it uses.

<!--<meta property="og:image" content="http://www.myimage.jpg"/>-->

Thanks, Bill. I guess the homepage of the blog works, but when I paste an
individual post (for example, http://wagner.edu/hawktalk/archives/3316)
into FB, I just get the link. When I use that FB tool (
https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwagner.edu%2Fhawktalk%2Farchives%2F3316),
it says that the "URL returned a bad HTTP response code" and that "the
og:type property" is missing.  How do I fix that on my site? Is this
somehow related to the way permalinks are set up on the blog?

Hi Anna,

It does appear that the issue is related to your permalink structure. As
you can see in the Facebook debugger, it shows a 301 redirect from
http://wagner.edu/hawktalk/archives/3316 to
http://wagner.edu/hawktalk/archives.

Another great tool:

http://redbot.org/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwagner.edu%2Fhawktalk%2Farchives%2F3316

As Ben said, your server is returning a 301 redirect for that URL.

I'm not sure why a regular browser would ignore the redirect, though.
