Hi fellow Wordpress multisite users

We have been using Wordpress multisite with our School of Journalism class sites for the past five years. It seems that we have finally lost the battle with plugins and updates. Security is breached, unexplained traffic is taking down the servers and nothing is reliable. The competent people who did the original install are long gone. 

Have any of you faced similar problems with an old WPMS network? Do you have an outside host that keeps things running smoothly? Have you changed to a new system?

Thanks for your feedback.

Best,

Darcy

So sorry to hear about this Darcy!

We?ve kept things up to date and secure for about seven years now, but I know you don?t want to hear that!

I have heard many very good reports about Sucuri https://sucuri.net/wordpress-security/wordpress-security-monitoring
both for ongoing monitoring and for cleanup once the problem is happening.

For hosting, I think (especially if you don?t have real support), the folks at Reclaim Hosting are going to be a lot better support and caretaking.

Sucuri is a great recommendation. I can also suggest both http://tri.be and http://10up.com as reputable agencies that can help with architecting (or re-architecting) for security and performance.

In a lot of cases we see traffic taking the form of brute force login
attempts both on wp-login.php and xmlrpc.php. Handling this at the plugin
level is harder than at the server level because any plugin is going to
have to load properties of WordPress and make database calls to read
anything about the user and IP-based blocking is often thwarted by a
distributed attack from many different IP addresses (so individual IPs
might only log in one time but the weight of all attempts across the range
will take down the server).

We've had good experience using Fail2ban on the server (
http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) in combination with the
WP-fail2ban plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fail2ban/) which
writes failed login attempts to the auth log. The plugin can deny at the
server level *any* attempt with username admin or administrator which alone
will cut down on 99% of attacks and beyond that can block network ranges
based on the failed attempts of multiple IPs within that range. It's a
really elegant and flexible solution in my opinion.

Hi Darcy,

There could be a bright side -- There is nothing like a painful security
failure to focus those that hold the purse strings on the benefits of
managed hosting. This might be an opportunity to switch to one of the
excellent managed hosting solutions that are now available for WordPress
multi-site installations. Pagely.com and WPEngine.com are the most well
know in this space in the US, and here in Canada I'm very partial to
WPCloud.ca.

Using managed hosting very effectively offloads most security, backup and
optimization issues onto the host. Since these are WP specialists with
their reputations on the line they do a very good job of handling it.

It goes against the DIY ethic of a lot of higher education institutions,
but it is a very effective way to get the job done.

Cheers,

Dan Bashaw

Hello, Darcy. While there may be benefits to having faculty, staff and students establish and manage a professional web presence via a single WP instance and self-branded domain, many IT dwellers like myself still find that the strength and voice of an online campus community grows, especially for digital newbies distraught with Google and Facebook, en masse with a well honed multisite instance. Still, keeping a vigilant eye on rogue themes and plugins is an ongoing challenge.  If self hosting is causing growing pains that stunt your outreach and service to others, I have to say that Reclaim Hosting does a fabulous job by and for academic ' edtech ' people minding the concerns you raise at a super reasonable cost to end users while on campus.. and after graduation.

Good luck on your migration.

In peace,
Ben

Hi Darcy,

There could be a bright side -- There is nothing like a painful security failure to focus those that hold the purse strings on the benefits of managed hosting. This might be an opportunity to switch to one of the excellent managed hosting solutions that are now available for WordPress multi-site installations. Pagely.com and WPEngine.com are the most well know in this space in the US, and here in Canada I'm very partial to WPCloud.ca.

Using managed hosting very effectively offloads most security, backup and optimization issues onto the host. Since these are WP specialists with their reputations on the line they do a very good job of handling it.

It goes against the DIY ethic of a lot of higher education institutions, but it is a very effective way to get the job done.

Cheers,

Dan Bashaw

Hello, Darcy. While there may be benefits to having faculty, staff and students establish and manage a professional web presence via a single WP instance and self-branded domain, many IT dwellers like myself still find that the strength and voice of an online campus community grows, especially for digital newbies distraught with Google and Facebook, en masse with a well honed multisite instance. Still, keeping a vigilant eye on rogue themes and plugins is an ongoing challenge.  If self hosting is causing growing pains that stunt your outreach and service to others, I have to say that Reclaim Hosting does a fabulous job by and for academic ' edtech ' people minding the concerns you raise at a super reasonable cost to end users while on campus.. and after graduation.

Good luck on your migration.

In peace,
Ben

Hi fellow Wordpress multisite users

We have been using Wordpress multisite with our School of Journalism class sites for the past five years. It seems that we have finally lost the battle with plugins and updates. Security is breached, unexplained traffic is taking down the servers and nothing is reliable. The competent people who did the original install are long gone.

Have any of you faced similar problems with an old WPMS network? Do you have an outside host that keeps things running smoothly? Have you changed to a new system?

Thanks for your feedback.

Best,

Darcy
