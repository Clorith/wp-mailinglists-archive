Subject: [wp-edu] Plugin for Creative Commons image search
Message-ID: <618913179437F14AB3A65275853EA3727267A71C@MAIL.cti.gr>

Hi all.
We in https://blogs.sch.gr (which is the multisite blogging service for greek schools, educators and students), inspired from the new creative commons search tool,  have built a similar WordPress plugin.
The plugin is called Easy search and use CC-licensed images for WP and allows the author to search and use CC-lisensed images via a pop-up window in WordPress editor.  This way the author doesn’t have to worry about the copyrights of an image he/she uses.
The plugin is multisite compatible and translation ready.

If you find the idea interesting you can find more in the WordPress repository plugin’s page: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ls-wp-ccsearch/
and in the blog post in opensource.creativecommons.org<https://opensource.creativecommons.org/blog/entries/2019-07-24-cc-search-wp-plugin/> about the inspiration and how it works.

Hello all,

Recent mandates and guidelines at our school have us taking a close look at how we can ensure sites created on our multi-site instance are meeting digital accessibility standards (keyboard access to all features of a site, accessible by screen readers etc.). Since we run our system as a self-service platform it’s going to be difficult to have all sites 100% accessible but we are looking at ways to mitigate issues.

I’d be interested to know how others are approaching this issue.

I’m going to assessing these three plugins:


https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/

https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility-helper/

https://wordpress.org/plugins/userway-accessibility-widget/
Are there others people can recommend?
Are there certain themes that are more accessible than others that you have tried?

Any thoughts/experiences/ideas you have would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,

David

We are on multi-site WordPress. We don't have a dedicated webmaster, but did carve some time out for one of our skilled staffers to work on re-tooling the school websites. 

Our approach has been: 

• Researching Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 requirements, attending every workshop available on the subject. 
• Standardizing on a theme that is inherently compliant as well as mobile-friendly (Monument Valley). It's important to note that no plugin is going to meet all the needs. 
• We do complement the above theme with the WP Accessibility plugin. 

It's slow progress to win over the stakeholders who need to get their website redone but we've been pleased with the results so far.

Hello David,
I am the web administrator at Georgian Court University<https://georgian.edu/>.

I just went through this, transforming our 800+ page non-accessible site. (3-month development time)
After a few months of research, multiple themes/plugins, etc., I went with the GeneratePress theme, using Elementor for our page builder.

Also, during development, I used the Google Chrome extension “Siteimprove Accessibility Checker”. (University’s need to be AA compliant)

Please let me know if you have any additional, more specific questions.
Rich

Hi David.

We also have a multisite. Our students request sites for their academic
classes. It is their responsibility (Terms of Use) to incorporate
accessibility features in their site content. They don't always do it, mind
you!

I looked at the WP Accessibility Plugin and didn't find it all that
helpful. It does offer some features that a site visitor could use to make
the site more accessible - changing the font size, "high contrast" mode,
skip-links. But, it doesn't really address making the site's content
accessible from the start.

When I teach WordPress workshops, I show users how to create accessible
content - text formatting using headers, descriptive hyperlinks, accessible
fonts, good contrast, alt text for images, captioning and transcripts, etc.
Below are some references and tools I use.

*References*

   - WebAIM <https://webaim.org/>
   - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/>
   (WCAG)
   - WordPress Accessibility Handbook
   <https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/>

*Accessibility Tools*

   - ChromeVox Screen Reader
   <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox-classic-extensi/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn>
   (Chrome extension)
   - Read & Write Gold
   <https://www.texthelp.com/en-us/products/read-write/read-write-for-google/>
   (Chrome extension)
   - NVDA <https://www.nvaccess.org/download/> (free downloadable screen
   reader)
   - YouTube Captions
   <https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en>
   - Online Transcript Creator <http://otranscribe.com/>
   - Google Doc Voice Typing
   <https://qz.com/work/1087765/how-to-transcribe-audio-fast-and-for-free-using-google-docs-voice-typing/>
   - Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool <https://wave.webaim.org/> (website
   accessibility checker)

*Simulations*

   - Funkify Disability Simulator <https://www.funkify.org/simulators/> (Chrome
   extension)
   - Web Disability Simulator by Metamatrix
   <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/web disability simulator>
   (Chrome extension)
   - Color Blindness Simulator
   <https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/>

As far as themes go, you can search in WordPress (
https://wordpress.org/themes/) > *Feature Filter *for "Accessibility Ready"
themes. For more information, see the WordPress Accessibility Handbook
<https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/which-themes-can-you-use/>.
This is probably WAY more information than you wanted, but I hope it is
helpful.

Best.
