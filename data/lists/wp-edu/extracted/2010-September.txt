I agree. We looked at the different role extenders but ultimately  
decided that the extra granularity wasn't worth the risk of a crucial  
plugin breaking network-wide during an upgrade. The only specific role  
tweak that's one our wish list is to allow Authors to create drafts of  
pages (which could then be published by Editors). Right now only  
Editors can draft and publish pages (which isn't in keeping with the  
Contributor -> Author progression, where contributors can create  
drafts of posts, but Authors can publish them; I'd love to see that  
progression replicated with Author -> Editor for pages).

Changing the functionality of a core role is not something we can really do,
even if that makes sense, for compatibility reasons.

It's actually a really simple plugin.  All you need to do is give Author the
edit_pages capability. Two ways to do it -- alter the role in the database,
or do a filter at runtime. No need to worry about plugin upgrades in that
case, or compatibility with changes to core.

This untested example modifies the roles definition in the DB:

class Nacin_Authors_Draft_Pages {
   function Nacin_Authors_Draft_Pages() {
      register_activation_hook( __FILE__, array( &$this, 'activate' ) );
      register_deactivation_hook( __FILE__, array( &$this, 'deactivate' ) );
   }
   function activate() {
      $role = &get_role( 'author' );
      $role->add_cap( 'edit_pages' );
   }
   function deactivate() {
      $role = &get_role( 'author' );
      $role->remove_cap( 'edit_pages' );
   }
}
new Nacin_Authors_Draft_Pages;

	WordPress MultiSite

Since the upgrade to WordPress 3.0 things have been running fairly  
smoothly, but I been seeing sporadic problems with some themes no  
longer displaying theme options for  web site administrators.  The  
three themes in question are Mandigo, Tarski and Viala and in all  
cases, the superadmins for the WordPress network are able to access  
these theme options. That's why this problem never showed up in our  
testing; we were logged in as network admins.

After doing some digging, I found the problem: a misunderstanding of  
the "edit_themes" capability.

Based on this discussion thread (http://wordpress.org/support/topic/capability-manage_options-vs-edit_themes 
) it seems that the "edit_themes" capability was intended to be given  
to site administrators who could actually edit the theme itself via  
Wordpress NOT to grant them access to theme options.  I haven't been  
using WordPress long enough to know if this capability has morphed  
over time, or if it was always like this, but in either case it's  
creating headaches now. :)

In a single site WordPress install using the "edit_themes" capability  
to control theme options access works just fine, because they're one  
in the same: the "site administrator" is also the same person who  
could edit the CSS or HTML of the template in question via the  
WordPress interface.

In WordPress 3.0 MultiSite however, that won't work.  You can't let  
individual site administrators edit the theme files because their  
changes would affect everything in the network. As a result, site  
administrators no longer have the "edit_themes" capability; only  
network superadmins can do that.  However themes like Mandigo, Tarski  
and Viala all depend on the "edit_themes" capability to display their  
theme options, and since site admins no longer have it, they can't get  
to their site options anymore.

I'm assuming this capability change happened as part of the code merge  
with WP 3.0 and WP 3.0 MU, since the theme options were still  
accessible under 2.9.

Based on Andrea_R's response to the thread, the fix is to change the  
logic so that it uses the "manage_options" capability (which site  
admins have) instead of "edit_themes".

Additional information -- Prior to 3.0, we used switch_themes to control the
Appearance submenus such as widgets. We introduced a new capability called
edit_theme_options, that way someone could edit these theme options (menus
included) without being able to necessarily switch the theme (or,
hypothetically, vice versa). You may wish to use that capability in lieu of
manage_options, though in your case it probably doesn't matter.

Thanks for the heads-up! By default, who gets access to the  
"edit_theme_options" capability -- is that a site administrator only  
or do editors have that as well?

Only administrators, same as switch_themes from which it derives.

Thanks -- that's handy! Though I see it mentions that the docs need to  
updated to include Multisite and superadmin, since the page isn't  
strictly accurate for a multisite install (as "edit_themes" gets  
bumped up to super admin).

Are there any other capabilities that were reserved for superadmin in  
WordPress 3.0 multisite mode that might be problematic?

WordCampEds (see http://wordcamped.org/).

I assume, though I?m not positive, that there will again be an Ed Track at

in. Please do propose something for the event if you can make it.  Either
way, should a distributed WordCampEd emerge I?d be happy to participate.

  Hi Jeff. There have been several in the last two years, with the first 
one being at George Mason (wordcamped.com). There have also been 
academic tracks at larger WordCamps (New York City), and SIGs put on 
through traditional academic conferences. WordCamps are meant to be in 
person face-to-face conferences, for building local communtiy, and we 
have not approved any virtual events using the WordCamp name before for 
this reason. That said, it's been awhile since there was an 
academic-only WC, and there are enough colleges and universities using 
WordPress that there would be more than enough interest for another one.

I'm interested in a WordPress Edu event as well.  Normally I'd want to  
attend the NYC Wordcamp event, but I'll have just returned from  
HighEdWeb in Cincinnati a few days before, which makes attending a non- 
starter.

I'd be up for a gathering of the Ed/WordPress minds either virtually  
or in-person.

Though, WordCamps have been inviting of educational folks already as  
Jane pointed out.  I was one of the ed folks who spoke at WordCamp  
Chicago and highly appreciated the experience.  That being said, I  
felt like my topic (BuddyPress as LMS) may not have been appreciated  
by that many folks in the audience since they were more looking for a  
general WordPress talk.

Definitely interested in a focused WordCamp. In-person would be nice, but
virtual works, too.

Glad to see there is plenty of interest in Edu focused WordCamps. In person or virtual is all good. It really doesn't matter if you remember to video / stream / archive presentations to http://wordcamp.tv or similar. Definitely does a great favor to those of us in education who have only faint memories of those things once called "travel and conference budgets"

I too would be excited by this, and virtual or in-person works well. I
actually like the idea of a focused space where people write up or present
what they are doing virtually, and we find a way to focus it as an ongoing,
updating resource online. Perhaps this will give us the occasion to work
towards such an event/publication we can all feature and be featured.

I'd be happy to initiate a simple WP site to continue this discussion and capture our knowledge in anticipation of a face-to-face confab. The caveat is that I'm not much of a developer or designer, but it could always evolve to something more sophisticated in future. Any objections?

I'm happy to lend the wordcamped.org domain for such purposes -- I've let it become stale over time.

I think this is all a great idea.  Let's start working on something on the
wordcamped.org site.  I can certainly do some development and get up a forum
or something where we can discuss topics/dates, etc.  I think it would have
been tremendously helpful to have something like that when I started out and
that seems like a great place for it!  Thanks for offering Dave.

I?d be willing to contribute some design/dev time to get a site going. I
think a part-discussion part-article WP higher ed/general edu resource would
be a great thing! Sort of branching off from the WordCamp idea, but they
could go hand-in-hand, especially for those of us who have only ever heard
rumors of travel/conference allowances :)

Are we envisioning a space that is primarily in support of a WordCamp, or one that will support WordPress users in education above and beyond conferences? (I'm aware of the desire to make sure the label "WordCamp" is reserved for that use.) Being clear up front could avoid issues down the road.

That's where I'm hung up a little bit as well, actually. I knew that the
idea of a resource beyond conferences would be stepping out of bounds, if
you will, so thank you for calling that out. I still love the idea of a
targeted WordCamp, but I know that for myself (and probably for a lot of us
working for educational institutions), the time/money/ability to travel to a
conference is very limited. Since there seems to be a lot of interest in
sharing information, why not start with a site and keep the goal of a
WordCamp in mind? Should we start a new e-mail thread to clarify?

Agreed.  A camp would be awesome, but the people who really ought to be
there (users and designers/developers alike) could have a difficult time
actually getting there.

WordPress is becoming more well known in Education, and if we got the word
out on a targeted site, it could become all the more popular.  Perhaps even
popular enough that all of the larger cities or college towns would want an
Education track.

I'd very much be willing to contribute posts and screencasts to a  
WordPress/Ed related site with or without a conference attached to it.
Giving up the "Wordcamped" domain would be sad as it fits nicely, but  
maybe something more like WordPressEd (wordpressed.org) would be  
appropriate (and legal)?

  Can't have "WordPress" in a top-level domain for trademark reasons.

I don?t think we?re supposed to use WordPress written out in the URL.
Something like wp-edu.org would be good, though. Too bad we can?t use
wp.edu!

If the site already exists out there, that's great.  I'd love to contribute.
 If not, can we use wp-edu.org?  It is available.  I'm just not sure we that
is okay.

I just took a look at <wp-edu.org> without the hyphen: <http://wpedu.org>. Using that domain, we'd have to be always repeating "hyphen" in conversation ;) Poor typists would wonder when we started doing auto-translation.

<http://dev.wpmued.org/> seems to have an established function and sounds as if it is focused on MU.

Also available (with neighbors):

wplearning.org (http://wplearning.com)
wplearn.net (http://wplearn.com, http://wplearn.org)

It?s true, saying ?double you pee dash ee dee you? is awkward, but I think
it might be the more appropriate option in that it doesn?t limit to MU or
WordPress as a learning tool (and also parallels this mailing list name
nicely!). I wonder if there would be a way to work with the great minds
behind WPMu Ed to migrate/mirror applicable content in a non-?deprecated
name space.?

For the record, there is no more MU. The multisite features are now part 
of core WordPress. Anyone still using MU should really upgrade to get 
the 3.0 CMS features.

I kind of like wp-edu.org.  I don't mind typing -'s. :)  I have never been a
fan of bleeding things together like we tend to do in web land.

I just took a look at the wpmued.org dev site and it is fantastic.  I like
the pulling posts in from separate blogs and I think that is a great start.
 The more I think about it, the more a wiki sounds like a good idea.  That
way we can have pages of suggested plugins, and pages for each plugin with
suggestions for getting help, etc.   That is going to be more useful for
those getting started than searching through blog posts.

I see you went ahead and bought wp-edu.org :) I think we could utilize
categories (or even, gasp, custom post types) to great effect ? creating a
showcase of education sites, walkthroughs of processes a la the UMW
WPMU-to-3.0 move, vetted plugins, etc. Encouraging active discussion
(whether separately in forums or in post comments or both) would also be
important.

While we're discussing these important topics of purpose and identity, I also wanted to bring up governance. From experience, I believe a little forethought goes a long way later on that ;)

The site we're discussing may eventually have real value -- collegial as well as financial -- and we probably want to avoid the challenges of split or unclear ownership. (I can think of a CMS where an individual has copyrighted its name and an organization owns the rest.) 

I'd like to suggest that this site be public, with no restricted content, and that all content submitted to the site (other than Fair Use excerpts) be owned by its creator, with a perpetual Creative Commons Share Alike license. Finally, I'd like to suggest that all intellectual property (such as domain names and hosting accounts)  be held by a trusted entity. 

To do some of the things already being discussed, such as aggregation a la wpmued.org, there are costs -- my experience is that commercial plugins are the best options in some cases. Not much cost, but they add up. So, we should consider a way to accept minimal donations (in kind or money) in a way that respects the donor.

My 2 cents. Thoughts?

Hey all,

As for wpmued.org domain, a relic of another time, though I do love it so.
Fact is, Andre Malan of UBC was the brains behind http://dev.wpmued.org, and
that was pulling in posts from various blogs that were related to wpmu and
buddypress development. I think a lot of the work folks are/were doing there
is relevant to what you all are thinking. And I'll talk to Andre and the
others (though Andre may even be on this list), but I'll venture to say this
content could move smoothly to another domain, particularly because it is
all just feeding in using FeedWordPress anyway (a feature that should be
built into the core of WP :) ). So if nothing else, you will probably have
some starter content, and then I can turn wpmued.org into the spam blog
domain it was always meant to be.

Also, I like the idea of a wiki raised, and the marriage of MediaWiki and wP
could be very useful for sharing tutorials, documentation, and the like. We
could really use this site to make using WP for education very easy, and it
sounds like there are a lot of interested parties.  I also like the idea of
keeping the wp-edu.org site (or whatever it will be named) syndication
based, so folks can share their thoughts from their own blogs if they
choose, but still allow authorship on the site. But this may be getting
ahead of ourselves, because I don;t think it is clear, as others have
pointed out, whether this is a space for sharing resources, a wordcamped, or
a slumber party. But the fact is, a relatively central and somewhat popular
place to share stuff folks are doing with WP in highered would certainly be
cool, and is what wpmued.org and dev.wpmued.org are aimed for. And before
James Farmer sold his soul to the devil that is what wpmudev.org was all
about.

But to be clear, I would suggest everyone own and maintain their own
content, and syndicate it in, and put your plugins on wordpress.org lest
this become an app machine like wpmu.org/premium.wpmudev.org. A lot of good
work was lost in the process of that transition, and that is the only thing
that would make me a a bit weary of zealous leadership in this regard.
Though it just so happens that hope springs eternal, and as long as we are
clear from the beginning this is a site dedicated to the communist/commons
ethics that should always undergird open source projects (i.e. owned by no
one) I think this is groovy.

Best,
Jim

Agreed. I would like to see the principles you reiterated protected right from the start, and I think the Creative Commons licensing model would do so.

Re licences:
Not wishing to start yet another GPL related flamefest; I just want to point
out that Creative Commons licences are not, in general, compatible with the
GNU GPL, so leave those for content only, and stick with GPL for code.
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLIncompatibleLicenses
Also you must always specify which CC licence, there are many, and they are
not all the same. http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#which-cc

Secondly,

both Create Commons and GPL *only* work (i.e. are legally enforcable) if
someone/something owns the copyright. They are all based on the copyright
owner licensing you to use the work in a certain way.

  Actually, we generally say all WordCamp videos are GPL as well, since 
anyone working with WP code during presentation strays into the gray 
areas. By saying it's all GPL, we avoid that.

Sure, that makes sense for content containing code, especially when the
parts cannot be really separated like video.

In terms of Wiki's, documents etc. GPL tends not to work as well GFDL

Hey All,

This topic has migrated quite a bit, but I think for the good.  :)   In an
effort to move forward instead of circles I have created a google doc and
made it so anyone can edit it at the link below:

https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1bsJv0nUb5Z-CdZB2XD6GcU3XP8kQiw9RDL9fyEhQDGY&hl=en&authkey=CJ-jwKkJ

I have just put up a skeleton about some of the topics that have come up.
 If you are interested in working on this project please go to the link
above and add your information.  I have also added a section for license
agreements.  I didn't realize the history.  I agree that what ever we do
should stay open and free to everyone.  Isn't that was education is all
about? :)  I'm not as familiar with the licenses as many of you are though,
so please add your thoughts.

Regarding the virtual conference (I'll stop calling a WordCamp), I still
would love to see something like that happen.  I am glad to hear there are
tracks at WordCamps around the country and will certainly keep my eye out
for those that I can attend, but I know my budget is already gone for the
year and unless a local one has an education track that is unlikely for me.


With that in mind I created a second document (that can also be edited)
focused on a virtual academic wordpress conference:

https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1WYGAV3eV4f1xDnZ4f8ozGngd2Be-f35_iSRCj-TJeCM&hl=en&authkey=CLaO-IMJ

If you are interested in the conference, please go and add your thoughts
there.  Even if you can't help organize it I think it would be great to have
your thoughts.

~Jeff

Thank you for setting that up, Jeff. I am not terribly familiar with
licenses, either, but I do think that debating their merits is a little
ahead of the game. Being clear about governance and keeping it actively in
mind while planning is very important, but I think that first creating a
solid outline of potential content will help us to determine
licensing/ownership needs. That said, I definitely agree that original
authors should be able to feel confident regarding their intellectual
property rights and that such a site would need to have a spread of
ownership in order to survive long-term.

I?ll get on contributing to that document now :)

Hey All,?

This topic has migrated quite a bit, but I think for the good. ?:) ? In an
effort to move forward instead of circles I have created a google doc and
made it so anyone can edit it at the link below:

https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1bsJv0nUb5Z-CdZB2XD6GcU3XP8kQiw9RDL
9fyEhQDGY&hl=en&authkey=CJ-jwKkJ

I have just put up a skeleton about some of the topics that have come up.
?If you are interested in working on this project please go to the link
above and add your information. ?I have also added a section for license
agreements. ?I didn't realize the history. ?I agree that what ever we do
should stay open and free to everyone. ?Isn't that was education is all
about? :) ?I'm not as familiar with the licenses as many of you are though,
so please add your thoughts.?

Regarding the virtual conference (I'll stop calling a WordCamp), I still
would love to see something like that happen. ?I am glad to hear there are
tracks at WordCamps around the country and will certainly keep my eye out
for those that I can attend, but I know my budget is already gone for the
year and unless a local one has an education track that is unlikely for me.
??

With that in mind I created a second document (that can also be edited)
focused on a virtual academic wordpress conference:

https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1WYGAV3eV4f1xDnZ4f8ozGngd2Be-f35_iS

If you are interested in the conference, please go and add your thoughts
there. ?Even if you can't help organize it I think it would be great to have
your thoughts.?

Helen-

My last 2 cents on this. For those of us who have worked at institutions with clearly-defined and strongly-enforced intellectual property policies -- and those who have created works that have been used commercially and modified without attribution -- not having a clear definition of ownership and licensing could actually prevent participating, since the text, images, and code created by a staff member is usually owned by the institution (as "work for hire"). 

This may only be true for a small number of schools, but during this time of significant transformation in higher education regarding open content, this may grow. Moving forward is understandable, but I'd simply suggest that each contributor check in with the copyright authority at your school.

C'est tout pour le moment ;)

Re: a WordCamp Ed event... count us in at Duke too. 

We finally moved out of 'pilot' phase this semester: http://sites.duke.edu

We're currently ONLY supporting course/teaching-related sites this semester. Next semester we plan on opening up the service for individual staff, students and faculty plus campus groups.

Jay, you are absolutely right. I know that I personally am in a situation
where there isn?t a whole lot of direction when it comes to initial
declarations of ownership but instead lots of post-declarations, along with
an odd amount of autonomous control and oversight of projects on my part,
but that isn?t the case for everybody. I?m not sure whether to consider
myself lucky or not in that regard!

I suppose we?d probably have to stay away from directly publishing code
examples when they belong to somebody else (e.g. a school) and be
particularly careful in making sure that we each abide by our respective
authorities (and thus keep our jobs!). I would guess that a good bit of
content will be discussions on what pre-existing plugins were used for what
function or what kind of process was undertaken for a particular proposal,
so I would think that those sorts of write-ups would belong to the
contributor.

Finally, I would venture to say that the very fact that our schools are open
to the idea of using something like WordPress in the first place is a good
step toward open content. Very interesting to see is the University of
Alabama?s Web Guide: http://webguide.ua.edu/intro.html . They actually put
their WP and mobile themes out there for download WITH extensive
documentation! I?ve actually suggested a similar approach as we turn to
WP-as-CMS and haven?t met any resistance (yet), so I am hopeful that a
culture of sharing information and mutual benefits will win out over control
issues.

C?est la fin? Yeah, right :)

Message-ID: <AANLkTimTX3sBp4s=eOE+7ktmyTZvJwnbptHcdQwpTFHq@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

As you may recall, a discussion of an educational WordCamp branched off into
ideas for a site that would function as a repository on information
regarding the use of WordPress in educational settings. A Google Doc (
https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1bsJv0nUb5Z-CdZB2XD6GcU3XP8kQiw9RDL9fyEhQDGY&hl=en)
was started and now, thanks to Jeff VanDrimmelen, wp-edu.org exists in its
beginning form!

Additions to the Google Doc are always welcome, but we have also begun a
P2-themed development blog that is open to discussion, located at
http://dev.wp-edu.org. If you are interested in any way, please come on over
and join in. Account registration isn't open at the moment, but that
shouldn't deter you from commenting anyway.

Looking forward to whatever comes next,
Helen

(Also, a big thanks to Kyle Jones for jumping right in as well!)

Subject: [wp-edu] Federated Authentication? Anyone thought about it?
Message-ID: <AANLkTinOyadS+hiBq7P5krfSNmXZnakkdSjG+s77oC06@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone else thought about allowing federated authentication to
your Wordpress instance?  Where you can allow people at different
institutions log in to your server with a username and password that
is not a part of your school's?

We're trying to do it with Shibboleth (as opposed to OAuth or some of
the other mechanisms).  The problem that we're running into is usually
a federated ID will look like an email address, which is what
indicates who the identity provider is.  However, Wordpress has some
validation checking that doesn't allow anything other than letters for
the username and the @ and . make the username invalid.  We've even
tried creating an additional plugin, or extending the existing
Shibboleth plugin, but we're still having trouble.  One source even
said that we shouldn't be allowing the @ and . in the username and
should allow for something else.

So I ask you, have you thought about this problem?  Have you had to
deal with it?  Does a solution sound easy?  Thoughts?

Thank you.

It's on our radar and I expect to be delving into it later this academic year. We've got Shibboleth working with Moodle and Drupal, and WordPress is next on the list, but I haven't done much beyond putting it on my to do list.

Hi Patrick,

Are you using the latest version of the WP Shib plugin? It now
sanitizes names order to deal with the @ problem. We're using it to
allow integration with our existing login systems, and not (yet) for
off-campus logins, but if the problem you're having is just the name
syntax that shouldn't make a difference. There are some details here:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-shibboleth-username-at-risk-of-breaking-permalinks-with-author
(note that that thread is about broken links, but it gets into user
name rewriting further down the thread).

best of luck,
Amy

We have Shibboleth working great, but I'm not sure about our federated
schools.  I will check with our identity management folks.  They really got
the shibboleth piece working for us.

Thanks Amy, I added the couple lines of code suggested in that thread.
 We're testing to see if it helps.    We are using the 1.4 version of
the Shib plugin, and we do still get an error from formatting.php when
a new user successfully authenticates.  Hopefully the code in that
discussion thread gets us around the problem.

Thank you.

I'm curious about how people have enabled/use video; do you allow your users to upload video into wordpress? Do you have file size restrictions? Or are you just directing that content to youtube and embedding? We're typically getting requests to be able to add video in the 50-100 meg range.

Cheers

To me, blog servers are for blogs and video servers are for videos.  I
don't think many people size their blog, wiki, or other hardware
really for video storage, so in my opinion it's best to have the video
live on a video server (preferably on campus if you have a video
server) and simply link to it.

Laura,

We don;t have it fully functional yet, but we are playing with VideoPress on
a dev server. As of now we have students and faculty use YouTube, Vimeo,
Blip.tv, etc. But at least for a few projects we wouls like the option of
inhouse video (though external sites are still the way to go for the most
part).

As we figure this out, I'll try and get the list updated. I'm liking the
integration of VideoPress and WPMS, so we'll see.

Best,
Jim

I agree with Patrick about using a streaming server/service to deliver the video. There are a lot of free options (Vimeo doesn't have the size limit that YouTube does).  

On Wordpress, we use a plugin called "Viper's Video Quicktags" to enable easy embedding of videos delivered through all the standard services. I don't have to do much to support the bloggers using videos, so it must be working okay.

We found that the new Shib plugin does work and fix the authors
problem as described in the thread.  However it doesn't fix the
username issue.  We're still running into that.

All the filtering and sanitizing is being done after the registration,
and that's where the problem is coming in.  First time registrants
trying to log in to the system.  When WP tries to create their
account, the @ and . are killing it.  But if they're already in the
system, logging in is no problem.

So one solution is that we can add every user at our University and
then there will be no problems with that.

However one of the major reasons to use Shibboleth (along with SSO) is
federation.  I don't know who's going to need access from other
institutions and I really don't want to be creating those on an
as-needed basis.  So we'd prefer for this to work.

I'm guessing that this is just another filter that needs to happen in
the account creation where the @ and . is allowed.  We're just trying
to find the right place and the right hooks to make it happen.

If anyone else thinks they know what would make that work, it would be
appreciated.

Thanks.

Patrick

We have students (and faculty) using video a lot, and we try to direct them to use YouTube or Vimeo as much as possible.  But in some cases, for various reasons, uploading directly to WordPress is the best solution (for classes where access to the videos needs to be limited, or where many students need to upload and have the video available rapidly, without waiting for processing time, or where the videos are too long or too large for the external services).  In those cases, we just up the filesize and storage limits as much as necessary.  These increases have to be requested, but I have always granted every request, and expect to continue to do so.  

I'm very interested in Jim's VideoPress progress, and will be following that closely!  (also wondering about MediaCore.  Anyone going in that direction?)

FYI. As you may know, since WordPress 2.9, they've included at least some of
Viper Video Quicktags in WordPress itself. No need for a plugin.

You can embed YouTube videos by simply putting the URL to the video on one
line:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeGteg74mjw

And WordPress takes care of the rest. Nice.

More info: http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds

Viper's lets you do more... but we've found the built-in functionality to
work well.

Same here. Direct uploads to WP for privacy related issues. We use the Anarchy Media Player plugin for the player.

We're looking into Kaltura as a more robust video platform.

We have students (and faculty) using video a lot, and we try to direct them to use YouTube or Vimeo as much as possible.  But in some cases, for various reasons, uploading directly to WordPress is the best solution (for classes where access to the videos needs to be limited, or where many students need to upload and have the video available rapidly, without waiting for processing time, or where the videos are too long or too large for the external services).  In those cases, we just up the filesize and storage limits as much as necessary.  These increases have to be requested, but I have always granted every request, and expect to continue to do so.  

I'm very interested in Jim's VideoPress progress, and will be following that closely!  (also wondering about MediaCore.  Anyone going in that direction?)

There is a Google Apps integration plugin that creates accounts on the
fly using the email address as a username. Can't remember which plugin
it was now.

Perhaps it's worth having a search, and/or posting to wp-hackers to
ask which filter would allow those characters in usernames.
