Message-ID: <5F90936A-6E26-4F02-8366-28D1C2206B25@tufts.edu>

Hi all,

I once had a link to a Google Sheet that listed schools using Wordpress in multisite mode. Is that still around? We are doing a survey of our existing themes and plugins and looking to peers for advice on what we should remove/install.

Thanks,

David

Hi David,

Is this the Google Sheet you?re thinking of? Originally created by Jay Collier, I believe, many years back. Hasn?t been updated since 2016, but might still be useful:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LZmAqDjhkn-9GfkgiwK2lbQvuuMsCmmc6zNaZNVm_kI/edit?usp=sharing

Best,
Adam

I haven?t seen updates for a while, but it would be great to have people weigh-in on changes.

Thank you, Michael!

I see a number of other updates over recent days, too. I encourage everyone to take a look at their current listings and correct them, if needed.

Much appreciated,
