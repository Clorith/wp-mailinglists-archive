Message-ID: <20090205202148.GE28103@lambic.co.uk>

Hi all,

I'm just wondering what other institutions are using for their blog
comment spam protection; Are you paying for Akismet? Paying for
something else? Or using one or more of the free plugins?


Also, there's a debate raging here over whether all blogs should use the
same basic theme or all the blogs can look different (I'm in the looking
different camp, blogs should have individual personality IMO). Any
similar debates happened elsewhere? What was the outcome?

I use Akismet on UCalgaryblogs.ca - you do need to give a link back to  
Akismet as part of the license, but it's free. I wrote a simple plugin  
to automatically do that for all sites on a WPMU install.

They have been granting permission to use without cost to educational  
institutions. You have to contact them directly, but it hasn't been a  
problem yet.

Look down at the bottom:  We got ours for free. We're an edu

Free option

We can provide an API key completely free of charge for selected non-profits
in exchange for some promotion, specifically links to WordPress.com and
Akismet.com on each of the protected blogs. What's required?

    * A link to akismet.com on every page.
    * A link to wordpress.com on every page.
    * Contact us with your key and website after you've added the links, so
we can check the links and mark your key so it doesn't trigger our
anti-abuse systems.

Here is the code for the links:

<a href="http://akismet.com/">Protected by Akismet</a><br />
<a href="http://wordpress.com/">Blog with WordPress</a>

Yes, not free, the cost is just non-monetary. Are you linking to akismet
and wordpress on every blog?

Yes, we wrote a plugin that inserts the code into the footer.

http://antispam.typepad.com/ is completely free. I use it on a commercial

Hey Mark,

We have Akismet, but I've also played a bit with "Raven's Antispam" which uses javascript to display the "submit" button.  If no javascript then sort of a simple text captcha appears.  I'm not sure how effective that will be for the long term, but I think a lot of folks find captchas can be pretty frustrating.

Blogs@Baruch also has the free option. Unlike our more efficient and
talented Canadian cousins, we hard coded it into the footer of each theme
offered on our WPMU install.

Handy, thanks. There seems to be some resistance to that option but I'm
trying to promote it.

Hi,

I wanted to respond to the issue of all blogs looking the same.  I had this
battle and won (I'm in your camp btw).  The whole point of the blog site was
for faculty who didn't like the monochrome of Blackboard.  We came up with
somewhat of a compromise for people who were using the blogs as part of an
official college website, they needed to use a template that we created.

My argument was that a "looks-all-the-same" approach would scare away anyone
who had any desire to use it.

We're actually using Spam Karma for anti-spam (I know, it's discontinued).  It seems to work very well, so far.  I've always liked it and used it on other stand-alone installations, and I've been pleased with it in WPMU, too.

As for the everything-the-same question, we're very much committed to giving our students the opportunity to express themselves through design, rather than content, so having everything look different (we have about 100 themes installed so far, plus the userthemes plugin as needed) was a big draw and a major reason to use wpmu.

I'm not sure if I'm ahead or behind the curve here (or even if I'm on the right course), but I've been using WP-SpamFree on my WPMU site, and I've loved it.  I've not had a single bit of spam get through, even for moderation, since I installed it last April.
 
I have had a few people complain about error messages since the last version update of the plugin a couple of weeks ago, but when I suggested they try it in Firefox instead of IE, they've not had problems.

Hi all,

I'm just wondering what other institutions are using for their blog
comment spam protection; Are you paying for Akismet? Paying for
something else? Or using one or more of the free plugins?


Also, there's a debate raging here over whether all blogs should use the
same basic theme or all the blogs can look different (I'm in the looking
different camp, blogs should have individual personality IMO). Any
similar debates happened elsewhere? What was the outcome?

Ditto on SpamFree.  I absolutely love it. I occasionally get 'manual 
spam' where someone's trying to advertise themselves, but it's clear 
they've read the articles and what not.  No bulk spam at all.  I haven't 
seen errors either.

Subject: [wp-edu] Restricting authors to specific category posting
Message-ID: <66BEB1F62153EE4EB54ECACD76E259915BD2480F0C@john.ad.clarku.edu>

Hi all,

I've been thinking about how using Wordpress to host our academic catalog may be a good next step.  Clark's catalog (www.clarku.edu/academiccatalog/<http://www.clarku.edu/academiccatalog/> )  is a custom system that was coded from scratch in ColdFusion/MSSQL.  The administrative back end lets specific authors access/edit content only for their particular academic department.  So, in order for me to even consider doing something similar with WP, I'd need to have the capability to restrict authors to certain "areas" or categories which would correspond to their academic programs.  I've been looking for a plugin that would apply such a restriction, but so far haven't come across anything like it - and I haven't seen this as the default functionality in Wordpress 2.7.

Thanks for any suggestions!

Chuck Wyatt

Chuck,

Not sure if you want a blog for each department, and then syndicate
them into an overall catalog blog with appropriate category for each
discipline, but the role manager plugin may be useful, or even the add
user sidebr widget with will allow users to add themselves to a blog,
and have specific permissions.

It's a cool idea, let me know how it works out.

Hi Jim,

Currently we have a relational database that handles linking between faculty records, course records and they live under a "master" department.  Editors for that master department can edit and link their own faculty/courses.  So that's quite a bit of specific relational functionality that may not easily fit in something so fluid as WP.  I'll check out role manager, though!

Thanks!

-Chuck

Message-ID: <5a149a600902272302s4239e9ado672091f50c26b8e8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just found this list and I hope that what I want to do fits the purpose of
the list somewhat. From looking through the archives, I'm hoping I'm not off
target.

I presently have an online sewing school using Moodle and although the
software is great it doesn't lend itself as well to a commercial
environment. in addition, my instructors are not always real computer savvy
so it makes it difficult for them to wade thru the complexity of it.  Plus
so much of it is overkill for my use.  (Don't need grading e, LMS etc.) I
needed a frontend (for the commercial aspect) which i tried Joomla but the
integraton was just too cumbersome.

So I've decide to use WorPress because it's easier to use for all. It will
be a pay per course or group of courses with a variety of instructors.  Lots
of videos, forums for each course, photo galleries etc. And of course there
will be a fabric store, book stores etc., at the front end. And so I have
lots to do with getting ready for the move of the school.

I'm looking at membershp plugins, PayPal plugins, course plugs and many
other plugins. I'm testing many of them now.

Is anyone out there trying or have a online school that charges per course
and has a curriculum? Or something similar?

Hi all,

I've been asked to make some modifications to the PodPress plugin,
specifically to add the itunesu:category tag and to fix the  apparently
quite broken ID3 tag support.

Before I start re-inventing the wheel, has anyone done this already and
are willing to share?
