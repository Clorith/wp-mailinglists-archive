Hi,

Been using WP in diverse contexts, including some of my activities as
an instructor.
After talking with diverse people needing advice about Web solutions
for all sorts of things, I came to the realization that it'd be
incredibly useful to have a university-supported install of WordPress
(Multi-Site and hopefully BuddyPress-enabled).

It's a big institution, so it can be difficult to request such things.
Actually, the communications department is in the RFP phase of
implementing a new (commercial) CMS, so energies are spent elsewhere.

We use Moodle as the main course management system for most of the
community, though the business school uses FirstClass for the same
purposes. Many faculty members are dissatisfied with their course
management system and, clearly, there's a need for something which
goes beyond individual courses. This is a university with a strong
involvement in the local community and there are many projects by
students, staff, and faculty which could use an online space as a kind
of ?university commons?.
What's more, it'd be interesting to have some people do innovative
work through WordPress. A dream I have is to use WP as a repository
for ?learning objects?. Such projects can be done independently, but
they're more interesting if they're hosted on university servers.
Way back when, universities had ?personal homepages?, for all
affiliated individuals. Why can't we have WP sites and BuddyPress
profiles?

Does anyone have advice on getting an academic institution to accept
WP on their servers? I'll try to prepare a dossier, pointing to work
done at diverse institutions (good thing Boone paved the way), and
describing practical cases from faculty initiatives. It even sounds
like the fear of having sensitive data held off-site could be a
factor. But any insight as to how such a process went at other
institutions would be very useful.

Thank you.

We use WordPress for a variety of purposes at Wesleyan. Many other
institutions use WordPress, too. You might want to have a look at this

Hey Alex,
It is like pulling teeth from a tyrannosaurus :-)
I was sole developer/designer/administrator for Empire State College's
"Commons" http://commons.esc.edu

It was a long road to get an instance set up, and once I did I had to
approve all development decisions with non-technical director, which
restrained most of my ideas.  A little side note... this was developed and
launched a year and half ago, and I've left my position since, because of
the experience.  ESC's Commons has Buddypress (really old version)
installed, but most of it is disabled, and if I remember correctly I ended
up hacking the core of Buddypress to get rid of some of the functionality,
which was totally against my better judgement, but just wanted to get
something a little more user-friendly for faculty to use and experiment with
(deadlines).  I launched it and then left my position, and will soon be
leaving the education sector all together.

Our school has been using ANGEL for LMS for several years and has been
investigating the next move to another LMS for over a year with a recent
announcement that the next contendor will be Moodle.  As far as CMS we had
been running on Lotus Notes, which was a half-baked homegrown CMS solution.
 If you can call it that.  ESC is finally moving to a commercial solution
(Terminal4), which is almost a year in on transition and there are 1 or 2
live micro-sites, but nothing official yet.

ESC's instance of WPMU (v 2.7 if I remember correctly) is running on an
internal server, which was hell setting up.  Authentication was a huge
sticky point as our systems were antiquated (Lotus/LDAP/Active Directory).
 We ended up using LDAP plugin, but still wasn't working the way I would of
liked to.  There have been no updates to the platform, and it is still
running on the WPMU 2.7.

My advice would be to get ready to contribute code to WP community.  Perhaps
try to get a part-time or full-time developer to help get the system
running.  Depending on how many customizations you'll need.  The CUNY
Commons is a great example of what can be done.  Also, check out Stas'
progress on LMS-like functionality for WP: http://sushkov.wordpress.com/

Good luck!
feel free to email me if you have any further specific questions:

Hi Alex,

It's a really good question and I think the idea of collecting experiences to compare and contrast and maybe find some common lessons is a terrific idea.

Our situation here at Macaulay is a bit anomalous, but I'll still be glad to describe it.  And I have been involved at least marginally in the planning and implementation of the CUNY Academic Commons, so I'll comment on that, too, with the hope that Matt Gold or Boone or someone with more of a leadership role in the project will jump in and amplify and correct.  And I'll challenge Jim Groom to jump in, with his stories, and Luke Waltzer from Baruch with his (very much in progress) stories.  Maybe Michael Smith or Michael Cripps can tell us something about how it's gone at York College, too.

Let me start with Macaulay.  Because we're a part of a larger university (CUNY) we have some of the same struggles with less-than-cooperative, security-over-usability, enterprise-over-education, philosophies from the IT department that other folks have had.  But because we're also a somewhat independent, small, cross-campus unit of that larger university, we can be flexible enough to avoid some of those struggles.  We first implemented WordPress in 2008 as an eportfolio platform (adding BuddyPress the next year) and that was really my original vision of what it would be. 

But almost immediately, because of the flexibility of the platform, and because of other factors (notably a widespread dissatisfaction among faculty with the university's LMS--Blackboard--and then a long-lasting, unexplained, technical failure of Blackboard access right when classes most needed it), faculty and students began asking to use, or just using, WordPress for all kinds of different purposes.  Everything from just the most basic class website use (posting syllabus and schedule and readings) to a full-fledged LMS.  From club publications and student newspapers, to study-abroad blogs or poetry or graphic design collaboration sites.  And of course for eportfolios, as well.

We avoided some of the issues that worry IT departments by having the install on a separate server, outsourced, and very intentionally NOT linking it to any kind of single-signon, Active Directory, or LDAP.  That made things like course-setup and student enrollment in the system a little more difficult...but only a little.  And it was a better fit philosophically for what we wanted to accomplish--more of a do-it-yourself ethos where students enroll themselves and manage their own passwords and accounts.  All of this happened with a tiny IT staff--basically, for the first year or so, it was me alone.  And it's still mainly just me, and not at all my full-time role.

I think the biggest factor that made it a success was that we just did it, got it installed and started, and then let faculty and students start using the system.  I did some promotion (and our Instructional Technology Fellows were a big help with this), but the main road to acceptance came from people seeing examples of success and then saying "I want to be part of that.  I want to try something like that."

Then there's the case of the CUNY Academic Commons.  There we had some degree of official IT acceptance and support right from the beginning, but again it was more a matter of building first, on a separate server not managed by the central IT, not linked to any of their secure systems, and then letting success grow from success. The Commons is a little bit of a different beast because (at least at present) it is generally not open to undergraduate classes or students.  It's only for faculty, staff, administrators and graduate students (mostly, I would say, faculty and grad students--which are often the same thing).  So that alleviated right from the start some of the concerns that IT departments sometimes have.  Like I said, I hope Matt or Boone or someone will give more details about that, but I think the main lesson was a similar kind of DIY and pioneering approach is the way to get started.  Not waiting for official permission or sanction, but building a successful system in whatever kind of separate or easily-managed controlled environment you can manage, and then getting the official support later.  

It seems you just need to take whatever window or small niche you can find to get going, then you can present to the central IT folks a fait accompli, already working and successful and secure...and with a strong user base in place who would not settle for being told "no."  It wasn't a matter of a lone voice in the wilderness: "why can't we have WordPress!" but a chorus of successful users "we are so happy to have WordPress, let's get it more integrated and supported!"

I know that Blogs at Baruch (again, I hope Luke will say more) started small and limited, and now have moved to much wider acceptance and usage and impact in the institution as a whole, and I know that Jim started UMW Blogs on a separate server, a separate hosting account (a .org, in fact, not even an official college site, right Jim?), and it was only after he had the success that he got the official acceptance and welcoming.

You do need (at least) one dedicated, friendly, daring administrator or sponsor right from the start.  Someone who's going to either sign off, help out, or at least look the other way.  But I honestly think it's OK (maybe even preferable) to start with a slightly outlaw flavor.  That may be stating it too strongly--"alternative" might be better than "outlaw."  

I don't mean to minimize the political or administrative risks here--that's why it helps to have that high-level sponsor or collaborator.  And you do need to be for real about security and privacy and backups and staffing and scalability.  You have to know your stuff and have answers for the questions that will come.  If things look amateurish or unsafe, or even worse, if they actually are unsafe, you're never going to make a breakthrough.

But I think it is possible, in many institutions, to get past the institutional inertia and caution (some of which is actually reasonable).  The spreadsheet Kevin Willarty linked is good evidence of that.  If you start a small project, maybe for one department or one area of the college, one place where you can have control and the risks don't seem forbidding, you can definitely grow from there.

I went on too long, here, didn't I? But of course happy to discuss more.

Joe

The Showcase shows some simply awesome samples of WordPress in education for a variety of projects. 

http://wordpress.org/showcase/tag/education/

And no, ironically you won't find nicholls.edu in the showcase. Although I've been using WordPress to maintain the public portion of the website since 2006, the front of nicholls.edu was only just converted to WordPress in early June. I've personally been in and out of WordPress for a little while longer ;)

I suppose you could say it crawled in there and just assimilated like some kinda Borg, but that backend migration to WordPress was thoughtful and based on the growth of the software especially with the WPMU > WP merge. It also became a philosophical need to create a collaborative editing environment since I don't have a staff and budgets are really tight. I introduced tools and talked to vendors for a while, but Nicholls really had to do something or suffer extremely slow content updates and poor quality of information. WordPress won when my users made it work for THEM as they needed it for their students and audience. 

The upside is that my departments own their content. Sure I have administrative power, but I rarely use it. Many folks here realize that they need to welcome students to Nicholls for an education, and (to be blunt ) that is the job. It also doesn't hurt when upgrades to administrative systems come at $$ with many 0000000's, and I occasionally have to ask for money for a contractor or plugin, or one of those fancy web-app-in-the-cloud things that we're all supposed to be embracing anyway. ;) The budget side of it and the ease of finding quality contractors for projects and support is also easy to point at. These days, folks around here aren't impressed by expensive budget items.

I could go on. It's the web, so my last major issue I have with many closed content tools is "lock in". If WordPress the project ends tomorrow, I start looking for a replacement and Grok a migration script when necessary. WordPress is not alone as a solutions, but it "works for me". 

You are also welcome to contact me off list if you have any other questions.

Hi - i just wanted to jump into this thread a bit given the outlaw 
suggestions of starting outside the IT/political boxes ...

while reading some of the comments i was reminded about conversation 
i had in mid 90s with IBM's John Patrick ... at the time he was part 
of big blue's top brass, famed internally for thinkbook innovation, 
famed outside with his global speaking about all things web (e.g., he 
went on to author book called Net Attitude) plus sundry other 
accomplishments but his story about AlphaWorks project was what i 
wanted to share here ...

if memory serves correct, at the time John was frustrated with the 
internal silos (e.g., the AS400 people did not talk to the Lotus 
people, etc) and as a culture they were super brainy but marketing 
kerplunk* ... so in an effort to jump start relations with outside 
developers, programmers and emerging web development community, he 
went outside his organization, bought a domain, set up a site, and 
grained massive traction ... then at some point, the powers that were 
woke up, bought his domain and rolled that "skunks work project" back 
into their main core as outreach effort to get products from lab to 
markets but i digress ...

he and i enjoyed many strategy discussions along the way as we worked 
on a couple other projects but he also shared two things that might 
be relevant to this thread ->

a) last to change ... one of the things i first heard from a mentor 
in 1992 and then echoed again by John later was that the last three 
organizations that will be totally transformed by web technologies 
will be Wall Street, Education, and Government - in that order ... i 
think history is pretty much showing this to be correct ... with 
Paypal, online trading and now bitcoin technology, the finance impact 
is pretty clear ... with the rising cost of traditional education and 
it's dubious advantage in a "just-in-time learning" globalized world, 
it is only a matter of time before lynda.com's and others put a real 
dent into education markets but to be continued in this education 
changing dept via web but my bet = WordPress will have HUGE part ... 
and with respect to gov'ts, well, Arab Spring from social media is 
only a beginning but here to we see WP playing huge role in more and 
more gov't agencies ...

b) plan-build-deploy vs sense-and-respond ... apparently this was a 
big part of John's message to those would listen to him in that the 
old days, the plan-build-deploy worked great but not so much today 
given the massive changes from some many levels ... he would laugh 
when he said "Chuck, by the time we implement a given set of plans, 
two years would go by and the world was different then when we 
started out so much better to approach new markets via 
sense-and-respond method, then if it starts to take off, well then, 
lock and load and make it industrial..."

anyhow just sharing as fyi for those free thinkers and doers out here 
on this list ... accordingly, i echo much of the sentiment in recent 
thread - just do it :>)

cordially, chuck scott


*once i enjoyed the opportunity to sit in on a high-level meeting at 
Watson research whereby it was the first time the Lotus team (they 
had just been acquired) was meeting with key web / media team to set 
the global strategy for IBM .. there were like 27 people at the table 
and 25 of them had doctorates ... i was the only outsider and part of 
the reason i was invited in was because they were trying to get 
better with the marketing and outreach to developers ... yet i share 
this because there was one part of conversation about streaming media 
servers and competitors and first to market ... during that thread we 
talked about how hot mail was just picked up for mega-millions with 
less than 2 years under their belt and scant revenues ... so while i 
was promoting the merits of first to market moves, one of them said 
to me, "Ah, gee Chuck - none of that really matters to us. Do you 
know how much cash we have on our balance sheet? Any market we miss, 
we can just buy our way in" to which i thought about it for a moment 
and replied, "Understood. They certainly didn't teach us that one in 
business school but given your cash i can see your point."

I think over here at the Eastman School of Music (part of the University of
Rochester), we are fortunate to have some very forward-minded in-house IT
people, our own web server setup, and a very budget-conscious upper
administration. We are a little strange in that web was moved out of
Communications into Computing Services (aka IT) some years ago, before I was
here, and our roles as web people are a little blended. We also had a solid
precedent in that the main campus allowed the Memorial Art Gallery (also a
part of the UR) to move to WP as their CMS. That said, it still took a good
bit of "strategery" and creative explanations to get over those common humps
of "if it's free, it can't be good" and "I've heard that WordPress gets
hacked all the time". Here are the things I think sold our particular case:

- WordPress is free, is under constant development, has a large (and
friendly!) community, and provides a strong base for rapid development
- The use of a web-based CMS would help to start cutting back the number of
Adobe licenses needed and save money (Dreamweaver, Contribute, and even
Photoshop for image resizing)
- The ease of editing and focus on content allows for more editors to be
trained more efficiently and help keep site content current and accurate
- Having a central Eastman theme would promote branding and identity,
allowing us to transition older, individually-designed sites back into the
fold
- Using network sites and role management plugins allow us to easily assign
users to specific sites or pages (or even faculty to their own faculty
custom post type entry) without having to create more web server accounts
- Being able to easily add media helps our cause as a music school,
especially for prospective students looking to hear or see recent
performances of ensembles, faculty members, or students
- Having theme/template files be completely separate from the content helps
prevent non-technical editors from "breaking" pages (no more trailing
</div>s!)
- Having the content in a database will allow for a mobile site to be
developed much more readily and thoroughly
- BuddyPress will allow for us to much more easily realize the Dean's dream
of a "student underground" whenever we might get there

We also promoted a couple of specific plugins in terms of saving time and
resources for our very very limited web people: there are just 1.5 of us
here, and our duties include server and software management and training in
addition to content, development, and even things like photography and
social media, all for a school of 900+ collegiate students, 160 music
faculty, and who-knows-how-many staff members, community music students,
concert goers, etc. So for instance, Gravity Forms has already saved us
countless hours of form development. For anybody who's ever had to write a
form and/or validation, you'll appreciate the time it saves, and presenting
on how you can create a form with validation in a few clicks as opposed to a
few hours makes even non-tech types go "ooooo". They also really liked that
you could view entries in the Dashboard and leave internal notes, etc. To
have that kind of tool already available within the framework of WP
definitely helped us promote the project, even internally.

One dean also particularly liked that we were easily able to add homepage
alerts that auto-expire. It sounds like a small thing, but I've found that
administrative-types really, really like it when you address their specific
concerns very quickly. I'd hate to think about how we'd have to create a new
table for entries and set up the logic for it on our old homepage - not
difficult by any means, but it was definitely much faster and more robust to
add a content scheduling plugin and create a new category for announcements
to be displayed in an area on the homepage. I think that might be biggest
point, actually; that really honing in on some features that the bigwigs are
looking for will help ply them and make them receptive to the rest of the
case.

Our ed tech guy is also really interested in how WordPress is working out as
an LMS, and our IT people are all for not paying for/supporting Blackboard;
as a few of you have heard me mention before, we actually have a licensing
agreement with the main UR campus and pay for things like Blackboard. It's
all fair and well enough, but of course the school would like to spend less.
I've been using WP as a course site in teaching summer session courses on
web construction for musicians after spending the academic year slogging
through Bb and it's been wonderful, even just as a site/forums without the
use of BuddyPress or a plugin like Courseware. I imagine it only gets better
and better for those of you who are really heavy on the LMS thing. My guess
is that administration and faculty/staff will love the idea that once
they're trained to use WordPress and maybe a couple specific plugins,
they'll be able to accomplish even more, instead of having to be taught to
use Blackboard as something completely separate. We'll also have more
ownership of our own content, as Blackboard is not hosted on our own servers
and the ed tech guy has to play liaison to get courses copied or users
added, that sort of thing.

I know that since I'm a developer-type more than an educator (though I do
enjoy teaching), this is definitely heavily biased toward the developer
side, but I think it's all part of one very big, very strong case for
WordPress in schools and universities.

All,

Impressed by and grateful for all the thoughtful responses to my query about
getting acceptance for a WordPress instance on campus. Very useful advice
and important cautionary tales.

More specifically, it helps me situate my university in that context. In
some ways, resistance is less rigid than in some of your cases. Key people
are trying to listen to all of these arguments, and they are open to some
initiatives. At the same time, there's a chilling effect related to fears
about potential legal issues which not only creates distortion in the
conversation but makes it difficult to integrate social media projects with
other activities.

And social media is really what we're talking about, in our case. Not only
blogs, podcasts, and microblogging, but social networking, user-generated
content, and even ?cloud computing?. WP can help with all of these but the
fears come from issues with commercial services.
And this where things take an interesting turn.
Many people at the university are using a variety of social media services.
At our institution, people are struggling with policies and guidelines to
adopt, in order to prevent all sorts of issues having to do with privacy,
copyright, branding, security, etc. While there are diverse initiatives to
use social media in relation to university work (including community
outreach, teaching, and research), the ?official word? tends to be that
proper authorities should be notified. Obviously, nobody has a way to
monitor what members of the university community are doing on Twitter,
Facebook, or even WordPress.com?
And we happen to be a community-oriented institution. It?d make so much
sense to connect with the local community through social media!
Now, the search for a university-wide CMS allegedly does include several
things about social media. But it?ll be a long process and it?s one which
doesn?t really involve members of the community.
This is probably where I?m not framing the issue properly. As diverse people
have explained, getting a WP instance on campus should probably start from a
modest initiative. With some technical support (I?m not skilled or
credentialed enough to do much), individual initiatives could work well and
eventually spread more broadly.

We?ll see how things go.

In the meantime, very sincere thanks for all your help. Further proof that
the WP community is friendly and helpful. Honestly, I?m touched.

Hi Alexandre,

My university, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) leads a WordPress Multi-blog platform located at this url: http://blogs.ntu.edu.sg. It has been almost 1 years we have initiated this project and now in the process to move it up to WordPress 3.2.

Yups, we experienced all of both technical and implementation knowledge during this process. Neverless, we are looking forward to expands it further. This blog management platforms is currently hosting more than 100 blogs for the university and a combined initiative between academic librarians and the fellows at the Centre for IT services. And hosted locally in the university.

If you are looking for the areas of all the elements such as new media and cloud computing, my team did a step out from our comfort zone in the university. We start of a social enterprising project to help non profit organisation (academic purpose) to embrace WordPress as their core site and spread to micro site advocacy. One local organisations is Angakatan Sasterawan 50 (http://asas50.com) , a Non Profit Organisation formed by scholarly writers and author, we collaborated with them to build a digital portal that embrace library science. And we used WordPress as the foundation seed.

Another project that is currently going and built is SMSO (http://mysmso.org), a non profit organisation formed by two student from Cambridge and Imperial Collage, decided to collaborate with us from NTU to create a portal that have resource sharing with the community on scholarship & researches overseas. This is to give a priority to local Singaporeans to look abroad to further their studies into colleges and universities level.

Yups, my team did not start this project with a big bang. We start off small as a single platform blog and then it grew into a multi-site. We are willingly to share out. We are not perfect, as we still need help and advice on the technical infrastructure of hosting this project. We start this project when we are in our graduate school. Now, it is deployed at university level and we are now working with the university making this initiative grow and sustain.

Regards,
Hazman Aziz

Hello all,

We are currently running WP 3.0.3. in multisite mode. 

I'd like to be able to provide certain site owners the power to edit the custom themes we've set up for their sites. Does anyone know of a plugin that would allow me to do this? E.g. give this particular user the power to edit this particular set of theme files without giving them superadmin rights.

If you just want them to edit the CSS, then the WordPress Custom CSS plugin is the perfect alternative.

But if you want them to have the ability to edit the actual php of the theme files, then you need to use Userthemes.  This plugin has been discontinued, no longer in development and no longer functioning (even in the newer "Userthemes Revisited") version. 

But we had this exact need, and so have redeveloped the plugin into something we call "Nouveau Userthemes."  It lets you (super admin) activate userthemes for specific sites that you choose.  Once it's activated, that specifc site owner can "copy" any installed theme into a usertheme, and then edit that theme freely (from within the dashboard) without affecting the site's themes or needing ftp access to your server.  

This approach does have extreme security risks--I mean very extreme--if you allow it for anyone except ABSOLUTELY trusted site owners.  So I'm not releasing the plugin publicly.  But if you're willing observe that caveat (and take the responsibility yourself, not blame me if it goes wrong!), I'm more than willing to share.

Let me know off-list if you're interested and I'll be glad to send a copy with instructions.

Message-ID: <AE8BE2E24729AE45A3B4448BAEA699001524BBB8@ITS-MSXMBS3F.ad.unc.edu>

Hey All,

I am hoping to garner some ideas from what other Universities are doing for the sign-up process for new users on their wordpress instances.

In the past we have been using the Shibboleth plugin to authenticate new users: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shibboleth/

Signups are disabled on the site.  All users have to use the campus ID to log in the first time.  Since they use shibboleth there is no need for a signup.  After they log in the first time then can go to the signup page (new sites are allowed for existing users).

Well, for us apparently 3.2 has broken the plugin, at least on our instance.  I have contacted the developers but not sure if/when they are going to update.

When they authenticate and go back to the site it just goes blank.  I have tried troubleshooting.  Current users can still log in.  But new users go to a blank screen.  Debugging gives this error: Catchable fatal error: Object of class WP_Error could not be converted to string in /home/html/web-dev.unc.edu/html/wp-includes/formatting.php on line 2829

I have googled and tried lots of solutions, but nothing is working so far, so I am looking to see if anyone out there has any ideas on a fix (or an updated shibboleth plugin they are using) or other workflow ideas?  I am also just curious what others are using for signing up new users on their campus.

Thanks for any advice, tips you can offer.

I'll be there! I just left my position as digital media manager at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism yesterday, but I'm very happy to chat about WordPress in education. I'm @danielbachhuber on Twitter if you want to meet up

I hope you (and everyone) will share what you've learned during your recent renovations. (I'm planning to save time during the first session for discussion.)

The Boston WordCamp is amazing, and a number of us are reviving the discussion about sharing our collective knowledge about WP in Higher Education (or, more broadly, education in general).

I've created a Google sheet to find out who is interested: <http://bit.ly/qR4lqB>. Watch the changes being made already!

If you're interested, there's a lot being posted at: <http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23wcbos>. (#wcbos is trending!)
