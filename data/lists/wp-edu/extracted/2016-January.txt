Subject: [wp-edu] New plugin for embedding Scratch project into WordPress
	posts/pages
Message-ID: <618913179437F14AB3A65275853EA37271CC460F@MAIL.cti.gr>

Hi.
We have created a plugin which allows a scratch project from scratch.mit.edu to be embed in a post by simple copy-paste it's URL.
It is multisite ready.

You can find it in https://wordpress.org/plugins/ls-oembed-support-for-scratch-mit/

Please leave a comment into the WordPress forums if you experience any trouble with it.

Bests,
Lena Stergatou

I guess this is an informal survey. Feel free to respond to me off-list.
Looking to build up a list of examples of university names running
Wordpress-as-a-service for their constituents. If you have total number of
sites, that would be cool too. Also if you are running the service
internally or through a hosting company like Campuspress or WPEngine.

We're running two Wordpress instances here at Mount Holyoke, both
internally hosted: folio.mtholyoke.edu (e-portfolios) and
commons.mtholyoke.edu (student blogs/sites). I don't have numbers off the
top of my head, but we launched Commons last year and I seem to remember
it's got a couple hundred or so blogs/sites on it so far, which is fairly
substantial given that we only have a couple thousand students. Both
services are growing steadily.

I used to work at UMass Amherst and I know they have an internally-hosted
Wordpress instance at blogs.umass.edu. This has a few thousand blogs on it
(enough that mysqldump would choke and die horribly if you tried to dump
the entire Wordpress database). Much of what's there was just built by
students for various classes and immediately abandoned, but they do prune
old content after the blog owners leave UMass, so it's not all a gigantic
mass of abandoned content.

Hello folks,

We are looking into standing up the WP based Commons in a Box (http://commonsinabox.org/) from CUNY.

Has anyone else on this list done this? I'm particularly interested in how people built critical mass in terms of faculty use. How did you get faculty engaged with the site and then maintain their interest in using it?

Thanks,

David

This caught my eye:

"enough that mysqldump would choke and die horribly if you tried to dump the
entire Wordpress database"

So how, in fact, was the database backed up?

Thanks,

You would probably need to do some custom scripting to back it up in
chunks, or at the worst, 1 table at a time.



I was at a presentation at WordCamp Philly last year where a staff member
from WPEngine was discussing large multisite installations and the issues
with table proliferation as your network grows. They had some interesting
hardware architecture solutions at WPEngine, but that would be beyond the
scope of most internally run WPMU platforms.

This caught my eye:



"enough that mysqldump would choke and die horribly if you tried to
dump the entire Wordpress database"



So how, in fact, was the database backed up?



Thanks,

Hi Ben,



There is an unofficial list that someone started over at



https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LZmAqDjhkn-9GfkgiwK2lbQvuuMsCmmc6zNaZNVm_kI/edit#gid=0



that might help

We're running two Wordpress instances here at Mount Holyoke, both
internally hosted: folio.mtholyoke.edu (e-portfolios) and
commons.mtholyoke.edu (student blogs/sites). I don't have numbers off the
top of my head, but we launched Commons last year and I seem to remember
it's got a couple hundred or so blogs/sites on it so far, which is fairly
substantial given that we only have a couple thousand students. Both
services are growing steadily.

I used to work at UMass Amherst and I know they have an internally-hosted
Wordpress instance at blogs.umass.edu. This has a few thousand blogs on it
(enough that mysqldump would choke and die horribly if you tried to dump
the entire Wordpress database). Much of what's there was just built by
students for various classes and immediately abandoned, but they do prune
old content after the blog owners leave UMass, so it's not all a gigantic
mass of abandoned content.

Hello folks,

We are looking into standing up the WP based Commons in a Box (
http://commonsinabox.org/) from CUNY.

Has anyone else on this list done this? I'm particularly interested in how
people built critical mass in terms of faculty use. How did you get faculty
engaged with the site and then maintain their interest in using it?

Thanks,

David

I ended up writing a script to quiesce the database (even InnoDB, which
isn't reliably done with "FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK" like MyISAM is), and
an LVM snapshot which then got wrapped up into a compressed tarball. It
worked great - it yielded consistent snapshots and the database was only
locked for a handful of seconds at most.

We ran into a similar issue with the database locking for too long 
during backups.  I setup replication to a slave server and perform the 
backups on the slave.  It catches up with the master once the dumps have 
been completed by replaying the events in it's relay log.

We're also using hyperdb, but just to split the database into 11 smaller 
ones, so each individual database's files are easier to work with.
