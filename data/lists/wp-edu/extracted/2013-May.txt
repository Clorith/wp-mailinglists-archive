Message-ID: <CAP3hb2+btdSfcG5Y5CYfP4FPTMwgW1Ff2pcoj9K5km6DUVknMA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I've been setting up Job Manager (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/job-manager/) to run on
http://TahlequahSchools.org site. It's the most adequate plugin I've found
for what I want it to do; however, I'm still not too happy with it and was
wondering what others were using to list job openings?


Thanks,

Hi all, 
Have other Multisite administrators encountered the problem of users trying to embed content like Twitter widgets in their blogs, and not being able to because of the (understandable) restrictions WordPress places on embedded code (for any user who isn't a Network Admin)? What kinds of strategies do you have for dealing with this? 


Obviously, oEmbed meets most of our users' embedding needs just fine (though some indication that they need to use a URL rather than embed code would be helpful-- is anyone providing instructions or feedback within WP for this?). 


But we're looking for lightweight, sustainable ways to solve the Twitter widget problem since a lot of our users want these, and it's hardly user-friendly for us to tell them they have to ask a Network Admin to embed the widget for them, and then they can never open or edit that widget again or WordPress will strip the <script> tags and replace their tweets with a broken pile of Javascript. 


Right now we're looking at plugins specifically for Twitter (using a shortcode), but I'm interested in ideas that might work for the few other things not supported by oEmbed (plus I hate to add a plugin *just* for Twitter...). Has anyone else dealt with this? 


Thank you, 
Juliana Perry

Hi Juliana,

We run http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/unfiltered-mu/ without any
issues on our Multisite networks.

It hasn't been updated in a while, but Automattic is a co-author (and the
other two authors are well known too) and it works great for us.

You should be able to trust allowing embedding on your networks as long as
you know all users that can add/edit posts are part of your college
community - which most likely is true. Meaning you most likely don't have
open blog registration to anyone in the world to be able to create blogs.

Hope this helps!

Thanks!

Hi all,

A safer way of allowing specific services to be embedded is to write a
shortcode for each:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API

If it seems daunting, shortcodes are actually a good way to get into PHP.
Happy to answer questions or provide feedback on code off list.

Cheers,

Daniel

Subject: [wp-edu] Superadmins redirect to main page admin panel when

Message-ID: <8F11F3CB9AE456499BE50382F3EC8844042A11998A@w-sch-mb00.hcps.internal>

We are experiencing an issue that impacts any superadmin who manually types in the web address to access a blog dashboard who also makes a typo when manually typing in the URL. 
For example, if a superadmin (who has previously authenticated into blogname.edu) types in this address for a blog dashboard: 

http://blogname.edu/whaaaaaaaat/wp-admin/ 

then they are typing in a non-existent dashboard URL (the correct URL should be http://blogname.edu/what/wp-admin/). 

I thought that by typing in a URL to a non-existent site would load a file not found or 404 error page. However, no error page loads for superadmins in this case. Instead, the root (blogname.edu/wp-admin/) page loads and the URL with the typo remains listed in the web address bar, giving false information to the blog user. This resulted in our blog's homepage being accidentally edited.

Is this a default behavior in WordPress MultiSite, or is this due to some misconfiguration on our part?

Can anyone verify that this happens on their MultiSite install as well?

Anyone have any ideas how I could fix it?

Any help would be very much appreciated!

Sounds like something that could be solved in an htaccess configuration,
but that is over my head. I tried your situation on my MS install and got
the same problem.

Still searching for a solution as well.

I just tested this on my dev environment, and I got a 404 page as 
expected (WP 3.6 beta 3 multisite). Like Steve said, it looks like 
something related to your htaccess configuration.

Best,

Brian,

I think this is the default behavior for Multisite sites. We see it too.

I think this line in the .htaccess file tells apache to serve up the
admin, even if the first part of the URL doesn't exist:

RewriteRule ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(wp-(content|admin|includes).*) $1 [L]

However, it hasn't been a problem for us.

For what it's worth, we have an "editor login" link at the bottom of
our pages, so our users do not type in the URLs at all.

-Bill

It happens on ours as well, and I've also made inadvertent changes to the main site when I mistyped the path of a specific site without realizing it.

The solution, it seems to me, would be a check when the request is parsed by PHP to see if a site exists that matches the first path component. Based on Gerlando's comment, I thought it may have been added between 3.5 and 3.6 -- but I did a quick multisite install using 3.6 beta 3 just now with neither bells nor whistles, and the problem persists.

Gerlando, do you have a subdomain or subdirectory setup?

In my case I have a subdomain setup. Now that I think about it, the 404 
that I'm getting could be related to one of the custom plugins that I 
have installed in there. I will do some further testing and let you know.

Coincidentally, I just read a blog post on "How To Redirect Nonexistent Blogs in WordPress Multisite" on WPMU.org. I haven't tried it, so I don't know if it will fix the superadmin problem.

>From http://wpmu.org/how-to-redirect-nonexistent-blogs-in-wordpress-multisite/
	Did you know that WordPress has a NOBLOGREDIRECT constant that you can use to customize the URL it redirects to for nonexistent blogs? Add this to your wp-config.php file and change the URL to wherever you want to send your visitors.
define('NOBLOGREDIRECT', 'http://example.com');

I put "define('NOBLOGREDIRECT', 'http://example.com');" into the config file for my barebones installation. http://localhost/noblog took me to example.com, but http://localhost/noblog/wp-admin/ still took me to the dashboard of the main site. 

Gerlando, my guess is that your 404 is correct as the RewriteRule Bill pointed to won't have the same effect for subdomain installations as it will for subdirectory installation. I haven't really poked around the source much, but, if that's the case, I don't understand why it wouldn't checks to see if the requested blog exists in either case.

We are trying to embed a Storify item into our self-hosted WordPress

Has anyone else used this plugin? Any suggestions?

Any chance you have an Ad Blocker on in your browser? Try a different browser to see if it makes a difference.

Would it be possible to temporarily switch to a default theme to see if there are any conflicts? Do you have a local version to test it on? Tried deactivating other plugins?
