We work with shibboleth as well; I know we had to drop the "." from our
usernames. I'll contact you off list.

 

We work on a faculty sign-up basis; when a faculty member requests a
site for a class or program, we pre-create the userID's in WP which
match what gets converted from shibboleth; then the student/faculty
member is able to log in. Those without corresponding UIDs in WP get
directed to a special "you don't have access to this resource" page
after they log in through shibboleth.

Subject: [wp-edu] New Users Signup Workflow - Shibboleth

 

Hey All,  

 

I am hoping to garner some ideas from what other Universities are doing
for the sign-up process for new users on their wordpress instances.  

 

In the past we have been using the Shibboleth plugin to authenticate new
users: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shibboleth/

 

Signups are disabled on the site.  All users have to use the campus ID
to log in the first time.  Since they use shibboleth there is no need
for a signup.  After they log in the first time then can go to the
signup page (new sites are allowed for existing users). 

 

Well, for us apparently 3.2 has broken the plugin, at least on our
instance.  I have contacted the developers but not sure if/when they are
going to update.  

 

When they authenticate and go back to the site it just goes blank.  I
have tried troubleshooting.  Current users can still log in.  But new
users go to a blank screen.  Debugging gives this error: Catchable fatal
error: Object of class WP_Error could not be converted to string in
/home/html/web-dev.unc.edu/html/wp-includes/formatting.php on line 2829

 

I have googled and tried lots of solutions, but nothing is working so
far, so I am looking to see if anyone out there has any ideas on a fix
(or an updated shibboleth plugin they are using) or other workflow
ideas?  I am also just curious what others are using for signing up new
users on their campus. 

 

Thanks for any advice, tips you can offer.

Hello all,

I see a number of plugins that supposedly give users the ability to provide paragraph level commenting on post/page content. Has anyone here installed a feature like this? If so, which plugin, pros/cons.

Thanks,

I've used both digress.it and CommentPress in courses. I'm
experimenting with another structure (though it is in Drupal).

digress.it was a mess, I'm afraid. I tried it once and it was a mess
on the UI. On the second go-round it just slowed to a crawl as the
total number of comments increased. It was fine on testing, it was
only under the load of a course that it died. It may have done away
with this issue, twice bitten is enough for me.

I've used CommentPress for several semesters now, and convinced
several others to do the same. Students love it, it's a great way to
teach. I use threaded comments.

The single biggest problem with CommentPress is that it's difficult
for students to know when people have replied to them on a document,
at least for the longish documents I use. You can set up email
notifications (and I have) but this only tells  you that someone has
commented on your page--not on what paragraph. That's not targeted
enough. I haven't gotten around to writing a plugin that does
"CommentPress notifications," but as I said, I'll probably go to a
Drupal-based system (using a javascript annotation frameword:
https://github.com/nickstenning/annotator) instead.

The second issue is it's a pain to theme. But this doesn't
particularly bother me.

Best,

Alex

Hi Alex,

It'd give Digress.it another shot. It's improved considerable in the last
few releases. I am also working on a new version that comes with a variety
of themes and a lot more customizable.

Interesting. I'd never thought of that. I'll see if there's something  
that can be quickly implemented.

The latest version on Github is properly child-theme aware.

Subject: [wp-edu] Student Usernames and Privacy
Message-ID: <CAJzCqShomKj82OWyryvFUA1xnFqvOVH+ryV6bMQgnDsSKJp+=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Summary: If you were to create accounts for students, what would you
use as a username?

The academic year is about to start (or may have already started, for
some of you) so we?re probably all hard at work with preparations.

As a teacher, my preparation has more to do with the material than
with logistical issues. But I?d like to use WordPress to supplement
Moodle, as a kind of pilot project.
For multiple reasons, privacy is a major concern, at my university. So
I need to ensure that student information is as hidden as possible.

Over a year ago, I tried getting students to register on a BuddyPress
site I created. Didn?t really work, as very few students ever signed
up and many found the registration process confusing. This year,
solving these ?onboarding? issues is a priority.

I?ll be teaching four courses and should have a total of 300 students.
Some changes in enrolment occur during the first two weeks of a
semester, but it?s rather manageable.

Since I?m ?just? a teacher, I don?t have a way to authenticate
students using their university credentials. But I do get CSV rosters
with some info about students:
* Student ID
* Last Name
* First Name
* Phone Number
* Email
* University username (?netname?)
* Major
* Registration Date

What I was thinking of doing is create a WordPress account for each
student using the ?Import Users from CSV? plugin and invite each of
them to courseware groups using the ?Invite Anyone? plugin. Doing some
tests, it seems to work as a way to bypass the registration process.

An issue, though, is what username to use. Since they?re used for
slugs and ?@mentions?, BuddyPress usernames are rather public, even
with plugins to hide them. The info I?m given is supposed to remain
private. Since usernames can?t be changed (easily) and since I?m
assigning them myself, I?m not really sure how to go at it.

* One thing I could do is get all students to send me a choice of
usernames. A bit convoluted, and it delays the whole process until I
get to meet with students and explain the whole thing. I can do this
through Moodle, but it still might require that I discuss things with
students.
* Using arbitrary numbers would solve most of these issues. But it?d
make the whole thing quite impersonal and I?m wary of assigning
numbers to students. It kind of defeats the purpose of having a
?social? site for my courses. (Since I teach sociology, these things
are important.)
* Creating usernames using their first and last name could make sense.
It?s common enough a practice. But it?s a bit like the arbitrary
number case in that it makes thing more impersonal. Also, I might need
to give a way for some students to change their username, as full
names are considered a potential privacy concern. Although, with the
WPVN Username Changer plugin, that?s not much of an issue.

Thoughts?

Hey Alex,
that's an interesting question.

username (be that Y! or Gmail, or even better if it's the University
mail server).

What about the set-up you are looking for, maybe you will give another
try to BuddyPress + Courseware. This summer I added a bunch of features
that should solve a lot of usability issues, like:
* Handbook/Tree organised lectures
* A bookmarking tool
* Breadcrumbs
* Icons, progress indicator, simplified UI
* Quizzes/Tests with auto-grading for assignments component
* Better editing integration: zen-mode and all that jazz
* Improved security for uploads and responses
* A bunch of other stuff...

Hope this helps.

To me, it seems obvious to use their netname. At my alma mater, the netname
was also the local part of the University email address. It was public,
unique, and couldn't be changed unless a request went through to the IT
department for cases of marriage, etc. It was set by the student upon
enrollment, but I know a number of schools that use a name or initials +
some X-digit randomness (or graduation year, etc.).

Changing a username after the fact, FWIW, is not particularly difficult --
assuming you don't care about mentions etc., you just need to change the DB
row. If you're using an object cache backend (which I would hope you are),
you'll also want to ensure you flush the various user cache groups for the
corresponding user.

Another side note: Unfortunately, BuddyPress often uses user_login (the
actual login) instead of user_nicename (the slug that would appear in
mentions or URLs). I know BP 1.3 does include some fixes here, but I'm not
sure if it's entirely addressed, or if there are any misuses in core. But,
hypothetically, it's probably possible to hide the user_login by having a
separate user_nicename.

Cheers,
Nacin
