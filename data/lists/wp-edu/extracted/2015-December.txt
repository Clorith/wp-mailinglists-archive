Subject: [wp-edu] Network/multi-site search?
Message-ID: <bca115bc6de5171ac1e0873a96a6b860@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone have a full ?global? search operational within their Wordpress
network? If so, can you share, and what plugin are you using?



In my case it needs to be an internal search, not an approximation such as
a Google advanced search ?site:domain.xyz.edu your search here? ? because
some of our sub-sites have their own domains (somethingelse.xyz.edu).



I would also love to see content categorization (site, post, page, image)
but that might be asking too much.

I use WordPress MU Sitewide Tags Pages (
https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mu-sitewide-tags/) which, despite
it's name, does what you need.
It works by copying every post (and optional pages too) to a designated
"tags" sub-site as it is published/updated.

I have set it up as search.example.com on one client site and have a
"global" search form on all sites which submits to this search site. Thus
doing an ordinary WP search on a site which contains all posts.

In our case we limit the number of posts to a total of 50,000 latest posts
from all sites, just for performance reasons. We feel that's enough.

Everything is still findable on the original sites, of course.

We use a custom results display so we can distinguish between different
types of content.

You have control over which meta data gets duplicated, so if you have some
customised meta data that could also be copied over and used in the search.


Hope that helps,



Best regards,

Mike
