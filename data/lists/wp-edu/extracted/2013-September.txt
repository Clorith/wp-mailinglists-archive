Hi Folks,

We have been hosting WP Multisite (for course blogs and as a blog supplement to our program websites) for a few years, with mixed results. Our community (users) love the flexibility of WP, but it has proven to be an unexpected support burden for IT...it seems that all of our website/network hacks have been introduced via WP. 

I haven't seen the topic addressed by this group, so it appears our experience is isolated, which would lead me to suspect we are missing some simple safe-guards.  Have any of your institutions dealt with WP-related security issues?  Have you found any successful, secure configurations, and if so, would you be willing to share your experiences with us?  WP is proving to be such a valuable tool...

If so, I will bring our Networks and Systems folks into the conversation, as they could answer specific questions related to our configuration and protocols.

Many thanks in advance!

Best,
Leslie

It would help to know more about the hacks you are seeing. Is it via plugins?

    
      


    We put wp-admin behind a firewall. You have to be on campus or using VPN to log into WordPress. It's a pain at times, but keeps certain malicious people out.

Geez - I have had ZERO infections via WordPress in 4 years.

Plugins:

Wordfence Security
WP Firewall 2
Secure WordPress
WP Secure Scan
WordPress HTTPS
WP Ban

Best Practice:

NO accounts named "admin"
htaccess file in wp-admin
NO default table prefixes in wp-config, such as "wp_". Change it to "wp_xRwFG_" or whatever.
original salt data in wp-config: https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/
Secure high quality passwords
Updated malware scans on user devices
Gravity Forms used on all forms, with CAPTCHA
SFTP on FTP accounts

Occasionally check on Sucuri.net. If you want to be on top of it, subscribe to their scan service.

There are other hardening plugins out there.

- Steve

I receive a lot of security alerts on wp.  I do have a Admin user name to
get into the dashboard do you think this may be causing the problem.  I
thought you need to create a admin user name.

thanks
have a great day

 Believe it or not, managing wordpress security, backups, the right
plugins that do not clash AND  production, staging and dev environments
can be a lot. 
I am considering moving our stuff to wp-engine.com to turn this stuff over
to them.  What should I consider?

1 ? Security alerts are good thing. It means the hardening strategies are actually working. I get TONS of alerts from my firewall ? all of which report that the robotic efforts of hackers are being repelled. Security alerts do not mean WP is "bad" for security. Your domain will be hacked no matter which platform you use, or even if you use plain HTML. There are certain vulnerabilities in WP that hackers know about, but these are accounted for in the hardening plugins I mentioned.

2 ? You do not need a username named "admin". It happens to be the default username WP gives on install, but NEVER use it. Any user can be given Administrator privileges. This is how you solve your problem (assuming you are "admin"):

  *   In your "admin"user acct, change the email address to something different (doesn't matter ? it's going to be deleted)
  *   Create a new user with "admin's" old email address.
  *   Delete the "admin" user and ascribe all of "admin's" posts/pages to the new user.

That's it.

Use Backup Buddy and WP db Manager for your backups. Automated.

Set your security plugins, follow best practices for configuration and
keep them updated. Very low maintenance.

Prior to launch, be sure to put the website into DUBUG mode to see which
plugins are causing errors or that have deprecated terms in them. Fix the
problems or find alternative plugins.

NEVER use anything but premium themes from known developers that update
their themes periodically.

Never do design/development work from master themes - always make a child
theme so you can apply master theme updates without deleting your
customizations.

Keep local versions of your sites available for testing major plugin
updates. Unless there is a significant security vulnerability (like a
timthumb.php kind of thing) or a major capability update, there is no rush
to update plugins that work cleanly. NextGen Gallery 2.x has weird bugs,
so I use the last stable version before the major update (1.9). No biggie.

Once these are set, these issues shouldn't bother you day-to-day.

Still, if you have a gazillion other responsibilities, outsourcing it all
might be a good thing, provided you can still hack at your code to make
adjustments.

- Steve

Hello --

I need help with some custom code for my WordPress site. I have a site that has 2 multimedia post types:
$media_type = 'audio';
$media_type = 'video';
and the site should pull the youtube thumbnail for the 'video' type and the post thumbnail for the 'audio' type, however, there isn't any if/else statement to distinguish between the two types for what image to use (this was built by someone else and I'm trying to fix it).

I'm not sure (a.) if I should have the function inside functions.php do this or if (b.) it should be at the page template level.

This is what I have in functions.php -- which tells WP to get one thing for 'video' but doesn't tell it what to do for 'audio'

function abc_media_thumbnail() { ?>
<div class="thumb">
 <!-- RUN TIME, CAST, etc... -->
 <a>">
   <?php $media_type = 'video';
       get_youtube_thumbnail(get_field('media_url'));
       $runtime = get_field('length');
   ?>
 </a>

 <?php if (!empty($runtime)): ?>
  <div class="runtime"><?php echo $runtime; ?></div>
 <?php endif; ?>
 <div class='media-info'>
   <p class='title'><a>"> <?php the_title(); ?></a></p>
   <p class="date grayed"><?php the_time('F j, Y'); ?></p>
 </div>
</div>
<?php
}

This is what the page template has:

<?php get_header();
$url = get_bloginfo('url'); ?>

<div id="content">
  <?php if ( have_posts() ) while ( have_posts() ): the_post(); ?>
 <?php
  $media_terms = get_the_terms($post->ID, 'media-type');

  if (is_array($media_terms)) {
  $media_type = array_pop($media_terms);
  }
 ?>

 <?php if (isset($media_type)): ?>
   <div class="labels">
     <a>slug; ?>"><?php echo $media_type->name; ?></a>
   </div>
   <div id="media" class="clearfix">
     <?php
       if ($media_type->slug == 'video') {
         abc_video_post();
       } else {
         abc_audio_post();
       }
     ?>
   </div>
 <?php endif; ?>
  <?php endwhile;
    wp_reset_postdata();
  ?>

  <?php if (isset($media_type)): ?>
 <h2 class="recent">Recently Featured</h2>
 <?php
   $args = array(
     'posts_per_page' => 4,
     'post__not_in' => array($post->ID),
     'tax_query' => array(
       array(
         'taxonomy' => 'media-type',
         'field' => 'slug',
         'terms' => $media_type->slug
       )
     )
   );
   $recent_posts = new WP_Query( $args );
   if ( $recent_posts->have_posts() ) while ( $recent_posts->have_posts() ): $recent_posts->the_post();
     abc_media_thumbnail();
   endwhile; ?>
  <?php endif; ?>
</div>
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
<?php get_footer(); ?>

Any help is much appreciated!

Sorry I can't help, but you might also get a good response from Stackexchange.com's wordpress thread.

http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/

That way, your answer will be preserved for the rest of the WP community to draw from as well ? not just the weasels in this group  ;-)

Thx ? Steve

Kim ? It sounds like you'd be better off using Wordpress' built-in "post format" functionality.  http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats

To turn it on add this line to your functions.php file: add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'video', 'audio' ) );

Then you can use conditionals to display each post format type differently in the single.php file by either doing the layout there or calling other template files i.e.


if ( has_post_format( 'video' )) {
  echo 'this is the video format'; //this is how I want it displayed ORget_template_part( 'content', 'video' ); //This would call the content-video.php file

}

Hi. I am a bit new to this list but am writing to discuss methods of
maintaining the system including its themes and plugins.

We currently have everything (core, plugins, themes and local solutions)
installed in one subversion repository of our own. However, upon
discovering that Wordpress maintains its code in subversion, I have been
considering rebuilding our system using the WP Subversion repos and using
svn:externals to manage plugins and themes. reference:
http://scott.yang.id.au/2006/04/svnexternal-wordpress-plugins/

The one problem I have seen in this model is that (so far) when I switch WP
versions, the WP svn externals file in wp-contents/plugins (which
references Akismet) conflicts with my externals file and it is difficult to
manage that conflict. It generally seems like a great way to go but it is a
lot of work to rebuild the whole system in this way.

Along the lines of ongoing maintenance, there is the question of whether to
use JetPack or not and I also just discovered a neat wordpress command-line
interface app at http://wp-cli.org/ and wonder if anyone out there has been
using it.

My skills may not be on-pr with what you are asking, but I have generally behaved conservatively about making certain updates (themes, plugins, core?) until I have tested them out in one form or another. I had some major problems with the NextGen Gallery major 2.0 update and had to revert back to 1.9, for example.

So if your plan involves tying into updates in a way that manages these tasks automatically, then you may run into trouble.

I apologize if I am misstating what I think your proposed configuration is intended to do, but just in case it does involved automating update processes, this is a word from the trenches.

Thx ? Steve

However, upon discovering that Wordpress maintains its code in subversion, I have been considering rebuilding our system using the WP Subversion repos and using svn:externals to manage plugins and themes. reference: http://scott.yang.id.au/2006/04/svnexternal-wordpress-plugins/

The one problem I have seen in this model is that (so far) when I switch WP versions, the WP svn externals file in wp-contents/plugins (which references Akismet) conflicts with my externals file and it is difficult to manage that conflict. It generally seems like a great way to go but it is a lot of work to rebuild the whole system in this way.

Along the lines of ongoing maintenance, there is the question of whether to use JetPack or not and I also just discovered a neat wordpress command-line interface app at http://wp-cli.org/ and wonder if anyone out there has been using it.

@Timothy, I used to use wp-cli on a previous server that had no control
panel and did not want to use the automatic upgrade in the backend. Never
had any problems with it and it accomplished what I needed at the time.

We're a git shop, so we import the SVN repos into git and then go from there. In git we use a main repo for the wordpress code, plus submodules for individual plugins and themes. It required some work to get the import set up, but we found it works very well for our purposes (especially since all of our custom code and themes is managed in git as well). It'd be happy to put you in touch with our git guru if you'd like to know more.

We found the CLI to be very limited, but then again, we were hoping for something along the lines of Drupal's drush.

To add to this, we manage our Wordpress sites in Git as well. We include Wordpress's official Git repo (which syncs against their SVN every 15 minutes) as a submodule in our projects, referencing their version tags.

Here's the Wordpress git repository: https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress

Interesting...I thought more folks would be using SVN but it seems that
many use WP's built-in updater and several use Git. Neat. I/we have been
thinking of switching from SVN to Git. Perhaps this rebuild of the dev
server is the time to get on with it.

Thanks all for the feedback.

We forked the Wordpress Skeleton project by Mark Jaquith (one of Wordpress's lead developers) and created our own skeleton project based on it, which we then fork for every new site we develop.

Here's Mark's skeleton: https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Skeleton
