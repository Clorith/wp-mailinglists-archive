Subject: [wp-edu] Collecting data for WPCampus WordPress edu survey
Message-ID: <CANutU2644GBkVJF_P_TNUCXqGe6rn+w+LdS7eXz7Gr-oOrS8Mw@mail.gmail.com>

The Educational Institution WordPress Survey is NOW OPEN:
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WPC2016

This survey is an initiative of WPCampus <https://2016.wpcampus.org/>, an
education-focused, non-profit conference. The goal is to learn more about
how schools of all sizes use WordPress and manage their website
development.

The survey takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. You can count on complete
confidentiality for your responses.

Data collected from the survey will be published in a series of reports on
the state of WordPress in public schools and higher education.

As part of the organizing team and a sponsor of the conference, we
appreciate your participation and welcome any questions you may have.

Thank you,

Jen Jamar
