Subject: [wp-edu] Automate Site Creation Process
Message-ID: <CAL7vF9AXzQ9zDXrse_B3dHPJQ+J-6QNUdE9uJGn+v9G2YSr1hw@mail.gmail.com>

We are running a WordPress multisite and would like to automate the
creation of sites. Our goal is to limit who can create a site while still
allowing the user to connect to the wp-signup.php form for automated site
registration. We've configured our system so that users who have a
university email address will be able to log into the system, and once
logged in, create sites. However, our campus policy limits who on the
campus can get a WordPress site in our network.

Has anyone set up this type of system, and do you have any suggestions for
how we can make it work? I am trying the WPMU DEV Pro Sites plugin, but
it's not really intended for this purpose and I'm worried it may cause
unwanted anomalies.

I appreciate any advice you can offer. FYI - I'm new at coding and our
budget is tight!

Thank you.
Laurie

Hi Laurie,

I think NYU is doing something similar. 

This approach might be relevant: https://2016.wpcampus.org/schedule/lightning-talks/extending-wp-signup-page-form-higher-ed-use-case/ <https://2016.wpcampus.org/schedule/lightning-talks/extending-wp-signup-page-form-higher-ed-use-case/> 

The slides and recording are posted.

Thanks,
Jennifer

Hi Laurie,

I manage the education and hosting services at WPMU DEV (and our sister
service, CampusPress). I agree, the Pro Sites plugin may not be designed
for this need. I'd be happy to chat about that. I know that for many of our
customers, we are able to leverage attributes in something like Active
Directory or Shibboleth to limit site creation to certain groups, like just
faculty/staff. Perhaps that might be useful for you?

Ronnie

Hi Ronnie.

Thank you for responding. I actually chatted with one of your WPMU DEV's
support folks this morning. Her name is Katya Tsihotska. She is going to
pursue this issue for me.

I don't think filtering our Active Directory for only certain users would
work well, as all our faculty, staff, and students have the same email
domain, and some users within all those roles would be eligible for one of
our WordPress sites.

I hope this makes sense.

Thank you.
Laurie

Hi Laurie,

This is Neel Shah from NYU. We do something similar to what you asked for and allow users to create sites based on their university affiliation. You can find an overview of it in the Jennifer sent. 

Feel free to reach out to me at shah.neel at nyu.edu if you have any questions. 

Best,
Neel
