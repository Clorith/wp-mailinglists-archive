Subject: [wp-edu] Automated site pruning?
Message-ID: <85F05EE0D1E7E1499CCFFE9E3DFDF43C12DC8CD1@SSVMEXDAG01MB03.tufts.ad.tufts.edu>

Hello wp-edu'ers,

Our multi-site instance of WordPress is self-serve. Meaning anyone with a Tufts login can create as many sites as they want. Of course people come and go but their sites stick around.

Has anyone come up with a clever way to automatically detect and prune out ghost sites?

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <CA12CBE4F4AC324FBE1668F44FF17FD6687CEE2B@EXCH2.darden.virginia.edu>

I would really like to know how many plugins each school has for the wordpress instances-especially if they are WPMU.  I added a new column to the spread sheet: http://bit.ly/12nblfc   Please add your numbers.

Message-ID: <CF225784.328F%skriloffn@darden.virginia.edu>

Can anyone suggest a good  wordpress MU plugin that will insert this google tag manager code in every one of my multi-user pages? http://cl.ly/text/1n43360g0l2K
I would like to just install one network activated plugin that affects all sites.

Nick

Hi Nick, 
We're using https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/global-footer-content (requires a wpmudev subscription, at least for the time it takes to get the plugin) to place Google Analytics code in our footer. You just need to make sure all of the themes on your multisite install include the call for footer.php (they certainly should, but we once had some questionable themes that were installed in the... carefree, enthusiastic early days of our install). This seems like it might work well for your tag manager, as well as anything else you need on all pages. 


Best, 
Juliana
