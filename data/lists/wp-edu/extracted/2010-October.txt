At Williams we have a local video server and wrote a simple short-code 
based plugin to allow people to embed videos (and other media) from 
there. We also encourage the use of youtube and other video services 
when possible.

Hi all;

We occasionally host them ourselves, depending on the nature of the
content.  Most of the times (and almost exclusively on our Wordpress
install) we have them upload to YouTube and then grab an embed code or use
Anarchy Media Plugin or, since WP3 came out they can just embed directly.

If you're looking for a simple media plugin Anarchy rocks.

James

From dkwhisle at uncc.edu  Fri Oct  8 16:45:45 2010

Subject: [wp-edu] Creation of Tables in a Post or Page in WordPress
Message-ID: <41438143A28B884D90CE5148683268B2020E04FD@EXEVS01.its.uncc.edu>

Got a question:   I've built a WordPress 3.01 multisite for all of the
Faculty/Staff in our Engineering College.

 

I've posted this question below and here at our main WP site:
http://coefs.uncc.edu/2010/10/no-table-support-in-wp-visual-editor-and-s
olutions/

 

I've been very impressed with Word Press in the 6 months or so since
I've "dove in" to it.

 

However, I was very surprised to find that the standard Visual Editor in
WP has no way to create a tables (IE: no Table widget in the toolbar, no
wizard, etc...) and even more surprised by the near silence on this
issue.

 

Several faculty noticed this as well (thus, I'm not the only one) and
you'd think having a Table Wizard on the toolbar would be standard fare
of an WYSIWYG editor these days (not to mention other formatting tools).

 

I kept thinking that we were somehow missing the boat and simply
overlooking the obvious.....  Especially when my Google searches didn't
find the answer - I thought I was just having a bad brain day.
Eventually I came to see that I was right - there simply was no built-in
method in WP to do tables in the Visual Editor.   I was stunned that WP,
as awesome as it is, didn't have this as part of the basic core.

 

Here's the options I've found in my research:

 

1.       Create the table in MS-Word, MS-Excel and then paste it into
the visual editor

 

2.       Write the HTML yourself, use an HTML wizard on a website, or
your favorite HTML editor (Dream Weaver, etc..) to generate the HTML,
then in the WP editor, switch to HTML mode and then cut-n-paste it into
your WP page/post.

 

3.       Use Microsoft Live Writer 2010
<http://explore.live.com/windows-live-write>  (free client-side windows
app) - as it has many fine features AND allows you to completely manage
your posts AND pages.  It also has it's one set of plug-ins (go here:
Windows Live Gallery <http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?pl=8> ), but
the standard install seems to do most of what you'll need.

 

4.       Find a WP Plug-in that provides the missing table feature (and
other formatting tools)

a.       WP Super Edit:  WordPress > WP Super Edit < Word Press Plug-ins
<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-edit/> 

b.      CKEditor:             WordPress > CKEditor For WordPress <
WordPress Plugins
<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ckeditor-for-wordpress/> 

c.       FolioPress:          WordPress > Foliopress WYSIWYG < WordPress
Plugins <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/foliopress-wysiwyg/> 

Live Writer Pros:   I've just installed Live Writer this morning and
have been testing it - and it looks pretty nice and seems to work well.
Has many nice formatting features and is similar to
http://scribefire.com <http://scribefire.com/>  (free popular browser
add-on for Fire Fox/Safari/Chrome).   But, is not as limiting as Scribe
Fire.   Scribe Fire does NOT have the table wizard NOR does it have the
ability to create or edit "Pages" - it can only do "Posts".   However,
Live Writer can do both.   And you can create new pages/posts off-line
and then publish them later (which might come in handy sometime).

 

Live Writer Cons:   It is yet another "app" that has to be
installed/managed/upgraded AND you'll have to teach people how to use it
(though it's not hard.... But you know how it is..)   Being a Microsoft
app, it might yet be inserting a lot of junk into each post/page that
you create (not sure if this is the case.... Just guessing on past
experience).     I did see a lot of positive reviews of it from WP
users, however, I think I may have stumbled across a complaint from
someone that later edited the "table" in the WP editor which had earlier
been created using Live Writer and it messed up the formatting.     It's
possible this was an issue with an earlier release of WP and/or with an
earlier release of Live Writer - so take this with a grain of salt -
you'll need to try that out and see if it really is an issue or not.
Oh, and one more Con for Live Writer.   You guessed it.  Being a
Microsoft product, it only runs on Windows XP/Windows 7.   So, the Mac
and Linux crowd get left out.  Not good.

 

WP Plug-ins:   I'm going to review/install/test the 3 plug-ins mentioned
above (the 1st is probably the best one) and see which one is the best
(if any).  

 

I want to find the optimal solution and if WP is working on adding more
formatting features to the standard Visual Editor, as the best option is
always to stick to the core product - the less plug-ins and/or other
ancillary software we have to utilize, the easier it is to administer
(less stuff to install/upgrade, less potential breakage when upgrading,
less potential security breaches, less training of the end-users,
etc...).

 

Please let me know if you have another other solutions that are proven
to work well and if you have tried any of these above (and which one you
recommend).

 

Thanks,

Dave

Hi Dave,

We've been using TinyMCE Advanced (plugin) to add the table buttons to the editor, in addition to a couple others (anchor and HR). It generally works perfectly but needs to be set up on each new site. I've also recently noticed that some buttons have disappeared, though - I imagine it's a conflict with another plugin. I'm very to interested to hear your thoughts on the other plugins you mentioned!

Best,
Helen

Helen,

 

I?ll be sure to keep everyone posted.    Regarding the plugin you?ve been using (TinyMCE Advanced), I saw it but am not pursuing it, since it?s not officially compatible with WP 3.x

 

It?s not been updated since 12/09 either, plus regarding whether it works in WP 3.x, 37 say yes, but 9 say it?s broken.     



I try to avoid any plugins that aren?t officially compatible with the release I?m using and/or haven?t been updated within the last 6 months (if WP has been upgraded in that timeframe).

 

Dave

Hi Dave,

 

There is a plugin that handles the creation and managing of html tables.   http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-table-reloaded/.

Helen,

 

I?ll be sure to keep everyone posted.    Regarding the plugin you?ve been using (TinyMCE Advanced), I saw it but am not pursuing it, since it?s not officially compatible with WP 3.x

 

It?s not been updated since 12/09 either, plus regarding whether it works in WP 3.x, 37 say yes, but 9 say it?s broken.     

I try to avoid any plugins that aren?t officially compatible with the release I?m using and/or haven?t been updated within the last 6 months (if WP has been upgraded in that timeframe).

 

Dave

Hi Dave,

 

We've been using TinyMCE Advanced (plugin) to add the table buttons to the editor, in addition to a couple others (anchor and HR). It generally works perfectly but needs to be set up on each new site. I've also recently noticed that some buttons have disappeared, though - I imagine it's a conflict with another plugin. I'm very to interested to hear your thoughts on the other plugins you mentioned!

 

Best,

Helen

Got a question:   I?ve built a WordPress 3.01 multisite for all of the Faculty/Staff in our Engineering College.

 

I?ve posted this question below and here at our main WP site:    http://coefs.uncc.edu/2010/10/no-table-support-in-wp-visual-editor-and-solutions/

 

I?ve been very impressed with Word Press in the 6 months or so since I?ve ?dove in? to it.

 

However, I was very surprised to find that the standard Visual Editor in WP has no way to create a tables (IE: no Table widget in the toolbar, no wizard, etc?) and even more surprised by the near silence on this issue.

 

Several faculty noticed this as well (thus, I?m not the only one) and you?d think having a Table Wizard on the toolbar would be standard fare of an WYSIWYG editor these days (not to mention other formatting tools).

 

I kept thinking that we were somehow missing the boat and simply overlooking the obvious?..  Especially when my Google searches didn?t find the answer ? I thought I was just having a bad brain day.   Eventually I came to see that I was right ? there simply was no built-in method in WP to do tables in the Visual Editor.   I was stunned that WP, as awesome as it is, didn?t have this as part of the basic core.

 

Here?s the options I?ve found in my research:

 

1.       Create the table in MS-Word, MS-Excel and then paste it into the visual editor

 

2.       Write the HTML yourself, use an HTML wizard on a website, or your favorite HTML editor (Dream Weaver, etc..) to generate the HTML, then in the WP editor, switch to HTML mode and then cut-n-paste it into your WP page/post.

 

3.       Use Microsoft <http://explore.live.com/windows-live-write>  Live Writer 2010 (free client-side windows app) ? as it has many fine features AND allows you to completely manage your posts AND pages.  It also has it's one set of plug-ins (go here:  Windows Live Gallery <http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?pl=8> ), but the standard install seems to do most of what you'll need.

 

4.       Find a WP Plug-in that provides the missing table feature (and other formatting tools)

a.       WP Super Edit:  WordPress ? WP Super <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-edit/>  Edit ? Word Press Plug-ins

b.      CKEditor:             WordPress ? <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ckeditor-for-wordpress/>  CKEditor For WordPress ? WordPress Plugins

c.       FolioPress:          WordPress ? <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/foliopress-wysiwyg/>  Foliopress WYSIWYG ? WordPress Plugins

Live Writer Pros:   I?ve just installed Live Writer this morning and have been testing it ? and it looks pretty nice and seems to work well.    Has many nice formatting features and is similar to http://scribefire.com (free popular browser add-on for Fire Fox/Safari/Chrome).   But, is not as limiting as Scribe Fire.   Scribe Fire does NOT have the table wizard NOR does it have the ability to create or edit ?Pages? ? it can only do ?Posts?.   However, Live Writer can do both.   And you can create new pages/posts off-line and then publish them later (which might come in handy sometime).

 

Live Writer Cons:   It is yet another ?app? that has to be installed/managed/upgraded AND you?ll have to teach people how to use it (though it?s not hard?. But you know how it is..)   Being a Microsoft app, it might yet be inserting a lot of junk into each post/page that you create (not sure if this is the case?. Just guessing on past experience).     I did see a lot of positive reviews of it from WP users, however, I think I may have stumbled across a complaint from someone that later edited the ?table? in the WP editor which had earlier been created using Live Writer and it messed up the formatting.     It?s possible this was an issue with an earlier release of WP and/or with an earlier release of Live Writer ? so take this with a grain of salt ? you?ll need to try that out and see if it really is an issue or not.   Oh, and one more Con for Live Writer.   You guessed it.  Being a Microsoft product, it only runs on Windows XP/Windows 7.   So, the Mac and Linux crowd get left out.  Not good.

 

WP Plug-ins:   I?m going to review/install/test the 3 plug-ins mentioned above (the 1st is probably the best one) and see which one is the best (if any).  

 

I want to find the optimal solution and if WP is working on adding more formatting features to the standard Visual Editor, as the best option is always to stick to the core product ? the less plug-ins and/or other ancillary software we have to utilize, the easier it is to administer (less stuff to install/upgrade, less potential breakage when upgrading, less potential security breaches, less training of the end-users, etc?).

 

Please let me know if you have another other solutions that are proven to work well and if you have tried any of these above (and which one you recommend).

 

Thanks,

Dave

Dave - Indeed, that has been my concern with many plugins, but up until the
recent breakage, TinyMCE Advanced was working wonderfully despite not having
been updated. I will have to check out WP Super Edit as well, though.

Loren, I've been eyeing that table plugin - do you have any experience with
it?

I've had great success with WP Table Reloaded in several of my  
projects.  You may not enjoy it as much as it has to be used in its  
own menu and then added via shortcode to a post or page and from the  
WYSIWYG editor.

Hi Helen,

I have only installed it on a development site so far - so I have not really given it much of a work out.  What I liked was that my users could use tables without ever having to think about html.

Dave - Indeed, that has been my concern with many plugins, but up until the recent breakage, TinyMCE Advanced was working wonderfully despite not having been updated. I will have to check out WP Super Edit as well, though.

 

Loren, I've been eyeing that table plugin - do you have any experience with it?

Hi Dave,

 

There is a plugin that handles the creation and managing of html tables.   http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-table-reloaded/.

Helen,

 

I?ll be sure to keep everyone posted.    Regarding the plugin you?ve been using (TinyMCE Advanced), I saw it but am not pursuing it, since it?s not officially compatible with WP 3.x

 

It?s not been updated since 12/09 either, plus regarding whether it works in WP 3.x, 37 say yes, but 9 say it?s broken.     

I try to avoid any plugins that aren?t officially compatible with the release I?m using and/or haven?t been updated within the last 6 months (if WP has been upgraded in that timeframe).

 

Dave

Hi Dave,

 

We've been using TinyMCE Advanced (plugin) to add the table buttons to the editor, in addition to a couple others (anchor and HR). It generally works perfectly but needs to be set up on each new site. I've also recently noticed that some buttons have disappeared, though - I imagine it's a conflict with another plugin. I'm very to interested to hear your thoughts on the other plugins you mentioned!

 

Best,

Helen

Got a question:   I?ve built a WordPress 3.01 multisite for all of the Faculty/Staff in our Engineering College.

 

I?ve posted this question below and here at our main WP site:    http://coefs.uncc.edu/2010/10/no-table-support-in-wp-visual-editor-and-solutions/

 

I?ve been very impressed with Word Press in the 6 months or so since I?ve ?dove in? to it.

 

However, I was very surprised to find that the standard Visual Editor in WP has no way to create a tables (IE: no Table widget in the toolbar, no wizard, etc?) and even more surprised by the near silence on this issue.

 

Several faculty noticed this as well (thus, I?m not the only one) and you?d think having a Table Wizard on the toolbar would be standard fare of an WYSIWYG editor these days (not to mention other formatting tools).

 

I kept thinking that we were somehow missing the boat and simply overlooking the obvious?..  Especially when my Google searches didn?t find the answer ? I thought I was just having a bad brain day.   Eventually I came to see that I was right ? there simply was no built-in method in WP to do tables in the Visual Editor.   I was stunned that WP, as awesome as it is, didn?t have this as part of the basic core.

 

Here?s the options I?ve found in my research:

 

1.       Create the table in MS-Word, MS-Excel and then paste it into the visual editor

 

2.       Write the HTML yourself, use an HTML wizard on a website, or your favorite HTML editor (Dream Weaver, etc..) to generate the HTML, then in the WP editor, switch to HTML mode and then cut-n-paste it into your WP page/post.

 

3.       Use Microsoft <http://explore.live.com/windows-live-write>  Live Writer 2010 (free client-side windows app) ? as it has many fine features AND allows you to completely manage your posts AND pages.  It also has it's one set of plug-ins (go here:  Windows Live <http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?pl=8>  Gallery), but the standard install seems to do most of what you'll need.

 

4.       Find a WP Plug-in that provides the missing table feature (and other formatting tools)

a.       WP Super Edit:  WordPress <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-edit/>  ? WP Super Edit ? Word Press Plug-ins

b.      CKEditor:             WordPress ? CKEditor For WordPress ? WordPress Plugins <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ckeditor-for-wordpress/> 

c.       FolioPress:          WordPress <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/foliopress-wysiwyg/>  ? Foliopress WYSIWYG ? WordPress Plugins

Live Writer Pros:   I?ve just installed Live Writer this morning and have been testing it ? and it looks pretty nice and seems to work well.    Has many nice formatting features and is similar to http://scribefire.com (free popular browser add-on for Fire Fox/Safari/Chrome).   But, is not as limiting as Scribe Fire.   Scribe Fire does NOT have the table wizard NOR does it have the ability to create or edit ?Pages? ? it can only do ?Posts?.   However, Live Writer can do both.   And you can create new pages/posts off-line and then publish them later (which might come in handy sometime).

 

Live Writer Cons:   It is yet another ?app? that has to be installed/managed/upgraded AND you?ll have to teach people how to use it (though it?s not hard?. But you know how it is..)   Being a Microsoft app, it might yet be inserting a lot of junk into each post/page that you create (not sure if this is the case?. Just guessing on past experience).     I did see a lot of positive reviews of it from WP users, however, I think I may have stumbled across a complaint from someone that later edited the ?table? in the WP editor which had earlier been created using Live Writer and it messed up the formatting.     It?s possible this was an issue with an earlier release of WP and/or with an earlier release of Live Writer ? so take this with a grain of salt ? you?ll need to try that out and see if it really is an issue or not.   Oh, and one more Con for Live Writer.   You guessed it.  Being a Microsoft product, it only runs on Windows XP/Windows 7.   So, the Mac and Linux crowd get left out.  Not good.

 

WP Plug-ins:   I?m going to review/install/test the 3 plug-ins mentioned above (the 1st is probably the best one) and see which one is the best (if any).  

 

I want to find the optimal solution and if WP is working on adding more formatting features to the standard Visual Editor, as the best option is always to stick to the core product ? the less plug-ins and/or other ancillary software we have to utilize, the easier it is to administer (less stuff to install/upgrade, less potential breakage when upgrading, less potential security breaches, less training of the end-users, etc?).

 

Please let me know if you have another other solutions that are proven to work well and if you have tried any of these above (and which one you recommend).

 

Thanks,

Dave

another vote for Tiny MCE advanced.  It works great for us 3.01.  There are some problems with the insert video function, but for tables it's a perfect solution.  We have a relatively large (over 1500 sites) multi-site environment.

Loren,

 

Thanks for the suggestion to try WP-Table-Reloaded, but I had seen that
one previously and opted not to try it.   

I saw that this plugin is pretty popular and so thought it  might work
for me.   However...... not didn't seem to be optimal for what I had in
mind (though I could be wrong).

 

Here's my reasoning:   It seems to suggest that it stores each "table"
that you create ( I guess for re-use purposes) and then you reference
that table in your post/page using a special shortcode.   

Am I correct in this?    If so, that might work for some situations, but
I'm thinking that most times you'd want the actual content in the table
to be stored in the actual post/page and not simply hitting a reference
to where it's stored somewhere else.   What if someone removes the
actual table data in the "plugin" backend - or deinstalled the plugin
(or it stops working due to a upgrade or the plugin dev. Stops...)

 

What I'm pursuing is simply a way to generate the html needed for
formatting in the front-end editor - thus, even if the editor plugin I
use to do this function "goes away", breaks, or I deinstall it, the
content in the page/post is not dependent on it - since it's just
standard HTML.     

 

Thanks,

 

Dave

Thanks for the feedback.   Yes, it will probably do the trick.   Good to
know that some multi-site WP 3.0 sites are using it.     However, anyone
do a head-to-head comparison of it against others (WP Super Edit or
others)?

Message-ID: <4CB7C525.4050006@automattic.com>

Hi everyone. Just thought I'd remind people that WordCamp NYC is this 
weekend in Manhattan at Baruch College (CUNY), and will have an academic 
track dedicated to using WordPress (and BuddyPress) in academic 
settings. The schedule is posted at 
http://2010.nyc.wordcamp.org/schedule/ and tickets for the two-day 
conference are only $30. Given the cheap bus fares (and normal, 
affordable trains), people from all over the northeast tend to come, 
especially from the Boston-D.C. corridor.

Anyway, it's going to be awesome, so I hope someone of you are able to 
make it.

Video of the sessions will be posted at wordpress.tv after the event is 
over.

If you want to go to Word Camp NYC this weekend and don't have a
ticket yet, I'll sell you mine for $20, ($10 off).  I can't attend and
don't want it to go to waste.  I have to do this quickly, as they'll
be printing out the badges today.

Thanks!

Hi everyone. Just thought I'd remind people that WordCamp NYC is this 
weekend in Manhattan at Baruch College (CUNY), and will have an academic 
track dedicated to using WordPress (and BuddyPress) in academic 
settings. The schedule is posted at 
http://2010.nyc.wordcamp.org/schedule/ and tickets for the two-day 
conference are only $30. Given the cheap bus fares (and normal, 
affordable trains), people from all over the northeast tend to come, 
especially from the Boston-D.C. corridor.

Anyway, it's going to be awesome, so I hope someone of you are able to 
make it.

Video of the sessions will be posted at wordpress.tv after the event is 
over.

Subject: [wp-edu] Importing custom taxonomies
Message-ID: <948C4C48-BE62-4B9B-98BA-025E698806AF@thecompass.com>

Has anyone imported hierarchical custom taxonomies from external files?

I'm loving the power of splitting up my multi-faceted single category list into several custom taxonomies and then managing them with GD Custom Posts and Taxonomies. However, I'd rather not recreate them manually. (And, CSV Importer appears to not be working with custom taxonomies.)

I've done some searching for answers but may not be using the correct terms. Any suggestions welcome.

-Jay

Hello all,

Have any of you had experience with the Wordpress Manual Plugin (http://www.videousermanuals.com/)? If so, worth the price?

Thanks,
