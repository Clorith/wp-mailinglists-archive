Hey Everyone, 

We are growing quick here at UNC and are looking to put some larger sites on our wordpress installation.  With this comes the need to specify more rights on the site and create groups that have rights to certain folders, etc.  We are looking at permissions plugins and have three in mind.  

- Permit Press (http://presspermit.com/press-permit-overview/) - made by the same guy that made Role Scoper
- Role Scoper (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/role-scoper/)
- User Access Manager (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-access-manager/)

I was interested to hear what others are using to control rights to certain pages, and custom user groups.  Has anyone had experience with these three?  Are there others out there we should look at in our evaluation?  Any other tips, suggestions, etc?

Thanks,

We had some bad results with Role Scoper.  It's been a while, so might be better now, but when we were using it back in March of 2011 we found that it was not ideal for a large multi-site install.  The roles were applied across the whole system, not just for an individual site, and when assigning roles it had to access the whole user list, so very very slow.

We have had better luck with capability manager and have been using it pretty extensively.

Haven't tried the other two!

Thank you all.  These are great suggestions we have added to our evaluation.

Best,
