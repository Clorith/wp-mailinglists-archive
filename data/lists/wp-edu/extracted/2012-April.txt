Hi,

I'm looking for recommendations for a rock-solid plain vanilla wordpress theme. I want something that has all the latest WP tricks, great mark-up and expandability. I also need to be able to skin it 100% to my liking.

A google search is fruitful, but I'm hoping for some real life, "I've used this one..." feedback.

Thanks,
~bob

Hi Bob,

That is kinda one of those 'how long is a piece of string' questions! Sorta depends on you needs.

If you want 'rock solid plain vanilla' It's hard to go past the default twentyten and twentyeleven themes.

I have used twentyten for a local community group at http://kiamabug.org.au that is used successfully by complete novices for updating new articles, photos, etc.

Blogolife is another that I have used for another group here in Kiama - http://kiamatennis.org.au - which is pretty plain, has plenty of options, but does the job for those who want to add content without needing too much expertise in maintaining a site.

Another theme that might be worth a look is Suffusion. Again, a zillion options. Example at http://www.sthgrafton-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/

Hope this helps (I am sure that you will receive a stack of suggestions - everyone has a favorite!)

Warren

Hi Bob,

My go-to theme for creating quick, effective and good looking child themes
is Thematic, a free WordPress framework that's perfect for rapid
modification. You can find it here -  http://themeshaper.com/thematic/.
I've used it for http://masonvotes.gmu.edu/ and http://nightmaremode.net/ and
others. There's a great guide to using it to make themes, available at
http://www.sitepoint.com/books/wordpress1/.


I've not yet used it (though I plan to for my next project) but the
WordPress-sphere is pretty abuzz about Reverie -
http://themefortress.com/reverie/ - a WordPress theme framework build on
ZURB's Foundation, which is a framework for rapid HTML5 responsive web
prototyping. It uses HTML5 Boilerplate, hNews microformat, and is fully
responsive, allowing you to create a theme that looks good on all devices.
If you do use it, shoot me an email to say how it goes.
