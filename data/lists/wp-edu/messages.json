Is this list intended to be a space for\nwarehousing that information and the re-packaging it to push WordPress\nas a product rather than a process for thinking through the\nimplications of the new state of publishing for education?\nI mean wordpres is great and all, and many have used it to some great\nadvantage, but it seems like you are suggesting we participate in the\ncreation of an Automattic brochure devoid of the personal relations\nthat foster the community that has made WordPress what it is. All of\nwhich kind of seems strange to me. The conversation is in progress,\nwhy not follow and join it where it is happening if you are th\neducation evangelist for WordPress. That seem more relevant that\ncreating a pdf for a mass mailer?\nI don't know, just seems that once we formalize the discussion around\nWordPress as product too much, the joy of thinking through\npossibilities kind of evaporates.\nBest,\nJim\nOn Tue, Nov 18, 2008 at 10:15 PM, Douglas Hanna \u003cdoug@automattic.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e Hi everyone,\n\u003e\n\u003e Thanks for coming up with such great discussions and contributing so\n\u003e much to this list.

    "body": "Hi,\nI'm a student who wrote the BuddyPress Courseware tool during last year\nGSoC. I remember I asked about feedback last year before applying for\nit, and with this email I would like to bring some reports about how the\nproject evolved and maybe get some feedback from this list teachers\nabout next directions for such a project.\nWarning, long email!!!\nDuring last year Courseware got:\n* official ScholarPress family adoption [2]\n* 6 more releases from initial 0.1 version (last one in March)\n* 22 issues closed (5 feature requests/6 reports were invalid) [3]\n* 18 open issues (2 marked as defect, the rest are feature requests)\n* \u003e4k downloads \n* 12 reviews[4] (only two gave less than 5 stars)\n* 62 forums topics with 115 members [5] (most of the support is done\nthere)\n* 15 github watchers and 5 forks\n* WordCamp Bucharest superstar!\nSome people showcased their websites here:\nhttp://buddypress.org/community/groups/buddypress-courseware/forum/topic/scholarpress-samples/\nIt's features cover:\n* Class Dashboard\n* Courses\n  * Works for both learning models: European/United States\n* Bibliography\n  * Web API's integration with WorldCat/ISBNdb\n  * BibTex Import\n* Assignments\n  * Responses\n  * Forum integration\n  * Gradebook\n    * CSV Import\n* Schedules\n  * Calendar\n    * Month, Week, Day view\n    * Integrates with Assignment due dates\n    * iCal export\n* Customization using an external CSS\nAfaik, until now, this is the only LMS build on a social network\nplatform.\nThis year idea:\nBuddyPress Courseware lacks a good set of features without which it\ncan't be called a complete alternative to some commercial apps or the\nsame Moodle. Some of them are:\n* A well written and easy to use Quizes/Tests module (integrated with\nexisting Gradebook)\n* Advanced reports with charts and progress details (per student/per\nclass)\n* Native support for external authentication mechanism like LDAP/AD\n(with automatic roles mapping)\n* Attendance functionality\n* Class pages (not just Courseware description)\n* Make it even more modular (offer a screen to enable/disable components\nfor every class)\n* Class cloning (create a new class based on an existing one by\nselecting it's content teacher wants)\n* Integration with other LMS like Moodle (users import/export or\nauthentication at least)\n* Improved UI for Bibliography (tagging entries and using tags instead\nof manually adding the items)\n* Add a \"Vimeo like save for later\" functionality to generate \"ToDo\"\nlists/plans for students or allow teachers create \"recommended stuff\"\nlists for their students.\nTherefore I propose to implement the above listed features this summer.\nAlso, following the last year feedback, a lot of teachers don't like the\nBuddyPress because it requires additional resources and knowledge from\ntheir side (maintaining and helping students easily adapt to it), and\nexpressed a wish to see Courseware, a standalone WordPress plugin that\ncan be used in a MultiSite environment with every teacher being able to\nsetup his own classes.\nUnfortunately ScholarPress Courseware codebase is a bit old and requires\nwork to get it up-to-date with the latest WordPress features (post\ntypes, post format... etc) and version compatibility. It lacks already\navailable features in BuddyPress version (very important, like multiple\nclasses, gradebook and responses). That's why to reduce the amount of\nwork on making two projects work, I would like to merge both projects\ninto one codebase (mostly BuddyPress Courseware will cover it's previous\nWordPress version).\nSo to complete my idea I want to merge the WordPress and BuddyPress\nversion making them able to work with or without BuddyPress. Basically\nthis means I will write a \"minimal BuddyPress\" layer (the permalink\nhandler part, a minimal groups component that will use post\ntypes/taxonomies, add a minimal profile page) that will activate if\nBuddyPress is missing. Current BuddyPress Courseware is very modular so\nthe features available only in BuddyPress will use a fallback\nmechanism/solution (notification or another alternative I will offer).\nBy the end of this summer, if the project gets accepted, WordPress will\nprobably can be listed as one of the serious LMS tools provider too.\nI would like to get some feedback on all this stuff, or maybe I'm\nmissing some important features and teachers can say something about\nthat.\nThanks in advance.\n[1]: http://buddypress.org/community/groups/buddypress-courseware/home/\n[2]: https://github.com/scholarpress\n[3]: https://github.com/scholarpress/buddypress-courseware/issues/closed\n[4]:\nhttp://buddypress.org/community/groups/buddypress-courseware/reviews/\n[5]: http://buddypress.org/community/groups/buddypress-courseware/forum/\n[6]: http://scholarpress.github.com/buddypress-courseware/",

    "body": "Hi David - i've recently been working on a Multisite Network and found\na neat way to control user levels with a mix of using PODS to extend\nuser tables, custom child theme template files as well as actions and\nfilter hooks thus share the following ideas in case this might help\nyou ..??.. info below and best of success ... cordially, chuck scott\na) extend your user meta tables with PODS ... the PODS plugin made it\na piece of cake for me to extend the user table with custom variables\nand then have those fields as part of their user profile ... in\naddition i could set these new user fields so that they could be\nedited / changed by one role (e.g., editor, teacher or other custom\nrole defined) as well as make them not editable (or not viewable) to\nthe user ...\nonce you have some name-value pairs that make sense for your team,\nnext i would go about creating custom page templates in child theme\nthat then check the usermeta table for permission to access that page\n...\nb) okay this might not be ideal for a large class, but you might think\nof creating custom page templates for each student and then put some\ncode in those pages to check to see if the person accessing that page\nis that student or a teacher and if so, edit away ... thus if you\ncreate a custom page template called student.php then for a class of\nthirty people, you would have 30 copies of that file, each modified to\nthe student name or id - e.g., student-charlie.php, student-fred.php,\nstudent-mary.php, student-snoopy.php etc ... then in each page you\ncould use the get_user_meta to go grab the meta value you created via\nPODS to see if there is a match to that student and go from there ...\nc) an example ... i'm working on a membership site with several sub\nsites on the network ... essentially two kinds of network members,\nread only, and read-write ... initially i created new roles for the\nread-write level and assigned the read-only to subscriber but even\nsubscriber has ability to add comments so i needed to block that ...\nyet i also realized that managing the read-write users by adding them\nto multiple sub sites was a bit of pain ... my solution was to use\nPODS (note i tried Advance Custom Fields and other plugins and code\nbut personally found PODS to be easiest, fastest, most intuitive), to\nextend the user table by creating some new fields, one of which is\ncalled \"membershiptype\" ... with this new user field, i could then add\ncode to custom pages (e.g., like comments.php) to look at the\nmembershiptype before showing the comment_form(); ... i could also add\nfilters like the one below to look at the membershiptype during login\nto run checks before moving to another level ...\nd) with respect to your students accessing their own posts ... i'd\nprobably use a plugin like Justin Tadlock's Members Plugin to create\nthe new roles and capabilities you need ... thus with a mix of new\nroles, some new user meta values, and some custom page templates\nand/or actions/filters - voila -\u003e path to success :\u003e)\n-------\nExample of filter i put in my custom functionality plugin - this\nfilter looks at the custom field i created with PODS called\n\"membershptype\" and looks for a value of \"Disabled\" and if it finds\nthat to true, prevents the user from logging in ...\n/* CS - Check if membership type is flagged */\nadd_filter( 'wp_authenticate_user', 'cs_auth_login', 10, 1);\nfunction cs_auth_login ( $user ) {\n    if ( get_user_meta ( $user-\u003eID, 'membershiptype', true ) == 'Disabled' ) {\n        return new WP_Error ( 'test', __(\"Sorry - Account Disabled ...\") );\n    }\n    return $user;\n}\n- fin -\n\u003e I'm setting up a WP site for a class.

We are also using the following add-ons:\nGF Custom Post Types (maps form content to CPT custom fields)\nGF Update Post\nGF WYSIWYG (adds WYSIWYG to text area)\nUsing the Custom Fields block and the Post blocks, we have been able to automate user input into specific content fields, both CPT and standard post fields (title, excerpt, content, etc.), including file upload. There are hidden fields that automate which Category a post will go into upon submission, post order (custom field plus a modified loop), and some other functions.php hacks to draw content from one field and copy it into another post field with alternate formatting (such first name/last name field into Title).\nThis, in combination with the Adminimize plugin has allowed us to create a stripped down, super easy student e-portfolio system for students without the need for WordPress training.

    "body": "Hi,\nJust found this list and I hope that what I want to do fits the purpose of\nthe list somewhat. From looking through the archives, I'm hoping I'm not off\ntarget.\nI presently have an online sewing school using Moodle and although the\nsoftware is great it doesn't lend itself as well to a commercial\nenvironment. in addition, my instructors are not always real computer savvy\nso it makes it difficult for them to wade thru the complexity of it.  Plus\nso much of it is overkill for my use.  (Don't need grading e, LMS etc.) I\nneeded a frontend (for the commercial aspect) which i tried Joomla but the\nintegraton was just too cumbersome.\nSo I've decide to use WorPress because it's easier to use for all. It will\nbe a pay per course or group of courses with a variety of instructors.  Lots\nof videos, forums for each course, photo galleries etc. And of course there\nwill be a fabric store, book stores etc., at the front end. And so I have\nlots to do with getting ready for the move of the school.\nI'm looking at membershp plugins, PayPal plugins, course plugs and many\nother plugins. I'm testing many of them now.\nIs anyone out there trying or have a online school that charges per course\nand has a curriculum? Or something similar?\n-- \nSandy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20090228/7e9cd99d/attachment.htm",

Joomla! As a CMS is best suited for e-commerce sort of things. But if you?re going to have a LOT of content, it might be a good route to go. Drupal is different in that it?s more focused on community - user profiles, forums, discussion.\nI personally think that WP does a much better job at connect people and letting them easily comment. Designing for WordPress really isn?t very hard and the platform is so extensible and quick that if you?re looking at say, 15 pages or so, it will work great. I use WP for a music festival our college holds each year and it?s definitely not a blog: http://www.agapefest.com but that will give you some idea of how you can use child/parent Pages as well as dynamic content in the form of news.\nHope that helps, and if you have any specific questions, I?d be glad to help you out.\nJoel\nJoel Goodman\nWeb Content Coordinator\nGreenville College\n315 E College Ave.\nGreenville, IL 62246\nTEL/618.664.6515\nWEB/www.greenville.edu\u003chttp://www.greenville.edu/\u003e\nEMAIL/joel.goodman@greenville.edu\u003cmailto:joel.goodman@greenville.edu\u003e\nFuturistic ?

        "body": "You will hear different stories from a variety of places. Developers  \nin education are no different than developers in other areas and will  \nbe evangelical about solutions.\nI cannot fault them, any solution in large organizations requires  \nwork. Decisions can be based on knowledge, budget, enterprise  \nrequirements, data portability, and a host of other factors. Of course  \ncooperation, trust, and the final outcome are probably the biggest  \nareas that my administrators looked at.\nIn my case I run a website (http://www.nicholls.edu) where roughly 80%  \nis built with single installations of WordPress. I ran though several  \nCMS solutions, but was forced to make a quick decision on my own. I am  \nthe only staff member doing web-work, so I had the leverage to choose  \na tool that I could deal with quickly and efficiently. At the time  \nWPMU was not an option, but it is sure on my wish list now. It started  \nas a choice, so departments could chose between static HTML and  \nWordPress. I did leave the door open for other choices (drupal,  \njoomla), but no one has desired anything else.\nMy focus was on end users, so the solution needed to be easy to use,  \neasy to train, and easy to troubleshoot. My primary users are  \nadministrative secretaries, so the skill level is mostly based on  \ndesktop word-processing applications. After training an entire  \ndivision of roughly 30 administrators to use Dreamweaver, WordPress  \nbecame a welcome replacement.\nI did one meeting with our Web Committee and showed WordPress 2.0 in  \naction. I showed a couple of other solutions both OSS and Commercial.  \nThe questions I encountered were:\n1. Cost?\n2. Development? How hard is it to replace you or this WordPress thing?\n3. Time frame for conversion of existing sites?\n4. Extendability?\n5. How can this fit into other stuff like on-line learning and  \nstudent / employee services systems.\nNo. 5 was left to a wait and see since we going through a massive  \nupgrade to those systems, but our IT department likes to keep some  \nseparation between public and private systems anyway.\nThe easy answer:\nIt depends on your organization and those involved in the decision.\nJess\n[    :P    ]    jess planck    -    http://funroe.net\nOn Jan 30, 2009, at 6:58 AM, Abhishek wrote:\n\u003e My business schools (Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta) is  \n\u003e one of the top ranked B schools in India and hence the site needs to  \n\u003e be spot on, on the first try.

Oct. 15th will be a Hack Day with both\nopportunities for developers and non-developers to participate.  The\nnon-developer track will focus on BuddyPress documentation or a beginners\nguide to BuddyPress.\nFor more info:\nhttp://2012.vancouver.buddypress.org/\nWe also still have a few slots available for speakers so if you are\npassionate about BuddyPress and would like to participate as a speaker, we\nwould love to hear from you.  Please see our Call for Speakers page.\nhttp://2012.vancouver.buddypress.org/call-for-speakers/\nFinally, if your school has benefited from BuddyPress, maybe you could\nconsider being a sponsor for this not-for-profit, WordPress Foundation\nsupported event:\nhttp://2012.vancouver.buddypress.org/sponsors/\nNote: There will also be WordCamp Vancouver taking place on Oct. 13th, the\nday before BuddyCamp. It will include a user and developer track.\nhttp://2012.vancouver.wordcamp.org/  You could have three days of\nWordPress/BuddyPress awesomeness!\nFinally, many of you may know already this year's Open Education Conference\nwill be taking place in Vancouver from Oct. 16th to 18th so another great\nevent you may want to check out and perhaps combine with WordCamp and\nBuddyCamp:\nhttp://openedconference.org/2012/\nThanks,\nCyri\nFaculty,\nSchool of Business\nBCIT\n604-783-8601\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20120915/8a264c69/attachment.htm\u003e",

    "body": "Hello all.  This list could not have come at a better time.  I was recently\nawarded a project for a local elementary school district.  There are five\nschools in all.  The initial focus of the revised site will be a new website\nfor the district and the board of education, then a new site for each\nschool.  After that initial work is done, we'll be creating individual\nclassroom sites, something like 100 classroom sites/pages.  The teachers\ncurrently use Apple iWeb to create their sites and upload them with FTP.\nThere is a link on the individual school page to their personalized space.\nI am not sure if we'll be retaining that, or converting them all over to\nWordPress.  If we convert to WordPress, we'd need a way to allow them some\nfreedom with the design, as they have now with iWeb.\nI'm looking forward to learning more from other's experiences, especially\nwith WPMU.  I've done 30 or 40 websites so far with WordPress, but none with\nMU, and I'm not sure if it makes sense to start with MU here, planning for\nthe inevitibility of all the classroom sites going to WordPress.  I maintain\nmy WordPress installations with subversion now, and it's not too bad, but\ndoing the same thing with 100+ sites might be a bit of a challenge.  One\ncode base definitely sounds better to me.\nThanks,\nChris Hajer\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20081106/6a8d0dcf/attachment-0001.htm",

        "body": "Hi Dave,\nAs far as I've seen, that limit on uploaded file types is specific to multisite, not configurable in standard, because the possible security problem of untrusted (or less-trusted) users doesn't exist in single-user WordPress.  If you're the single user, it can be assumed that you trust yourself.\nIn multisite, though, that option does work fine.  WordPress does utilize it, without any plugins, or at least it always has in our install.  We can add new file types to that list, and files of that type can then be uploaded.  Or conversely, when we remove file types from that list, they can no longer be uploaded.\nSo if that's not working for you, there must be something else wrong.  Maybe php settings?  \nIf everything's functioning as it should, as it's designed to, that list of acceptable file types is workable and effective.\nJoe\n-- \nJoseph Ugoretz, PhD\nAssociate Dean of Teaching, Learning and Technology\nMacaulay Honors College - CUNY\n35 West 67th St.\nNew York, NY 10023\n212.729.2920\nhttp://macaulay.cuny.edu\nOn May 10, 2012, at 11:21 AM, Whisler, Dave wrote:\n\u003e I need to know the best way to add/remove items from the list of acceptable file types (file extensions) that are permitted in WordPress 3.x.x.\n\u003e  \n\u003e Standard WordPress (non-multisite):  It does not have any options to add/remove file from the WP Dashboard.\n\u003e WP MultiSite Installation:  If you go into the network admin Dashboard, it has a field that has a list of acceptable file types here:   Dashboard -\u003e Settings -\u003e Network Settings -\u003e  ?Upload file types?.

If you want to check out the open accessibility issues that remain to be fixed in core, their issue tracker might be helpful: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/focus/accessibility (in my experience, the editor-facing dashboard mostly has trouble with regards to color contrast and in places where JavaScript is used heavily, like the Customizer, or where complex WAI-ARIA interactions can get muddled)\nThe accessibility non-profit Knowbility has run workshops and conference talks on WordPress and accessibility (including ones focused on the admin dashboard), so they might be a good resource to contact as far as compliance testing is concerned: http://www.knowbility.org/\nAnd the WP core team?s Slack has an #accessibility channel, so you could also always ask them for more info directly! https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\nBest,\nAdam\n--\nAdam Norwood\nSenior Web Strategist / Developer\nThe University of Texas School of Law\n(512) 471-3040    Twitter: @anorwood\nReply-To: \"wp-edu at lists.automattic.com\" \u003cwp-edu at lists.automattic.com\u003e\nTo: \"wp-edu at lists.automattic.com\" \u003cwp-edu at lists.automattic.com\u003e\nI'm seeking insights or first-hand experiences from colleagues who can speak to the degree of accessibility compliance with Wordpress core from an administrator's or content editor's perspective.

The table creation and formatting\nfunctionality that it provides is quite solid and complete.  \nAll the best.\nLoren\n \n[mailto:wp-edu-bounces at lists.automattic.com] On Behalf Of Whisler, Dave\nSent: October 8, 2010 11:42 AM\nTo: wp-edu at lists.automattic.com\n \nLoren,\n \nThanks for the suggestion to try WP-Table-Reloaded, but I had seen that one\npreviously and opted not to try it.   \nI saw that this plugin is pretty popular and so thought it  might work for\nme.   However.. not didn't seem to be optimal for what I had in mind (though\nI could be wrong).\n \nHere's my reasoning:   It seems to suggest that it stores each \"table\" that\nyou create ( I guess for re-use purposes) and then you reference that table\nin your post/page using a special shortcode.   \nAm I correct in this?    If so, that might work for some situations, but I'm\nthinking that most times you'd want the actual content in the table to be\nstored in the actual post/page and not simply hitting a reference to where\nit's stored somewhere else.   What if someone removes the actual table data\nin the \"plugin\" backend - or deinstalled the plugin (or it stops working due\nto a upgrade or the plugin dev. Stops.)\n \nWhat I'm pursuing is simply a way to generate the html needed for formatting\nin the front-end editor - thus, even if the editor plugin I use to do this\nfunction \"goes away\", breaks, or I deinstall it, the content in the\npage/post is not dependent on it - since it's just standard HTML.     \n \nThanks,\n \nDave\n \n \nDavid K.

    "body": "misspelling pages\nWe are experiencing an issue that impacts any superadmin who manually types in the web address to access a blog dashboard who also makes a typo when manually typing in the URL. \nFor example, if a superadmin (who has previously authenticated into blogname.edu) types in this address for a blog dashboard: \nhttp://blogname.edu/whaaaaaaaat/wp-admin/ \nthen they are typing in a non-existent dashboard URL (the correct URL should be http://blogname.edu/what/wp-admin/). \nI thought that by typing in a URL to a non-existent site would load a file not found or 404 error page. However, no error page loads for superadmins in this case. Instead, the root (blogname.edu/wp-admin/) page loads and the URL with the typo remains listed in the web address bar, giving false information to the blog user. This resulted in our blog's homepage being accidentally edited.\nIs this a default behavior in WordPress MultiSite, or is this due to some misconfiguration on our part?\nCan anyone verify that this happens on their MultiSite install as well?\nAnyone have any ideas how I could fix it?\nAny help would be very much appreciated!\nCheers,\nBrian Sears\nSenior Enterprise Systems Administrator\nHenrico County Public Schools",

Kelly O?Donnell and Dr. Lisa Brundage, for almost a year now.  The project is called Science Forward and the site is at:\nhttp://cuny.is/scienceforward\nThe site is designed to present a new approach to teaching science (in particular to undergraduate non-majors).  We?re working on building out the resources, and would love to have comments and responses.\nChief among those resources right now is a series of six videos (we?re hoping to produce more in the months to come, if these are well-received).  The videos, like everything on the site, are licensed with a CC BY-SA-NC license.  And we definitely hope they will be useful!\nThis first series is six videos on six different topics:\n1. What is Science?\n2. Urban Ecology\n3. Evolution\n4. Climate Change\n5. Artificial Intelligence\n6. The Challenge of Food\nIn all these topics, we're using a basic framework that we call the \"Science Senses\": Number Sense, Data Sense and Knowledge Sense (of course there's a video about those, too!)\nThe direct link to the videos page is http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/scienceforward/videos\nThe videos are meant to be used in support of science classes (or any class where science is a topic of discussion).  They?re designed to be engaging and stimulating?to prompt discussion and more questions.  They?re not meant to communicate large amounts of content or to provide ?coverage? of any given topic.\nPlease share widely!\nJoe\n--\nJoseph Ugoretz, PhD\nAssociate Dean\nTeaching, Learning and Technology\nMacaulay Honors College, CUNY\n35 West 67th St.\nNew York, New York 10023\n212-729-2920\u003ctel://212-729-2920\u003e\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20140820/d20ac2eb/attachment.html\u003e",

One of the biggest requests is the  \nability for the instructors to easily access artifacts (the CPT) based  \non a goals category (the custom taxonomy).\n From my searches this morning it looks as if there's not a plugin or  \nreal easy way to query across the entire site based on a specific CPT  \nand taxonomy.  The much-used sitewide tags plugin seems to be the  \nclosest, but as we're not using \"normal\" posts and tags this won't do.\nHave you investigated anything like this at your institution?

We all want to let her know that every last one of her acts of love, has been remembered.???\n?\n?? What if you were to write to her telling her about all of those things that mean so much to you. All of those memories. What if those events were recorded for future generations to treasure. All of those special days and the times you shared together, blended with pictures and images that you know are special to her. And to you as well.\n?\nImagine the look on Mums face on Christmas morning as she unwraps her present. Think about how thrilled she will be to discover the book you wrote.? Just for her. All about her.\n?\nNow imagine how good you will feel as well. Knowing you've achieved what most other people often talk about but never get round to.\n?\nAnd it's a little bit like achieving immortality because once your book is published it exists forever.\n?\nNow you may be thinking you can't write and publish a book between now and Xmas.

Join #1 International Best selling author and book writing authority, Mike Noone as he leads you step by step, through the proven recipe for writing the perfect gift that will last forever in your Mum's heart.It's simpler than cooking a Christmas pudding.\nThis year, don't just give her a present. Give her a timeless heirloom.\n?? Book early because this hands on workshop will fill up fast. I am strictly limiting the number of places to just 20, so that you get the attention you need to learn how to do this, easily.\nWe chose St Andrews on the Terrace as our venue because it is at the heart of Wellington with easy access by buses, trains and road. We priced the workshop so that you can save a fortune over the years using our secret recipe.\nHow many landmark events happen every year in your life and in the lives of everyone you know ?

    "body": "Thanks, Skip, for the link to your course.  I had heard of your work but somehow had never actually seen your course sites, and they really provide an excellent set of models.  The idea of partly open and partly closed is an important one for me (and for my students). And using the variety of resources and evolving as the options change is just as important. I also would like a truly elegant discussion board grading solution...none of the lms solutions really have that.\nAs far as the gradebook itself, Christopher, I think we might be running into a disconnect between scoring and grading. Comments and extended feedback are really the heart of what grading can be if it is a tool for development and improvement beyond assessment. KB gradebook, because it is just taking anything the instructor enters, gives the opportunity for those comments and detailed responses right there on the grades page for the students, not just letter grades or numeric scores.  From the instructor's point of view, this is much less than work than composing a separate email or message to each student, because the feedback is all there in one place and saved so on assignment number three i can look back and see (it is in the same row on the spreadsheet) exactly what i said to the student about assignment number one. It is also more secure than email (important, because grades are federally-protected student information for public institutions), and easier to back up in multiple locations.",

At my University we have WPMU running a few dozen blogs with various levels of activity but typically it's teams such as mine - Web Services who manage our websites - blogging about the work they're doing, what they're looking at and basically using it to improve communication with other interested people.\nI can understand that using blogs for teaching and learning would add extra requirements for ensuring that student work was properly archived but merely having a few blogs isn't that dangerous.\nOr maybe I'm crazy brave?!\nMike\n\u003e\u003e\u003e \"John BLAHUSIAK\" \u003cj.blahusiak@ecu.edu.au\u003e 11/08/08 9:25 AM \u003e\u003e\u003e\nI am surprised to hear that Wordpress would be implemented in Universities.  In the UK and Australia and I suspect other jurisdictions the record keeping requirements on Universities are onerous -- primarily as a result of direct and indirect legislative requirements (for instance, Records FOI, Privacy acts etc).\nI can how Wordpress and associated tools would be of use in relation to facilitating conversations across Universites.  But as far as I can gather there is not a record keeping module for Wordpress -- to allow easy porting into common electronic document management software.\nEssentially every time a user hit publish or comment they would be either creating a new record or a new version of an existing record.

        "body": "We use wpmu and buddypress heavily for our student (BuddyPress just having started for this year).  Because we have students on seven different campuses, they had been asking for a long time for a good way to communicate with students who might have similar interests on other campuses--and BuddyPress provides them exactly that.  I think it has huge value in a campus-wide install--with a couple of caveats.  In some cases, students feel like it's replicating what they can already get from facebook--so why bother.  Slowly they are discovering that having more control over the system and the content is a good thing--and having automatic population and connection to their classmates is also good.\nOur main WPMU install is for eportfolios--which we define extremely broadly--there are course websites, group websites, travel blogs, reflective eportfolios, professional eportfolios, personal blogs, group blogs, teaching eportfolios, etc. etc.\nUnfortunately I don't have plugins for the purposes you describe--but here's what we are using as of today:\nAda Active Blogs--\nAda New Blogs\n Ada Updated Blogs\nNone of these are really useful if you have BuddyPress, but they're still lingering in the install.\n Add Users Sidebar Widget.\nVery useful for class blogs\n Admin Footer Text\nbbPress Integration\nProvides single sign on login with a bbPress installation.\n BM Custom Login\nDisplay custom images on the wordpress login screen. Useful for branding.\nBuddyPress\nBuddyPress will add social networking features to a new or existing WordPress MU installation.\n Calendar\nNice and simple Calendar with events support and full customization:)\nCategory Order\nThe Category Order plugin allows you to easily reorder your categories the way you want via drag and drop.\n Comment Sorter\nSorts and filters comments by date and name. Can disable trackbacks too.\nConversation Starter\nThis plugin prompts readers to answer a question in your comments.\n Custom CUNY Academic Commons Profile Filters\nChanges the way that profile data fields get filtered into clickable URLs. in BuddyPress profiles\nCustomize Meta Widget\nAdd or remove links from meta widget, especially sometimes annoying link to wordpress.org\u003chttp://wordpress.org\u003e.\ndigress.it\u003chttp://digress.it\u003e\ndigress.it\u003chttp://digress.it\u003e (the evolution of commentpress) allows readers to comment paragraph by paragraph in the margins of a text. You can use it to comment, gloss, workshop, debate and more!  Excellent resource for class blogs/sites--but a little fussy to use.  We don't let students activate this one themselves.\n Easy LaTeX\nEasiest way to show mathematical equations on your blog. Important for Math/science students\nEvents Registration\nFantastic resource for event signups. (not for all blogs)\nFeedWordPress\nsimple and flexible Atom/RSS syndication for WordPress Great for aggregation\nFlickr Photo Album\nThis plugin will retrieve your Flickr photos and allow you to easily add your photos to your posts. Next-Gen Gallery is more useful\n Google Maps Quicktag - MU\nGoogle Maps Quicktag makes it convenient to open the Google Maps web site while editing, where you can generate your map and copy the needed code to paste into the editor. Due to a security concern, WordPress MU sites with open registration are not recommended. Use at your own risk.\nGroup Forum Subscripton for BuddyPress\nGives users the ability to subscribe to email notifications of discussion activity in their BuddyPress groups.  If you use BuddyPress groups, you need this.\n Inline Posts\nAllows you to include posts in pages (and in other posts). To include a post, just enter its ID in square brackets in the body of a page or another post (e.g., [[42]]). Very handy.\nList-All\nCreates a list of all blogs on a WPMU site--not needed if you have BuddyPress\nNextGEN Gallery\nA NextGENeration Photo gallery for the Web 2.0.--Excellent, but a little hard for students to learn to use.\nPage Link Manager\nAdds admin panel to choose which pages appear in the site navigation.\n pageMash\nManage your multitude of pages with pageMash's slick drag-and-drop style, ajax interface. Allows quick sorting, hiding and organising of parenting.\nPeter's Collaboration E-mails\nEnhance the \"Submit for Review\" feature for Contributor users. This plugin enables automatic e-mails to the relevant users when posts are pending, when they are approved, and when their statuses are changed from \"pending\" back to \"draft\".\npodPress\nThe podPress pluggin gives you everything you need in one easy plugin to use WordPress for Podcasting.  Under-rated for what it does.  Most people like Anarchy better.  I do not.\nPrivacy Options\nAdds more privacy options to the options-privacy and wpmu-blogs pages. Just drop in mu-plugins, no core edits needed.\nRecent Commenters Widget.\nThis is a very very simple modification of the default recent comments widget. All this does is to display recent commentERS instead of recent comments. In other words, it just displays the names, without the \"...on name-of-the-post\" that is there by default. You can choose whether or not you want the name to have a link, and what it will link to, if it's there (I wrote this one myself!)\n Role Manager\nRole Management for WordPress 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x and 2.5.x.. Excellent for course blogs\nScholarPress Courseware\nAll-in-one course management for WordPress. Potentially useful.  Haven't found it to be really there yet--and not yet quite compatible with WPMU\nSidebar Login\nAdds a sidebar widget to let users login\nSimple:Press Forum\nFully featured but simple page-based forum\nSpectacu.la Threaded comments\nMake it easy to add threaded comments to any theme. (brand new)\nSubscribe To Comments\nAllows readers to receive notifications of new comments that are posted to an entry. Very useful\n Unfiltered MU\nAdds the unfiltered_html capablitiy to Administrators and Editors so that content posted by users with those roles is not filtered by KSES; Embeds, Iframe, etc. are preserved. Note: If for any reason the unfiltered_html capability is ever lost, simply deactivate, and then reactivate this plugin.  Security risk, so be sure you know what you're doing--but critical if you want people to embed.\nWordPress Wiki\nAdd Wiki functionality to your wordpress site.  Promising but doesn't do what I wanted it to do.\n WP-SpamFree\nAn extremely powerful anti-spam plugin that virtually eliminates comment spam. Finally, you can enjoy a spam-free WordPress blog! Includes spam-free contact form feature as well.\nWP Ajax Edit Comments\nThe most powerful comment-editing solution for WordPress. Users can edit their own comments for a limited time, while admins can edit all comments.\nWPhone\nA lightweight admin interface for the iPhone and other mobile devices.\nWPMU Enable bbPress Capabilities\n WPMU Mailer\nMass emailer for WPMU (only for administrator, and only for the whole site--not customizable enough yet)\n WP Sentry\nGranular user and group access controls for private posts.\n--\nJoseph Ugoretz, PhD\nDirector of Technology and Learning\nWilliam E.

    "body": "I'm not sure if this is specific in some way to our install, but I thought I'd share because it caused me so much pain before we fixed the problem.\nWe've been using the plugin \"Email Users\" on many of our class sites in our fairly large network for a couple of years.  It's always worked very well, even though it's officially not tested on a multisite install.\nThen sometime a couple of weeks ago, probably about the time we passed the 2000-user mark as the new semester began, we started having mysql failures several times a day.  Intermittently, at odd times, mysql CPU usage would jump way up--as far as 205%, so it would stop responding until restarted from the command line.  \nI tried a lot of different troubleshooting steps, looked at the mysql slow queries log, and found that most of those times the cause was a query to the wp-usermeta table. But other times queries to that same table were going through quickly with no problem. But I could not figure out (my skills are not strong enough) anything beyond that. \nFinally on Wednesday we had someone notice that every time she tried to email all students in her class using the Email Users plugin, that triggered the problem (we only noticed because she tried the email, mysql hung, I restarted mysql, she tried again, and it hung again.)\nI deleted that plugin, nobody is using it anymore, and the problem is completely solved.  No more issues and the site is fast and responsive and stable again.\nSo if you're using this plugin, beware.  It seems to have problems with large installs. \n-- \nJoseph Ugoretz, PhD\nAssociate Dean of Teaching, Learning and Technology\nMacaulay Honors College - CUNY\n35 West 67th St.\nNew York, NY 10023\n212.729.2920\nhttp://macaulay.cuny.edu",

Then she gives the password for that page\n\u003eto the class, so the students can all get the files.\n\u003e\n\u003eSo far, so good, but the problem is that even though the page is\n\u003epassword-protected, the uploaded files are not.  So anyone who has the\n\u003edirect link can download those files without knowing the password. And\n\u003egoogle does index the content of pdf files, so it's very possible, in\n\u003efact likely, that someone googling (for example) the author's name or\n\u003esome terms in the document will come across that direct link.\n\u003e\n\u003eI've tried as many of the .htaccess tricks for preventing this as I can\n\u003efind.  This looked like the best guide\n\u003ehttp://perishablepress.com/creating-the-ultimate-htaccess-anti-hotlinking-\n\u003estrategy/ but I tried many others.\n\u003e\n\u003eNone of them seem to work at all for multisite.  They don't stop the\n\u003eproblem in any way.\n\u003e\n\u003eIf you've got a tip or trick, I'd love to hear about it!  I'd be happy\n\u003ewith a solution that would work for the enitre network...or just for\n\u003especific sites.  I'm OK with just about anything that will work!\n\u003e\n\u003eThanks!\n\u003e\n\u003eJoe\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e-- \n\u003eJoseph Ugoretz, PhD\n\u003eAssociate Dean\n\u003eTeaching, Learning and Technology\n\u003eMacaulay Honors College\n\u003eThe City University of New York\n\u003e35 West 67th St.\n\u003eNew York, New York 10023\n\u003eTEL 212-729-2920\n\u003eFAX 212-580-8130\n\u003emacaulay.cuny.edu\n\u003e\n\u003e_______________________________________________\n\u003ewp-edu mailing list\n\u003ewp-edu at lists.automattic.com\n\u003ehttp://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-edu",

    "body": "Hey Alex,\nIt is like pulling teeth from a tyrannosaurus :-)\nI was sole developer/designer/administrator for Empire State College's\n\"Commons\" http://commons.esc.edu\nIt was a long road to get an instance set up, and once I did I had to\napprove all development decisions with non-technical director, which\nrestrained most of my ideas.  A little side note... this was developed and\nlaunched a year and half ago, and I've left my position since, because of\nthe experience.  ESC's Commons has Buddypress (really old version)\ninstalled, but most of it is disabled, and if I remember correctly I ended\nup hacking the core of Buddypress to get rid of some of the functionality,\nwhich was totally against my better judgement, but just wanted to get\nsomething a little more user-friendly for faculty to use and experiment with\n(deadlines).  I launched it and then left my position, and will soon be\nleaving the education sector all together.\nOur school has been using ANGEL for LMS for several years and has been\ninvestigating the next move to another LMS for over a year with a recent\nannouncement that the next contendor will be Moodle.  As far as CMS we had\nbeen running on Lotus Notes, which was a half-baked homegrown CMS solution.\n If you can call it that.  ESC is finally moving to a commercial solution\n(Terminal4), which is almost a year in on transition and there are 1 or 2\nlive micro-sites, but nothing official yet.\nESC's instance of WPMU (v 2.7 if I remember correctly) is running on an\ninternal server, which was hell setting up.  Authentication was a huge\nsticky point as our systems were antiquated (Lotus/LDAP/Active Directory).\n We ended up using LDAP plugin, but still wasn't working the way I would of\nliked to.  There have been no updates to the platform, and it is still\nrunning on the WPMU 2.7.\nMy advice would be to get ready to contribute code to WP community.  Perhaps\ntry to get a part-time or full-time developer to help get the system\nrunning.  Depending on how many customizations you'll need.  The CUNY\nCommons is a great example of what can be done.

Making the Case for WP in University Setting (Alexandre Enkerli)\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e ---------- Forwarded message ----------\n\u003e From: Alexandre Enkerli \u003cenkerli at gmail.com\u003e\n\u003e To: \"wp-edu at lists.automattic.com\" \u003cwp-edu at lists.automattic.com\u003e\n\u003e Date: Tue, 5 Jul 2011 22:08:01 -0400\n\u003e Subject: [wp-edu] Making the Case for WP in University Setting\n\u003e Hi,\n\u003e\n\u003e Been using WP in diverse contexts, including some of my activities as\n\u003e an instructor.\n\u003e After talking with diverse people needing advice about Web solutions\n\u003e for all sorts of things, I came to the realization that it'd be\n\u003e incredibly useful to have a university-supported install of WordPress\n\u003e (Multi-Site and hopefully BuddyPress-enabled).\n\u003e\n\u003e It's a big institution, so it can be difficult to request such things.\n\u003e Actually, the communications department is in the RFP phase of\n\u003e implementing a new (commercial) CMS, so energies are spent elsewhere.\n\u003e\n\u003e We use Moodle as the main course management system for most of the\n\u003e community, though the business school uses FirstClass for the same\n\u003e purposes. Many faculty members are dissatisfied with their course\n\u003e management system and, clearly, there's a need for something which\n\u003e goes beyond individual courses. This is a university with a strong\n\u003e involvement in the local community and there are many projects by\n\u003e students, staff, and faculty which could use an online space as a kind\n\u003e of ?university commons?.\n\u003e What's more, it'd be interesting to have some people do innovative\n\u003e work through WordPress. A dream I have is to use WP as a repository\n\u003e for ?learning objects?. Such projects can be done independently, but\n\u003e they're more interesting if they're hosted on university servers.\n\u003e Way back when, universities had ?personal homepages?, for all\n\u003e affiliated individuals. Why can't we have WP sites and BuddyPress\n\u003e profiles?\n\u003e\n\u003e Does anyone have advice on getting an academic institution to accept\n\u003e WP on their servers? I'll try to prepare a dossier, pointing to work\n\u003e done at diverse institutions (good thing Boone paved the way), and\n\u003e describing practical cases from faculty initiatives. It even sounds\n\u003e like the fear of having sensitive data held off-site could be a\n\u003e factor. But any insight as to how such a process went at other\n\u003e institutions would be very useful.\n\u003e\n\u003e Thank you.\n\u003e --\n\u003e Alex Enkerli\n\u003e http://Enkerli.com\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e wp-edu mailing list\n\u003e wp-edu at lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-edu\n\u003e\n\u003e\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20110706/0e727e64/attachment.htm\u003e",

We did this pretty much on trust, and we had no\nresources (or inclination) to enforce it. But it's been clear that the\ninformality of the arrangement hasn't stood the test of time: API keys\nhave been lent to non-academic projects, re-designs have abandoned the\nfooter and perhaps critically (for us) supporting the weight of spam\non .edu sites has become pretty expensive.\nAs we gave Akismet more resources, we also revisited the signup and\nsubscription processes. We tried to simplify and make clearer to those\nthat get real value from Akismet that they should actually pay for the\nservice. We had an Enterprise plan that was based around the number of\nsites, and an API plan that was based around the number of API calls\n(basically the number of comments submitted). Allowing users to pick\nbetween the two meant that almost all of our users could find a price\npoint at which they were able to use Akismet, while contributing to\nthe costs of running it. With one glaring exception...\nAcademic WordPress installs do tend to be unique because they spawn\nhuge numbers of individual sites, many of which are used for specific\nprojects and are then abandoned (attracting lots of spam). This means\nthat these installs tend to have (a) a lot of sites and (b) a lot of\nAPI calls.. making Akismet prohibitively expensive. But the\nmisconception has been that we don't care about this: it's really not\ntrue, we just struggled to figure out a good solution for a while.\nIn fact, the Enterprise (site-based) pricing didn't seem to work as\nwell as we'd hoped for some companies too. Thinking about the\nedu/multisite problem and also the issues that some companies were\nhaving, we decided to simplify the plan altogether and said that for\nthe Enterprise plan ($50/month) customers could now use Akismet on as\nmany sites as they liked, but with a limit of 80,000 comments per\nmonth.\nSo here's the exception: for .edu domains (only) using Akismet, we're\nwaiving the comment limit restriction. So you can use one API key for\na many sites as you like on your TLD, for $50/mo or $550/yr. So you\ncan have as many sites using Akismet as you like, so long as they're\nhosted on either a subdomain or directory of [yourdomain].edu. There's\none small caveat: we simply don't have the resources to manage\ninvoicing, checks and Accounts Payable departments for this kind of\nprice: so we ask that you/someone pays by credit card or electronic\ncheck. (You could also help my closing comments on unused sites.)\nSo -- that's the situation as it is now, and hopefully goes some way\nto setting the record straight. It saddens me when I hear that Akismet\nis unaffordable for academic institutions and they've had to move to\nTypekit Antispam (if the age of their homepage and that Arrington\nquote is anything to go by, it's not getting a lot of love these days)\nor, worse, Captchas. Hopefully $50 a month makes it considerably\neasier than it used to be. I know that it won't work for everybody,\nbut it might at least?allow more of you to use the service.\nHappy to answer any questions and hear your feedback.\nBest,\nPete.\n-- \n[ Pete Davies | Automattic Inc. |?http://about.me/petedavies?|\npete at automattic.com?| (415) 475-8007 ]",

Content which is deemed good\nenough quality that it contrubites towards revision/learning for a course\nwould be tagged by teachers with the course name/id. I envisioned having\neach of these items as a WordPress post in a special blog, which would have\na custom theme to allow people to create content from the front-end\n(P2-esk).\nWe then need some kind of course management tool, like Moodle, which would\nallow us to record data on students, grades, courses etc. Any ideas whether\nthis could be created within WP/BP/bbress some how? I'm keen to keep it as\nin-house as possible, because of integrations etc. The wordpress.org plugins\nrepo is built off bbPress, so it certainly is a powerful platform...\nWhat I'm asking is; what's your thoughts on using WP for the applications\nI've described, and how would you possibly use WP for a e-learning, course\nmanagement etc facility?\nCheers,\nAlex\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20091017/6b3ab234/attachment.htm\u003e",

        "body": "Hi everyone. I'm one of the organizers of WordCampNYC, to be held at  \nBaruch College November 14-15, and I wanted to let you all know that  \nwe will have an Ed track at the event. It's getting the same amount of  \ntime as the blogger and dev tracks (and the 5 other tracks... it's a  \nbig event), and there are a couple of slots left on the program, so  \nthought I'd post here for some suggestions and/or volunteer speakers.\nJoe Ugoretz, Luke Waltzer and Mikhail Gershovich of CUNY have been  \nconsulting on topics, and will all be speaking in the Ed track, along  \nwith Jim Groom (Mary Washington), Matt Gold (CUNY Academic Commons),  \nJeremy Boggs and Dave Lester (GMU). Dave will be doing a live setup of  \na course site with the Courseware plugin with an audience member in  \nneed of a course site.\nWe're also mixing things up a bit and having some people who would  \ntraditionally be at WordCamp Ed events present in the mainstream  \ntracks, to take advantage of the knowledge of the wider community and  \nform more connections between the Academic WP community and the  \nbroader open source WordPress community. Casey Bisson and Boone Gorges  \nwill be presenting in the Developer, CMS, and BuddyPress/MU tracks to  \nthis end.\nIf you are in the NYC Metro area and are using WordPress in an  \ninteresting way in an academic setting and might be interested in  \npresenting something, I'd love to hear from you. I'd especially love  \nto add a woman or two to the program, as this is the only track that  \ndoes not currently have any female speakers.\nIf you are from NYC or not too far away (and with the Acela, that's  \nreally anywhere from Boston to DC, right?), I hope you'll consider  \nattending the event. So far only about 30 people have registered and  \nindicated that they are interested in the Ed track. Given that  \nprevious WordCampEd events have pulled in 150 attendees easily, it  \nwould great to hit that level in NYC as well. The sooner people  \nregister, the easier it will be to assign rooms for the sessions. As a  \nside note, our last t-shirt order will be placed the morning of  \nNovember 4, so register before then to guarantee a t-shirt.\nThe event is only $40, lasts Saturday and Sunday from 9-6, includes a  \nlong-sleeved t-shirt and lunch on Saturday. More information about the  \nprogramming of the event can be found at the web site: http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org \n. Matt Mullenweg, founder and project lead of WordPress, will be in  \nattendance, and we're planning a roundtable discussion on the future  \nof of WordPress in educational settings with him that I think will be  \nreally great. So register! Tell your colleagues! Spread the word!\nThanks. :)\nJane Wells\nCo-organizer, WordCamp NYC",

    "body": "Is anyone using WordPress to manage student elections or nominations? The system would need to allow only students to vote (authentication from either LDAP or a pre-populated list of students) and prevent ballot stuffing while also allowing students to vote for multiple candidates/offices.\nA specific use case would be Homecoming Court nominations: enrolled students login and are presented with a list of the other students by class and can nominate up to three male and three female students per class. I have written a homegrown system for this, but it is not in WordPress and I have not created a friendly administrative back-end for it. I?d love to find a WordPress equivalent.\nThanks,\nTravis Crabtree\nWebmaster\nTusculum College\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20150824/e1f72ee0/attachment.html\u003e",

For example, in order to remove the http://www.example.com/secret/ directory, your robots.txt file would need to include:\n   User-agent: *\n   Disallow: /secret/\nIt isn't enough for the root of the directory to return a 404 status code, because it's possible for a directory to return a 404 but still serve out files underneath it.

You can test whether a directory has been blocked correctly using either the Fetch as Googlebot\u003chttp://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=158587\u003e or Test robots.txt\u003chttp://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=156449\u003e features in Webmaster Tools.\nOnly verified owners of a site can request removal of an entire site or directory in Webmaster Tools.

This plugin has been discontinued, no longer in development and no longer functioning (even in the newer \"Userthemes Revisited\") version. \nBut we had this exact need, and so have redeveloped the plugin into something we call \"Nouveau Userthemes.\"  It lets you (super admin) activate userthemes for specific sites that you choose.  Once it's activated, that specifc site owner can \"copy\" any installed theme into a usertheme, and then edit that theme freely (from within the dashboard) without affecting the site's themes or needing ftp access to your server.  \nThis approach does have extreme security risks--I mean very extreme--if you allow it for anyone except ABSOLUTELY trusted site owners.  So I'm not releasing the plugin publicly.  But if you're willing observe that caveat (and take the responsibility yourself, not blame me if it goes wrong!), I'm more than willing to share.\nLet me know off-list if you're interested and I'll be glad to send a copy with instructions.\nJoe\n-- \nJoseph Ugoretz, PhD\nAssociate Dean of Teaching, Learning and Technology\nWilliam E.

Again, this has been working fine until a few days ago.\nWe have been using the WP Google Search\u003chttps://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-search/\u003e plugin.\nIt is now working sporadically.\nIt seems to work ok in Safari and IE, but not Chrome or Firefox.\nIf I switch to using the CSE supplied code, instead of the plugin, it works ok in Chrome and Firefox but not in Safari or IE!\nI have spent four days trying to troubleshoot this. Being a one-man operation, I am out of resources and need to focus on my projects.\nHere is an example search:\nhttp://georgian.edu/search/?q=admissions\nI am currently using the CSE supplied code, and not the plugin ? so Safari and IE are having trouble.\nI have also change the Look and feel to display a search box on the page itself. (which has no issues with searching the site)\nThis tells me that there is some type of disconnect with the Wordpress search displaying the results. Again, the search box on the page itself works perfectly.\nIf you reload the page a few times, it displays the results!\nDoes anyone have any insight in getting Google CSE to work correctly within WordPress, using the built-in search?\nThank you,\nRich\n--\nRichard Berardi\nWeb Administrator\nMarketing \u0026 Communications\nGeorgian Court University\n900 Lakewood Ave.\nLakewood, NJ 08701\np: 732-987-2469\u003ctel:732-987-2469\u003e\ne: rberardi at georgian.edu\u003cmailto:rberardi at georgian.edu\u003e\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20170228/bb874466/attachment.html\u003e",

However...... not didn't seem to be optimal for what I had in\nmind (though I could be wrong).\n=20\nHere's my reasoning:   It seems to suggest that it stores each \"table\"\nthat you create ( I guess for re-use purposes) and then you reference\nthat table in your post/page using a special shortcode.  =20\nAm I correct in this?    If so, that might work for some situations, but\nI'm thinking that most times you'd want the actual content in the table\nto be stored in the actual post/page and not simply hitting a reference\nto where it's stored somewhere else.   What if someone removes the\nactual table data in the \"plugin\" backend - or deinstalled the plugin\n(or it stops working due to a upgrade or the plugin dev. Stops...)\n=20\nWhat I'm pursuing is simply a way to generate the html needed for\nformatting in the front-end editor - thus, even if the editor plugin I\nuse to do this function \"goes away\", breaks, or I deinstall it, the\ncontent in the page/post is not dependent on it - since it's just\nstandard HTML.    =20\n=20\nThanks,\n=20\nDave\n=20\n=20\nDavid K.

That might work for us too.\nLong term I think we are moving toward using PermitPress (http://permitpress.com) for this and other membership/group solutions.  PermitPress was developed by the same guy that made RoleScoper, but it is much more powerful.  It is a new product, but has a good community forming.  An update that is due out soon will protect media attached to content items in the same way that you protect the item.  Very nice.  That way it is all in wordpress and easily managed by us and our users.\nThanks for all the thoughts and suggestions.  This (roles and group management) is a really a big thing that I think we are all so close to figuring out. :)  As an aside we have a large site with lots of sub-groups that need their own rights and we are going to manage it all through wordpress.

        "body": "I belatedly realized I had basically repeated what Mark had already written when he wrote:\n\"This is correct - our ACL plugin generates .htaccess files for ACL'd media.  However I should point out that this works in our case because we also bypass ms-files.php for serving uploads, and let Apache serve files directly.  If your uploads are coming from ms-files.php (typical behavior), I don't think this approach would work without a new hook in ms-files.php to test access to the file being requested.\"\nThere's no hope for there ever being a hook into ms-files.php -- because SHORTINIT gets defined as true, it does a very basic initialization without defining any actions that can be hooked into. So I made a copy of the file that does do a full initialization and put it in my plugin folder. Then I added a field to the Edit Media and Upload Media forms that lets a user pick a predefined rule to use to restrict access to it. '/protected' is then inserted into the guid value for the file between the blog and file paths (not ideal, but I couldn't find a better way). I added\nRewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?protected/(.+) wp-content/plugins/vcu_access_control/protected.php?file=$2 [L]\nto the .htaccess file, and added a check to the modified ms-files.php copy (protected.php) for the relevant rule: if the test passes, the file gets delivered; if not, it returns a 401 (could be a 404). You can remove a rule from the uploaded file, and the '/protected' is removed, so it's handled like a normal file. There's a little more to it than that, but that's the gist.\nI should add that the impetus for this on our end comes from a number of requests to create access restrictions by LDAP group, university department or affiliation, etc., without requiring that every member of such a group be added as a user to a specific site at any role level. When a file is restricted, a visitor is forced to log in through CAS, and I'm using phpCAS to check these attributes. I had initially set up a version that involved mod_auth_cas, mod_authnz_ldap and location matches, but this way, I don't have to touch the Apache conf files every time someone wants a restricted site -- the site administrator creates the rules, and access should be in sync with a user's latest university attributes. I kind of put the cart before the horse, as I'm just now getting back to the rule creation component of the plugin, but it's working so far with requiring a valid sign-in or any user on a list. \nJonathan Cox\nVCU Webmaster\nTechnology Services\n(804) 827-0067\nOn Jun 1, 2012, at 11:16 AM, Shawn Miller wrote:\n\u003e Not sure if this is helpful - but we've been recommending that people use Sakai for files that need to be truly private (as a stopgap measure for now anyway).

        "body": "Hi Alex,\nIt's a really good question and I think the idea of collecting experiences to compare and contrast and maybe find some common lessons is a terrific idea.\nOur situation here at Macaulay is a bit anomalous, but I'll still be glad to describe it.  And I have been involved at least marginally in the planning and implementation of the CUNY Academic Commons, so I'll comment on that, too, with the hope that Matt Gold or Boone or someone with more of a leadership role in the project will jump in and amplify and correct.  And I'll challenge Jim Groom to jump in, with his stories, and Luke Waltzer from Baruch with his (very much in progress) stories.  Maybe Michael Smith or Michael Cripps can tell us something about how it's gone at York College, too.\nLet me start with Macaulay.  Because we're a part of a larger university (CUNY) we have some of the same struggles with less-than-cooperative, security-over-usability, enterprise-over-education, philosophies from the IT department that other folks have had.  But because we're also a somewhat independent, small, cross-campus unit of that larger university, we can be flexible enough to avoid some of those struggles.  We first implemented WordPress in 2008 as an eportfolio platform (adding BuddyPress the next year) and that was really my original vision of what it would be. \nBut almost immediately, because of the flexibility of the platform, and because of other factors (notably a widespread dissatisfaction among faculty with the university's LMS--Blackboard--and then a long-lasting, unexplained, technical failure of Blackboard access right when classes most needed it), faculty and students began asking to use, or just using, WordPress for all kinds of different purposes.  Everything from just the most basic class website use (posting syllabus and schedule and readings) to a full-fledged LMS.  From club publications and student newspapers, to study-abroad blogs or poetry or graphic design collaboration sites.  And of course for eportfolios, as well.\nWe avoided some of the issues that worry IT departments by having the install on a separate server, outsourced, and very intentionally NOT linking it to any kind of single-signon, Active Directory, or LDAP.  That made things like course-setup and student enrollment in the system a little more difficult...but only a little.  And it was a better fit philosophically for what we wanted to accomplish--more of a do-it-yourself ethos where students enroll themselves and manage their own passwords and accounts.  All of this happened with a tiny IT staff--basically, for the first year or so, it was me alone.  And it's still mainly just me, and not at all my full-time role.\nI think the biggest factor that made it a success was that we just did it, got it installed and started, and then let faculty and students start using the system.  I did some promotion (and our Instructional Technology Fellows were a big help with this), but the main road to acceptance came from people seeing examples of success and then saying \"I want to be part of that.  I want to try something like that.\"\nThen there's the case of the CUNY Academic Commons.  There we had some degree of official IT acceptance and support right from the beginning, but again it was more a matter of building first, on a separate server not managed by the central IT, not linked to any of their secure systems, and then letting success grow from success. The Commons is a little bit of a different beast because (at least at present) it is generally not open to undergraduate classes or students.  It's only for faculty, staff, administrators and graduate students (mostly, I would say, faculty and grad students--which are often the same thing).  So that alleviated right from the start some of the concerns that IT departments sometimes have.  Like I said, I hope Matt or Boone or someone will give more details about that, but I think the main lesson was a similar kind of DIY and pioneering approach is the way to get started.  Not waiting for official permission or sanction, but building a successful system in whatever kind of separate or easily-managed controlled environment you can manage, and then getting the official support later.  \nIt seems you just need to take whatever window or small niche you can find to get going, then you can present to the central IT folks a fait accompli, already working and successful and secure...and with a strong user base in place who would not settle for being told \"no.\"  It wasn't a matter of a lone voice in the wilderness: \"why can't we have WordPress!\" but a chorus of successful users \"we are so happy to have WordPress, let's get it more integrated and supported!\"\nI know that Blogs at Baruch (again, I hope Luke will say more) started small and limited, and now have moved to much wider acceptance and usage and impact in the institution as a whole, and I know that Jim started UMW Blogs on a separate server, a separate hosting account (a .org, in fact, not even an official college site, right Jim?), and it was only after he had the success that he got the official acceptance and welcoming.\nYou do need (at least) one dedicated, friendly, daring administrator or sponsor right from the start.  Someone who's going to either sign off, help out, or at least look the other way.  But I honestly think it's OK (maybe even preferable) to start with a slightly outlaw flavor.  That may be stating it too strongly--\"alternative\" might be better than \"outlaw.\"  \nI don't mean to minimize the political or administrative risks here--that's why it helps to have that high-level sponsor or collaborator.  And you do need to be for real about security and privacy and backups and staffing and scalability.  You have to know your stuff and have answers for the questions that will come.  If things look amateurish or unsafe, or even worse, if they actually are unsafe, you're never going to make a breakthrough.\nBut I think it is possible, in many institutions, to get past the institutional inertia and caution (some of which is actually reasonable).  The spreadsheet Kevin Willarty linked is good evidence of that.  If you start a small project, maybe for one department or one area of the college, one place where you can have control and the risks don't seem forbidding, you can definitely grow from there.\nI went on too long, here, didn't I? But of course happy to discuss more.\nJoe\n \n-- \nJoseph Ugoretz, PhD\nAssociate Dean of Teaching, Learning and Technology\nMacaulay Honors College - CUNY\n35 West 67th St.\nNew York, NY 10023\n212.729.2920\nhttp://macaulay.cuny.edu\nOn Jul 5, 2011, at 10:08 PM, Alexandre Enkerli wrote:\n\u003e Hi,\n\u003e \n\u003e Been using WP in diverse contexts, including some of my activities as\n\u003e an instructor.\n\u003e After talking with diverse people needing advice about Web solutions\n\u003e for all sorts of things, I came to the realization that it'd be\n\u003e incredibly useful to have a university-supported install of WordPress\n\u003e (Multi-Site and hopefully BuddyPress-enabled).\n\u003e \n\u003e It's a big institution, so it can be difficult to request such things.\n\u003e Actually, the communications department is in the RFP phase of\n\u003e implementing a new (commercial) CMS, so energies are spent elsewhere.\n\u003e \n\u003e We use Moodle as the main course management system for most of the\n\u003e community, though the business school uses FirstClass for the same\n\u003e purposes.

They tend to have various room sizes, projectors, etc. and are \nusually easy to get to. Since academia is a growing area of WordPress \nuse, it frequently happens that hosting a WordCamp at a college campus \nis possible because someone at the college wanted to be involved in \nbringing a WordCamp to their school. A faculty member who wants his/her \ndepartment to host/sponsor a WordCamp has built-in access to facilities \nand services, while an outside organizer would be handed off to \nconference rentals, when what is usually appealing about campuses is the \nclassroom format.\nWhy am I telling you this? If you are on this list, chances are you're \nusing WordPress in an academic setting. Some WordCamps, like New York \nCity, feature an academic track due to close collaboration with college \npersonnel, and I'd like to see this trend continue.\nIf you work for a college with a campus that would make a good setting \nfor a WordCamp and would be interested in getting involved, let me know. \nI can try to put you together with local people who are also interested \nin organizing a WordCamp.

If you're the single user, it can be assumed that you trust\n\u003e yourself.\n\u003e\n\u003e In multisite, though, that option does work fine.  WordPress does utilize\n\u003e it, without any plugins, or at least it always has in our install.  We can\n\u003e add new file types to that list, and files of that type can then be\n\u003e uploaded.  Or conversely, when we remove file types from that list, they\n\u003e can no longer be uploaded.\n\u003e\n\u003e So if that's not working for you, there must be something else wrong.\n\u003e  Maybe php settings?\n\u003e\n\u003e If everything's functioning as it should, as it's designed to, that list\n\u003e of acceptable file types is workable and effective.\n\u003e\n\u003e Joe\n\u003e\n\u003e --\n\u003e Joseph Ugoretz, PhD\n\u003e Associate Dean of Teaching, Learning and Technology Macaulay Honors\n\u003e College - CUNY\n\u003e 35 West 67th St.\n\u003e New York, NY 10023\n\u003e 212.729.2920\n\u003e http://macaulay.cuny.edu\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e On May 10, 2012, at 11:21 AM, Whisler, Dave wrote:\n\u003e\n\u003e I need to know the best way to add/remove items from the list of\n\u003e acceptable file types (file extensions) that are permitted in WordPress\n\u003e 3.x.x.\n\u003e\n\u003e Standard WordPress (non-multisite):  It does not have any options to\n\u003e add/remove file from the WP Dashboard.\n\u003e WP MultiSite Installation:  If you go into the network admin Dashboard, it\n\u003e has a field that has a list of acceptable file types here:   Dashboard -\u003e\n\u003e Settings -\u003e Network Settings -\u003e  \"Upload file types\".

In my experience, there are usually a number of\ndisparate systems which may or may not work together; much like\nacademics, some of who choose to use the tools provided and many, who\ndo their own thing.\nThere are a number of ways that WordPress records information for\naudit: highly queriable MySQL data, LDAP integration (if used), RSS \u0026\nAtom feeds for all content, and XML dumps that can be performed by\nusers at any time. In addition, each time the 'save' or 'publish'\nbutton is hit, a new time-stamped revision is recorded against a user\nprofile. Backed up nightly, the data is available for audit at any\ntime. A simple 'wget -r' command will download a WordPress website in\nits entirety for archiving in an Institutional Repository.\nThe UK Government seem happy to use it, too. For example:\nhttp://www.number10.gov.uk/ (The Prime Minister's official website)\nhttp://blogs.dfid.gov.uk/ (Department for International Development)\nhttp://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/ (The Wales Office - official\nrepresentation for Wales in UK central government)\nhttp://www.ournhs.nhs.uk/ (National Health Service reform)\nhttp://governance.justice.gov.uk/ (Ministry of Justice)\nJoss\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Sat 11/8/2008 09:25\nTo: wp-edu@lists.automattic.com\nI am surprised to hear that Wordpress would be implemented in\nUniversities.  In the UK and Australia and I suspect other\njurisdictions the record keeping requirements on Universities are\nonerous -- primarily as a result of direct and indirect legislative\nrequirements (for instance, Records FOI, Privacy acts etc).\nI can how Wordpress and associated tools would be of use in relation\nto facilitating conversations across Universites.  But as far as I can\ngather there is not a record keeping module for Wordpress -- to allow\neasy porting into common electronic document management software.\nEssentially every time a user hit publish or comment they would be\neither creating a new record or a new version of an existing record.\nWithout a link to University electronic document management systems\ninstitutional websites would seem crazy brave.\nJohn Blahusiak\nPolicy and Project Officer, Governance Services\nGovernance and Planning Services, Edith Cowan University\nThis e-mail is confidential.

    "body": "images?\nHello wp-edu,\nI'm trying to make charts and graphs that we post on our WP blog accessible, and think ahead so that we format information in a way that doesn't make us do backwards-compatible accessibility after the fact. The charts in question are too complex to be described in alt text, making a longer description necessary.\nI've found a very helpful post about 25 Ways to Make Your WordPress Website More Accessible\u003chttp://wpmu.org/25-ways-to-make-your-wordpress-website-more-accessible/\u003e that suggests using the \u003chttp://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/long-description-for-image-attachments/\u003e Long Description\u003chttp://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/long-description-for-image-attachments/\u003e plugin. However, the longdesc attribute is deprecated in HTML5 (though there appears to be much controversy about that), so I'm not sure that is a long term solution.\nWebAIM suggests three options for creating accessible images\u003chttp://webaim.org/techniques/images/longdesc\u003e:\n 1.  Provide the long description in the context of the document itself.\n 2.  Provide a link to a long description via a normal text link.\n 3.  Provide a link to a long description via the longdesc attribute.\nMy question is, how do options these translate to WordPress?\nRight now, we're uploading a .txt file of the long description to the Media Library and putting a \u003ca href=\"local link to file.txt\"\u003eText description\u003c/a\u003e link to that file under the chart (option 2 above). When clicked, the text file displays in the browser.\nI'm not sure that is the most elegant or accessible solution, however, and would welcome input and suggestions.  How are you all handling this?\nThanks!\nJenn Stevens\nCreative Instructional Designer\nEmerson College\n403B Walker Building\n120 Boylston St\nBoston MA 02116\n(617) 824-3093",

There is an alternative Miniorange SAML Plugin (\nhttps://wordpress.org/plugins/miniorange-saml-20-single-sign-on/) which\nworks with Shibboleth Idp and is compartively easy to setup and is well\nmaintained. You need a Pro version for multisite, however their licensing\nis a bit of an issue due to per site license policy.\nI am in agreement that the plugin is less maintained, however it still\nsolves the purpose well for allowing Shibboleth authentication. It does\nrequires extra setup and config on server level initially and should be\ngood to go later. I have scanned through the pull requests and they are\ngood to have in the plugin and would recommend forking the repo and keep a\ntrack of changes or new pull requests on the original github repo. That is\nhow we keep this plugin maintained for ourselves. We are working on few\ncustomizations of ours as well and might send in pull requests for others\ninterested. One such use case is to restrict/disallow a certain set of\nusers from Shibboleth to access our wordpress service.\nI am happy to discuss more if someone needs additional information related\nto this.\nBest,\nNeel\nNeel Shah\nInformation Technology Specialist\nNew York University\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20160906/7f20c3eb/attachment.html\u003e",

    "body": "Hi all, below is some investigation from one of our vendors about utilizing\nGoogle Analytics across our entire multi-site network. I am not a GA\nexpert, but somewhat familiar. Maybe there is just something fundamental to\nGA that I am not understanding. I was hoping to have it be as simple as\n?install once, all analytics?. Does anyone have any experience with this,\nand what is/isn?t possible? The results from testing below indicate we may\nhave to do 1 GA code (or tracking ID) per site in order to track properly.\nOur network is sub-dirs off of http://wp.comminfo.rutgers.edu/, but a good\nportion of sites have their own domains.\nI also thought these results would be useful for other people considering\nhow to implement analytics.\nRe: Investigate using Google Analytics on multi-site (John Bowen )\n\u003eFrom the to-do list: Tasks for YWD\nOn Friday, to get some idea of how Domain Mapping would work in relation to\nGoogle Analytics, I set up my test WordPress network as follows\nNetwork websites\n- wordpress.yardleywebdesign.com\n- wordpress.yardleywebdesign.com/test\n- wordpress.yardleywebdesign.com/johngbowen\n- wordpress.yardleywebdesign.com/gfh\nI loaded the WordPress plugins Google Analytics Dashboard for WP and\nWordPress MU Domain Mapping (from WPENGINE).   I used the WPENGINE plugin\nfor the moment as it was free and had less options.  Initially I just\nnetwork activated the Google Analytics plugin.  In my Google Analytics\naccount, I added another property (wordpress.yardleywebdesign.com) and it\ngave me a new tracking ID (actually the same as yardleywebdesign.com with a\n-2 instead of -1).  In the Google Analytics plugin I set it up to use a\nsingle Google Analytics account for all sites (Mode 2) and loaded the new\nTracking ID.\nWhile watching Google Analytics through the Real-Time Overview feature, as\nI clicked through the various websites and their pages, I could see the\ncorresponding pages show up (without the wordpress.yardleywebdesign.com\nprefix) in the Top Active Pages section.  So root pages were showing as /,\n/test/, /johngbowen/ and /gfh/.   The data from all of the sites was\ncorrectly being funneled in to the one Google Analytics account.\nNext, I network activated  the Domain Mapping plugin and did all of the\nnecessary setup.  Through this setup I mapped\nwordpress.yardleywebdesign.com/gfh to an unused domain that I own in my\nhosting account, golfersfromhell.org.   Once the set up was complete, I\nverified that typing wordpress.yardleywebdesign.com/gfh in the browser\nwindow correctly took me to the right site and the website url now read\ngolfersfromhell.org.  I also typed golfersfromhell.org in the browser and\nverified that it took me to the same website page.\nAgain looking at Google Analytics in the same manner, all of the page views\nwere showing.  However, where previously, before Domain Mapping was turned\non, page views to any pages on wordpress.yardleywebdesign.com/gfh were\nshowing with the prefex /gfh/ followed by the page name, now they were\nshowing as simply the page name (no prefix).  So accessing the main page of\nwordpress.yardleywebdesign.com and wordpress.yardleywebdesign.com/gfh (\ngolfersfromhell.org) would both shows as /.   So with the basic setup,\nthere does not appear to be a way to distinguish between visits to the wp\nroot site (id-1) and the root page for any site that is domain mapped.\nThis would also be the case if any of the inner pages have the same url.\nThere is a way to use different Analytics IDs for each site (-1, -2, etc.)\nand have that data link back up in to one account.  It does involve editing\nthe GA code within each site which might be difficult.  I'm also not if the\ndata would show any differently.  But I can look in to this method further\nor see if there is some other way to configure GA and Domain Mapping such\nthat each of the sites can be identified in the GA display.\n---------------------------------\nBEN BAKELAAR | IT Services\nSchool of Communication and Information\nRutgers, The State University of New Jersey\np 848.932.8710\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20150914/80c2cf96/attachment.html\u003e",

        "body": "Hi, I just recently joined the wp-edu list and got your comments on the \nScholarpress plugin.  I was very excited to see that others were trying \nto use Wordpress for courses beyond kb-gradebook.\nI installed it on my ESL/EFL site and went to configure it to discover \nthat it was more of a reference tool for offline classes than a plugin \ndesigned for giving courses completely online using Wordpress. I'm not \nsaying it is bad. I found what it does very interesting even though it \nis not what I've been looking for.\nI have been working on my own  testing \u0026 gradebook plugin with the goal \nof teaching online so the quiz scores get posted to the gradebook as \nsoon as a test is taken not something that requires a CSV file or other \nmanual entry.\nI still have to try to set up course descriptions and homework schedules \nfor mine so I was very interested in checking out Scholar press.  I only \nsaw the option to set up one course description and the scheduling seems \nto be for fixed dates.\nI'd like homework scheduling and all related tasks to be flexible for \ndays from enrollment so I could have students starting on different \ndays, but their assignments and tasks would be different because they \nare in different stages yet it would be manageable since it would be \nfollowing a syllabus.\nWhile Kb-gradebook is ideal for an off-line course to post grades, it is \nimpractical for true online classes to force the teacher to go through \nthat busy work of manually updating a csv and uploading it instead of \ncreating his or her course content online and adding grades as needed.\nI have also been trying to use Moodle (after trying Atutor) to design a \ncourse over much of the last year, but I find its administration to be \nmore than frustrating which is why I've gone to programming my own \nplugins for Wordpress which I already know and can use for content \nmanagement. This way at least I can have something up and working for \npeople to use even if it only serves the testing and gradebook function.\nI'm curious how much conflict there is in design and planning of plugins \nfrom the off-line course resource to the completely online course. I'm \nalso curious about how much teachers who normally give courses off-line \nbring their fixed-exact-date-linear thinking to their online course design.\nAre there any AJAX programmers on the list? I'd like to extend my \ntesting to include adding javascript based quizzes (drag and drop, \nordering, matching), but I don't know how to take the results and pass \nthem to a PHP script for processing.\nChristopher\nOn 4/3/2010 6:22 PM, Stas Su?cov wrote:\n\u003e During the last #wordpress-gsoc chat, Jane pointed me to the\n\u003e ScholarPress, a community of WordPress plugins developers that are\n\u003e writing code to make WordPress useful in education.

    "body": "Hi all,\nI was reading other threads in this list about your projects, so I\nhave some questions for all people that want to use WP for educational\npurposes. Just for curiosity and share our experiences.\nI'm currently involved in an educational project with the University\nof Naples \"Federico II\" in Italy. We currently use WP to support the\neducational activities in 52 courses - basically with lessons posted\non the site, enriched with images, videos, links, podcasts, downadable\ndocuments (pdf, zip, ppt etc...).\nIn the first release (september 2007) we choose to not allow the\nstudents to post comments and interact with teachers (comments are\nclosed). But the next release, (probably in the first week of next\nmonth) will have more than 100 new courses and for each course we'll\ngive a little community, where registered students can comment the\nlessons, do surveys on course topics, stay tuned with classroom news\nand post links to web resources (papers, videos, web sites etc...)\nMy questions for you are:\nWhat are the WordPress features that you think be useful for your projects?\nYou want to build a community of teachers and students, give a blog to\nevery student, let students post articles?\nWhat type of interaction do you think is the best for a good\neducational project?\nAt the moment WP - a simple installation of WP - allows only comments.\nIt's ok for you or you need more?\nFor your needs is better WordPress Mu? Or you need custom features?\nDo you have already considered to use other platforms (Joomla, Drupal,\nMoodle...) and why do you think that WP is more suitable for you?\nThanks in advance,\n(and sorry for my awful english)\nClaudio",

        "subject": "[wp-edu] What features and what kind of use do you need?",
        "body": "Claudio,\nWelcome!\nHere are my thoughts in response to your questions.\n\u003e What are the WordPress features that you think be useful for your projects?\nObviously, posting and commenting are the things that really make\nWordPress what it is and they help in education too. Flexible themes\nand user options and the wide array of plugins available for WordPress\ncreate essentially unlimited opportunities. There are a lot of ways to\norganize content using tags and categories, which can be really useful\nas well.\n\u003e You want to build a community of teachers and students, give a blog to\n\u003e every student, let students post articles?\nI think it depends on the intention of the class and of the\nimplementation of blogging. Do you want to provide students with a\nmedium to showcase some of their writing or do you want to expose them\nto blogging in full force? If you want to do the later, students and\nteachers getting their own blog is most appropriate. If you want to do\nthe former, then one blog could probably serve the needs of the\nproject. I think it boils down to this: do you want the blog/project\nto have one voice or many?\n\u003e What type of interaction do you think is the best for a good\n\u003e educational project?\nComments are great. WordPress is improving commenting and it is\ndefinitely on the agenda. Contact forms obviously offer a more\ntraditional form of communication and interaction. And of course,\nstudents and teachers can respond to other students and teachers via\nblog posts if the blog or project is setup that way. Commenting in the\nway of linking to another post and adding your own thoughts is a great\nway to take advantage of blogging for education.\n\u003e At the moment WP - a simple installation of WP - allows only comments.\n\u003e It's ok for you or you need more?\nYou do a lot more than just comment with a simple WordPress\ninstallation. I talked about some of the features in your first\nquestion and I think one of the most prominent features is the ability\nto easily install plugins. There are so many plugins available and\nwith them, you can do so much that it is unbelievable.\n\u003e For your needs is better WordPress Mu? Or you need custom features?\nWe just had another discussion about WordPress MU versus a regular\ninstallation of WordPress. Here is a link to our archives:\nhttp://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-edu/2008-November/thread.html\n\u003e Do you have already considered to use other platforms (Joomla, Drupal,\n\u003e Moodle...) and why do you think that WP is more suitable for you?\nI personally haven't used any other content management systems or blog\nsoftware since I started using WordPress.\nHopefully this is helpful! Again, welcome to the wp-edu list.\n--\nDouglas Hanna\nAutomattic | WordPress.com\nBlog: http://www.serviceuntitled.com",

The latest version of the plugin fixes this  \nproblem.\n==nextGen Gallery: Ignoring MultiSite directory options==\nnextGen  Gallery has issues with WordPress 3.0 multisite. While  \nexisting installations are working ok, folks who add the plugin after  \nthe upgrade get this error message:\n?Directory wp-content/gallery/ didn?t exist. Please create first the  \nmain gallery folder !?\nThe problem is that Blog Directory Path, which is a network-wide  \noption set under the super admin menu, is no longer being respected at  \nthe per site level by nextGen. If you manually set the site?s  \ndirectory path using the site?s ID (available from the main site  \ndirectory list in the super admin view), then things work properly,  \nbut the default setting is now incorrect.\nThe plugin author is aware of the problem, and is working on this and  \nother MultiSite-specific  issues for the next release.\nhttp://wordpress.org/support/topic/412008?replies=7\nhttp://code.google.com/p/nextgen-gallery/issues/detail?id=286\n==nextGen Gallery: Slideshow links don't work on a static home page==\nIf you insert a nextGen Gallery into a page, and then make that page  \nyour home page, the link to the slideshow will not work.\n==Anarchy Media Player==\nAnarchy's settings page no longer loads under WordPress 3.0.\n==Mandigo (theme)==\nThe Mandigo setting page doesn't load if you're using Mandigo 1.40.1.  \nIt works properly with the current version.\n==Mandigo + nextGen + WordPress 3.0==\nHere's a very specific bug -- Mandigo uses an older version of JQuery  \nin its theme, one that doesn't include a particular method that  \nnextGen needs.

In particular, I'm wondering how the API key scaled up.

    "body": "Loren,\n \nThanks for the suggestion to try WP-Table-Reloaded, but I had seen that\none previously and opted not to try it.   \nI saw that this plugin is pretty popular and so thought it  might work\nfor me.   However...... not didn't seem to be optimal for what I had in\nmind (though I could be wrong).\n \nHere's my reasoning:   It seems to suggest that it stores each \"table\"\nthat you create ( I guess for re-use purposes) and then you reference\nthat table in your post/page using a special shortcode.   \nAm I correct in this?    If so, that might work for some situations, but\nI'm thinking that most times you'd want the actual content in the table\nto be stored in the actual post/page and not simply hitting a reference\nto where it's stored somewhere else.   What if someone removes the\nactual table data in the \"plugin\" backend - or deinstalled the plugin\n(or it stops working due to a upgrade or the plugin dev. Stops...)\n \nWhat I'm pursuing is simply a way to generate the html needed for\nformatting in the front-end editor - thus, even if the editor plugin I\nuse to do this function \"goes away\", breaks, or I deinstall it, the\ncontent in the page/post is not dependent on it - since it's just\nstandard HTML.     \n \nThanks,\n \nDave\n \n \nDavid K.

I set up WPMU at the university where I work in May\nand have been slowly accumulating users through word-of-mouth.\nhttp://learninglab.lincoln.ac.uk/blogs/\nI've just started the first round of formal advocacy to Snr. Management,\ntrying to get it accepted on a wider, institutional level and the response\nso far has been supportive but understandably cautious. I am optimistic\nthough. \nIdeally, I'd like to set up http://community.lincoln.ac.uk (dead link) and\nhave BuddyPress layered over the blogs. I think that would appeal to a wider\naudience and also allow us to brand the BuddyPress Social Networking layer\nwhile still offering completely customisable blogs to individual users. I'm\nless optimistic about this being accepted, but we'll see. Everyone here\nrecognises the potential of using WordPress for staff profile web sites,\ncollaborative web publishing, marketing, teaching and learning.\nWhat complicates it slightly for us is that historically the ITC dept. are\nvery much a Microsoft shop and it's questionable whether we can\nrealistically support a large (potentially. 10,000 blog) installation of\nWPMU. My plan is to look for reliable pool of freelance support. Our current\ninstallation is on a Linux server which I run and as long as I don't hassle\nanyone too often, I am king of that domain. There are obviously pros and\ncons to this approach.\nAlso, we've only just switched to Blackboard for our VLE and some people are\nconcerned that WPMU would distract from the roll out of the new VLE and\nconfuse people about the appropriate use of each system.\nAnyway, that's my short story. I'm interested in hearing about any other\nstories relating to advocacy and roll out of WordPress in education.\nCheers\nJoss \n-- \nTechnology Officer\nCentre for Educational Research and Development\nUniversity of Lincoln\nBrayford Pool\nLincoln\nLN67TS\nUK\nT: +44-1522-886759\nhttp://learninglab.lincoln.ac.uk/blogs/joss",

Sorta depends on you needs.\nIf you want 'rock solid plain vanilla' It's hard to go past the default twentyten and twentyeleven themes.\nI have used twentyten for a local community group at http://kiamabug.org.au that is used successfully by complete novices for updating new articles, photos, etc.\nBlogolife is another that I have used for another group here in Kiama - http://kiamatennis.org.au - which is pretty plain, has plenty of options, but does the job for those who want to add content without needing too much expertise in maintaining a site.\nAnother theme that might be worth a look is Suffusion. Again, a zillion options. Example at http://www.sthgrafton-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/\nHope this helps (I am sure that you will receive a stack of suggestions - everyone has a favorite!)\nWarren\nOn 22/04/2012, at 5:43 AM, Bob Marteal \u003crtm9 at cornell.edu\u003e wrote:\n\u003e Hi,\n\u003e \n\u003e I'm looking for recommendations for a rock-solid plain vanilla wordpress theme.

    "body": "All,\nImpressed by and grateful for all the thoughtful responses to my query about\ngetting acceptance for a WordPress instance on campus. Very useful advice\nand important cautionary tales.\nMore specifically, it helps me situate my university in that context. In\nsome ways, resistance is less rigid than in some of your cases. Key people\nare trying to listen to all of these arguments, and they are open to some\ninitiatives. At the same time, there's a chilling effect related to fears\nabout potential legal issues which not only creates distortion in the\nconversation but makes it difficult to integrate social media projects with\nother activities.\nAnd social media is really what we're talking about, in our case. Not only\nblogs, podcasts, and microblogging, but social networking, user-generated\ncontent, and even ?cloud computing?. WP can help with all of these but the\nfears come from issues with commercial services.\nAnd this where things take an interesting turn.\nMany people at the university are using a variety of social media services.\nAt our institution, people are struggling with policies and guidelines to\nadopt, in order to prevent all sorts of issues having to do with privacy,\ncopyright, branding, security, etc. While there are diverse initiatives to\nuse social media in relation to university work (including community\noutreach, teaching, and research), the ?official word? tends to be that\nproper authorities should be notified. Obviously, nobody has a way to\nmonitor what members of the university community are doing on Twitter,\nFacebook, or even WordPress.com?\nAnd we happen to be a community-oriented institution. It?d make so much\nsense to connect with the local community through social media!\nNow, the search for a university-wide CMS allegedly does include several\nthings about social media. But it?ll be a long process and it?s one which\ndoesn?t really involve members of the community.\nThis is probably where I?m not framing the issue properly. As diverse people\nhave explained, getting a WP instance on campus should probably start from a\nmodest initiative. With some technical support (I?m not skilled or\ncredentialed enough to do much), individual initiatives could work well and\neventually spread more broadly.\nWe?ll see how things go.\nIn the meantime, very sincere thanks for all your help. Further proof that\nthe WP community is friendly and helpful. Honestly, I?m touched.\n--\nAlex Enkerli\nhttp://enkerli.com/\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20110708/a31c1cd8/attachment.htm\u003e",

Editing a shared term\nresults in a duplication of the term. As it requires careful\nsynchronization when terms are modified, global terms get very messy very\nquickly. We more or less deprecated the global terms feature when MU was\nmerged into 3.0 ? it still exists, but it is turned off by default. To turn\nit off (if you're not using it otherwise), you can change the\nglobal_terms_enabled value in sitemeta to 0, or do add_filter(\n'global_terms_enabled', '__return_false' );. Once you turn it off, terms\nwill stop being synced, and will become less \"in sync\" over time.\nObviously, turning it back on isn't really feasible, at least not without a\nlot of non-shared properties.\nGlobal terms aren't the issue here, though. That's just background for what\nis occurring.\nInstead what I would do is store all of your taxonomy data in a file. So,\nyou have an array of terms for each taxonomy, etc. Then you, in code, store\na global \"version\" of this taxonomy data, i.e. version 1. Then, when you\ncreate a site, the terms get created based on the definitions in the file,\nand an option is added to that site's options table saying that its\ntaxonomy data version is 1.\nWhen you want to add or edit a term, you add the new one to the array.\nDelete or edit, remove the old one. And then for edits, you have a second\narray of mapping the old term to the new term. Then you bump the version to\n2.\nOn admin_init (for every site), you check the version number in the DB. If\nit's less than the one in the file, you initiate an upgrade, based on what\nneeds to be added, edited, or renamed. This can also apply for modifying\ndescriptions, etc. Once done, you bump the version number to 2.\nYou don't need to store everything in the file, but it would be nicer than\na switch_to_blog(1) to get that blog's taxonomy information. And, if\nimplementing this, it would make sense to disallow\nediting/managing/deleting terms for everyone, from any site, except for a\nsuper admin on the main site (where the canonical information, ideally,\nwould be kept).\nIf you're familiar with the internals of WP, this approach may sound\nfamiliar. The routine is what WordPress does to update the DB ? it keeps a\nDB version in version.php and in the options table, and compares them in\nadmin.php. It does this for multisite too, but you can force an update\nacross the entire network from the Update Network screen in the network\nadmin.\nCheers,\nNacin\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20120317/f6ddddfb/attachment.htm\u003e",

When a user's account disappeared from the system for\nwhatever reason, the first thing it would do is simply make the blog\ninvisible, causing the blog to effectively disappear completely without\nactually touching any of its content. It set a flag in a database table\nmaking a note of when that happened. Some amount of time later (90 days, I\nthink) it would call another piece of custom code someone else wrote that\nwould export the blog's contents, pack it up into a tarball, and shove it\ninto a long-term archive directory just in case someone came back to us\nscreaming for it (which never actually happened while I was there).

There were thousands of dormant blogs with\n9 database tables each, and three files per table (we used the MyISAM\ndatabase engine in MySQL). This amounted to hundreds of thousands of files.\nEven this absurd level of cruft had minimal impact, though. The only\npractical issues it caused were that rsyncs took an absurdly long time due\nto the sheer number of files, and the mysqldump utility was absolutely\nunable to cope with that many tables in a single database.

For some time now, it's been WP, but this comparison helps me dig into the criteria and continue to make the best recommendation.) \nThe document is public, and there are 6 sheets focusing on Software, Production, Publishing, Collaboration, Events, and Forms:\n\t\u003chttp://bit.ly/Mx7wuM\u003e\nI'm currently in the midst of my annual update. However, although I have current WP experience, I have not worked deeply with Drupal 7 yet. If you or a colleague have been using Drupal 7 in production for a school, college, or university, would you be willing to take a look at the comparison sheets and add your knowledge about the features that are supported in core and modules? This will work on the honor system, and I'll keep an eye on revisions and annotations if there is disagreement.\nAlso, the lists of colleges and universities using WordPress and Drupal are here; I hope you'll update your own school's entry:\n\tWordPress: \u003chttp://bit.ly/IMh151\u003e\n\tDrupal: \u003chttp://bit.ly/eMz36b\u003e\nThanks, in advance, for taking the time.\n-Jay\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20120720/8f4966ae/attachment.htm\u003e",

Is there a specific place where I can put the game folder on the multi-site server? Or do we need to have the game folder on a different server?\n\u003e\nHi Darcy (and wp-edu list) ... i actually got hosed on this issue two\nor three years back with a church client multisite site set up in that\nWP tripped over the dynamic applications and caused them not to fire\n...\nthus the short answer = name your game folders something that will\nnever be a part of your WP category, tag, or page names ... otherwise,\nif your game resides in a folder that shares similar WP category, tag\nor page name then the htaccess rules will prevail and your game files\nbomb ...\nnote to answer = this might be different if you install WP in a sub\ndirectory versus root install ... my experience was from WP installed\nin root as when it came out (circa 3.0) that was the only option but i\nbelieve as of 3.5 you can now install WP in a sub directory so if that\nis the case you might get a different experience ..??..\nbackground to my experience ... my church client had five or six\nsubsites on the WP network - e.g., the primary site for the parish\noffice for all the contact us, mass schedule, bulletins, etc ...\nanother site for photos so other editors and youth group folks could\nadd all the photos they wanted ... another site for members of\ncongregation to converse ala facebook/tweeter kind of stuff using the\np2 theme ... etc ... yet we also had a number of dynamic realtime\necommerce applications on the site in a cgi scripting language that\nran their prayer line and buy a candle apps ... originally the prayer\nline was in the \"prayers\" sub folder which was how we designed the\nsite 10 years ago before we moved over to WP multisite ... never\noccured to us there might be a trip up as the cgi scripts were not php\nnor htaccess sensitive (ie., built using html/os) ... but as you might\nimagine, \"prayers\" is a pretty popular term for said client\nstakeholders so we quickly learned that our prayer line and other\ndynamic apps ceased to work - or better stated, ceased to co-exist and\nplay nice with WP ...\nthe work around was to create a directory we knew would never be a\nterm, category, or page ... in this case we used my company's name\n\"avanti\" as that sub directory and then built all other applications\noff that sub directory and voila worked (avanti all shows at top of\nfolder list so it made development easier without having to constantly\nscroll down a long list of folders) ... so while the dynamic url was\nnot pretty - e.g., domain.com/cgi-bin/script/avanti/prayers/ .. the WP\nurl was - e.g., domain.com/prayers/ ... and then once on that WP page\nthey could click into the dynamic app to request a prayer, view\nprayers, as well as staff login to review pending prayers to\nedit-delete-approve etc...\nthus hope this helps as it certainly cost me about a week of time to\nfigure out, debug and then another week or two to re-architect the\nsite's information design and code - all of which i had to eat as\nunforseen development cost that we could not pass along to the client\nbut i digress ... cordially, chuck scott\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChuck Scott -\u003e Information Architect\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpecialty -\u003e WordPress Multisite Information Design\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSite -\u003e http://ChuckingIt.com - Reflecting on Life,\nBusiness, Entrepreneurship, Innovation \u0026 Technology\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat's New -\u003e Tweeting a bit at @avantigroup\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "body": "Scott)\nHi - i just wanted to jump into this thread a bit given the outlaw \nsuggestions of starting outside the IT/political boxes ...\nwhile reading some of the comments i was reminded about conversation \ni had in mid 90s with IBM's John Patrick ... at the time he was part \nof big blue's top brass, famed internally for thinkbook innovation, \nfamed outside with his global speaking about all things web (e.g., he \nwent on to author book called Net Attitude) plus sundry other \naccomplishments but his story about AlphaWorks project was what i \nwanted to share here ...\nif memory serves correct, at the time John was frustrated with the \ninternal silos (e.g., the AS400 people did not talk to the Lotus \npeople, etc) and as a culture they were super brainy but marketing \nkerplunk* ... so in an effort to jump start relations with outside \ndevelopers, programmers and emerging web development community, he \nwent outside his organization, bought a domain, set up a site, and \ngrained massive traction ... then at some point, the powers that were \nwoke up, bought his domain and rolled that \"skunks work project\" back \ninto their main core as outreach effort to get products from lab to \nmarkets but i digress ...\nhe and i enjoyed many strategy discussions along the way as we worked \non a couple other projects but he also shared two things that might \nbe relevant to this thread -\u003e\na) last to change ... one of the things i first heard from a mentor \nin 1992 and then echoed again by John later was that the last three \norganizations that will be totally transformed by web technologies \nwill be Wall Street, Education, and Government - in that order ... i \nthink history is pretty much showing this to be correct ... with \nPaypal, online trading and now bitcoin technology, the finance impact \nis pretty clear ... with the rising cost of traditional education and \nit's dubious advantage in a \"just-in-time learning\" globalized world, \nit is only a matter of time before lynda.com's and others put a real \ndent into education markets but to be continued in this education \nchanging dept via web but my bet = WordPress will have HUGE part ... \nand with respect to gov'ts, well, Arab Spring from social media is \nonly a beginning but here to we see WP playing huge role in more and \nmore gov't agencies ...\nb) plan-build-deploy vs sense-and-respond ... apparently this was a \nbig part of John's message to those would listen to him in that the \nold days, the plan-build-deploy worked great but not so much today \ngiven the massive changes from some many levels ... he would laugh \nwhen he said \"Chuck, by the time we implement a given set of plans, \ntwo years would go by and the world was different then when we \nstarted out so much better to approach new markets via \nsense-and-respond method, then if it starts to take off, well then, \nlock and load and make it industrial...\"\nanyhow just sharing as fyi for those free thinkers and doers out here \non this list ... accordingly, i echo much of the sentiment in recent \nthread - just do it :\u003e)\ncordially, chuck scott\n*once i enjoyed the opportunity to sit in on a high-level meeting at \nWatson research whereby it was the first time the Lotus team (they \nhad just been acquired) was meeting with key web / media team to set \nthe global strategy for IBM .. there were like 27 people at the table \nand 25 of them had doctorates ... i was the only outsider and part of \nthe reason i was invited in was because they were trying to get \nbetter with the marketing and outreach to developers ... yet i share \nthis because there was one part of conversation about streaming media \nservers and competitors and first to market ... during that thread we \ntalked about how hot mail was just picked up for mega-millions with \nless than 2 years under their belt and scant revenues ... so while i \nwas promoting the merits of first to market moves, one of them said \nto me, \"Ah, gee Chuck - none of that really matters to us. Do you \nknow how much cash we have on our balance sheet? Any market we miss, \nwe can just buy our way in\" to which i thought about it for a moment \nand replied, \"Understood. They certainly didn't teach us that one in \nbusiness school but given your cash i can see your point.\"\n- fin -\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nMe -\u003e http://chuckscott.com\nChuck Scott - Creative Consultant\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Blog --\u003e http://chuckingit.com\nChucking It - Reflecting on Life, Business,\nEntrepreneurship, Innovation \u0026 Technology\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Company ---\u003e http://avantigroup.com\nThe Avanti Group, Inc. - Architects of\nMultimedia \u0026 Web Solutions\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat's New ---\u003e\nTweeting a bit at @avantigroup\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------",

You will have to create a template, however, that corresponds\nto this query. The plugin provides ample documentation on how to do this.\nThe description above is intended for creating a set of posts that are\ndistinct from the stock post type your get out of the WordPress box. If\nyou are looking to simply add custom fields to the existing post system,\nthis plugin would help establish the custom fields, but it might be\noverkill.\nPlease remember, too, that custom fields will not appear in your dropdown\nmenus as available until at least one post has been published that uses\nthat custom field (kinda like the way Categories don't appear in menus\nunless there's a post in one).\n- Steve\n-- \nSteve Covello\nRich Media Specialist/Online Instructor\nGranite State College\n603-513-1346\nSkype: steve.granitestate\nScheduling: http://meetme.so/stevecovello\n \nOn 4/26/13 11:53 AM, \"Grogan, David\" \u003cDavid.Grogan at tufts.edu\u003e wrote:\n\u003eHello all,\n\u003e\n\u003eI have not delved to deeply into the use of the custom field\n\u003efunctionality of WordPress but I'm looking at a use case that will do the\n\u003efollowing:\n\u003e\n\u003e1.

        "body": "Chris,\nIt's kind of what I do for a living :)\nActually, I work at the University of Mary Washington as an\ninstructional technologist, and we have been experimenting with\nWordPress as both a blogging solution,a s well as a loose CMS,\neportfolio system, quick and easy professional sites, domain mapped\nomnibus, etc. In short, we have been all over this application, we\nfinally went to a wpmu install almost two years ago after the demand\nwas too big and the upgrades and plugin management were too unwieldy\n(you can see it here: http://umwblogs.org).\nI think the point that WordPress is free isn't exactly true, all\nsoftware (whether open source or proprietary) somes a t a cost. And\nwhile the application is free, time, energy and development goes into\nactually creating something worthwhile and dynamic--just so happens is\nthat WP is one of the most flexible options because it is open and the\ncommunity is so strong (without that it would be just another blogging\napp).  I get paid to help faculty and students re-imagine publishing\nfor their academic pursuits, and WordPress fits the needs of our\ncommunity nicely, many professors and students are familiar with it,\nand the tech stuff is easy enough that a technical half-wit like\nmyself can make it work fairly well.\nAll this to say, the advocacy for WordPress comes from the people who\nare using it. And arguments against free software being necessarily\nproblematic because ti is free, is as flawed as arguing it is\nnecessarily better than one you might pay for. I find I sold people on\nit with examples from what others are doing, find and talk with people\nwho are using it at their organizations or schools, and ask them why\nthey use it, how they have adopted it, and what the user experience is\nlike.  Also, who maintains it, and what is the real cost behind\nmanaging it.  Do they have people who help folks with it?  How much\ndoes training cost?  Do they have PHP developers on staff? Etc.\nWordPress is good, and I agree it can make one hell of a CMS, but it\ndoes require some hacking and minimal PHP knowledge to make it work,\nthat said the educational community in WordPress is getting\nincreasingly stronger.\nI've spent a good three years blogging about educational uses of\nWordpress (http://bavatuesdays.com/tag/wpmued), and I am relatively\nlate to the game. James Farmer has been doing it for far longer than\nthat, as have D'Arcy norman and many other. So, here are some examples\nif you want to argue the ridiculous point that just because it is\ncheaper and more flexible it has to be faulty check out the Ten ways\nto use UMW Blogs:\nhttp://umwblogs.org/support/ten-ways-to-use-umw-blogs/\nCheck out  D'Arcy Norman's UCalgary Blogs (ucalgaryblogs.org), or\nEDUBLOGS (edublogs.org) which is a full-fledged business running\nnearly 200,000 blogs on this \"free\" software.  It is solid, and it's\nopenness has afforded it an insane community that ensures it's\npredominance, you can;t pay people to be passionate about something,\nit just happens, and what follows is often both exciting and valuable.\nther eare many, many more examples, and I'm sure others on this list\nwill pile them on readily.\nGood luck selling,\nJim\nOn Wed, Nov 5, 2008 at 11:02 PM, Chris Hajer \u003cchrishajer@gmail.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e Can anyone point to any advocacy resources online that support using\n\u003e WordPress in education?

    "body": "Hey All,\nI am hoping to garner some ideas from what other Universities are doing for the sign-up process for new users on their wordpress instances.\nIn the past we have been using the Shibboleth plugin to authenticate new users: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shibboleth/\nSignups are disabled on the site.  All users have to use the campus ID to log in the first time.  Since they use shibboleth there is no need for a signup.  After they log in the first time then can go to the signup page (new sites are allowed for existing users).\nWell, for us apparently 3.2 has broken the plugin, at least on our instance.  I have contacted the developers but not sure if/when they are going to update.\nWhen they authenticate and go back to the site it just goes blank.  I have tried troubleshooting.  Current users can still log in.  But new users go to a blank screen.  Debugging gives this error: Catchable fatal error: Object of class WP_Error could not be converted to string in /home/html/web-dev.unc.edu/html/wp-includes/formatting.php on line 2829\nI have googled and tried lots of solutions, but nothing is working so far, so I am looking to see if anyone out there has any ideas on a fix (or an updated shibboleth plugin they are using) or other workflow ideas?  I am also just curious what others are using for signing up new users on their campus.\nThanks for any advice, tips you can offer.\n~Jeff VanDrimmelen\nUNC-CH\nhttp://web.unc.edu Admin\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-edu/attachments/20110720/b33be7d8/attachment.htm\u003e",
