Subject: [HyperDB] New HyperDB page on WordPress Codex
Message-ID: <46DDE0DE.6030308@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I added a page on the codex covering HyperDB linking to SVN and this list.
http://codex.wordpress.org/HyperDB

It's a pretty sparse introduction taken primarily from Barry / Matt's 
presentation[1][2]. If anyone on the list would like to add any info, 
please do so.

Also, in the spirit of list introductions (which I missed having not 
joined back in May!), here's me:

Name: Callum Macdonald
20 Words: Fairly long standing WordPress user, recently plugin coder and 
wordpress server admin
Interest in HyperDB: Working on a couple of high traffic sites and 
looking at ways to scale them cost effectively. Also generally 
interested in application scaling.

Cheers - Callum.
