Subject: [HyperDB] Active Master and Passive Master with binary replication
Message-ID: <2075C1F7A791BE438A3A1098B4EF48D413A1940DB3@BATWEXMVCG01.uk.futurenet.com>

Hi,

We've been testing out HyperDB for a few weeks now trying to get it work in a particular way.

We wish to have an Active Master (db1) which handles Reads + Writes. We have a Passive Master (db2) that does Read only and keeps up-to-date with binary replication from the Active Master (db1).

As soon as we disable the Active Master (db1) HyperDB spits out errors like "No databases available with wp_4_options (global)".

We've spilt an existing MU database and migrated it to another MU server while using HyperDB for failover.
We are using the latest version of HyperDB.

Our current config, db-config.php (values replaced for security):
// MASTER DATABASE
$wpdb->add_database(array(
            'host'     => 'db1.mysql-server.com',     // If port is other than 3306, use host:port.
            'user'     => 'user',
            'password' => 'password',
            'name'     => 'database',
            'write'    => 1,
            'read'     => 1,
            'dataset'  => 'global',
            'timeout'  => 0.2,
    'charset'  => 'utf8',
    'collate'  => '',
));
// SLAVE DATABASE
$wpdb->add_database(array(
            'host'     => 'db2.mysql-server.com',     // If port is other than 3306, use host:port.
            'user'     => 'user',
            'password' => 'password',
            'name'     => 'database',
            'write'    => 0,
            'read'     => 1,
            'dataset'  => 'global',
            'timeout'  => 0.2,
    'charset'  => 'utf8',
    'collate'  => '',
));

Is there any advice/help that you can give us?

Many thanks,
Jason Ashdown

This is the code that spits out that error:

if ( empty($this->hyper_servers[$dataset][$operation]) )
  return $this->bail("No databases available with $this->table ($dataset)");

$operation is either "read" or "write". If you disable db1 in your
config (I'm guessing this is what you did), you are left with db2
which is configured for read only, not for write. If db2 is supposed
to receive reads when db1 is disabled, your config must reflect that.

You might try configuring db2 with 'write' => 2. In case your
configuration needs to change dynamically when the db status changes,
you can make your configuration dynamic. One way is to have multiple
configurations in conditional blocks.

I have not tested HyperDB with DRBD or any other multi-master setup.
However, I did intend for HyperDB to provide the same sort of failover
for writes that it does for reads. I'll be curious to see how you make
it work.

Cheers,
Andy

Jason, Andy,

Just to toss in my 2 cents,  I currently use HyperDB in nearly this same
scenario with with a multi-master setup and it is working beautifully.

My setup contains a similar configuration as to Andy's prev suggestion
of making db2 contain 'write'=>2  so it is seen basically as a fail-over
for db1.


Thanks,
Nick

Thanks guys.

We shall test out 'write'=>2 for our second Passive Master in our config.

It's not exactly what we are looking for but it's a step in the right direction. If need be, I can write conditional statements just like Andy recommends.

Thanks again,
Jason
