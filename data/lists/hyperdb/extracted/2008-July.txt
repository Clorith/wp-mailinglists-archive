Subject: [HyperDB] HyperDB Latest WPMU Trunk
Message-ID: <1478c5740807051646w7ea3bfe5i7b81ad6df25ee1c9@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone!   I am happy to finally have signed up for this list and
report back on what I have found out.    With the recent update from
Andy in the SVN (thanks for that), I have HyperDB working with
multiple datacenters and multiple server replication on the latest
version of TRAC for WPMU (rev 1353).    I know Andy mentioned he
hadn't tested out the advanced features, but everything is working
alright for me.    I thank everyone for their work on this and
extremely happy to hear that you will be updating it against the WP
trunk now as most people here are early adapters and testers anyways
:)   I tested it quickly on the latest 2.6 beta 3 code and it worked
as well, but I am sure that doesn't surprise people :)

Thanks,

Trent

Does it make sense now to start tagging the hyperdb for different
versions of WP and WPMU?

This way, people can find the right HyperDB version for their WP
installation easily, while developers use the trunk for the latest
trac version.

I would imagine since the WPMU Trac replicates the changes of the
normal WP Trunk it shouldn't matter.   It really only involved the one
small extra change to wp-config.php which really isn't a problem.

I was mostly concerned about the difference between WP versions, not
WP and WPMU differences.

Many WPMU installations are not upgraded to the latest version yet,
and it would be nice to have a tagged version of HyperDB for WPMU
1.3.3 and 1.5.1, while having the trunk of HyperDB always tracking the
latest Trac version. What do you guys think?
