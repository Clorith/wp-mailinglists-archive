Subject: [HyperDB] init_charset() bug for < 3.0
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=cerTbLxrKLiG-8MN0XQP1HAWPt9ouP5JYMRKP@mail.gmail.com>

Grabbed the latest version of HyperDB, plopped it into a dev install of
2.9.2 and promptly got an error. :)  Here's the fix:

/**
 * Sets $this->charset and $this->collate
 */
function init_charset() {
if ( *function_exists('is_multisite') &&* is_multisite() ) {
$this->charset = 'utf8';
if ( defined( 'DB_COLLATE' ) && DB_COLLATE )
$this->collate = DB_COLLATE;
else
$this->collate = 'utf8_general_ci';
} elseif ( defined( 'DB_COLLATE' ) ) {
$this->collate = DB_COLLATE;
}

if ( defined( 'DB_CHARSET' ) )
$this->charset = DB_CHARSET;
}

Hope that helps!

Subject: [HyperDB] Any advantage to partitioning on a single database server?
Message-ID: <AANLkTimwAO3iOPAZXZ_EghuGw_w7h2rREfoTR8Y9AOM0@mail.gmail.com>

I've been doing more research into scaling a WordPress multi-site
installation, and I've been under the assumption that partitioning the
tables into multiple databases would be beneficial for a large installation
(hypothetically 50,000 blogs).

But then I came across this quote from the HyperDB
FAQ<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyperdb/faq/>
:
Is there any advantage to using HyperDB with just one database server?
None that has been measured.


Does that still apply even if partitioning is used?

I know that using multiple database server would definitely bring a
performance enhancement, but we're starting with one... so is it even worth
it to implement partitioning at all right now?

Thanks!

At some point we decided to have multiple databases on a single
machine. Maybe it had something to do with the number of files in a
directory, or the number of hard drives in the machine; I never quite
understood it. Maybe Barry or Donncha can explain.

There is some measurable overhead to partitioning. So if you had two
blogs and you put them in separate partitions I assume there would be
a tiny downside and no measurable upside.

At some point (hopefully) you'll need to use partitioning due to
hardware limitations. When that time comes, you may or may not benefit
from any partitioning you did on the one first server. Your scheme
might have to be thrown out or it might actually make it easier to
migrate to a scaled-up system. The only guaranteed benefit is having
the experience of working with the more complex configuration.

Without further information I'd say proceed without partitioning.
Don't try to do all your scaling in advance; it doesn't work. Run some
experiments once you have real-world data and traffic.

The number of files in a directory is exactly the reason I was thinking that
partitioning would be needed.  We're using MyISAM so that would be 3 files
per table, and if there are 50,000 blogs with 9 tables per blog that would
be 1,350,000 files in a single directory.

I'm no database or filesystem expert, but wouldn't that large number of
files be an issue?  Unfortunately it isn't easy way to "test" different
configurations before actually growing to that size, but we're looking to
set things up ahead of time to be prepared.

Thanks!

Hola Jim,

Yes, I believe it is beneficial to partition into multiple databases on
a single server. I had a little experience with MultiDB from Incsub and
that was the primary reason behind partitioning on a single server. I
believe that edublogs.org uses 4096 databases on a single server, in
production. They might have changed their configuration in the last year
or two, but that was how it went a while back.

I don't remember if it was because of the number of files per directory
or the number of simultaneously open files, but I know we partitioned
the data (for about 300k blogs at that point) across multiple databases
on a single database server.

Best of luck with your project.

Love and joy - Callum.
