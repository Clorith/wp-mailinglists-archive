Subject: [HyperDB] dbDeltas with HyperDB
Message-ID: <CAFzJe3Y_DvM-RpTdsW7JNXnP4kNTfN-mRu7wyry1Oxt6S8fpoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

I'm having an issue with HyperDB and the dbDelta function.  dbDelta runs the
following code:

$tables = $wpdb->get_col('SHOW TABLES;')

And then loops through the results.  Well, this can be a real issue with
sharding, where each table can be located on a different database server.
 It seems to me that the only way to solve this problem would be to patch
Wordpress core (have dbDelta check each table's existence individually) and
also patch HyperDB to properly parse the table name from the individual SHOW
TABLES query.  There's an existing core
ticket<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17998>that begins to
address a similar issue, but it won't work with HyperDB.

Right now I'm just trying to figure out how to approach the issue.  It seems
like it would affect just about any plugin that uses dbDelta to upgrade
their database tables.  Has anyone else run into this problem?  Any good
solutions?

Thanks!

Why does dbDelta bother with SHOW TABLES at all? Why not just loop
over the table names and do DESCRIBE TABLE on each one?

foreach ( $cqueries as $table => $qry ) {
    $tablefields = $wpdb->get_results( "DESCRIBE $table" );
    if ( $tablefields ) {
        // Generate ALTER TABLE statements
    } else {
        // Use CREATE TABLE statement
    }
}

Really good point.  dbDelta could drop the SHOW TABLES and the loop through
those tables and perform exactly the same?

I submitted a bug report:
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19007

If anyone has a chance to double-check my code, that'd be great.  I'll try
to give it some testing next week.
