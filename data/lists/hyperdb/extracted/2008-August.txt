Hello,
 
We're trying to set up master / slave replication using HyperDB where
the reads should go to the slave and writes to the master.
 
Here it fails. Since HyperDB does a SET NAMES UTF-8 query in the
constructor, it connects to the master, which means all following
queries are sent to the master too.
 
We use the following settings in db-settings.php:
 
add_db_server('global', 0, '', 0, true, '192.168.210.4:3306',
'192.168.210.4:3306', 'xx', 'xxx', 'xxx'); // master
add_db_server('global', 0, '', 1, false, '192.168.210.7:3306',
'192.168.210.7:3306', 'xx', 'xxx', 'xxx'); // slave
 
Does anyone have experience with this kind of set up?
 
If I comment the SET NAMES query it works fine.
 
Thanks in advance,

SET NAMES is now in db_connect. Update HyperDB to the latest version.
Check the installation instructions for changes since your version was
installed.

Cheers,
Andy

Hi Andy,

Thanks for your reply.

We're now using the latest version of HyperDB with WordPress 2.2. That
works fine.

However, the current implementation does a mysql_select_db / Init DB for
each query @ r. 455-456.

If we strip these checks from the if statement, everything still works
as expected.
 
Is there any reason to keep this in the code?

Thanks in advance,

	Wouter Westendorp

That logic was added because PHP reuses connections defined by
host+user+pass. If you have more than one database on a host, when you
reuse the connection without selecting the database you risk using the
wrong database (fixed in line 455). I also seem to remember times when
the connection was available to be reused but the database had become
unselected due to a timeout (456).

I know that these are not typical cases but they caused problems on
WordPress.com. Have you found the mysql_select_db statements to be a
big performance hit? How big?
