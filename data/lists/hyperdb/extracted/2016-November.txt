Wow... I haven't seen a message come across this message board for a 
long time. I had to re-configure my mail client so that I could reply!

HyperDB will do what you want.  You must configure MySQL to handle the 
replication, but HyperDB will allow your WordPress install to access 
multiple databases.

Here are to relatively recent tutorials to guide you through this process:
1. 
https://torbjornzetterlund.com/how-to-setup-a-mysql-replication-database-for-wordpress/
2. 
http://net-load.com/how-to-setup-mysql-database-master-and-slave-with-hyperdb-on-wordpress/

Both of those articles, at a glance, seem to be fairly accurate and they 
should do what you need.

Here are some of my own tips for you:
1. Only do this when it is proven that you need to do this. Don't 
complicate your set up if you don't absolutely have proof that you have to.
2. Before you switch to HyperDB, make certain that you have eliminated 
any extra DB writes in your code. If you are writing to the database 
when you don't need to be, eliminating that may solve all of your 
database headaches.
3. Make certain that once replication is configured, that all of your 
slave database are receiving changes in a timely fashion.  One of the 
worst things to debug is why some visitors to your site get one set of 
data and others get another.
4. If you also have multiple webheads, use a caching solution for page 
caching and micro-caching that is accessible to all of your servers.  
Allow the work on one server to be a benefit of all of your servers.
5. Also if you have multiple webheads, beware of the use of state 
conditions like sessions and transients that if not implemented 
correctly could exist on one server, but not be carried over to others.

That's my advice of the morning.  Hope that helps!

Thank you for your replay... I don't have much knowledge about replication...
I have to learn it then i can apply...  I am a student... I am still
learning about wordpress... I am opening a website where we will open blog
for my friends and classmate... we will have lot of blogs so I need to
separate them in multiple database.. i will create the database manually..
suppose i'll store 300 blogs for each database... my current database will
keep getting new registration when it reach 300 blogs will move them in new
database... when my current database get another 300 blogs ill move them
another database... can i add one by one..? i mean when I need will add
them and configure theme in db-config.php do you have any tutorial about it
or any code suggestion..? can you suggest me how can i write the callback
function that will determine which blog is in which database...!! Thanks

The number 1 rule of scalability is...

don't fix problems you don't have

My advice would be to run your blog system on a single database, and
deal with separating it into multiple databases only if and when you
actually have a performance problem. You might find that many other
things are bigger issues along the way first.

Cheers - Callum.
