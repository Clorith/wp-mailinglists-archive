Subject: [HyperDB] Two Database Configuration
Message-ID: <20100724202607.12566u9e691nepc8@www.landofshadow.net>

I seem to have gotten things connected to allow the site to 'work'.   
However, I'm trying to use the HyperDB functionality to connect to a  
second database on the same server with the intent of pulling data for  
a plug-in from it.

$wpdb->add_database(array(
         'host'     => 'localhost',
         'user'     => 'username',
         'password' => 'password',
         'name'     => 'wp_database',
));
$wpdb->add_database(array(
         'host'     => 'localhost',
         'user'     => 'username',
         'password' => 'password',
         'name'     => 'plugin_database',
         'dataset'  => 'plugin_dataset',
));

Whenever I try to do:

$myrows = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM account" );

Account is a table in the plugin_database.  I get the following error:

Fatal error: Call to a member function get_results() on a non-object  
in  
/srv/web/www.landofshadow.net/public_html/wp-content/plugins/eden/eden.php on  
line 15

Any tips as to how I actually configure or utilize this correctly?   
Assistance with this would be "greatly" appreciated.

My guess: you forgot "global $wpdb;".

Cheers,

Subject: [HyperDB] is_write_query too strict
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=DWgzSMdKsfXMFU0ds1c6_5yGGVfDpFAACMVVj@mail.gmail.com>

Came across an issue where only the first query (autoload options) was being
sent to the read slave(s). Turns out a couple plugins had the syntax 'SHOW
TABLES LIKE...' which HyperDB thought was a read query, since it didn't
match 'SELECT' as the first word. Made a quick fix for what I think are some
common read statements to db.php:

function is_write_query( $q ) {
		$pattern = '/^\s*(SELECT|SHOW|DESCRIBE|EXPLAIN)\s+/i';
		return (preg_match($pattern, $q)) ? false : true;
	}

As you can see my regex-fu is weak, I spent a good 40 minutes trying to
negatively match those words. Gave up, instead positively match them and
then return true if there's *not* a match.
