Subject: [HyperDB] multi-datacenter configuration
Message-ID: <C82C0E2E.19E00%Joe_Beck@Comcast.com>

We?re looking to migrate to a multi-datacenter configuration & the 2 most
obvious challenges with wordpress are DB and wp-contents contents.
This post is focused on DB:
Can anyone speak to architecture options here.
I?ve read that wordpress.com has 3 data centers but I believe its only using
master ? slave replication.
if this is the case, are you just using mysql replication to keep all dbs
across data centers in sync?
And more specifically, how do you direct any writes (article posts or
comments submitted) to the master db to do the write?
this goes back to orig question on whether you only have a single master
that resides in 1 of your data centers.

I realize that hyperDB has some capabilities to support multi-DC but I
needed to get the above question answered before even looking closer at
that, at least I think I do.

Thanks for any feedback,
Joe

That's right.

In the HyperDB config you specify the masters by setting their "write"
flag. See db-settings.php for details.

thanks.
does this mean there is a single point of failure then?
if the data center with the master (write) db is inaccessible/down/whatever
or that db server is down/offline/whatever then no writes can happen?

Yes.

We do not use multi-master anywhere in our system, so I don't know
from experience, but I think if you use that you will be able to
configure HyperDB to work with it.

Subject: [HyperDB] 1.0 soon
Message-ID: <AANLkTimjasZPDlx7HJvytU0RLcCXuW5aGrRE2Ltad7Em@mail.gmail.com>

I have tagged current trunk as 0.1. Trunk will be changing very
rapidly beginning now. These are the goals:
* Remove BackPress support
* Remove WPMU support in favor of WP 3.0
* Remove globals like $db_servers, $db_tables
* Remove $single_db (just use wpdb if no multiple DBs)
* class hyperdb extends wpdb (much easier to maintain)
* Move config function logic to hyperdb class
  - leave back-compat wrappers in config file for lazy upgrade
  - you can modify the wrappers
* Instantiate with DB constants before loading config
  - you can query that DB to determine how to configure hyperdb!
  - it's okay if you don't have those constants or they are empty
  - if you don't query, it won't connect. no performance hit.
* Remove get_ds_part_from_table
* Remove $hash
* Replace the two above with a plug-in system
  - you can define and register your own function in your config
  - function arg will be the query. it can use get_table_from_query.
  - function will return compact('dataset', 'partition', 'database')
  - db_connect will extract (overwrite) so it's quite powerful
  - no function registered, no performance hit
* Merge some custom wordpress.com db features into hyperdb 1.0
* Simplify installation procedure, make it atomic (safer)
  - Deploying only db.php has no effect (it falls back on wpdb)
  - Deploying db-config.php turns on hyperdb

The next few changesets will break WPMU and fix 3.0.

If you are using WPMU and not planning on migrating to WP 3.0 you will
be maintaining your own branch of hyperdb.

When you upgrade to 1.0 you will be REQUIRED to update your
configuration. The upgrade will most likely be copy/paste and
search/replace, two minutes with a text editor. I'm changing the
config file name to force you to take action.

Using a new config file name also makes the upgrade safer. You can
deploy the new config then deploy the new db.php for an atomic
upgrade. Naturally you should test before deploying to a production
site.

If you are using any of the things I plan to remove please reply. I
will try to make it easy for everyone to upgrade.

To discuss any planned new features or requests please start a new subject.

Cheers,
Andy

I guess at that point (master db down) db-settings.php would be updated to
point all writes to the slave.

If anyone who is doing multi-datacenter with hyperdb can offer feedback in
terms of architecture & configuration that would be helpful.
In terms of writes...
if mysql is config?d in master slave config or master-master but all write
traffic is routed to single master via hyperdb, I?m concerned about latency?
if my config is:
akamai in front, caching many reads & doing GTM (global traffic mgr) to
origin (my blog web servers) for the rest of the traffic
datacenter(DC) east: 3 web nodes & 3 db nodes
datacenter(DC) west: 3 web nodes & 3 db nodes

the latency I expect to occur is if my primary write db is in DC east and
write traffic that flows through DC west will look at hyperdb config & send
all write traffic to my primary db in DC east...this may be an issue
depending on pipe/bandwidth, traffic volume, and load.

Is this the config that some of you using, or similar type of setup?
And, has anyone tested and addressed this latency concern?

thanks for any feedback,
Joe

Does anyone know if the SharDB plugin works with the new HyperDB 1.0
release, or does it need also need an update?
