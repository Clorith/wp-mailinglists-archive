Hi Guys,

I'm just forwarding this on. We've been working on HyperDB and came 
across a lil bug... and here is the fixed file. Our comments are 
there... you can't miss it :)

Ciao,

Dan

I added ". '|ALTER TABLE(?:\s+ADD)?'  " to the Big pattern in 
get_table_from_query to make sure it can get the table name out of SQL 
queries like the following:

ALTER TABLE `wp_22_purchase_logs` ADD `find_us` varchar(255) NOT NULL

Actually it looks like the patched file may not have attached itself 
correctly. Just incase you can download the patched file from here:

Hi Dan,

That's definitely a bug, but not the best patch. Here is the MySQL
manual on ALTER TABLE syntax:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/alter-table.html

The keyword "ADD" only appears after the table name, so it's not
needed. However, "IGNORE" is legal between ALTER and TABLE. I applied
the following patch to fix the "ALTER" pattern:

http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/71913

Please pass that on and let me know if it's not a good fix.

Cheers,
Andy

hello~~!

before send mail my english is very fool

please understand that.

I download HyperDb.

And I read readme.txt.

1. *WordPress MU only:* add this line near the top of `wp-config.php`:

`define('WPMU', true);`

2. Upload `db.php` to the `/wp-content/` directory. At this point, HyperDB
is active.
  It will use the database connection constants until you complete the final
steps.

3. Upload `db-settings.php` in the directory that holds `wp-config.php`

4. Edit the db settings according to the directions in that file.

5. Add this line near the top of `wp-config.php`:

`require('db-settings.php');`


But I don't know number 4( 4. Edit the db settings according to the
directions in that file.)

pleaze let me explain

thank you

What specific things don't you understand?

Have you got WordPress working _without_ HyperDB before, or are you
completely new to setting up WordPress?

I found this further in the file:

        // Database servers grouped by dataset. (Totally tabular, dude!)
        // R can be 0 (no reads) or a positive integer indicating the order
        // in which to attempt communication (all locals, then all remotes)
        
        //dataset, partition, datacenter, R, W,             internet host:port,     internal network host:port,   database,        user,        password
        
        // Next line populates 'global' dataset from wp-config.php for instant compatibility. Remove it when you put your settings here.
        add_db_server('global', 0,    '', 1, 1,                        DB_HOST,                        DB_HOST,    DB_NAME,     DB_USER,     DB_PASSWORD);
        
        /*
        add_db_server(  'misc', 0, 'lax', 1, 1,     'misc.db.example.com:3722',     'misc.db.example.lan:3722',  'wp-misc',  'miscuser',  'miscpassword');
        add_db_server('global', 0, 'nyc', 1, 1,'global.mysql.example.com:3509','global.mysql.example.lan:3509','global-db','globaluser','globalpassword');
        */

So it looks like you have to add some add_db_server() lines of your own.
These lines should reflect your MySQL server details, which you should
already know if you are setting up HyperDB.

If this is still too complicated, I do not recommend running HyperDB at
all. You have already said that you have got WordPress working without
HyperDB. Unless you have more than, say, 100 pageviews per second, I see
no reason for you to use HyperDB, especially if WordPress is already
working well for you.

2.7?

I've only seen a few small updates to wpdb in 2.7. They will be merged
into hyperdb but it should still work pretty well as-is. Please let us
know if you find problems.

If you add the function has_cap from wpdb.php below the
support_collation function in db.php it works fine.

Merged: http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/76172

Please test before deploying to a production environment. Let us know
how it goes.
