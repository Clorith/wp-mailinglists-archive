Subject: [HyperDB] Is hyperdb depreciated?
Message-ID: <F3318834F1F89D46857972DD4B411D7001A1358847@exchange>

Hi,

I am trying to find out if hyperdb is depreciated or if it is just not being maintained.

When I use hyperdb in my implementation there are a ton of warnings/errors being posted to my apache log.

Below are some examples:

These seem to appear pretty much constantly.

Howdy,

Thanks for the note.  This is on our list to fix.  Expect to see those fixes and some other, cool updates for HyperDB coming soon.

Subject: [HyperDB] Multiple Database Setup and Read
Message-ID: <AB6C69C6-2FB6-4B65-A51E-F5A424F6D331@goteama.com>

Hi there,

I have some clients that have a main Wordpress install and now are  
hoping to add two mini-sites that draw specific posts from the main  
site. My hope was to set up two separate Wordpress installs and use  
HyperDB to allow me to pull from the main database as needed.

I have add the databases as follows:

<code>
$wpdb->add_database(array(
	'host'     => 'mysql.german.site',     // If port is other than 3306,  
use host:port.
	'user'     => 'username',
	'password' => 'password',
	'name'     => 'german_db',
	'dataset'  => 'global'
));

$wpdb->add_database(array(
	'host'     => 'mysql.site',     // If port is other than 3306, use  
host:port.
	'user'     => 'username',
	'password' => 'password',
	'name'     => 'main_db',
	'write'    => 0,
	'read'     => 1,
	'dataset'  => 'main'
));
</code>

The first database is for the site that will highlight german content  
from the main site.

The second is the main database - I want to be able to only read from  
this site.

The two databases have different table prefixes (ge_ for german and  
wp_ for the main site)

I had hoped that this would work (as a test):

<code>
global $wpdb;
$wpdb->set_prefix(?wp_?);

$fivesdrafts = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT post_title FROM $wpdb->posts  
WHERE post_status = 'published'");

foreach ($fivesdrafts as $fivesdraft) {
	echo $fivesdraft->post_title;
}
</code>

But I get nothing on the page here. Any ideas? The final goal here is  
to pull in all published posts from a specific category and list them  
on this page.

Any help would be appreciated, let me know if I need to post more  
information.

Thanks,
Aris

Hola Aris,

I don't think HyperDB is the tool for the job you've described.

I think you'd be much simpler to put all the data into one database,
using 2 table prefixes as you suggest, and then pull data through some
kind of plugin.

HyperDB is designed to allow WordPress to scale. Unless you're hosting
thousands of blogs, seeing massive traffic or have some other reason to
split databases over multiple servers, I don't think you need HyperDB.

I suggest you try the support forums for assistance on doing this
through a plugin.

Love & joy - Callum.

I'm having a heck of a time figuring out why MySQL process jumps to 700% on two different hosts every time people approve comments on this WP installation, driving me crazy.
