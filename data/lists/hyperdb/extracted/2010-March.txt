Message-ID: <C7B0C007.11D14%Joe_Beck@Comcast.com>

I?m new to hyperdb & need some help getting a dev env configured for a POC.
we have mysql in a master-slave config and would like to leverage hyperdb
for 2 things--> split reads/writes and support multiple data center.

For now, the focus is on splitting the reads & writes.
after going thru the install steps it seemed like a pretty simple process,
but I?m getting hung up on the add_db_server line in db-settings.php
originally I had:

add_db_server('global', 0, '', 0,
0,'172.18.0.52:3306','172.18.0.52:3306','blogs_sprint','blogs_sprint','blogs
_sprint');  //wp1 as read svr
add_db_server('global', 0, '', 1,
0,'172.18.0.55:3306','172.18.0.55:3306','blogs_sprint','blogs_sprint','blogs
_sprint');  //wp2 as write svr

but was getting the following error:
Unable to connect to : while querying table 'wp_1_options' (global_w)

then I was questioning the horizontal partitioning part of this.
so I commented out the first add_db_server line but still getting the same.
then, I started going thru the code & tried changing my add_db_server line
to
add_db_server('global_w', 0, '', 1,
0,'172.18.0.55:3306','172.18.0.55:3306','blogs_sprint','blogs_sprint','blogs
_sprint');  //wp2

I stopped getting the orig error but got the std can?t find your blog msg:
No WPMU site defined on this host. If you are the owner of this site, please
check <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_WPMU'>Debugging WPMU</a>
for further assistance.

Any suggestions or guidance on this is greatly appreciated.
we?re using wpmu 2.8.6 & I downloaded the latest hyperdb, don?t see a
version on this.

thanks,
Joe

Your config is telling HyperDB that there is no place to send reads. Try a 1
in the R arg of the read server.

thanks, I?ll give that a shot later this am.
based on the comments in that doc, I thought that column was a weighted
value, making 0 the most preferred db node for reading. looks like it was
just this presumption I was making that got me mixed up here.

thanks. yes, this did it.
add_db_server('global', 0, '', 1,
0,'172.18.0.52:3306','172.18.0.52:3306','blogs_sprint','blogs_sprint','blogs

add_db_server('global', 0, '', 0,
1,'172.18.0.55:3306','172.18.0.55:3306','blogs_sprint','blogs_sprint','blogs
_sprint');  //wp2 write svr

I heard that hyperdb is good for logging/keeping track of queries & where
they?re being sent.
anyone have any details on that?
if I?m mistaken, can anyone recommend a way to validate & track reads &
writes to verify hyperdb is doing what you expect?

thanks,
Joe

Message-ID: <C7B14F2E.7A0DF%dan@digitaltrends.com>

Has anyone successfully integrated hyperdb and w3 total cache?

If you are not familiar with w3 total cache, it requires a db.php file in
the wp-content folder as well.  To get both to work, you would have to do
some integration work with W3 Total Cache.

Message-ID: <662701801003021205q74fb390by4f7fbad9b6bef595@mail.gmail.com>

i have this configuration:

add_db_server('global',0,'slave1',1,0,'192.168.136.141:3306','
192.168.136.141:3306',wordpress,user,user);
// Slave DB

add_db_server('global',0,'master1',2,1,'192.168.136.70:3306','
192.168.136.70:3306',wordpress,user,user);
// Master DB



-- enabled logging in mysql but some reason not select's are being thrown to
the "slave1" node.. all SQL are being executed on "master"

any ideas why? did i miss something?

This shouldn't happen unless:

1) The slave is not available (are you sure you are able to connect?)
2) There is a write query on the same page load as the read queries - if there is a write, HyperDB will send all subsequent reads on that page load to the master to try and alleviate possible data inconsistency caused by replication lag.

Any errors in your logs?

Hi all, i'm using hyperDB with WP MU and i'm trying to do a select in all
the partitions...
that is,
i want to make a "SELECT fields FROM table WHERE etc..." but i need the
results from all the partitions, is this possible ?
I set up the servers with add_db_server.

Thanks in advance

Sorry, hyperdb does not help you select across partitions. You must query
each partition yourself and then collate the results.

You might also be interested in the MySQL Federated storage engine.

Ok,
so there's a way to switch between different partitions ?
