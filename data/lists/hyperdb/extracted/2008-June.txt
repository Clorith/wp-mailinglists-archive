It should be version agnostic - could you be a bit more specific about 
what's 2.3-specific?

Subject: [HyperDB] setup help
Message-ID: <CEFDC945-6D33-40F4-8CE1-B4929BE4FC46@filtrbox.com>

Has there been any documentation written on how to setup HyperDB or  
troubleshoot issues? I'm trying to get it going but am not a php dev  
really.

I added the contents of db-settings.php to my wp-config.php and  
replaced wp-db.php in ~/wp-includes/ with the HyperDB db.php.

getting this:

Warning: array_key_exists() [function.array-key-exists]: The second  
argument should be either an array or an object in /usr/local/filtrbox/ 
apache2/htdocs/www/blog/wp-includes/wp-db.php on line 266

Warning: mysql_affected_rows(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL- 
Link resource in /usr/local/filtrbox/apache2/htdocs/www/blog/wp- 
includes/wp-db.php on line 429

Fatal error: Call to undefined method wpdb::set_prefix() in /usr/local/ 
filtrbox/apache2/htdocs/www/blog/wp-settings.php on line 211

All I'm trying to do is use HyperDB to get WP to work in a master- 
slave environment (both DB servers are local). I don't have multiple  
locations. My assumption is that the problem is with the database  
definition since we aren't not supposed to need to touch the db.php  
file? Here's my string. (I have replaced my real username and passwords)

add_db_server('global', 0, 'iad', 1, 0,  '10.101.242.23:3306',   
'10.101.242.23:3306', 'fbox_blog', 'dbusername',        'dbpassword');

any help would be great - this is time sensitive...

HyperDB is not compatible with your version of WordPress.

I haven't tried it, but you might be able to make it work by copying
the new vars and methods from WPDB into HyperDB.

Subject: [HyperDB] Questions regarding HyperDB
Message-ID: <982743.78270.qm@web45815.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

I have not taken a good look at HyperDB yet, so I have just a few quick questions regarding it. 
1) Would it be very difficult to implement HyperDB in a non-wordpress PHP application. Is it too tightly integrated into wordpress for a port?
2) What advantages does HyperDB have over a custom solution that divides the database into 4096 smaller databases?
3) Where can I find documentation regarding HyperDB?
Thanks guys.

Thanks Andy,
I had just upgraded that blog to 2.5.1. I can downgrade to 2.3.3 if  
you think that would work (that's what we still have in production).

Best,
Ari

What? HyperDB is not compatible with 2.5.1? How the heck does
WordPress.com run on it?

I guess it's not as open source as we thought it was.

I just updated HyperDB for compatibility with WordPress trunk at
revision 8094. No other compatibility is implied.

http://svn.wp-plugins.org/hyperdb/trunk/

db.php:
Put it in wp-content. It will function the same as core WPDB, using
the DB definitions in wp-config.php until you set up db-config.php.

db-settings.php:
Put it wherever wp-config.php lives and require it in wp-config.php
after the prefix is assigned. Follow the directions to replace the
default with your multi-db configuration.

Cheers,
Andy

Subject: [HyperDB] HyperDB and strange characters
Message-ID: <486237AA.1090901@plus.net>

Hi All

I've just been looking at using HyperDB on our Wordpress powered website 
(http://community.plus.net/) and have run in to an interesting issue in 
our testing environment.

If I define WP_USE_MULTIPLE_DB as true, then I appear to get some 
strange characters appearing in the Blog posts, but if i leave it set to 
false, then these characters disappear. They appear (in Firefox) to be 
white question marks in black diamonds.

Any ideas as to why this would appear with HyperDB and not appear 
without HyperDB?

Thanks

Colin

Yes, my idea is that HyperDB isn't doing SET NAMES in multiple-db
mode. I'm working on an update that includes a fix for this.

Cool, cheers Andy.

Although that was my initial thoughts too, I did try testing calling the 
SET NAMES query, but it didn't seem to do much, but then I've just 
realised that was me being a bit silly ($this->charset wasn't defined 
becuase that's done after the MULTIPLE_DB bit :))

However, just copying the code doesn't work, because $this->query tries 
to connect to the database in mutliple mode.

I've thought of just doing a straight "mysql_query" on it which may work?

If you come up with a better way and want me to test it please drop me 
an email (unfortunately, the platform I'm testing on is not available to 
the internet at large).

Cheers
Colin

My solution is to do mysql_query( SET NAMES... ) immediately after
successful mysql_connect in the db_connect method. Try that and let me
know whether it works for you.

Yep, that seems to have worked for me.

I've attached the patch I used to this email (it also includes another 
change to the query log just to include the hostname too :))

Message-ID: <e6ec604d0806261056h28673b77m116875e303d4ff58@mail.gmail.com>

I just committed a major update. HyperDB now works with WP trunk by
default, and it works with WPMU trunk with only a minor config change.
The installation directions have been updated.

The common stuff is abstracted into a class named "db". The "wpdb"
class extends the "db" class, adding the appropriate methods for WP or
WPMU. This was done because of differences in the way WPMU prefixes
table names.

There are still problems with the get_ds_part_from_table method using
prefixes. If you use that feature, tread carefully.

My tests were run on fresh trunk checkouts with a single database
server. Advances features haven't been tested. As always, test this on
a development platform before deploying to a production site. No
warranty, remember? :-)
