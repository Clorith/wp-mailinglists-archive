Subject: [HyperDB] HELP - is it possible to split a table across 2 databases
Message-ID: <CDBBC0DE.64D6%gavin@nous.com.au>


Hi all, 

I need to separate my wp_posts table into two databases based on post type.
So that post_type 'products' are in one DB and the rest reside in another
DB. 

Is this possible? Any suggestions or advice is very much appreciated.

Thanks

Gavin

HyperDB can not help you with that. The core-supported pattern for
multiple posts tables is multisite.

Good luck,
Andy
