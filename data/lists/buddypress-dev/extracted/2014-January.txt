Hey There, 


I don't know if you're a lottery player or not
but I've discovered something that needs a 
special attention: 

>> http://donix87.co.uk/lottery/index.php?sponsor=www.gad.samsung.com/?id=buddypress-dev at lists.automattic.com

I'm talking about a guy who pretends that 
he cracked the lottery code. 

More than that, he got shot in the foot 
for protecting his pattern. 

You can read the entire story here: 

>> http://donix87.co.uk/lottery/index.php?sponsor=www.gad.samsung.com/?id=buddypress-dev at lists.automattic.com

As far as I can see, he will reveal his secret
to only 300 people. The big question is if 
you qualify for this. 


Go on the page I give you and see all the 
details. 


Regards, 
Larry B.

p.s - it's been said that this system can get you 
a winner 5 out of 10 you play. Hmmm...hard to believe
but what if it is true?
