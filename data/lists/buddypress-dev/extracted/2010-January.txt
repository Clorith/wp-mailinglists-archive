First post of 2010 - let's see if anyone still subscribed here :-)

Hello all
One thing I see very often on the BuddyPress forums is people getting their heads around the concept of how forums are provided within groups, and that a typical "open" forum doesn't exist. Surely this is a great idea for a  plugin.  How do you think this is best done -- create, say, a public group and hook into BuddyPress so it isn't displayed in the group directory, etc? Another way I can see is to create a new record in wp_bb_forums but I imagine the BP group directory would iterate through the records and try to find a group based on the forum_name; what happens if it fails?

Thanks
