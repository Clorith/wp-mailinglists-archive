Subject: [buddypress-dev] How to activate WordPress users as BuddyPress users
Message-ID: <CAGcUGA-PQCWGdKFBazFhWPch3z0ELOZOadmkJva3r7T_X9eH4A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I automatically imported more two-thousands users as standard
WordPress users (subscribers).
After that I installed BuddyPress but now there is an issue: only
users have logged in at least one time are displayed as buddypress
members, all the others are not members yet.

How can I automatically synchronize WordPress and BuddyPress? Is there
some plugin or a simple way to synchronize them?

Thanks

I really don't think that buddypress maintains separate login tables from wordpress. Extended profile info, activity stream, etc are maintained separately.... But they are related by a key field. What do you mean by "synchronize"?

Pasquale,

You'll need to add a *last_activity* entry to the wp_usermeta table for
every imported user.

Thank all of you for your time and your suggestions.

@Michael: maybe I haven't been very clear, when I say synchronize I
mean that I would to create a buddypress profile for every user
haven't it now.

@Erick: exactly!!! Which value should I insert in this meta field? Can
i simply create the meta field using an empty value?

Pasquale,

I usually put an arbitrary datestamp, such as the site's launch date. I
suspect the meta value has to be a valid MySQL date so that BuddyPress can
parse it.

I suspect it too.

So I will try to launch a procedure that updates the last activity
value of all users with current timestamp.

Thank you very much

I think (I'm sure actually) this question was answered already in
previous threads regarding WP vs BP user profiles. It's a pity people do
not read archives.

HI Stas,

I'm a new member of this mailing list so I can access just few threads
of the global archive.

Anyway surely next time I will check the archive to find some answers
to my question.

Thanks

Subject: [buddypress-dev] bp_exists()
Message-ID: <1310296561.13085.5.camel@rivalry>

Hi,
I was looking for a better way to check if the components (my plugin
needs) are installed, and stumbled upon `bp_exists()`

I grep-ed through the BuddyPress codebase, but I couldn't find a usage
example, I was also unable to use it like this:
`
if( !bp_exists( 'xprofile' ) )
	wp_die();
`

Is this deprecated?

Maybe its worth using a profiler tool for the next version to cleanup
unreachable blocks of code in BuddyPress.

 bp_is_active() is what you're looking for.

How can I add a filter to the member list sorting?

someone has news about the last release? Is there some compatibility

In other words, can I update buddypress from 1.2.8 to 1.2.9 without to

someone has news about the last release? Is there some compatibility issue
in the updating from the previous version?

In other words, can I update buddypress from 1.2.8 to 1.2.9 without to be
worry? :-)

We?re running Wordpress 3.2 and BuddyPress 1.2.9 using BuddyPress Template
Pack 1.1.3 and hosting on Bluehost.

When I compose a message I enter all the fields ? Send To; Subject and
Message.

When I send the message I get?

There was an error sending that message1, please try again

I found where this message originates in the BuddyPress message.php
template. There are three places. I added a 1, 2, 3 to see which one is
causing the problem.

The 1 is for the a missing subject or content. After sending the message and
when the error messages appears the subject field remains filled in, but the
content field is blank. For some reason the content field is being wiped out
and seen as empty.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Art

 I suppose Template Pack might be out of date or need fixing because, in theory, if you haven't customised message.php etc, it ought to work. It might be worth seeing if you can find any recent discussion on the buddypress.org forums, and if not, posting a bug report on http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/

Upon further investigation I decided to replace the compose.php loaded from
BuddyPress Template Pack 1.1.3 with the compose.php template from the
default BuddyPress theme.

This fixed the problem.

Thanks to everyone who looked into this problem.
