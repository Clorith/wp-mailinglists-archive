Not to me, but if you're handing money out, I'll take some! :P

I got your email also, and still need to reply in depth, but I'm down to
help with wp-ecommerce. J

Hello all
One thing I see very often on the BuddyPress forums is people getting their
heads around the concept of how forums are provided within groups, and that
a typical "open" forum doesn't exist. Surely this is a great idea for a
plugin.  How do you think this is best done -- create, say, a public group
and hook into BuddyPress so it isn't displayed in the group directory, etc?
Another way I can see is to create a new record in wp_bb_forums but I
imagine the BP group directory would iterate through the records and try to
find a group based on the forum_name; what happens if it fails?

Thanks
Paul Gibbb

Hi everyone!,
*-Another way I can see is to create a new record in wp_bb_forums but I
imagine the BP group directory would iterate through the records and try to
find a group based on the forum_name; what happens if it fails?*-
Well, you can create all the "open" forums in wp_bb_forums and all of them
belong to the group_id=0, so this way, it can be very easy to iterate
through the records and to find all the "open" forums.

Hope to be helpfull :)
