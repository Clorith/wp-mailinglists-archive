BuddyPress certainly looks interesting...

Welcome to the list.

I'm here because I think blogs are already the ultimate profile, and I'm 
curious about how we can use open source, open standards, and a bitf WP 
fairy dust to spice things up a bit.

Well I'm here to keep tuned into BuddyPress and to see where and how  
it might benefit from bbPress and vice-versa.

I'm particularly interested in the idea of giving ad-hoc groups formed  
through BuddyPress the ability to create private forums.

Hi Guys!

Thanks for getting things started. I hope you enjoyed reading up on  
BuddyPress now that the site is live. I'll be adding to and refining  
the information on the site as the project progresses.

I'd still like to add more information on areas such as privacy and  
how we can use open standards to implement sharing of data.

Sam - some work has already started on how we can provide a BBPress  
forum to each group created within a BuddyPress installation. Chris  
Taylor who is helping me out with certain components of BuddyPress has  
already got a proof of concept going. I'll keep you up to date with  
that.

Andy

Andy,

I'm really excited to see this come to fruition.

I have a question about the database structure. Will BuddyPress address
the issue which WordpressMU has of duplicating the whole database
table each time a new user signs up?

Or do you think this is even an issue?

Thanks,

Armand

Hi everyone,

I'm here because Andy said I get a beer for every line of code. That's
true, isn't it?

As Andy said I've got the beginnings of this for a site I'm working
on: http://myjournal.com. You may be pleased to know that rather than
build my own forum from scratch I've used the bbPress database schema
and a few functions from the bbPress code. Basically I've set the
"Forum ID" field to be equal to the "Group ID" in my groups table, so
integrating this codebase through BuddyPress into bbPress shouldn't be
hard.

The site looks good Andy, well done.

BuddyPress is set of MU plugins, it doesn't change core MU  
functionality - which includes the DB schema.

Wordpress.com runs on MU and has proven that the system is both  
reliable and scalable. I don't think there is anything to worry about  
in that regard.

Most of the BuddyPress components utilize a single table, or a  
collection of tables.

Andy

Wasn't it that you'd buy *me* a beer for every line of code you  
contribute? Sounds much more likely to me. :)

Yep, I agree completely Andy. :) BP actually adds hardly any overhead 
near as I can tell. There's plenty of MU-based sites out there of all 
sizes - including large ones that really don't have much issues with the 
database structure. Either way, there's still the same amount of data to 
sort through. It only become unwieldy in phpmyadmin, and there are other 
ways around that.

Um, hi! *waves* I'm andrea_r from the forums and from wpmututorials.com. 
I'm here to keep up to date and figure it all out so I can explain it to 
the masses and help build documentation. :)

Very true. The overhead will decrease even more too as right now there  
are some hooked functions firing that don't need to. I'm going to  
clear those up soon.

Hi! Building documentation, that is always appreciated! Welcome to the

Hey Paolo, I'm using the internationalization functions religiously  
(__ and _e) so I'm hoping that translation will be fairly simple.  
Thanks for putting yourself forward.

Hey Trent,

The plugins use their own global tables right now. Some use single  
tables, others use a group of global tables. Some plugins also make  
use of data from blog tables and also the wp_usermeta and wp_signups  
tables.

Hello All,

I'm a PHP programmer with big ideas and I'll be following this project 
to see how it can help make some of my ideas a reality. :)

I can see BuddyPress becoming wildly successful as a basis for niche 
social networks on the Internet. I just posted some thoughts on my blog 
(raamdev.com) relating to WordPress MU and BuddyPress.

I can't wait to see this project develop and I'll definitely be testing 
and helping out where I possible!

Thanks!

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Could we know where to put the files that are
	available for testing on our Wordpress-mu sites?
Message-ID: <000c01c89464$8954dde0$9bfe99a0$@com>

I assume  that the theme goes in "themes" and plugins  go in  "mu-plugins",
but are all of the other files plugins or do some of them need to go in
another directory?

 

I tried placing the files that way and I couldn't even get a profile photo
to upload and considering how there were screenshots of  Buddypress with
Profile images, I have to think that maybe something isn't right.

 

I have several different installs of Wordpress-mu to test on and hopefully
give some useful feedback of what breaks and what doesn't.

 

I'm excited about this project. I've been looking for ways to add the
mentioned features like groups, friends, and personal photo album for
months.

And I'm another Paolo, who can write php and is eager to use  
BuddyPress in his next project :-)

Jon here,

I would not call myself a PHP programmer. I can edit, and troubleshoot to an
extent and love learning from what others do.

I host one Mu installation and a number of Wordpress Blogs for others. CMS
MadeSimple and Webscribble I have experience with as well.

I have a real interest in this project. It fits into one project already
live on Mu, and another in the conceptual stages. I have been working with
Wordpress for three years or more now. Any way I can help with beta testing,
I'm in. I have local installations of MU on XAMPP for windows and another on
a newly built linux machine.

I look forward to installing code in the works and see how I can be of
service.

BuddyPress is a MU Plugin, so any themes for MU will still work. What is
needed will be tags for the new features I am sure.

Hello & Howdy

Casey / misterbisson here. I've been thinking about developing some  
similar features for a while, but it's easier to join a going project  
than start one from scratch.

I'm eyeing this for implementation on our campus blog system (already  
an MU site) and perhaps also in the context of libraries. Cool stuff.

Seagyn is absolutely right, normal MU themes will work as long as you
can add the extra bits needed to handle new Buddypress features such
as groups etc. There will be a complete theme provided with BuddyPress
that theme developers can work from.

I believe you can already. :) Each feature is a separate file and an 
associated folder. So, aside from the core plugin you have:

Groups
Messages
Profile
Friends

Each one of those should be removable if you wish. I say "should be" as 
I haven't actually tried it yet :), but I believe it will do that from 
what I've read in the code and elsewhere.

I am new to being on a list so I hope I am writing to the correct address.
The thing is this:

   - Extended Profiles ? *I am interested in this (wanted)*
   - Personal Blog ?      *I am not interested in this (I do not want to
   change a single thing of the core features, especially to go from
   user/pageCreated to user/blog/pageCreated) and on top of that lose the
   ability to create pages (like Chickspeak) and only have the option to post
   *
   - Private Messaging ? *I am interested in this (wanted)** *
   - Friends ? *I am interested in this (wanted)*


   - Groups ? *I am interested in this (wanted)*
   - The Wire ? *not totally necessary, but usable***
   - Albums ? *This is not necessary as the system in place is already
   cool
   *
   - Status Updates ? *I am interested in this (wanted)*

Is there a solution for me? I don't mean to interrupt the process I just
want to see if this is even an option for my website.

Thanks for your help!

Can I get any of these to work without this?:

Personal Blog ?      *I am not interested in this (I do not want to change a
single thing of the core features, especially to go from user/pageCreated to
user/blog/pageCreated) and on top of that lose the ability to create pages
(like Chickspeak) and only have the option to post*


Thanks again

BuddyPress is a set of WPMU plugins, so you can choose whatever  
component you want and use only it, forgetting of the rest. And they  
are also all opensourced, so you can tweak (or ask someone to tweak)  
everything according to your taste.

By the way, if I were you I would allow some more than 8 minutes  
before bumping a thread, also because if you did read the archive of  
this same day, the answer you were looking for was expressed more than  
once. And this is just the second day of this list! :-)

We'll be creating new template tags that will render the BuddyPress  
functionality, similar to the template tags you use in WordPress themes.

Right now the default theme is for testing features so the tags are  
basically php code. These will be replaced with more friendly template  
tags.

Your best bet is to check out a copy of BuddyPress from SVN and  
install it on your servers. Bugs can be reported at the Trac server.  
The code is still in its fairly early stages but the extended profile  
and groups components are ready for more extensive testing.

Exactly, you can choose which components to install by only dropping  
those components into the mu-plugins folder.

The only one that is required is the "bp_core.php" file, which  
contains shared functions.

Hi Everyone

I've installed the latest version of BuddyPress yesterday on my local  
WordPress MU installation.

This release has me really excited about the possibilities of  
WordPress and WPMU.

I'm based in Vancouver as well (Hi Andy), and I've done some PHP  
development in the past. I'm looking forward to playing with this  
some more.

Hey folks,

Just wondering what the dev status of Buddypress is at it's current
point. Is it alpha/beta/rc? It looks like it's got a bunch of goodness
we'd like to use on the Metblogs.com network and I'm a PHP dev so I'm
more than happy to toss in on the development where I can but just
wanted to get some kind of idea what stage this is in before I start
tossing it onto our live sites.

Thanks!

I had placed the files like that page says. I was thinking that due to the
number of errors I was getting that some of the files really went somewhere
else.    

 

I'll try creating additional users and see if that makes the profile work.
I'd love it if someone could add a page explaining how errors should be
reported because I had quite a few and I'd like to report them correctly.

Message-ID: <60fe160a0804021547v5f69c991ue11240ad037bba52@mail.gmail.com>

Hi gang,

(Better let everyone know: I'm in the UK - well, the People's Republic
of Yorkshire - so my spelling of some words maybe a little strange!)

Everyone knows that people love to make lists. In several of the
popular social networking sites users can create lists of their
favourite books, movies or bands Thinking about that today I had an
idea - we could make that not just a feature, but a dynamic feature.
Here's the deal:

The BP admin installs the "Favourites" plugin and goes to set it up.
They decide they want people to be able to choose their favourite
books, movies and bands. They create those three new favourites
"types". For each of those types they have default fields (name,
rating, reason for choice) and a couple of configurable fields as well
(so they can enter artist for albums, author for books etc).

Users can then enter as many items as they want into each "type" -
books, movies etc - give them a rating etc. Their lists can appear
with a template tag on their profile favourites("books"). And if the
data is stored in a central table it should be easy to pull out global
top 10's, search favourites, see how often a certain book (or movie,
or cheese, or breed of dog) appears. The tables would be something
like (pseudo-SQL):

table wp_favourite_types (
id int,
title varchar(64),
slug varchar(64)
)

table wp_user_favourites (
id int,
user_id int,
favourite_type int,
title varchar(255),
rating smallint,
reason varchar(max),
field_1 varchar(max),
field_2 varchar(max),
field_3 varchar(max)
)

The power of this feature is it doesn't lock site admins down to only
getting a few types of the more usual favourites, but create their own
types if they want. So you want to see what everyone's favourite beer
is? No problem, just create the type "Beer". How about everyone's
favourite tree? Sorted.

Anyway, just an idea. What do people think?

Message-ID: <EE210EDF-23D5-4DAB-B14F-BBD38B960371@automattic.com>

One thing I haven't added to the BuddyPress site yet is how we are  
going to handle data portability.

This is a fairly hefty topic and I've heard a wide range of different  
ideas. I'm not completely set on an absolute direction for BuddyPress  
in this area yet. It is however something that is very important, and  
much needed in the social networking space.

These are my thoughts so far after having discussions with various  
people:

- Data needs to be as easy to get out as it is to put in.

- Sharing of data between BuddyPress installations should be as easy.  
You should be able to pull in data from one BuddyPress installation  
for use in other installations.

- There is no central information "hub" with BuddyPress. The DiSo  
project envisions using a basic WordPress installation as a place  
where you add your information to share with other networks. What if  
BuddyPress could utilize this, and pull in as much information from  
this source as possible when you first register? A BuddyPress  
installation could periodically check this source and ask if you  
wanted to import new information.

- The use of Microformats when rendering information so that it can be  
utilized by other non BuddyPress sources.

- The ability to completely export all of your data in 'X' format.

- The use of Gravatar to implement a shared profile picture library  
across all networks.

- The ability to finely tune privacy settings, and the creation of  
data access level groups. This would give you the ability to pick and  
choose the amount of data available to specific sites.

Lets discuss this area in more detail. I really want to hear people's  
thoughts and ideas on how we can make BuddyPress as distributed and  
open as possible.

Andy,

I'm glad you brought up this issue. I'm very interested in how BuddyPress
will shirk the silos.

First, the DiSo project: sweet. I love the idea of managing your social
information in one place and letting your networks leech it from there.
Awesome.

Honestly, before seeing your thoughts I was going to suggest that, for the
"currently doing" feature of BuddyPress, piping in Twitter feeds so that we
don't have to manage yet _another_ constant update mechanism. Now I realize
my thinking needs to switch from "use the popular silo" to "leave the silos
behind." Instead of pushing BuddyPress to use Twitter, Twitter needs to be
piping in my updates from where I keep it.

Anyway, enough of that. Just wanted to share my switch from one mode of
thought to another. Kudos, and I'll let this stuff keep percolating. 

Ryan

Hi gang,

(Better let everyone know: I'm in the UK - well, the People's Republic
of Yorkshire - so my spelling of some words maybe a little strange!)

Everyone knows that people love to make lists. In several of the
popular social networking sites users can create lists of their
favourite books, movies or bands Thinking about that today I had an
idea - we could make that not just a feature, but a dynamic feature.
Here's the deal:

The BP admin installs the "Favourites" plugin and goes to set it up.
They decide they want people to be able to choose their favourite
books, movies and bands. They create those three new favourites
"types". For each of those types they have default fields (name,
rating, reason for choice) and a couple of configurable fields as well
(so they can enter artist for albums, author for books etc).

Users can then enter as many items as they want into each "type" -
books, movies etc - give them a rating etc. Their lists can appear
with a template tag on their profile favourites("books"). And if the
data is stored in a central table it should be easy to pull out global
top 10's, search favourites, see how often a certain book (or movie,
or cheese, or breed of dog) appears. The tables would be something
like (pseudo-SQL):

table wp_favourite_types (
id int,
title varchar(64),
slug varchar(64)
)

table wp_user_favourites (
id int,
user_id int,
favourite_type int,
title varchar(255),
rating smallint,
reason varchar(max),
field_1 varchar(max),
field_2 varchar(max),
field_3 varchar(max)
)

The power of this feature is it doesn't lock site admins down to only
getting a few types of the more usual favourites, but create their own
types if they want. So you want to see what everyone's favourite beer
is? No problem, just create the type "Beer". How about everyone's
favourite tree? Sorted.

Anyway, just an idea. What do people think?

One thing I haven't added to the BuddyPress site yet is how we are  
going to handle data portability.

This is a fairly hefty topic and I've heard a wide range of different  
ideas. I'm not completely set on an absolute direction for BuddyPress  
in this area yet. It is however something that is very important, and  
much needed in the social networking space.

These are my thoughts so far after having discussions with various  
people:

- Data needs to be as easy to get out as it is to put in.

- Sharing of data between BuddyPress installations should be as easy.  
You should be able to pull in data from one BuddyPress installation  
for use in other installations.

- There is no central information "hub" with BuddyPress. The DiSo  
project envisions using a basic WordPress installation as a place  
where you add your information to share with other networks. What if  
BuddyPress could utilize this, and pull in as much information from  
this source as possible when you first register? A BuddyPress  
installation could periodically check this source and ask if you  
wanted to import new information.

- The use of Microformats when rendering information so that it can be  
utilized by other non BuddyPress sources.

- The ability to completely export all of your data in 'X' format.

- The use of Gravatar to implement a shared profile picture library  
across all networks.

- The ability to finely tune privacy settings, and the creation of  
data access level groups. This would give you the ability to pick and  
choose the amount of data available to specific sites.

Lets discuss this area in more detail. I really want to hear people's  
thoughts and ideas on how we can make BuddyPress as distributed and  
open as possible.

I totally second this part. Piping in or to popular things like Twitter 
is way better than yet one more thing. I already tweet enough! :D

Also, if there was some way it could check gravatars first for my avatar 
(which, honestly, I just use the same one everywhere) then that'd be 
very cool.

I would leave this out of BuddyPress by default, but someone could make a
plugin for it.

I'd like to see BuddyPress come as is out of the box not requiring other
services to use certain features.  Keep the core features of BuddyPress
within itself and then other developers can come in and make plugins for
whatever outside services they want to use.

In my ideal world I'd be able to manage all of my profile/social data  
in WordPress with fine grained control over who can do what with the  
data.  Similar to the way the Flickr application authorization works,  
it would be nice to have LinkedIn (just one example) contact my blog  
asking for data.  I can then approve it and specifically list what  
data it can read and write.  Instead of polling for new data,  
LinkedIn would be able to push updates (that I've authorized) back to  
my blog.

And there's no reason why this would need to be a one way thing.  If  
I change something in my profile that I've granted LinkedIn read  
access to, no reason why I shouldn't just push that data out to  
LinkedIn.

This doesn't have to be limited to traditional profile data either.   
The social graph data could also be passed back and forth.  If  
someone who only uses LinkedIn makes a contact request in LinkedIn  
and I approve it, that "relationship" could be pushed back to my blog  
(assuming I allowed LinkedIn to do that).

I used LinkedIn as an example because many people are familiar with  
it, but in this scenario WordPress could not only be a profile/social  
data server, but a client as well.  My WordPress blog could contact  
Bob asking for access.  Bob can then approve my blog and specify  
which data I can read or write and I can do the same on my blog.   
This way when I change my email address, my blog goes out and tells  
Bob's blog about this change and vice versa (assuming both blogs had  
the correct permissions to do so).  A decentralized profile/social  
data network.

Fine grained access settings is a major feature here.  I might want  
to share my mobile phone number with Bob, but not LinkedIn.

People said it wasn't scalable, but WordPress.com seems to be doing just 
fine.

It's probably premature, but for "fine grained access", OAuth might be
something to look into. I think it fits into the data portability
discussion by defining a common protocol for services to request
protected data. A quick visual overview can be seen here:

I agree with you Joseph.  Many of the larger social silos tend to
treat your blog as just another feed for their system.  Instead your
blog should be the heart of your social network and your online
identity.  In addition, I think that users are getting sick of
recreating a new profile every time they join a new site.  I think
there is an amazing opportunity here for Wordpress to provide this
functionality.

Currently there are a few plugins that enable lifestreaming:
http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2006/12/14/lifestream-wp-plugin-for-wordpress/
http://kierandelaney.net/blog/projects/simplelife/
http://rick.jinlabs.com/code/rss-stream/
I think these plugins provide excellent examples of how your blog
might serve as the heart of your online identity.

The next step would be to provide distributed Friend functionality.
Currently, we can use FOAF or XFN to distribute a blog roll.  It would
be really cool if your blog could have a 'friend request' button.
Pressing that would ask for the requestor's blog url (which is an
OpenID) which would then initiate an exchange that would allow the
friend request to be approved and then a relationship to be
established.   Those relationships could then be added to your blog
roll and then used to manage permissions.  Imagine being able to post
to your  blog and only allow friends with a given relationship the
right to see the post.  This would also lead to friendfeed like
functionality.  You would be able to see the activities of your
friends and perhaps even add it to a public page on your blog.  Your
blog would of course respect your friend's privacy settings.  The next
interesting addition would be the ability to make comments on anything
coming through that stream.  Their comments would then be distributed
back out so that friends could engage in an interesting, distributed
conversation based on any data they are generating in Flickr,
delicious, twitter, etc.  It would be nice if your blog could parse
Microformat encoded data embedded in your and your friend's feeds and
then distribute that back out as ical for your calendar and add the
data to your contact lists.

I wrote a couple of posts on this topic:
http://www.justinball.com/2008/03/04/note-to-facebook-myspace-and-other-social-silos-die/
http://www.justinball.com/2008/03/06/social-wordpress/

BuddyPress means there will be a truly open source social platform and
since Wordpress is so popular BuddyPress has a great users base to
build on.  This will allow thousands of niche networks to develop.  It
would be really cool if when joining a BuddyPress based community
instead of getting a new blog you could optionally use your existing
blog as your profile.  (It would still be important for users to be
able to sign up without a blog and get a profile on the site.)  If the
community site requires extra metadata it could request it from the
blog and the user could provide it - from within their blog.  Then if
they need to update the data they only need to update it in their
blog.  The BuddyPress community site could also request access to the
user's larger set of data - from flickr, delicious, etc.

I would love to see the BuddyPress ecosystem include a  plugin for
individual blogs that let's an individual user easily create groups
and invite their friends to join:
http://www.justinball.com/2008/03/05/disposable-communities/
http://www.justinball.com/2008/03/05/connected-communities/

Sorry to be long winded.  I think that Wordpress stands to really
change the social networking / community software space.  BuddyPress
is an exciting development.

Justin

Matt,

Thanks, and obviously by the success of Wordpress.com :) It seems
very scalable. Thanks for the clarification.

To everyone working on this project...
THANK YOU!

I have several mockups on a drawing board for ways to present wordpress as a social network, I am so glad that this is being developed with Automattic behind it!

A few thoughts..

I like the idea of being able to use gravatar images, but Iwould like for it to not be dependant upon gravatars, same with other services like twitter. It would be great if someone could do a plug in that could strip and populate information from a facebook / myspace page - perhaps main profile pic and basic info like city and such.. This would certainly get people to use it, and take ownership of it. I know someone had tried to create a plug in for phpfox that would strip an entire layout from myspace - backgrounds, constant tables, color schemes, etc. Not sure how feasible that it, but it would definitely be a major selling to a lot of users.

I think data portability should be a top priority, thank you Andy for taking this into consideration right off the bat! I also think privacy settings should be adjustable for everything, and some people may want to have a public photo section, a friends photo section, a family photo section, etc. Same with blogs, I'd like to see  the ability to make sub pages just for friends and other sub pages just for family.

Search is something we need to consider as well, it would be great to search all of your groups and friends to see who is playing the same game or whatever, but at the same time I may want to have my list if games searchable by my friends, but maybe keep my list of games or books or whatever out of the global search for the whole site / or public. Not sure if this has already been considered.

I look forward to hacking some themes out with various layouts in mind, will the buddypress template have comments in it stating something like "this will be a template tag, using the code here for now" kind of thing? If so I will jump right in, if not I look forward to some documentation coming together with template tags and possible modifications thereof.

Thanks so much everyone, I will contribute what I can...

PS Joseph - some good points there, I hope you will post those thoughts on a blog and not let them just get lost in this mailing list - I hope the whole internet gets on the data portability band wagon.

Just saying Hi to everyone (seems to be the norm right now)...

I'm Michael Kimb Jones (mkjones) and am very interested in using WP as
a Social Networking tool. I have used Drupal in the past but can't get
past its bulky and frankly quite scary codebase.

I work in the NHS (Web Developer) and use ASP.Net (boo!) 90% of the
time but dabble in PHP for personal and freelance projects.

I also run a small design studio - www.base6design.com - which I
started around 5 months ago and am still trying to get off the ground.

Wordpress is my passion for CMS and blogging work. I have a number of
sites which run it and love to hack it up and re-work it. Things you
just can't do with other publishing platforms.

I have 2 WP powered projects in the pipeline, one taking longer than
expected which I may swap over to buddypress if it will help me get
things moving.

That's about it for now. Nice to meet you all!

Cheers...

Hello guys.

Just migrated from Xoops to WP a few months ago and still not that familiar
with other flavors of WP and didn't even know that WPMU exist.

1. Would it be possible to export all my post in WP to BuddyPress?
2. Database is MSYQL. Is it also possible to export user accounts table from
WP and import it to BuddyPress table?

Hi developpers !

I'm Tom, 23yo french developper. I work as a freelance for wp blogs, plugins
and themes developper, CMS consultant for xoops, spip and drupal.
good skill for php, zend and Xhtml stuff ( css, xml...)

I install 2 or 3 wordpress blogs by month


My own biggest project with Mu runs at http://homeoftom.com  .
It was a game first since I host my friends and small projects for FREE
without ADS...yes I know, it's strange.. it'is a easy way to share my work
with my for customers too ( wp-signup is closed)
.I'am currently working on a new design.

Buddypress seems to be something very logical after the "mu concept" ..I
wrote a lot of code for better "user-profiling" .everything should be easier
now.very happy !


Just a note for specific and so peculiar wpmu developpers : I wrote a theme
based on about 50 options which allow a big choice of customizations for
something like a myspace theme without cloning any folder.. have a look at :
http://blog.homeoftom.com/    ( my own)
http://blond.homeoftom.com/
http://lapinnoir.homeoftom.com/
http://mgarbarczyk.homeoftom.com/

the "toopick theme" was inspired by the well-known "water" and offer css
options AND displaying options such as menu,bullets, sidebar
positions,exclude fonctions, flickr related account, mybloglog
widgetcolor.etc..

The design is very dirty...but it works..if someone would work on this,
welcome..

buddypress isn't another software, but a regular WPMU with some  
plugins. so, it share the same import/export xml standard of  
WordPress. you can export from WP and import in WPMU, just make sure  
to use the same version of the xml (WP 2.3.x  = WPMU 1.3.x)

I think you can overwrite directly your WPMU wp_users table with a  
WordPress one, the only issue I can imagine is that you need to have  
the same user ID range of the WPMU table (you'll need to have at least  
the userID 1 to admin the website, because while you import the XML  
file you can align every unknown author with a regular author, or  
create a custom one).

I would probably try that with everyone but the Site Admin(s). :) It's a 
little more than just userID 1.

Denmark calling ... and no, I'm not a cartoonist :-)

I mostly do simple PHP coding and webdesign, so I expect to lurk in
the shadow and offer my help for test and translation to danish, if
needed. One of my more techie "passions" is Server Architecture, like
how to design the server setup to assure availability, uptime, load
balancing, mirror scripts etc.

Recently I was *so* close to convert one of my main WP sites to
Drupal, but got "cold feets" just before the migration. Oh boy, after
I'd made the decission to stay with WP, I have become a much happier
man. The codebase of WP compared to Drupal, seems to be so much
lighter. And my webdesigner, that I do projects with, is so reliefed
that WP again is our chosen web-platform :-)

But it also gave me some insights into the Drupal world, which can be
interesting for ideas. Like the Organic Groups (OG) module, that seems
to be somewhat like BuddyPress.

So, looking forward to the BuddyPress "package" that I expect to
launch in production, as soon as the code is stable.

... someday I might ask for comments how to share user_table between
WordPress AND muWP/BuddyPress AND bbPress, but I don't expect this to
be the place for that talk.

Sk?l!

Ok, I was a bit light on describing this, you're right :-)
I was trying to explain that - basically - the two implementations are  
not really different, so I would try to play around those tables. But  
I have omitted the disclaimer: please, don't try this on a production  
website :-)

The use of external services to populate information within a  
BuddyPress installation is a nice idea. This would always need to be a  
secondary option though. You shouldn't have to sign up for accounts  
with other services to use all the features fully.

Joseph, excellent ideas, this really takes things a step further. One  
issue right now is that there is no solid standard for sharing profile  
data between networks. We'd need to create a new standard for sharing  
(hProfile?).

My biggest concern is making sure the process is easy for the average  
user, without confusing them. The idea that data can be fetched from  
and updated in other places is a foreign one to most.

I was just chatting with Chris Taylor, his idea was to approach it in  
a step by step way:

1. "Do you have a profile on another site? Just type your profile  
address in below and we'll try to get your details..."

2. If yes: "Great! We found your profile details on <site name>. Would  
you like to make your details there the same as here?"

3. Give more advanced users the option to provide a list of sites that  
they would like updated, or to fetch profile data from.

Of course the same could be done for connections, photos, status  
updates, etc.. but one step at a time. :)

Definitely. What if this relationship was pushed between all of your  
networks? If you connect with someone on one network who also exists  
on another network you are part of, you could be presented with the  
option of adding them there too.

Fine grained access settings are crucial, especially when you're  
pushing personal data around.

Hey Joe! Great to see you on the list, I hope things are going well  
with you.

Thanks for posting this info, OAuth looks like it could be really  
useful.

In addition to asking if they have a profile on another site you could
also ask for their blog?  To ensure that the blog really belongs to
them make the blog support OpenID.  The community site would be a
relying party and if they authentication is successful the new user's
profile information could be pulled from their blog.  If the user
wanted to contribute advanced data they would only need to check which
additional data to pull from their blog.  This could use RSS/Atom to
pull things like Flickr, Delicious, etc and XFN/Foaf for contacts.

Well sure, but don't let that get in our way :-)

This is why I mentioned something along the lines of what Flickr has  
done.  One example I ran into recently was that MarsEdit (a Mac blog  
client) has support for talking to Flickr to insert your Flickr  
images into blog posts.  Clicked on a button in MarsEdit, then it  
took me to my Flickr account (where I was already logged in) and  
Flickr asked me if it was ok to grant MarsEdit read access to my  
images.  I said yes and went back to MarsEdit, where it was now  
showing me all my Flickr photos.  What I didn't like about the  
experience was that the permissions were way too broad, but I feel  
that is completely a server side issue, nothing really to do with the  
client (MarsEdit).  Continuing with the Flickr example, it would have  
been nice to limit in some way, by tag for instance.

Like echoing out changes from one site to all your other sites?   
Quick example, I get a friend request on Facebook, which pushes that  
change to my blog profile (because I've already granted it permission  
to do, which I then approve.  My blog then looks at all the other  
sites (like LinkedIn) that I have permission to push this specific  
data out to and does so.  In this way my blog remains the hub of all  
my profile/social data.  And of course I could chose not to echo out  
that data, or only echo it out to specific other sites.

I've checked in a fix today that sorts out permission issues with  
profile pictures. You should now be able to upload new pictures and  
not get errors with new user signups.

Hello there y'all...

A quick introduction, I'm James from Edublogs.org and Incsub.com and
seeing as WPMU consumes about 90% of my working life am pretty excited
about BuddyPress :)

Am not much of a coder, more of a 'can we make it do that please' with
occasional theme hackery thrown in.

Cheers, James

Message-ID: <e370b8da0804031728t54636b5x153edc6f22f76f15@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Just wanted to say hi and introduce myself. I'm a long time SN portability
advocate from Australia. I am hugely excited to read that one of the core
intentions is for different installations of MU to share data - this is the
one critical function that has been missing from all SNs that I know of to
date.

I have had several WP blogs for the last couple of years for professional &
hobby purposes but not social, as nothing in WP seemed particularly
SN-oriented. I am overwhelmingly excited to see that is on the cusp of
changing.

I have just started playing with WPMU, and have an installation up on a site
I've only barely begun developing, http://canhasjournal.com which I will be
testing BuddyPress on. While I am not [really] a coder, my partner is, and
he has worked with WPMU in the past and is about to do a fresh install for a
professional site he is a developer for, and between us I'm sure we'll be
able to contribute usefully to the project.

Cheers!

Cass Edwards

Hi All,

I've used WordPress for personal use for several years as well as running a
WPMU site at the University of New England, Australia for just over a year
now. UNE is very interested in BuddyPress.

I wouldn't call myself a great PHP coder but I do have a knack for debugging
and troubleshooting.

I hope I can contribute something useful to the project.

This is the big fix I was waiting for!  Is there any way to display the
other files that were uploaded besides the main profile pic?

Hi everybody, I'm Luca, an italian developer, I have develope many
extensions for Joomla! end work with zend frameworks. I have seen wp mu and
I have a customer that want it with same extensions like buddypress. :-)

I have installed all extensions that I have took into svn, I see that they
aren't complete but some of these are almost finished.

I see that there is an update today that fix delete of images into profile,
but there will be the possibility to delete an image without make it the
'current image' of profile?


Sorry for my poor english. :-(

Yes, I'm just working out the best way to handle that in the

People love making lists and see how their favourites compare with  
others, so naturally this would be a good extension component. Lets  
keep this one in mind for when we have the core stuff stable and  
completed.

Not right now. They will just display in the "previously uploaded"  
column. Once the album component is completed, I see no reason why we  
couldn't pull in inactive profile photos to display publicly as well.

Hey James, great to see you on the list. Hopefully BuddyPress will be  
useful
for Edublogs and Incsub when the time comes.

Message-ID: <F9D902EC-3C1E-4F3D-AB46-5CC722F77C7B@automattic.com>

I just noted a thread in the MU forums regarding concerns about  
removing the blog as the main focus. I just want to clear this up.

This is all handled within the theme files. This means that anyone can  
create a custom theme (or modify an existing one) and keep the blog  
front and center. This would not affect the other components as they  
can still be rendered anywhere you like using the correct template tags.

It might even be an idea to create two bundled themes, one for a  
Facebook like experience, and another for blogging with social  
networking features.

All I'm really saying here is that the BuddyPress plugins don't force  
the blog into a secondary position. That is up to you as theme  
developers. Currently, the default theme just handles it this way. I'm  
clearing this up on the website right now.

Not at all, the website spelled it out this way and I didn't clarify

Hi Guys,

Just wanted to throw my greetings out as well in the early stages  
here. Been coding with Wordpress since version 1.5 and happy to see  
BuddyPress taking WP in this direction. I've actually been coding some  
plugins myself similar to BP and now will be focused on related  
plugins that I don't see as the core of BuddyPress.

Newsletters are harder for me to follow that tweets and blog posts -  
is there an official blog for BP?

Anyways, greetings from South Florida. If you are on twitter and wanta  
talk BP, i'm @dimensionmedia.

Thanks.

David

The next question would probably be what is the best way to
contribute?  If we hope to develop a plugin that enables some social
networking functionality in individual blogs that can integrate with
BuddyPress would it be best to just start building something and then
contribute parts of the code back at some point?

Thanks again for BuddyPress and all your work.  This is an awesome project.

Thanks,
Justin

Hi Justin,

The bottom line for us is that we want to make BuddyPress a set of
plugins which a) don't require any changes to the Wordpress MU core
code and b) can be installed separately at will. So if you do
something make sure it can live happily with other plugins and doesn't
require any hacks and it should be fine.

Thanks very much, any ideas you've got would be gratefully received.
What did you have in mind?

Yes, I agreed with chris. I just joined this group. I just wanted to know if new version of wp mu like wp 2.5 going to work with buddypress. Could we use buddypress now or will it be a final release along with new version of mu?

Hi Justin,

The bottom line for us is that we want to make BuddyPress a set of
plugins which a) don't require any changes to the Wordpress MU core
code and b) can be installed separately at will. So if you do
something make sure it can live happily with other plugins and doesn't
require any hacks and it should be fine.

Thanks very much, any ideas you've got would be gratefully received.
What did you have in mind?

Chris

With the many changes in WP2.5 we expect an update to MU soon, but it
may take a little time. Donncha and his team are superheroes, but they
can't perform miracles :0)

David: thanks for that, excellent stuff. I've added a quick comment.

I didnt expect that WP.com updated with features of 2.5 today. I am going to sign in and see how it goes! I really wanted to start my project with new wp mu instead with 1.3.

Chris, thanks for the compliment. Appreciated the comment on the post.

I think the thing Justin and I are interested in doing is implementing
a "distributed BuddyPress" where folks don't have to belong to the
same WPMU install in order to be friends, message each other, etc. Of
course, our first priority is to help BuddyPress as currently
conceptualized succeed. And immediately after that we would like to
try to more fully distribute so that folks can add friends across WPMU
installs, etc. So I think we're sort of in sync on that...

Sup everyone,
I'm somewhat of a theme designer. I'd say more of a theme tweaker. When not
in the virtual world I reside in Chicago. Been following everyone's comments
for a couple days. Lots of good ideas. Hope Andy can sort through them and
work it out. I'm totally excited about BuddyPress.

Regarding BP users not needing to belong to one install of WPMU is a
brilliant idea. However, I hope that would be an optional feature of BP. I
have a bunch of clients that would prefer a closed network version of BP
verse wide open. It would be cool if the owner has an option to a open or
closed social network version of BP then users should somehow have an easy
option to copy profiles across WPMU installs to encourage joining other
networks.

Unfortunately for ya'll I'm more of an idea guy rather then implementation
guy. So I'll leave that to the professionals.
Lurking ;)
Brian

Hi David, this sounds excellent. I think both Chris and I know what we'd
like to accomplish, but have somewhat limited knowledge in the  
technologies
needed to implement those ideas.

Having people who are highly knowledgeable and can help out in these  
areas
would be a massive boost, so thanks to you and Justin for putting  
yourselves
forward.

Andy

When I first started developing BuddyPress I approached it like a  
Facebook-style mentality. All users would have the same theme and  
wouldn't be able to change this. My thoughts and opinions on this are  
changing now, having talked more to the community, and seen the  
potential to make something different from the norm.

The presentation tab will return, but we need to have more than one  
possible theme before this can happen. If a user switches to a theme  
that is not set up for BuddyPress then things are going to break.

Site wide administrators should still see the presentation tab.

Just noticed that I lost the Manage Pages section with BuddyPress.  The
actual pages still exist but the content doesn't display.  Is there
something I'm missing?

Themes are a complex area in BuddyPress. For one thing the layout for
site-wide lists of groups might need to be different than a users
groups. Therefore there is a difference between site and user themes.

Checking if themes are BuddyPress compliant can be handled on two
levels. Firstly we could require a special line in their style.css to
indicate whether it is a site or user theme.

The system could then check for the presence of required files (such
as groups.php).

Some more thinking needed on this. Plus I'm posting from a phone!

I'm glad this is being discussed further. WordPress attracts users that are
generally more tech-savvy than social networks like Facebook, so I think by
aiming for a Facebook-like product a lot of potential BuddyPress admins and
end users may be turned off.

If there was a social network which BuddyPress should be aiming to emulate,
I'd definitely pick LiveJournal - blogs on LJ have much more customisation
options, already in many ways similar to WordPress.  So, once the BuddyPress
core is completed, next step is for different installations to share data,
then I hope, solo WordPress installs can come to the party too? The last
step I see great potential for growth, as many WP users want SN
functionality, but want to maintain complete control over their blog. As far
as I know there are no plugins existing or in development to make solo WP
blogs SN-connected - which is why I found BuddyPress, as I was looking for a
solo WP solution initially.

Message-ID: <20080405230553.8jakt72dk48s0oss@www.dimensionmedia.com>

Team,

I still seem to be getting the following error when attempting to  
upload a profile picture:

"Unable to create directory  
/var/www/vhosts/dimensionsites.com/httpdocs/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/. Is  
its parent directory writable by the server?"

The blogs.dir directory is writable (777) from what I can see from the  
server (as is wp-content), so i'm not sure exactly what the problem  
is. I just downloaded the latest version of the files from trac  
eariler today.

I can create the folders myself via FTP. When I do this the image says  
"successful upload" but doesn't appear in the backend at all.

Some assistance would be appreciated, since it seems this works for others.

Thanks.

David Bisset

Hello all.  

Josh from Texas here.  I've been following the mailing list for the past
few days, and I just noticed on the project status wiki that group
forums based on bbpress is a planned feature.  So how will this forum
functionality work? As in, will groups be able to create new forums from
their admin pages? Will the bbpress tables be part of the same database?
Will the bbpress code be required as part of the buddypress core?
Etc.... 
Sorry so many questions, I'm just intrigued by the idea of kinda
blending bbpress and buddypress together and having forums be creatable
by the users.   
Awesome stuff so far.  

Thanks,
~ Josh

Hi.

The version currently in development uses the WP database and its own
code, so doesn't require bbPress to be installed. It's been written so
it can easily integrate with a full bbPress install, but we're just at
the start with this so would appreciate any ideas.

At the moment there's just 1 forum per group and it's only visible by
group members, but I know the bbPress guys and us are keen to make
this a great feature.

Message-ID: <60fe160a0804060737u2c48ded6h668c2cc1e6143241@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been thinking about the data portability issue recently and would
like some input on the 'friends' aspect. Some of the discussion so far
shows that some of the functionality required by a social network
'friends' feature can be handled well by the existing Wordpress
blogroll: which can contain a list of URIs which can be tagged with
XFN. One of the things BuddyPress could do (and also make a wider
Wordpress plugin) is handle the import/export and synchronisation of
these lists through OPML. That's relatively straightforward.

However there are other things that a friends application does that a
blogroll (currently) can't. Off the top of my head here's a few:

- Display the current status of each friend
- Display the latest post from each friend
- Show what topics your friends have been posting on
- Display recently-added photos from friends
- Compare favourites etc. with friends

I'm sure there are lots more (each of these may need a separate format
so they can be implemented separately). When the user and their
friends are in the same system, i.e. the same database, it's pretty
easy to make all these things happen - it's just a question of SQL
queries. But if these friends are going to be spread about not just
around the same site, but also blogs and other SNs then things start
to get hairy. The amount of data that could need to be transmitted
every time a user wants to check for their friends updates could be
prohibitive for site admins wanting this feature.

So my thoughts are that a users friends list *shouldn't* go to their
friends to see if data has changed. Instead when someone, for example,
updates their status that new text should be sent to anyone in their
friends list. Here's an example.

Bob and Dave are friends. Dave updates his status text, and the change
gets posted (using RPC?) to all of Dave's friends, including Bob. The
next time Bob logs in he sees Dave's latest status.

This minimises the amount of remote polling because friends' sites are
only called when there is has been an update made - not to check if
there *has* been an update made. It can also be made secure, because a
user could set their status updates to "everyone", but their photo
gallery updates only to "family".

Lastly it puts the status of the friendship under the data senders
control. Another example:

Jack has said he is Jill's friend. But Jill isn't Jack's friend, ever
since that part at Bob's house where he got a bit frisky by the punch
bowl. Jack might want to know when Jill updates her status message so
he can harass her, but he isn't going to get those notifications
automatically because he isn't in Jill's friends list. And because
Jack isn't in Jill's friends list she can say whether she wants to see
notifications from him or not, by leaving the "View updates from
people who say they are your friend (but you haven't said you are
theirs)?" box unchecked.

Any thoughts?

This does sound way better than checking to see if there's been an 
update first. From a user perspective, I love the lj-like friends 
feature. Users also want control and a sense of privacy. From an MU 
admin perspective, I'd like to see the focus on network-wide first and 
then maybe add from outside systems later.

 Hi, It's Wessel in Canada and here is the two cents of a lurker.

> When I first started developing BuddyPress I approached it like a

Users being able to tweak their BuddyPress theme(s) is fantastic, as is
users having their own themes on an installation, but I would also like to
echo the thoughts of others earlier that I hope that BuddyPress allows as an
option for a uniform look and cohesion, which users them can change if they
wish and if the admin will allow them.

All the projects I would like to attempt with it would require that.

**Personalized activity feed**

Secondly, the core features that BuddyPress have now does not seem to
include an activity feed. It is the simple but brilliant idea of an
personalized activity feed that set Facebook apart form other social
networks IMHO. Any plans for one?

Thanks for an amazing project.

I don't use FB, but I know in MU you can wrangle all kinds of separate 
feeds via plugins. Soooo.... I'd say if it isn't planned, it's probably 
possible. :D

I've never used LJ - what friends features does it have?

I think we're definitely going to look at local friends first, but it
may be possible to do it in such a way that makes global friend
networks easier to do. Privacy options will also be baked in as early
as possible, as it's an important area.

Hi Wessel, welcome on board.

You mentioned two different levels for users to change their theme:
changing it wholesale, using the "Presentation" tab or tweaking an
existing theme. I can imagine that a lot of people will want this
second feature, so they can give some flexibility of style without
having to create entirely new themes. Therefore they give their users
some degree of control, within regulated boundaries.

And I think I know the way to do it. Bear with me, this is
stream-of-consciousness stuff.

A theme developer could create a theme and insert "theme keywords"
(needs a better description) at certain points. For example, they
might set some inline CSS that controls the colour of the header div,
and use a function like theme_keyword("header_bg"). In the "Site
Admin" tab would be a new page called "Theme keywords" where you could
set a theme keyword, in this case "header_bg" and set the options you
want to be available for people. For example: "red", "green", blue"
etc. The site admin would also be able to set which one is the
default.

Users would then be able to select which of the predefined colours
they want for their theme header. This system could be used to do many
things in the theme PHP files, including inserting images and text,
configuring CSS, even turning on or off entire sections of the page.
The flexibility would be entirely down to the theme designer and site
admin working together.

Anyway,thanks for the idea.

Regarding the "**Personalized activity feed**", this is something we
already have working in myJournal (http://myjournal.com) and works
very well. When that site goes live you'll be able to see it in
action. But the short answer is it's not hard to do and would be a
great addition to BuddyPress.

Is what your talking about not the personalized activity feed we referred to
earlier? Personalized in that its based on what your friends are doing on
BuddyPress?

Your list I would see as follows, a feed that

- Includes the current status of each friend when it changes
- Includes a link to the latest post from each friend when a post is made
- Show what topics your friends have been posting on (do you mean tags or
categories?)
- Includes links to recently-added photos from friends when these photos are
added to a gallery
- Compare favourites etc. with friends (not sure how this would work)
- Include links to bookmarks of friends when these are added.
- Include links to a comment of a friend when they do comment.

Something like that. If its not like a news feed and it just shows the
latest post/ picture by friends regardless of how long ago it was made, it
looses some of its magic don't you think?

Exactly the feature from Drupal OrganicGroups (OG) I'd falled in love
with. Could be awesome if BuddyPress got this functionality :-)

There's no reason this couldn't be its own 5-line plugin that could be 
included with BuddyPress and optionally enabled if a blog admin wants.

Could it be as simple as an if_function_exists?

Granted this is still early stage, but I've noticed with BP running, if 
another theme is selected there's just a blog, no BP features 
(naturally, since they aren't in the theme).

Sort of, however the friends system *could* have some more advanced
features. What those are I'm not sure, but they could include
comparing data between user and friend.

I've clarified the list below:

>  - Includes the current status of each friend when it changes
Absolutely, I would say this is the most important thing

>  - Includes a link to the latest post from each friend when a post is made
Yep, very important

>  - Show what topics your friends have been posting on (do you mean tags or

Sorry, I should have made this clear. I meant what forum topics (for
example in bbPress) they were writing in

>  - Includes links to recently-added photos from friends when these photos
> are added to a gallery
Yes, definitely. Being able to show a thumbnail would be great as well.

>  - Compare favourites etc. with friends (not sure how this would work)
This would be a VERY clever system to do this. I think for the initial
version of BuddyPress this just isn't going to happen.

> - Include links to bookmarks of friends when these are added.
Yes, great idea. That is a sort of del.icio.us type feature, I suppose.

> - Include links to a comment of a friend when they do comment.
If you mean when a friend comments on someone else's blog then that's
very, very tricky. There might be a way to do it but my mind currently
can't figure it out.

Yes, I agree. Maybe showing updates from the last few days would be
enough. Perhaps the user could even set how far back they want to see
by default, to handle the different number of times different users
might log in per week. Of course archives would be good as well, so
people can catch up after being offline for a while, for example.

Thanks for these good ideas. Wessel, are you a developer? Do you have
some time to help with BuddyPress?

I wish I had more coding skills, but I'm afraid I can only tweak code, not
realy write it. I work as a Web Producer and Web strategy consultant. I do
have a bit of time to help but the most practical skills I can best
contribute is use cases, wireframes, usability tests, bug testing and ideas.

Recent friend activity could show a few items on the dashboard, with a second dashboard page showing more recent items with more friends. It would be nice to choose which items to keep an eye on with different friends - some you may want to know about new pics, some you may want to ignore bulletins and blog posts. I sure wish I could ignore one of my friends bulletin feeds on myspace.

Has there been any testing / consideration about urls? I know some plugins have had issues with sublog.wpmuinstall.com as opposed to wpmuinstall.com/sublog. I think a lot of users out there are use to  http://myspace.com/mypage - and I have seen some issues out there with doing it that way. I'd like to launch one that way. my other wpmu's are the other way for now.

I am VERY glad that the thinking has evolved to include multiple theme options - will there be a wiki or something for documenting the theme tags? I am very interested in this area - will help with documentation to whatever degree I can be helpful, and will be doing what I can to develop theme options from what i have on the drawing board.

Of course it should be an option for admins if they want to have multiple themes available to end users or not. We should also have the ability to offer a paid feature for premium members to have more themes or different themes.

Would it make sense to have two checkboxes next tot he user(author) fields that users could select for exporting information? Like a checkbox to export to friends or export off site. This way you could create an rss feed(?) of your own user details that could be sucked in by another wordpress install or open id kind of thing? If so I could check off my username, nickname, birthday and bio information as exportable off site, but keep my AIM id on site only, or friends only. We could also have a check box to include booklists or bookmarks (or sub bookmarks (which could include urls of friends for friends lists) - if this created a custom rss url it could be shared that way... 

I think it would be cool to have the option for a permanent url with this custom selected info, or have the url expire after a selected amount of time (24 hours) - so it could be used for importing elsewhere temporarily.

wpmuinstall.com/yourpage/feed=publicuserinfoexport.rss

Of course I imagine that different networks will have different info, and many will want to have custom fields - so the universal formatting will be an issue. I see some sites have fields for birthday, and some have astrological signs and marriage status etc. Some people may want to include their work info, and some sites will have custom fields for god knows what else
.
Some random thoughts - haven't finished my first cup of coffee yet - hope it makes sense and others can add to this process to create the functional yet flexible beast BP is becoming.

Is what your talking about not the personalized activity feed we referred to
earlier? Personalized in that its based on what your friends are doing on
BuddyPress?

Your list I would see as follows, a feed that

- Includes the current status of each friend when it changes
- Includes a link to the latest post from each friend when a post is made
- Show what topics your friends have been posting on (do you mean tags or
categories?)
- Includes links to recently-added photos from friends when these photos are
added to a gallery
- Compare favourites etc. with friends (not sure how this would work)
- Include links to bookmarks of friends when these are added.
- Include links to a comment of a friend when they do comment.

Something like that. If its not like a news feed and it just shows the
latest post/ picture by friends regardless of how long ago it was made, it
looses some of its magic don't you think?

Exactly the feature from Drupal OrganicGroups (OG) I'd falled in love
with. Could be awesome if BuddyPress got this functionality :-)

There's no reason this couldn't be its own 5-line plugin that could be 
included with BuddyPress and optionally enabled if a blog admin wants.

Could it be as simple as an if_function_exists?

Granted this is still early stage, but I've noticed with BP running, if 
another theme is selected there's just a blog, no BP features 
(naturally, since they aren't in the theme).

Sort of, however the friends system *could* have some more advanced
features. What those are I'm not sure, but they could include
comparing data between user and friend.

I've clarified the list below:

>  - Includes the current status of each friend when it changes
Absolutely, I would say this is the most important thing

>  - Includes a link to the latest post from each friend when a post is made
Yep, very important

Sorry, I should have made this clear. I meant what forum topics (for
example in bbPress) they were writing in

>  - Includes links to recently-added photos from friends when these photos
> are added to a gallery
Yes, definitely. Being able to show a thumbnail would be great as well.

>  - Compare favourites etc. with friends (not sure how this would work)
This would be a VERY clever system to do this. I think for the initial
version of BuddyPress this just isn't going to happen.

> - Include links to bookmarks of friends when these are added.
Yes, great idea. That is a sort of del.icio.us type feature, I suppose.

> - Include links to a comment of a friend when they do comment.
If you mean when a friend comments on someone else's blog then that's
very, very tricky. There might be a way to do it but my mind currently
can't figure it out.

Yes, I agree. Maybe showing updates from the last few days would be
enough. Perhaps the user could even set how far back they want to see
by default, to handle the different number of times different users
might log in per week. Of course archives would be good as well, so
people can catch up after being offline for a while, for example.

Thanks for these good ideas. Wessel, are you a developer? Do you have
some time to help with BuddyPress?

Chris

Hi Steve,

Wow, loads of thoughts. Here's a few off-the-top-of-my-head comments:

On Mon, Apr 7, 2008 at 5:23 AM, Steve Bryan <djsteve007@yahoo.com> wrote:

Yes, the only problem is going to be the "privacy matrix" this
requires. We want to keep Buddypress as simple to use as Wordpress so
the technical barrier for entry is still low. Th current thinking is
that there will be different levels of administration, so maybe this
"I want to see this kind of update from this person, and that kind of
update from that person" could be in a power user area. It would be
pretty useful.

Maybe Andy has something to say on this, but as far as I know
Buddypress will work with both URI types.

Help with documentation would be great, you might like to contact
Andrea about that (I think she's the one with the gold-plated pen).

Well, it's not up to me to discuss premium anything, but we will
definitely be giving site admins these options. After all, it's part
of WPMU already.

With the aim of keeping things simple, it may be best to start with
privacy setting such as "Family, Friends, Group members, Site, Global"
which will map with your suggestion. What level of detail we go to
depends on what Andy wants to do with his XProfile feature (but as
different profile information is grouped it might be possible to set
privacy levels at a per-profile-data-group level)

Possibly, alhough with OpenID and OAuth the expiry might not be necessary.

yes, this is the major problem we've got with exporting/importing
profiles. Past the basic data (name etc) anything goes. Still, there
are smart people thinking about this so we're bound to come up with a
good solution soon.

When I gave my examples on this I specifically didn't mention a  
transport mechanism, but I was thinking XML-RPC :-)

I very much prefer active notification to polling.

This goes back to the discussion on fine grained control, which I  
think everyone has agreed is a good thing.

What about using RSS or Atom to move friend data around.  It seems
like we could use that format for all of these:
>  - Display the current status of each friend
>  - Display the latest post from each friend
>  - Show what topics your friends have been posting on

If we use a standard format we can also use existing libraries to
parse the data.  Other developers will also be able to use similar
libraries both in Wordpress and on other platforms to do the same
thing.  I think that to get broadest adoption we need to stick as
close to common, simple formats as possible.

On each persons BuddyPress dashboard will be recent activity log of  
all your friends on BuddyPress. The activity feed could be based off  
this and include all this sort of information.

This is a consideration definitely. We need to concentrate on getting  
the basic features out there to begin with, then nailing down more  
finely grained customizations once there is a solid base.

I'm only testing on subdomain.domain.com at the moment, but there is no
reason BuddyPress this shouldn't work on both.

Like Matt mentioned earlier, this will either be a plugin to disable/ 
enable
this feature, or we will make it an admin option.

We'll be starting with grouped privacy settings as Chris mentioned. We  
don't
want to overcomplicate to begin with. No reason why this couldn't be  
handled in
the future though. Someone may even write a plugin.

I've asked Barry to set up a mediawiki installation at  
codex.buddypress.org at some point this week. I'll let you know when  
he has that going. It's the same system used for the Wordpress codex.

Great stuff! Bear in mind that there is a new change set almost  
everyday right now, so it would need to be kept up to date.

That's fantastic, a working example would be extremely useful.

Subject: Re: [buddypress-dev] Portable friends
To: buddypress-dev@lists.automattic.com

Hmmm. To expand a little on what Andrea has said about LJ -

The LJ friends system is far more customisable than any other SN I am aware
of, but it works on a backbone of RSS, which makes it wonderfully portable.
You have complete control as a user over the different levels of security
both for what other people see [on the authoring site as well as through
feed readers with auth=digest], and what you read. The friends list on-site
functions as both an RSS reader as well as a security filter for outgoing
data. Users can define any number of security levels too - your basic
"friends-only" filter is a default, and includes everyone on your friends
list, but you can create new filters and choose which users are included -
this works well for posts about specific interests, geographically located
groups etc. You can make a filter which includes only one person other than
yourself if you want, making it like a private messaging system, as comment
discussions in such groups take the place of email. There is also a default
"private" option, like WP has. You can also add communities and public RSS
feeds to your friends list, making it a very good base to view most of the
content you want to see online: SN+RSS=WIN!

Having expounded upon its complexity, I really don't think it would be too
hard to implement something similar[+improved] using a different codebase
[LJ is written in Perl]- while LJ has added many features over the years,
friends filters have been around for a very long time, and are implemented
on a new account with only basic default options - but getting that
groundwork done right the first time I think would save a lot of work if
people are interested in having these features later down the track. It can
be kept pretty easy for new users to understand, but has the options for
advanced users too.

I have seen people attempting to achieve a similar effect on WP by using the
"Role Manager" plugin, but the functionality is very limited as it only
deals with one side of the equation ie doesn't include an aggregated viewing
function. The other main problem is that users can't be placed into more
than one group - so if you're trying to organise friends-only readers on
your WP blog, currently it's all or nothing.. similar to myspace, and you
have similar issues with sites like Flickr, where people can be classified
as either friends AND/OR family - horribly suboptimal, and feels draconian
if one is used to the LJ system. I want some people to be classified as
"people who share my pathological interest in photographs of bottle caps"
dammit! I could also compare it to the difference between Gmail's labels,
and a traditional email file system - and I can't imagine going back to an
email system that doesn't include labels.

I think it would be a terrible shame for the BP developers to not at least
look at the LJ system to see the simplicity, but also great power, of
user-customisable security settings for the friends feature at the very base
level of functionality.

Is there anyway to run BuddyPress on a standalone version of WordPress?  If
not, is there plans to do so?

Thanks for setting this up Andrea!

I'm currently working on fixing up the plugins to work with the latest  
WPMU build and the new interface design. I'll be committing this later  
today, so anyone running WPMU 1.3.3 will likely need to upgrade to the  
latest build, I'm not sure yet if the new tweaks will be compatible  
with the old interface.

Hi Joshua,

No, BuddyPress is intended to be a set of plugins for Wordpress MU. In
the future there *may* be some features of BuddyPress that can tie in
with a standalone Wordpress installation, but that's a long way off
yet.

Chris

Andy added some fixes for the profiles stuff last night, so anyone
currently testing it should download the latest version.

Remember, this is still in alpha and *everything* is liable to break.

I tend to think it leads to a large but detailed to-do list. :D

I've just committed revision 20. This will fix the interface issues  
with the new WP2.5 administration area. Thumbnail filenames had  
changed in 2.5 which meant the profile picture functionality had  
broken. This has now been fixed, once the test server is updated you  
should be able to upload and select profile pictures.

Andrea - can you activate the BuddyPress default theme so that  
profiles render correctly?

Thanks
Andy

**** NOTE: ****

BuddyPress now requires a WPMU version greater than 1.3.3, which means  
for now you will need to use the latest trunk. Hopefully an official  
version will be out next week.

Yep, it was there before, but I didn't catch how users couldn't reach 
the Presentation tab, so I've now made it use the BP theme by default on 
new signups. Oddly enough, I could type in the URL and reach it, but I 
don't know if that's because I'm the site admin (ie; I haven't  read the 
code yet ;) ).

If anyone else wants to try it, it's just wp-admin/themes.php. The BP 
theme screenshot looks like Kubrick, but in reality it looks like this: 
http://testing.testdrivewpmu.com/blog and if you can't get to it, I'll 
be editing a few users tomorrow to switch it.

The only other thing I noticed was that going back to the signup page 
while logged in, and trying to set up another blog, sends me off in a 
circle of no explanation. That behavior definitely needs to be 
documented. :D

If you are logged in as the site admin and head to the "Site Admin >  
Themes" tab, disable all the themes other than "BuddyPress Profile  
Default". That way all users should be forced into using the correct  
theme.

Multiple blogs is going to be an issue with BuddyPress. In fact, the  
plan right now is to limit one user to one blog. With BuddyPress, the  
administration area represents the person, and not the blog. This  
causes a problem when administering multiple blogs. Which admin area  
would you go to to check your messages or add a new photo?

I can see ways around this, but for simplicities sake, one blog for  
each user is the route we are taking for the time being. I haven't yet  
added the code to stop the registration of multiple blogs, which is  
why you are getting the run around. :)

Also, to clarify, on http://testdrivewpmu.com accounts created before  
revision 20 will still receive an error. You'll need to add a new  
profile picture to fix this, as the default image wasn't copied over  
correctly when pre revision 20 accounts were created.

Only if they go to choose a new theme. :) If a currently selected theme 
is active for a blog, and it is then deactivated sitewide, it still 
remains on the blog. It just gets removed from the presentation area.

If I physically remove the old default theme, then everyone would revert 
to the theme under the "default" folder, which is now the buddypress one.

Couldn't you just have the first blog the user creates be the default one

G'day BP floks,

I had hoped to be giving some input by now. I have run into a major hosting
issue that has made my beta install abilities nill for a short time. I am
working on new hosting at the moment and will become active ASAP. This
project is something I want to be an active part of.

I am following the conversation with great interest and hope to be migrated
to new digs soon. Once that mountain is climbed my beta install will go up
and I can begin offering input.

Side-lined at the moment but not for long.

Jon

We see the issue with a number of plugins that don't check to see if
the files directory has been created yet.  Arne Brachhold's sitemap
generator plugin is one that comes to mind with mu.

Work around is to upload an image first via the Write Posts page to
get the '1' subdirectory created first.

Please see if that helps,

While I see the reason for this, I'm concerned about being able to
drop buddypress into already existing mu installs.  I know one on
install that I host, there's a great deal of users who have access to
multiple blogs as either admins or authors.  Have to admit that this
will be a show stopper for us and I think a number of other folks.
I'm rather surprised no one else has spoken up about this.

Will there be any attempt to allow multiple blogs where they already exist?

Thanks,

I've been chatting with Chris a lot about exactly this. I'm going to  
spend the
next couple of days and see if it is feasible to support multiple  
blogs right now.

We had two ideas, one fairly easy, one much harder:

1. Make use of the existing blog switcher. Make sure that the primary  
blog ID
is tracked so that BuddyPress components only appear on the user's own  
admin
area. Other blogs the user has access to would just contain the  
necessary blog
tabs.

2. Provide a blog switcher via the blog tab. When a user clicks on the  
blog tab
they are presented with a list of the blogs they belong to. They can  
select one
and then continue to carry out actions for that blog. Users with just  
one blog
would never see this. Right now, I'm not sure this is even possible  
within a
plugin. It would however mean you'd never have to leave your own  
personal admin
area.

I'll keep everyone updated on how this progresses.

Just to echo what Andy said, this is a tricky area for BuddyPress
which is user-based rather than blog-based. Short of a major overhaul
to the whole admin area we're batting on a sticky wicket, as us Brits
sometimes say.

Forgive my ignorance if this is something that has already been
addressed, as I just joined this mailing list yesterday.

I would very much hope that people could have more than one blog, as I
think having the capability of group specific blogs would be a good
idea.

When I was confronted with a similar problem as this with a WPMU
installation, I divided all of the admin tasks/tabs that I had added
or needed to add into two categories, current_user-specific or
blog-specific.  This allowed the current_user-specific tasks to be
consistently located in the backend of every blog the current_user had
rights on.  If the current_user tried to visit the admin section of a
site to which they didn't have rights, they would be bounced to their
primary_blog/source_domain's admin area.

Hi Isaac,

It sounds like we're tackling the same problems here. Your solution is
certainly one we're considering (in fact it's pretty much what I've
done on myJournal.com as well) but because we want BuddyPress to be
insanely easy to use we felt there may be a better way than throwing
people to a whole different admin area when they want to write on a
new blog.

Good to have you aboard.

Chris

requires the latest versiuon of MU - the WP2.5 version. All the

BuddyPress will no longer work with 1.3.3 or below. You will need to  
upgrade to the latest trunk or official release when available.

Could anyone tell me why the focus on dumbing down? I'm concerned, now that
I've been testing Andrea's install, that it's going to change WPMU and the
general WP interface so much it will alienate existing WP users. I was kinda
hoping BuddyPress was going to be a SN add-on to the functionality of WP,
not changing it completely and making for a generic product that will
require a huge amount of backend work to re-enable many of the WP features,
which kinda defeats the point for my purposes, and from the sounds of it,
the purposes of many.

With the digests it is a little hard to reply to specific threads, but
I wanted to say that if we could have buddypress (work around) the
installs with multiple blogs per user, that would be the best for me!
! !  Even if the design allows a quick plugin for those of us with
multiple blogs per user :)

That would be much appreciated!

Thanks,

Trent

Hi Cass,

We understand your concerns and we don't intend to alienate anyone.
BuddyPress is still at a very early stage, so we've disabled a lot of
things that eventually be back.

Cass, we won't be modifying the interface massively. Both the design  
tab and settings tab have been re-enabled and all we've done is merge  
the manage and write tabs into one blog tab.

Once we're closer to the finish line, there should be no WPMU features  
that you can't access in BuddyPress.

These errors are all because of signups before I made the updates.  
I've gone in and deleted everyones account and added new profile  
fields. Unfortunately this means you will have to sign up again, but  
it will stop these errors occurring due to earlier code.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Extended Profiles in "Your Profile"
Message-ID: <BLU143-W18E62CC42D373196FA3D26EAEC0@phx.gbl>


Hi,

Why do we get a new menu for the Buddypress profiles and are the groups that we add not added to the default "My Profile" page of Wordpress ?

Can we easily change this that someone knows ? I was not able to find that out yet, but I think it's a nicer solution.

Maybe we also can make a "disable" default fileds there into this plugin, saves us from using another one for this.

Phew! That's a relief :) Sorry for assuming it would stay so
stripped-down. Looking forward to more testing!

The first time I installed BuddyPress on a clean install of MU 1.3.3 
(BuddyPress revision 11), I deleted the line that changed the memory 
limit and it ran fine.  Now, after updating to MU trunk and BuddyPress 
revision 22.  Now, my admin panel will not load at all.  I've put my PHP

You will need to upgrade to the latest trunk of Wordpress MU with the  
new admin interface. BuddyPress will no longer work on installations  
of 1.3.3 or earlier. An official MU release should be available next  
week.

Hey Guys,

We have started making this plugin. Currently it only works on WordPress 
but I'm keen to know whether or not we should integrate it with 
BuddyPress and WordPress MU properly.

I'm bringing this up here now because I don't want to do it if Andy 
already has already started making another version of Status Updates.

I kinda hope not because I think it is another nice and manageable way 
for me to contribute to my favorite blogging platform :))

Ciao,

Dan

Hi

We currently don't have a status plugin, so that would be great. The
best thing would be to make sure it fits with the rest of the
BuddyPress plugins. Let us know if it works.

My mistake. Looks like permission errors? From what I can see it looks  
as though you don't have read permissions set on those files.

Ben, try going to the properties of the folder you're having trouble
with and checking the permissions for the iusr_[machinename] user.
That's the default internet user in Windows.

There is currently no easy way to "svn up" the BuddyPress trunk.  Can I 
make a mu plugin that simply includes the files from buddypress and put 
buddypress in its own folder?

I've figured out the problem.  I had been updating using cygwin's 
ability to use shell scripts.  Cygwin somehow changed the permissions 
since I was directly overwriting the files instead of using svn.  I've 
updated my shell script and now it uses svn directly.

Actually there's no reason most of the plugins shouldn't work in regular WP.

I would recommend just a WP install with a set of pages. The new 
revisions stuff in 2.6 will help a lot. Mediawiki has been a pain to 
integrate on the WP.org side since we started using it.

Message-ID: <480319A7.1010609@tomato.it>

Hello.

I discovered yesterday BuddyPress.

I've to say that I'm a great fan of WP and I've developed many blog/site
with it and I wrote many plugins.

BuddyPress sounds great. we are about starting a new project where all
these social network stuff are required so we are considering using
BuddyPress for it.

I've just got a couple of questions:

1) Is there a forum in BuddyPress ? I can't see this feature listed on
the website.

2) Are there already website (production) that are using this buddypress ?

Thanks !

Last night I checked in revision 28 of BuddyPress. This version is now  
running on http://testdrivewpmu.com for  those who want to give it a  
run through.

Revisions include:

- Multiple blog support: members of your network can now sign up and  
run more than one blog. Their primary account is used as their 'home'  
where they can manage their friends/groups/messages etc. Other blogs  
just contain the normal WordPress blogging features. Their home  
account stays as the first tab in their admin interface and is marked  
with a user icon.

- New 'Blog' tab with no loss of WPMU features. I've completely  
revised the blog tab and simply bumped down all blog related tabs one  
level. This means all features found in WPMU are accessible and have  
not been renamed or moved.

- Site admin settings for BuddyPress have been moved under the 'Site  
Admin' tab. There was no point in creating another site administration  
tab.

- Member level settings for components have been introduced and blog  
settings have been dropped down one level to "Settings>Blog".

- I've introduced two site administration settings for BuddyPress  
under "Site Admin>BuddyPress". The first lets you completely turn off  
the 'Blog' tab and stick with the default WPMU tab layout. The second  
lets you disable the 'Design' tab site wide for all members (other  
than site admins).

Next Steps:

My next steps are to go through the code at this stage and bring it  
into line with the Wordpress Coding Standards, to keep things  
consistent. This will mean a change in filenames, if you are keeping  
up to date using SVN then this shouldn't cause a problem.

Where I say 'primary account' I mean 'primary blog' which in WPMU is  
the first blog they signed up for.

I'm also a bit confused about why other people's email addresses are
appearing on "my" site.  To remain similar to stock WPMU, I think the
Authors & Users should only list people who have a role on that
particular site. Instead of having a global directory on "my" site,
perhaps a search feature similar to the friend finder should be
incorporated if I want to

As I haven't really had time to examine the buddypress code in depth
yet, if for some reason everyone who joins a buddypress powered site
is automatically being assigned a capability on all of the underlying
blogs, the usermeta table is going to grow exponentially in size as
new people sign up, negatively impacting mysql inserts and updates as
this table has three indexes to maintain.

Then again, the WP/WPMU database schema could use many many
normalization & efficiency improvements anyway, but that is outside
the scope of buddypress.

Wow, great changes!  I'm thrilled that you're going with the simple use the
first blog as the main one for buddypress user stuff. (at least for now).

I'm also glad you've rearranged the menus. What you just described makes
much more sense than the previous layout.

With the 2.5 codebase, the thumbnail filenames have changed. This  
means any accounts you created before you upgraded to the 2.5 code  
base are looking for a thumbnail with the old filename structure. Your  
best bet is to remove old accounts and recreate them.

This should not be happening, I'm investigating this.

Hi Matt,

Actually, I'm not sure you're right. While most of the BP features can
be used between multiple users irrespective of whether they have blogs
or not (i.e. multiple users in a normal WP installation) they'd only
make sense if the users have a separate public profiles.

Here's an example using the friends feature. In an MU install we'd
have user1.domain.com and user2.domain.com, and we'd be able to tell
they were friends as it would say so on their profiles. In a normal WP
install there would just be one address for the blog, so nowhere to
say multiple people are friends. That could be done within the admin
area, but to me that misses the point somewhat.

Plus the features as they stand need the site admin section to be
configured (although that could be changed, of course).

Of course there could be certain features of BP that could be used in
a standalone version of Wordpress, but that would need a little more
thought.

There seems to be some overlap between the BuddyPress profile pictures and
Automattic's Gravatars, are there any plans to integrate the two systems in
the future? Perhaps by being to upload directly to your Gravatar account
from within the BuddyPress interface? This would be possible if Gravatars
had the necessary APIs.

Cheers - Stuart.

Hi Stuart,

As far as I'm aware Andy is looking at that as a possibility,
especially as Automattic now own Gravatar. It would also help with the
cross-site sharing of information we're currently discussing.

If public API's for Gravatar become available then this is a definite  
possibility.

This was a bug in the latest trunk of WPMU, I've upgraded http://testdrivewpmu.com 
  to the latest trunk that includes the fix.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Privacy component
Message-ID: <1dae0d150804141639n36fed6b7l27ec54ad3bb59013@mail.gmail.com>

I guess this is mostly for Andy and/or Matt...

I would like to contribute to buddypress by creating a privacy
component which would allow people to set content to only be viewable
by certain other people.  While WP is a very open platform and is
great for sharing all its content, "social networks" usually allow
their users to set up their own walled gardens based on who is defined
as a friend, friend of a friend, being a part of a group, etc. If this
is something that would be appropriate for BP, I have a couple of
questions:

1. How fine-grained should the privacy options be?  Since it seems I
read something every week or so about some social network offering
more fine-grained control over privacy options (to be fair, it is
usually Facebook making an about-face after changing something
private-by-default to public-by-default and recoiling from user
backlash), this seems like a good place to consider both the existing
BP framework and potential future BP enhancements. As an example,
while I've never looked at XFN in depth, will XFN potentially be used
as a basis for determining BP friendships?  To start off with, I think
the following non-mutually-exclusive options should be available as
they correspond with what I hopefully understand BP's capabilities:
a) Public
b) Logged in WPMU users
c) Logged in friends
d) Members of specified groups
e) Nobody (really only the content creator, but "nobody" is probably
less confusing to most end users)

Potentially a f) friends of friends - kind of a sql nightmare in
having to join the bp_friends table several times to itself to search
for permutations of initiator_user_id and friend_user_id.

2. What existing and potentially future planned types of content can
be privatized?  Items in the posts tables seem like a no-brainer.
Either extended individual profile pieces of data or possibly entire
extended profile groups seem like they should also allow to be
privatized, as this would allow for someone to set something like a
phone number or the "contact" group to only be viewable by friends
instead of people intentionally leaving some fields blank (phone
number, email & home addresses, etc.) to prevent identity theft or
potential harassment. (As changing profile privacy settings should be
on the same admin page as changing the actual profile data, the
xprofile_edit function would have to be altered to support this.)

3. Answers to the above questions will go along way in determining the
best methods for storing/accessing privacy data, but do you have a
preferred method of storing this data?  The seemingly normal WP method
would be to store it as a serialized array, and that can be easily
done by adding a "restricted_to" or similarly named field to each
table that contains something to be privatized (this wouldn't
currently work on allowing bp_groups privacy settings on a user by
user basis).  Another method that wouldn't alter the existing WPMU
schema would be to use a bp_privacy table, and while this makes
intercepting, parsing and altering sql queries potentially more
troublesome, it does have the advantage of allowing setting
permissions on arbitrary data that doesn't neatly correspond to
setting row level security on existing data such as user_email from
wp_users or other non-extended profile data in wp_usermeta.

Even if being able to privatize content such as posts, pages, links,
etc. doesn't seem all that important, I really think end users will
appreciate being able to change the privacy settings of their profile
data.  From writing a fairly similar WPMU extended profile component,
the only real changes that are necessary to allow "simple" profile
privacy are:
a) Add a "restricted to" field to bp_xprofile_data, allowing options
a,b,c,e from question 1 above as either enums, integers, or bits (bits
are better if you want to later add options that are not subsets of
one another and hence mutually exclusive).
b) Change the xprofile_edit function to allow changing/saving the
privacy options.
c) Change the profile display code to honor the privacy settings.

(This simple approach leaves a user's email address or other
wp_usermeta data in limbo as far as profile data is concerned.)

Unfortunately, I can't share the profile component I wrote as it is
contains a lot of proprietary code, and I'm not sure how useful it
would be anyway as it has to piece together profile components and
their permissions from several MS SQL tables.  I ended up using a
combination of permission bits in my profile data table and a separate
profile permissions table to track the fields of the other MS SQL
tables containing separate profile data (mostly pre-WPMU associated
member and demographic information) along with wp_users->user_email.

Isaac Chapman

P.S. It might be worth adding an sort_order type of field to the
profile tables so the rows will be displayed in a consistent,
definable order that isn't dependent on the order the fields were
inserted.

I like this idea of being able to have levels of friends and certain posts
are viewable by those people.

Actually there's a plugin for MU that takes care of most of this -
http://wpmudev.org/project/More-Privacy-Options

in addition to the default option (allow search engines and public 
listing or not allow them), it adds the following:
1. Blog visible to any logged in community member.
2. Blog visible only to registered users of blog.
 3. Blog visible only to administrators.

That help? :D

That's a good start ... but would it handle different level's of friends.
Maybe it could be expanded.

I've already had the fun of setting up a WPMU site that enforces blog
level security on those criteria along with group membership, but I
think it would be a disservice to a "social network" such as BP to
require end users to setup and maintain multiple blogs if they want to
have different privacy settings.

I'm interested in seeing BuddyPress features work (at least on some  
level) with non-MU WordPress blogs.  Mostly because I don't think the  
intercommunication features should be limited to BuddyPress  
internally, I'd love to see it talk with other social containers (for  
lack of a better term).  So my plain WordPress blog should (in my  
version of the future) should be able to talk to other WordPress  
blogs, LinkedIn, Facebook, WordPress-MU+BuddyPress, etc.

To sum up, I shouldn't have to install WPMU in order to get those  
features.

Now that said, perhaps BuddyPress isn't the best place to be  
developing these features.  Perhaps a BuddyPress Jr. plugin for non- 
MU blogs.

Would it require multiple blogs to do this, or on a post by post basis?

I guess a better demonstration of privacy settings would be a stripped
down and modified version of an extended profile page from one of my
wpmu sites, which I've attached.

I was initially trying to propose a single privacy framework that
could be added to a base BP installation which could potentially cover
any arbitrary content, but at this point I think the profile component
should have its own distinct privacy framework built in.  As profile
data is user based, it could be displayed on a user's base/initial BP
blog, additional blogs the user has created, or even on group blogs,
and I think the user's profile privacy settings should be enforced
across all of these potential blogs.

I still think it is worthwhile to create an add-on BP component that
could secure/privatize content on a Post, Page, and potentially Link
level basis. Something like the attached mock up for Posts and Pages.

I have a question. I am in contact with a developer out of Italy who has
developed a single one way sign on script for joomla to wordpress mu that
works fantastic out of the box. This would be a killer integration
opportunity for everyone involved.

I am also developing a web site with wordpress mu right now and would be
willing to open up my project to a few of you to kick around and test out
your scripts on my alpha web site or on another version of this alpha web
site to experiment with. In other words, I have a shared hosting account
with a static IP and i am willing to let you guys develop on it in the
spirit of open source to test out our applications and to see what we can do
to further bond the two platforms closer together. I would only do this with
someone who was actually on the buddy press team because of the security
risks.  I hope that I haven't committed heresy but a buddy press wordpress
mu integration would seriously blow out the stupid 3rd party outsourced
white label applications and give more freedom to people that wanted to grow
their own targeted social networking communities because joomla has several
scripts for video and audio sharing.

Regards,

Jason Spencer

Andrea, that's a useful plugin but what Isaac has suggested is a much
more comprehensive system. I think people will want to restrict more
than just their posts.

Isaac, that sounds great. We're currently looking at the possibility
of tagging friends, which complicates ny privacy code but gives
unlimited control to the user.

A blanket security setting like that is a bit heavyhanded and not
really helpful for SN purposes. At the very least a profile page
should be able to be visible publicly separate from other content, so
a user is findable if they wish to be.

How would the UI work for tagging and groups? I'm visualising public
profile pages with an "add me" link which does the basic friends level
tagging, which would then go to a page with a set of options for
adding new friend to various different user-defined groups [maybe
something ajaxy/dragndrop/visual?]. The same groups list [including
public, basic WPMU logged in, basic friend, user-defined groups,
private] would be available as a module [checklist?] on the post
writing page, the link/blogroll add page and anywhere else that
content might be drafted [possibly the profile page and/or elements of
it for starters].  Is that kinda what's being considered here or am I
totally off-base?

Ya, I was kind of thinking of something along the same lines.  There would
be an area where you can make "friend levels" ... or maybe those are
predefined to only include {x} number of levels.  Who knows.  But then on
the writing page, there could be another module just like the category
module.  Maybe either radio buttons, then they select the lowest group they
want to see the post, and everyone in a group higher than that can see it
... or check boxes and they have to select all of the groups they want to
see the post.

I'd be interested in seeing a plugin or setup of plugins that enabled
distributed social networking features.  It would be cool if I could
keep my friends list on my blog, express those relationships (and
distribute the relationships via xfn) then use that list to determine
who can see what posts.  There is another post on this list discussing
a 'Privacy component' that discusses how to deal with security across
the network and how to manage which of your friends gets to view what
information.  For example, if my wife wants to rant about her mother
in law she might want her friends to see it but would rather my mother
not be able to view that post.  There was another post describing a
status component.  I would love to see something like friendfeed built
in where you pull your own digital identity into your blog and that is
then distributed out to people on your friend list.  You could use
your relationships to control which information is distributed to who.
 It would be great if there were widgets or some other simple way to
display that information on your blog.

I am not sure if Matt and Andy would want to sanction such a project
with Wordpress's blessing, but that would bring the community together
under one project.  I know that Andy is very busy with BuddyPress and
doesn't really have time to take on another project.  It seems like
there are a lot of willing contributors and this could be a very cool
addition to an already great platform.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Still Having Problems With Profile Pictures
Message-ID: <20080415120319.5mt77458lco0w48o@www.dimensionmedia.com>

This is getting quite frustrating. This *IS* something that's  
confirmed working right?

I grabbed the newest version of MU (WP2.5) and BuddyPress (this  
morning). Fresh install on new server. Logged into my admin account  
and attempted to upload a profile picture. Got this error message:

"Unable to create directory  
/var/www/vhosts/dimensionsites.com/httpdocs/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/. Is  
its parent directory writable by the server?"

I next made sure blogs.dir was chmod 777. Also I changed the  
directory's owner from apache to dimensionsites (the owner of all the  
other folders). Still same error message.

I next tried to upload a pic via Write Posts. Still same error message.

I then created a folder called 'files', chmod 777. When I did this,  
Upload A Pic via Write Posts worked. But when I attempted to upload a  
profile pic, the results page DIES right after displaying the submenu  
(tried this in multiple browsers).

I'm stumped at this point. Happy to give complete access to the test  
site to anyone. Thanks.

Hi,

Well, my initial thought was that people generally don't have a
well-defined map in their heads of where their friends are on a scale
of privacy. OK, geeks do. But normal people may want to be able to
just out their friends into arbitrary containers, without a
pre-defined hierarchy. Tagging is perfect for this.

On Tue, Apr 15, 2008 at 8:37 AM, Cass Edwards wrote:
> How would the UI work for tagging and groups?

Basically there would be a set of default tags which are created when
BP is installed. Things like "Friend", "Family" etc. These will be
selectable using checkboxes when a friend is being added/edited. New
tags will can also be entered in a textbox (comma-separated, like post
tags). New tags entered by the users will subsequently appear next to
the default tags with checkboxes.

As long as the user keeps to less than approximately 20 distinct tags
this will be fine. Any more than that and maybe a multi-select box
would be better. So a user will effectively create their own groups of
friends by the tags they assign. And, of course, a single friend might
have multiple tags and crossover several groups. The queries to check
all this might and up a little bit complex, but hopefully to the user
it will be pretty obvious what to do.

I'm currently building this into myJournal and hope to be testing it
tomorrow or Thursday.

Of course, there's very probably a better way. So, any thoughts?

Tags would work too.  Its just a matter of being able to link a friend
("user") to that tag or group.  Then having those posts visible or not based
upon whether or not you are in that group.

Another thing to think about as well would be the RSS feed.  How is the RSS
feed to know who you are and if you are in that friends list.  I guess just
not showing any posts with a "friend level criteria" would be a way to go.

It would be great if there was some way to authenticate feeds so that
I could see the posts my friend intends for me.  A first pass might
prevent anything other than public content from making it into the RSS
feed, but later iterations should use some type of authentication
scheme.

Yep, authentication in feeds is a problem. I got around this two ways:

1) Don't show feeds for private stuff (yes, a cop-out)

2) Show feeds for public stuff, even if it is filtered for a
particular user. For example in myJournal.com we have a recent
activity feature which publishes an RSS feed. In many sites this
information is private, with no feed. However it's all public stuff -
who's added a picture, a post etc (we currently don't have per-item
privacy settings) - so it's OK to give a public feed of it as it's all
shown publically anyway.

If anyone knows of a way to authenticate RSS feeds to ensure privacy
then that would be great. Remember it has to work with all current RSS
applications (Google Reader, Bloglines, Outlook, Thunderbird etc etc).
It's a tough one.

RSS doesn't really support authentication in a standardized way across
applications.  For all intents and purposes I would think the
necessary filters ('posts_where' or 'query' if joining another table
is required) would simply assume that any RSS requested content would
be anonymous as the $current_user could not be set, and only return
completely public content.

>From my recollection Atom feeds do support a consistent authentication
mechanism, but it would be up to the user to enter their credentials
in whatever client application/reader they were using.  As I doubt
many people would do that, it would only show public content
most of the time.

I think you are correct, but I think that the problem is important
enough to solve.  One solution might be to use obscurity - append
random tokens to the feed.  We aren't moving financial data around so
it might be good enough.  Of course this isn't great .  Maybe HTTP
Authentication could solve the problem?

As Isaac says, there isn't a universally-supported authentication  
mechanism for RSS/Atom feeds right now. Sad but true. TI wrote  
feedblendr.com and looked into it in depth and was frustrated to find  
nothing was supported across the board enough to bother with.  
Unfortunately it's not truly "solvable" right now, by us (/ 
BuddyPress), since obviously it'd require other clients to support it  
etc.

I've seen HTTP Basic, WSSE and obscurity-based authentication schemes  
in use mostly, and of those, obscurity (as you described Justin) was  
the simplest, most effective method. Obviously it's not super-secure,  
and if you use that, then you need a way to be able to "re-obscure"  
your URL as well in case it gets distributed somehow. HTTP Basic has  
*some* support in feed readers, more-so than WSSE.

HTH,

Beau

Contribution is encouraged, so thanks for putting yourself forward. I  
know that Justin Ball is also interested in contributing in this area,  
so lets see how we can put our collective heads together on this one.  
I'll be in IRC all day tomorrow - #buddypress on Freenode. Lets  
discuss how we can get this component moving forward.

I'd like to see fine grained privacy as it gives the user the greatest  
level of control. However, I saw a talk by Chris Messina here at the  
Open Web Vancouver conference today. He mentioned only 25% of Facebook  
users have ever looked the privacy options page. As much as giving  
users fine control over their privacy, it also needs to be simple,  
otherwise people won't understand and/or use it.

I like the idea of tagging, and then giving the option to apply  
privacy settings to those tags. This allows you to be as fine grained  
with privacy as you want. These tags could be applied to friendships,  
blog posts, photos etc. Using XFN is an option and perhaps using XFN  
defined relationships as pre-defined tags? Currently I don't  
understand this area well enough either, however.

We could also provide generic options such as you mentioned, "Public",  
"Only My Friends", "Logged in Users" for those members who aren't  
concerned with fine grained control.

Just off the top of my head:

Profile data, profile data groups, blog posts, pages, links, photos,  
albums, wire posts, status updates, groups joined...

This should be discussed. How does the existing privacy plugin that  
Andrea mentioned work?

Agreed, I'll add this in.

I try to hang out in the IRC channel during the day.  I think that
going forward this is an important piece so let's chat more on how to
implement the ideas.

I had it in my head that all privacy controls would be handled through  
one *required* BuddyPress privacy component.

Based on using tags to define privacy levels on any content, I don't  
see what we can't make this happen? We can carry across these privacy  
settings on all blogs the user owns / can post on.

This is very similar to what I had in my head, where "BP Dev Group" or  
"Example Group" are tags with defined privacy settings. If a user is  
not interested in fine grained privacy control, they can just select  
"Public" or "Only My Friends".

Also can't join groups [though can create them] or get friends list,
but have been assuming all of these things are still being worked on.
Can send IM's though!

I don't think the lowest / highest level is the best idea, some content, like pictures would need varying levels. You may want to share your graduation photos with the public, your baby shower pics with friends and family, your bachelor party with friends only (and maybe just your male friends), yet you may want to share your bagpipe playing pics with family and members of the kilt club, but not let friends see those... multiple tags or radio buttons to select and deselect would be important to users.

Of course the same could be true for posts, pages, lists (books, etc), videos, etc.

a "who can see this" tab would be a nice feature - helpful and a way to update that for each piece of content. Isn't there a way to invite only select friends to view myspace blog posts?

Did you document how mediawiki was integrated?  I've been wanting to add a
wiki to a mu site and haven't been able to figure it out.

A wiki would go well with a community using Buddypress.

As a little aside, is there a plugin that will allow WP to act as a
wiki? That seems quite easy, but i may be missing the obvious.

Hi,

A few days ago I said I was working on adding tagging to my friends
plugin for myJournal. It's done and working nicely, and after a good
conversation with a few people in IRC (room #buddypress on freenode;
come on in, the water's fine) it looks like this could form part of a
powerful global privacy framework. I did a screenshot of what I've
been working on which I hope will help to clarify what I meant. See it
here: http://www.stillbreathing.co.uk/images/misc/friend-tags.jpg

This shows a number of things. Firstly wherever it says "Contacts"
read "Friends", for myJournal those kind of words are configurable by
the site admin. You can see a list of "Groups", which is our name for
friend tags. Selecting one of these gives you just the people with
that tag (it's only single tag selection at the moment). You can also
see some pagination, the there's the details for the first friend.

Below the name and description for the friend you can see a list of
checkboxes with tag names. The first few (Family -> Supplier) are
pre-configured by the site admin. Really the "Friend" tag is redundant
because everyone in this list is a friend regardless of what other
tags they may have.

To assign tags to the friend select the checkboxes you want. You can
also enter a comma-separated list of new tags into the textbox. When
you add new tags it assigns those new tags to the current friend
automatically, and also adds those new tags as checkbox options for
all other friends. Tags you add are just for you, no-one else can see
them. If you remove one of your own tags from all your friends that
tag wil disappear from the checkbox list.

A couple of things could make this better. Firstly for long lists of
tags there will lots of checkboxes - imagine 30 checkboxes repeated
for every friend down the page. Nasty. Secondly it would be nice to
assign tags to multiple people and save them all in one go; at the
moment you have to save each friends tags individually. But that's not
a massive job to change.

Any comments?

Chris

I'm reviewing David's setup this morning and will hopefully put an end  
to these permission errors. I believe Cass' errors below were because  
the 'no avatar' image was deleted. I'm going to disable this  
functionality.

Hi Jason. Thanks for letting us know about this. Although direct  
integration between Joomla and Wordpress MU would be great, I would  
personally prefer to take an open approach. By using standards like  
OpenID we can allow multiple applications to be accessed by using a  
single login identity. That way we don't have to write custom code to  
support the wide array of applications people use in their day-to-day  
lives. What are people's opinions on this?

Thanks,
Andy

What you described is essentially the DiSo project. The DiSo project  
and BuddyPress are definitely not the same thing in respect to goals,  
but BuddyPress can help the project by supporting its direction and  
defined standards.

Ideally, I'd like a single Wordpress blog with the DiSo plugins  
installed to be able to interface with a BuddyPress installation to  
its full potential.

For those who haven't, I recommend taking a look at Chris Messina's  
slides from Open Web Vancouver last week: http://www.slideshare.net/factoryjoe/diso-the-open-web/

Open ID is great if it can truly be integrated with each system. Does open
Id let ad admin or post writer log in to Wordpress? I thought that the
OpenID plugin was just for comments plus we'd need it for BBpress.

As far as the wiki conversation goes. We need a way to link between posts
without plugins since plugins break.

Hi Jason. Thanks for letting us know about this. Although direct  
integration between Joomla and Wordpress MU would be great, I would  
personally prefer to take an open approach. By using standards like  
OpenID we can allow multiple applications to be accessed by using a  
single login identity. That way we don't have to write custom code to  
support the wide array of applications people use in their day-to-day  
lives. What are people's opinions on this?

Thanks,
Andy

I am an OpenID advocate.  I would love for my users to be able to
login to any of the systems using a single sign on.  However, having
said that OpenID is still a hard concept for every day users to grok.
I used it in a couple of my applications and watched as my users tried
to login with their username instead of their OpenID url.  Using a url
as a username is still a tough concept to understand.  We might be
able to overcome this problem if Wordpress MU could be an OpenID
provider.  Then you could let users login with just a username and
assume the domain part is the domain in use on the website.  Users
that already have an OpenID would be savy enough to login with their
existing account.  One nice trick would be to integrate various
applications - Wordpress, Joomla, Media Wiki, etc - so that you if you
sign into one via OpenID or other method you are logged into all of
them.  It can become tedious and confusing to a user to have to keep
logging in all the time.

bbPress can share authentication cookies with WordPressMU, so there is  
no need for an OpenID plugin for bbPress. You would just need a plugin  
that pointed all login links to the WordPress login page. Pretty  
trivial stuff.

In cases where that wasn't possible I'm sure that porting any OpenID  
plugin for WordPress (2.5) that is out there over to bbPress (0.9)  
would be pretty painless.

That is a good point.  We are running BuddyPress alongside WPMU, but
we are also using MediaWiki and Plone.  We have managed to get both of
those systems to use the WPMU user accounts for login, but it would be
nice if the user didn't have to login again when they want to do
something in Plone or in MediaWiki.  I think that over time the
integration of these platforms will become more and more important.
It would be nice to have an easy way to manage user accounts across
all these systems - OpenID or otherwise.

Hi Guys,

We are planning another buddypress plugin. What I'm after is feedback 
and people willing to help. We're pretty busy but we intend to start 
working on this very soon.

My idea is based around my concept of buddymoney - or wordpress tokens.

Buddymoney is an online currency. People will buy buddymoney that can be 
spent on any wordpress site that uses the buddyplace market plugin.

Buddyplace is an open source WP e-Commerce module that will accepts 
these tokens as an alternative to real money. This will be useful for 
people without credit cards or who want to make many micro payments 
across many sites.

We're looking for people that want to help us with this. Its going to be 
a big job but its going to be a fun one.

Ciao,

Dan

Subject: [buddypress-dev] introducing my project
Message-ID: <32c7967e0804230802y608b7c71h332391c93f81205f@mail.gmail.com>

Id like to introducing this project Im starting to work on cause I though
that maybe it has something to do with buddypress...

Its a republisher plugin, that allows a blog owner of wordpressMU to
republish content from others blog in the community in his/hers own blog.

It will work in three different ways:

1. A republishing interface in the admin area, inpired by reblog (
www.reblog.org), where the user will choose wich blogs he wants to follow
and then have a list of the latest unread posts so he/she can republish it.

This other 2 ways are rather for a community where there is a "main" blog or
something.

2. With a plugin installed in each blog the user wants to republish in his
own - everytime he is visiting the blogs from the community there will be a
button in each post so he can republish the article right from there

3. Colaborative Republish. This also requires a plugin to be installed in
each participant blog. A button will appear for each post so any logged user
will be able to vote in each article he thinks should be republished in the
main blog. After the post reaches a number of votes set by the admin, its
automatically republished.


I also want to extend the funcionality of item 1 to RSS feeds, so it would
not be a plugin only for wordpressMU. But this is not in the main roadmap
for now...

well thats it... if you have any insights it would be great, And if you
thinf this could share somehow some funcionality of a buddypress plugin let
me know. At least so I can make it in a way it will "compatible"...

cheers

Leo,,

ps - if you have any idea for a name I would also apreciate...
