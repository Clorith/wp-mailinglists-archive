Subject: [buddypress-dev] BuddyPress Status
Message-ID: <b63307a70805012242p4ed6c04fqe8eb0a41bc6509c1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there everyone, I am not sure if this will work, anyway I am a student
from the university of Sydney, me and my colleague is currently doing a
independant project based on PHP, due to our time constraints, we started
searching for existing platforms to work on and buddypress seems to be a
very nice candidate. So my question here is:

1) What is the current project status? Is the one listed on
trac.buddypress.org up to date?
2) Which functionalities is currently working or almost working?
3) With around Intermediate knowledge of PHP, how hard would it be to take
up Word Press and BuddyPress and begin work on it? Will we need to spend
alot of time getting acquainted with WordPress first?

Thanks guys, looking forward to your replies.

William

The current project status is that BuddyPress is in heavy development  
mode right now. I've recently updated the project status in Trac.

Extended profiles and messaging are the two components that we have  
completed major work on, these should be functioning well but haven't  
been tested heavily yet. The groups component is quite far along, but  
still lacks templating ability to display groups to the user.

You'd need fairly good knowledge of how Wordpress works to really  
understand what is going on. However, what you need to know is all in  
the Wordpress Codex (codex.wordpress.org) so you can always use that  
as a reference. The best way to learn is to get in there and see what  
is going on.

Good luck!
Andy

Message-ID: <69934088-BC79-4A4B-A083-4CFEFD93A961@automattic.com>

Hi All,

Some project status updates:

---------

* New avatar functionality has been added to BuddyPress courtesy of  
code provided by Beau Lebens. Profile avatars can now be cropped to  
two different sizes.

* The extended profile component is now closing in on being feature  
complete. Justin Ball and Trenton Cameron are working on some  
additional features as outlined inhttp://trac.buddypress.org/ticket/12

* The extended profile component now includes fully functional  
template tags. This means profile data can be rendered easily in  
existing themes.

* The messaging component has been completely re-written. Messages are  
now threaded and viewed in a conversational style. The component now  
makes use of the included Wordpress AJAX hooks for inline replying to  
messages.

* Beau is working on "to:" field AJAX autocompletion that will  
autocomplete both friend names and group names.

* After a lengthy discussion in #buddypress on IRC, I am putting  
together a development roadmap this week. This will outline the  
functionality we want completed for each tagged release. I will be  
adding this to trac. I have just today tagged version 0.1 at:http://svn.buddypress.org/tags/

* The groups component is being worked on by Chris Taylor when he has  
spare time. He has done a great job integrating his work with the  
BuddyPress environment so far. The next step with this component is to  
create custom template tags so that groups can be rendered within  
themes. Once I have completed my work on the messaging component I  
will be helping Chris with this.

----------

I will be emailing the list once the roadmap is complete. This should  
give people a solid idea on feature breakdown, direction and the  
current status of our push towards 1.0. If there are any developers  
out there who would like to give some of their time to the project,  
please feel free to email me at anytime (or drop into #buddypress on  
freenode).

As always, bugs can be reported at: http://trac.buddypress.org/ 
newticket (login with your WP.org support forum credentials).

Thanks!
Andy

Sorry, you might have gone over this before, but does this mean the
Buddypress specific theme will become redundant and that we will be
able to use any theme with tags thats WORDPRESS MU  friendly?
(assuming we integrated the tags)

We'll provide a default theme that includes all the template tags in  
the correct places. However, yes, you can use the template tags to  
provide BuddyPress functionality within your existing WordPress theme.

I would like to thank everyone working here, it is a wonderful project and I
believe there is a wonderful team behind it as well, I appreciate your job
very much!

I just had a try on the lastest trunk, I found it messed up all category,
archieve and page link of my wpmu site, these links all do not work, I just
wonder does buddypress support wpmu subdirectory installation? furthermore,
the avatar upload does not work either, unless I changed the submit url of
the form in bp-xprofile-avatars.php, I suppose it is the same problem if
current buddypress build is only designed for subdomian installation.

btw, how to change the Encoding to UTF-8? my wpmu site is UTF-8, but
buddypress on my site still can not display Chinese correctly.

Is there anybody have any idea about my problems? any clues? thanks very
much!

Hi,

I've used this system on myJournal.com and it's pretty good, although
you have to be careful as it can bring back a LOT of contacts, not all
of them valid email addresses. It is a good way to grow a social
networking site, but some may see it as a way to allow people to spam
their friends.

Chris

Another option (if we want to use something like this) is to use the  
RapLeaf API (http://www.rapleaf.com/apidoc/v2/abook).

I used it on MyBabyOurBaby and it's pretty cool and very easy to use  
although it does require an API key from RapLeaf.

Just a thought

First I would like to thank everyone working on this project,  I appreciate
your job very much!

I planned to integrate xprofile and messages with my wpmu site as the first
stage, but I got some problems:

1. xprofile messed up all category, archive, page and more other links on my
wpmu site, did it change the link structure of wpmu?

2. thee avatar uploading, it only works on main blog, for other blogs, you
need change the submit url of the form in bp-xprofile-avatars.php to make it
work, my wpmu site is installed in subdirectory mode, is that a problem? is
the current buddypress build only designed for subdomain mode?

3. buddypress does not using UTF-8 Encoding which I set on my wpmu site, how
do I resolve it?

thanks a lot!

Hi,

first of all: Thanks for all the great work done so far.

I've been lurking around here for a while, until now only reading.

I'm currently in the process of implementing a WPMU/Buddypress site  
which needs privacy based on tags similar to the one described by  
Chris Taylor.

I have read the roadmap which says "privacy privacy privacy" in core.  
Is this a subject somebody is already working on actively? Or is  
there already a plugin or something?

@Chris Taylor: Is your privacy concept something which you want to be  
added to BP as open source? Or is it specific to your site?

I have only very limited time since I have to run my main business to  
support my family. But if there's some work which needs my help,  
maybe I could contribute...

I suggest buddypress could retrieve the DB_CHARSET setting from
wp-config.php on wpmu, for example:

*define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8');*

and* *use it for all buddypress components, that should resolve this
problem.
btw, does anybody get the link mess-up problem? it is a big trouble for my
site now, I hope I could sort it out and integrate xprofile and messages
with my site. thanks!

Right now everyone working on BuddyPress is using subdomains. I'm  
going to set up a local install today using subfolders so I can test  
and fix these link issues.

I'll use this constant in the DB scheme to resolve this problem,  
thanks for that.

Thanks,
Andy

Right now there isn't anyone actively working on privacy. If you or  
anyone out there would like to tackle it, we'd be happy for the help.

We should try and do this the "right" way if possible. That is, can we  
utilize something like OAuth so that we don't have to ask for people's  
mail account login details? I know there are API's for the major web  
mail providers that let us do this.

I'm sure if we hunt there are good examples out there on the internets.

Andy, Thanks for your quick reply!

I did some further investigation about the link mess-up problem, and found
the line 127 and 128 in bp-xprofile.php caused the problem

"Line 127  query_posts('showposts=1');
 Line 128  if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
endwhile; endif;
"
comment these both 2 lines could solve the problem, but it seems the
function "the_profile_picture()" can't find the right user-id to render the
profile picture anymore.

Hope this would be helpful, thanks!

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Tagged components and roadmap
Message-ID: <026F1603-E5F5-4762-8312-820C48ABDCA8@automattic.com>

We have now started to tag components with version numbers. If you  
don't plan on writing any code, but simply want to try out or test  
BuddyPress components you should read the following:

http://trac.buddypress.org/wiki/installing-buddypress

Anyone not planning on developing should basically avoid the trunk in  
SVN from now on.

Based on the new roadmap: http://trac.buddypress.org/wiki/roadmap we  
will be tagging releases of each component when the functionality  
listed for that version has been completed. This will give the  
opportunity for people to download that version and test it.

I've just tagged version 0.1.1 of the core and the extended profiles  
component. The bug fixes from 0.1 are:

  - Fixed: Avatar uploads where the uploaded picture would not show up  
and the cropping box would overlap a grey box.
  - Fixed: Signup field element layouts for checkboxes and select boxes
  - Fixed: Signup field callback values when validation fails
  - Fixed: Inability to upload an avatar when using sub folders
  - Fixed: Blog switcher tab highlighting when using sub folders
  - Fixed: Category, archive, page and other link problems when using  
the extended profile component (can someone confirm this, as it is  
hard to test on a blank install).

Just barely upgraded and am having the same problem with links.  I have been
out of the loop...has there been any update on this?  (I'm using subdomains)

just had a quick try on v0.11, it did fix the avatar uploading problem on
subdirectory installed wpmu, but link mess-up problem still existed, it
seems the following two lines in bp-xprofile.php will make every category,
archive and page link always display the latest one post:

-------------------------------------------
Line 127   query_posts('showposts=1');
Line 128   if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
endwhile; endif;

thanks!

On my test site, profile information disappears once I logout of an

Do you have more details.  When you log back in does your profile
information come back or does logging out wipe out your database?
Also, which version are you running on?

it seems then the function renders profile information could not find the
right user id when you logged out. I also wonder how buddypress pick the
user id for rendering the profile info and avatar, since a bog could have
many users, many admins, which one will it pick?

When I log back in all the profile information is just gone.  It appears to
just wipe it out.  I've updated to mu 1.5.1 and am using the zip versions of
buddypress.

I can't seem to reproduce this problem. I thought it may have been due  
to introducing a rewind_posts() call to fix a previous bug. I've  
checked my local installation here and it seems to be working okay.

I'm going to do more extensive tests with the new 1.5.1 version of MU  
and see if the problem lies there.

It seems as though my rewind_posts() call did not fix this problem.  
Does anyone have an installation with this problem that I can get  
access to and bugfix on?

Reply to me directly.

Just an update...when I login as the admin the profiles display fine.  As
soon as a I logout and refresh the profiles, they disappear.  Pretty
strange.

Sorry...one more thing.  I logged in as profile1 and the data shows up.  But
when i look at other profiles while logged in as profile1, it shows me my
information from profile1 instead of the information that should be in the
other profiles.  Kind of hard to explain...

I think I know what you mean. It's part of how MU itself works. If I'm 
logged in as Site Admin and go to any member blog, visiting the profile 
area will always show my details.

I'm talking about on the output though, not the backend.  If I'm logged in
as John Doe and then visit other people's outputted profile pages, all the
profiles show John Doe's info.  The blog title, etc. is right but the
"basic" information and the extra profile fields I added all show John Doe's
stuff.  If I'm logged out, nobody's info shows up.

I suspect the function renders the profile takes the logged user's id by
mistake, it is supposed to take the id of the user belongs to the blog, but
the same question I asked before here, which user of the blog will it pick?
you know that a blog could have many users, many admins...

Isn't one of the restrictions in BP one user = one blog? (if not, it  
should be :)

But what you're saying sounds right Jerome. Let's follow it through...

It looks like the profile page (index.php) uses  
the_profile_field_value() to output a value.

That uses the data stored in a global called $field, which I think is  
populated somewhere along the line during a call like this:

$this->group->fields[$i] = new BP_XProfile_Field( $this->group->fields 
[$i]->id, $this->user_id );

$this->user_id at that point appears to have been populated during  
the creation of that object, using a global called $authordata. That  
appears to be set via WPMU (not BP), and only ever uses $post- 
 >post_author (probably in this case via setup_postdata() ?).

It looks like all of this triggered via a single-post query/loop in  
bp-xprofile.php::xprofile_profile_template() which theoretically  
should allocate the $authordata over to the author of any posts on  
that blog...

Which leads me to a question - are there *any* posts on those blogs  
that are not showing their profile properly? I haven't done a lick of  
testing or even run BP to see this problem in action, but following  
this thread it would seem like if there were no posts in a blog yet,  
then the author would never get allocated properly (and thus their  
profile data would not be loadable).

Anyone?

It should render the details for the blog owner. Basically, the ID for  
the user that has defined that blog as their primary blog. Your  
primary blog has a user icon next to the tab in the admin area. That  
is where your profile details will show. I believe I'm right in  
thinking a blog can only have one primary user assigned to it?

It was, but now it isn't, simply because we want to support existing  
WordPress MU installations. Here's how it works now:

"Multiple blog support: members of your network can now sign up and  
run more than one blog. Their primary blog is used as their 'home'  
where they can manage their friends/groups/messages etc (and their  
profile can be viewed). Other blogs just contain the normal WordPress  
blogging features. Their home account stays as the first tab in their  
admin interface and is marked with a user icon."

I believe this needs to be changed for two reasons...

  - This method is causing issues with links for categories etc etc as  
mentioned is some previous messages
  - If a blog has other authors, the author of the latest posts on the  
blog will define which ID is used. That's obviously not going to work.

Instead, it needs to fetch and use the user ID for the 'primary_blog'  
meta setting in the wp_usermeta table for the current blog.

There doesn't need to be any major architectural changes to make this  
happen, it's simply a matter of fetching the user ID and passing it to  
the right place.

That's a third reason why the current way isn't going to work. :)

thanks! Andy, hope the next build would come out soon.

I changed my wpmu from subdirectories to subdomain mode from now on, I can
not provide the test information for subdirecotries wpmu anymore.

btw, the links are still messed up on my sudomain wpmu site,

Andy, may I have a request for the charset of the DB? you said you will use
the constant "utf-8" in the DB scheme to resolve the problem, could you
include this fix in the next version 0.1.x? since it is a kind of "preview
release" for xprofile and private messaging components, it is intended to be
used and tested by the people around the world, thanks!

But unfortunately, I found it is possible to assign a blog as the primary

Hmm, I'm sure this was not the case on my installation. We will need  
to find a way to work around / address this if the above is correct.

Apologies for the delay in replying, I've been away at a wedding.

I tried introducing a rewind_posts() to address this problem, but it  
seems to not have worked.

I'm going to give it another shot tomorrow to see if there is another  
method of invoking the $authordata global.

good upgrading,thanks for the great job!

We have found a workaround to this (actually Matt did) that will fix  
the issues with blog owners and profiles. Instead of invoking the  
$authordata variable and using that to render the profile, we are  
matching the blog domain/path to the user.

So, if you visit "andy.buddypress.org" it will take the "andy" part  
and display the profile for the user "andy". That way, only the  
profile for the user that signed up with this blog will be shown. You  
can still assign new administrators/contributors/authors etc etc, but  
the owners profile will only ever show.

I've made this change and it seems to be working well for both  
subdomains and subfolders. It should also in theory fix the problems  
people have been having with links, pages and categories.

I will be checking this in shortly, and hoping to tag a v0.2 of the  
extended profile component ASAP. We still have a bunch of bugs to fix  
with some new feature additions.

Hi!

I'm not a developer so I'm just loitering wondering when the public release
will be.

I'm hoping to deploy for my school.

American Academy in Larnaca, Cyprus [www.academy.ac.cy] [awful site]

We have just rolled out a Drupal creation to celebrate our centenary [
aa100.info].

I have a WordPress blog [pburgess.net] that I use primarily for
communicating with my students and hence my growing interest and admiration
of WordPress. Colleagues have asked me to build something similar for them
and then I saw the WordPressMU that Harvard are using and then came across
BuddyPress. This appears perfect for our next web project which will be a
multiblog installation [initially for teachers but hopefully students later]
and file publishing. BuddyPress I hope will be the icing on the cake to
build community etc.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Private Messaging: a small problem when composing
	message
Message-ID: <3f7bc4310805220433x74806d04j340be3ac09ebc4f1@mail.gmail.com>

On Compose page, I got a yellow excalmatory mark icon on IE status, click
the icon it shows :

-------------------------------------------------

Line:495

Char:4

Error:Object doesn't support this property or method

Code:0

-----------------------------------------



I also found the text I input in the compose input box is very very small,
while it becomes normal when I sent this text message out or the text
display on Inbox page, it should get the "textarea" class from my wpmu css,
but it seems not, I wonder is it related to the above error.



furthermore, the same "small text" problem happens when you reply a message,
but without the yellow excalmatory mark icon on IE status.



did anybody here get the same problem? thanks!

Message-ID: <33d319940805221706k671473fdp13528cf5b8935b1e@mail.gmail.com>

After a fresh install of WPMU and adding the bp-core files I get this error:
*

Fatal error*: Cannot redeclare add_third_level() (previously declared in
/home/.lamenting/awedjob/

I did not get any errors after the WPMU install. With my current hosting
plan only allows ftp connections so I don't have SSH access. Not sure how
many other times "add_third_level" is called. Any fixes anyone could suggest
is appreciated.

Nothing like starting over from scratch to clear up any troubles. I got SSH
access, did the old rm -r *.*, created a new database and began anew. This
time I added the components one at a time instead of all at once.

Time to play with my new toy now.

In addditon, I found 2 more issues about private mesasges.

1. If A sent a message X to B, B deleted message X, next time if A reply on
message X (X still in his Sent Messages folder), B won't see A's reply.

2. If A sent a message X to B, but before B read it, A go to his Sent
Messages folder, click Message X, then message X won't be displayed as a new
message for B.

I'd like to suggest that with news/publication type blog networks, e.g.
HuffingtonPost, you're not interested in friendships as much as tracking a
particular author/blogger's latest articles.  In their set up, (which uses
MT), you are a 'fan' of a blogger, and can therefore keep up to date on his
latest posts.

What are the profile template tags?  :)  If I'm thinking right, they are
tags for each field so you can display the data in different places?  If so,
I'm not even sure how to use them.

This shouldn't be too hard to do. My latest friends code allows people
to categorise their friends, but it should be quite easy for someone
to set themselves as a fan of someone else - which would not require
confirmation of course. Yep, that shouldn't be hard at all.

Want some feedback on this. I needed to do some logic via php on my  
homepage/profile page of each blog/account. The functions in  
bp-xprofile-templatetags simply didn't give an option to return a  
value, only output it. So i made the following changes:

function the_profile_field_name($inline = false) {
	global $field;
	//modified by David
	if ($inline) {
		return $field->name;
	} else {
		echo $field->name;
	}

}

function the_profile_field_value($inline = false) {
	global $field;

	if ( bp_is_serialized($field->data->value) ) {
		$field_value = unserialize($field->data->value);
		$field_value = implode( ", ", $field_value );
		$field->data->value = $field_value;
	}

	if ( $field->type == "datebox" ) {
		$field->data->value = bp_format_time( $field->data->value, true );
	}

	//modified by David
	if ($inline) {
		return $field->data->value;
	} else {
		echo $field->data->value;
	}
}

Area modified below the comments.

Thoughts? Better ways? Should we built this option into these functions?

Message-ID: <20080527131752.x7iqzc8cg4owsocg@www.dimensionmedia.com>

Getting some strange behavior in the latest build of BP.

Avatar cropping tool jumps to the top in IE7. In Firefox, it's ok on  
the first screen but the next screen it completely breaks.

So my questions are:

1. Anyone else having this issue?

2. Is there a way to simply ask the user for a picture and  
automatically MAKE THAT THE AVATAR (bypassing the cropping tool  
altogether)?

I'm just wondering what situation you would need to return and not  
echo? The template tags are designed to function within 'the loop' and  
just spit out the right information. Usually you'd structure your HTML  
around this, and then call the template tags in the places where you  
want to render the profile data.

You might want to directly access the profile data object if you want  
to get hold of data instead of rendering it straight to the page. What  
do others think?

The template tags are new to me.  Can someone explain the purpose and how
they are used or point me to some documentation?

Andy,

I am trying to place specific information in specific places on my  
template, but I didn't see an easy way to do it in the files. Example:

<?php if ( group_has_fields() ) : ?>
<?php while ( profile_fields() ) : the_profile_field(); ?>
<?php if ( the_profile_field_name(true) == "Zip Code" ) : ?>
<?php $zipCode = the_profile_field_value(true); ?>
<?php endif; ?>
<?php endwhile; ?>
<?php endif; ?>

I'm realizing now that this probably isn't the best way, so perhaps  
you can show me the alternate?

Subject: [buddypress-dev] suggestion: profile avatar functions
Message-ID: <20080528003935.x0qz25d5sksw8skg@www.dimensionmedia.com>

just checked in the latest BuddyPress version tonight. One thing I noticed:

function the_profile_picture() {
	global $coreuser_id;
	echo xprofile_get_avatar($coreuser_id, 2);
}

Any reason why we can't have a function to pull the thumbnail?

function the_profile_picture_thumbnail() {
	global $coreuser_id;
	echo xprofile_get_avatar($coreuser_id, 1);
}

Also I want to be able to tell if the user has uploaded an avatar so I  
can place an "add photo/avatar" button on my template. Right now, I'm  
doing that by created the above function and adding this to my code:

<?php if (the_profile_picture_thumbnail(true) == XPROFILE_DEFAULT_AVATAR) {
<div class="addphoto">
<div class="icon"><a href="#"><img src="<?php  
bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?>/images/buttons/add_plus.gif"  
alt="" /></a></div>
<div class="phrase"><a href="#">Add Photo</a></div>
<br clear="all" />
</div> <!-- add photo -->
<? } ?>

Is there a better way? Hopefully you can see why I would desire to  
know if the user uploaded an avatar.

If anyone else can confirm this (or even if they can't), can someone  
please send me screenshots? I don't actually have immediate access to  
a machine with IE7 on it unfortunately, so it's hard to test/confirm  
this sort of thing.

Thanks,

No reason at all, I've added that to the template tags file and I'll  
check it in later today.

It's probably a better idea to make a 'user_has_avatar()' function, do  
the calculations in there so you can just do a:

<?php if ( !user_has_avatar() ) { ... } ?>
