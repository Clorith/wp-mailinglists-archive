Howdy!

I just had a few questions that I wanted to pose about a new
Buddypress install that I am working on.

1. I have a theme that was designed that I am planning on shipping out
to psd2html.com to create a Wordpress theme. Can I use this theme for
my main landing/splash page, then work off of the Buddpress theme for
my member pages?

2. If the answer is yes, are there some hooks that I can build into my
main theme for navigation shortcuts for say, my account, login and
others?

Thanks,

Jake Spurlock

Missing something?

Aha, I have this in my themes directory:

Broken Themes (Site admin only)
The following themes are installed but incomplete. Themes must have a
stylesheet and a template.

Name	Description
default/style.css	File not readable.
home/style.css	File not readable.

Sound's like you need to change the permissions on your wp-content/themes
folder. You'll also need to upload the buddypress theme to that folder.

My permissions are set at 755, and I have followed the directions for
the theme, it has been installed. Sorry, not trying to be difficult.

It looks like when I did the upload, the directories stayed at 755,
and the files went to 600. So, I am changing them now. More details to
follow...

Well, I got all of the permissions worked out. If you ever need to
change a whole bunch of things,  find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0
chmod 644 is sure a nifty piece of CLI beauty. I now have the core in
place, and can see the settings in the site admin. However, I am not
getting any of the other features, extended profiles, groups,
yada-yada-yada.

Did I miss a step?

Thanks for the help. If you want to take a gander, it is at petomundo.info.

How about chmod -R 644 * instead?

Because you only want your files at 644, your directories need to stay
at 755. The find command here only finds files (-type f).

They show up with links on the *front* end using the BP theme.

Message-ID: <AD3B474D-3DFF-4FB0-A66E-1F02C9DA7472@automattic.com>

Since it's been a little while since I've checked anything in, I  
thought I'd update everyone on what I've personally been working on  
for the past couple of weeks.

There has been a fair amount of talk about how BuddyPress will support  
existing blog network installations, as well as new installs. My  
primary focus for the past two weeks has been on introducing proper  
support for existing blog networks.

Here's what I've done:

Every user of an existing install (whether they have a blog or not)  
will need to sign up for a "Home Base". This is essentially a blog,  
but *without* any blogging features at all. Current members will see a  
"Create Home Base" tab in their admin area once BuddyPress is  
installed, where they can follow simple steps to create a home base.  
Once they have created a home base, the tab will disappear.

The default BuddyPress theme will be used for all home bases, where as  
any blog theme can be used for any other blogs. The home base  
represents the user as a person, and will contain all of their  
BuddyPress data (profile, messages .. ). The admin area for the home  
base will contain tabs for profile, messages, groups, friends and so  
on. No blog tabs. One home base to one user.

Of course, custom BuddyPress enabled themes could be used for user's  
home base. It may even be possible to let users select from BuddyPress  
enabled themes for their home base in the future. The plan is to make  
it easy to "BuddyPress enable" existing WordPress themes.

No blogging features on the home base means no blog in the default  
BuddyPress theme. This has all been removed. However, in its place is  
a "Blogs" menu item. This contains 3 sub items:

  - My Blogs - which lists every blog you have privileges for in the  
network.
  - Recent Posts - Lists the last 10 posts you have made across any  
blog in the network
  - Recent Comments - Lists the last 25 comments you have made across  
any blog in the network

Now, for new installations this means users are first signing up for a  
home base rather than a blog. They would then create their first blog  
once their account and home base is activated and set up.

Interestingly - this gives site administrators the option to  
completely leave out blogging functionality from their BuddyPress  
installation if they wish.

I have created a new component "bp-blogs" that will eventually provide  
the ability to enable/disable blogging functionality. At the moment it  
is tracking and recording posts, comments, and blogs for users across  
an installation.

Also:

I have included an "admin bar" that will persist across the top of all  
screens in a BuddyPress enabled install. The bar is almost identical  
to the one you see on WordPress.com. The menu includes quick drop down  
links to BuddyPress component functionality, and very soon quick links  
to blog author profiles/friends/groups etc when viewing a blog.

If some or all of the above doesn't make any sense, it will once you  
see the new functionality working. By making the user assign  
themselves a home base, the problem of "blog centric vs user centric"  
should be eliminated.

Cheers,
Andy

Most likely the middle of next week. I was aiming for Friday, but  
there are a few things still to fix up.

While we're on the topic of "progress so far" would it be possible for
someone to give a quick rundown of where things are at, very broadly
speaking?  I check the trac and timeline and roadmap and all that pretty
regularly, but as someone who's a blogger first, a designer second and a
devloper third, I don't really have a sense for how far along things are in
plain language. I set up an install a few weeks ago and some features
weren't working.  I posted a bug but it looks like it was removed/deleted.
Perhaps I did it wrong.

Thanks!

Hi Andy,

all this sounds great, just what I was looking for in the start. Now, 
will it be straightforward to update an existing BP install with the new 
stuff or is it likely to cause problems?

Also, I've been delving deeper into my current project and one of my 
client's requests was to have a Members listing page where the display 
would include: Avatar, Name, City, Country, an excerpt from and "About 
Me" field and the person's blogs. Also, the list needs to be sortable by 
name, city, country and searchable by name. This was a bit of a 
challenge to implement as the profile fields are set up the way they are 
in the bp_xprofile_* tables. I ended up loading the data into an array 
and performing the sorting etc in php which isn't so optimal. I'm 
concerned that there could be performance issues in a production 
environment with this solution.

This brings me to the question whether the BP team has been considering 
issues such as this? Is there any way to make it easy to handle lists of 
members (and blogs) with the extra profile info?

Regards,
Robert

Are you creating them using a basic text editor like textmate or  
notepad? Other editors may add program specific characters to the  
file, causing issues.

Likely to cause problems. There is no way around this as it's a fairly  
significant change to the underlying architecture. You could get  
around it by manually adding usermeta to the DB. You'd need to add  
this metadata for each user:

user_id: the user id
metakey: home_base
metavalue: the blog id of the blog to make the home base.

Definitely interested to hear possible solutions to this. Perhaps  
there is a better way to structure the DB tables for the xprofile  
component? I'll have a look into ways we can make this easier.  
Suggestions from any developers on the list would be awesome.

As the home theme (which will be the place for member lists/blog lists/ 
aggregated content) hasn't been built yet, no. Once we get to that,  
then these issues will be addressed and we'll build functions to make  
this easy.

Cheers
Andy

Message-ID: <E3FB93C3-CADF-4D22-AA66-CB5B5C866AE4@automattic.com>

I've now checked in all the changes that have been worked on for the  
past two weeks.

Revision 309 major changes include:

* Support for 'Home Bases' where a user can create a blog as a home  
base and make use of all the BuddyPress features

* New component 'bp-blogs' adds tracking of blogs, posts and comments  
across the network.

* Updates to the admin area for a home base, beginnings of a new  
dashboard, re-enabled tabs for account, profile and blogs.

Full list of changes can be viewed here:
http://trac.buddypress.org/changeset?new=309%40%2F&old=307%40%2F

How do you see doing updates then? What kind of stability do you see
in moving up versions? I have a working version now, can I run the
updates, or I am in danger of losing information?

are you sure about the line endings? I don't use bbedit, but on other
projects, a mismatch between line endings of my editor, and what the
server software expected was an issue.

You won't lose any information, the only issue is around assigning a  
user's blog as their home base.

Previously, a user's "home" would be their primary blog, but this  
doesn't work as it isn't a one to one relationship.

If you upgraded your install right now, existing BuddyPress blogs will  
return to normal WordPress blogs. Each user will then be asked to sign  
up for a home base to continue using the BuddyPress features.

Their information shouldn't be lost, as they still have the same user  
id. Your profile fields and settings definitely will not be lost.

This is a recommended upgrade, as it includes a large amount of  
structural updates and bug fixes. All features moving forward will  
rely on the structural changes made.

I have just committed some bug fixes - if you check out rev 310, these  
bugs are fixed.

Or the zip link is at the bottom of this page:

Make sure you have WPMU up and running correctly first, and that you  
can log in and create blogs ok.

Once you have that, you should be able to just drop in the plugins  
into the mu-plugins directory and then copy the two themes into the wp- 
content/themes directory.

I have tested that it is working with new installs using both subdir  
and subdomains on WPMU 2.6.1.

Also one thing to mention for those of you upgrading to the latest in  
trunk.

Make sure you replace the "default" theme back with the original  
WordPress default theme. The BuddyPress theme is now in a separate  
BuddyPress theme folder.

When you sign up on your site the accounts are not activating. This is  
the same when you create a home base.

I'm not sure why this is, it could be something in your WPMU install,  
or home theme? Try signing up an account to see what I mean.

http://testdrivewpmu.com is now running the latest version of  
BuddyPress.

To keep things simple, accounts have been reset and the base install

You will need to sign up again if you'd like to test. This should  
(fingers crossed) be the last time this needs to be done.

I signed up but still have to create a blog sign up again. I was given the subdomain name when I first registered then create a blog which it asked for a subdomain name. Why do I need to do that. In the backend, it still asked to create a blog even I did. I dont think its worked on testdrivewpmu.com with updates.

When you signup with BuddyPress, you are always signing up for an  
account first. You will not get a blog until you specifically create  
one once you log in.

I've filed a bug for this as the wording needs to be changed on the  
"Give me a blog" part of the signup form.

Would it be easier if I sign up for jedi.testdrivewpmu.com then select to create a blog instantly after register instead of "register" for the blog. Is there a reason why we are seeing this concept? Could we enable for every register to have a blog instantly for the first time when he or she register?

When you signup with BuddyPress, you are always signing up for an  
account first. You will not get a blog until you specifically create  
one once you log in.

I've filed a bug for this as the wording needs to be changed on the  
"Give me a blog" part of the signup form.

But Andy, couldn't you keep the original Mu option on sign-up where 
users can choose if they want a blog or just an account and then create 
a blog if they select that option? That would be the optimal way in my 
view. Of course they will always have the option to create a blog later 
if they haven't chosen so on sign-up.

This would be a nice way of doing it, but it would require a lot more  
work than that. When creating a BuddyPress account, you are actually  
creating a blog regardless of your choice, but it's used as a home  
base. The signup would have to be changed to you could create two  
blogs at the same time.

Perhaps in a future version this can be done, but at the moment this  
should work for most people.

Cheers
Andy

I am going to use BUDDYPRESS as my community platform for sure! I prefer that everyone register with a blog and username same time without giving them an option. Thats the way I wanted to offer using BUDDYPRESS platform. 

I tried Elgg and still prefer WP/Buddypress but Elgg is a very nice for social networking with v1.0 to start with. Andy, hope you could make it more simpler instead adding more steps to complete the process.

I see your predicament here, fair enough. So essentially, your home base 
is an empty blog but your actual blog is another blog you would create 
once you're signed up.
I guess my immediate concerns are whether you can clearly distinguish 
the home base from the actual member blog. For my current project, I've 
made the previous Buddypress release work reasonably well so now I will 
need to see how much of my stuff will break. As long as I can find the 
member profiles and member blog(s) and retrieve profile and blog data, 
I'll be OK.

Now another thing that is a slight annoyance is the author profile data 
in the WP admin. Unfortunately it doesn't "sync" up with the BP profile 
data and could be confusing for the average member. Can this be 
addressed somehow? It would be good if, at least, we could hide some of 
the WP author profile data fields so that they are less confusing. In 
the front end, all my author links go to the BP profile anyhow. Ideally, 
it would be cool to "mirror" at least the First / Last Name fields and 
set the display_name to fn ln on sign-up. This would make the admin for 
users more consistent as well...

Well, I hope I'm not ranting too much here but these things are concerns 
I can see come up when using BP. I'm also quite happy to fiddle with the 
code to sync the BP profile data with the WP author profile if that is 
the way to go as long as I can get some pointers as to what I need to do 
for that. This could also mean that at least a member list with names 
can be generated much more efficiently than now.

Kind regards,
Robert

The problem with that approach is it means existing blog networks  
would have a really difficult time using the BuddyPress plugins. It  
would force restrictions that previously did not exist. By handling it  
this way it allows both new networks and existing networks to use  
BuddyPress. Creating a blog and account all under one sub domain puts  
a lot of restrictions on the underlying WordPress software - and why  
restrict something so great?? :)

I agree it adds a step, which is not ideal, but in the long run it  
will allow many more people to make use of BuddyPress.

Honoring the "gimme a blog/just a username" option should be possible,  
I'm going to look into how much work that will be. I think that should  
take out a lot of the confusion.

Basically, your home base does not function as a blog. From an end  
user's perspective there are no blogging features at all. The home  
base is where your profile, messages, group lists, friend lists are  
all kept. It's where other members and the public will go to view your  
details. It's your account home, a place where all your activity is  
aggregated.

There are functions to check:

bp_is_home() - will return true if the current blog is the users home  
base.
$bp['loggedin_domain'] - will always contain the URL of the users home  
base.

In the admin area for the user, the users home base is indicated by a  
user icon, where as blogs have page icons. The home base admin area  
contains no blogging tabs. Any link back to an author on a blog  
comment, blog post, wire comment or anywhere on a BuddyPress install  
will link back to a users home base.

In the latest build, all references to built in WordPress profile data  
have been removed. End users have no access to these input fields or  
the ability to view the data.

Take a look at the friends_get_friends_list() function (http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk/bp-friends.php#L224 
). For now you could modify this function to list all members  
alphabetically. You'd just need to fetch all member ids, instead of  
just friend ids.

This sounds good too. However, my question was referring more to the 
control you have when you're on the main site with a BP install. My main 
site will have a member and blog list and site-wide tags, site wide 
latest posts  etc as well as main site posts (and we will even have a 
concept of external blogs which is an option we want to give our members 
who already have a blog elsewhere).  So, at the moment I'm using a few 
of the bp_ functions (like bp_get_field_data bp_user_full_name, 
bp_core_get_userid...) to get data on my home page and main site blog 
Since I want to display a user controls box as soon as someone logs into 
the site. The "Me" and "You" paradigm of the BuddyPress template won't 
quite work for my case but that's OK I can work around it and will 
create my own templates for the BP profile, messaging etc... features.

Ok... I guess I'll have to see it. I will take the plunge, back 
everything up and try an upgrade this week and see what I need to change 
to get things working again.


Thanks for taking the time to answer all our questions here, much 
appreciated!

Hi Jake,
The countries.csv file uses UTF-8 encoding (with no BOM) (with (I
think) linux line endings, whereas your Dogs.csv is simple Mac format
(line endings) with ascii(8) encoding.

That is likely reason for the wierd characters you see. Presumably
some code somewhere is expecting/assuming UTF-8 encoding.


Hope that helps,

Mike

Hi,
my name is Margarit Mu?a. I'm encountering a lot of difficulties using  
Buddypress.
take a look at the blog I've created with my wordpress mu  
installation: http://imargarit.ylber.org/
Why can't I see all the graphics of thetheme you provide?

I'm also registered in testdrivewpmu.com as ilmargarit and I find that  
there is something new abiut buddypress. Yhing that that I'd like to  
have in my installation, like a bar prominent on the top, an the  
possibilities to have a default theme for the profiles, messages,  
friend, a sort of new dashboard and other themes for the optional  
blog. This is what I need and I would pay for this. lease put it on  
the Trac Server.

Thank you

Hi,
I've noticed that only the blogs created after the creation of the
home bases are listed under "my blogs" in my home base/profile. The
older blogs aren't; and if I try to create a new blog with the same
name of my existent blog it says that the operation is succesfull, but
the blog doesn't appear in "my blogs" anyway....

Me and my colleagues are enthusiasts about buddypress! Thanks for the
work, especially of the last month! ;)

Regards,
Alessandro

OK - got that working.  So is it really anyone connected with the main blog
that cannot setup profiles?  Is it possible to setup those people from the
database side?
Thanks,
tom

This shouldn't be happening, there is a function that will register  
existing blogs and blog posts when you sign up for a home base. Can  
you file a bug and explain your steps?

Message-ID: <C4ED5167.534A%brian.brey@nxtstudios.com>

Hi Andy,

Other than rolling back to a previous trunk release. Do any suggestions on
how to revert back to the previous single sub domain functionality?

The home-base concept throws a bit of a wrench into my anticipated use of
buddypress. I had made some customization to the wpmu_functions.php file to
auto generate some static pages, one for audio/video, in which I had
integrated wordtube, and the other as a gallery which is set for using the
bulletin album function of WP, the blog was planned to be a part of the mix
as well. Having it under one umbrella makes it a bit easier for users to
navigate and understand how the system works.

Thanks a bunch.

Brian

There's no reason why a "single blog" plugin couldn't be written to do  
this, and then just remove the bp-blogs component. You'd need to re- 
add the single blog support to the theme, but that is simple enough.

I don't see any reason why new and updated components shouldn't close  
to work with the old way. You may need to add in a couple of  
functions, but overall much the same functions are used - they just do  
things a little differently now.

Inevitably the structural change was going to mess up some people's  
plans, sorry about that. It had to be done though. The way it was  
before just wasn't going to work in the long run, and would have cut  
out a lot of potential uses.

I don't think we will see any major structural changes to the way  
things work from now on. Now that the "blog vs user" problem has been  
resolved it should be smooth sailing.

It looks like the blog_id is getting messed up and set to null?

here is the error from the logs:

[Thu Sep 11 21:29:12 2008] [error] [client x] WordPress database error
Table 'x_petomundo.wp__options' doesn't exist for query SELECT * FROM
wp__options WHERE option_name = 'siteurl' made by get_blog_option,
referer: http://petbreeds.petomundo.info/wp-admin/edit.php?paged=4

I'm guessing that it shouldn't be .wp__options and .wp_6_options for
example.

Thanks,
Stephen

Message-ID: <7C73A934-0C29-42DA-8734-ECBE82B26BA5@yahoo.it>

I need some help,
I started using buddypress 2 weeks a go for my site www.ylber.com, and  
it worked pretty good but now it doesn't work.

today I downloaded again the plugins and the themes and put them all  
in the proper directories but it gives me this error:

Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '=', expecting ')' in /home/ 
ylberorg/public_html/wp-content/mu-plugins/bp-blogs/bp-blogs- 
templatetags.php on line 344

What does it mean?
I have to make some corrections on my own?
thank you

Hi Margarit,

I am also in the middle of a new WPMu+BP development and upgraded to the 
latest BP SVN. I decided that it was easier if I just started from 
scratch rather than figure out how to retrofit the latest changes. There 
appear to be quite a few structural changes in the new BP code so I'd 
say, start again. Some of the options Buddypress now uses have changed 
from the previous version and it introduces new options and template 
functions...

Kind regards,
Robert

Subject: [buddypress-dev] My experience upgrading to latest Trunk r337
Message-ID: <48CB011C.7070902@gmail.com>

I took the plunge yesterday and upgraded to the most recent changes in 
Buddypress. I decided to start from scratch as it seemed it would take 
more time to retro fit everything and make it work as I already had a 
number of blogs and users etc... All in all, I had to make a few 
modifications to my custom functions that interact with buddypress but 
nothing too major and everything works as expected now. In the process I 
noticed a couple of bugs in the bp_core_get_avatar() function so here's 
my version of it (changes highlighted in red):

function bp_core_get_avatar( $user, $version = 1, $no_tag = false, $width = null, $height = null ) {
	if ( !is_int($version) )
		$version = (int) $version;

	if ( CORE_AVATAR_V2_W == false && CORE_AVATAR_V2_H == false )
		$version = 1;

	$home_base_id = get_usermeta( $user, 'home_base' );
	$url = get_blog_option($home_base_id, 'siteurl');

	if ( !$width )
		$width = constant('CORE_AVATAR_V' . $version . '_W');

	if ( !$height )
		$height = constant('CORE_AVATAR_V' . $version . '_H');

	$str = get_usermeta( $user, "bp_core_avatar_v$version" );

	if ( strlen($str) ) {
		if ( $no_tag )
			return $url . '/' . $str;
		else
			return '<img src="' . $url . '/' . $str . '" alt="" class="avatar" width="' . $width . '" height="' . $height . '" />';
	} else {
		if ( $no_tag )
			return CORE_DEFAULT_AVATAR_THUMB;
		else
			return '<img src="' . CORE_DEFAULT_AVATAR . '" alt="" class="avatar" width="' . $width . '" height="' . $height . '" />';
	}
}


However, I'd like to see this function to be a bit more flexible and 
allow for custom alt and title tags. Also, if $no_tag is true, it would 
be nice if it returned both the image URL and the profile URL.

Anyhow, I'm quite pleased with this new version but I'd like to have the 
option to not display the user admin nav on the front end when the user 
is logged in and on the main site blog as, I'm sure, many people would 
want to do their own 'user thing' on the main site blog. For example, I 
have a box in the sidebar on my main home theme showing the logged in 
user and some quick links... Is there an easy hack to just display the 
top admin bar on the user home base or on the profile theme only? I 
guess I could move the add_action( 'wp_footer', 'bp_core_admin_bar' ); 
to the buddypress theme? I realise that this is still very much WIP and 
I'm sure these things will be refined...

Cheers for the good work on this, much appreciated!


Kind regards,
Robert

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Suggestion to add filter when rendering profile
	field values
Message-ID: <48CB5B19.6050404@gmail.com>

Hey Andy,

a bit of background for the suggestion: one of our profile fields is a 
URL to an external website. Currently there's no way to render this 
field with a link when someone enters a URL so I thought that if would 
be cool if the bp_the_profile_field_value() function would add a filter 
whereby users could add their own filter processing functions to mangle 
the output (like I've done in my hack below...). So I've added the 
filter as shown:

....
    // HACK added filter here for custom processing
    $field->data->value = apply_filters('bp_render_field_value', 
$field->data->value);
    // end HACK
    if ( BP_FRIENDS_IS_INSTALLED )
        echo stripslashes($field->data->value);
    else
        echo stripslashes($field->data->value);
}


This allows me to run a custom function and render my URL nicely...

Regards,
Robert

Thank you Andy for the answer but a friend of mine solved this problem  
and I just wanted to write you to tell the way he solved it. Was it a  
syntax error? I don't know. I'm completely ignorant.
But Now I have another problem.  I start from the begining:
I unistalled the wordpress MU installation from my servers and  
installed it again. Then I uploaded again all the BUddypress Plugins  
and the two themes following step by step the instructions inthe  
README.TXT link  on buddypress trac server. BUt I cannot see the CSS  
of My site. All i can see is black and blue (links) text. I don't know  
why it doesn't work.This was the first reason that made decide to  
remove buddy press one week a go. But I thought it was my fault, and  
please if it is my fault tell me which was my fault. I deleted the  
home theme and then uploaded the buddypress home theme. What's rong?  
Then I uploaded also the the Buddypress.
I didn't look as it should. Then i went to see in "Site admin",  
"themes" to enable the recent themes, all done. But again it doesn't  
work.

Please give me some help.
I'm seriously interested in this project and I want to use it.
Thank you.

I know it's late, but it seems too short for me to understand.
I changed the permisiions on the directory "wp-content" and all its  
subdirectories from 755 to 777.
Am I right?
notthing changes no CSS.
I dont'know what to do.

Did you change the permissions of the folder or the files contained therein?

Make sure that you style.css is 777, or 775.

I just finished bothering jake about my ignorance with server  
permissions and now I need some other help...
I now tried the new function of the Home base, which is certainly  
great but I think it would be greater if there was the possibility to  
create the home base "the profile " (whith all the social network  
features without creating necessarly the blog, and only if a user  
needs it give him the possibility to simply create it.
I don't know if it can't work like or if I just don't know how to do  
this.

Please some help.
Thank you again.

Message-ID: <e3cd39280809140507p2383d4eu4a82c77330ecf780@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've just done a fresh install of WPMU 2.6.1 and then added the
BuddyPress plugins and theme as per the INSTALL-README.txt.

Everything goes well until I 'hit the view site' button (step 6) and I
see a 404 error on the right half of the screen:

http://josswinn.org/social/joss

Also, the avatar I uploaded does not display although it appears OK in
the admin screens.

Finally, when trying to login from the URL above (in the left-hand
panel), I'm directed to http://josswinn.org/wp-login.php and given a
404 there, too.

Any help appreciated!

Was WPMU working okay before you installed the plugins?

Looks like you are getting a blank screen on the home screen: http://josswinn.org/

Check to make sure you have PHP error reporting turned on, and see  
what that gives you.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Suggestion to add filter when rendering profile
	field values

Great stuff, I haven't really added any BP hooks or filters yet.  
Definitely need to go through and add ones where they make sense. I'll  
add this one, and if anyone else has good suggestions for hook and  
filter locations feel free to submit a patch or reply to this thread.

Cheers
Andy

I know, I already made this question but I didn't recieve any question.
I noticed that when I registered on "testdrivewpmu.com" and created an  
account it automatically created my home base with all the social  
network features of buddypress working properly. Then I had the  
possibility to create all the blogs that I want (i think) but I don't  
need it for now. I took a look to andy's profile and saw that a user  
the could create all the blogs he wanted after he registered in the  
community. But in my installation I notice that when a user registers  
on the community with a new username, it's given automatically a new  
blog and then he has the possibility to create the home base. This  
could be confusing because te user inserts the informations he thinks  
will appear on his profile, but it will be a blog. After to create a  
profile and get connected to other users he has to create a home base  
and choose another username because the username he chosed for his own  
profile is now part of the URL of the blog.
I know that there could be a simple way to fix but I don't know it.
The standard wpmu installation gave the possibility to chose when  
registering between "Give me a Blog and Username, Give me just a  
Username", and also Wordpress.com works like this.

I don't know. Maybe I'm asking too much.
Thank you again and excuse me for my ugly english and my long e-mails.

Hi Margarit,

it sounds like something isn't right with your installation of WP-MU and 
BuddyPress. When I updated to this latest version of BP, I started from 
scratch (as I explained before) and it all worked fine. Make sure you 
have the bp_blogs component installed as this is the component that 
handles the profiles/blogs.

Regards,
Robert

It's just another BuddyPress component. It is part of the latest 
BuddyPress bundle when you download it from the Track SVN Trunk 
(http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk - at the bottom there is a 
link to download the whole trunk as a zip archive).

So, it installs just like all the other BuddyPress components under 
mu-plugins so your directory and file structure under mu-plugins should be:

/bp-blogs
/bp-core
/bp-friends
/bp-groups
/bp-messages
/bp-xprofile
bp-blogs.php
bp-core.php
bp-friends.php
bp-groups.php
bp-messages.php
bp-xprofile.php

Hope this helps.

Robert

Thank you Robert,
I know what it s, I know where it is.
I don't know HowI to "Make sure I have the bp_blogs component  
installed as this is the component that handles the profiles/blogs."
What should I see and what should I do?
Thank you again

Well, if it's there, then it should just work. There is no visible 
interface to it as far as I can tell, apart from the functionality that 
it brings.

So, I'm not sure why your installation is not behaving the way the test 
site is...

Regards,
Robert

Actually, if you login under the admin account, when you go to Site
Admin you will find a profiles section. If that is there, then you
know it works.

I'm sorry.
The problem was that I made a new user registration while I was logged  
in as admin and it created just a blog without creating previously the  
profile.
I tried it logging out and inserting the data of my sister and it all  
worked. The problem doesn't exist. The only problem I'm encountering  
now is with the personal picture. From safri I can't upload the photo.  
I will try from Firefox.
I'm really sorry for bothering you.
Thank you again Jake and Robert.

Margarit,

One thing that may help get quick responses is to jump on the
#buddypress channel on Freenode IRC. There is ususally a few people
that can help answer questions.

Yes, WPMU was working fine, before.

I have a test WPMU install at /blogs/ and BuddyPress at /social/

My root URL is supposed to be blank. Everything is on sub-domains or
at josswinn.org/...

Cheers
Joss

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Question User subdomain/ Blog subdomain
Message-ID: <839639.39769.qm@web25804.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi!

First: Great Job with Buddypress, it?s very cool!

Second: a little problem for me:

When somebody signs in my site, first, create his user (user.mydomain.com), and he can add friends,create groups,,....but if he want create his own blog, then it?s created a new subdomain for that blog (blog.mydomain.com). Then, each user has a subdomain for his profile and other subdomain for his own blog.

Is it possible that when a user signups, the same subdomain created work as profile and as blog?

thanks!

Bye!

Okay, that's the problem. Right now BuddyPress will only work when  
WPMU is installed in the root.

It would work if you had:

    http://blogs.josswin.org/ and http://social.josswin.org/

and you use a subdirectory installation (http://social.josswin.org/andy/profile 
) but it won't work when WPMU is installed in a sub directory.

This is probably a good timer to de-lurk.

I am planning a several sites with social features, and about to test BP.

Currently, my technical options are between Drupal and WP/WPMU.

I have experience with Drupal and WP, I installed WPMU over the
weekend play with, it looks fine enough (although I wonder if users
can add their own theme, plugins, etc. Maybe, but I ran out of time,
so it is an open question to me for now).

On these sites, there will be several classes of users.

Some classes (more then one)I would like to allow to have blogs,
others not, only social networking features.

For the first site, the  blogs are more important in v1.0 than the
social stuff, so I may be able to wait for BP to mature a bit.

I had pictured a URL strucure something like this:

1 - www.domain.com - overall site install of wpmu
2 - either:
       - member.classx.domain.com
       - classx.domain.com/member
where x = (1...n) for the classes that have blogs
3 - www.domain.com/profile/member for profiles of all members, whether
they are members of classes with blogs or not
4 - ability to search across all blogs
5 - tags on blog entries that work across blogs

I am willing to write some code on 4 and maybe 5, and willing to use
mod_rewrite as needed for 1,2,3 although I hope I don't have to.

Is this the sort of thing that WPMU/BP will be able to handle?

Are there other suggrested configs that might work better for me given
the various classes of users?

Best,

Barry

Message-ID: <31fae6190809151056j3e2774f7m690218db05052193@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I would like to use Buddypress to start a new online community, however I
want it to be 100% Dutch.

I have been googleing for info about translating WordPress Multiple users
(WPMU) and Buddypress, but all I find is about translating the normal WP.

Can somebody give me some info on how to get the started with translating
WPMU and Buddypress?

I guess it's a matter of translating POT and PO files, but I have no clue on
where I can find them for the latest version of WPMU.

I also have no clue where the buddypress modules will check for language
files.

As you can see, I'm a newby when it comes to translating WPMU, but I would
love to do it, not only because I need them, I guess a lot more people want
them sooner or later.

I have tried the forum on the dutch WP website, but it looks like it's not
really active, so that's why I'm trying this channel now.

Kind regards,

Florin

I thought I'd chime in on a couple of the non-BP related questions &

Nope, they can't. Themes & plugins are shared across users, and also 
allowing them this kind of access opens up a security nightmare.

not built in but doable a couple ways. Plugin already available.

Single-blog tagging is built in and there's a couple sitewide tags 
plugins out there already.

Thanks Andrea, that helps!

I hope this is not considered too far off topic to pursue a couple of
WPMU questions here, as it directly affects the consideration I will
have for choosing wpmu/buddypress...

Can I, as overall admin, limit a blog to a subset of themes? I don't
mind installing them for a particular user (that will be a premium
service after all) but I will want each user to have exclusive access
to that theme that they paid for (and may match their corp look/feel
etc.)

Best,

Barry

OK, that takes care of my WPMU concerns, thanks Andrea. Is there a
better list for any additional ones I might have?

Also, the BP questions regarding domain configuration are still open
as a reminder for anyone :)

Best,

Message-ID: <36ad261a0809151314i5d9aa22ap4a8c981348c8cd66@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to download the zip files listed on:
http://trac.buddypress.org/wiki/installing-buddypress

the links there don't work with wget in my shell, well, they do, but
they don't return zip files.

I know in theory I could use svn,  but I don't have it (and for some
weird dependency reason I don't care to bother with right now because
I use HG on my projects, I can't install it either).

Do I really really need to dl the zip files to my client and then
upload them to the server? That is kind of a pain for me and for
people in general, can't the links just point to the files?

Your best bet by far is SVN as you can easily keep up to date with  
changes (it's changing all the time) and check out the code remotely.

But yes, if you use the zips you will have to download and then  
upload. You can download 1 zip file at the bottom of this screen that  
will give you everything:

http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk

Zip files are the only way as the code is all in the SVN repository  
and not sitting on a server somewhere. I'm not sure what difference  
just pointing to the files would make in any case - you'd still need  
to download and then upload.

Not really - I live in a shell window on my server :)

I typically right click on a link, choose "save link location", then
move to the shell, type "wget " and then paste and enter, and voila,
the download happens. totally scriptable too if need be, highly
recommended....

If I do that now, I get an html file I haven't dug into instead of the
zip file...


If I move beyond the evaluation stage here, I guess I will try to
resolve the rpm conflict on my server,  but I prefer not to as it
looks like a pain, the conflict iswith PHP dependencies, and I have
live sites on this server so I am not really keen on downgrading a
library just to have svn.

OTOH, the server is scheduled for a system update sometime relatively
soon, and that will probably resolve itself.

Still, the links on trac should "just work" IMHO...

Best,

Barry

Hi Luca,

You are using the old version of the theme (and possibly the  
BuddyPress plugins).

Delete all the BuddyPress plugins in your installation, as well as the  
themes. Download the zip file at the bottom of this page (or use SVN  
if you know how).

http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk

Follow the installation instructions file and you should be fine.

Andy

Hi Andy, 

Have you given any additional thoughts into the album plugin for buddypress?
I?m curious as to the direction you are going to go, weather its using the
existing album functionality of WPMU or the use of an a current plugin..

Cheers!

Andy answered this kind of question somewhere on the WPMu forums I 
believe. It's going to use the built in WP [gallery] tag. I guess, one 
could see to adapt other gallery plugins to work with BP. I would 
anticipate that people would want some more levels of sophistication 
with the gallery. Like quotas, permissions, tags, categories etc...

Message-ID: <6DD91D6A-F319-4F09-B5B4-5D1071B38C09@automattic.com>

I've checked in the initial version of the wire component this evening.

I've built it in a way that will let other component developers to  
enable a wire on their own custom BuddyPress components. I'll post  
more about that soon.

The first version doesn't contain any AJAX. In the next revision I'd  
like to add AJAX posting, in just the same way posting replies to  
private messages works. There is also no pagination on the "view all"  
wire view yet. This means you'll only see the latest 5 wire posts  
right now. I'll likely add that in tomorrow, as it just needs some  
template tags.

You'll also notice I've added a few widgets to the profile page for  
users. Each profile page will now show a random selection of the users  
friends as well as their groups. It'll also tally total groups and  
friends.

Check it out on testdrivewpmu.com:
http://andy.testdrivewpmu.com/profile

The latest version is now running there, so log back in and give the  
new features a go.

All this new stuff can be checked out of SVN or downloaded at: http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk

Latest revision as of right now is rev 348.

Cheers
Andy

By the way, Barry,
The reason wget didn't work is that the url for the zip file has
ampersands '&' in it. Which the shell steals and interprets as an
instruction to run wget (with only half the url) in the background.
enclose the url in single quotes and it downloads, though it still
doesn't get the name right. wget doesn't automatically honour the
'Content-Disposition: inline;; filename=' header.

Links on the other hand does honour the header and save with the
correct filename. It requires some interaction though.

Hope that helps.

Hi,

I would like to use Buddypress to start a new online community,
however I want it to be 100% Dutch.

I have been googleing for info about translating WordPress Multiple
users (WPMU) and Buddypress, but all I find is about translating the
normal WP. Can somebody give me some info on how to get the started
with translating WPMU and Buddypress?

I guess it's a matter of translating POT and PO files, but I have no
clue on where I can find them for the latest version of WPMU. I also
have no clue where the buddypress modules will check for language
files. As you can see, I'm a newby when it comes to translating WPMU,
but I would love to do it, not only because I need them, I guess a lot
more people want them sooner or later.

I have tried the forum on the dutch WP website, but it looks like it's
not really active, so that's why I'm trying this channel now.

Kind regards,

Florin

You should be able to follow the same instructions. I believe  
translating WPMU works the same way as regular WordPress.

BuddyPress uses the WordPress translation functions, so you should be  
able to translate BuddyPress in the same way.

I don't know too much about this, so you might want to ask on the  
forums.

Cheers
Andy

Subject: [buddypress-dev] BuddyPress Email notifications
Message-ID: <48D02F42.5030605@gmail.com>

Hi Andy,

I'm just wondering about email notifications when someone has a friend 
request or group invite or private message etc... Obviously BuddyPress 
isn't sending anything out at the moment. I think this is an important 
feature and I'm wondering when do you think this will be addressed? 
Also, I would love to see the emails configurable in terms of content 
and choice of Plain Text/HTML. Also, members should have options to 
enable/disable notifications on a per component basis.


Depending on my workload, I could possibly contribute some code to this 
but can't guarantee anything at the moment as I need to get my current 
project finished as soon as possible.

Kind regards,
Robert

Definitely, at the moment only group invites are sending out emails.  
It'd be great if we could come up with some generic way to send emails/ 
check user email settings so any core or custom component could use it.

I'm bug fixing at the moment, then I'll be working on status updates  
and activity feeds. I was probably going to tackle it when I moved  
back to the friends component for the next version.

It'd be awesome if you or any developers on the list could tackle some  
of this. I'd imagine that the built in wp_mail() function could be  
used, and email settings could be stored as usermeta.

> Also, I would love to see the emails configurable in terms of

I'd like to bring the back-end "Account" tab into the theme. So  
introduce an "Account" menu item on the navigation. Here the user  
could configure their email settings, account email/password and in  
the future their privacy settings.

Any help is much appreciated, and the same goes to anyone else reading  
this - just let me know what you want to work on, and I'll make sure  
it's not being done already.

Cheers
Andy

Check if GD libraries are installed on your server.
Just upload a page with <?php php_info(); ?> on your server, access it and
look for GD
good luck

Thanks for the info. Perhaps I should rephrase my question a little bit:

Can somebody tell me where I can find the SVN trunk of WPMU? It would
be nice to be able to download the official WPMU POT file.

I can't find any language files for the Buddypress in it's SVN, may I
conclude from that all text strings are hard coded?

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Buddypress theme in IE
Message-ID: <48D17F62.9060003@gmail.com>

Hi, I've noticed that the buddypress theme has some issues when viewed 
in IE. Especially IE6 but also IE7. The profile column is very narrow 
and in IE6 there is a big gap between the Basic Profile title bar and 
the basic profile info... Of course, the drop-downs don't work in IE6 (I 
assume they need the hover fix added). I'll fix this if it isn't fixed 
by the time I get to that part of my project (next week probably).

Also, I'm assuming that it will be possible to create custom buddypress 
themes once the api is stable? I'm not sure if the approach with the 
admin bar being in the bp-core is conducive to separating presentation 
from code. Maybe this could be moved to the theme's function.php file or 
made into a separate plugin/component? I assume that this is due to the 
early stage in BuddyPress development and that it will be dealt with at 
some point :).


My concerns are that I'm trying to find a way to manage frequent 
Buddypres updates in the context of my project where I do need to 
customise at least the theme's CSS styles and logos. It would be great 
if there was a provision made soon to enable custom buddypress themes to 
be installed.

Thanks Andy for all the good work on this.

Cheers,
Robert

Hi,
We am trying to install Buddypress at http://invokingeros.com. We first installed WPMU on the site [not in a directory]. It has been setup to use subdirectories rather than subdomains as it is on godaddy hosting. We can add users, blogs, posts, comments so WPMU appears to be running correctly as required by Buddypress. We added the latest stable version of buddypress but it does not appear to be fully running. We have a Buddypress and Profile in the Site Admin dashboard but never saw the Create Home Base tab. So when logged in using the website we only see an "edit this entry" message in each screen except blog, but does it nothing. We're unable to figure out what is wrong here and would appreciate any help in diagnosing the problem [or problems] and what we try next.
Thanks
Dave

The "official" download doesn't have the latest home base changes in it. 
You will need to download the SVN version for the home base stuff here: 
http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk. There is a readme file 
explaining the steps to install buddypress.

HTH.

Are you using the trunk version? I'd give that a shot if you are not.

I've done zero browser testing on the theme other than Firefox, so no  
doubt it will be a mangled mess in IE. If you feel like giving the CSS  
a polish, please do.

Yes, you can do it right now if you only modify the CSS. Once all of  
the template files are added (still need templates for activity,  
status updates and the photo gallery) you can even change any of the  
HTML, as long as you keep the ID's consistent.

I'd like to hear peoples opinions on this one. Personally I think the  
bar should be there by default (with a site admin option to switch it  
off). The idea is that it will be there no matter what blog theme or  
page you are viewing. It keeps a consistent way to get back to  
BuddyPress features. If you remove the bar, there is no way of quickly  
getting back to your own profile or any other BuddyPress screen.

> I assume that this is due to the early stage in BuddyPress

It's more that it's further down the list. My priority at the moment  
is to get the first version of all the components out there (possibly  
apart from the gallery stuff). Then go back through sharpen up all  
these parts.

Honestly, if you create a custom CSS file, @import() that at the top  
of the style.css and make your modifications, you will have no  
problems. You can just drop your customizations back in every time you  
update the theme.

I was thinking the built in gallery functionality, but I'm not sold on  
any particular way yet. If people know of really solid gallery plugins  
that could be used, feel free to drop links in a reply.

Ok, no problem. It's not a biggie, I'm sure.

Great, that sounds fine to me. What I meant also is the ability to 
install additional themes and use those. I think you mentioned in your 
README that it's not advisable to rename the buddypress theme directory. 
I've searched through the code and the buddypress theme folder only came 
up in 2 places.

I understand this and the option of turning the admin bar off would be 
great. I guess that, in conjunction with the ability to create a custom 
BP theme should be sufficient to keep people happy. Theme creators can 
then add the necessary navigation to the theme as desired.

Ok great. This should work for me at this stage, thanks for the 
assurance. If you're interested in taking a look at my current project 
in progress, I will be able to post a URL soon, when I get to a 
presentable point with the features :).

Message-ID: <e3cd39280809180615y5cd0b63bn67d4611ff06d56ad@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've just installed WPMU 2.6.1 and BuddyPress from svn.  I tested WPMU
before installing BP and it was working fine. Prior to installing BP,
I created a new blog and the blog was read/writeable.

However, after installing the BP plugins and theme, the blog is no
longer readable. I just get a blank page:
http://social.josswinn.org/josswinn/

This is the second time it's happened to me (I did a reinstall,
thinking I hadn't checked WPMU thoroughly enough before).

http://social.josswinn.org/josswinn/wp-admin works fine as does my
profile page http://social.josswinn.org/joss

I have WP and WPMU running fine on this (Dreamhost) server, so I'm
sure PHP and Apache are set up to run WPMU properly.

Any thoughts?

Thank you
Joss

Do you have the default Kubrick theme installed? I had the same issue,
and it was just because that theme was missing. If you don't, and
would like to default to something else, you just need to edit the
theme properties that you do have installed to make a default.

BuddyPress themes!

Hello,

Just a couple of suggestions on how I think the wording of the INSTALL
file can be improved:

* To use BuddyPress, your WPMU installation **MUST BE INSTALLED IN THE
ROOT [of your domain or sub-domain]**.
BuddyPress will not currently work when WPMU is installed a sub directory.

* Head to /wp-content/themes/ and backup the existing /home/
directory. Once you have it
backed up remove the /home/ directory from /wp-content/themes/

[it's not clear from this README why you need to backup but then
remove the vanilla home theme. What's more important is setting the
default theme to be 'BuddyPress Home Theme' or otherwise a user's blog
is a blank page. The Admin needs to activate the BuddyPress Home Theme
in Site Admin/Themes, so a user can see the theme they are using. I'm
not 100% sure how the site admin selects the default blog theme for
new users, but it didn't default to the BuddyPress Home Theme for me
on two installs.]

Cheers
Joss

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Adding items to home base dashboard with BP
Message-ID: <48D2E0FA.3020508@gmail.com>

Hi Andy,

for my current project, I need to give members the option to specify an 
external blog if they have one and my client's requirements are that 
their external blog is integrated into the site in terms of latest posts 
etc. which I plan on grabbing from the blog's RSS feed. Now, I'm looking 
for the best way to implement the administration of this field.

One idea is to use the normal BuddyPress profile fields but then it 
would be difficult to create some custom logic around the admin of that 
as I want to provide a button to discover the RSS feed and verify it etc.

The other idea is to write a custom plugin that provides a menu item on 
the Home Base dashboard called "External Blog" and do all my custom 
stuff there which would be perfect. Now, I see that buddypress hijacks 
the normal WP dashboard rendering and does it's own thing so the 
question is, how can I hook into that and add my own menu item and code 
the actions for it? Can I still use the add_menu_page() function for 
this or do I have to do something else?

Thanks,
Robert

You can still use all the normal functions for adding menu items. It  
only hijacks the blog specific tabs. Adding custom tabs should be no  
problem and function as normal.

There are no language files yet, but the text strings are not  
hardcoded. If anyone knows how to generate language files and handle  
that side of things, shoot a reply!

Hi phlux0r,

Did you read that page? That page is useless without a POT file.

Hi Andy,

Thanks for the link and the info.

If the text isn't hard coded and there aren't language files, where
does it get it's text messages, shouldn't they be stored in some kind
of PHP file?

Yes, I read it. The POT file needs to be created. As far as I understand 
it, one will need to search through the buddypress code for _e() and 
__() functions and extract the strings into the POT file. After that, 
you can follow the steps in the translation guide.

Of course, BP will keep changing and this will need to be revisited on a 
regular basis (unless Andy starts maintaining a POT file for Buddypress).

Regards,
Robert

Ah that explains a lot, thanks.

Do you know if there are scripts/tools to extract these strings and
make a pot file?

It would indeed be nice if Andy starts maintaining a pot file. That
would make our live a little bit easier.

Hm, I don't know of such scripts, you might want to do some web searches 
on this topic. Alternatively, some code editing IDEs will allow you to 
search multiple files.

If you're using Linux, some clever use of regular expressions and sed or 
some python code could do the trick... you could write a utility in php 
too :)...

Sorry I can't help much more, I haven't had the need to get into 
translating anything for Wordpress yet.

Robert

You might want to join the WordPress  polyglots mailing list
http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-polyglots where the
mainstream WordPress translators hang out.

They must have scripts and tools to help you.

I think we need to add this to all strings

|<?php _e('Not Found','buddypress');?>

I tried that before and it works but i gave up cause of all coding changes. So what we need is to get this into the trunk...

Have you tried Poedit? It's quite easy to use.

Also read this discussion on the Wordpress MU forums.
Read this http://mu.wordpress.org/forums/topic.php?id=4913

PS: If you have done a Dutch translation I would love to see your POT
files as I would like to do an Afrikaans version.

I was wondering about this. I'll do a big sweep through and add  
'buddypress' everywhere I can see needs it. I will probably miss some  
though, so keep your eyes peeled! :)

Hi Andy,
I admire the work at Buddypress, and look forward to incorporate it in my
next web-venture. I was wondering if we can have a video plugin for
Buddypress user-profile & groups.
There are a handful of existing video plugins that integrate YouTube,
Metacafe, etc to WordpressMU. Can we hack any of them and hook it to
Buddypress user profiles & groups.


Cheers

Hey,
The ability to add custom fields for user profiles is awesome. It would be
equally handy if the Groups page has a few custom fields too.

At the least, can the Groups page have a couple more standard fields so that
we can edit the template to pseudo-customize them.

I basically wanted to add Categories and Tags to Group profiles. Thus, I can
display groups filtered based on Categories.

Cheers

I'm using Site5.com to host Ylber.org the community I'm launching. To  
use wordpress mu and Buddypress you need a Webhost that supports  
subdomains and wildcard (I don't know what it is, but you need it to  
use Buddypress). Site5 has wildcard support and it doesn't cost a lot  
of money.

I would recommend you to create the po file manually, and then just
import it into a web based social translating utility like
http://narro.i18n.ro/narro_project_list.php
(Romanian team has imported recently the WordPress project to it, and
I suppose bbPress is also on it's way there)
To do that, just email Alex Szasz and ask for some support, I'm sure
he'll be glad to help.
Here's his email: alexxed@gmail.com

One of the pluses to use a web based social translation utility is the
fact that you won't ever need to update the po file's once the project
has updates (of course if so, it has to be synced with svn repo or
what is it) and secondly, you will always be opened for help from
anybody from anywhere and all of this without any language frontiers.

Good luck!

I decided to go with Future Hosting (futurehosting.biz). They have VPS. In
my opinion VPS is excellent and future hosting seems to have a great
reputation and is well priced.. They have some great specials on their site
for hosting.. Can?t give you any major experiences thus far, but so far they
have great support and the speed is fantastic.

Message-ID: <DD3A8052-DB9D-4E26-8EE4-061CF2DF14BD@fyneside.com>

Hi,

I have a working fresh install of wpmu (tested etc.) uploaded the  
plugins into mu-plugins as instructions, chmod the wp-contents folder  
etc etc. Symptoms:

1. Adding a group fails. "There was an error saving the group. Please  
try again"
2. Create a Home Base results in a blank page. (which reminds me of  
how WP fails when the theme is installed but broken)
3. So I check out the Themes page and find that both of the BuddyPress  
themes are broken. Both style sheets are "unreadable" which is an  
error I have never had before. I have uploaded the themes repeatedly,  
and even checked the sizes of the files to ensure that its all there  
(it is).

This is all using the latest version of the trunk.

I am sure this is a basic newbie config. error, so any help would much  
appreciated.

Best Charles

It is likely a permissions issue. Roll chmod through the theme folder,
matching the permissions to what your other themes are.

Well pointed Brian, a vps is the best hosting solution you can afford
for a BuddyPress based community start-up.
Although I would recommend you to look for a vps at http://www.slicehost.com/

Currently I own services at several vps providers (including VPSlink
and even a russian vps provider), but Slicehost is the best one can
get!

Good luck!

I use Futurehosting's VPS as well. I found them to be very responsive
and helpful especially when setting up wildcard subdomains.

Hello!

I'm receiving this error repeatedly: "WordPress database error Table
'powerlinks_dev.wp__options' doesn't exist for query SELECT * FROM
wp__options WHERE option_name = 'siteurl' made by get_blog_option"

Also, my search for friends function does not seem to be working. It is not
returning any errors but is also not displaying any results.

Thanks,
Paul

Subject: [buddypress-dev] bp-activity
Message-ID: <1121FA58-E19A-4712-AC96-DCCCC9163E9A@automattic.com>

The new activity component is in now in trunk. The activity component  
shows an activity stream for the logged in user and also all the  
friends of the logged in user. Users can also view other users activity.

You can also view the latest on http://testdrivewpmu.com (http://andy.testdrivewpmu.com 
  as an example without signing up).

Handling of navigation items and action handling have also been  
modified in this revision.

In previous revisions you had to modify the navigation arrays  
directly, and also use a "bp_[component]_catch_action" function. This  
was messy and made it difficult for components to be extended in third  
party plugins.

Four new functions are now available:

bp_core_add_nav_item()
  - Details here: http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk/bp-core.php#L508

bp_core_add_subnav_item()
  - Details here: http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk/bp-core.php#L546

bp_core_add_nav_default()
  - Details here: http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk/bp-core.php#L600

bp_core_reset_subnav_items()
  - Details here: http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk/bp-core.php#L585

Also added is a new template file in the default theme (plugin- 
template.php) which will let plugins easily display information within  
the actual theme. This means new components could be added without  
creating new template files, and existing BuddyPress components could  
be easily extended.

Code example here:
http://codex.buddypress.org/extending-components/

Cheers
Andy

Subject: [buddypress-dev] New sign-up emails - customising the wording
Message-ID: <48D9E7EF.1080806@gmail.com>

Hi Andy,

just wondering if there's a way to change the wording on the welcome 
emails when a user signs up for the first time. They receive a profile 
only so the email's default wording of "blog" is misleading. 
Unfortunately, this email is sent from wpmu-functions.php and, if 
possible, I'd like to avoid hacking this file. Besides, when the same 
user subsequently creates a blog, then the default wording is fine as 
they are creating a blog.

Cheers,
Robert

Message-ID: <7E0958F0-6D32-494C-9708-99073E75E8D8@automattic.com>

The new BuddyPress site is now up and running at: http://buddypress.org

The latest version now includes forums for project discussions. The  
mailing list will still remain, but I'd like to keep it more as a  
developer list rather than general support.

There are still a few things to fix on the site, (IE support!) plus  
the new codex theme will not be live until tomorrow.

Hopefully this will give people a better idea about what the project  
has and will have to offer. The old site was sadly out of date, it's  
amazing how much things have progressed over the last 6 months. Thanks  
for everyone's feedback, it has really helped push the project in the  
right direction.

Cheers
Andy

Is this something that's planned? I had wondered, too.


Thanks

Subject: [buddypress-dev] BuddyPress theme development
Message-ID: <60fe160a0809291548o3c36e56bibc18df8dcbe300c5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've coded the beginnings of a new theme for BuddyPress:
http://buddypress.stillbreathing.co.uk/wp-content/themes/dark/profile.html.
Obviously there's quite a bit to do with blogs, groups etc, but I'm
quite pleased so far.

However I think quite a lot could be done to make the theme code
better, so the use of HTML and CSS is easier and more intuitive - and
so it lends itself to increasing levels of complexity. I've had to
change a couple of bits in the HTML of the profile page as I didn't
want to spend hours hacking CSS! So it was obvious to me that the end
HTML could be more flexible.

I'd be happy to spend a bit of time with the theme making sure that
the class names and IDs are put together in such a way to make style
writing a bit easier. I'll almost certainly base the revised theme on
the Blueprint CSS framework (http://www.blueprintcss.org/) as it gives
lots of flexibility with layout. I guess that many users of BP won't
want to write a full theme, just amend the CSS for the default one (as
the theme is a lot more complex than a standard WP one). I'd also
build in a load of microformat goodness, in the same way that Sandbox
(http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/) have.

The idea is that if the default theme has all the flexibility and
power built in that people could want, they'll be much more likely to
feel able to try out BuddyPress. Lowering the barrier of entry is a
Good Thing.

So, any thoughts?

Chris

Chris,

Looking good, definitely take a look at the structure of the HTML.  
I've been building it in bits as I go along, so no doubt a lot could  
be done to improve it. The only thing to watch is some ID's are use in  
the JS for AJAX functionality. Pagination and lists especially.

Anything that makes it easier for users to style a theme, the better.  
Microformats would be great, I'd like to get those in the default too.

Nice work!
Andy

Ciao tutti!
Well..  Yes, I'm already search in the archive list about this topic, but...
Any plans to get the "textdomain" working like Liang[1] say?

_e("text"), it is better to use _e("text", "buddypress");

Regards,
Felipe.
