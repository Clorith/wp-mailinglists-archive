Subject: [buddypress-dev] Why not a menu bar?

The latest versions of buddypress are now full of features. But one I  
miss is a menubar to display some static pages someone would use to  
introduce the project or the community to his audience,with a page for  
features, an "about" page, eventually a pricing page or anything else.  
I know I could do this by myself, but believe when I tell you that I  
can't because I don't know how to do it.

Thank you
Margarit

I'm posting this here because there doesn't seem to be an answer for  
this in the forum.
I'm getting "Error 404 - Not Found" on the news and the blog pages on  
my Bp install. I'm also getting some problem in the members area, if  
you click on a letter it starts loading but nothing happens.
I'm pretty sure I have mu installed correctly. It is installed on a  
shared server if that could be the problem?
Any suggestions? I really want to start styling this site.
You can see it here.

be download links on the site sometime this afternoon.

Hi guys,
I uploaded the new version of wordpress mu 2.7 from the trunk and did  
the same for the buddypress pack.
In wordpress Mu dashboard when I try to click on "users" and then on  
"Account ettings" it gives me this error:
Cannot load bp-xprofile/admin-mods/bp-xprofile-account-tab.php.



Thank you
margarit

I just installed a new/fresh copy of wp mu and the package for

I'm not quite sure what I did wrong. Any tips or ideas? You can see

I apologize for my previous post. I cleaned it all out and
re-installed, and I believe that last time I put the files into
plugins instead of mu-plugins.

Thanks,
Brett

Hey everybody -

I've got a BP site up and running, so I'm confused as to why a fresh  
local install is giving me 404 page not found errors -

BP components are in mu-plugins folder

groups, profiles, everything is giving me an error

maybe it is just too early in the AM for me to figure out, but man am  
I stumped.

Set the permissions on all BuddyPress files to 755.

Message-ID: <d579b8660812211712l46d56f8bq31a746377c82dce7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, guys.

I have posted a ticket about the 'time since' strings on member widget not
displaying correctly, and submit a patch to correct this [0]. But, as I
wrote in the trac ticket, it also interfered with WordPress bug [1] that I
found when investigating this buddypress problem.. Could someone with commit
access have a look at the ticket? I posted it in WordPress trac, not WPMU.
Not sure whether it would be considered double posting or not if I also
posted it in WPMU bug tracker. But we're using WPMU, and WPMU still doesn't
have the final 2.7 release yet. Is there any chance it can be merged with
2.7?

There are other part of the buddypress code that is dependent to this 'time
since' function. So any change to the function will affect and possibly
break the others. I'll help looking through them all and correct them. But
first I want to be sure that my patch is correct and will be merge in 2.7 or
it should wait until  2.7.1?

Yes, Burt. I know the URL. Thank you. But not sure is it right to post
ticket to both WP & WPMU, since WPMU's code are mostly taken from WP.

But, ok. I think I'll post it to make it sure it'll be merged, or at least
reviewed before 2.7 final.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Some more translation questions
Message-ID: <31fae6190812230504v11e19611ne45a8e72d16096e9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

In September I have asked a few questions on how I could localize
BuddyPress, I figured out how things are working and it looks like I got the
hang of it.
However I do have a few small questions:


   - Is it possible to easily reuse the WP language file in WPMU? When I
   tried to use the WP file as a starting point and updated it with the php
   code I'm loosing a lot of the translations :-(
   - Is it possible to use multiple Language files? At the moment I got the
   impression that I need to have 1 file, containing all the translations. I
   think it would be more convenient to have seperate language files, each part
   (like WPMU, buddypress, bbpress, etc) having it's own language file.

I have asked these questions to the people involved in the dutch translation
of WP, but they aren't responding at all, so that's why I'm bothering you
with these questions.

Happy Holidays,

Kind regards,

Florin
