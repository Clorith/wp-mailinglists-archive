Hey Guys,

We are thinking about integrating buddypress with www.getshopped.com and 
I was wondering whether or not this would be a good forum to talk about 
it.  We really want to start by brainstorming. Here or privately - but 
preferably here in the sense that we could all learn something and talk 
about how buddypress could effect the future of e-commerce in the 
greater sense.
 
If you take a look at getshopped.com which is an e-commerce site builder 
(built using WordPress MU and the WP e-Commerce plugin) how do you guys 
think that shop owners could benefit by adding BuddyPress to the mix.

What comes to my mind is the ability for people that sell the same stuff 
to network with one another. Plus the ability for those people to sell 
things on behalf of others in their own territories and earn referral 
dollars. But I'm not sure what else and I am very keen to explore and 
learn more about this space...

Ciao,

Dan

I must have completely missed this buddymoney idea back in April.  
Sounds like great idea to me. I can help out with answers, advice and  
core fixes. :)

Hi Andy,

That is great news. I think that the plan should be to setup a new site 
called buddymoney.org (I just bought the domain name) where people can 
go to and buy tokens. It occurs to me that essentially we would be 
building a payment gateway of sorts. Think along the lines of Google 
Checkout meets BuddyPress.

In theory anybody could goto buddymoney.org (or buddypress.org) and buy 
tokens that can be spent on a site that has the BuddyMoney plugin installed.

Shall I email you my initial sketches / design mock up?

Ciao,

Dan

I am also very interested in this matter. I am lurking the mailing list
quite a while now, but this is a development I really want to support this,
I have also a domain registered for it, called buddymoney.eu.

How do I get off this list, I tried the unsubscribe but evidently it doesn't
work?

I've now changed the URL structure of BuddyPress so it is a little  
more intuitive.

All member pages are now at:

http://domain.com/members/[username]

All blogs continue to function on either a subdomain or subdirectory  
depending on your settings.

This also means that pseudo-blogs/home bases are no longer needed for  
users. Because this is now the case, the original "give me a blog/just  
a username" option is now honored on the sign up page. Users can  
either just sign up for an account, or an account and their first blog.

The changes should not break existing installations, however you may  
get some redundant tables and users will need to re-upload their avatar.

Cheers
Andy

That's great Andy, it makes *much* more sense now.

Thanks for this.


Is the "/members/"  part configurable? I'm thinking different
languages, or even /buddies/, /homies/, /sisters/

Hey,

Great news. I have allready blogged it:
http://buddypress.de/blog/2008/10/aenderung-der-url-struktur.html - It's
German ;)

Btw.: Andy can you build the textdomain load function in, we need it for the
german translation of BuddyPress.

Hi Peter,

I am going to start by putting together a website where people can 
purchase buddymoney tokens. What I'll do is think about an API and some 
documentation for people to use.

Perhaps we could provide you a list of things to do and you could try 
creating a buddymoney donate plugin or help us to get it working with WP 
e-Commerce.

I am kind of over whelmed at the moment. So I'm not sure whether that 
sounds like a plan or not. I would really really like to have Andy's 
thoughts on core infrastructure...

Ciao,

Hi guys,
I just updated buddypress files with the latest version on the trunk  
and I have to say that I love the new structure of the membres and  
news page.
But I'm havin some problems. I can't see the avatars of my users and  
even if i try to upload a new avatar it doesn't work. What does it mean?
What should I do? I already encountered this problem and I solved it  
uninstallin all Wordpress MU e installing it again. I don't want to do  
that again.
Help!
Thank you.

I am having the same problem with my install. When creating new user
accounts, and while trying to adapt existing user accounts.

That is a fair question. I would not have known the answer to that back 
when we first started mucking around with e-commerce either.

I think there are probably a few good answers but following is the most 
important one. There are so so so so so (did I say so) so many WordPress 
users in the world that live in countries that don't support Paypal it 
is not even funny. These people deserve a one stop shop approach that 
works no matter where they are from.

I want to do this because I want to see something even easier then 
Paypal that works regardless of where you are. I think that something 
done right "the wordpress way" will kick butt and I'm keen to be a part 
of that and get the ball rolling. For the person that does not want it 
or does not fancy using buddymoney then they would just keep using 
Paypal (etc) and that is equally cool. Whatever floats your boat baby ;))

It is a big small world out there I think there is still plenty of room 
to do something cool in this space. So I will... with the help of others :P

Have a nice weekend everybody (yay it is now Friday night in NZ)!!!

Ciao,

Dan

I'll be debugging this today and will hopefully have a fix checked in  
a bit later. You won't need to reinstall.

Hi Dan,

Good answer.  I have always found that the way tyo get someone 
interested in an idea is to have a good reason WHY they want it, and 
that's a good reason.  Again though, you will need to get up a good 
write-up in a couple of paragraphs as to why this is a good idea for 
EVERYone ;)  Try and get those that would stay with PayPal THE reason to 
move over to Buddymoney.

Unfortunately, many people dont care too much about the countries that 
don't support PayPal and you could slap them in the face with a wet 
haddock and they still wouldn't get it LOL  and you do want them too....

Andy,

When someone tries to sign up to the site, they are managing to get all 
the way to the last stage, then when they click to actually get their 
username and blog it is taking them back to the first page telling them 
they MUST fill out a first and last name.

I have tested it and they are correct, it is just looping back to that 
page again.

Welcome to pre-release software! Make sure you are using subversion,  
otherwise you're going to be downloading and uploading a lot. :)

I've seen this happen. I believe it has to do with the
IE incompatibility issues.

Here is an idea how about adding a hook that adds a link to all blog

to the authors profile page??
I added one manually if you want to check out what i mean...

Try to delete an avatar... no go, nothing happens

Try to upload a new or replacement avatar, even when none there already, 
and it says that you must upload one over 150 x 150 pixels.  We are.
So avatars are bust.

Last time we tried was 435 and they didnt work then either, but they did 
work in the one before that

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Bad possibilities to translate BuddyPress
Message-ID: <5d70d5290810270038n7b61df84h5a8450f69efd8bf8@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

we are at buddypress.de hard working on a perfect translation of the best
software. But we can't, because the possibilities to translate BuddyPress
are really bad. The function bp_core_time_since, which makes the
representation of the time elapsed, simply adds a 's' if the number not one.
In this case it would be better to use __ngettext.

The next problem is, that buddypress use for example for the localization of
"registered 3 hours, 9 minutes ago" 2 strings! It would be better use one
string with a %s. This would be better to translate.

I hope my suggestions will be flow in into the trunk.

Thanks, your Dennis.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Problem with widget on 0.4 BP
Message-ID: <4909b6e4.0ac0100a.026d.6c67@mx.google.com>

Hi, 

 

I have a problem with the Design > Widget page. If I select a column
different of "left-column" and try to add a widget, this widget go to the
"left-column" and not to the colum that I have defined! How can I solve
this? 

 

thanks for support,

Igor

Hi all,
is this OK, that pending friend requests are visible to anyone 
(guests/anonymous as well)?
http://testbp.org/members/buzzlightyear/friends/requests/friends/requests

Shouldn't it be visible only to logged in user for whom those requests are?

thanx
buzz
