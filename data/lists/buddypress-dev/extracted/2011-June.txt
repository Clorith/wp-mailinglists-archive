Subject: [buddypress-dev] [BuddyPress] How to detect if an user has never
	logged in
Message-ID: <BANLkTin7S1zRgoMK4ZjCuV5Mg=wscmEnnA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi friends,

I'm developing a particular social network where the users are
pre-registered and only after that they receive an invitation to join
the social network. If they accept they can log in and become members.
In order to do so, I need to display only the users that have logged
in at least one time and hide the others.

My question is very simple: how can I detect if a registered user
never logged in? It would be very useful to insert this filter in the
members loop.

Thanks

Hi friends,

I would know if in BuddyPress there is some function or some plugin
that allow me to automatically add an user to a group. I need that
because it's an important function of my work-flow.

If there aren't, could someone post here a sample code to do that?

Thanks

If a user has logged in at least once, there will be a *last_activity* key
in the wp_usermeta table for that user. At one point, users without that key
didn't appear in the members loop, though that may have changed.

I've got sample code that does just that at
http://www.ethitter.com/tips-tricks/2010/11/automatically-add-new-users-to-a-buddypress-group/.
In this example, the user is added automatically after activating his/her
new account, but hooking the sample code to a different action that provides
a user ID (such as a login action) will produce the desired result.

Hey,
you should take a look at `groups_join_group()` and
`groups_leave_group()`

Here's a snippet that should help you:

When a user logs in, his BuddyPress profile is generated. Once a user
profile was generated, it's entry will be listed in
`bp_core_get_users()` results. So basically, querying
`bp_core_get_users()` you will get all the BuddyPress users.

If you want to make it even better, you can also check the User object
attributes `user_registered` and `last_activity`.

Hi

Checking for last_activity is the most reliable way to go, but only in BP v1.3. In 1.2, that key is made when the user activates their account.

I tweaked the behaviour for 1.3 so that it only creates it, for the first time, when the user logs in. 

Regards
Paul Gibbs

Taking a look at this URL
http://www.ethitter.com/tips-tricks/2010/11/automatically-add-new-users-to-a-buddypress-group/
I've noticed that there is an interesting action called
"bp_core_activated_user".

I think it could be the action executed when the buddypress profile of
an user is created for the first time, in my case the first time an
user logs in.

What do you think about?

Thanks

That action is called when a new user activates his/her account via
BuddyPress' activation mechanism. It won't execute again for a given user
after that user activates his/her account.

You can find that action in the *bp_core_activate_signup* function of
BuddyPress' *bp-core/bp-core-signup.php* file.

The main problem is that when the admin creates an user from admin
area he's automatically considered an active user.
So my question is: "How can I detect if an user never logged in?" Is
there an option in the database containing this information?

Thanks
