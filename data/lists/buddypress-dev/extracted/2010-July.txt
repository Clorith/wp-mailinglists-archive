Subject: [buddypress-dev] "Find the shortest connection between two
	members"-feature
Message-ID: <4C4010AA.9000405@zoranzaric.de>

Hello everybody,

i'm writing a "find the shortest connection between two
members"-feature. I'd like to test it's performance. Can anybody with a
BIG real world installation provide me a dump of his wp_bp_friends, please?

Kind Regards,
Zoran

You might want to contact the owner of hotforwords.com she's friendly, and
they've got 50K members. Look for her on the buddypress.org forums.

Our dev team is working on a similar function that analyzes relationships
between keywords assigned to images to discover which keywords are related
to each other. You might be able to re-use a lot of our code when we get it
finished.

Keep an eye on our plugin project:

thanks a lot, I'll contact her.

I already implemented the feature in PHP5. Just want to test if the
algorithm is appropriate for buddypress and then back port it to PHP4 /
buddypress/wordpres coding guidlines.

Nice.

Well if you have your code posted anywhere, I'd love to have a look at it.
One of the great things about open source is the ability to check out how
other people have implemented things and learn from their work.

Thanks!

-Carl
