I was playing around with a single forum. I haven't looked into groups having multiple forums.. yet?

I'm not sure about the best way to implement it (sorry, not the response you were looking for), but if you do decide to move forward, let me know if I can be of any help.

>> One thing I see very often on the BuddyPress forums is people getting their heads around the concept of how forums are provided within groups, and that a typical "open" forum doesn't exist. Surely this is a great idea for a  plugin.  How do you think this is best done -- create, say, a public group and hook into BuddyPress so it isn't displayed in the group directory, etc? Another way I can see is to create a new record in wp_bb_forums but I imagine the BP group directory would iterate through the records and try to find a group based on the forum_name; what happens if it fails?
