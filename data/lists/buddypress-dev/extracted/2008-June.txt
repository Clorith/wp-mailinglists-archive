Message-ID: <1C323AB7-0280-4C4B-9DAB-A31238923A9E@automattic.com>

I've put together a Google calendar for the BuddyPress development  
timeline.

The start and end dates are based on only me working on components,  
they do not take into account contributions from the community. This  
basically means that any contributions and work done by others will  
speed up the timeline.

You can subscribe to the calendar with the following links:

  * XML: http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/46c3sjdmpi9gribubnk0gaa19o%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic
  * ICAL: http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/46c3sjdmpi9gribubnk0gaa19o%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
  * HTML: http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=46c3sjdmpi9gribubnk0gaa19o%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles

Cheers,

I'm not sure there is a really easy way of doing this right now. The  
best way would be to create a function that takes in the field name as  
a parameter, then returns the value. That way you don't have to loop  
through everything just to find one value.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Getting Custom Field Values
Message-ID: <20080611082352.fuaeobehgko0c0ws@www.dimensionmedia.com>

Hi all,

I wanted to share this function I built in  
bp-xprofile-templatetags.php which allows one to grab custom profile  
values.

function get_field_value($fieldname, $output_field_name = false,  
$dropdown = false) {
	global $profile_template;
	foreach ($profile_template->groups as $group) {
		foreach ($group->fields as $field) {
			if ($field->name == $fieldname && $field->data->value != '') {

				if ($output_field_name) {
					return $field->name . ": " . $field->data->value;
				} else {
					return $field->data->value;
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

This works for single-value profile values such as textboxes and  
select dropdowns. Looking for ways to improve the function when it  
comes to multiple-value values which would look like this in the  
output (assuming the values "online" and "local" are selected):

a:2:{i:0;s:6:"Online";i:1;s:5:"Local";}

Regardless, the above function I hope is a step in the right direction.

It literally isn't defined yet. :) It's just a place holder for when  
actual admin controlled settings are created.

I've been working on a new default BuddyPress theme for the past week  
or so.

The current theme is just for testing purposes and really doesn't  
achieve anything. The new theme will make use of all the BuddyPress  
functionality and will hopeful provide theme designers with a theme to  
copy and paste code from. It'll include all the new BuddyPress  
template tags.

I've explained more on the actual gallery page, so it's best to head  
over there and take a look.

Hi Jed, don't know if you got this sorted out alrady, but seems like  
your normal WP uploads directory isn't writable. You'll want to make  
wp-content/blogs.dir/ writable by the web server, and that should fix  
that problem hopefully.

the theme looks beautiful..
i'd like to know if options are being considered for making not just
'friends' but also 'fans' - which don't require a confirmation.  This is
especially helpful in news type social networks where you are bookmarking an
article, favoriting or becoming a fan of an author, or rating an article
up/down ala digg.  I'm thinking of these features along the lines of Movable
Type's Community Solution, which HuffingtonPost.com and Gothamist use to
good effect.

Seems there were troubles with the list software yesterday, so some  
emails are coming through multiple times.

This is great, but the trouble I see is that you are having to loop  
through everything to find the value you want. That is expensive.

What I've done is created a function that will query the DB for the  
specific values you want. This should be *a lot* faster.

I'm going to check the function into the trunk later today, it can be  
used as follows:

bp_get_field_data( $field_names [, $user_id] );

$field_names = Either a string containing the name of the field, or an  
array of field names.
$user_id = Optional. This will default to the id for the current user  
being viewed, or you can pass an id for a specific user.

The function will return a string containing the field value if you  
only pass one field. It will return an array of values with the field  
name as the key if you pass an array of field names.

Examples:

<?php echo bp_get_field_data( 'First Name' ); ?>

<?php
   $profile_data = bp_get_field_data( array( 'First Name', 'Last  
Name', 'Home Town' ) );
   echo 'First Name: ' . $profile_data['First Name'];
   echo 'Last Name: ' . $profile_data['Last Name'];
   echo 'Home Town: ' . $profile_data['Home Town'];
?>

That should hopefully satisfy the need to select and render specific  
profile fields rather than just looping them all.

I may include this function in a 0.3.3 release of extended profiles.

unserialize() will do that.

Groups and Friends are not ready to be integrated because there are some errors. Should I wait until they are ready to be integrated with other components? With your new theme, I am hoping to see them all ready soon but apparently it will be couple more months before we see them all ready.

Let's say if I started a WPMU site with lots of new users until Buddypress is ready to roll out then how hard will it be integrated with current wpmu users. New theme will be taking over their own current design or will we see widgets instead to show my profile info, etc like we see on the new theme. If we could use the new theme as "stand alone" site under a wpmu site's author page. Let's say I am the blog owner of XYZ then a widget to show my author info/profile, etc. Anyone can click on it as profile page like myspace or others do. Will it be possible?

I installed BuddyPress: Extended Profiles today and receive the error below in comment posts. While searching for info about his error I did find some other sites that look like they are also giving this a try and having the same problem below. 

Warning:  constant() [function.constant]: Couldn't find constant XPROFILE_AVATAR_V32_W in /home/user/public_html/wp-content/mu-plugins/bp-xprofile/bp-xprofile-avatars.php on line 37

Anyone else have this issue or know how to fix/tweak this?

Hi to all!
As I can see,the whole project goes great!(Thanx to Andy and anyone else
who've helped and is still helping!)

BUT,I don't remember anything about the "subject" localization...
Will BP be available on other languages?...
If so,can we help to the translation?...
Thank you for your time!
Keep up!

Seems like that would almost be a buddypress plugin. That would be  
sweet...buddypress widgets to use with wp themes.

 From what I've seen in the code, all output is using WordPress'  
built in localization functions, so you should be able to create .MO  
files just like for WordPress for the BuddyPress UI and have it work  
the same way.

I don't actually know how you do that, but I know it's been done a  
lot for WP and BP looks like it will work the same way.

Exactly, we've used localization functions everywhere so language  
support should work the same way it does for WordPress.

Hi, Andy

Actually, since BuddyPress is more like a plugin for WPMU, the textdomain
probably should be different from the default WPMU. It simply means that
instead of

_e("text"), it is better to use _e("text", "buddypress");

This way, translators can do WPMU translation and BuddyPress translations
separately. And the buddypress translation can be made available for
download with the BuddyPress package.

Just my 2 cents. Once it is ready, Nikolay can probably setup an automatic
POT file generation script for BuddyPress as well. :)

Yes. Just disable new registrations in the Site Admin area of MU.

As we know, "Mutual Friends" and "People You May Know" are the important and
attractive features on Facebook, are they in our BuddyPress plan? I did not
see it on trac.buddypress.com yet so far, thanks!

I'm working on developing a buddypress site for some grad students and  
I'm running across the following issues:
-The theme, when placed in the /wp-content/themes/default folder can  
be activated but if fails to load (see this page: http://wpmu.thecorkboard.org/kyle/)
-The theme snapshot preview doesn't show in the admin section
-The ability to change my profile field options has disappeared

Any help would be great-

I've been making a lot of changes to the way the theme works. This  
includes changes to function names. It's likely that the old theme  
references old function names which throws an error.

I've just this morning checked in an early version of the new theme.  
I'm not ready to tag a downloadable version of it yet, so only people  
who know how to check out from the trunk should go ahead with this.

I'm working as fast as possible to get this new theme up and running.  
Once I do, I'll tag a version so people can begin to download and test  
and use it however they like.

Thanks
Andy

Hi,

We have the beginnings of a friend system but it needs a lot of work.
The good news is it should be fairly easy to show 'friends of friends'
and 'mutual friends'. I'm not sure how 'people you may know' works.
Can someone explain?

Chris

Scot-

I use Dreamhost and find it works quite well.  Easy to create  
databases and just drop the WPMU folder into a directory, then plug in  
the database name, host, and admin credentials.  Did it this morning,  
actually.

I would like to suggest that "people you may know" is unnecessary, it is in
theory attempting to guess-match you to people you may know based on profile
info and related friends, not an easy thing to do - and facebook has never
shown me someone I "may know".
I'm more hoping to allow people to be a fan of another author or member - a
fan doesn't have to be "confirmed", this way a fan can be kept abreast of
the author's latest blogs, comments, etc via the wire.  It is used to good
effect on 2.0 news sites that are increasingly resembling a social network.

sites recently.

Just some friendly advice - if the site is going to have a large number 
of users, you'll need to go with a VPS. I use futurehosting.biz.

 For very small installs, you can get away with shared hosting for a 
time, but MU usually winds up being a little more memory intensive when 
you get up over a couple hundred users.

We use slicehost.com and they have very good support.

They seem to be actively promoting best practices for running a big MU 
type of site - they even have tutorials on how to use nginx as a 
webserver as opposed to Apache.

Also its not just me using slicehost.com - here is a post from dougal 
who works on Wordpress:
http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/04/21/now-on-slicehost

Use the Debian install - do not use CentOS on slicehost.com because 
there are some seriously bad memory leaks happening. I could be wrong 
but I think wordpress.com uses Debian - and we figure it is best to do 
what they do - don't fix what isnt broke huh?

And with slicehost.com you can start small like us and increase your 
account size as you need to.

This is what I would do (learned from hours of pain):
- setup a debain slice at slicehost.com
- install MU
- off load your themes to amazon S3
- explore using nginx as a webserver

Using Amazon S3 to host your themes is a very very good idea. It will 
mean your slicehost account can stay smaller for longer. This is because 
S3 is doing a lot of the hard work with images. This is what 
wordpress.com does and this is what started to do on getshopped.com ever 
since we realised it meant we could save money and improve the user 
experience at the same time.

Don't think big. Think smart :))

The plugin you want for S3 is this one:

But with BuddyPress most sites will probably use only one or two themes. :)

I agree with Ponara, a one-way "fan" type designation is far more relevant
to a blog-specific SN, than FB which is designed to be an
acknowledgement-of-relationship tool.

I think having a system of one way relationships would be the way to go.
You could have people that are "Friends" where there are duel one-way
relationships and "Buddies" which are completely one way.  That would allow
people to be be connected and follow any one they want, along with the
ability to also have a pre-arranged whitelist if you don't want the world to
see anything.  A friend list could also have 3 sections: Friends, My Buddies
(people I follow) and Budies of mine (people following me).

If you have an existing account at testdrivewpmu.com, you'll need to  
login, hit the design tab, and activate the new BuddyPress theme.

It's coming along! It obviously has a massive amount of unfinished  
work right now, but give me a few more days... :)

Subject: [buddypress-dev] up/down commenters on buddypress
Message-ID: <a3e04a520806181214u770e4741he9ca28d334c80e89@mail.gmail.com>

Was wondering whether anyone is considering the ability to up/down comments.
A popular topic (politics, celebs, media, etc) usually attracts alot of
comments, unfortunately many are very rude,
the ability to thumbs down those comments so that better comments float to
the top is done in a few places and always appreciated.

Also simple linking the commenter to their profile page if they're members
so we can see their blogs, wire, etc. would create a virtuous cycle of
reading other people's posts.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Better way of doing this?
Message-ID: <000601c8d229$bb990940$32cb1bc0$@com>

Motivated by seeing Andy's screen shots of the new theme he is working on I
have started work on my own BuddyPress compatible theme, but I have hit a
problem that I have managed to solve but it required a change in the core
Wordpress MU code, which I was trying to avoid if at all possible.

 

First some background, I am working on a website that is running Wordpress
MU in non virtual host mode, so the blogs are www.domainname.com/blogname,
and want to allow for a user being an administrator on multiple blogs, and a
blog to have multiple authors. I decided that I wanted
www.domainname.com/members/username to show a user profile and list their
blogs and www.domainname.com/profile to show the current user. First problem
is that because I am not configured as a virtual host Wordpress MU tries to
create a blog called members or profile, I have managed to solve this by
changing a line in wpmu-settings.php from

$blognames = array( 'page', 'comments', 'blog', 'wp-admin', 'wp-includes',
'wp-content', 'files', 'feed' );

To

$blognames = array( 'page', 'comments', 'blog', 'wp-admin', 'wp-includes',
'wp-content', 'files', 'feed', 'members', 'profile' ); 

 

Is there a better way of getting Wordpress MU to allow this to go through?

 

For those of you that may want to do the same thing I then modified my
.htaccess and added the following lines to it:

RewriteRule ^.*/?members/(.*)/ /index.php?sn_action=member&sn_member=$1 [L]

RewriteRule ^.*/?profile/$ /index.php?sn_action=profile [L]

 

I'm far from being a mod rewrite expert, so someone may be able to suggest a
better way of doing this?

 

I then wrote a plug-in that looks for sn_action and includes a page from the
current template to display the information e.g.

 function member_redirect() {

  if (isset($_GET['sn_action'])) {

        $action = $_GET['sn_action']; 

            switch($action) {

          case 'member':

        if (isset($_GET['sn_member'])) {

          $sn_member = $_GET['sn_member'];

          if($template = get_query_template('member')) {

            include($template);

            exit;

          }

        }

            exit;

          break;  

...<snip>

 

add_action('template_redirect', 'member_redirect');

 

Again I am no expert at this there may be a better way?

 

All that remains to be done is to add a member.php etc. to the home
template. You can then modify the default template to show all author
information for the blog, with links to their profiles, instead of trying to
figure out who's profile to show for the current blog.

 

It will also allow me to add template changes so that a user can "follow" a
blog, but be a "friend" to a user.

 

Another problem I see with this method is the member URL is formed using the
login name of the user, I really don't want to make that publically
viewable, is there a way currently, or going to be a way in the future that
I can create a required field in XProfile that should be unique across all
users, so a user can enter what they want to be used for their URL?

 

I love where BuddyPress is going, and have enjoyed working on my own theme
for it, if any one wants more information on what I'm doing, let me know,

 

Martin

	seamlessly
Message-ID: <3f7bc4310806191048v1bd2676ble3484e1180df3605@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, All

Integrating wpmu frontend with backend theme seamlessly is a proved success
on my wpmu site, I implemented it by means of changing both backend theme
and default theme (on my site the user can only use the default theme, based
on my site's purpose and I will integrate buddypress on my site in future, I
have a good reason to do this) , to make the menus and navigation bars look
exactly same, so that the user won't feel any difference when they go to the
backend (admin site), the users of my site like it very much and gave me
many positive response.

The new BuddyPress theme is awesome! I plan to change to it when it is
completed, but the user will fell weird when they go to the backend and see
the default wpmu backend theme. I wonder if you guys working on this theme
have the plan to do the above wonderful things like I did? if yes, do you
have any design thoughts already? probably it need change the core files
since it need modify the backend theme as well, based on my experience,
design it earlier will save you a lot of time in future.

In the default theme, all the backend functionality will be ported  
through to the theme. Here's an example of editing your profile via  
the theme (which is already working and has been checked in).

Hi, Andy

Thanks for your quick reply!

I knew the buddpress features like profile and messages will be shown in the
theme, I wonder what is the blog backend admin supposed to be, such as
Manage, Write, Settings and etc. thanks!

I noticed that image.php is not in the current theme folder yet, could you
add it in so that Gallery shortcut could have a better presentation in the

I just got the latest SVN of BP and when I applied it the buddypress  
theme says i'm missing bp-messages-admin.php:

Warning: main(bp-messages/bp-messages-admin.php) [function.main]:  
failed to open stream: No such file or directory in

I commented out the line for now, but does this even exist? I can't  
seem to determine that.

Thanks Andy and David,

that answered my question -- I already added an empty php-file but that 
didn't feel right... ;-)

I found an older copy of bp-core.php, and comparing it to the latest  
bp-core, there appears to be a chunk of functions missing including  
bp_int(). Now, these functions could have been easily moved elsewhere  
but a quick search reveals nothing. So it appears maybe they are  
missing? The chunk is below. I took this chunk from 0.1.3 core and put  
it in the latest bp-core.php and so far i'm not getting fatal errors.  
I'm sure Andy can clear this up?

I've implemented some catch URI code based on Chris Taylor's work in  
the latest version in trunk. Basically, it works like this:

http://mydomain.com/username/[component_name]/[action_name]/ 
[action_vars]

So: http://buddypress.local/apeatling/profile/edit/group/1

The following globals will be set:

$current_component = 'profile'
$current_action = 'edit'
$action_variables = array ( 'group', 1 )

You can access these variables wherever you like and use them within  
your own custom template functions.

I'm using them to direct to custom templates using the new 'bp_uri()'  
function:

if ( $current_action == 'change-avatar' && $loggedin_userid ==  
$current_userid )
	bp_catch_uri( 'profile/change-avatar' );

Where 'profile/change-avatar' represents a folder and filename within  
the template directory.

This hopefully will allow BuddyPress to use a whole range of custom  
URL's whilst still using the default .htaccess file for an MU install.

Andy,

This sounds great!

Are there plans to increase the functionality of the new functions so you
can catch URIs that don't have a username after the domain name (or is it
already implemented that way)? 

For example if I wanted to theme a group's moderation tasks I may want to
intercept a URI like:
http://buddypress.local/group_name/comment/edit/comment_id
And pass it to code in the current template directory.

Martin

Already implemented, it should work fine with both vhost installs and  
non-vhost installs.

I've taken these out of the core for now, as I don't want to be  
tagging core versions with code in it that applies to a yet untagged  
component.

For now, I will add these functions back into the groups code.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] name of bp-groups-functions.php in classes file
Message-ID: <486362D9.6090706@jeroensmeets.net>

Hi Andy,

a small remark from someone who is happy with every new version in trunk:

in bp-groups/bp-groups-class.php on line 9 you have

    include_once ( 'bp_groups_functions.php' );

That probably should be

    include_once ( 'bp-groups-functions.php' );

Maybe more important, the resulting warning is displayed twice, which 
means the bp-groups-class.php is included twice on page display?

Greetings,

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Profile pic 2 admins...
Message-ID: <E0150BE7-754C-46B0-A19C-C7CE836905C2@hanfelt.se>

If you have 2 admins you will get no profile pic..
I found some code and merged it with buddypress to get atleast one  
admin profile pic to show up..

this code can be pasted in optionsbar.php in the theme

			<?php // bp_get_options_avatar() ?>
			<?php
			global $wpdb, $blog_id, $wpmuBaseTablePrefix;
         	
			$blogownerid = $wpdb->get_var("SELECT post_author FROM " .  
$wpmuBaseTablePrefix . $blog_id . "_posts");
			$bp_profile_pix = xprofile_get_avatar($blogownerid, $version = 1);
		 echo $bp_profile_pix;

It replaces the function above bp_get_options_avatar()

Im no developer but i can understand some code i see. Maybe this is  
useful for the developers of buddypress...

Cheers!
