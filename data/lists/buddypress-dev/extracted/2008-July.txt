Subject: [buddypress-dev] Avatar uploads
Message-ID: <142874.89017.qm@web32507.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

First, very nice hopefully I will be able to contribute somehow.
I have this installed with latest wpmu 1.5.1, prior to the current tags_extended-profiles_0.3.2-r161 version of xprofiles I was able to upload an avatar in the admin area and it would show on profile, now I can include the avatar on sign up , but when I activate the image does not show and I get both crop dialogs (50x50, 220x220) on the activate.php page, then on complete no image displays, also if I add an image in admin  avatar it is named differently than new avatar name.

Also after upgrade I had to add the db fields manually to wp_blogs for the field list and avatar values.

ok, so long story short. What I want is a version that works just like http://testdrivewpmu.com for the avatar upload. any idea how to accomplish this?

Thanks
Chris

The mu version there is definitely 1.5.1.

All I can think of is to delete the buddypress plugin file and 
re-upload  them, instead of overwriting the older ones you had.

By the way, it just occurred to me that I am using sub directories not subdomains. Any one else using subdirectories?

I think I will check over the cssjs again, and maybe redo the install.
Is there a describe available on the full db structure?

Thanks

I've got an installation working on sub directories, I will take a  
look at this. Also - make sure you are including the username on  
activation otherwise images will break ... http://install.com/USERNAME/wp-activate.php?key= 
...

There isn't but if you look at the first function in the main file of  
every component (bp-xprofile.php, bp-messages.php ... ) you will see  
the DB table creation syntax. That should do the job?

In fact, I take that back, it works fine without. I've just signed up  
on a subdir install with MU1.5.1 and avatar images seem to upload,  
crop and show up fine. Try reinstalling?

If you send a message to someone under your buddypress homepage and  
click view sent message everything is fine.
But if you do the same under blog admin and then view your sent  
message at least i get 500 internal server error...

I still need to iron out a way of mirroring the template functionality  
with the admin area functionality. There will be bugs in the admin  
area right now, but the template stuff will work fine.

I'll be fixing this fairly shortly.

I think i needed to restate my directory structure here.

I have the wpmu running in a subdirectory and creating subdirectories and there is a broken path somewhere so that the process of activate is looking for the wp-content directory in the root of my webservers http location.

To illustrate

my setup
http://www.name.com/wpmublogs/

for testing a new setup would go here
http://www.name.com/wpmublogs/testing

Now once I have uploaded all current tags during activate I get an error that /wp-content can't be found and then I see both avatar edit buttons / dialog on one page.

I realize I could move it all to root and it would be ok , maybe but I am testing in this directory. Any ideas where this might be?

Chris

That makes sense then, it will mess up the friendly URL catching code  
for BuddyPress.

You can modify a file to make this work though - bp-core/bp-core- 
catchuri.php

Change:
$component_index = 0;
$action_index = 1;

To:
$component_index = 1;
$action_index = 2;

That should *hopefully* do it. But you may still have issues with links.

It seems that the function xprofile_add_jquery() is not loading the values on the rendering of the page if wpmu is installed in a subdirectory, not root of server. I do not see any of these references in my activate page source.

Can someone tell me how the value for get_option('home') is loaded for in bp-xprofile-signup.php? line 404 etc..

No, this did not fix it.

The whole set of xprofile_add_jquery() function are not loaded in the page.
I see everything else, values for the avatars, etc...

Thanks

So far everythings look really great.

 

Now my question: if im logged in as a user and press a link eg. Messages 
I get a sub navbar MY MESSAGES  (http://mybuddypress.com/messages/)

>From this moment every link I press everything is double upp, If I press
compose I get double up (http://mybuddypress.com/messages/messages/compose)

Is it my system or did I find some bug 
?

Sorry for my SWEnglish

 

Kind regards

Message-ID: <a387d97c0807051355w220cbedbj790df3b081f82b86@mail.gmail.com>

Are you looking for a plugin to host the albums? such as phpgallery?
or do you want to allow members to link to their existing albums on
other sites, such as flickr?

I'm currently using "Flickr Photo Gallery" on my personal blog, but I
have no idea how well, if it all it would support MU. Plugin available
from http://www.tantannoodles.com/toolkit/photo-album/

That one doesn't work well in MU and only shows Flickr photos, not ones 
uploaded to the site. :-/

NextGen works though. haven;t tried it with BuddyPress, but it *should* 
be okay.

I'm working on the friends component right now, which will essentially  
do this.

If you want to list members, you can just query the users table, and  
then get their avatar and link based on their id.

<?php
$users = $wpdb->get_results ( $wpdb->prepare( "SELECT id FROM  
wp_users" ) );
for ( $i = 0; $i < count($users); $i++ ) {
   $bp_users[] = array(
     'avatar' => xprofile_get_avatar( $users[$i]->id, 1 ),
     'link' => bp_core_get_userlink( $users[$i]->id )
   );
}
?>

Then you can loop through and do whatever you want with $bp_users:

<?php
  for ( $i = 0; $i < count($bp_users); $i++ ) {
    echo '<p>' . $bp_users[$i]['avatar'] . '</p>';
    echo '<p>' . $bp_users[$i]['link'] . '</p>';
  }
?>

I haven't tested or even tried that code, but it should work if I  
haven't made any typos.

You'll also need to add:

<?php global $wpdb; ?>

before that code if you put this in page template.

Message-ID: <839941.15783.qm@web32503.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I have some issues when I was trying to upload avatars to an install that was at mydomain/testhere instead of at root of webserver, had problems with js not loading on the page and would get both croppers on one page and no image at all.

I installed in root of http and most of those problems went away and now  actually I see one cropper on activate per step, yet no image is shown, I see a grey box where image should be. 
The image does not get stored correctly and I cant see what to crop.
No image is shown on signup profile page.

Any ideas?
No errors in log.

Thanks,
Chris

This is image permission errors... make sure you are activating the  
account with the username in the activation link... this is especially  
important if you are using subdomains. Also make sure you have the  
correct permissions set on the blogs.dir directory.

My activate path that I use is constructed like 

http://domain.com/wp-activate.php?key=e14637e9357926d1

I see the code checks the nonce, returns values from wp_signup and updates  wp-blogs.

I am not doing subdomains, I will check the blogs.dir permissions.

I'm not sure I can send attachments to the mailing list, so I'll include the
code for the widget I've been working on below. This is my first ever
widget, so if I've done something dumb be gentle :)

This widget shows the latest X (configurable through the widget admin page,
defaults to 5) users, save it to snnewusers.php and upload to the mu-plugins
folder, drop the widget on a widget enabled theme.

Hope this helps,

Martin

Thank so much everyone! I decided to go with Andy?s. Now I need to figure
out how to define the number of users listed, hyperlink the avatar and
display the user names below the avatar..

Thanks again!

G'day everyone

Just a quick delurk from my side -- I'm investigating the possibilities

lurking here also to see if it would be fairly simple to organise.

Well, back to the lurk.

Martin,
Very nice, I was using a hacked version of list_all.

I am still having issues with this.

The images are in the blogs.dir, permissions are good - ok

I can see the reference in the source of html on activate.php - ok

Image is represented by grey box the size of my uploaded image with the crop box in the middle. - not ok

I am configured as subdirectory, no problems with any other part of process.
Any ideas? I am current with code.

image attached has example

I just tried adding a new avatar to the site I'm developing on and appear to
have a slightly different problem.

Can you do a view source of the avatar crop page and find the line that
starts with <div class="wrap"><h2>Your Avatar</h2>?

What src do the image tags have on that line?

Hope this makes sense,

Martin

Filesystem paths should not be coming out here, I'll fix this, but  
that isn't the problem.

The image paths do not include the http://domain.com/username/ part...  
so the permissions on the image are failing. Try copying the path,  
adding the http://domain.com/ onto the start, then pasting it into  
your browser URL bar. The picture should show up.

This is where the domain should be set:
http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk/bp-xprofile/bp-xprofile-avatars.php#L368

Although this seems to work for me, I'm thinking the get_usermeta is  
not working for you. This will need to be looked into. Can you log a  
ticket in trac?

A quick fix for now would be to just hard code your URL into there.  
I'll fix this ASAP, or if anyone else wants to investigate, please go  
ahead. :)

Thanks
Andy

Well I feel kinda bad,

I noticed that you sent me trunk file example, I have upgraded the x-profile to trunk, now the avatar uploads.


So, I will now need to redo some stuff, but probably forget about the ticket because it was tag version???

There is no template used by WordPress MU for the signup page. You  
will need to style this page with CSS, or modify the "home" theme.

Andy, I have tried the code below, and it works fine just out of the
box in a template. Thanks!

But instead of the User names, I would like for the First and Last
Name to display, as from the BP Profiles.  (To have a more Facebook
kind of experience where the actual name is important - rather than a
user name.)

How do I modify the code below to get a list of First and Last names?

regards Wessel

I'm working on the friends component right now, which will essentially
do this.

If you want to list members, you can just query the users table, and
then get their avatar and link based on their id.

<?php
$users = $wpdb->get_results ( $wpdb->prepare( "SELECT id FROM
wp_users" ) );
for ( $i = 0; $i < count($users); $i++ ) {
  $bp_users[] = array(
    'avatar' => xprofile_get_avatar( $users[$i]->id, 1 ),
    'link' => bp_core_get_userlink( $users[$i]->id )
  );
}
?>

Then you can loop through and do whatever you want with $bp_users:

<?php
 for ( $i = 0; $i < count($bp_users); $i++ ) {
   echo '<p>' . $bp_users[$i]['avatar'] . '</p>';
   echo '<p>' . $bp_users[$i]['link'] . '</p>';
 }
?>

I haven't tested or even tried that code, but it should work if I
haven't made any typos.

Andy

As some of the core components for Buddypress are stabilizing I can see a
need for any plug-in or theme developers on this list to exchange
information about the relevant functions that Buddypress exposes for us to
use, recent examples are things like xprofile_get_avatar and
bp_core_get_userlink etc. 

 

Instead of burdening Andy with this task (poor guy is busy enough coding as
it is J ), I'd like to propose that the developers on this list that are
developing Buddypress compatible widgets, plug-ins or themes (like myself)
collaborate on a Wiki which could be later used to form a Buddypress Codex.
Would anyone else be interested on helping out on this?

 

If there is enough interest, what would your preferred host be? If Andy is
agreeable one possibility is part of the existing Buddypress Wiki, or we
could create a new site and upload Media Wiki (or equivalent) to it.

 

So what do you say, are you interested in helping document Buddypress, it
could be our way of paying Andy back for all the hard coding work he's been
doing!?!

I can help out with any questions and contribute where possible. There  
is actually a codex already set up and ready to go.

It's a bleeding edge WordPress install at: http://codex.buddypress.org/

This should include the latest change tracking available in 2.6. You  
can sign up as a contributer here: http://codex.buddypress.org/wp/wp-register.php

Once you're signed up you can log in here: http://codex.buddypress.org/wp/wp-admin/

I think the structure could somewhat mirror a simple version of the  
WordPress codex, what does everyone think?

I have been trying to work through my issues all night and I think  
sleep depravation is setting in. Anywho let me start is I had this  
problem with the stable download and the trunk download which I see  
Andy updated about an hour or so ago.

When I click Messages under the site admin I am presented with this  
error:

Warning: call_user_func_array() [function.call-user-func-array]:  
First argument is expected to be a valid callback,  
'messages_settings' was given in /home/******/public_html/wp-includes/ 
plugin.php on line 311

Same error when clicking the Friends Tab:

First argument is expected to be a valid callback, 'friends_list' was  
given in /home/******/public_html/wp-includes/plugin.php on line 311

Also when I try to upload an image for profile use to give me an error:

  Upload Failed! Your image is likely too big.

When I can upload the same image to testdrivewpmu.com and crop it  
with no problems

Suggestions?

Message-ID: <20080715081842.5ztc9n3y8wows0ck@www.dimensionmedia.com>

Just downloaded the lastest build of BuddyPress Template and i'm  
getting 404 errors in the navigational links. I have installed WP MU  
in a subdirectory on my site:

http://davidandpeta-gaye.com/davidsocial/

When i log in, the left most links all return 404 errors. The log out  
link isn't even pointing to the correct location (pointing to outside  
of the install).

It's even worse for a user.

http://davidandpeta-gaye.com/davidsocial/davidbisset/

The homepage isn't the profile page, but a blog. Links still produce  
404 errors.

I noticed this in the trac, but didn't produce anything fruitful:
http://trac.buddypress.org/ticket/33

I have been playing around with these values in bp-core-catchuri.php:
$component_index = 0;
$action_index = 1;

This seems to help (the homepage of a user now is a profile, but the  
links are still producing 404 errors and the submenus are still off).

Can anyone lend a little help here? Thanks. :-)

Andy,

Cool, I went ahead and registered there.

For me the most useful thing would be a Buddypress Function Reference, a
first pass could have an index page similar to
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference, and initially the pages for
each function could have a description, usage and parameters section, later
on (as time permits) examples could be added.

I also think creating an FAQ somewhere (on the codex?) based on questions
that are asked on the mailing list would be a way of pointing people who are
just discovering Buddypress in the right direction.

As a separate, but related question is Buddypress going to have its own
Extend section for plug-ins and possibly themes that require Buddypress to
function, or should we just be adding things to the Wordpress Plug-ins
Directory and indicate in the readme what functionality won't work if
Buddypress isn't installed?

Does this sound like a good start to you?  

Martin

I'm a content producer who needs BuddyPress and not so much a developer
(though I'm learning, I started about two weeks ago). I think the Wiki is an
extremely useful and great idea.

I can't participate by contributing but I can start testing various things
you all have included and that'll make a better product in the end. It's
also hard to keep up with the e-mails, especially since I won't begin the
bulk of my work for another month so I'm losing track of all the
troubleshooting before I get there.

Sounds like a great idea. Do it! Thanks everyone for this project.

-Mike

For some reason my wordpress.org login isn't letting me in to add this as a
ticket..

 

Anyway I duplicated this on my testdrivewpmu blog
(http://thebigbrit.testdrivewpmu.com/).

1.       Create a blog entry in your blog where the first word in the title
is 'Edit', resulting in a permalink like
http://thebigbrit.testdrivewpmu.com/2008/07/edit-me/

2.       Go to your blog, and select profile, then edit profile, the blog
post will show instead of the edit profile page.

Something along the lines of:

<?php

$sql = $wpdb->prepare( "SELECT id FROM $wpdb->users ORDER BY user_registered
DESC LIMIT 0, %d", 5 );

$users = $wpdb->get_results( $sql );

 

// These lines generate our output. 

?>

<div class="widget"><h2 class="slat-title">New Users</h2>

<ul class="userlist">

<?php

foreach($users as $user) 

{

  $user_info = get_userdata($user->id);

  $blog = get_active_blog_for_user($user->id)

?>   

  <li class="users">

    <div class="thumb_user">

      <a href="<?php echo $blog->siteurl; ?>" title="<?php echo
$user_info->display_name ?>"><?php get_avatar($user->id); ?></a>

    </div>

    <div class="text">

      <a href="<?php echo $blog->siteurl; ?>"><?php echo
$user_info->display_name ?></a>

    </div>

    <div class="clear" />

  </li>    

<?php

}

?>

</ul>

 

 

Should work if you add it to your template.

Martin, thanks for this, but this once again gives usernames and not
first name, last name as per the bp_profile, not so?

Subject: [buddypress-dev] installation and profile problems on xampp
Message-ID: <000b01c8e704$297184d0$fb47fea9@schwarzpc3>

Hi, 

I've installed WPMU/Buddypress (current SVN version) on a local windows
XAMPP-run server, and WPMU seems to work fine - although that's difficult to
determine for me as I've never worked with WPMU before (just on WP).
Initially, the buddypress plugins seemed to produce more errors than I could
count, but it seems a lot of that is due to configuration issues.

It's still very buggy, but at least I've managed to get a profile up and
running now.

That said - I still have the avatar uploading issues some people have
complained about - the image is uploaded and the cropper works, but the
variables constructed and put in the DB aren't correct - this is the URL in
the db

D:\Programme\xampp\htdocs\kuk/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files//2008/07/kopie-vo
n-504553_52097412-avatar1.jpg

As you can see there's two slashes between files and 2008, and the ABSPATH
is using backslashes. I've looked at the code quickly, and it seems to use
the WP image uploader to upload the files. Using that I can easily upload
pictures and see them - the URL for the same file in the WP uploader is
(johnny is the name of the blog)

http://localhost.localdomain/kuk/johnny/files/2008/07/kopie-von-504553_52097
412.jpg

Installing WPMU/Buddypress in a subdirectory apparently only works after
changing the $component_index and $action_index variables. Before doing
that, the profile or blog links in the theme would not show. But there's
still a lot of things with URLs that don't seem to work -

Under "ME", the left sidebar in the profile lists "Profile", "Blog",
"Messages", "Friends" (always activated), and "Log Out" - all of the links
to these pages are currently giving my a 404. They are omitting the
installation name in the URL (kuk in this case). Thus the profile link in
the left bar - http://localhost.localdomain/johnny/profile/ - gives a 404,
while the "profile", "blog", and "friends" link in the middle bar (which
uses the installation name) -
http://localhost.localdomain/kuk/johnny/profile - shows the corresponding
page. I'm not sure about the account structure and the URL catcher in
buddypress - so I don't know if that's just a theme problem or if there is
something wrong with the installation, as the "login" and "logout" and
"messages" links in the left bar will not with even when I manually add the
installation name "kuk" to the URL.

Another thing that won't be displayed correctly are groups. I can create
groups, but I can't look at them - the "click here to see it" link -
"http://localhost.localdomain/kuk/groups/new-group/" takes me to the signup
page "http://localhost.localdomain/kuk/wp-signup.php?new=groups". It's not
mod_rewrite, as WPMU created Permalinks are handled correctly.

Maybe someone has an idea about this.

Tobias

It shows the display name, which is normally shown as the author against
posts in their blogs. This can be set by going to wp-admin and clicking on
Users | Your Profile. If they have set their first and last name it will
have their full name as an option in the "Display name publicly as". I
personally would let each user decide which information they want to make
public, so my code was based on that.

Incidentally I just noticed that if I enter a First and Last name on the
account creation page it appears to be carried into the Buddypress Profile
section put not onto the WMPMU (Users | Your Profile) page, I'm not sure if
this is intentional or not.

I'm going to be doing some heavy debugging today and fix these issues  
people are having with links.

Firstly however, let me clear a few things up with installations:

  - I am developing BuddyPress on the latest stable release of WPMU  
(1.5.1) so please don't expect it to work on the latest build in SVN.  
I keep a copy to test with, but I can't spend time tweaking every-time  
some code is changed right now.

  - Secondly - *don't* mix and match tagged components with the trunk!  
Either only run tagged components OR run all components from the  
trunk. For instance - if you run the tagged 0.2 version of the core  
and then try and install the latest friends component, things will  
break.

So just to make sure everyone gets that - if you want to run the  
bleeding edge stuff - install everything in trunk, and nothing in the  
tags directory. However, if you're happy to run more stable component  
versions and are okay to wait until new components are tagged... don't  
install anything from the trunk.

  - I can't guarantee anything is going to run on a windows server. I  
have no windows servers to test with. If you want to run BuddyPress  
then you'll need a linux/apache server for now.

- Lastly, groups will be re-structured to fit the style of the other  
components. It will also not show anything in the default theme yet.  
I'm getting to it ASAP.


Cheers
Andy

This is not implemented, I have commented it out now.

There is no admin area support yet, it is all through the theme right  
now, again I have commented out the admin tab.

Make sure you have the GD image library installed on your server.

This would be fantastic, add a page to the codex for this if you like.

I have plans for blogs with multiple admins. They will be handled  
differently. Right now however, this isn't supported. I'm  
concentrating on fresh installs first.

If you get the latest version from SVN trunk you will see the first

Subject: [buddypress-dev] README - if you have a BuddyPress installation
Message-ID: <5B504A7A-29D0-4686-A67F-0056ACA20D21@automattic.com>

--- Adding this to a new thread ---

I'm going to be doing some heavy debugging today and fix these issues  
people are having with links.

Firstly however, let me clear a few things up with installations:

- I am developing BuddyPress on the latest stable release of WPMU  
(1.5.1) so please don't expect it to work on the latest build in SVN.  
I keep a copy to test with, but I can't spend time tweaking every-time  
some code is changed right now.

- Secondly - *don't* mix and match tagged components with the trunk!  
Either only run tagged components OR run all components from the  
trunk. For instance - if you run the tagged 0.2 version of the core  
and then try and install the latest friends component, things will  
break.

So just to make sure everyone gets that - if you want to run the  
bleeding edge stuff - install everything in trunk, and nothing in the  
tags directory. However, if you're happy to run more stable component  
versions and are okay to wait until new components are tagged... don't  
install anything from the trunk.

- I can't guarantee anything is going to run on a windows server. I  
have no windows servers to test with. If you want to run BuddyPress  
then you'll need a linux/apache server for now.

- Lastly, groups will be re-structured to fit the style of the other  
components. It will also not show anything in the default theme yet.  
I'm getting to it ASAP.


Cheers

Andy,

I'd love to, but I seem to be only able to write posts, not pages, my
username is the thebigbrit if you need to make a permission change. Or
should I write it as a post, and you move it around as necessary?

Martin

Thank you I went through the list thread by thread and found that  
answer, the mailing list needs a search feature or maybe needs to  
move over to bbpress. Also I got the upload to work by downgrading to  
1.5.1 instead of the 2.6.

I've also started a glossary for the BuddyPress Codex. I find it helpful to
differentiate between a lot of the terms, particularly for newer users and
admins to BuddyPress.

a new widget configuration for my sidebar I'm getting the following error :

*Warning*: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
(output started at
/var/www/htdocs/wpmu2.5/wp-content/mu-plugins/bp-messages/bp-messages-cssjs.php:58)
in */var/www/htdocs/wpmu2.5/wp-includes/pluggable.php* on line *701*

the strange stuff is related to the fact that i don't think to need the
messagges css on the widgets page.

(I'm not using standard theme on frontside, but this is not the frontside,
so I thinks this is not related, am I wrong?)

Any solutions?

commenting line: 140 of bp-messages-cssjs.php let me avoid problem and also
do not provide me real modification on admin page. I know that's not the
right solution but a temporary one, let me know the correct once

Thanks and Regards

Hi,
I'm trying to create a new front-end menu that appears for users when they
are logged in. I've attempted to outline my problem very thoroughly below:

*Quick History
*My goal is to create a new level of navigation in the default Buddy Press
Theme*
*I found how to create the navigation easily enough using the bp_nav[] and
the bp_users_nav[] arrays.
I am now working on catching the actions via pretty URLs. I can't seem to
get the $current_action to register though.

*My Scenario*
My new menu should show *menu-parent* in the left-most sidebar with *
menu-child1*, *menuchild2*, *menuchild3*, and *menuchild4* in the middle
bar. The content associated with *menu-child1* should display as the default
page in the main content area.

*What is currently working
*The above scenario is working fine without any problems. I have
successfully created the menus and the default content by mimicking the same
programing logic (arrays and functions) used by the xprofile menu and pages.

*What is not working*
Selecting *menuchild2*, *menuchild3*, or *menuchild4* from the middle
options bar does not take me to the appropriate page, but instead, takes me
to WPMU's create a new blog page.
*
Why I think it's not working
*It appears to me that the default content is working correctly because the
$current_action variable is not set in the _catch_actions function (like the
xprofile_catch_action_function).
While trying to track this down, put a PHP die($bp_uri) function on line 19
in bp-core-catchuri.php directly under the $bp_uri variable.
When I select any default menu like Profile -> Edit Avatar I get the
expected uri : /profile/change-avatar
But if I select one of my new menu times like Menu-Parent -> Menu Child 1, I
get  /wp-signup.php?new=menu-child1 as the $bp_uri

*Question*
How does BP avoid this "new blog registration" redirect. Is it a DB
configuration. It seems to me that bp-core-catchuri.php is one of the first
scripts to fire off. I can't find for the life of me what I'm missing.

Thanks for bearing with me. I hope that someone might have an answer for me!

I had this problem as well when moving to my own server. I found out  
after searching alot that turning on "output_buffering" in php will do  
the trick...

Cheers!

Hi Glenn,

 

A quick question.

 

Are you using non virtual hosts and are trying to use URLs of the form
domain.com/current_component/current_action? If so it should be of the form
domain.com/blog/current_component/current_action for the main blog or
domain.com/*blog-name*/current_component/current_action for a users blog.

 

If that doesn't help can you post the contents of your _catch_action
function?

 

Martin

Hi,
I'm trying to create a new front-end menu that appears for users when they

menu-child1, menuchild2, menuchild3, and menuchild4 in the middle bar. The

the main content area.

Thanks for the reply. That was my mistake in the explanation. I am using the
subdirectories and it is in the form you mentioned with the /blogname/ in
the url.

Here's the functions: http://glennansley.com/bp_functions.txt

I should probably mention that I've added this to the top of the
bp-groups.php file
I have also included the following at the top of the file:
$bp_groups_slug = 'groups';

Thanks again!

Thank you guys so much for your help (A couple of you have emailed me
individually). Here's some further findings I thought I would throw back to
the community. Note: this is just a dev domain name and probably won't even
be used with buddypress... it was what I had free right now for testing
though.

I think I'm missing something somewhere else. Compare these results
I have placed a die($current_action) in bp-core-catchuri.php directly under
line 28 where $current action is defined.

*index pages*
http://saidatsebts.com/setup/profile creates the *expected* result:
/setup/profile
http://saidatsebts.com/setup/groups creates the *expected* result:
/setup/groups
*
subpages that exist*
http://saidatsebts.com/setup/profile/edit creates the *expected* result:
/setup/profile/edit
http://saidatsebts.com/setup/groups creates an *unexpected* result:
/wp-signup.php?new=group-invites

*fake subpages not setup in nav or existing in file structure*
http://saidatsebts.com/setup/profile/bottabingbottaboom creates an
interesting result (doubling the action):
/setup/profile/bottabingbottaboombottabingbottaboom
http://saidatsebts.com/setup/groups/bottabingbottaboom still creates that
weird unexpected registration uri: /wp-signup.php?new=bottabingbottaboom

It seems that my url is getting "hijacked before the bp-core-catchuri.php
file is even invoked (which is almost immediately)
Also, why is die($current_action) printing the entire uri?

Still searching...

By the way, Avatar issue is corrected.

Testing testdrivewpmu.com friends module
 
	1. Link to your profile in my message box points to my profile.
http://chugga.testdrivewpmu.com/messages/
 
	1. Clicked ?add friend? on your profile, got a working ? message? 
That is all, no request completed.
 
The ?You have no friends? is kind of harsh. :)
 
One other thing, I think the 450 px size for avatar image is
too big. I suggest the image at like 250, not 450.

This is a TinyMCE integration bug. I will be fixing this ASAP.

These have been fixed.

I'll be fixing this soon. I'd like to upscale images instead of  
requiring a certain size.

So, looks like some systems are going to spit the  
allow_call_time_pass_reference error out.

A domain I have at Dreamhost is still throwing the error, but my  
Fedora 9 test machine at work is happy as a clam. Both are  
"supposedly" running php 5.2.6. Oh the Monday trauma! Of course the  
Fedora box even has allow_call_time_pass_reference set as Off. I don't  
get it, and it's bugging me.

Anyone care to explain this? Dreamhost lousy config? Stock Fedora 9  
weirdness? Both?

The fix is easy for some php5 systems... remove the "&" in bp-friends- 
classes.php or change the php.ini. I'm just curious if either of these  
solutions will be documented or if php5 does allow "&" references for  
properly configured and updated systems. I couldn't find it documented.

Andy,
What is supposed to happen with the friends module?
I still see the error, yet now it is not fatal.
I added a friend request, where should the requester see the request to be afriend?

Andy,
Never mind on the explanation on what happens when a friend is requested. I see what is going on.
Time seems not correct on request.

The link is incorrect on my friends list.
The name is good, the href is incorrect.

Mine should be 
http://mysite.com/chris

is 
http://mysite.comchris


The friend finder is searching ?

Can a Buddypress profile page for a WP community music-related web site be setup as to allow a member to "market" themselves and facilitate the uploading/viewing of images, audio and video files?

Hello,
I'm sperimenting a little problem on my wpmu installation with buddypress
installed.
I've the option on registration set to offer only account registration, blog
activation depends on admin action, but after new registration people get
their blog active without any admin action. Is a buddypress feature or just
something not right working?
thx

Nice post URLs are working (e.g.

Hi Andy,

Hi Jeff,

I think you'll need a couple of extra plugins to handle the upload and
playing of music files, but BuddyPress can handle the core of a
community site very well. I'd be interested in hearing some more about
this project as I'm a musican (well, I used to be, but now I'm much
better!).

Newsblog-wise, I'd love a plugin that adds digg-functionality to stories, so
that an MU network's best blogs float to the front page everyday.

Thanks for the reply Chris.

I have started the building process with Joomla and the Community Builder plug in.  But then I received an email with a reference to Buddypress in it.

Specifically, do you - or any other list member - know which additional plug ins may be necessary to achieve this type of web site?

Thanks!

is there a quick fix to show the "tick.gif" image. for the required

it is currently a nice annoying blue question mark.

Yes you need to modify 2 lines in bp-xprofile-admin.php
line 12 replace global $image_base; with global $bp_xprofile_image_base;
line 98 replace <img src="' . $image_base . '/tick.gif" alt="Yes" />  
with <img src="' . $bp_xprofile_image_base . '/tick.gif" alt="Yes" />

it worked for me

I'd be interested to hear people's feedback on the idea of removing  
native avatar support and just using Gravatar?

Comments welcome.

I would think that a plugin for wpmu to have the gravatar as an option would be cool. I would not think that default only gravatar would be a good idea.

Gravatar-only requires a dependency on another brand.  Someone trying use
Buddypress to build a business would have to essentially partner with
Gravatar out of the box.  So I'd vote no on Gravatar-only.

This is I believe is true, so it removes the need to download and  
require something external.

Having read people's feedback, the consensus seems to be gravatars (or  
any other avatar service) would be best as an option if you didn't  
want to upload yet another avatar image.

if you're going to market buddy press for business or people to use to  
build their own networking application, it would make sense to have  
it's own built in avatar system and to allow other's as an option. I  
think a Gravatar only solution would be limiting.

I just got that error and it's because "The GD image library is not  
installed". To find out for sure, update this function:

function xprofile_thumb_error( $str ) {
	return preg_match( '/(filetype|invalid|not found)/is', $str );
}


with this:

function xprofile_thumb_error( $str ) {
	print(ReflectionObject::export($str));
	print($str->get_error_message());
	return preg_match( '/(filetype|invalid|not found)/is', $str );
}

~ line 425: wp-content/mu-plugins/in bp-xprofile-avatars.php

Hope this helps.

BuddyPress is running on both my local copy and on testdrivewpmu.com  
with the new WPMU 2.6. This is with the version in trunk, not the  
tagged components.

You should be okay to upgrade if you are running trunk, but please  
record any issues in trac if you come across them.

I have the same error with the latsest r249 release. I tried it under both
1.51 and 2.6 MU. The default theme is installed as default in the themes
folder (standard). The error appears on all pages, except blog.

Interesting. I've not had time to return to the problem since posting 
here. Have you installed from scratch (I did)? Anything out of the 
ordinary in the install process (I can't think of anything odd in mine, 
and WPMu seemed to be working fine before BuddyPress installed).

Please do let me know if you get any further with this issue.

This is disabled in the latest trunk. I will re-enable it once more  
has been developed.

If you want to comment out this functionality, then comment out the  
following functions:

start_dash()
replace_dash()
end_dash()
render_dash()

I'll be adding this in the next version. Also - if anyone is  
interested in helping create a generic email notification function  
that all components can use, let me know. Something revolving around  
wp_mail()

Anyway to show on the homepage of the BP template the latest/newest  
members of the wordpress MU site? I don't think this is directly  
BuddyPress related, but in case there is a function buried  
somewhere... what also would be great would be a "latest active"  
member list! :-)

I updated to wpmu 2.6 with latest trunk. I noticed that messages/friends sections disappeared in backend of wpmu. I would like to keep it in there and choose different theme for my own website. I still think that we should have a widget option to show buddypress features anywhere on different themes.

I tried to use it with wpmu 2.6. Its not working to display anything. Why don't we have WPMU site to display only plugins for WPMU instead all plugins mixed up in wordpress.org plugins directory.

Yes I followed the instructions. It displayed the code as I inserted in the template. I happened to have a page called sitemap.php then inserted it. It shows the code to call up but no action. The last time it has been updated pretty long time ago. I wasnt sure if its compatible with latest wpmu version.

That plug is at a site for just WPMU plugins. 

Did you add the plugin call to the template? If you take this plugin and just plop it in the mu-plugins directory, no ti doesn't "do" anything. You have to tell ti what you want and where you want it. 

Please read the info in the plugin file. :)

I found the problem that I had to add <? with the code to run it :) It was not instructed in first place ;)

Yes, it works with the latest version. I use this same plugin all the time, in fact. 

If it's just displaying it as plain text, then you missed something. Got a link where I can go look?
