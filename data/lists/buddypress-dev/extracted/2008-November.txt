Subject: [buddypress-dev] Image Upload Size?
Message-ID: <c523cf40811011348r20df4cd4y23edbaabaf9ca3ac@mail.gmail.com>

I have some users that are complaining when they upload their images
for an avatar that it reports that the image is to big. What are the
file limitations, and can they be adapted? If anything, I would just
like to add that text into the registration screen.

Thanks,

Jake Spurlock

You can change max file upload size in wp-admin under site admin >  
options I think.

You may have to change it in your PHP ini too.

One of my little BP hacks was to give a more verbose description to 
users around the Avatar upload field where it clearly states the minimum 
required dimension for upload and the max file size it will accept. I 
think this is one of those things that would be good if it was easily 
customisable as different audiences require different levels of explanation.

For example, Andy, you could define all the messages in a separate 
include file as constants so then people could change all those things 
in one place for any particular plugin. Ideally it would be cool to 
create some kind of override system whereby buddypress developers could 
create their constants override file and if it's present the values 
there would override the defaults.

Regards,
Robert

I have been facing a similar problem with my users. The problem is  
seemingly limited to Internet Explorer.

Any ideas?

Hi,

Not sure if advertising for work is allowed here, but here goes :)

I have a site in the UK that I am installing buddypress on, but I  
need someone to do maintenance and ensure updates are adhered to and  
most probably some customisations made. If anyone is looking, let me  
know.

You can take a look at my hacked version http:// 
community.investor.co.uk/ as a start... I know buddypress is pre- 
release but it ticks so many boxes I am going to go live with it soon.

I really love the buddypress thing and its very timely for me. Andy,  
I am also happy to donate, money or graphics, if thats needed? :)

Kind regards

Make sure you are updating the theme files as well as the plugin  
files. If you're making design changes, keep all your CSS updates in a  
file called "custom-styles.css" and place that in the buddypress- 
member/ theme directory. It will be read in automatically.

Hi Paul,

 

I will be quite happy to do that.

By 'hacked version', what do you mean? Do you mean hacked BuddyPress or
hacked WPMU?

Dean

If you'd be willing to donate back some of your customizations to the

Hi,
Just a quick question... do you know when BuddyPress will be fully released
or is that secret ;)

Upgrade to the latest trunk - I've disabled the cause of this problem  
until we can work out the issues.

Message-ID: <491202F4.30406@gmail.com>

Hey Andy,

I just posted on the Buddypress Testers group and ticked the box to 
notify all members and it took ages... I know it says it slows down 
posting but I think the way to go with this is to do the notifications 
in the background as you'd probably hit the max execution time for 
scripts at some point for really large groups...

Regards,
Robert

We've been chatting in #buddypress about this - I think the way to go  
would be to cron the email sending for X number of seconds after the  
wire message is posted. That way the user can continue to browse the  
site while the notifications are being sent.

Right now the emails have to all be sent before a success message is  
returned - no good for groups bigger than 100.

I've not used wp-cron before - does anyone know of good tutorials/ 
resources?

Is the GD image library or ImageMagik installed?

Perhaps you should hire a developer... or wait until there is
an official release?

Message-ID: <49149F9E.1090208@praizedmedia.com>

Just received 37 emails from buddypress for a friend confirmation 
action... you might want to look into that part of the codebase... Will 
try to reproduce this and if I can reliably repeat it will open a Trac 
ticket.

I think this is happening when the user hits the "accept" button  
multiple times. I will add a check to stop this.

Thanks for reporting.

Hi folks!
You can download the Italian Translation from http://buddypressitalia.com/file-lingua-italiana/
The site is still underconstruction, but the translation is complete.

Thanks for the italian file, I'm going to check it soon, but please remove
the hacked homepage from http://buddypressitalia.info/
It looks so bad ;-)
And if possible provide information about it, hacked from wpmu or something
related to the server configuration?

Thanks for the italian translation. Yes - please let us know the  
nature of that hack, if it's something BuddyPress related then it's  
very important.

Thanks

Hi,

Nick Grossman here from the Open Planning Project.  We produce and  
maintain a bunch of WP and WPMU sites, and are experimenting with  
Buddypress for one of our projects.

Question regarding group invitations:  right now, you can only invite  
your friends to be group members.  Are there plans to extend that to  
other site members, or people who haven't joined the site yet?

Thanks,
Nick
P.S., really liking Buddypress so far.  Keep up the good work!

Hi all!

i'm the owner of http://www.buddypress-it.it another support site for  
buddypress for the italian user...

i've made another translation (this works), the download direct link  
is: http://www.buddypress-it.it/download/1/

The site at the moment is under construction, sorry, but it will be  
online at most in the weekend...

Ah i've a problem traslating "WIRE" in the buddypress context, so if  
anyone have the right suggestion please contact me... Wire in the  
previous translation by another user has been translated "Bacheca" but  
it's wrong...

Thanks

Arturo.

It's very cool and it works! Thanks! But pay attention, because there
are some translations  in spanish (I've noticed it in the bp home's
sitewide activity).

Cheers,
Alessandro

Ok i've checked the spanish string but it isn't on the translation  
i've used the %s that print the time for example "registered %s ago"  
translated is "registrato %s fa" but it is "registrato 45minutos fa"  
whit the s at the end...

any suggestion to revolve this? thanks...

Arturo

Hi there,

We are developers from Curitiba, Brazil from Ethymos enterprise (
http://ethymos.com.br). We hace many works developed using WordPress and now
we have our first project using BuddyPress (http://soylocoporti.org.br). We
are improving day by day many issues on BuddyPress and we'd like post it in
SVN repository. How can we do this? What is the SVN access politics.

Thanks,

Yes, I've checked and it's not a translation's error. I can't see why
a variable should print something in spanish! LoL!

The easiest and quickest way is if you can open tickets for the issues  
you've addressed, and submit patch files. That way the changes can be  
checked, merged and committed to the code base easily.

I can change the "'s" part, as it's obviously not going to work for  
other languages.

Thanks Andy, but there aren't the ' with the s but only the s ... for  
example "registered 10 minutes ago" translated in italian is "  
registrato 10 minuti fa" but after the localization it is "registrato  
10 minutos fa" withous plural and with the s at the end... another  
example is "registrato 2 oras, 45 minutos fa" ora = hours not plural  
and with the s...

HI all,

it's possible have the psd of the BP's logo to make a little  
customization (the italian color) for the site buddypress-it.it ?

Andy this is possible? Thanks for the reply.

Arturo.

Today I tried to install buddypress, zipped version at skriffle.com but
everytime I end up with a error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined function bp_has_posts() in
/home/skriffle/domains/skriffle.com/public_html/wp-content/mu-plugins/bp-cor
e/admin-mods/bp-core-homebase-dashboard.php on line 28

The error occurs at: the dasjboard of a user. Under Latest Blog Posts.

If needed I can provide access to ssh or ftp on that server.

Somebody has a clue.

Peter

Version I downloaded first was at:

 

http://trac.buddypress.org/wiki/installing-buddypress which is the link at
the download page for zip generated files.

 

After I downloaded the link at the bottom of this page:

 

http://trac.buddypress.org/browser/trunk

 I may be wrong, but the zip files are a few revisions behind, trunk gives
    

you the most up to date (semi-stable) release.
 
Well, I stand corrected. :)

Subject: [buddypress-dev] moving an existing WP blog onto a BP install
Message-ID: <44f2b760811160026t1fc6c434s382cf960eb7fc6d1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I'm incredibly excited to see Buddypress getting so near to completion.

I have a question: I'm looking to launch an install in a space where there
are already people out there blogging on the topic.  If those people wanted
to bring their existing blogs onto the buddypress install, how would they do
that?

>From my days playing with Wordpress a few years back, I recall a way to
export a blog as XML that could then be imported into a new location.  Would
that be the only way to go? I guess I could offer to help people with that
as a service to encourage those interested in porting their blogs over.

Thanks for any advice.

-Brad Flora

Hi Brad,

Yes, if you're installing Wordpress MU and BuddyPress from scratch
(which I think is the best way to do it) then using the export/import
route to move blogs over would be best. Wordpress has a special export
facility that brings over comments as well, called WXR (Wordpress
eXtended RSS).

I've just used this method to move about 100 blogs to
http://wibsite.com with few problems.

Chris

Maybe I'm missing something here, but what happened to the "zip  
archive" of the trunk version? It doesn't seem to be on the trunk  
browser page anymore.

Search for some VPS hosting!
Slicehost and Linode seem to be the best at this moment.

Is anybody out there keen to install a couple of buddypress plugins on 
getshopped.com for us. We are way too busy to do it ourselves but I want 
to get it up and running for Christmas.

If anybody is interested in doing this for some cash (normal hourly 
rates) let me know.

I will publish all the results and everything we learn here so that we 
can all learn from the experience...

Ciao,

I'm also using trunk (but still rev 539) and I have problems with
multiple choice forms. When I select, for exemple, "radio button" any
more option appears and if I clock "Add" it says me that I have to add
some options in multiple choice forms...

Bye,
Alessandro

I think it makes more sense to make buddypress plugins that are 
compatible with WP e-Commerce.

What I want to do is make getshopped.com more social and I'm struggling 
with how to do it. Do you guys think that a good start would be to make 
a new groups page that members can join?

What are you thinking?

Ciao,

Dan

How about a Developer Community section of GetShopped? Users could create
groups for particular plugin-developments or themes, collaborate and share
idea's with other like minded developers. You could also have a WP
e-Commerse users community.

Cool idea!!! So users get to recommend products that get displayed on a 
new getshopped page called 'top products' or something?

This would be awesome too.

I'm scared of how much design work we're going to need to do on the 
front page of the site to make this cool :P

ust simple couple of questions? i have a shared host really cheap one  
with lunar pages?
I installed wpmu and realised that the subdomain function would work  
as i didn?t have access the Apache server and this means i cant ad the  
wildcard dns thingy.. so subdomains we out?
so i reinstaled using the sub directory? this worked fine..
i then tried to instal budypress with teh zip files.. as said in the  
readme?
with the blogs one it just gave a a parse syntax php ( or one of those  
php eror lines on a white page just saying something was wring on a  
line around 300 i forget exactely..) error that would not let me do
anything? so i deleted the blogs one and then it worked and i could ad  
a profile on the admin contol pannel but not on the splash page from  
register.. it first asked to creat a new blog then the profile so that  
didnt seem right..
questions.. does budy press work on sub directories and why was the  
blogs plugin not working..
i am trying to create a social site for spots or locations in kenya?
cheers..

i just tried again with a perfectly new instalation at bp.spotskenya.com

i get this error. in my browser window

Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '=', expecting ')' in /home/ 
rfmaf0/public_html/bp/wp-content/mu-plugins/bp-blogs/bp-blogs- 
templatetags.php on line 344

when i delete the blogs plugin it fixex this..

what am i doing wrong??

Kind regards,

Is there any way not to use those ugly looking avatars & monsterIDs, but 
just use specific one like "Mystery Man", as default?

Well yes, but I mean, some option would be nice to have. Same as it is on normal wp/wpmu.
Btw. I understand, that BP is extending WPMU with ability to upload locally own avatar, but it seems to me, that it duplicates gravatar functions as well, which I don't think is really necessary. But maybe i'm wrong on this.. ;)
Andy, please explain...

thanx

Yep, but this would put you streets ahead of many other similar sites.

One thing I'd like to see - especially on technology-related
e-commerce sites - is some kind of "Dream Machine" feature where
people can think up their perfect product configuration for a
particular scenario. That would probably be most useful for a PC
components site, but might work for other things as well.

You can also copy, I mean be influenced by, Amazon and have wishlists.
But you could make those more social by creating lists for other
people - and even keeping them secret. For example you could make a
list for your brother containing all the things he wants which people
could buy him for his birthday. If he doesn't know about the list,
it's a big surprise.

Lots of ideas for this.

Hello,

For all Russians and/or Ukrainians. I translate BP every time new version is
