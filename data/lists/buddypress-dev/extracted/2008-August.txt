Subject: [buddypress-dev] $bp global
Message-ID: <B846F0A0-685F-45A9-8CDD-8799AC814CD3@automattic.com>

I've just checked in updates to every component in trunk.

Up until now BuddyPress component settings have been stored in a  
number of global variables, all set in a number of different places  
(bad). I've now moved all settings under a "$bp" global variable.  
BuddyPress component settings are now added to $bp in a specific  
function for each component (better).

Global settings for each component are set in:

bp_core_setup_globals(), bp_xprofile_setup_globals(),  
bp_messages_setup_globals() etc etc.

You can check out what is stored, and the structure by using:

<?php print_r ( $bp ) ?> or <?php var_dump( $bp ) ?>

rather than having to hunt for a specific global.

If anyone is writing additional custom components (I know there are a  
few people) this is a major change, so you'll unfortunately need to  
make some updates. Sorry about that, it's better now than never!

Cheers
Andy

Subject: [buddypress-dev] A couple of bugs and possible fix for xprofile
Message-ID: <4ca2a7d0808081053k2b62c48dwbd135921813650e0@mail.gmail.com>

A couple of bug that you should consider:

#1
The cropper does not work in the right way on IE.
In the file cropper.css adding this line should avoid problems on IE

.crop-img {
    position:relative; /* ----------- IE ------- */
}

#2 Uploading the picture on registration, and cropping it during the
activation process create a different value on user data regarding
xprofile_avatar_v(1|2)
I'm using a little patch while recovering this data from the first blog of
the mu installation:
$img=(ereg($user->source_domain,$user->xprofile_avatar_v2))?$user->xprofile_avatar_v2:$user->source_domain.$user->xprofile_avatar_v2;
but you should consider to fix this bug on registration if possible

Good luck

Subject: [buddypress-dev] changing your user password via BuddyPress
Message-ID: <20080810160800.j7hohjsio0ssw8sk@www.dimensionmedia.com>

Hey all,

I was looking for a way to change your user login password WITHOUT  
going into wp-admin backend in the spirit of the BuddyPress template.

This is a ROUGH way of doing it (editing the core) but it seems to  
work. If anyone has suggestions for how to make this work without  
editting the core i'm all ears. Or maybe this can be a future addition.

What i did was simply create a profile group "advanced" with a textbox  
"desired password". Then I edited bp-xprofile.php around line 300  
after the IF statement (if($post_field_string != null)).

if ($group->id == 2 and $group->fields[$j]->id == 24) { // this is the  
password-update box, located in the advanced(2) group
									$ID = (int) $userdata->ID;

									// First, get all of the original fields
									$user = get_userdata($ID);

									// Escape data pulled from DB.
									$user = add_magic_quotes(get_object_vars($user));

									// If password is changing, hash it now.
									if ( ! empty($profile_data->value) ) {
										$plaintext_pass = $profile_data->value;
										$userdata->user_pass = wp_hash_password($profile_data->value);
									}

									// Merge old and new fields with new fields overwriting old ones.
									$userdata = array_merge($user, $userdata);
									$user_id = wp_insert_user($userdata);
							}

The reason why i'm not using wp's own function (wp_update_user) to  
change the data (which is where this code is actually being pulled) is  
because the wp_update_user attempts to clear/reset cookies and that  
causes header redirect errors because this is being doing in the  
middle of rendering the BuddyPress template page.

Like I said, this is rough but so far works. There are better ways and  
i'm open to hearing them.

Hmm... there must be a way around that. I will take a look at this  
pretty soon, as I'd like to start bringing user settings into the  
template. "Disable notification emails" etc.

Message-ID: <1684114074.1562581218822118062.JavaMail.root@mail-3.01.com>

I would like to see the messages and other features like friends, groups and others in backend of WPMU. The reason I asked for it because if my users decide to choose different themes to use then they wont be able to access groups or other features at all.

I love the way the theme designed but too many columns for menus when I view the blog section. Is anyone going to be able to redesign the theme different from the default buddypress theme?

I developed our own vlog and video comments applications for WPMU and WP v2.6 which we will be using it with buddypress. I hope to see more mods designed for buddypress very soon before I put WPMU in public with buddypress features. How far will it be ready to get out of BETA?

Thanks,

Hey Jed - 

Some of the back-end menu items are disabled in the code.  I haven?t tested
it myself yet, but you may want to uncomment the ones you see fit..

I?m looking for a video plugin myself. Are you willing share the plugin you
created?

Cheers!

I am not sure if we are allowed to share bec I worked with a company that already offered a plugin as vlog but we spent money to customized it differently and added video comments solution also being able to host on my own instead rely on 3rd party companies to manage it unreliability.

I ll look into script to see if I cld uncomment some lines to appear it in backend. Hope it ll work! I still think that we need widgets to show menu of buddypress features on any themes.

Thanks! Jed

The backend menus are commented out as the theme fuctionality is being  
worked on first. The back end menus wern't yet working correctly, so  
they were disabled.

You can uncomment the menus definitely, but they are unlikely to work  
until the best way to mirror theme functionality is worked out. They  
will be coming back though.

Thanks for the info! My vlog application is based on a webcam recorder player built-in the backend to record different videos directly to wp. It has several options to set up in different ressolutions, sizes, color and style of players and post on their blogs.

Im going to start the wpmu hosting with buddypress features and my apps soon as beta testing in public. Love wordpress due to lots of excellent mods better than facebook's apps :)

Subject: [buddypress-dev] BuddyPress compatibility with WPMU 2.6?
Message-ID: <48AA1A45.2090102@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just joined this list as I am working on a WPMU project to build a 
blog community site with requirements that fit exactly with the features 
BuddyPress provides, such as extended profiles, private messaging, 
friends and groups.

I want to use WPMU 2.6+ for this project but realised that the current 
release of BuddyPress does not work correctly with the Mu release.

So, I'm just wondering how far away is the compatibility update for 
BuddyPress and WPMu 2.6? Does the current BuddyPress SVN version perhaps 
work already with Mu2.6?

Thanks in advance and sorry if this has been answered somewhere, I 
couldn't find any conclusive info about this.

Oh, it would be really nice to say on the BuddyPress Trac download page 
what version of WPMu is supported :).


Kind regards,
Robert

I have exatly the same question. We are working on integrating WPMU with our
existing community infrastructure and we are seriously considering
buddypress to replace some of our custom stuff, but doesn't seem to be
compatible with 2.6, is it something you are going to fix very soon?

I?m using WPMU 2.6 and everything works as expected.. What issues are you
having?  Keep in mind that not all functionality has been completed. Please
check the previous posts and the Roadmap for details..

Andy (Buddypress?s king developer) is running on 2.6 as well for his test
site.. Check it out http://testdrivewpmu.com/

Cheers!

Hi Brian,

thanks for the thumbs up. I just tried a brand new install of WPMu2.6 + 
BuddyPress latest download (not SVN) and I can see the "Profiles" link 
now in the Site Admin. This was not available when I installed 
BuddyPress on another Mu2.6 install which had a few blogs already. Not 
sure if the sequence of installing things matter here? Also, is it 
essential to install the BuddyPress theme for the setup to execute 
correctly (as I haven't done that for my original install)...

Lucky that I'm at the early stages of my project so I can just reinstall 
my client development site from scratch and get BuddyPress going.

The question is, is there a caveat when installing BuddyPress on and 
existing WPMu install? Can it be added if a WPMu site is in "full swing" 
or is that a risk at this stage?

Ahh, the life on the razor's edge, eh :).

Thanks for the good work though. I'm looking forward to my experience 
with this software.

Regards,
Robert

Hi Robert, 

I have been testing on a new instance of 2.6 myself, so I can say for sure
that it will work on a existing/ working install. However, since Buddypress
doesn?t appear to alter existing Wordpress tables I don?t see a reason for
it to cause any problems. Nor have any adverse affects if the plugins are
removed from the MU-Plugins folder.

I agree with you, Buddypress is amazing project. Andy (and contributors)
have done an incredible job with the development and implementation. I have
gone to bed many nights with a huge smile after seeing just a simple
addition was made to Buddypress.

One note. The ?home? theme should be applied to the Admin users theme. If it
isn?t and the ?default? theme is used it will display 404 errors when logged
on as ?Admin?. Any other user will work fine. The good news, when a  user
creates an account the ?Default? theme is applied. From my understanding the
home theme is just a place holder, with a bit of functionality. (blog,
register, login, etc.)

- Brian

I'll chime in a little here. Almost all the development so far has  
gone on the notion of people using it on a fresh installation of MU.

I know there are a lot of people out there who want to drop BuddyPress  
into an existing blog network (of course this will be of the features  
of BuddyPress).

Now seems to be a good time to start going back over what has been  
done and put the parts in place that will let BuddyPress start to  
support existing installs. I'll be looking at this over the next  
couple of weeks (I'm on vacation next week), then moving onto the next  
components.

Specific things that will be looked at:

   - Supporting existing themes - stopping the 404's when template  
files don't exist. The back end functionality tabs will need to be re- 
enabled for this. Currently it's the default theme or nothing.

   - Writing code to assign a subdomain or subfolder as your "home  
base" and all others as blogs you belong to. This should solve the  
user-vs-blog centric problem.

   - Making sure that BP template tags can be used on any template  
file, under any page slug. Right now profile information can only be  
rendered under domain.com/user/profile for example. This won't work  
for a lot of people. Sollaires opened a ticket for this exact problem  
recently with a potential fix - http://trac.buddypress.org/ticket/55

Does anyone have any comments on any of this?

Cheers,
Andy

Hi Brian,

yes, I am getting some action out of BuddyPress now :).

I also figured out what was happening to my first attempt (when I didn't 
see the "Profiles" link in the admin). My site home blog wasn't set as 
the default blog for the admin user! Good to keep that in mind.

Also, it was confusing to receive the 404's when logged in as admin. 
This must be intentional? Does that mean that if the admin wants to 
participate in the site community, they need to create another account 
for themselves?

Anyhow, thanks for the replies.

Robert

Message-ID: <48ABBF27.2000306@gmail.com>

I'm not sure if this is the place to be asking questions about how to do 
this and that in BuddyPress (and please point me to the right place if 
it isn't).

I've got Mu set up to use subdomains. Now, when BP is installed, when 
you go to the root: user.domain.tld/ you get the profile by default. How 
can I achieve to get the blog to be displayed as the default?

Thanks,
Robert

Hi Robert, 

You can change the default page by opening home.php in the themes folder and
change the code to:

<?php // Do we want the blog or profile as home? Check will go here. if (
$current_component == 'blog' ) :    include_once (TEMPLATEPATH .
'/blog.php'); else :    include_once (TEMPLATEPATH . '/blog.php'); endif; ?>

Hi Brian,

hm, that doesn't appear to work. I played around with that file already. 
It appears that the default/profile/index.php takes over in any case... 
not sure where it is decided that everything should go to the profile...

Hi Andy,

I don't know much about BuddyPress yet to make suggestions but, I guess 
it would be good to have the ability to configure the way BP hooks into 
Mu. For example, on a default Mu site, the site blog homes are just 
their subdomains (or subdirectories if VHOST=no). But BP changes that. I 
hacked around to add a new option under BuddyPress to allow setting if 
the blog or the profile should be the default home...

In the course of my current project, I will certainly get under the hood 
of BuddyPress and be able to contribute more...

Cheers,
Robert

Hey there, I'm setting up my first bpress test install and right after I
switched over to the bpress theme, I received this error.  Do I not have the
buddypress tables installed?  I wondered about that.

How do I fix this?

The install instructions are somewhat vague about how the buddypress tables
are installed.  Instead of having them be automatically isntalled at some
indeterminate point when I log in, what if I had a button I could press to
install them from the admin?

It's just a case of adding the correct hooks in place, so that the  
tables will be set up as soon as you hit the site. That way there is  
no need for this. Normal WordPress plugins create their tables upon  
activation - but of course mu-plugins are automatically activated.

Great, please feel free to share any work! I will be working on blog/ 
user home options in the next couple of weeks.

Great! Feel free to take a shot at any of the functionality on the  
roadmap, or test, bug fix, whatever you feel like really. :)

I'm in the process of commenting most functions in BuddyPress, so  
understanding the code should begin to get easier from now on.

Cheers

Hi Andy,

what's the best way to share any code?

Two ways really. The best, if you can manage it, is to create a patch  
file. This is a file that can be merged with the current code base and  
easily reviewed and tested.

A how to is here:
http://laughingmeme.org/2004/02/18/how-to-make-a-patch-file/

Once you have created the patch file, you can create a new ticket at: http://trac.buddypress.org 
  (login with your WP.org forums user/pass). Describe the problem it  
fixes and attach the patch file.

If it is only a really small amount of code, then you can always paste  
it into an email here on the list.

Cheers
Andy

BuddyPress in under development. If there is no plugin for download, 
that means it hasn't been released yet. So, you won't find the album 
anywhere...

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Profile without blog?
Message-ID: <48B0D1B7.9040707@gmail.com>

WPMu has an option at sign-up to allow the user to choose if they want a 
blog or just a username. With BudsdyPress installed, when I tried to 
sign up without creating a blog, my user still received a blog along 
with the account. Is it not possible to omit the creation of a blog when 
BuddyPress is active? Ideally I'd like to allow users to choose whether 
they want a blog or not (or specify an external blog) and yet in all 
cases I want them to have a BuddyPress profile... is this possible?

Cheers,
Robert

Apparently, the devs have commented those out on purpose. You will need 
to edit the code files and uncomment them back... Not sure what 
consequences that might have...

I don't have the link handy, but if you search the wpmu forums, there
are some older threads about this kind of stuff.  The primary 2
methods either require using a script that automatically posts data to
the sign-up form (though posts about this are often deleted or derided
as being only needed by spam bloggers), or hacking the wpmu core just
a little bit to allow the wpmu_create_blog() function to work more
than once in a script (I believe Vinn or Vim is a user who has posted
some patch files in the wpmu trac).

I have a very hacked together shell script along with a few changes to
the wpmu core that allows me to automatically import users in my
primary system into wpmu/bp install, however the code is very hacky
and not really production ready.  In order to add BP-specific user
data, I basically copied some code that appears in the sign-up form to
create the BP Profile fields.  I also have to do some funky stuff with
$_SERVER to make the wordpress files believe it's being run from a web
page and not a shell script.  And also make sure I'm very careful with
any local variable names since they are all in the global scope.  As I
said, really, really hacky.

The basic answer is that it's not simple (and given the tenor of
responders to questions like these in the wpmu community, never will
be simple) but it can be done.  I don't have access to my code atm,
but I could possibly post some examples of what I've done some time
next week if there is interest.

Nope, you're right - it's not simple. Primarily because WordPressMU 
handles users differently than WordPress.

Even moving users manually via database records, I still have issues. 
And that's even before creating a bunch of blogs. :-/

We're still in the early stages of BP development, and even MU has a few 
things that need fixing. That's part of the reason too.

Subject: [buddypress-dev] Import Users?!?!?
Message-ID: <1004105654.628651220112126752.JavaMail.root@mail-3.01.com>

No custom script to do it easily for us? I guess we better off to register them as user with blog ready. I ll find a way to make the process invisible as user but it ll register them with blogs ready til we make it available. Im ready to launch a beta site with buddypress to test it out with multiple db from wpmu premium.

Thanks! I ll post a url where I ll begin my bp community! Can't wait to see albums and others fully integrated for testing til dec 1st 08. Hope it ll be the official date of release!
