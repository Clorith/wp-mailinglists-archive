I can't see this feature listed on\nthe website.\n2) Are there already website (production) that are using this buddypress ?\nThanks !\n-- \nSimone Fumagalli\n-----------------------------------------------\nTomato Interactive\nVia Natale Battaglia 10 - 20127 Milano (Italy)\nTel. +39.02.2831181\nhttp://www.tomato.it - http://www.contactlab.it\n-----------------------------------------------\nContactLab - E-mail \u0026 E-marketing Evolution",

        "body": "Last night I checked in revision 28 of BuddyPress. This version is now  \nrunning on http://testdrivewpmu.com for  those who want to give it a  \nrun through.\nRevisions include:\n- Multiple blog support: members of your network can now sign up and  \nrun more than one blog. Their primary account is used as their 'home'  \nwhere they can manage their friends/groups/messages etc. Other blogs  \njust contain the normal WordPress blogging features. Their home  \naccount stays as the first tab in their admin interface and is marked  \nwith a user icon.\n- New 'Blog' tab with no loss of WPMU features. I've completely  \nrevised the blog tab and simply bumped down all blog related tabs one  \nlevel. This means all features found in WPMU are accessible and have  \nnot been renamed or moved.\n- Site admin settings for BuddyPress have been moved under the 'Site  \nAdmin' tab. There was no point in creating another site administration  \ntab.\n- Member level settings for components have been introduced and blog  \nsettings have been dropped down one level to \"Settings\u003eBlog\".\n- I've introduced two site administration settings for BuddyPress  \nunder \"Site Admin\u003eBuddyPress\". The first lets you completely turn off  \nthe 'Blog' tab and stick with the default WPMU tab layout. The second  \nlets you disable the 'Design' tab site wide for all members (other  \nthan site admins).\nNext Steps:\nMy next steps are to go through the code at this stage and bring it  \ninto line with the Wordpress Coding Standards, to keep things  \nconsistent. This will mean a change in filenames, if you are keeping  \nup to date using SVN then this shouldn't cause a problem.\nAndy\n---------\nAndy Peatling | Social Engineer | Automattic\nhttp://andyinlife.com",

I have a number of\nsites which run it and love to hack it up and re-work it. Things you\njust can't do with other publishing platforms.\nI have 2 WP powered projects in the pipeline, one taking longer than\nexpected which I may swap over to buddypress if it will help me get\nthings moving.\nThat's about it for now.

Once a user\nprofile was generated, it's entry will be listed in\n`bp_core_get_users()` results. So basically, querying\n`bp_core_get_users()` you will get all the BuddyPress users.\nIf you want to make it even better, you can also check the User object\nattributes `user_registered` and `last_activity`.\nhttp://chopapp.com/#c8jvi473",

    "subject": "[buddypress-dev] Portable friends",
    "body": "Hi,\nI've been thinking about the data portability issue recently and would\nlike some input on the 'friends' aspect. Some of the discussion so far\nshows that some of the functionality required by a social network\n'friends' feature can be handled well by the existing Wordpress\nblogroll: which can contain a list of URIs which can be tagged with\nXFN. One of the things BuddyPress could do (and also make a wider\nWordpress plugin) is handle the import/export and synchronisation of\nthese lists through OPML. That's relatively straightforward.\nHowever there are other things that a friends application does that a\nblogroll (currently) can't. Off the top of my head here's a few:\n- Display the current status of each friend\n- Display the latest post from each friend\n- Show what topics your friends have been posting on\n- Display recently-added photos from friends\n- Compare favourites etc. with friends\nI'm sure there are lots more (each of these may need a separate format\nso they can be implemented separately). When the user and their\nfriends are in the same system, i.e. the same database, it's pretty\neasy to make all these things happen - it's just a question of SQL\nqueries. But if these friends are going to be spread about not just\naround the same site, but also blogs and other SNs then things start\nto get hairy. The amount of data that could need to be transmitted\nevery time a user wants to check for their friends updates could be\nprohibitive for site admins wanting this feature.\nSo my thoughts are that a users friends list *shouldn't* go to their\nfriends to see if data has changed. Instead when someone, for example,\nupdates their status that new text should be sent to anyone in their\nfriends list. Here's an example.\nBob and Dave are friends. Dave updates his status text, and the change\ngets posted (using RPC?) to all of Dave's friends, including Bob. The\nnext time Bob logs in he sees Dave's latest status.\nThis minimises the amount of remote polling because friends' sites are\nonly called when there is has been an update made - not to check if\nthere *has* been an update made. It can also be made secure, because a\nuser could set their status updates to \"everyone\", but their photo\ngallery updates only to \"family\".\nLastly it puts the status of the friendship under the data senders\ncontrol. Another example:\nJack has said he is Jill's friend. But Jill isn't Jack's friend, ever\nsince that part at Bob's house where he got a bit frisky by the punch\nbowl. Jack might want to know when Jill updates her status message so\nhe can harass her, but he isn't going to get those notifications\nautomatically because he isn't in Jill's friends list. And because\nJack isn't in Jill's friends list she can say whether she wants to see\nnotifications from him or not, by leaving the \"View updates from\npeople who say they are your friend (but you haven't said you are\ntheirs)?\" box unchecked.\nAny thoughts?\nChris",

Some of the discussion so far\n\u003e  shows that some of the functionality required by a social network\n\u003e  'friends' feature can be handled well by the existing Wordpress\n\u003e  blogroll: which can contain a list of URIs which can be tagged with\n\u003e  XFN. One of the things BuddyPress could do (and also make a wider\n\u003e  Wordpress plugin) is handle the import/export and synchronisation of\n\u003e  these lists through OPML. That's relatively straightforward.\n\u003e\n\u003e  However there are other things that a friends application does that a\n\u003e  blogroll (currently) can't. Off the top of my head here's a few:\n\u003e\n\u003e  - Display the current status of each friend\n\u003e  - Display the latest post from each friend\n\u003e  - Show what topics your friends have been posting on\n\u003e  - Display recently-added photos from friends\n\u003e  - Compare favourites etc. with friends\n\u003e\n\u003e  I'm sure there are lots more (each of these may need a separate format\n\u003e  so they can be implemented separately). When the user and their\n\u003e  friends are in the same system, i.e. the same database, it's pretty\n\u003e  easy to make all these things happen - it's just a question of SQL\n\u003e  queries. But if these friends are going to be spread about not just\n\u003e  around the same site, but also blogs and other SNs then things start\n\u003e  to get hairy. The amount of data that could need to be transmitted\n\u003e  every time a user wants to check for their friends updates could be\n\u003e  prohibitive for site admins wanting this feature.\n\u003e\n\u003e  So my thoughts are that a users friends list *shouldn't* go to their\n\u003e  friends to see if data has changed. Instead when someone, for example,\n\u003e  updates their status that new text should be sent to anyone in their\n\u003e  friends list. Here's an example.\n\u003e\n\u003e  Bob and Dave are friends.

    "body": "Hi Everyone,\nIn September I have asked a few questions on how I could localize\nBuddyPress, I figured out how things are working and it looks like I got the\nhang of it.\nHowever I do have a few small questions:\n   - Is it possible to easily reuse the WP language file in WPMU? When I\n   tried to use the WP file as a starting point and updated it with the php\n   code I'm loosing a lot of the translations :-(\n   - Is it possible to use multiple Language files? At the moment I got the\n   impression that I need to have 1 file, containing all the translations. I\n   think it would be more convenient to have seperate language files, each part\n   (like WPMU, buddypress, bbpress, etc) having it's own language file.\nI have asked these questions to the people involved in the dutch translation\nof WP, but they aren't responding at all, so that's why I'm bothering you\nwith these questions.\nHappy Holidays,\nKind regards,\nFlorin\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/buddypress-dev/attachments/20081223/df7bb53f/attachment.htm",

    "subject": "[buddypress-dev] Updates",
    "body": "Since it's been a little while since I've checked anything in, I  \nthought I'd update everyone on what I've personally been working on  \nfor the past couple of weeks.\nThere has been a fair amount of talk about how BuddyPress will support  \nexisting blog network installations, as well as new installs. My  \nprimary focus for the past two weeks has been on introducing proper  \nsupport for existing blog networks.\nHere's what I've done:\nEvery user of an existing install (whether they have a blog or not)  \nwill need to sign up for a \"Home Base\". This is essentially a blog,  \nbut *without* any blogging features at all. Current members will see a  \n\"Create Home Base\" tab in their admin area once BuddyPress is  \ninstalled, where they can follow simple steps to create a home base.  \nOnce they have created a home base, the tab will disappear.\nThe default BuddyPress theme will be used for all home bases, where as  \nany blog theme can be used for any other blogs. The home base  \nrepresents the user as a person, and will contain all of their  \nBuddyPress data (profile, messages .. ). The admin area for the home  \nbase will contain tabs for profile, messages, groups, friends and so  \non. No blog tabs. One home base to one user.\nOf course, custom BuddyPress enabled themes could be used for user's  \nhome base. It may even be possible to let users select from BuddyPress  \nenabled themes for their home base in the future. The plan is to make  \nit easy to \"BuddyPress enable\" existing WordPress themes.\nNo blogging features on the home base means no blog in the default  \nBuddyPress theme. This has all been removed. However, in its place is  \na \"Blogs\" menu item. This contains 3 sub items:\n  - My Blogs - which lists every blog you have privileges for in the  \nnetwork.\n  - Recent Posts - Lists the last 10 posts you have made across any  \nblog in the network\n  - Recent Comments - Lists the last 25 comments you have made across  \nany blog in the network\nNow, for new installations this means users are first signing up for a  \nhome base rather than a blog. They would then create their first blog  \nonce their account and home base is activated and set up.\nInterestingly - this gives site administrators the option to  \ncompletely leave out blogging functionality from their BuddyPress  \ninstallation if they wish.\nI have created a new component \"bp-blogs\" that will eventually provide  \nthe ability to enable/disable blogging functionality. At the moment it  \nis tracking and recording posts, comments, and blogs for users across  \nan installation.\nAlso:\nI have included an \"admin bar\" that will persist across the top of all  \nscreens in a BuddyPress enabled install. The bar is almost identical  \nto the one you see on WordPress.com. The menu includes quick drop down  \nlinks to BuddyPress component functionality, and very soon quick links  \nto blog author profiles/friends/groups etc when viewing a blog.\nIf some or all of the above doesn't make any sense, it will once you  \nsee the new functionality working. By making the user assign  \nthemselves a home base, the problem of \"blog centric vs user centric\"  \nshould be eliminated.\nCheers,\nAndy\n---------\nAndy Peatling | Social Engineer | Automattic\nhttp://apeatling.wordpress.com",

My thoughts and opinions on this are changing now,\n\u003e having talked more to the community, and seen the potential to make\n\u003e something different from the norm.\nUsers being able to tweak their BuddyPress theme(s) is fantastic, as is\nusers having their own themes on an installation, but I would also like to\necho the thoughts of others earlier that I hope that BuddyPress allows as an\noption for a uniform look and cohesion, which users them can change if they\nwish and if the admin will allow them.\nAll the projects I would like to attempt with it would require that.\n**Personalized activity feed**\nSecondly, the core features that BuddyPress have now does not seem to\ninclude an activity feed.

Another method that wouldn't alter the existing WPMU\nschema would be to use a bp_privacy table, and while this makes\nintercepting, parsing and altering sql queries potentially more\ntroublesome, it does have the advantage of allowing setting\npermissions on arbitrary data that doesn't neatly correspond to\nsetting row level security on existing data such as user_email from\nwp_users or other non-extended profile data in wp_usermeta.\nEven if being able to privatize content such as posts, pages, links,\netc. doesn't seem all that important, I really think end users will\nappreciate being able to change the privacy settings of their profile\ndata.

I  \nknow that Justin Ball is also interested in contributing in this area,  \nso lets see how we can put our collective heads together on this one.  \nI'll be in IRC all day tomorrow - #buddypress on Freenode. Lets  \ndiscuss how we can get this component moving forward.\n\u003e 1. How fine-grained should the privacy options be?  Since it seems I\n\u003e read something every week or so about some social network offering\n\u003e more fine-grained control over privacy options (to be fair, it is\n\u003e usually Facebook making an about-face after changing something\n\u003e private-by-default to public-by-default and recoiling from user\n\u003e backlash), this seems like a good place to consider both the existing\n\u003e BP framework and potential future BP enhancements. As an example,\n\u003e while I've never looked at XFN in depth, will XFN potentially be used\n\u003e as a basis for determining BP friendships?  To start off with, I think\n\u003e the following non-mutually-exclusive options should be available as\n\u003e they correspond with what I hopefully understand BP's capabilities:\n\u003e a) Public\n\u003e b) Logged in WPMU users\n\u003e c) Logged in friends\n\u003e d) Members of specified groups\n\u003e e) Nobody (really only the content creator, but \"nobody\" is probably\n\u003e less confusing to most end users)\n\u003e\n\u003e Potentially a f) friends of friends - kind of a sql nightmare in\n\u003e having to join the bp_friends table several times to itself to search\n\u003e for permutations of initiator_user_id and friend_user_id.\nI'd like to see fine grained privacy as it gives the user the greatest  \nlevel of control. However, I saw a talk by Chris Messina here at the  \nOpen Web Vancouver conference today. He mentioned only 25% of Facebook  \nusers have ever looked the privacy options page. As much as giving  \nusers fine control over their privacy, it also needs to be simple,  \notherwise people won't understand and/or use it.\nI like the idea of tagging, and then giving the option to apply  \nprivacy settings to those tags. This allows you to be as fine grained  \nwith privacy as you want. These tags could be applied to friendships,  \nblog posts, photos etc. Using XFN is an option and perhaps using XFN  \ndefined relationships as pre-defined tags? Currently I don't  \nunderstand this area well enough either, however.\nWe could also provide generic options such as you mentioned, \"Public\",  \n\"Only My Friends\", \"Logged in Users\" for those members who aren't  \nconcerned with fine grained control.\n\u003e 2. What existing and potentially future planned types of content can\n\u003e be privatized?  Items in the posts tables seem like a no-brainer.\n\u003e Either extended individual profile pieces of data or possibly entire\n\u003e extended profile groups seem like they should also allow to be\n\u003e privatized, as this would allow for someone to set something like a\n\u003e phone number or the \"contact\" group to only be viewable by friends\n\u003e instead of people intentionally leaving some fields blank (phone\n\u003e number, email \u0026 home addresses, etc.) to prevent identity theft or\n\u003e potential harassment. (As changing profile privacy settings should be\n\u003e on the same admin page as changing the actual profile data, the\n\u003e xprofile_edit function would have to be altered to support this.)\nJust off the top of my head:\nProfile data, profile data groups, blog posts, pages, links, photos,  \nalbums, wire posts, status updates, groups joined...\n\u003e 3. Answers to the above questions will go along way in determining the\n\u003e best methods for storing/accessing privacy data, but do you have a\n\u003e preferred method of storing this data?  The seemingly normal WP method\n\u003e would be to store it as a serialized array, and that can be easily\n\u003e done by adding a \"restricted_to\" or similarly named field to each\n\u003e table that contains something to be privatized (this wouldn't\n\u003e currently work on allowing bp_groups privacy settings on a user by\n\u003e user basis).

That is expensive.\nWhat I've done is created a function that will query the DB for the  \nspecific values you want. This should be *a lot* faster.\nI'm going to check the function into the trunk later today, it can be  \nused as follows:\nbp_get_field_data( $field_names [, $user_id] );\n$field_names = Either a string containing the name of the field, or an  \narray of field names.\n$user_id = Optional. This will default to the id for the current user  \nbeing viewed, or you can pass an id for a specific user.\nThe function will return a string containing the field value if you  \nonly pass one field. It will return an array of values with the field  \nname as the key if you pass an array of field names.\nExamples:\n\u003c?php echo bp_get_field_data( 'First Name' ); ?\u003e\n\u003c?php\n   $profile_data = bp_get_field_data( array( 'First Name', 'Last  \nName', 'Home Town' ) );\n   echo 'First Name: ' . $profile_data['First Name'];\n   echo 'Last Name: ' . $profile_data['Last Name'];\n   echo 'Home Town: ' . $profile_data['Home Town'];\n?\u003e\nThat should hopefully satisfy the need to select and render specific  \nprofile fields rather than just looping them all.\nI may include this function in a 0.3.3 release of extended profiles.\n\u003e This works for single-value profile values such as textboxes and  \n\u003e select dropdowns. Looking for ways to improve the function when it  \n\u003e comes to multiple-value values which would look like this in the  \n\u003e output (assuming the values \"online\" and \"local\" are selected):\n\u003e\n\u003e a:2:{i:0;s:6:\"Online\";i:1;s:5:\"Local\";}\nunserialize() will do that.\nCheers\nAndy\n---------\nAndy Peatling | Social Engineer | Automattic\nhttp://andyinlife.com",

For instance - if you run the tagged 0.2 version of the core  \nand then try and install the latest friends component, things will  \nbreak.\nSo just to make sure everyone gets that - if you want to run the  \nbleeding edge stuff - install everything in trunk, and nothing in the  \ntags directory. However, if you're happy to run more stable component  \nversions and are okay to wait until new components are tagged... don't  \ninstall anything from the trunk.\n  - I can't guarantee anything is going to run on a windows server. I  \nhave no windows servers to test with. If you want to run BuddyPress  \nthen you'll need a linux/apache server for now.\n- Lastly, groups will be re-structured to fit the style of the other  \ncomponents. It will also not show anything in the default theme yet.  \nI'm getting to it ASAP.\nCheers\nAndy\nOn 15-Jul-08, at 10:23 PM, Tobias Schwarz wrote:\n\u003e Hi,\n\u003e\n\u003e I've installed WPMU/Buddypress (current SVN version) on a local  \n\u003e windows\n\u003e XAMPP-run server, and WPMU seems to work fine - although that's  \n\u003e difficult to\n\u003e determine for me as I've never worked with WPMU before (just on WP).\n\u003e Initially, the buddypress plugins seemed to produce more errors than  \n\u003e I could\n\u003e count, but it seems a lot of that is due to configuration issues.\n\u003e\n\u003e It's still very buggy, but at least I've managed to get a profile up  \n\u003e and\n\u003e running now.\n\u003e\n\u003e That said - I still have the avatar uploading issues some people have\n\u003e complained about - the image is uploaded and the cropper works, but  \n\u003e the\n\u003e variables constructed and put in the DB aren't correct - this is the  \n\u003e URL in\n\u003e the db\n\u003e\n\u003e D:\\Programme\\xampp\\htdocs\\kuk/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files//2008/07/ \n\u003e kopie-vo\n\u003e n-504553_52097412-avatar1.jpg\n\u003e\n\u003e As you can see there's two slashes between files and 2008, and the  \n\u003e ABSPATH\n\u003e is using backslashes.

Instead of invoking the  \n$authordata variable and using that to render the profile, we are  \nmatching the blog domain/path to the user.\nSo, if you visit \"andy.buddypress.org\" it will take the \"andy\" part  \nand display the profile for the user \"andy\". That way, only the  \nprofile for the user that signed up with this blog will be shown. You  \ncan still assign new administrators/contributors/authors etc etc, but  \nthe owners profile will only ever show.\nI've made this change and it seems to be working well for both  \nsubdomains and subfolders. It should also in theory fix the problems  \npeople have been having with links, pages and categories.\nI will be checking this in shortly, and hoping to tag a v0.2 of the  \nextended profile component ASAP. We still have a bunch of bugs to fix  \nwith some new feature additions.\n---------\nAndy Peatling | Social Engineer | Automattic\nhttp://andyinlife.com",

The back end functionality tabs will need to be re-enabled for\n\u003e\u003e this. Currently it's the default theme or nothing.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e  - Writing code to assign a subdomain or subfolder as your \"home base\" and\n\u003e\u003e all others as blogs you belong to. This should solve the user-vs-blog\n\u003e\u003e centric problem.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e  - Making sure that BP template tags can be used on any template file,\n\u003e\u003e under any page slug.

In fact, the\n\u003e\u003e plan right now is to limit one user to one blog. With BuddyPress, the\n\u003e\u003e administration area represents the person, and not the blog. This\n\u003e\u003e causes a problem when administering multiple blogs. Which admin area\n\u003e\u003e would you go to to check your messages or add a new photo?\n\u003e\n\u003e While I see the reason for this, I'm concerned about being able to\n\u003e drop buddypress into already existing mu installs.  I know one on\n\u003e install that I host, there's a great deal of users who have access to\n\u003e multiple blogs as either admins or authors.  Have to admit that this\n\u003e will be a show stopper for us and I think a number of other folks.\n\u003e I'm rather surprised no one else has spoken up about this.\n\u003e\n\u003e Will there be any attempt to allow multiple blogs where they already  \n\u003e exist?\n\u003e\nI've been chatting with Chris a lot about exactly this. I'm going to  \nspend the\nnext couple of days and see if it is feasible to support multiple  \nblogs right now.\nWe had two ideas, one fairly easy, one much harder:\n1. Make use of the existing blog switcher. Make sure that the primary  \nblog ID\nis tracked so that BuddyPress components only appear on the user's own  \nadmin\narea. Other blogs the user has access to would just contain the  \nnecessary blog\ntabs.\n2. Provide a blog switcher via the blog tab. When a user clicks on the  \nblog tab\nthey are presented with a list of the blogs they belong to. They can  \nselect one\nand then continue to carry out actions for that blog. Users with just  \none blog\nwould never see this. Right now, I'm not sure this is even possible  \nwithin a\nplugin. It would however mean you'd never have to leave your own  \npersonal admin\narea.\nI'll keep everyone updated on how this progresses.\nAndy",

Would it be possible to export all my post in WP to BuddyPress?\nbuddypress isn't another software, but a regular WPMU with some  \nplugins. so, it share the same import/export xml standard of  \nWordPress. you can export from WP and import in WPMU, just make sure  \nto use the same version of the xml (WP 2.3.x  = WPMU 1.3.x)\n\u003e 2.

Now, I'm looking \nfor the best way to implement the administration of this field.\nOne idea is to use the normal BuddyPress profile fields but then it \nwould be difficult to create some custom logic around the admin of that \nas I want to provide a button to discover the RSS feed and verify it etc.\nThe other idea is to write a custom plugin that provides a menu item on \nthe Home Base dashboard called \"External Blog\" and do all my custom \nstuff there which would be perfect. Now, I see that buddypress hijacks \nthe normal WP dashboard rendering and does it's own thing so the \nquestion is, how can I hook into that and add my own menu item and code \nthe actions for it? Can I still use the add_menu_page() function for \nthis or do I have to do something else?\nThanks,\nRobert",

Surely this is a great idea for a\n\u003e  plugin.  How do you think this is best done -- create, say, a public group\n\u003e and hook into BuddyPress so it isn't displayed in the group directory, etc?\n\u003e Another way I can see is to create a new record in wp_bb_forums but I\n\u003e imagine the BP group directory would iterate through the records and try to\n\u003e find a group based on the forum_name; what happens if it fails?\n\u003e\n\u003e Thanks\n\u003e Paul Gibbb\n\u003e s\n\u003e _______________________________________________\n\u003e buddypress-dev mailing list\n\u003e buddypress-dev at lists.automattic.com\n\u003e http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/buddypress-dev\n\u003e\n\u003e\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: \u003chttp://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/buddypress-dev/attachments/20100511/6abf8557/attachment.htm\u003e",

Profile avatars can now be cropped to  \ntwo different sizes.\n* The extended profile component is now closing in on being feature  \ncomplete. Justin Ball and Trenton Cameron are working on some  \nadditional features as outlined inhttp://trac.buddypress.org/ticket/12\n* The extended profile component now includes fully functional  \ntemplate tags. This means profile data can be rendered easily in  \nexisting themes.\n* The messaging component has been completely re-written. Messages are  \nnow threaded and viewed in a conversational style. The component now  \nmakes use of the included Wordpress AJAX hooks for inline replying to  \nmessages.\n* Beau is working on \"to:\" field AJAX autocompletion that will  \nautocomplete both friend names and group names.\n* After a lengthy discussion in #buddypress on IRC, I am putting  \ntogether a development roadmap this week. This will outline the  \nfunctionality we want completed for each tagged release. I will be  \nadding this to trac. I have just today tagged version 0.1 at:http://svn.buddypress.org/tags/\n* The groups component is being worked on by Chris Taylor when he has  \nspare time. He has done a great job integrating his work with the  \nBuddyPress environment so far. The next step with this component is to  \ncreate custom template tags so that groups can be rendered within  \nthemes. Once I have completed my work on the messaging component I  \nwill be helping Chris with this.\n----------\nI will be emailing the list once the roadmap is complete. This should  \ngive people a solid idea on feature breakdown, direction and the  \ncurrent status of our push towards 1.0. If there are any developers  \nout there who would like to give some of their time to the project,  \nplease feel free to email me at anytime (or drop into #buddypress on  \nfreenode).\nAs always, bugs can be reported at: http://trac.buddypress.org/ \nnewticket (login with your WP.org support forum credentials).\nThanks!\nAndy\n---------\nAndy Peatling | Social Engineer | Automattic\nhttp://andyinlife.com",

Presumably\nsome code somewhere is expecting/assuming UTF-8 encoding.\nHope that helps,\nMike\n-- \nMike Little\nhttp://zed1.com/",

I decided that I wanted\nwww.domainname.com/members/username to show a user profile and list their\nblogs and www.domainname.com/profile to show the current user. First problem\nis that because I am not configured as a virtual host Wordpress MU tries to\ncreate a blog called members or profile, I have managed to solve this by\nchanging a line in wpmu-settings.php from\n$blognames = array( 'page', 'comments', 'blog', 'wp-admin', 'wp-includes',\n'wp-content', 'files', 'feed' );\nTo\n$blognames = array( 'page', 'comments', 'blog', 'wp-admin', 'wp-includes',\n'wp-content', 'files', 'feed', 'members', 'profile' ); \n \nIs there a better way of getting Wordpress MU to allow this to go through?\n \nFor those of you that may want to do the same thing I then modified my\n.htaccess and added the following lines to it:\nRewriteRule ^.*/?members/(.*)/ /index.php?sn_action=member\u0026sn_member=$1 [L]\nRewriteRule ^.*/?profile/$ /index.php?sn_action=profile [L]\n \nI'm far from being a mod rewrite expert, so someone may be able to suggest a\nbetter way of doing this?\n \nI then wrote a plug-in that looks for sn_action and includes a page from the\ncurrent template to display the information e.g.\n function member_redirect() {\n  if (isset($_GET['sn_action'])) {\n        $action = $_GET['sn_action']; \n            switch($action) {\n          case 'member':\n        if (isset($_GET['sn_member'])) {\n          $sn_member = $_GET['sn_member'];\n          if($template = get_query_template('member')) {\n            include($template);\n            exit;\n          }\n        }\n            exit;\n          break;  \n...\u003csnip\u003e\n \nadd_action('template_redirect', 'member_redirect');\n \nAgain I am no expert at this there may be a better way?\n \nAll that remains to be done is to add a member.php etc. to the home\ntemplate. You can then modify the default template to show all author\ninformation for the blog, with links to their profiles, instead of trying to\nfigure out who's profile to show for the current blog.\n \nIt will also allow me to add template changes so that a user can \"follow\" a\nblog, but be a \"friend\" to a user.\n \nAnother problem I see with this method is the member URL is formed using the\nlogin name of the user, I really don't want to make that publically\nviewable, is there a way currently, or going to be a way in the future that\nI can create a required field in XProfile that should be unique across all\nusers, so a user can enter what they want to be used for their URL?\n \nI love where BuddyPress is going, and have enjoyed working on my own theme\nfor it, if any one wants more information on what I'm doing, let me know,\n \nMartin\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/buddypress-dev/attachments/20080619/cf085080/attachment.htm",

    "subject": "[buddypress-dev] My experience upgrading to latest Trunk r337",
    "body": "I took the plunge yesterday and upgraded to the most recent changes in \nBuddypress. I decided to start from scratch as it seemed it would take \nmore time to retro fit everything and make it work as I already had a \nnumber of blogs and users etc... All in all, I had to make a few \nmodifications to my custom functions that interact with buddypress but \nnothing too major and everything works as expected now. In the process I \nnoticed a couple of bugs in the bp_core_get_avatar() function so here's \nmy version of it (changes highlighted in red):\nfunction bp_core_get_avatar( $user, $version = 1, $no_tag = false, $width = null, $height = null ) {\n\tif ( !is_int($version) )\n\t\t$version = (int) $version;\n\tif ( CORE_AVATAR_V2_W == false \u0026\u0026 CORE_AVATAR_V2_H == false )\n\t\t$version = 1;\n\t$home_base_id = get_usermeta( $user, 'home_base' );\n\t$url = get_blog_option($home_base_id, 'siteurl');\n\tif ( !$width )\n\t\t$width = constant('CORE_AVATAR_V' . $version . '_W');\n\tif ( !$height )\n\t\t$height = constant('CORE_AVATAR_V' . $version . '_H');\n\t$str = get_usermeta( $user, \"bp_core_avatar_v$version\" );\n\tif ( strlen($str) ) {\n\t\tif ( $no_tag )\n\t\t\treturn $url . '/' . $str;\n\t\telse\n\t\t\treturn '\u003cimg src=\"' . $url . '/' . $str . '\" alt=\"\" class=\"avatar\" width=\"' . $width . '\" height=\"' . $height . '\" /\u003e';\n\t} else {\n\t\tif ( $no_tag )\n\t\t\treturn CORE_DEFAULT_AVATAR_THUMB;\n\t\telse\n\t\t\treturn '\u003cimg src=\"' . CORE_DEFAULT_AVATAR . '\" alt=\"\" class=\"avatar\" width=\"' . $width . '\" height=\"' . $height . '\" /\u003e';\n\t}\n}\nHowever, I'd like to see this function to be a bit more flexible and \nallow for custom alt and title tags. Also, if $no_tag is true, it would \nbe nice if it returned both the image URL and the profile URL.\nAnyhow, I'm quite pleased with this new version but I'd like to have the \noption to not display the user admin nav on the front end when the user \nis logged in and on the main site blog as, I'm sure, many people would \nwant to do their own 'user thing' on the main site blog. For example, I \nhave a box in the sidebar on my main home theme showing the logged in \nuser and some quick links... Is there an easy hack to just display the \ntop admin bar on the user home base or on the profile theme only? I \nguess I could move the add_action( 'wp_footer', 'bp_core_admin_bar' ); \nto the buddypress theme? I realise that this is still very much WIP and \nI'm sure these things will be refined...\nCheers for the good work on this, much appreciated!\nKind regards,\nRobert",

Can it be added if a WPMu site is in \"full swing\" \nor is that a risk at this stage?\nAhh, the life on the razor's edge, eh :).\nThanks for the good work though.

However, since Buddypress\ndoesn?t appear to alter existing Wordpress tables I don?t see a reason for\nit to cause any problems. Nor have any adverse affects if the plugins are\nremoved from the MU-Plugins folder.\nI agree with you, Buddypress is amazing project. Andy (and contributors)\nhave done an incredible job with the development and implementation. I have\ngone to bed many nights with a huge smile after seeing just a simple\naddition was made to Buddypress.\nOne note. The ?home? theme should be applied to the Admin users theme. If it\nisn?t and the ?default? theme is used it will display 404 errors when logged\non as ?Admin?. Any other user will work fine. The good news, when a  user\ncreates an account the ?Default? theme is applied. From my understanding the\nhome theme is just a place holder, with a bit of functionality. (blog,\nregister, login, etc.)\n- Brian\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/buddypress-dev/attachments/20080820/9e767d84/attachment.htm",

    "body": "Something I've been looking into over the last few weeks is something  \nI like to call \"JIT inclusions\" or \"Just In Time\" inclusions. I  \nthought it would be a nice topic to re-open up this mailing list with.\nHere's the challenge BuddyPress faces with the way it works right now.\nEach component needs to set up its own environment. It needs its own  \ntemplate tags, filters, DB access classes and so on. As it stands in  \nBuddyPress, each component loads these in as soon as the component is  \ninitialized. When you multiply this by 8 components, you're loading a  \nlot of code into memory on each page load. This means BuddyPress has a  \nfairly large memory footprint, even if you're doing nothing.\nWhat I think needs to happen is this JIT idea, where a file that  \ncontains code that is needed for a function is only included right  \nbefore it is *actually* needed.\nSome of this could be handled by adding require_once() calls within  \nfunctions, so they are only loaded when that function is called. This  \nwon't make a huge difference overall though, and I don't think  \nlittering the code with require_once() calls is a solid approach.\nWhat really needs to happen is some sort of system where when a  \nfunction is called, a check is done to see if this function exists, if  \nnot, the correct file is included so the function can be loaded.\nThink about this scenario:\nTemplate tags for components can be used anywhere, on any page, under  \nany slug. How do we make those template tags available for use without  \nloading all component template tag files on every page?\nWith the system I envision, when you call the bp_has_site_members()  \nloop, an action would fire that would automatically include the 'bp- \ncore/bp-core-templatetags.php' file that this template loop resides  \nin. That way we are only including the files we need just in time for  \nthe functions within them to run.\nIs any of this possible? Possibly, but possibly not. The system would  \nhave to maintain a list of all functions, and in which files they  \nreside in. This in itself may be too inefficient. It would also have  \nto handle some sort of function_exists() call, so that PHP doesn't  \ntrigger a fatal error before we even have a chance to fetch the  \ncorrect file.\nI know that some PHP frameworks use naming conventions to handle at  \nleast some of this. In PHP5 there is also autoload for classes (http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php \n) which would be great for DB access, but we need to stick to  \nsupporting PHP4 for now. Perhaps there is a way we can mimic this  \nfunctionality though?\nMy question is, does anyone have any experience, or smart ideas  \nsurrounding this?\nAndy\n---------\nAndy Peatling | Social Engineer | Automattic\nhttp://apeatling.wordpress.com",

Once all of  \nthe template files are added (still need templates for activity,  \nstatus updates and the photo gallery) you can even change any of the  \nHTML, as long as you keep the ID's consistent.\n\u003e I'm not sure if the approach with the admin bar being in the bp-core  \n\u003e is conducive to separating presentation from code.

Personally I think the  \nbar should be there by default (with a site admin option to switch it  \noff). The idea is that it will be there no matter what blog theme or  \npage you are viewing. It keeps a consistent way to get back to  \nBuddyPress features. If you remove the bar, there is no way of quickly  \ngetting back to your own profile or any other BuddyPress screen.\n\u003e I assume that this is due to the early stage in BuddyPress  \n\u003e development and that it will be dealt with at some point :).\nIt's more that it's further down the list. My priority at the moment  \nis to get the first version of all the components out there (possibly  \napart from the gallery stuff). Then go back through sharpen up all  \nthese parts.\n\u003e My concerns are that I'm trying to find a way to manage frequent  \n\u003e Buddypres updates in the context of my project where I do need to  \n\u003e customise at least the theme's CSS styles and logos. It would be  \n\u003e great if there was a provision made soon to enable custom buddypress  \n\u003e themes to be installed.\nHonestly, if you create a custom CSS file, @import() that at the top  \nof the style.css and make your modifications, you will have no  \nproblems. You can just drop your customizations back in every time you  \nupdate the theme.\nCheers\nAndy\n---------\nAndy Peatling | Social Engineer | Automattic\nhttp://apeatling.wordpress.com",

What those are I'm not sure, but they could include\ncomparing data between user and friend.\nI've clarified the list below:\n\u003e  - Includes the current status of each friend when it changes\nAbsolutely, I would say this is the most important thing\n\u003e  - Includes a link to the latest post from each friend when a post is made\nYep, very important\n\u003e  - Show what topics your friends have been posting on (do you mean tags or\n\u003e categories?)\nSorry, I should have made this clear. I meant what forum topics (for\nexample in bbPress) they were writing in\n\u003e  - Includes links to recently-added photos from friends when these photos\n\u003e are added to a gallery\nYes, definitely. Being able to show a thumbnail would be great as well.\n\u003e  - Compare favourites etc. with friends (not sure how this would work)\nThis would be a VERY clever system to do this. I think for the initial\nversion of BuddyPress this just isn't going to happen.\n\u003e - Include links to bookmarks of friends when these are added.\nYes, great idea. That is a sort of del.icio.us type feature, I suppose.\n\u003e - Include links to a comment of a friend when they do comment.\nIf you mean when a friend comments on someone else's blog then that's\nvery, very tricky. There might be a way to do it but my mind currently\ncan't figure it out.\n\u003e Something like that. If its not like a news feed and it just shows the\n\u003e latest post/ picture by friends regardless of how long ago it was made, it\n\u003e looses some of its magic don't you think?\nYes, I agree. Maybe showing updates from the last few days would be\nenough. Perhaps the user could even set how far back they want to see\nby default, to handle the different number of times different users\nmight log in per week. Of course archives would be good as well, so\npeople can catch up after being offline for a while, for example.\nThanks for these good ideas. Wessel, are you a developer?

I really want to hear  \n\u003e people's thoughts and ideas on how we can make BuddyPress as  \n\u003e distributed and open as possible.\nIn my ideal world I'd be able to manage all of my profile/social data  \nin WordPress with fine grained control over who can do what with the  \ndata.  Similar to the way the Flickr application authorization works,  \nit would be nice to have LinkedIn (just one example) contact my blog  \nasking for data.  I can then approve it and specifically list what  \ndata it can read and write.  Instead of polling for new data,  \nLinkedIn would be able to push updates (that I've authorized) back to  \nmy blog.\nAnd there's no reason why this would need to be a one way thing.  If  \nI change something in my profile that I've granted LinkedIn read  \naccess to, no reason why I shouldn't just push that data out to  \nLinkedIn.\nThis doesn't have to be limited to traditional profile data either.   \nThe social graph data could also be passed back and forth.  If  \nsomeone who only uses LinkedIn makes a contact request in LinkedIn  \nand I approve it, that \"relationship\" could be pushed back to my blog  \n(assuming I allowed LinkedIn to do that).\nI used LinkedIn as an example because many people are familiar with  \nit, but in this scenario WordPress could not only be a profile/social  \ndata server, but a client as well.  My WordPress blog could contact  \nBob asking for access.  Bob can then approve my blog and specify  \nwhich data I can read or write and I can do the same on my blog.   \nThis way when I change my email address, my blog goes out and tells  \nBob's blog about this change and vice versa (assuming both blogs had  \nthe correct permissions to do so).  A decentralized profile/social  \ndata network.\nFine grained access settings is a major feature here.  I might want  \nto share my mobile phone number with Bob, but not LinkedIn.\n--\nJoseph Scott\njoseph@randomnetworks.com\nhttp://joseph.randomnetworks.com/",

    "body": "Hi all,\nI've just joined this list as I am working on a WPMU project to build a \nblog community site with requirements that fit exactly with the features \nBuddyPress provides, such as extended profiles, private messaging, \nfriends and groups.\nI want to use WPMU 2.6+ for this project but realised that the current \nrelease of BuddyPress does not work correctly with the Mu release.\nSo, I'm just wondering how far away is the compatibility update for \nBuddyPress and WPMu 2.6? Does the current BuddyPress SVN version perhaps \nwork already with Mu2.6?\nThanks in advance and sorry if this has been answered somewhere, I \ncouldn't find any conclusive info about this.\nOh, it would be really nice to say on the BuddyPress Trac download page \nwhat version of WPMu is supported :).\nKind regards,\nRobert",

The function bp_core_time_since, which makes the\nrepresentation of the time elapsed, simply adds a 's' if the number not one.\nIn this case it would be better to use __ngettext.\nThe next problem is, that buddypress use for example for the localization of\n\"registered 3 hours, 9 minutes ago\" 2 strings!

The best way to learn is to get in there and see what  \nis going on.\nGood luck!\nAndy",

        "body": "I don't have the link handy, but if you search the wpmu forums, there\nare some older threads about this kind of stuff.  The primary 2\nmethods either require using a script that automatically posts data to\nthe sign-up form (though posts about this are often deleted or derided\nas being only needed by spam bloggers), or hacking the wpmu core just\na little bit to allow the wpmu_create_blog() function to work more\nthan once in a script (I believe Vinn or Vim is a user who has posted\nsome patch files in the wpmu trac).\nI have a very hacked together shell script along with a few changes to\nthe wpmu core that allows me to automatically import users in my\nprimary system into wpmu/bp install, however the code is very hacky\nand not really production ready.  In order to add BP-specific user\ndata, I basically copied some code that appears in the sign-up form to\ncreate the BP Profile fields.  I also have to do some funky stuff with\n$_SERVER to make the wordpress files believe it's being run from a web\npage and not a shell script.  And also make sure I'm very careful with\nany local variable names since they are all in the global scope.  As I\nsaid, really, really hacky.\nThe basic answer is that it's not simple (and given the tenor of\nresponders to questions like these in the wpmu community, never will\nbe simple) but it can be done.  I don't have access to my code atm,\nbut I could possibly post some examples of what I've done some time\nnext week if there is interest.\n- dave\nOn Fri, Aug 29, 2008 at 10:58 PM, Jed Barish \u003cjed@deafnation.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e Yes, I would like to know how to do that.

Besides, when the same \nuser subsequently creates a blog, then the default wording is fine as \nthey are creating a blog.\nCheers,\nRobert",

Once you have it\nbacked up remove the /home/ directory from /wp-content/themes/\n[it's not clear from this README why you need to backup but then\nremove the vanilla home theme. What's more important is setting the\ndefault theme to be 'BuddyPress Home Theme' or otherwise a user's blog\nis a blank page. The Admin needs to activate the BuddyPress Home Theme\nin Site Admin/Themes, so a user can see the theme they are using. I'm\nnot 100% sure how the site admin selects the default blog theme for\nnew users, but it didn't default to the BuddyPress Home Theme for me\non two installs.]\nCheers\nJoss",
