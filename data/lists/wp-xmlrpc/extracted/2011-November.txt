Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Changing the folder name when using wp.uploadFile API
Message-ID: <CAJvdmtHuaO+JUJfRasgt0iZ3HLBnKAj1h=Rp4PVGnvu=sRbowg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

It seems the wp.uploadFile API will store the actual file based on the
current date of the API being called. But as I am mass uploading
files, I want to separate the files into different folders, it is
possible?

Thanks.

Not without a plugin on the WordPress side too. I believe my plugin
"Add From Server" does that for files it imports (I'd really have to
check to see if that functionality even works still), it doesn't help
you with XML RPC though.
