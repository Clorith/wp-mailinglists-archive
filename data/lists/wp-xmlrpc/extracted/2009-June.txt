Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] WordPress 2.8 released, XML-RPC and AtomPub changes
Message-ID: <D3D75701-59A7-4F62-99F3-EC835B5DF9DC@josephscott.org>


With WordPress 2.8 now released here are the XML-RPC and AtomPub  
changes since 2.7.1:

http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/06/wordpress-2-8-xml-rpc-and-atompub-changes/


XML-RPC
	? Fixed wp.getUsersBlogs and blogger.getUsersBlogs to return the  
correct value for the ?xmlrpc? field when WordPress is installed in  
separate directory ( ticket #9516 )
	? Authentication is filterable now, allowing for alternative  
authentication methods like OAuth ( ticket#8941 and #8938 )
	? Provide sticky status of posts via ?sticky? field in  
metaWeblog.newPost / metaWeblog.editPost / metaWeblog.getPost ( ticket  
#8777 )
	? Don?t duplicate post enclosures ( ticket #7773 )
AtomPub
	? Always use filterable authentication, allowing for alternative  
authentication methods like OAuth ( ticket#9320 and #8938 )
	? Update image captions (summary) correctly ( ticket #9148 )
	? Hooks for extending AtomPub ( ticket #8827 )
	? Fix file upload updates and image processing when uploading an  
image ( ticket #9233 )
	? Provide the correct edit URL for images ( ticket #9147 )

A big thank you to everyone who submitted tickets and patches. With  
2.8 out the door now is the time to bring up new features for  
WordPress 2.9. If you?ve got a patch for a new feature, even better!  
Go submit a ticket at http://core.trac.wordpress.org/.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] metaWeblog.getPost date_created_gmt field for draft
	posts
Message-ID: <42A075D8-BF90-49E2-9BA5-4FD1419C5F14@josephscott.org>


It was reported that the date_created_gmt field for draft posts  
contained screwy data from metaWeblog.getPost.  I don't recall if this  
had been brought up before, but either way it was something that  
needed to get resolved.

Here's the ticket with the details: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10244

I've already deployed this fix for WordPress.com blogs, and Ryan has  
committed it to the WPORG -trunk and the 2.8 branch so it will be part  
of the upcoming 2.8.1 release.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Any support for minipost or similar
Message-ID: <ca18f54e0906260440q4f52f857jb063224a077c2f5f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

After reading about miniposts
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/miniposts/) I got curious about
this feature via XMLRPC.
Checking newPost() I could not see this possibility when publishing new content.
So, I would like to know if you have any plan to add such feature (or
something similar) in the XMLRPC API. It seems interesting.

Since this done via a plugin it's not likely that we'll add XML-RPC  
methods to the core of WP to support it.  It would be easy for the  
plugin author to add XML-RPC methods though to provide access to these  
miniposts: http://josephscott.org/archives/2008/11/adding-xml-rpc-methods-to-wordpress/
