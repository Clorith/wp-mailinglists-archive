Why all the getter methods (mw_getposts, mw_getrecent comments, wp_getpage
etc..)   need authentication??
If i want to an client for reading blogs in an offline mode how can get the
posts from selected blogs??

You can use the RSS feed.

As Danilo says you can use the RSS (or Atom) Feeds to get the public info.

The XML-RPC api needs a authenticated user because it allows access to unpublished or private content too.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Best practise for validating a site connection
Message-ID: <DA0154F6-FD4B-4697-BA01-6A59441D91A0@ftwr.co.uk>

Hi All,

I wonder what you all think is the best way to validate that the url/username/password combo a user has entered in your app is good enough to continue with?

It seems different apps have different ideas.

Some seem to create drafts, some list users blogs, some publish posts!

I wonder if an extra API would be beneficial here - or an extended better version of blogger.getUsersBlogs which gave you info about the capabilities of the user with respect to a site?

Cheers

Not saying this is the best practice, but to complete your menu of differing behaviors: in MarsEdit a successful "getRecentPosts" is pretty much the test for whether a configuration was made correctly or not.

(I don't use getUsersBlogs because the setup sequence in MarsEdit is centered around providing the home page URL to a single blog).

If you decide to do some kind of "capabilities" method, may I suggest you follow the lead of the "API is disabled" error message, and include URLs in the response to the page where a particular capability can be modified. I am thinking something like (in pseudo-XML):

<capabilities>
	<capability name="xmlrpcAccess" enabled="false" settingURL="http://myblog/admin/settings.php">
	<capability name="editPosts" enabled="true" settingURL="etc?">
</capabilities>

Though, come to think of it, maybe this should all be shoe-horned into the wlwmanifest file?

Daniel
