Message-ID: <1E78EA84-EB5E-4E0C-8691-E166222493A4@randomnetworks.com>


We are coming up on another release and I'd like to get more of the  
XML-RPC issues sorted out and resolved.  Starting with our old  
friend, the time zone.

I've prepared a patch that reverts the dateCreated field back to the  
way it was before (blog time) and adds a new field,  
date_created_gmt.  This new field has no time zone data in it, but by  
definition is always GMT.

This patch is against -trunck, instructions on getting that are at  
http://wordpress.org/download/svn/

The following methods are impacted by this:

wp.getPage
wp.getPageList
metaWeblog.getPost
metaWeblog.getRecentPosts
mt.getRecentPostTitles

With my test blog at -6 time zone offset all of the above methods  
return date data as expected (dateCreated is blog time,  
date_created_gmt is GMT).

I'd appreciate if everyone would test this patch against their own  
XML-RPC clients and confirm that this works as expected.

The patch is attached to this trac ticket:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4624

it is the gmt-xmlrpc.php.diff patch.

Thank you.

Turns out that patch got committed to -trunk not long after sending  
this out :-)

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5888

Sync up to -trunk and you'll be able to test this.

Message-ID: <2E847381-D960-4688-8276-BDD54335C3CE@randomnetworks.com>


Allan Odgaard had mentioned to me a problem with mt_allow_pings being  
set properly in metaWeblog.newPost using the value of open, like this:

>     <member>
>         <name>mt_allow_pings</name>
>         <value><string>open</string></value>
>     </member>

For the longest time I was unable to see why this was happening.   
Today I finally found it, there was a typo that caused it to be  
missed.  I've got a patch for this at:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4770

I'll see if I can get this into -trunk as well so that it makes into  
the 2.3.

Nuts, just looked and found another typo for this in  
metaWeblog.editPost, same issue.  I've update the patch above with a  
fix for that as well.  Beyond that editPost also had some duplicated  
code that was processing mt_allow_pings a second time.

I've already updated and deployed the code at wordpress.com with  
these fixes.

A big thank you Allan for pointing this out and keeping on me to get  
it fixed.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] WP doesn't identify xml document text encoding
Message-ID: <7FDA9586-58EE-4D01-92D0-4AAE0FBC2969@red-sweater.com>


I just reported an issue against WP's xml documents:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4794

The issue is that a non-UTF8 blog will vend xml documents with no  
implied encoding, but which contain for instance ISO-8859-1 encoded  
characters. This leaves client XML parsers in a tough situation,  
because some common accented characters are legal in ISO-8859-1 but  
are outside the legal range for UTF-8.

I bring this up on the mailing lost both to help Joseph get more  
opinions about whether it's a good idea to advertise the encoding on  
the XML document, and to bring the attention to other client  
developers, in case their code would be affected by the issue.

The symptom "in the wild" is that parsing XML-RPC responses for some  
blogs will fail if your parser assumes the content is UTF8 and comes  
upon one of these accented characters.

I don?t know which case conventions exist, but isn?t it be better to  
name it dateCreatedGMT?

This also ensures the fields are shown after each other when sorted  
alphabetically and just hints a stronger connection between the two.

I went back and forth a bit on that at first.  After looking at all  
other fields being returned by metaWeblog.getPost by WordPress  
currently I found that dateCreated and permaLink were the only two  
fields that used camel case.  All other fields were either a single  
word or used underscores.  This seemed to be especially true of  
fields not part of the original spec, like mt_* and wp_*.  Based on  
that it went with the underscore.

Sorting should still work, in metaWeblog.newPost they are the only  
two field names that start with date.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] XMLRPC link management into core
Message-ID: <643308.73681.qm@web27512.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi fellows, I'm new here, Stefan Holmberg - from Sweden. 
   
  Just got into WP and must say I'm so impressed I have more or less given up on my selfcoded commercial CMS script (written in asp.net, I am from the MS side of the world...). While the WP admin gui is sometimes not too intuitive the frontend and programmability (is there such a word in english...) features are amazing.   
   
  I have just published my very first plugin wpLinkMentor http://php.aspcode.net/category/wplinkmentor/ - which extends the XML-RPC interface with some link(blogroll) management functions. I created it simply because I needed it - and published it in the spirit of free code. Maybe someone has a use of it. 
   
  Just got an email from Joseph where he/you say 
"We'd like to get wpLinkMentor into the core of WordPress.  I've  
glanced over the code and looks pretty straight forward, although I'd  
like to refine the API some."
   
  That email makes me
a) happy and kind of flatterned :)
b) nervous 
   
  Nervous because while I am a decent coder (C#, C++, VB etc)   
a) I am pretty much a PHP beginner
b) when it comes to XML-RPC - well lets say I got it working by looking into the existing core code and also in code from Brett Terpstras utw-rpc-autotag plugin. Also I have managed to get some C# client code to work against WP:s XMLRPC. But that's where it ends...
   
  Meaning I have indeed gotten some things to work - but have no idea if I have done it "the right way", and seldom cares for doing it the right way either, I have problems to solve and I solve them, end of story. But getting into the core I guess would put the "doing it the right way" pressure on the code.
   
  For example I see some stupid things I have done - for getLinks and deleteLinks I make my own db calls but when last was to implement the updateLink function I discovered there are existing functions in admin-db such as wp_insert_link - meaning I should have used the existing core functions  for getLinks/deleteLinks as well. As I said, I am a WP newbie...
   
  The plugin code is here if you'd care to take a look
  http://php.aspcode.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/wplinkmentor.zip
   
  So to end it up - I don't have a clue on how to proceed with this "getting into the core" thing. Is it something you (automattic) do, or would you like me to develop it further? Either way I would sure like to get some input on how you'd like the interface - fucntion params etc - to look like :) 
  
Or/and if there are some obvious stupid mistakes I have done in my coding. 
   
  I will anyhow try to learn XML-RPC better, cause I have a lot more WP stuff I would like to manage remotely, So I have a lot more rpc functions I will create and publish, soon. 
   
  Last - sorry for the long mail, lol :)

Message-ID: <E16A295A0FCDCD4B96A02B0AF85769AD09A2AB@eurmail.eur.adobe.com>

Hello all,

 

I work at an application that can run basic blog actions making calls to
the WordPress' XML-RPC API. 

 

Now I want to be able to retrieve and approve comments directly from my
app, something that the API doesn't endorse. I have already started
writing the methods that can handle this type of operations and I need
to know how to submit them. Is it OK to commit the changes to the
repository?

 

I checked with the timeline of milestone 2.3 and I found out that the
feature freeze occurred on Aug 23. I will be ready to submit
modifications in a couple of days after I finish implementation and
conduct some tests of my own.  If the changes can't make it to 2.3, what
is the time they could get in a public release?

 

Should I go and submit my proposal as a feature by pushing a ticket into
trac?

 

Best regards,

Bogdan Ghervan

Matt asked me to get this into core WordPress, so in it goes :-)

I want to go ahead an jump into a specific API for core.  For our  
other wp.* methods we've followed the metaWeblog.* format for method  
arguments, so I'd suggest the following methods/arguments:

wp.getLinkCategories
	blog_id (int) required
	username (string) required
	password (string) required
	
wp.getLinks
	blog_id (int) required
	username (string) required
	password (string) required
	category_id (int) required
	limit (int) optional

wp.newLink
	blog_id (int) required
	username (string) required
	password (string) required
	link (struct) required
		name (string) required
		url (string) required
		description (string) required, empty
		visible (int) required
		rel (string) required, empty
		rss (string) required, empty
		notes (string) required, empty
		image (string) required, empty
		categories (array) required
			(int)
			
wp.editLink
	blog_id (int) required
	username (string) required
	password (string) required
	link (struct) required
		id (int) required
		name (string) required
		url (string) required
		description (string) required, empty
		visible (int) required
		rel (string) required, empty
		rss (string) required, empty
		notes (string) required, empty
		image (string) required, empty
		categories (array) required
			(int)
	
wp.deleteLink
	blog_id (int) required
	username (string) required
	password (string) required
	link_id (int) required

I've see reference to mt_tags and mt_keywords on the sixapart site.   
If mt_keywords is being used by others then we'll go that route.

I'll start with patches on that ticket.

mt_tags is a separate field that was added later than mt_keywords.  
But I don't consider myself an expert in this area. It's something  
I've been planning to look into more carefully when I get to finally  
satisfying the request for "real" tags support in MarsEdit.

I'm cross posting this so that folks to the wp-xmlrpc list are aware  
of this.

I'm inclined to agree on removing these at this point.  From the  
looks of things these haven't worked for a long time, if ever.  Even  
if they were made to work it isn't clear what WordPress should do  
with them.

If we want to provide an interface for getting and updating templates  
we could always implement our own wp.getTemplate wp.setTemplate  
methods later.

We could tighten things up on these and other functions that can  
return sensitive data.

When returning post data I'd suggest limiting it to anyone that can  
edit the post (the post author and anyone with editor and  
administrator role).  This would make any of the methods that return  
post data do the same sort of checks that mw_editPost does.  Is there  
any reason why a user who can't edit a post should still be able to  
get the post data via XML-RPC?

For wp_getAuthors we could probably just trim it down to three  
fields: user_id, user_login and display_name.  I don't see any  
benefit derived from including the user_email and meta_value fields.   
On the other hand, is there a potential issue with having the ability  
to enumerate all of the usernames for a blog?  Perhaps this method  
should only work for people who can edit posts (contributer, author,  
edit and admin roles)?
