Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Changes in the upcoming 2.7 release
Message-ID: <BF4BDDB1-C663-42AB-9998-2F0701E7955D@randomnetworks.com>


Work on getting WordPress 2.7 ready for release (targeted for 10  
November currently) is bug hunting mode.  Here's the XML-RPC changes  
that are currently in for 2.7 that have new from 2.6.2:

- New methods:
	- wp.getTags
	- wp.getComment
	- wp.getComments
	- wp.deleteComment
	- wp.editComment
	- wp.newComment
	- wp.getCommentStatusList
- Method changes:
	- metaWeblog.getPost now returns a enclosure data (if there is one  
for the post)
	- metaWeblog.getRecentPosts now returns an empty array instead of an  
error if there are no posts


Lots of comment management features, and starting with some tag  
management.  Please test these out (either check out -trunk or use a  
nightly build) and let us know if there are any errors so that we can  
get them fixed in time for the 2.7 release.

Thanks.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Encoded values in tag & category names
Message-ID: <CAF5A03F-ACC2-4EBD-B576-DCD02758AA30@randomnetworks.com>


I've recently been digging into an issue where tag & category names  
are exposed this encoded values.  For instance, if a tag name is  
'black & white' then it gets exposed as 'black &amp; white'.  After  
some investigation it turns out this is a problem that has been in  
WordPress for awhile (it's not new to the upcoming 2.7 release).  I've  
been able to track down where and why it's happening, but to properly  
fix will require a adjusting a number of things.  With the currently  
push to get 2.7 released soon, we've decided to push fixing this  
problem back to after 2.7 gets released.

I've added a ticket to track this issue: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8002

Thanks to Joe Cheng at Microsoft for bringing this up and prodding me  
to look into it :-)
