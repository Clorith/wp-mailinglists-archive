Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Have you seen this before? wp.getOptions()
 is	executing, but returning no values

The error was related to cURL. 

My service accepts user input via a HTML form. Users that provide a blog 
URL of http://mysite.com when the blog's true URL is 
http://www.mysite.com were getting the error.  cURL doesn't resolve 
properly.

I know that cURL has an option for redirection and that was the initial 
fix.  However, because redirection waits for a timeout before trying 
"the next URL", there was a major drag on loadtimes.  Therefore, I am 
doing the URL check programatically.  If wp.getOptions() doesn't throw 
an error and its values are null, that's a signal that something went 
wrong.  At that point, I use PHP to add the "www" to the user's URI and 
re-run wp.getOptions().  It works.

A look at the server shows that the cURL function throws a -1 error so 
that's probably another way to troubleshoot.

Thanks for your help.  Hopefully, this thread will help somebody else.
