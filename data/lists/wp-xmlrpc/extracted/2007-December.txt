Hello,

I'm in the process of writing a new desktop client for WP for Linux,
using python + gtk. I'm trying to figure out a few things (like python,
and gtk, and the wordpress api ;), but here is one question:

I'd really, really like the client to support tags for posting and
editing old posts. What is the status of mt_keywords or mt_tags or
whatever the right one is (haven't figured that one out yet)

I was also glad to see that the draft status of entries will be exposed
from now on (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4982). Is this definitely
shipping with 2.4?

Cheers,
Carlos

This seems to be working fine.

Hi Joseph - this looks great. Thanks for following up on this.  I  
guess beggars *can* be choosers because it occurs to me that the main  
downside here is that now the API reports more statuses than can be  
set in the API. Before it let you set draft/publish, but didn't report  
anything, now it reports everything but only lets you set draft/publish.

Would it make sense to support the "post_status" field in incoming  
posts, as well?

What I'm mainly concerned by is that now we can get the exact status  
of a post, but how do we represent this in a UI to the user? I can  
only offer the user a choice between Draft and Publish. So when a  
post's status is something else from those two states, how do I know  
which state to indicate in the UI? Should I try to guess between which  
of Draft and Publish the status is closest to?

Ideally I'd be able to populate a popup menu with all the possible  
states for a post, and the user could select from among any of them.

Daniel

When we added tags to WP mt_keywords looked like the most supported  
way to implement them so that is what we went with.

Sounds good. From where I'm standing, the solution works great.

This crossed my mind too and I think the answer is no.  I'll explain  
below.

 From my list on the ticket (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/ 
4982#comment:7) here are the following potential states a post can be  
in and how they can be "set" via the current APIs:

- draft : make publish false and you'll get a draft.

- private : set a password on the post and you'll get a private post  
(wp_password field)

**** - pending : this is the one that I need to research a little bit  
more.  The general idea here is for a user with the "Contributer"  
role (http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#Contributor)  
can "publish" a post and it will get a status of pending, meaning  
pending review.  Someone with the right to really publish posts can  
then review and publish for real.  Right now there is no way for a  
contributor user to add a post though.

- publish : the post has been published.

- future : this is a post that has been "published for a future  
date", so setting a dateCreated in the future and publish to true  
will get you here.


That leaves just the issues for pending posts.  One thing we could do  
is adjust the permissions check on contributor users so that if they  
attempt to publish their posts will always get a post_status of  
pending.  The flip side of this is that I can see that an editor  
would potentially want a list of all pending posts so that they can  
be reviewed.  We don't currently have a way to acquire that, perhaps  
some sort of wp.getPendingPosts method is in order, returning an  
array of post structs for all of the pending posts.

 From the client side of things both future and pending are likely  
new.  I'm not sure that it makes sense for a user to be able to  
select a drop down and select all of these though, unless you  
prompted them for the needed action to make that status possible.  So  
if they selected private then you'd prompt them for a password.  If  
they selected future you'd prompt them for a publish date/time.

Excellent, and welcome to the list.  If there is anything else about  
XML-RPC in WordPress that we can help with don't hesitate to ask.

When changes go into WP XML-RPC I try to send a heads up here so that  
client implementors know what's going on.  You can also see a list of  
the current XML-RPC related tickets on Trac at:

Thanks, Joseph. You've obviously thought through it quite a bit. But  
your analysis raises some more questions for me. It seems that there  
isn't a clear "status" in some situations where there may be overlap.  
For instance, what happens when a post is set draft, but also has a  
password set on it? How do you tell the difference between a private  
draft and a private published?

Good question.  I tried that it out in wp-admin and found that draft  
+ private = draft.  I haven't confirmed this 100%, but I suspect that  
publish/draft will always trump any other status.  So private and  
future will only show for posts that have already been published.   
This still leaves pending as a rather strange beast that is published  
on one level, but not really on another.

Having all of these different statuses in just one field does make  
for some extra work.  So for a status of draft you'd still have to  
look at the password field and see if it is empty in order to  
determine if it is private draft (which might be a misleading term in  
and of itself).

That said I just tried this in wp-admin, take a draft that you've  
saved with a password and select the post status of private, then  
click on save and continue editing.  That will publish your post,  
which probably isn't the most obvious thing to do.  I'll have to  
write a ticket about that, allowing a user to directly set the post  
status leads to some non-obvious events it looks like.

I think there is some confusion of the terminology and the experience
in this discussion. Password doesn't suggest private. It suggests
password protected. Private is a separate property. The mutually
explusive states are draft/private/pending/publish/(future)

Hope that helps,
Lloyd

Hmmm, I must have misunderstood private then.  This makes me wonder  
how private and protected differ then.

Perhaps Daniel was right then and we will need to a way to set post  
status.

I've asked for additional info and it looks like my understanding of  
post_status was way off (open mouth, insert foot).

Being able to set post_status via metaWeblog.newPost will be needed.

To be clear, private posts have nothing to do with password protected  
posts.  A private post will only show up for the author of the post.   
We should be able to set a status of pending review as well, just  
need add some more logic to the permission/capability checks so that  
mw.newPost will accept a post that has publish set to true and the  
status as pending.  In that case a user with the contributor role  
would have their post adjusted so that the publish bit is changed to  
false.  That should allow their post to be saved with the correct  
publish state and post status.

I apologize for the confusion from my earlier comments.

I'm glad that things are getting hashed out. While you're thinking  
about adding an ability to specify post_status, can I also suggest  
that there should be some mechanism for a client to ask for the list  
of possible statuses?  I see something akin to  
"supportedTextFilters" ... since the client can't reasonably display  
the list of statuses without explicitly knowing based on the version  
of WP, or by asking via protocol.

It seems sensible to establish a precedent of requesting a list of  
possible post statuses, and allowing the user to choose from among  
those for any post. The guarantee would then be that any post from WP  
should have a post-status that is from among that list.

I like that idea.  Need a good method name.  wp.getPostStatuses ?   
wp.getPossiblePostStatuses ? wp.getPostStatusList ?

I'll hunt around and see where WordPress is keeping the list of valid  
values for the post_status field.

Message-ID: <623C7D45-5CB3-4028-87D6-C6E7F3BC3666@randomnetworks.com>


The new wp.deleteCategory (ticket #4599) method and support for  
managing custom fields (ticket #5148) have gone into -trunk.  I've  
confirmed that these changes are also available in the nightly builds  
(http://static.wordpress.org/builds/) starting at 20-Dec-2007.

These will be included in the 2.4 release next month so please try  
them out and let me know if you have any questions/comments/bugs/etc.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] additional capability checks
Message-ID: <A08B231C-9797-400D-AB34-A88CEE26285B@randomnetworks.com>


We've added some additional capability checks for the following methods:

wp.getPage
wp.getPages
wp.getPageList
wp.suggestCategories
blogger.getPost
blogger.getRecentPosts
blogger.getUserInfo
metaWeblog.getPost
metaWeblog.getRecentPosts
metaWeblog.getCategories
mt.getRecentPostTitles
mt.getCategoryList
mt.getPostCategories

and to some of the AtomPub requests.


I tested these several times in an effort to make sure that they  
don't impact legit users.  That said if you do find a problem please  
let me know so we can make sure things work as expected in the releases.

These changes are in -trunk, the 2.3 branch and live on  
WordPress.com.  The next release will be 2.3.2 which will be coming  
out soon, these changes are in the 2.3.2-RC1 which you can get at the  
bottom of http://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/ and will be  
in the 2.4 release coming out next month.
