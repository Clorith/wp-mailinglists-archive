Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] XML RPC no response with flash lite?
Message-ID: <B4A70FA2-3700-41CC-9B1B-19A084AF5351@santosohome.com>

hi everyone, this is my first post

i'm trying to develop flash lite client for wordpress blog, i've tried  
using xmlrpcflash by mattism @ sf.net but when put into mobile it  
gives out of memory error.

so i'm trying to re-write at first the metaWeblog.getRecentPosts but  
unsuccessful, hope i can get a solution. i haven't done programming  
for 8 years so i'm in beginner mode.

the xml is created as xml rpc spec but i got no XML response back. any  
idea why?

this is the trace output in flash (username and password replaced):

this is xmlcallstring:  
<methodCall><methodName>metaWeblog.getRecentPosts</ 
methodName><params><param><value><string>1</string></value></ 
param><param><value><string>username</string></value></

I may have overlooked something, but is there anything like wp.editCategory?

Thank you,

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Using date_created_gmt in a Java application??
Message-ID: <561806f00809220840h11ba391elb343ab08864a923e@mail.gmail.com>

I'm writing a Java app using the redstone xmlrpc library and having a
problem with both postCreated and date_created_gmt

Whenever I set the postCreated field, WP interprets/modifies the timezone to
GMT. For the time being, I've kludged the date (adding the difference
between the local TZ and GMT) so that WP gets the post date right.  This is
ugly and I'd rather not do this . . .

It's been suggested that I use the date_created_gmt field, but I've had zero
luck getting this to work.  It seems that WP cannot parse the passed in
java.util.Date as a valid date and subsequently defaults to the current
date.

Any thoughts on whats going on here?  Anyone care to share some working
code?

thanks

tom


Here's a snipet of what I'm doing . . .


HashMap<String,Object> content = new HashMap<String,Object>();

java.util.Date postDate;

Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
c.add(Calendar.Days, 7);

postDate = c.getTime();

// snip . . .
// title, keywords, category, description, etc.  are all populated . . .
//

content.put("title",title);
content.put("mt_keywords",keywords);
content.put("categories", new String[]{category});
content.put("post_status", "publish");
content.put("description", articlebody);
 //content.put("date_created_gmt",  postDate);  // date doesn't get
interpretted correctly and defaults to the current date
content.put("dateCreated", postDate); // date is offset by local TZ - GMT

Object[] params = new Object[]{new String("n/a"), user, pass, content, new
Boolean("true")};
 Object token;
try {
  token = client.invoke("metaWeblog.newPost", params);
} catch (XmlRpcException ex) {
  Logger.getLogger(WPDripFeederView.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null,
ex);
} catch (XmlRpcFault ex) {
  Logger.getLogger(WPDripFeederView.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null,
ex);
}

Hmmm, seems like we managed to miss that one.

Can you post the raw XML when using date_created_gmt?  I'm afraid my  
Java skills are pretty limited, perhaps someone else will have some  
suggestions on that side of things.

Turns out the version of WP that I'm using as a test blog has an older
version of xmlrpc.php
that does not have date_created_gmt (only looks for dateCreated in the
struct).  Hence, using
the date_created_gmt field is yielding exactly the result that I was seeing:
use current date.
(I was referencing a local copy of xmlrpc.php that I must have grabbed from
a more recent
version of WP)

So now I'm back to the dateCreated situation -- dateCreated interprets the
passed in date
as GMT.  Which, as it turns out, is exactly what the spec specifies (
http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec)

<dateTime.iso8601>    date/time    19980717T14:08:55

Note that there is not TZ (or millisecond) component to the dateTime.iso8601
-- So I'm supposing
that my method of offsetting my desired postdate by the diff between the
local TZ and GMT is
the only way to get around this . . .

Also, I started going down the path to dump the XML being sent to the
server, but couldn't find
anything.  Is there a mechanism on WP to log the XML somewhere??  Would be
handy to know
for future debugging.

thanks

The spec doesn't actually specify.

Don't assume a timezone. It should be specified by the server in its documentation what assumptions it makes about timezones.

I believe appending a "Z" to the end of the date/time string will make WP interpret it as GMT-if your library will let you do that.

Yep, that would explain it :-)

Sadly the spec doesn't detail out the TZ issues at all (even worse it  
says each app should figure it out for themselves).  This was why we  
added date_created_gmt to WordPress, to have a field that was always  
(by definition) GMT.
