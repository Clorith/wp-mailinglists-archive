Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] XML-RPC and Roles
Message-ID: <BANLkTikurrtgXV0a2MytFDgxcEghWgXhNg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

We're developing an Android app for a wordpress.org blog. Since RSS only
lists the most recent posts and we wanted to get access to the older ones we
decided to use XML-RPC. Unfortunately I just found that subscriber role has
no access to the XML-RPC features.

We need a read-only account to access XML-RPC and we don't want to put admin
password in the app. How should we proceed? Any suggestion?

I found this myself:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/xmlrpc-038-getrecentposts-038-user-role

No help though.

Best,

My recommendation would be to use a plugin like Role Scoper (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/role-scoper/) to create a custom XML-RPC
user role.  You can then explicitly grant users the ability to read content
but not create content.

Dear Eric,

Thanks for the tip. I tried the Role Scoper. It seems the user needs to have
"edit_published_posts" and "edit_others_posts" permissions to get access to
XML-RPC responses. True? I tried it on the original Wordpress Android app. I
couldn't fetch the posts with Author role since it has no
"edit_others_posts" permission. If it's true, what do you suggest then?

Best,

XML-RPC is not for what you want to do.

I would build a new page that outputs however many posts you want using either date ranges, paging, or some other factor to limit the results.

Instead of modifying the user capabilities, why don't you add a new
xmlrpc method that does a similar thing of get_recent_posts? You can
easily add new xmlrpc methods.

Following you can find the code from the original Android app. The method
only tries "getRecentPosts" and not any more. That fails without both
"edit_published_posts" and "edit_others_posts" accesses.  result.length ==
0.

Do you mean anything different?

P.S. Why I'm insisting on using xml-rpc is that the app is already done! We
just don't want to use a user account with edit access in our source codes.
We didn't know about the permissions from the beginning and we were testing
with admin account. #FAIL

The purpose of XML-RPC is to be able to add and edit posts.  XML-RPC needs authentication because it has the ability to read posts which are not public.

A custom RSS feed is your best bet at this point.

Message-ID: <93EDF43C-CB36-4CC5-93F4-5E0DD48A74C1@red-sweater.com>


Hi everybody. A change that went in to 3.1.3 is having an effect on the API and how some of my customers use it to edit custom field values for e.g. the All In One SEO pack.

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/17994

This change altered the behavior of WordPress so that custom fields with a leading _ underscore cannot be edited by clients of the API. It seems that AIO SEO uses (or used? don't know if they've updated the plugin) custom field names like "_aioseop_title" and "_aioseop_keywords". Presumably this is because they don't want to have the custom fields show up in the standard custom field editing UI in WordPress.

The net effect is some customers can no longer edit the pertinent custom field values for 3rd party plugins they have installed. 

Does anybody know if the WordPress team stance on this is that 3rd party plugins should only use "non-protected" naming conventions for their custom field keys?

If it is expected to be acceptable for 3rd party developers to continue using these "protected" custom field values, then I think the team should consider revising the changes in r17994 so that protected custom fields are still editable via the API.

This doesn't seem like expected behavior. Affecting XML-RPC was not one of
our goals.

plugins should only use "non-protected" naming conventions for their custom
field keys?

They should use underscores. Plugins do that not just to keep it out of the
custom fields UI, but to indicate to WP that they will be handling the
saving of that key.

I brought it up with one of the other core developers. I'll post here
probably tomorrow with an update.

Thanks! Would it be useful for me to log a bug on this, or just as well to wait and let it percolate through private channels?
