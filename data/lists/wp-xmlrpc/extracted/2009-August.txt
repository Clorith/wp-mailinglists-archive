Is there no C# XML-RPC library?  That would probably be easier than  
having to build of the raw XML yourself.

Message-ID: <49DBD86C-7F2C-4D5E-8217-74042DFA3C14@josephscott.org>


Seeing this ticket from Joe Cheng (from the Windows Live Writer team)  
- http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10599 - (I think I already  
know what the issue is there) reminded me to put a call out for  
tickets, patches and outstanding issues that you'd like to see get  
attention for the upcoming 2.9 release of WordPress.  We are far  
enough out from the release right now to get changes in and have time  
to test them.

If you have an AtomPub or XML-RPC issue that doesn't have a ticket yet  
please submit it at http://core.trac.wordpress.org/

You can see the current tickets that are marked for the XML-RPC  
component -

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=XML-RPC&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component

and AtomPub component tickets -

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=AtomPub&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone

Looking for a way to help?  Find a ticket that interests you and see  
if it has a patch.  If it does try it out and make sure it solves the  
problem and doesn't cause any new ones.  If it clears both of those  
hurdles leave a comment on the ticket indicating that, then those with  
commit privs will have less work to do.  If there's no patch then  
start work on one.

Questions?  This email list is a good place for XML-RPC and AtomPub  
discussions.  There's also the #wordpress-dev IRC channel on  
freenode.  I'm often logged in there, along with other developers, and  
am happy to help.  I know DCJ (the MarsEdit author) is often lurking  
in that channel as well.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] APP and XMLRPC Ticket questions
Message-ID: <03026FF0-8085-43A1-804E-A920607ECC03@ftwr.co.uk>

Hi All,

A couple of ticket related questions that I thought I would ask the  
experts on.

Firstly: <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7968>

This is about changing the response of WP when APP disabled from the  
current plain text response to a wp_die formatted one.

This sounds like a good idea - I just want to make sure that going  
from plain txt to html isn't going to cause any client issues.

Secondly: <http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10658>

This is about improving the feedback on GET requests to xmlrpc.php  
endpoint.

I like the basic idea of the ticket but I think we can go one better  
and, using wp_die again, provide feedback on enablement status and a  
like to documentation on the codex about XMLRPC.

Feedback welcome

Hi Peter -

MarsEdit has no dependency on the text-based failure messages.

Would wp_die mean an HTML formatted failure?   I think it would be  
even better if the APP and XMLRPC endpoints could fail with XML  
formatted failures. This would automatically allow for error  
presentation in MarsEdit, and I suspect would do the same for other  
clients.

I looked at the current situation versus using wp_die.  The wp_die  
function is really targeted at providing HTML pages to users, so I  
don't think that it's a good fit when talking to other software. And I  
think the other things WP does to work around browser bugs doesn't  
help.  Here is what we current send back (tested with curl -v):

I think the patched version is extra work with no reward.

Agreed, in this case we are returning content to a browser for the end  
user, so it should be HTML.  One more additional step would be return  
a more useful message for GET requests even when XML-RPC is enabled.

Yeah the HTML version for APP does have a large overhead.

I like Daniels suggestion of an XML response.

Reading the APP spec is doesn't seem like there is any standard for  
this - maybe this is something we can pioneer for APP failure responses?

Yeah a better get when enabled as well was what I was trying to imply.

Something along the lines of a short message about what the endpoint  
is for (links to the codex?) and then a statement about if it is/isn't  
enabled.

Some of you might remember the discussion previously about reducing  
the memory usage for large XML-RPC requests.  Demitrious Kelly has  
done some great work on this for WordPress.com.

	http://blog.apokalyptik.com/2009/08/28/some-wordpress-xmlrpc-lov

I've put together a patch for WordPress.org -trunk:

	Ticket - http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10698

This should really help out for large XML-RPC requests with base64  
encoded data.

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.0908291837130.23088@icf1.sverfvgrf.pbz>


Help, I'm trying to create a new post with custom fields using the following 
perl script, but there seems to be an issue with the custom fields, only the 
second one "width" ever seems to get posted. Can't make multiple fields go up. 
When I add another field, I get the "Odd number of elements in anonymous hash" 
error. This has got to be something simple - would someone kindly sanity check 
my syntax? Thanks.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use RPC::XML::Client;
use Data::Dumper;

my $cli=RPC::XML::Client->new('http://www.sitename.com/wp/xmlrpc.php');

my $appkey="perl"; # doesn't matter
my $blogid=1; # doesn't matter (except blogfarm)

my $username="Jim";
my $passwd='_____';

my $text=<<'END';

This is the post content...

You can also include html tags...

See you!
END

my $publish=0; # set to 1 to publish, 0 to put post in drafts

my $resp=$cli->send_request('metaWeblog.newPost',
   $blogid,
   $username,

       { "key" => "height", "value" => 500 },
       { "key" => "width", "value" => 750 }
     },
   },
   $publish);

exit 0;

You're passing the list of custom fields as a hashref, but I think that 
it needs to be an arrayref, instead. Try changing from this:

     'custom_fields' => {
       { "key" => "height", "value" => 500 },
       { "key" => "width", "value" => 750 }
     },

To this:

     'custom_fields' => [
       { "key" => "height", "value" => 500 },
       { "key" => "width", "value" => 750 }
     ],
