Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] WordPress 3.0.3
Message-ID: <AANLkTinoe+Hg_-Te5BC6cwAMoBZ7G-u7ze3XSgRpOLHu@mail.gmail.com>

WordPress 3.0.3 has been released. This is a security release for all
previous WordPress versions.

This release fixes issues in XML-RPC where which under certain circumstances
allowed Author- and Contributor-level users to improperly edit, publish, or
delete posts. This release only affects sites which have XML-RPC enabled.

Those wishing to continue to test the 3.1 Beta, please note that the
currently nightly build contains the fixes that were included in 3.0.3.

I'd advise you to update your plugin compatibility as appropriate. Plugins
should be unaffected by this release.

Thanks,

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Publicize features on WordPress.com accessible via API?
Message-ID: <B750538A-F497-439A-8F39-B38FA76444F1@red-sweater.com>


I'm wondering if anybody knows whether the "Publicize" features e.g. for cross-posting to Twitter, are accessible at all via the API on WP.com?

As far as I know custom fields are not user-accessible on WP.com, but I wonder if there's any chance this feature is implemented quietly via custom fields?

I'm not sure what you expect to be available via custom fields here?

Publicize just works as a post publish action if the user has enabled it so XMLRPC posts get Publicized too.

Thanks for your response, Peter.

I should have done more homework. The customer described the behavior in a way that made me assume they could e.g. customize the content of a publicize tweet on a per-post basis. Maybe there is just a misunderstanding. I'll check back with him!
