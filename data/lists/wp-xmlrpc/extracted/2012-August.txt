Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] XML-RPC method for searching WP blog posts?
Message-ID: <502E987E.1060606@tiscali.co.uk>

This is my first post to the wp-xmlrpc mailing list.

I have a pretty simple question: is there an XML-RPC method supported by 
WordPress which allows you to search for blog posts?

All of the APIs listed in the WordPress Codex only seem to have a 
"getPost" method which requires you to know the ID of the post.

I'd prefer to search for posts by text in the title or content.

Any input would be much appreciated.


Robert

Hey Robert,

There isn't a method for searching. There is btw a wp.getPosts for getting blog posts but it doesn't have a search parameter.
I created a ticket for it: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21623 but to get into WordPress it will take at least till the end of this year when 3.5 will be released.

Only thing you can do now is create your own method.

Marko -

Thanks for that.

I decided to take another approach in the end which was to install the 
JSON API plugin and then run searches via regular GET requests to WordPress.
