Posted details on what has changed in XML-RPC and AtomPub in 2.9:

With work on 3.0 starting now is the time to get
changes/fixes/updates/improvements/new features submitted.  If you
already have a ticket and/or patch and it just needs some review and
attention lets do that now.  It's much easier make changes early on in
the dev cycle, and that will be especially true with 3.0 and the WPMU
merge.
