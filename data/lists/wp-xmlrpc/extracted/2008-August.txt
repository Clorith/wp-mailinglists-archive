 http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/7446/7446.9.diff

The following methods are implemented:

wp.getComment(blog_id, username, password, comment_id)

wp.getComments(blog_id, username, password, {status, post_id, number, offset}

wp.deleteComment(blog_id, username, password, comment_id)

wp.editComment(blog_id, username, password, comment_id, {status,
date_created_gmt, content, author, author_url, author_email, })

wp.newComment(blog_id, username, password, post, {content, author,
author_email, author_url})
// author info is optional if authorization is successful.
Unregistered commenting is allowed if a plugin sets the
xmlrpc_allow_anonymous_comments filter to true.  Default is to not
allow unregistered comments.  User must auth.

Hi,

The changes you've made look excellent, though I'm concerned that anonymous commenting is being neglected here. Although a lot of XMLRPC use is blog authors manipulating their blogs remotely, use of the interface by 3rd parties for services such as commenting and pingbacks is something thats only going to get more popular. I believe anonymous commenting via XMLRPC should be enabled by default, just as commenting via the form is.

In terms of security, its fair to say that allowing commenting via XMLRPC is no more risky than allowing commenting via the standard form POST action. Also, as with WordPress 2.6, XMLRPC is disabled by default, so requiring a plugin to enable anonymous commenting is only adding another hurdle for blog owners to cross if they want to enable this feature. I appreciate opening another possible entry point for spam is not ideal, but more would be lost by cutting these blogs off from the potential of receiving comments from external sources.

Kind regards,

This is only true for certain conditions.  There are a number of  
plugins that add items to the comment form/page that make it harder  
for spammers to get through.  Blogs that use those plugins this would  
be a step backwards, which we are trying to avoid.

I've got back and forth on this, but as someone who gets 5 tons of  
spam on his personal blog, we've got to come up with way to help  
distributed comments, that doesn't involve open another spam flood gate.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Non-Moderator Comments
Message-ID: <E8E12625-41A7-4DCF-AB94-A4E6B55C53F2@givethepeople.com>

Following the threads I understand the desire to prevent spam from  
coming through the xmlrpc pipe, but want to raise the question of non- 
moderator users being able to post comments through xmlrpc.  Currently  
only admins or editors can post through the xmlrpc even with valid  
login credentials.  Assuming the WP site is set up so that users have  
to be logged in to comment, subscribers, contributors and authors  
should also be able to post comments.  I did a test commenting out the  
code which checks for moderator status, which allows for subscribers  
to post.  The nice thing is that for first time subscribers, the  
comments still must be approved in this manner.  As such, unless I'm  
missing something, I don't think doing this would leave a means for  
spam to exploit, unless the concern is having to moderate attempts.   
Otherwise none of the spam comments could make it live just by using  
the xmlrpc without being moderated first.

Thoughts?

When I try publish a post using xmlrpc, the resulting published post strips off the "embed" or "iframe" tag contents. 

Is there any way around this? 

Thanks in advance for any help.

Thanks

Hi Joseph - maybe somebody else can elaborate further, but I believe  
the source of this issue is a security feature applied by the file wp- 
includes/kses.php.

Some of my customers have had good luck editing that file to be more  
liberal with the types of attributes it allows for a given tag.

Thanks for the reply. I was able to make this work by adding a plugin that 
convert my tag to the embed statement.  As you pointed out, it seems this is 
a security feature.

Thanks
Joseph

(Since no one else has responded)

There is a certain appeal to allowing regular users to submit  
comments.  Create a new ticket at trac.wordpress.org and upload a diff  
and lets see what this would look like.

As you and Daniel have already noted, this is done intentionally to  
try and avoid having third party code injected into a post.

That said, I thought that admin users had that filter skipped.

Aha! That would make sense - explains why I never personally see the
