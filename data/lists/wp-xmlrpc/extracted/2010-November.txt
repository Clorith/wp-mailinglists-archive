Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] API support for post formats?
Message-ID: <D5E09935-78D1-4C6E-93E0-DABD589F8A56@red-sweater.com>


I am just catching up on progress that has been made to add post formats in WordPress:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats

I don't see anything obvious in xmlrpc.php to indicate that this is being exposed yet for API clients. Does anybody have thoughts about adding this support?

The rules seems to be pretty simple: a post format indicates that the conventional post content should be interpreted according to certain rules. So I think from a client point of view it would be sufficient to be able to read and write the post format term on the post.

This sounds like a sensible proposal.

Could you open a trac ticket for this?

Cheers

Ticket #15405 (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15405).  I hope to

I've now submitted a patch for #15405.  It adds support for a
'wp_post_format' parameter in metaWeblog.newPost, metaWeblog.editPost,
metaWeblog.getPost, and metaWeblog.getRecentPosts.  It also adds a new
wp.getPostFormats method to return an array of supported post formats for a
site.

Take a look, give it a test, and let's see if we can get this committed
ASAP.

Took a quick scan of the diff (haven't actually tried it yet) and
noticed a couple of things:

    do_action('xmlrpc_call', 'wp.GetPostFormats');

should probably be

    do_action('xmlrpc_call', 'wp.getPostFormats');

What is wp_set_post_format()?  I couldn't find any reference to it in -trunk.

Thanks for the catches.  Those were both typos, and I've fixed both in the
newest patch.

wp_set_post_format() should have been wp_set_post_terms() ... Using the
set_post_format() method from this patch as an example:

Sorry for not getting back to this sooner.  I ran through a few tests
with your latest patch and found a couple of times, around the
'default' post format.  See
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15405#comment:8 for details.

Thanks for the feedback.  I'll take a look at it tonight when I get done
with work and see if there's a more elegant way to handle the "default" post
format.

OK, I've added a new patch.  As I mentioned in my note just before it, I
haven't changed too much.  Basically, you can specify "default" as the value
of a post format and it will be converted to "0" automatically.

The actual, hard-coded post format array is:

$strings <http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/_variables/strings.html> = array(
    '0'       => _x
<http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/_functions/_x.html>( 'Default',
'Post format' ),
    'aside'   => _x
<http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/_functions/_x.html>( 'Aside',
'Post format' ),
    'chat'    => _x
<http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/_functions/_x.html>( 'Chat',
'Post format' ),
    'gallery' => _x
<http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/_functions/_x.html>( 'Gallery',
'Post format' ),
    'link'    => _x
<http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/_functions/_x.html>( 'Link',
'Post format' ),
    'image'   => _x
<http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/_functions/_x.html>( 'Image',
'Post format' ),
    'quote'   => _x
<http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/_functions/_x.html>( 'Quote',
'Post format' ),
    'status'  => _x
<http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/_functions/_x.html>( 'Status',
'Post format' ),
    'video'   => _x
<http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/_functions/_x.html>( 'Video',
'Post format' )
);

So you can see a "default" post actually has a post format slug of "0,"
which is what seemed to make no sense when we tested things.  I'm going to
leave the method that returns an array of post formats as-is for now.  It's
returning an accurate slug ("0") even if that seems counterintuitive.  The
same for the methods that get posts, they'll return the set slug for post
formats.

However, the two methods that can set a post format (metaWeblog.newPost and
metaWeblog.editPost) should be more flexible.  After all, we should "be
conservative in what we send, but liberal in what we receive."  So you can
send either "0" or "default" when setting a post format of "default," and
the system will recognize both.

Take a look at the new patch and let me know what you think.  I'd *really *like
to get this committed ASAP ...

I posted an updated patch and follow comments on
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15405

Long story short: zero is now 'default', added validation, return
default if post format is empty, tightened up code just a bit, and
adjusted style for WP coding style.

I re-ran tests against it and everything appears to work.  Hopefully
westi has a few minutes to review it, if he is fine with it then I'll
commit it to -trunk.

Fantastic!  Now let's see how long it takes for third party tools (Live
Writer?) to start using the new API.  Third party publishing tools are
useless unless they implement the cool new features.

Awesome, thanks guys. As for third party tools, Eric, at least my MarsEdit app (Mac only) is anxious to start using this.

Just gotta get the UI done on my end to appropriately restructure the UI for each format. Fortunately my work to do similar for Tumblr should help a bit here.
