Hi,

I'm using the XML-RPC-Framework for writing a little iphone app during my
diploma thesis.
But when I send a request, I only get back an empty data object. What's
wrong?

I tried it with [connection initWithXMLRPCRequest:request delegate:self]
and also with [XMLRPCConnection sendSynchronousXMLRPCRequestrequest]


Live long and prosper,
                             Daniel

Hi Daniel - it's impossible to guess what is going wrong from such few  
details.

I suggest trying to capture a the network traffic from your attempted  
request and response. Examining those may lead to an answer, or you  
could then post them here and give us something to work with in trying  
to help you.

Hi!

I looked around this morning and asked the owner of the server. It was not a
problem
with the framework or my source code. It was the servers's fault.

Thanks!


Live long and prosper,
                             Daniel

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Extending XML-RPC to provide Plugin information
Message-ID: <E70569BA-0C7E-4EB3-A6F1-C6BA42AD896E@gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I was recently writing a plugin where I hooked into XML-RPC to provide  
plugin information to clients using the API. The hook creates an new  
xmlrpc method called wp.getPluginList which returns the get_plugins()  
array. It also adds a couple of extra keys to each plugin array:
	
	Firstly it adds $plugins[$plugin_file]['active'] = is_plugin_active 
( $plugin_file );
	And aslo the latest version of each plugin (using get_transient 
( 'update_plugins' ) ) so the version can be compared by the client  
accessing xml-rpc

I am not aware of the stance of opening up XML-RPC to show as much  
information about the Wordpress install as possible, but does anyone  
think that this could possibly be adopted into core? For the project I  
am working on it would be great to be able to access plugin  
information remotely without the need to the user to install an  
additional plugin on their site.

Thanks

Joe Hoyle

I think it's possible to get something like this into WP.  There would
need to be obvious limitations on it (only accessible by admin users,
make the list filterable).

Best way to submit a patch is to create a ticket -
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ - and then add the patch to the
ticket.

Message-ID: <3DF925C9C76AC3489710833379C81A670DBBB3@TK5EX14MBXC140.redmond.corp.microsoft.com>

I recently made a plugin for Windows Live Writer that lets users attach custom fields to their post.  Now I have few questions for anyone that is more familiar with custom fields then myself.


1)      Wordpress.com doesn't allow you add / edit / delete from the web interface, is there any reason to allow wordpress.com users to custom fields through the plugin?  I can't think of any unless it is possible to buy a premium theme that uses custom fields, is that even possible?

2)      There appears to be some special custom fields like _pingme, _searchme, _encloseme.  Is it common practice to filter out these from the UI?  It doesn't appear you can edit these custom fields from inside of the web admin panel.

3)      Is there a way to get all the custom fields the user has set in the past other than calling a bunch of metaWeblog.getPost?  I looked through all the documentation and didn't see anything, just want to make sure that I didn't miss anything.

Hi Brandon - I have also been working on adding custom fields support  
recently, so I appreciate you raising some of these good questions.

I hadn't even considered the fact that WordPress.com doesn't support  
them out of the box. This raises the question ... doesn't it seem  
likely (or at least possible) that WordPress.com will add support for  
custom fields, perhaps for its paying users, at some point in the  
future?  It doesn't look like custom fields support is currently  
identified in the wlwmanifest, so maybe we should request that this  
information be added.

That said, in the short term, because I expect/hope other blog systems  
will adopt WordPress's conventions for Custom Fields, and because I  
think Custom Fields are generally an advanced "power-user" feature,  
I'm thinking I'll make it possible for any MovableType-variant blog to  
be configured with custom fields support, leaving it to the user to  
ensure that the configuration yields a meaningful result.

As far as I know the _prefixed custom fields are all intended to be  
filtered out of the UI. I'm tentatively planning that MarsEdit should  
also filter them from the UI, and furthermore avoid re-sending them  
(because it could be sending an outdated value). I'm relying on the  
apparent "lazy" behavior of custom fields in WordPress. That is, an  
unspecified value is nondestructive. I'm hoping other blog systems  
will adopt the same conventions so that omission of any particular  
custom field does not indicate deletion.

Daniel

Yes these should be filtered out from UIs they are used for other  
things like page templates and by plugins - in some cases you might  
want to add specific ui for them (page templates) we may need more api  
calls for this to be possible though (listing available page templates).
