Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Blogs that support wp xml-rpc other than WordPress?
Message-ID: <ab7158640811071159q39f88789q8c364a27b3478f16@mail.gmail.com>

Are there any blogging software (other than WordPress) that implements wp
xml-rpc?

There are lists of clients that support wp xml-rpc, but I fail to find a
list of blogging software that supports wp xml-rpc.


Thanks,
Henry

I believe the MovableType has implemented at least some of the WP XML- 
RPC features (http://www.sixapart.com/developers/xmlrpc/).  I'm not  
aware of others.  Developers of other platforms are definitely welcome  
on the list and I'm happy to answer questions.

I think, wp should exposes some APIs to let us search all the posted article, so that we can link some related article in the newly post.

Something along those lines has been suggested in this ticket: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6850

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] PHP scrip for approving comments via XMLRPC
Message-ID: <139308955002984579392273074895595691951-Webmail@me.com>

In preparation for the upcoming 2.7 release I've released a PHP script 
for approving comments via XMLRPC. This can finally allow someone to 
play the role of approving comments without giving them access to the 
WordPress admin. 

I would love hear your thoughts about it.
