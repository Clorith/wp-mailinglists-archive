I'm not too familiar with the roles in WP, but I can imagine a  
collaborative environment where it makes sense to be able to fetch  
posts which you can't edit, in order to have context for editing/ 
submitting posts of one's own.

So the user should be able to fetch any post from XML-RPC that they  
would be able to browse in "Manage Posts" from wp-admin.

That seems reasonable.

I know this is going to come "for free" with Atom support, but in the  
mean time it would be great to finally have the draft/published status  
of posts definitively described in the post attributes.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4982

Does anybody have a problem with just adding a "wp_draft" boolean  
attribute to the posts returned by getRecentPosts?

I guess one gotcha is that to be consistent it would then have to also  
check for that attribute on posts, and interpret it the same way it  
currently interprets the "publish" argument to newPost.

Would it be helpful to know the other possible states? Ryan mentioned

Oh yes - very good point. I was looking at the issue pretty  
myopically. We definitely should expose all the possible states, and  
as appropriate also allow those states to be changed via the API, too.

So maybe some kind of "wp_publishState" ? That contains a text value  
corresponding to one of those?

We'd need to be careful to document the behavior if the different but related states disagree. (For example, publish=1 but wp_draft=true and wp_publishState=pending?) Or at the very least, list the valid combinations of states.

It's also worth pointing out that Trac lets you subscribe to an RSS  
feed for any search, including this one.  Just look at the very bottom  
of the page.

I've found it convenient to subscribe to the feed for XMLRPC tickets,  
just to keep a casual eye on things.

Message-ID: <46FD753A.20506@gunters.org>

Hi there,

I thought I'd drop in and see if I could stick my fingers back into WP
development for a bit.

Some background: Among other things, I did the original implementation
of the metaWeblog and Moveable Type API support. Plus, some of the
underlying work I did there (helper functions like wp_insert_post(),
wp_update_post(), and friends) was later moved into the main core
functions, to provide a higher level of abstraction. I also did the
initial integration of the Atom Publishing Protocol on the wordpress.com
side of things (I didn't write that code, I mainly just modified it to
work in the wordpress.com lighttpd environment).

I don't often have a lot of free time, and consequently, I can sometimes
be slow to move on things. But I'd like to try to contribute in whatever
ways I can.

Hi Doug - welcome on board! I can tell you'll be great to have around,  
if only because you must have tons of historical perspective. Often  
Joseph ends up grappling with what the intent of certain API behaviors  
is, and I bet you'll have opinions about that when such issues come up.

Having your input would be terrific!  Some of the historical "whys"  
have been bit difficult to figure out.

I've been trying to direct people who are developing clients that  
work with WordPress XML-RPC to this list, with specific patches  
usually run through Trac.  What ever time and input you have would  
truly be welcomed.

Hi all,

I'm Paolo, almost 29r, the only one surviving founder of Pixline  
Coding Collective (http://pixline.net), web tweaker since 1998 and  
actually just a php coder.

I just signed myself into the list, even if I'm not really an  
experienced xml-rpc developer, but I'm willing to know more and maybe  
be helpful, as I'm just beginning to work on xml-rpc by myself and  
I'm quite pleased of its power.

More, I'm going to work hard on xml-rpc in my next working project  
(in the radio automation and scheduling area, and somehow  related/ 
linked with WordPress), so I hope to have at least something to say  
or to contribute in the next future.

Please excuse me if I'll need some time to fit better and be concrete  
in this list, I'll try to be more than a lurker.
I've just installed my first xmlrpc blogging client, just to know  
better what I'm going to play with :-)


Bests,
Paolo
