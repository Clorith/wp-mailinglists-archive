Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Retrieving draft or published posts
Message-ID: <F7F1C358-3A57-420F-B111-27BCB82C45AE@ocollet.com>

Hi everyone,

Is there any way to retrieve draft posts only? Or published posts only?

I know I could use getRecentPostTitles for the last X posts, but I cannot assume I will get all the drafts within that X amount, and I don't want to use a large X amount (say 1000) as it's far from being a good solution.

Thanks in advance,
Olivier

You can use metaWeblog.getRecentPosts to retrieve draft posts.

Just specify "draft" for "post_status" and it will retrieve draft posts (or
set "post_status" to "publish" to retrieve published posts).

You can also retrieve a large number of posts by specifying "numberposts"
... if you don't specify this, WordPress will return 10 posts by default.
 Unfortunately, there's not a more efficient way than setting "numberposts"
to a very large number.

There are some more details about the metaWeblog API requests here:
http://mindsharestrategy.com/2010/wp-xmlrpc-metaweblog/ ... also, check out
the inline documentation of /wp-includes/class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php
