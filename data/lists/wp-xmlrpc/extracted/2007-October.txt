Most of the time, the answer is probably, "because that's what worked." ;)

Speaking of clients, are there *any* decent blog clients for Linux?
Darned if I can find one.

I need to make another go at installing Ecto under Wine. I had problems
before, but since then I discovered that I have better success
installing apps from the the emulated DOS shell than trying to do it
directly from linux with something like "wine fooinstaller.exe".

When I was doing the initial development, I used to use Scott Andrew
LePera's online XML-RPC test server for debugging:

Welcome Paolo.  One of the goals of this list is to provide open  
communication to those developing software that talks to WordPress  
via XML-RPC, so we appreciate feedback, bug reports and patches :-)

Hehe.  I've discovered that at this point many WordPress clients have  
worked around some of the oddities in the API.

I know there are some out there, or at least there have been in the  
past.  One of these days I'll get Ubuntu or something in a virtual  
machine and try them out.

Interesting, I've used a Mac app called XML-RPC Client that has  
similar functionality (http://www.ditchnet.org/xmlrpc/).  Matt  
suggested something like the AtomPub APE (http://www.tbray.org/ape/),  
which I think is a good way to go.  We would implement specific  
methods in the test, like metaWeblog.newPost, editPost, deletePost,  
getPost and make sure that the results look correct.  In general this  
could be generic enough that any system that implemented those  
methods would be able to use it, but we've extended some of those  
methods and created new ones that are specific to WordPress.

I haven't started writing this tool, but it is on my list because I  
think it will be a great thing to have going forward.

Well which ones have you eliminated from being good?

I don't remember any specifics off the top of my head, but I do recall
some early testing with Ecto caused me to make some changes. Basically,
Ecto was making some API calls that seemed redundant to me. When I asked
the author about it, he said that he had to do it that way due to the
way that Moveable Type servers actually handled things.

Again, I don't remember the specifics, but you'd probably scratch your
head like I did if you watched the traffic generated by Ecto. I think it
went something like "save the post with publish=false; set categories;
publish post". Whereas, I normally considered this to be a one step
process that could all be handled with just metaWeblog.newPost(),
because that struct can carry category info.

Here's a post on that topic, from the MT point of view:

  http://www.jayallen.org/journey/2003/10/tip_xmlrpc_and_movable_type

I don't recall if this actually caused any problems on the WP end of
things in the early code, but I do know that I thought that the Ecto
author had lost his mind, until he explained that this was how it had to
be done for MT :)
