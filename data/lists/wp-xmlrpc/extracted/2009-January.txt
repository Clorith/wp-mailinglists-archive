Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Exposing more WordPress features via AtomPub
Message-ID: <C43D793F-9DF7-4684-96D8-FDBBF102CA10@randomnetworks.com>


Exposing more WordPress features via AtomPub has been brought up a few  
times and ticket 8777 (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8777) seemed  
like a good case to get some discussion going.

To that end I've emailed the atom-protocol email list about the sticky  
post feature specifically and exposing additional WP features  
generally.  If you are interested in this discussion please check out  
the atom-protocol list archives (http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/) or  
comment on that list.

Thanks.
