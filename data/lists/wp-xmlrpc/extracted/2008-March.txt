I'm the lead developer for Zempt, a (slow developing) desktop blogging
client and I've got a question. I tried to explain the problem in a blog
post -
http://www.simmonsconsulting.com/wordpress/2008/02/29/daylight-saving-time-a
nd-wordpress-xmlrpc/ - but I'll summarize it here.

The problem occurs when you edit a previous post that was written in a
different daylight saving state than what is currently in effect. Say it's
NOT daylight time right now but I edit a post that was posted during
daylight time. When this post is prepared for re-posting, Zempt will convert
the post's date and time to UTC (which, for me in the Central time zone is
-0500 during daylight time) then post it with xmlrpc. The problem is that
currently my blog is set for standard time, which for me is -0600, so when
WordPress processes the post, it bumps up the post date an hour earlier. If
I edit this post several times, each time it is republished, the post date
is bumped an hour earlier each time.

The same thing occurs if it is daylight time and you edit a post that was
written in standard time, except it gets later and later each time it is
posted.

Is there a way to fix this or to tell WordPress what time zone offset to use
for a particular post with xmlrpc?

Thanks &
Cheers,

Toby

Is this the same Zempt that Adam Kalsey and Bill Zeller started?  Are  
you working from code they left on Source Forge?

Getting the date/time right has easily been the trickiest problem  
with the XML-RPC APIs since I started working with them.  This  
specific problem is new to me, but there are other blog client  
authors on the list who have probably seen this.  If they have a  
technique for dealing with this perhaps they'll suggest something.

There currently is no API for determining the current time zone  
offset for a WordPress blog.  That said there are a few things that  
might help you out here.  For metaWeblog.getPost we added a new field  
called 'date_created_gmt'.  This field by definition is ALWAYS the  
gmt date/time of a post, even if there is no trailing Z or time zone  
offset.  This field is also accepted now by metaWeblog.newPost and  
metaWeblog.editPost and if it is present will be used instead of  
'dateCreated' field.  This will provides more precise date/time  
handling.

I'm hesitant to even mention this, but I suppose to could do the math  
and figure out the different between 'dateCreated' and  
'date_created_gmt' and figure out what the offset is.  This of course  
screams ugly hack :-)

We've discussed adding a wp.getBlogOptions( ) method that would  
expose a variety of settings/options for a WordPress blog, including  
the time zone offset.  I haven't done any real work on that yet.   
Hopefully once 2.5 ships (later this month) I'll be able to get that  
in for inclusion to 2.6.

The current time zone offset in the WordPress settings cannot be used
as the correct offset for any given article.

The basic simple example of why not is, if you currently observe
daylight saving time and edit an article that was originally created
during standard time, the correct time offset for the article differs
from the one in WP settings.

I'd really like to see just GMT stored in the database, but this cannot
be done:

- apparently there is no general zoneinfo interface we could use that is
  available to us through PHP (4.x)

- people can move from one time zone to another and we prefer for them
  to be able to reflect the time zone they were in while writing any
  given article

Unless we store the time zone offset for each post in the database, it
probably is the best current(ly available) practice to calculate the
difference from the two time stamps we have in the database already.

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

It would seem to me the easiest thing to do would be to honor whatever time
zone offset is sent in the dateCreated field ... in other words, if the
offset for a particular post is -5 hours, then the post would have:

<dateCreated>2007-10-31 09:00:00-0500</dateCreated>

So this means WordPress would calculate the gmt using "-0500" and assume the
time is local time. But if during standard time and the offset is -6 hours,
then the post would have:

<dateCreated>2007-10-31 09:00:00-0600</dateCreated>

WP would calculate gmt using "-0600".

Does that makes sense?

Cheers,

Toby

I've been burned by tweaking dateCreated in the past.  It's been  
around for quite awhile and adjustments to its behavior just broke  
things.  That's why we added the new date_created_gmt field.

dateCreated is assumed to be the local time, so no need for time zone  
offsets.

I  haven't seen a ticket for this and I didn't want to loose track of

Message-ID: <FA51D7F8-B9B1-4E23-9C83-41F7DF1868A4@randomnetworks.com>


WordPress 2.5 is now officially out ( http://wordpress.org/ 
development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/ ).  There are a number of  
things that this release has for XML-RPC clients (cut and pasted from  
http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2008/03/29/wordpresss-25/ ):

For the XML-RPC blog client developers out there 2.5 adds four new  
methods:

     * wp.deleteCategory( blog_id, username, password, category_id )  
- Delete a category.
     * wp.getCommentCount( blog_id, username, password, post_id ) -  
Provides a struct of all the comment counts ( approved,  
awaiting_moderation, spam, total_comments ) for a given post_id. The  
post_id parameter is optional (or can be set to zero), if it is not  
provided then the same struct is returned, but for the entire blog  
instead of just one post.
     * wp.getPostStatusList( blog_id, username, password ) - Provides  
a struct of all the valid post statuses ( draft, pending, private,  
publish ) and their descriptions ( Draft, Pending Review, Private,  
Published ).
     * wp.getPageStatusList( blog_id, username, password ) - Provides  
a struct of all the valid page statuses ( draft, private, publish )  
and their descriptions ( Draft, Private, Published).

To go along with the new status methods, you can now explicitly set  
the post and page status using the post_status and page_status  
fields. Like wise the status is also exposed via the various get*  
methods. One note about future posts, for the purposes of XML-RPC  
clients we set the post_status to publish when the actual database  
value is future.

The wp.suggestCategories method has been fixed to return data in the  
same format that did originally. I never heard anyone complain about  
this though, so I guess it isn?t getting much use.

Custom fields for posts and pages are now exposed and manageable from  
metaWeblog.getPost/newPost/editPost, wp.getPage/newPage/editPage via  
the custom_fields field. I was really happy to get this in, I think  
there is a long of potential in being able to manage custom fields  
externally.

The mt_allow_comments field now understands the value of 2 to be the  
same as the value of zero. This was done because other platforms  
expect to be able use, so some clients assume that we support it. Now  
we do, but from the WordPress point of view is does exactly the same  
thing as zero.

If the field date_created_gmt is provided in metaWeblog.newPost/ 
editPost, wp.newPage/editPage then it is used instead of the  
dateCreated field. This same field was already exposed via  
metaWeblog.getPost, wp.getPage. By definition the date_created_gmt  
field is always GMT, even if you don?t provide a time zone offset or  
a trailing Z. I?m hoping this will help ease the many headaches that  
have been brought on by trying to deal with date/time issues in the  
XML-RPC blog APIs.

Thanks, Joseph. It's great to have everything summarized like this. It  
shows how much great work you did for this release. It's much  
appreciated!

Now I just gotta catch up in MarsEdit :)
