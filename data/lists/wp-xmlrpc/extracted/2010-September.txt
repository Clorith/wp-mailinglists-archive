This sounds like an interesting way to enhance WP behaviours. And your
plugin is pretty good example of that.

Thanks Eric for your insightful answer.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Restricting available methods on a per blog basis
Message-ID: <AANLkTimxpfMQMsfY5jDqFrUtY9fOPfuAkZ6k7bJyjOC9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using the xmlrpc_methods filter to add custom XMLRPC methods to my WPMU
2.9.2 install in an MU plugin. I'd like to restrict the available methods on
a per blog basis so that if the endpoint being called is
mydomain.com/blogname/xmlrpc.php, only a subset of methods are exposed. The
concern is one of security so that a particular endpoint cannot be used to
influence, for example, voting results.

My initial thought was that I could use the REQUEST_URI and or the
REMOTE_ADDR vars in $_SERVER and switch on those in my xmlrpc_methods
function. We'll also be migrating to WP3 soon so it would be useful to know
if any relevant functionality exists in the later version.

Many thanks for any replies/advice.

Luke Mackenzie.

In the same way that you can add XML-RPC methods using that filter,
you can also remove them.  If you hook into that filter and then do
your tests against blog_id (or some other parameter) to see what, if
any, methods should be removed.

WP3 doesn't bring any change (that I noticed) to the XML-RPC feature, so
Joseph's solution will work great in both WP2.x and WP3. I think I would
match the hostname instead of the blog_id, though.

Have fun !

Hey All,

It appears that when I pull posts from the Wordpress API using
method metaWeblog.getPost and the IXR_Client to make the calls, I lose the
original white space. Any ideas on why that's happening or how to keep it
from happening?

Thanks,

Hello,

I'm not very used to IXR_Client, but I had the same problem in the past,
when parsing XML in PHP with the libxml functions. There seems to be a
behaviour in the parser that removes the whitespaces between tags and in
tags content. Looked like it was 2 distinct problems, too.

My issue was fixed by setting the correct option in my parser initialization
(from the top of my head it was something close to XML_NOBLANKS or
XML_NOEMPTY), and putting my content between [CDATA[]] markers. I'm not sure
your problem is exactly the same as mine, but it may be worth looking into.

Nicolas

Hi,
I,m developing a weblog client for wordpress using java.
i wrote a simple program trying to communicate with wordpress xmlrpc.
but it throws the following error.

Exception: Failed to parse server's response: Expected methodResponse
element, got html

I just put the part of the coding where i input wp-xmlrpc method to
communicate with wordpress.

String result = (String)client.execute("sayHello", params);

// i think sayHello method does not require authentication to return
"hello".

i assume the rest of the code is ok.
can anyone tell me what went wrong in the input??


Below is the program for your reference. i have used apache xmlrpc
libraries.

public class SimpleXmlrpc {

public SimpleXmlrpc() {
}

public static void
main(String<http://www.coderanch.com/t/410859/java/java/String-StringBuffer-StringBuilder-Performance>[]
args) {

XmlRpcClientConfigImpl config = new XmlRpcClientConfigImpl();

try{

config.setServerURL(new URL("http://localhost/wordsite"));
XmlRpcClient client = new XmlRpcClient();
client.setConfig(config);

Object[] params = new Object[]{ new String("usrername"),
new String("password")
};

String result = (String)client.execute("sayHello", params); .
System.out.println("Results" + result);
}
catch(Exception e)
{
System.out.println("Exception: " + e.getMessage());
}
}

Oh!!

The code shoud use  "demo.sayHello"

String result = (String)client.execute("demo.sayHello", params);

Still it throws an exception!!!!

Hi Prasath - it looks like you are not connecting to the XMLRPC API URL, but are instead possibly pointing at the home page for the blog. This would explain why the result is HTML (it's loading the web page).

Try 

"http://localhost/wordsite/xmlrpc.php"

That seems likely to be the API endpoint in your example test installation.

Daniel
