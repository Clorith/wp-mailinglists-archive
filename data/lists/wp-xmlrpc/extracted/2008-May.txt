I haven't seen that style of <!--more--> used, can you point to code  
or docs where that's out lined?

For getting posts (metaWeblog.getPost) the XML-RPC code doesn't do  
any parsing of the post content, it populates the returning struct  
via the existing WordPress function calls.

You can see about tag here:

I known.  Perhaps need to look on  difference between wp_get_single_post and
get_post functions. If I am using tag more then xml-rpc method returns
content divided by two parts without tag.

Ahh, I'd read that page, but missed the section on "Having a custom  
text for each post".

After looking at this a bit more, I don't think there's anything in  
the current APIs to address this issue.  The actual tag isn't  
provided in any of the fields (by design) and it's parsed out when  
creating a new post or editing one via XML-RPC.  That's what the  
mt_text_more field is for.

The case where I see this being issue would be:

1 - User creates new post in wp-admin which includes <!--more My  
Custom String Here -->
2 - User fetches the post via XML-RPC
3 - XML-RPC in WordPress has no knowledge of the 'My Custom String  
Here' part, so that essentially is lost

This isn't an issue for posts created via XML-RPC because there's no  
way to set the 'My Custom String Here' part in the first place.

Solution wise it seems that a new field (more_text?) would be  
needed.  This field would include the 'My Custom String Here' text  
via metaWeblog.getPost and would be used in the <!--more--> tag when  
set via metaWeblog.newPost/editPost.  This puts some extra work on  
the blog client as well, to join and parse things out correctly.

Does that seem like a reasonable option?  I'd like to hear feedback  
from some of the other blog clients out there on this as well.

Also, the custom read more feature doesn't appear to work in -trunk  
right now.  Need to figure out what's going on there before we worry  
about making it work via XML-RPC :-)

Sounds like you've got it right. I'm not sure whether we would let you
customize the more_text from within WLW, or merely ensure that custom
text you set from the web admin is preserved.

I was wrong about this, user error on my part.

Hmm. Back in the day this worked for xmlrpc.

I remember writing the patch that made it work!

The original ticket was [1] - what was the reasoning behind the changes
in 2.5 that removed this feature from xmlrpc posts - was it to better
implement the API as per standards?

If I'm reading the diffs on that ticket right, the assumption was  
that the <!--more--> tag would be in-lined as part of the  
"description" field (in XML-RPC) and not make use of the  
"mt_text_more" field.  I haven't tried it, but I suspect that would  
probably work.  That would make it possible to create a new post via  
XML-RPC that uses a custom more text, although it should be noted  
that this should be done via the mt_text_more field.  Unfortunately  
it would still run into the case that outlined before:

1 - User creates new post in wp-admin which includes <!--more My  
Custom String Here -->
2 - User fetches the post via XML-RPC
3 - XML-RPC in WordPress has no knowledge of the 'My Custom String  
Here' part, so that essentially is lost

You don't even have to create the post in wp-admin for this to be  
true.  And the reason for that is WordPress will break the post into  
the description and mt_text_more fields for metaWeblog.getPost, the  
raw <!--more--> is never included and is therefore lost.  At this  
point the blog client has no way of knowing that what was really used  
was <!--more Some Custom Text Here-->.

At this point I still think that a new field is going to be needed to  
store the breaking tag text in order for this to work.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] page template support in XML-RPC
Message-ID: <4A082C23-4CE7-40EB-A54D-28B9318F7CDC@randomnetworks.com>


You can now manipulate the page template setting for Pages in  
WordPress via XML-RPC:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6098

Ryan committed this to -trunk and it will be in the 2.6 release  
(which will probably be out some time this summer).

Here's the details:

New field in wp.getPage/newPage/editPage: wp_page_template
New method: wp.getPageTemplates which returns a struct like:
	{
		Archives = "archives.php",
		Default = "default",
		Links = "links.php",
		TP1 = "tp1.php"
	}

The template description is used as the key, and the proper template  
value (used by wp_page_template) is the value in the struct.  In  
order to change the template a page uses wp_page_template must be  
provided a value.  If the field is sent with an empty value no  
changes will be made.  The value of "default" is special, that's the  
default page template value and is always available to use.

If you attempt to set wp_page_template to an unsupported value then  
you'll get an error on the wp.newPage/editPage call.

Please try this out and let us know if you run into any problems or  
have any questions, we want to make sure that this works as expected  
when 2.6 is released.
