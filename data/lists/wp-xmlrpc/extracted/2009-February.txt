Is it possible to use the import tool (wp-admin/import.php) via either
xml-rpc or atompub? I think this would be a cool feature for a wp
client to have.

I don't think that anyone has written an importer that uses XML-RPC or  
AtomPub.

I suppose you could do that, though we really should provide a way to  
tell WP that the new data is part of an import (some parts of WP  
behave differently if an import is happening).

Message-ID: <bbd639f50902101411t6bf02158sef19e84e1058c4cc@mail.gmail.com>

Ryan just tagged the 2.7.1 release of WordPress. This being a
maintenance release there are only a few changes to XML-RPC:

Fixed bugs in wp.newComment (ticket 8672)
Fix break of metaWeblog.getCategories that was introduced in 2.7 (ticket 8494)
Added the new categoryDescription field to metaWeblog.getCategories in
light of the problems introduced in 2.7 as part of ticket 8494

And there were no changes to AtomPub in 2.7.1.

I think we're going to have to bite the bullet and add a WordPress  
specific namespace for our AtomPub support.  I've been hesitant to go  
down that road because it seems to lead to some of the same problems  
that I hear people complain about in XML-RPC, namely that instead of  
being able to use the same APIs across multiple blogging platforms  
each one has it's own specific details.

Our next action item then is to come up with a good name space scheme  
for AtomPub in WordPress.

I'm curious what additional Wordpress-specific namespace'd additions  
would be required. The relationships between posts/pages/attachments  
and their comments seem to be addressed by the Related extension. I  
can see an app:control block being needed to specify the spam/ham/ 
heldformoderation flag (like for Draft/Published), but apart from that  
a comment is a (sparse) Entity, right?

The only part I'm unsure of, which may be what you're aludeding to, is  
how to fetch a Collection of children for a particular Entity.

An OpenSearch implementation would go a long way to helping, but I'm  
not sure if that's the Proper way.

Or try and address it with a spec that other APP providers could  
implement - something generic for comment management.

I know there will be other things that will be WP specific like say  
Page Templates but for comments I'm sure a generic solution could be  
envisaged.

Linking back to parents is done with <thr:in-reply-to/> in the public  
feed-atom-comments, following the comment_parent column;

<thr:in-reply-to ref="guid-of-post" href="web-permalink-to-post"   
type="text/html" />

I don't see any method of discovering the inverse relationship,  
however. The public feed-atom-comments has some elements of a  
Searchable Collection, in that the search query is honored, so one  
could ask for all comments on a given post easily enough.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Uploading images - XML-RPC limitations and AtomPub bugs
Message-ID: <854d78250902150609u292a353dt5d75336975acca59@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm writing a Wordpress client that uploads images to a Wordpress blog
using XML-RPC and/or AtomPub.  I'm having lots of problems relating to
the transfer of metadata (Title, caption & description) and I'm hoping
that someone can help me.

First of all, it seems that it's impossible for me to upload this
information using XML-RPC - can you confirm that this is the case or
am I just being totally blind?

Since I came to a dead with that I've started to implement the AtomPub
protocol.  There are a number of issues that I've come across:

The 'edit' URL returned by Wordpress is incorrect.  POSTing the image
will return something like this:

 <link rel="edit-media"
href="http://www.myblog.com/blog/wp-app.php/attachment/file/491" />
 <link rel="edit" href="http://www. myblog.com/blog/wp-app.php/post/491" />

The edit media URL is correct, however if I do a GET of the edit URL,
to retrieve the metadata, the result is empty.   After looking at the
source I realised that it should have been returning this:

 <link rel="edit" href="http://www.
myblog.com/blog/wp-app.php/attachment/491" />

With this URL the GET works, with the exception that the description
isn't returned in the <content> node.

Now, if I PUT the returned XML with a new <title> and description
(<content>) it works quites well except for the fact that the HTML
entities aren't decoded.  Is there a workaround for this?

Finally I note that the GET correctly returns the image caption in the
<summary> tag, however the PUT ignores it, so I can't update the
summary.

Thanks for your help,

Tim

I presume you used the the metaWeblog.newMediaObject method or the  
wp.uploadFile (which really just a wrapper around  
metaWeblog.newMediaObject) method.  With those you really only get to  
provide a the title ("name") of the file being uploaded.  Extending  
those methods to support the caption and description fields would be a  
good thing.

Initially my thought was that you were exactly right on the edit URL,  
but after looking at the code, I'm not 100% sure.  In wp-app.php it  
routes requests with:

             '@/attachments/?(\d+)?$@' =>
                 array('GET' => 'get_attachment',
                         'POST' => 'create_attachment'),
             '@/attachment/file/(\d+)$@' =>
                 array('GET' => 'get_file',
                         'PUT' => 'put_file',
                         'DELETE' => 'delete_file'),
             '@/attachment/(\d+)$@' =>
                 array('GET' => 'get_attachment',
                         'PUT' => 'put_attachment',
                         'DELETE' => 'delete_attachment'),

I've haven't looked through the rest, but I believe the that / 
attachment/491 is the data about the file (title, caption,  
description) and that /attachment/file/491 is the actual file itself.   
That leaves us with edit URI using /post/491 though.  From what I've  
looked at so far using /post/491 appears to be a bug, and needs to be / 
attachment/491

.... sometime later ....

I've got a patch to fix it this so that both /wp-app.php/attachments  
and /wp-app.php/attachment/491 requests use /attachment/491 instead  
of /post/491.

https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9147

Did you write that ticket?


> With this URL the GET works, with the exception that the description
> isn't returned in the <content> node.

Since the <content> element is being used to provide details about the  
uploaded file (type="image/jpeg" in my tests) and providing a src  
attribute, which according to the Atom spec means that <content> must  
be empty:

"atom:content MAY have a "src" attribute, whose value MUST be an IRI  
reference [RFC3987]. If the "src" attribute is present, atom:content  
MUST be empty."

http://www.atompub.org/rfc4287.html#element.content

If I've read that wrong then let me know.  Is there another "standard"  
element that we could use to put the description in?  If not then I  
think this ends up in the area of a WordPress specific namespace'd  
element.

Can you give a specific example that we can use to reproduce this?

Dealing with file management in WP is still pretty rough, so I'm going  
to have to look at this in more detail to see what's happening.  I've  
made a note of ticket http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9148 on  
this issue.
