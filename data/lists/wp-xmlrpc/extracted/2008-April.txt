Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] small change to the way <!--more--> works
Message-ID: <7E386CCC-63D6-4AB9-982F-3D763242AE95@randomnetworks.com>


A small change has gone into -trunk in the way that XML-RPC handles  
<!--more--> for posts.  The new behavior should more closely match  
the way that <!--more--> works in wp-admin.  All it does is remove  
the new lines that were hard coded around <!--more--> in the XML-RPC  
code.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6016

This will be in 2.6, but not 2.5.x releases.

Following up on this issue, Ryan has committed this change to -trunk  
and the 2.5 branch, so we'll see this in any 2.5.x releases and 2.6.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] API for remote access to comments
Message-ID: <001101c89b29$ddb15550$7e4d14ac@nota>

Hello!

I developed comment client for WordPress. Comment client is administrative
tool for manage comments. First upload to your blog xml-rpc server:
http://commentclient.com/download/xmlrpc-comments.php

After install client (all Windows platforms supports, 1.6Mb):
http://commentclient.com/download/wpcommentclientsetup.exe



I need help and feedback. Please tell me about my software.

Providing a way to manage comments via XML-RPC is something that  
we've talked about before, so one of these days it will make it into  
the core WordPress code.  We haven't really talked much about API  
specifics yet though.

When I get a chance I'll take a look at your xmlrpc-comments.php file.

Message-ID: <CC22BE99-1CD0-455C-9425-577F1115EB14@randomnetworks.com>


Ticket 6612 ( http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6612 ) points to a  
blog post ( http://www.franzone.com/2007/07/30/wordpress-xml-rpc- 
patch-for-metweblog-newpost-method/ ) that details a problem with the  
dateCreated field in metaWeblog.newPost/editPost.

I was rather surprised to confirm this bug as detailed in the post.   
I figured if we'd had this problem for so long, one of the blog  
client authors would have complained about it before now :-)

I've attached a simple patch to the ticket that addresses this  
issue.  But date/time fields are particularly fragile in the current  
blog APIs, so I'd really like to get some feed back from folks in the  
field who have to deal with this before pressing forward.

Joseph, I think your instinct to be skeptical because of the lack of  
complaints among blog clients, is correct.

Have you confirmed the problem? I just tested with MarsEdit and  
setting a date on a new post seems fine, with a cargo like:

			<member>
			<name>dateCreated</name>
			<value><dateTime.iso8601>20080414T06:27:14Z</dateTime.iso8601></ 
value>
			</member>

There may be something nuanced that is wrong with the API, but it's  
not affecting me. I suspect it's not affecting other clients, either.   
I haven't looked closely at the fix that the bug reporter is  
proposing. As long as it doesn't break the current working behavior  
I'm not opposed to it.

Daniel

Thanks Daniel.  I suspect what was happening is that they were  
sending the date as a string instead of dateTime.iso8601.  I'm not  
sure why I didn't think about that earlier.

I'll follow up with the ticket on Monday.

Just to confirm, Zempt has no problems specifying a date in a new post with
payload of with 2.5 off the shelf

<member>
<name>dateCreated</name>
<value><dateTime.iso8601>20080412T07:00:00Z</dateTime.iso8601></value>

Some of you may have run into malformed XML-RPC responses from 2.5  
blogs because of an image processing function (exif).

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6571

This is just a heads up that issue has been addressed in -trunk and  
the 2.5 branch.
