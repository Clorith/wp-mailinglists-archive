What about the privacy implications (regarding the contact email
address)?  If such a system were to be implemented I would imagine
that all the data would have to get back to wordpress.org (to be
filtered and/or to avoid spyware plugins) and have the developers
access it through some kind of web interface.

This system sounds very interesting to me.

Here is what I imagine
1) A new function would be created that gathers the information
required and serializes it for use in xml-rpc. The information
required would involve WP-install info and optionally php, mysql, etc
information.
2) the user would be presented with a dialog asking if they want to
submit the report
3) this information would get sent to some domain (likely
wordpress.org) and collected in a database
4) The user gets presented with a "problem report ID" along with the
normal error message which they could use in reporting bugs.
Furthermore the developers would have access to aggregate information
about how their plugins are being used.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] new guy on list writing blog client
Message-ID: <m2o5080587d1004101203h8540c87ag12e5e1ba7d7dde3e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I think I'm the first to write a blog client in tcl/tk.
Anyway, this weekend I implemented wordpress posting with metaWeblog/xml-rpc to
Xpostulate (http://baldwinsoftware.com/xpost.html)
Previously it was only posting to livejournal & clones thereof.
I intend to add blogger functions, as well.
I was having difficulty, and joined the list to ask some questions,
but by the time I received
verification of membership, I'd sorted everything out.

The only blog client I'd found for linux that did wordpress posting,
prior to building my own,
as drivel, so, perhaps my work is relevant in that respect, too.
I might be missing something...there may be more linux clients. I don't know.
Mine, being tcl/tk, is pretty well cross-platform, although developed
on a debian system.
I have windows users who say it's working for them (haven't tested it
only thing but
debian and ubuntu, myself).

I'll stick around and see what develops, all the same.

This list can be a good resource in this area, I know there are other
blog client authors on this list as well.

Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] popular ruby XML-RPC app?
Message-ID: <j2ubbd639f51004161539idfb82ccdq34e81c0ddd5138c3@mail.gmail.com>

We track various stats on WordPress.com, one of them is the number new
posts that come in via XML-RPC.  I like going one step deeper and
looking at which clients are the most popular.  I'm doing this based
on the user-agent string provided, which is fine for most situations.
I'm noticing that we have some clients (reasonably popular ones) that
aren't setting unique user-agent strings though.  For instance:

    XMLRPC::Client (Ruby 1.8.7)

is a fairly popular one, but I have no idea what app/script/service
(or combination) this is from.  Obviously it's using a Ruby XML-RPC
library, but the app isn't setting a custom user-agent so I can't tell
what it is.

Here's another one:

    Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1)
Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

I'd assume that this is a firefox extension app, but again it doesn't
provide any unique data in the user-agent string.

If you the author of one of these please consider adding some unique
text to your user-agent string.  Feel free to drop me an email if you
have any questions.

And if you are the author of an XML-RPC/AtomPub client and just want
to confirm that you're on my list of clients to track on WordPress.com
I'm happy to hear from you as well :-)

Thanks.

If you start seeing "Xpostulate", it's http://baldwinsoftware.com/xpost.html
the client I just released, which is written in Tcl, but doesn't use
the existing Tcl xmlrpc library.
I wrote my own routines for writing posts.

I think most of my users are using LiveJournal, Dreamwidth, and
related/clone sites, but it works
with WordPress, too, and I'm using it there.

Can you send me a sample of what a full user-agent string would look
like and I'll make sure that it's part of the list.

Thanks!

Should be <member><name>useragent</name><value><string>Xpostulate</string></value></member>
but it looks like a few tarballs got out without that in there, in which case,
those versions will likely be identified as Tcl HTTP 2.7 or something.
All future versions will be certain to identify themselves as Xpostulate.

Are you sending that in the body of the XML-RPC request?  I was
referring to the HTTP user-agent string.

Yeah, I was sending user-agent = Xpostulate within the xml-rpc body.
The HTTP request is only sending the xml-rpc body, but should, iirc, identify
itself as Tcl HTTP 2.7.

be well,
