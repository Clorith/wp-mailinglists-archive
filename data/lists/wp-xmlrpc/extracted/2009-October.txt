Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Future Publishing
Message-ID: <468cd95c0910090702w79cc893enb7574526fcc6051@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Are there plans to add a wp_newPost() function to xmlrpc.php, or is it felt
that all requirements are met by blogger_newPost() and mw_newPost()?

I'm just wondering, as I can't seem to figure out a way to Future Publish,
without a hack. It seems to be the only option missing from the whole
post_new.php page.

Am I totally missing something, is there a workaround, or is this not
something that is felt is needed?

Thanks,

AJ Cerqueti

I'm not sure if this technique is what you consider the "hack," but  
with WordPress, an easy way to "future post" is literally to set the  
published date of the post to a future time.  If WordPress sees that  
the date is newer than now, it will automatically save the incoming  
post as a scheduled future post instead of publishing it immediately.

Hi Daniel,

Yeah, but using the existing xmlrpc.php file and functions, how would you do
this?

In blogger_newPost:

$post_date = current_time('mysql');

therefore always posting now as far as I can tell.

However, mw_newPost looks a bit more promising... Do you know where I can
find documentation on how $content_struct is supposed to be structured? I'm
assuming it's an array, but not sure how much or little is required. It
seems to be consulted to check for $content_struct['date_created_gmt'] and
$content_struct['date_created'], and if it finds neither, then sets
post_date to now. I'm hoping this is where you're leading me, as I'm hoping
to avoid editing any of the WP files!

Thanks,

AJ

I wouldn't be surprised if the Blogger API implementation in WordPress  
does not support this. I don't think many people use the older Blogger  
API, since then newer MetaWeblog, MovableType and WordPress APIs are  
more functional.

As for your structuring question, perhaps this MetaWeblog API  
reference will be helpful to you:

I need xmlrpc call to insert a link.
This seems like it should already be inside xmlrpc.php -
How fast can we get that in there, or should I roll my own.

I think we've got a ticket for adding XML-RPC methods for
link/blogroll management.

If you've got a patch that would be great.  If you need something
right away you could do it as a plugin initially.

Message-ID: <468cd95c0910300917m7ad17374t996f21b4f5326ff5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This has clearly been discussed before:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-xmlrpc/2008-April/000188.html

If dateCreated is of PHP type DateTime, posting will succeed, when it's a
string in ISO8601 format it fails.
However, no matter what date the DateTime object contains, it doesn't seem
to pass the timestamp.

E.g.

$title = htmlentities($title,ENT_NOQUOTES,$encoding);
$keywords = htmlentities($keywords,ENT_NOQUOTES,$encoding);
$datetime = new DateTime('2008-08-03 14:52:10');
echo "Formatted ISO: " . $datetime->format(DATE_ISO8601) . "<br />\n";
var_dump($datetime);

$content = array(
'title'=>$title,
'description'=>$body,
'dateCreated' => $datetime,
'mt_allow_comments'=>1,
'mt_allow_pings'=>1,
'post_type'=>'post',
'mt_keywords'=>$keywords,
'categories'=>array($category));

Will post, but date will be current time.

Any ideas?

Cheers,

AJ

Hi AJ, you should post a copy of what the actual XML cargo looks like  
that gets sent over the network.  Otherwise it's harder for the folks  
on this list to speculate what might be wrong.

For your reference, here is an example of a properly formatted  
dateTime parameter that works:

			<name>dateCreated</name>
			<value><dateTime.iso8601>20091029T16:23:02Z</dateTime.iso8601></ 
value>
			</member>

When in doubt about these types of things, a great approach is to find  
a client that works, and monitor what it sends over the network, to  
see what you need to mimic.

Daniel
