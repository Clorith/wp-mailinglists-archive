Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Server error. Requested method wp.getUsersBlogs not
	specified.
Message-ID: <20110705021447.GB6196@panahar>

I have a self-hosted blog on which I am having trouble using xmlrpc.

When I use a client application to access the blog, I get the error:
"Server error. Requested method wp.getUsersBlogs not specified."

I have tried scribefire and Wordpress App for ipad. I get the same
error on both.

There is also another problem with my wordpress installation that may
have something to do with the above error. When i try to login using
http://mydomain.org/wp-admin it takes me to something like the
following and just shows me the login screen again.

http://mydomain.org/wp-login.php?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fmydomain.org%2Fmydomain%2Fwp-admin%2F&reauth=1

My solution to this problem has been to directly go to
http://mydomain.org/wp-login.php and login from there.

With this, the second problem does not bother me too much. The only
reason I mention this is because I am not sure if both the problems
are related.

I have upgraded today to Wordpres 3.2 but have had this problem with
my previous versions as well.

I have tried with scribefire on a clean install and I can't reproduce
this issue. Have you tried disabling the active plugins?

What are the values you have for 'siteurl' (or WP_SITEURL) and 'home'
(or WP_HOME) option ?

Yes, I just did. No luck.

In Settings->General, both are written as http://www.mydomain.org

I understand that it is a problem with my install. Seems like in
several upgrades that I have done since my first install (of wordpress
and plugins) something dirty has creeped in.

I disabled all plugins on your advice but no luck still.


> What are the values you have for 'siteurl' (or WP_SITEURL) and 'home'

I do not have anything specified in wp-config.php. I have these
specified to my base url in Settings->General. All files are in the
base directory itself, so using base url for both should be okay.

This sounds like an htaccess problem to me.

hi wp-xmlrpc! i noticed an odd behavior today with a few methods like
deleteComment and editComment. if you give them a nonexistent comment
id, they say "you're not allowed to moderate this comment," even when
you are allowed. it seems like they should say the comment doesn't
exist. this seems like a bug, since deletePage, etc do tell you that
the page doesn't exist.

can you all confirm? if so, i'll gladly send the patch, it's pretty
trivial. thanks!

Yes, the condition "if ( ! get_comment($comment_ID) )" should be done first.

I am not sure if the first patch cover all the cases.
