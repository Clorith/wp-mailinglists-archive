Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Remove authorization for xmlrpc read-only functions?
Message-ID: <AANLkTimQ32O-PmZfye2aBowdoYYdmZUbYDMh3jeruwh8@mail.gmail.com>

Dear fellow wordpress users / devs,


I have been playing a bit with the xmlrpc functionality of wordpress
and I like it a lot! There is just one thing that I don't fully
understand and that is the following:

Why are the xmlrpc read-only functions (such as mt.getPostCategories,
mt.getRecentPostTitles, mt.getRecentPosts, metaWeblog.getPost,
wp.getComment, wp.getTags, wp.getAuthors, etc. etc.) protected by
password / username?

These functions expose the same data as is available on the blog
itself and the functions are read only. So why not liberate this data
and remove the authorization? For example, tumblr does the same, if
you just add '/api/xml/' to a url of a post then you will receive the
xml output of that particular post.

Two benefits come to mind (and I am sure other people can come up with
more benefits):
1) It makes it easier for third-party developers to build tools to
analyze Wordpress blogs / blogposts
2) It's a (very) small step to make Wordpress ready for the semantic web

Curious to hear your opinion about this and whether this should become
a trac ticket.

Best,


Diederik

Hi Diederik - what comes to mind for me is that it's a coincidence that most of the information in a typical blog configuration is publicly visible.  There are several scenarios in which the content of a blog may be protected:

- The posts are password protected.
- The posts are drafts.
- The entire blog is only visible to registered users.
- The posts contain metadata that is not exposed publicly by a given theme.

I can see your reasoning for having the information be accessible when it just so happens that there isn't any private information among the results, but trying to determine with accuracy whether it was safe to expose a particular set of posts or not would be difficult. The XMLRPC API is just too blunt and its content may include a mish-mash of public and private content.

If you want to get at the content of public posts in a programmatically parseable way, the existing RSS and Atom syndication interfaces are probably a good choice.

Hi Daniel,
Thanks for  your reply. I see your point that not all posts on a blog
are open to the public but this could potentially be alleviated by
making it configurable: default setting could be to make xmlrpc
readonly requests without authorization but if you don't want this
then, using the admin, configure wp that it should ask authorization
for readonly xmlrpc requests.

I am definitely interested in a programmatically parseable way to
access wp content but it seems that it really depends on the
individual blog what is exposed and usually it's only the most recent
comments so I i am looking for a way that exposes more data in a more
structured way.

Best,

Diederik

A plugin could potentially do that.

Along with the standard RSS and Atom feeds this plugin provides some
interesting possibilities -

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=kn5c6yQsSzogkGVyt9c2=dxMcN8hBf7jXi+Yg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've been playing with the XMLRPC API, and I have a few unanswered questions
:

--Is there a Codex page that lists every RPC method, with links to the
corresponding help page ?
I couldn't find any...I usually end up catenating the URL
http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC/ with the method name (ie.
http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC/wp.getComments), and it sometimes works.
I'll gladly create a codex account and set this page up, if it doesn't exist
already...I just wanted to be sure it's not redundant.

--Are there plans for new RPC methods in the near future ?
I realized that many of the WP3 new features (custom taxonomies, custom post
types) don't have corresponding RPC methods...are there plans to add these ?
Is the XMLRPC part of Wordpress still alive ?

--Is it possible adding custom RPC methods through plugins code ? Do you
recommend it ?
I noticed the "xmlrpc_methods" filter, that can be used to add custom RPC
methods programmatically in plugins. I think I read at some point that the
whole Wordpress "engine" is not started when dealing with XMLRPC
requests...In that context, would registering new methods through the filter
and loading the corresponding callbacks work ? And would you do it that way
?

Thank you for your answers.

Nicolas

There isn't a single resource for API documentation because XML-RPC supports
multiple APIs. ?Here are a few references for you:
?
- WordPress API: http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_wp
- Blogger API: http://www.blogger.com/developers/api/1_docs/
- MetaWeblog API: http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi
- Movable Type API: http://www.sixapart.com/developers/xmlrpc/movable_type_api/
?
It is possible to add custom RPC methods through plug-ins. ?It's fairly easy to
do, and you can extend custom plug-in functionality this way (you can use
WordPress as any kind of SOAP or REST service if you have the right kind of
extensibility built-in).
?
To add your own function, you'll need to do the following:
?
function xml_add_method( $methods ) {
$methods['myNamespace.myMethod'] = 'my_method_name';
return $methods;
}
add_filter( 'xmlrpc_methods', 'xml_add_method');
?
The above code will add a new XML-RPC method to core. ?Any external service can
now post a request to http://blogname.url/xmlrpc.php and call
'myNamespace.myMethod'. ?Any arguments passed to that method call will be passed
directly into a PHP function called 'my_method_name'. ?So you'll also need the
following:
?
function my_method_name( $args ) {
global $wpdb; // If you want to use this object to load, store, or manipulate
data
?
$args = wp_parse_args( $args );
extract( $args, EXTR_SKIP );
?
...
}
?
Once your arguments are extracted and stored in variables, you can do whatever
you want with them. ?If you want an example of how I'm using this for plug-in
callbacks, I suggest looking through the code to my Elliot Server project on
Google Code:?http://code.google.com/p/elliot-server/. ?This system adds an entry
point that remote plug-ins can post error messages to so a developer can follow
up. ?It's a work in progress, though, so expect it to gradually change over
time.
?
