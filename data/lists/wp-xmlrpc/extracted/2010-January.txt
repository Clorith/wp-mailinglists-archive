Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Have you seen this before? wp.getOptions() is executing,
 but returning no values
Message-ID: <4B44A6DA.1010406@bringtheblog.com>

Weird issue. I think it's server-related, but I want to make sure.

I use XML-RPC to post content to several hundred blogs. On 95% of my 
target blogs, the wp.getOptions() function works. However, on a few 
sites, wp.getOptions() only *some* of the expected values. I have 
double- and triple-checked -- URL, username and password parameters are 
correct. Furthermore, getLastError() is throwing a "0".

This is a print_r of the getOptions() array when the wp.getOptions() fails.

stdClass Object ( [software_name] => Array ( [desc] => Software Name 
[readonly] => 1 [value] => WordPress ) [software_version] => Array ( 
[desc] => Software Version [readonly] => 1 [value] => 2.9 ) [blog_url] 
=> Array ( [desc] => Blog URL [readonly] => 1 [value] => 
http://www.mysite.com ) [time_zone] => Array ( [desc] => Time Zone 
[readonly] => [value] => -7 ) [blog_title] => Array ( [desc] => Blog 
Title [readonly] => [value] => ) [blog_tagline] => Array ( [desc] => 
Blog Tagline [readonly] => [value] => ) [date_format] => Array ( [desc] 
=> Date Format [readonly] => [value] => F j, Y ) [time_format] => Array 
( [desc] => Time Format [readonly] => [value] => g:i A ) 
[users_can_register] => Array ( [desc] => Allow new users to sign up 
[readonly] => [value] => ) )

It's clear that the XML-RPC call is connecting to the remote WordPress 
instance and the instance appears to be properly configured. The failed 
XML-RPC are not limited to a specific WordPress version, either. Some 
fail on WP 2.9 and others fail on 2.8.x.

Have you ever run into something like this? I am sure there?s a logical 
explanation ? I just can?t figure it out. And before I start digging 
into somebody else's server configuration, I thought I'd ask the group 
if this is a common issue with a simple work-around.

Thanks for your help,
Dan

Hi Dan - first thing I would look into, which you didn't mention one way or the other, is whether the installed plugins are different on the affected and unaffected servers.

Whenever I see unexpected results from the API, I usually suspect plugin interference as a first line of inquiry.

Thank you, Daniel.  Any insight on which popular plugins might fall into 
the category of Usual Suspects?

Not really - I haven't seen the specific problem you're using (but I don't use the getOptions command myself, yet).  But if you can pick just a couple working servers and a couple failing servers and get the installed plugins list, you might notice a commonality. Worth a shot!

Good call.  I'll report back when I find something notable.

Can someone please point if there is any WXR technical documentation
that I can refer to? Thank you.

Thanks Harish for the response.

I see that I can go through the includes/export.php code and come up
with something self... but honestly I do not want to give it a try if
something is already in place or someone has already something like
that. ... WXR generator.

Well, it looks like so far its me I can give the try to write a script
to  generate a wxr from the wordpress database myself. I will see if I
can post back the struggle results.

Thanks for the response again,

Nikhil

The error was related to cURL. 

My service accepts user input via a HTML form. Users that provide a blog 
URL of http://mysite.com when the blog's true URL is 
http://www.mysite.com were getting the error.  cURL doesn't resolve 
properly.

I know that cURL has an option for redirection and that was the initial 
fix.  However, because redirection waits for a timeout before trying 
"the next URL", there was  puts a major drag on loadtimes.  I am doing 
the check manually.  If wp.getOptions() doesn't throw an error and its 
values are null, that's a signal that something went wrong.  At that 
point, I use PHP to add the "www" to the user's URI and re-run 
wp.getOptions().  It's works.

A look at the server shows that the cURL function throws a -1 error so 
that's probably another way to troubleshoot.
