Subject: [wp-xmlrpc] Enable XMLRPC without turn on in the admin
Message-ID: <CAJvdmtEpSEwpzJtovGQaSWvG7VSZXtaux1UjmFKAWFfF+apA7Q@mail.gmail.com>

I want to turn on XMLRPC for users' blog without the need to change
the setting in their wordpress's admin.

Is it possible to say, create a new file xmlrpc2.php and copy this
file to under the user's blog and apply some hack in this file to by
pass the admin setting?

If yes, which file I should look at?

Thanks.

What you need to do is create a new wp_xmlrpc_server class and apply it
using a hook  *wp_xmlrpc_server_class.*

The new class will be as the same as the old class except you must hack the
login method (line 179)
and remove the code segment which checks whether the xmlrpc services are
enabled.
(From line 180 to 184)

Alternatively you could do it progmatically by calling update_option()
on the correct option from code and then just use the core class...

If you're wanting to alter it for all new Multisite blogs for example,
there's a better way of achieving it, through using the installation
defaults hooks/filters.

If you want it one for new sites I'd just update the option.  If you
want something to force it one for several existing sites then
updating the option in the DB is good.  To force them on you could
filter the enable_xmlrpc option.

You can update the database as Joseph and Dion suggested, though this is
enough to get you started:

add_filter( 'pre_option_enable_xmlrpc', '__return_true' );
