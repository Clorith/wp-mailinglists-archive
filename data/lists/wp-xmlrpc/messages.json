    "subject": "[wp-xmlrpc] Setting custom taxonomy on the fly",
    "body": "I'm currently working on a theme, and one of the things I wanted to do \nis to automatically set the Post Format when using an XML-RPC client. \nThis isn't currently supported by the WordPress for iPhone app, for \nexample, so I was trying to hack around it by looking for a string at \nthe beginning of a post, something like:\n   :status: Watching the game and drinking a beer. Life is good.\nI was going to detect the ':status:' string, remove it from \npost_content, update the post on the fly, and set the post format.\nBut I keep running into roadblocks.\nFor one thing, in class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php, the mw_newPost() method \ndoesn't do any filtering of the supplied data. This would be the ideal \nplace for me to do what I want, because I could theoretically just add a \n'tax_input' key to the post data that is passed into wp_insert_post(), \nand everything would just be magic from there. I suggest adding a new \nfilter after the data is compacted into the $postdata array, and before \nit is passed to wp_insert_post();\nSimilarly, another opportunity would be is if there was a filter in \nwp_insert_post() after parsing the args, but before the extract() is \nperformed. This would give another chance to inject/alter the post data \nbefore it is processed.\nWithout a filter in one of those places, it's extremely difficult for a \nplugin or theme to set/change custom taxonomy terms on a post on the \nfly, when the post comes in via XML-RPC.\nSo that leaves us with just a couple of other opportunities to act: the \n'wp_insert_post_data' filter, and the 'wp_insert_post' action. With the \nfilter, I can detect my sentinel string and strip it back out of the \npost, but I can't set the post_format, because we don't have a post_ID \nyet. But if we get all the way to the 'wp_insert_post' action, updating \nthe post content to strip out the sentinel is a problem, because using \nwp_update_post() will in turn call wp_insert_post(), which is a \nrecursive loop.\nOne more place where a filter would be useful is when wp_insert_post() \nchecks for the $tax_input variable (which would have been included in \nthe original $postarr argument passed into the function). A 'tax_input' \nfilter which received the post_ID would be another chance to extend the \nability to manipulate custom taxonomies on the fly, at post creation time.\n(I've also posted this as a Trac ticket: \nhttp://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17156)\n-- \nDougal Campbell \u003cdougal at gunters.org\u003e\nhttp://dougal.gunters.org/\nhttp://twitter.com/dougal\nhttp://twitual.com/",

The\ncategory portion of the post struct is an array, so it probably seemed\nnatural that getCategories should, as well.\nI suggest that we try converting to a struct, and test the major clients\nagainst it to see if anything breaks. If everything still works, then we\nfix it, otherwise, it probably needs to be a 'wontfix'.\n \nSo, the question is, what is the 'name' portion of the parent struct\ngoing to be? The category name, category slug, or category ID? I'm\nleaning towards slug, especially since we already have the ID and name\nin the data portion of the struct. However, I'm guessing that the\noriginal intent was to use the category name as the key. Other\nconsiderations to think about: the spec obviously assumes a flat\ncategory space, but we have hierarchical. Should we try to account for\nthat? I know we're already sending extra info about that in the data\nportion of the category structs, but that's not part of the spec either,\nand we want to be able to handle naive clients.\n-- \nDougal Campbell \u003cdougal@gunters.org \u003cmailto:dougal@gunters.org\u003e\u003e\nhttp://dougal.gunters.org/ \u003chttp://dougal.gunters.org\u003e",

        "body": "Hi,\nThe changes you've made look excellent, though I'm concerned that anonymous commenting is being neglected here. Although a lot of XMLRPC use is blog authors manipulating their blogs remotely, use of the interface by 3rd parties for services such as commenting and pingbacks is something thats only going to get more popular. I believe anonymous commenting via XMLRPC should be enabled by default, just as commenting via the form is.\nIn terms of security, its fair to say that allowing commenting via XMLRPC is no more risky than allowing commenting via the standard form POST action. Also, as with WordPress 2.6, XMLRPC is disabled by default, so requiring a plugin to enable anonymous commenting is only adding another hurdle for blog owners to cross if they want to enable this feature. I appreciate opening another possible entry point for spam is not ideal, but more would be lost by cutting these blogs off from the potential of receiving comments from external sources.\nKind regards,\nAlex Forrow\nSystems Administrator, Favorit Limited\nBlog: http://blog.fav.or.it/\nTelephone: 0845 643 0673\nAddress: favorit Ltd, Building L033, London Road, Reading, RG1 5AQ\nThis e-mail contains confidential information and is for the exclusive use of the addressee/s.

While the WP admin gui is sometimes not too intuitive the frontend and programmability (is there such a word in english...) features are amazing.   \n   \n  I have just published my very first plugin wpLinkMentor http://php.aspcode.net/category/wplinkmentor/ - which extends the XML-RPC interface with some link(blogroll) management functions. I created it simply because I needed it - and published it in the spirit of free code. Maybe someone has a use of it. \n   \n  Just got an email from Joseph where he/you say \n\"We'd like to get wpLinkMentor into the core of WordPress.  I've  \nglanced over the code and looks pretty straight forward, although I'd  \nlike to refine the API some.\"\n   \n  That email makes me\na) happy and kind of flatterned :)\nb) nervous \n   \n  Nervous because while I am a decent coder (C#, C++, VB etc)   \na) I am pretty much a PHP beginner\nb) when it comes to XML-RPC - well lets say I got it working by looking into the existing core code and also in code from Brett Terpstras utw-rpc-autotag plugin. Also I have managed to get some C# client code to work against WP:s XMLRPC. But that's where it ends...\n   \n  Meaning I have indeed gotten some things to work - but have no idea if I have done it \"the right way\", and seldom cares for doing it the right way either, I have problems to solve and I solve them, end of story. But getting into the core I guess would put the \"doing it the right way\" pressure on the code.\n   \n  For example I see some stupid things I have done - for getLinks and deleteLinks I make my own db calls but when last was to implement the updateLink function I discovered there are existing functions in admin-db such as wp_insert_link - meaning I should have used the existing core functions  for getLinks/deleteLinks as well. As I said, I am a WP newbie...\n   \n  The plugin code is here if you'd care to take a look\n  http://php.aspcode.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/wplinkmentor.zip\n   \n  So to end it up - I don't have a clue on how to proceed with this \"getting into the core\" thing. Is it something you (automattic) do, or would you like me to develop it further? Either way I would sure like to get some input on how you'd like the interface - fucntion params etc - to look like :) \n  \nOr/and if there are some obvious stupid mistakes I have done in my coding. \n   \n  I will anyhow try to learn XML-RPC better, cause I have a lot more WP stuff I would like to manage remotely, So I have a lot more rpc functions I will create and publish, soon. \n   \n  Last - sorry for the long mail, lol :)\n   \n       \n---------------------------------\nL?na pengar utan s?kerhet.\nS?k och j?mf?r hos Yahoo!

        "body": "Hi Brandon - I have also been working on adding custom fields support  \nrecently, so I appreciate you raising some of these good questions.\nI hadn't even considered the fact that WordPress.com doesn't support  \nthem out of the box. This raises the question ... doesn't it seem  \nlikely (or at least possible) that WordPress.com will add support for  \ncustom fields, perhaps for its paying users, at some point in the  \nfuture?  It doesn't look like custom fields support is currently  \nidentified in the wlwmanifest, so maybe we should request that this  \ninformation be added.\nThat said, in the short term, because I expect/hope other blog systems  \nwill adopt WordPress's conventions for Custom Fields, and because I  \nthink Custom Fields are generally an advanced \"power-user\" feature,  \nI'm thinking I'll make it possible for any MovableType-variant blog to  \nbe configured with custom fields support, leaving it to the user to  \nensure that the configuration yields a meaningful result.\nAs far as I know the _prefixed custom fields are all intended to be  \nfiltered out of the UI. I'm tentatively planning that MarsEdit should  \nalso filter them from the UI, and furthermore avoid re-sending them  \n(because it could be sending an outdated value). I'm relying on the  \napparent \"lazy\" behavior of custom fields in WordPress. That is, an  \nunspecified value is nondestructive. I'm hoping other blog systems  \nwill adopt the same conventions so that omission of any particular  \ncustom field does not indicate deletion.\nDaniel\nOn Sep 16, 2009, at 1:46pm, Brandon Turner wrote:\n\u003e I recently made a plugin for Windows Live Writer that lets users  \n\u003e attach custom fields to their post.

A change that went in to 3.1.3 is having an effect on the API and how some of my customers use it to edit custom field values for e.g. the All In One SEO pack.\nhttp://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/17994\nThis change altered the behavior of WordPress so that custom fields with a leading _ underscore cannot be edited by clients of the API. It seems that AIO SEO uses (or used? don't know if they've updated the plugin) custom field names like \"_aioseop_title\" and \"_aioseop_keywords\". Presumably this is because they don't want to have the custom fields show up in the standard custom field editing UI in WordPress.\nThe net effect is some customers can no longer edit the pertinent custom field values for 3rd party plugins they have installed. \nDoes anybody know if the WordPress team stance on this is that 3rd party plugins should only use \"non-protected\" naming conventions for their custom field keys?\nIf it is expected to be acceptable for 3rd party developers to continue using these \"protected\" custom field values, then I think the team should consider revising the changes in r17994 so that protected custom fields are still editable via the API.\nDaniel",

From what I've  \nlooked at so far using /post/491 appears to be a bug, and needs to be / \nattachment/491\n.... sometime later ....\nI've got a patch to fix it this so that both /wp-app.php/attachments  \nand /wp-app.php/attachment/491 requests use /attachment/491 instead  \nof /post/491.\nhttps://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9147\nDid you write that ticket?\n\u003e With this URL the GET works, with the exception that the description\n\u003e isn't returned in the \u003ccontent\u003e node.\nSince the \u003ccontent\u003e element is being used to provide details about the  \nuploaded file (type=\"image/jpeg\" in my tests) and providing a src  \nattribute, which according to the Atom spec means that \u003ccontent\u003e must  \nbe empty:\n\"atom:content MAY have a \"src\" attribute, whose value MUST be an IRI  \nreference [RFC3987]. If the \"src\" attribute is present, atom:content  \nMUST be empty.\"\nhttp://www.atompub.org/rfc4287.html#element.content\nIf I've read that wrong then let me know.  Is there another \"standard\"  \nelement that we could use to put the description in?  If not then I  \nthink this ends up in the area of a WordPress specific namespace'd  \nelement.\n\u003e Now, if I PUT the returned XML with a new \u003ctitle\u003e and description\n\u003e (\u003ccontent\u003e) it works quites well except for the fact that the HTML\n\u003e entities aren't decoded.

        "body": "Hi Diederik - what comes to mind for me is that it's a coincidence that most of the information in a typical blog configuration is publicly visible.  There are several scenarios in which the content of a blog may be protected:\n- The posts are password protected.\n- The posts are drafts.\n- The entire blog is only visible to registered users.\n- The posts contain metadata that is not exposed publicly by a given theme.\nI can see your reasoning for having the information be accessible when it just so happens that there isn't any private information among the results, but trying to determine with accuracy whether it was safe to expose a particular set of posts or not would be difficult. The XMLRPC API is just too blunt and its content may include a mish-mash of public and private content.\nIf you want to get at the content of public posts in a programmatically parseable way, the existing RSS and Atom syndication interfaces are probably a good choice.\nDaniel\nOn Aug 3, 2010, at 9:31pm, Diederik van Liere wrote:\n\u003e Dear fellow wordpress users / devs,\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e I have been playing a bit with the xmlrpc functionality of wordpress\n\u003e and I like it a lot!

I think.  I hope that we're both talking about the same thing\n\u003e - the XML returned by the Create Attachement function.\nThe patch on that ticket went into -trunk so it will part of 2.8 and\nit's also in the 2.7 branch, so if we have 2.7.2 release it will be\npart of that.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Now, if I PUT the returned XML with a new \u003ctitle\u003e and description\n\u003e\u003e\u003e (\u003ccontent\u003e) it works quites well except for the fact that the HTML\n\u003e\u003e\u003e entities aren't decoded.  Is there a workaround for this?\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Can you give a specific example that we can use to reproduce this?\n\u003e\n\u003e If you use Lightroom then you can use my new client:\n\u003e\n\u003e http://www.timothyarmes.com/lr2blog.php\n\u003e\n\u003e Configure Wordpress over Atom, stick something like \"Tim's problem\"\n\u003e into the description field for the photo upload, and then view the\n\u003e description in the uploaded photo in the media library.  It'll be\n\u003e \"Tim\u0026apos;s problem\".\nThe problem here isn't that they aren't being decoded, it's that\nWordPress is storing the encoded version (\u0026apos; instead of ') in the\ndatabase.  This is a core WP problem, we'll probably have to take a\nlong hard look at re-arranging the default filter system to stop this\nfrom happening.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Finally I note that the GET correctly returns the image caption in\n\u003e\u003e\u003e the\n\u003e\u003e\u003e \u003csummary\u003e tag, however the PUT ignores it, so I can't update the\n\u003e\u003e\u003e summary.\n\u003e\u003e\n\u003e\u003e Dealing with file management in WP is still pretty rough, so I'm\n\u003e\u003e going\n\u003e\u003e to have to look at this in more detail to see what's happening.  I've\n\u003e\u003e made a note of ticket http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9148 on\n\u003e\u003e this issue.\n\u003e\n\u003e That one's easy.  The put_attachment function doesn't extract the\n\u003e summary.  Not that I can update the title and descritiption.\nWhen it's assembling the data for WP to update the database it's using\nthe content field value (which will always be empty since there's a\nsrc attribute) instead of the summary field value.  I've added a patch\nto ticket 9148 that fixes this.\n\u003e Finally, I've discovered a more serious problem.  It's not possible to\n\u003e PUT an updated image file.  Wordpress returns 200 to say that it's all\n\u003e worked, but in reality it hasn't.  I tracked it down to this code in\n\u003e the put_file function:\n\u003e\n\u003e \t\t$location = get_post_meta($entry['ID'], '_wp_attached_file', true);\n\u003e \t\t$filetype = wp_check_filetype($location);\n\u003e\n\u003e \t\tif(!isset($location) || 'attachment' != $entry['post_type'] ||\n\u003e empty($filetype['ext']))\n\u003e \t\t\t$this-\u003einternal_error(__('Error ocurred while accessing post\n\u003e metadata for file location.'));\n\u003e\n\u003e \t\t$fp = fopen(\"php://input\", \"rb\");\n\u003e \t\t$localfp = fopen($location, \"w+\");\n\u003e log_app(\"tim\", $location);\n\u003e \t\twhile(!feof($fp)) {\n\u003e \t\t\tfwrite($localfp,fread($fp, 4096));\n\u003e \t\t}\n\u003e \t\tfclose($fp);\n\u003e \t\tfclose($localfp);\n\u003e\n\u003e When I PUT to ..../attachement/file/ID the code tries to locate the\n\u003e physical file and overwrite it.  The problem is that $location\n\u003e actually gets the path relative to the uploads folder, so it contains\n\u003e something like 2009/02/myfile.jpg\n\u003e\n\u003e This is then opened by fopen directly, but it needs prepending with\n\u003e the upload folder's path  (you can still see my debug line)\nI've fixed this so that the full path is used and confirmed that the\nfile does then get properly overwritten (is that a word?).\nhttp://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9233\nI'll ask about getting these updated in -trunk and the 2.7 branch as\nwell.\n--\nJoseph Scott\njoseph@josephscott.org\nhttp://josephscott.org/",

There are a number of  \nthings that this release has for XML-RPC clients (cut and pasted from  \nhttp://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2008/03/29/wordpresss-25/ ):\nFor the XML-RPC blog client developers out there 2.5 adds four new  \nmethods:\n     * wp.deleteCategory( blog_id, username, password, category_id )  \n- Delete a category.\n     * wp.getCommentCount( blog_id, username, password, post_id ) -  \nProvides a struct of all the comment counts ( approved,  \nawaiting_moderation, spam, total_comments ) for a given post_id. The  \npost_id parameter is optional (or can be set to zero), if it is not  \nprovided then the same struct is returned, but for the entire blog  \ninstead of just one post.\n     * wp.getPostStatusList( blog_id, username, password ) - Provides  \na struct of all the valid post statuses ( draft, pending, private,  \npublish ) and their descriptions ( Draft, Pending Review, Private,  \nPublished ).\n     * wp.getPageStatusList( blog_id, username, password ) - Provides  \na struct of all the valid page statuses ( draft, private, publish )  \nand their descriptions ( Draft, Private, Published).\nTo go along with the new status methods, you can now explicitly set  \nthe post and page status using the post_status and page_status  \nfields. Like wise the status is also exposed via the various get*  \nmethods. One note about future posts, for the purposes of XML-RPC  \nclients we set the post_status to publish when the actual database  \nvalue is future.\nThe wp.suggestCategories method has been fixed to return data in the  \nsame format that did originally. I never heard anyone complain about  \nthis though, so I guess it isn?t getting much use.\nCustom fields for posts and pages are now exposed and manageable from  \nmetaWeblog.getPost/newPost/editPost, wp.getPage/newPage/editPage via  \nthe custom_fields field. I was really happy to get this in, I think  \nthere is a long of potential in being able to manage custom fields  \nexternally.\nThe mt_allow_comments field now understands the value of 2 to be the  \nsame as the value of zero. This was done because other platforms  \nexpect to be able use, so some clients assume that we support it. Now  \nwe do, but from the WordPress point of view is does exactly the same  \nthing as zero.\nIf the field date_created_gmt is provided in metaWeblog.newPost/ \neditPost, wp.newPage/editPage then it is used instead of the  \ndateCreated field. This same field was already exposed via  \nmetaWeblog.getPost, wp.getPage. By definition the date_created_gmt  \nfield is always GMT, even if you don?t provide a time zone offset or  \na trailing Z. I?m hoping this will help ease the many headaches that  \nhave been brought on by trying to deal with date/time issues in the  \nXML-RPC blog APIs.\n--\nJoseph Scott\njoseph@randomnetworks.com\nhttp://joseph.randomnetworks.com/",

    "body": "Hi Daniel,\nThanks for  your reply. I see your point that not all posts on a blog\nare open to the public but this could potentially be alleviated by\nmaking it configurable: default setting could be to make xmlrpc\nreadonly requests without authorization but if you don't want this\nthen, using the admin, configure wp that it should ask authorization\nfor readonly xmlrpc requests.\nI am definitely interested in a programmatically parseable way to\naccess wp content but it seems that it really depends on the\nindividual blog what is exposed and usually it's only the most recent\ncomments so I i am looking for a way that exposes more data in a more\nstructured way.\nBest,\nDiederik\n\u003e Hi Diederik - what comes to mind for me is that it's a coincidence that most of the information in a typical blog configuration is publicly visible. ?There are several scenarios in which the content of a blog may be protected:\n\u003e\n\u003e - The posts are password protected.\n\u003e - The posts are drafts.\n\u003e - The entire blog is only visible to registered users.\n\u003e - The posts contain metadata that is not exposed publicly by a given theme.\n\u003e\n\u003e I can see your reasoning for having the information be accessible when it just so happens that there isn't any private information among the results, but trying to determine with accuracy whether it was safe to expose a particular set of posts or not would be difficult. The XMLRPC API is just too blunt and its content may include a mish-mash of public and private content.\n\u003e\n\u003e If you want to get at the content of public posts in a programmatically parseable way, the existing RSS and Atom syndication interfaces are probably a good choice.\n\u003e\n\u003e Daniel",

This leaves client XML parsers in a tough situation,  \nbecause some common accented characters are legal in ISO-8859-1 but  \nare outside the legal range for UTF-8.\nI bring this up on the mailing lost both to help Joseph get more  \nopinions about whether it's a good idea to advertise the encoding on  \nthe XML document, and to bring the attention to other client  \ndevelopers, in case their code would be affected by the issue.\nThe symptom \"in the wild\" is that parsing XML-RPC responses for some  \nblogs will fail if your parser assumes the content is UTF8 and comes  \nupon one of these accented characters.\nDaniel",

        "body": "Luke,\nI've worked with WordPress' XMLRPC system before (using a WP-Hive\ninstallation with multiple separate blogs similar to a WPMU set-up).  The\nnew approach you're using is definitely simpler and easier to implement (I\ntried the 5ubliminal one as well the first time).\nWhether or not you can distinguish between separate blogs in a MU\ninstallation depends entirely on how you build your handler function.  You\ncan build it to distinguish the separate blogs, to only function on specific\nblogs, or to treat the entire system as a single WordPress site.  It's all\nup to you.\nYes, you can retrieve and post to custom fields.\nAbsolutely writing a plug-in is the way to go.  The only other options are\nto change core files (BAD idea) or to build it into your theme, in which\ncase it could ONLY be used on MU sites using that theme.  Build it as a\nsite-wide MU plug-in that can be controlled on a site-by-site basis by the\nglobal admin.\n~Eric\nEric Mann\nwww.eamann.com\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:wp-xmlrpc-bounces at lists.automattic.com] On Behalf Of Luke Mackenzie\nSent: Friday, May 14, 2010 5:52 AM\nTo: wp-xmlrpc at lists.automattic.com\nHi,\nI have been tasked with creating an API for retrieving and adding content to\nWordpress from a flash application and legacy CMS (non-PHP).

The new field is called  \n\"custom_fields\" and an array of structs, with each struct containing  \nthree entries: id, key and value. Something like this:\n     \"custom_fields\" = (\n         {id = 129; key = city; value = Sacramento; },\n         {id = 130; key = city; value = Sandy; }\n     )\nCustom fields can be added via wp.newPost/editPost and  \nmetaWeblog.newPost/editPost following the same general format. If a  \ncustom field entry included with a post contains an \"id\" value then  \nan update is done. If there is no \"id\" then an add is done. If there  \nis an \"id\" value and no \"key\" value then the custom field with that  \nid is deleted.\nI'm also open to the possibility of a wp.addCustomField(blog_id,  \npost_id, key, value) style methods if discussions show that there is  \nan interest and a reasonable use for them.\n--\nJoseph Scott\nhttp://joseph.randomnetworks.com/",
