Hey all,

I know this seems to be a common thread, but reading through old posts  
here and scouring the codex and forums is not bringing me to a solution.

It's pretty simple - I'm looking for a way to add a simple Rewrite tot  
he WP Rewrite rules..  Following the codex example, and other  
examples, this seems like it should work:

function gigpress_feed_rewrite($wp_rewrite) {
     $feedrules = array('^shows.xml$' => 'wp-content/plugins/gigpress/ 
feed.php');
     $wp_rewrite->rules = $feedrules + $wp_rewrite->rules;
}

add_filter('generate_rewrite_rules', 'gigpress_feed_rewrite');

But no go - I just get redirected back to my index.

f I manually add this to my .htaccess file, above WP's conditions:

RewriteRule ^shows.xml$ wp-content/plugins/gigpress/feed.php [L]

It works like a champ.  And I am indeed updating my permalinks on my  
options page.

Any ideas as to what I'm missing here?  Any help would be greatly  
appreciated - thanks.

Derek

Would using array_merge() instead of using + work? Just shooting out in the
dark here, I've never seen anyone use + to merge arrays before, but it could
be done, knowing PHP ;).

To get your rule into .htaccess you probably want the filter
"mod_rewrite_rules" which lives in the method of the same name.

Note that it filters the rules as a string rather than an array.

As well as Adding the filter, you need to force WP to actually make use of the filter, You'll need to force a refresh of the Rewrite rules.

eg:

//If the rewrite rules are regenerated, Add our pretty permalink stuff, redirect it to the correct queryvar
add_action('generate_rewrite_rules', 'test_add_rewrite_rules');
function test_add_rewrite_rules( $wp_rewrite ) {
	$new_rules = array( 
		'^shows.xml$' => 'wp-content/plugins/gigpress/feed.php',
		);

	$wp_rewrite->rules = $wp_rewrite->rules + $new_rules;
}

register_activation_hook(__FILE__,'test_flush_rules');
function test_flush_rules(){
	//Flush the rewrite rules so that the new rules from this plugin get added, 
	//This should only be done when the rewrite rules are changing, Ie. When this plugin is activated(Or Deactivated), For simplicity while developing using WP Rewrite, I flush the rules on every page load
	global $wp_rewrite;
	$wp_rewrite->flush_rules();
}

i'm not 100% sure if you can actually specify a file like this: 'wp-content/plugins/gigpress/feed.php',
WP Rewrite rules are NOT added to the .htaccess file unless you hook the .htaccess generation hook AFAIK, Instead, all rewrite rules are done internally by WP.

Instead, you'll need to use something like this:

add_action('generate_rewrite_rules', 'test_add_rewrite_rules');
function test_add_rewrite_rules( $wp_rewrite ) {
	$new_rules = array( 
		'^shows.xml$' => 'index.php?feed=gigpress',
		);

	$wp_rewrite->rules = $wp_rewrite->rules + $new_rules;
}

add_action('template_redirect','test_template');
function test_template($arg){
	global $wp_query;
	if( !isset($wp_query->query_vars['feed']) )
		return $arg;
	
	//Include gigpress feed code here...
	die(); //To stop anything futhur being run
}

I've been meaning to(For the last few months, Since the last question on this came up and i wrote all this example code) to write up a posting about using WP Rewrite, From memory there isnt too many resources available other than the codex, and thats highly limited.
For a example of how to use WP Rewrite, Have a look at this test plugin: http://dd32.id.au/files/wordpress/test-rewrite.php 

Keep in mind, That in the rewrite rules, if you specify 'index.php?feed=gigpress', then feed=gigpress IS NOT present in $_GET, WP never fills the superglobals when it does rewrite, instead you access it via the $wp_query object, wp_query also needs to be made aware that it should expect to recieve a parameter, That can be done via another filter which is shown in the plugin linked to, I've not included it in this code sniplets in this message as 'feed' is expected as WP uses it for the RSS feeds and whatnot.

Derek -- as someone else mentioned, the key is that you need to flush 
the rewrite rules as well as definining a filter for 
generate_rewrite_rules.

The last example at the bottom of this Codex page spells this out:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Queries

It builds upon other examples that show all the pieces you should need 
to do what you are trying to do. At least, I hope so. :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] making the code editor the default view
Message-ID: <475148F6.6000701@bolarus.de>

Hi!

I recently wondered wether it would be possible to have both the visual
editor (tinyMCE) and the code editor switched on, but making the code
view default. I looked around a bit and found a lot of threads on the 
WordPress forum asking for this, but without a solution. And looking at 
the code in wp-includes/general-template.php (WP 2.3.1) I don't think 
that's easily possible right now.

I just wonder if there is a way to do that and if not, if there would be
interest to add this functionality.

Greetings,
Johannes

I would be interested as well. I believe what you're suggesting should
become the behaviour for unchecking the "use visual editor" in your
profile, rather than disabling TinyMCE completely.

Where would be the point in that? If you want the default view to be code,
why not just disable TinyMCE and/or just hit the button every time? I don't
understand...

Or maybe just have a box that says "Disable Visual Editor" which will 
completely eliminate TinyMCE. Also, there can be a dropdown option where 
you can select your default tab or "view", whether that be code or the 
visual tab.

Confluence (wiki) has it right:
TinyMCE (3 tabs for 3 modes). When you switch to non-default tab, a tiny
text link appears: "Make this the default editor"

Idea off the top of my head as I don't have a WP installation to hand
to look myself.

Find the JavaScript function that is called when you click on the
'code' tab. Write a plugin that calls that function when the post
writing screen finishes loading, which should make the editor switch
to code view, still leaving the visual tab available.

Just an idea.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Help with wp_rewrite?
Message-ID: <5FBA210C-5054-434E-A2C3-717D6952CE18@amphibian.info>

Hey all,

Thanks for the words of advice Andy, DD32, and Jennifer - all helpful.

Andy's tip about mod_rewrite_rules looked promising, but alas, WP  
tacks those onto the end of everything else, and my rule gets squashed.

However, upon further investigation, it looks like what I really  
wanted to do was use add_feed.  It's really poorly documented, but it  
does work.  This is what I've found works:

// Flush our rewrite rules before running add_feed
function gigpress_flush_rules(){
	global $wp_rewrite;
	$wp_rewrite->flush_rules();
}
register_activation_hook(__FILE__,'gigpress_flush_rules');


// This is for the init action hook
function add_gigpress_feed() {
	add_feed('gigpress','gigpress_feed');
}
add_action(init,'add_gigpress_feed');

(This is added on init as per: <http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-trac/2007-July/014207.html 
 >)

// Build the feed
function gigpress_feed() {
	// function that prints the XML
}

HOWEVER!  It's only working using direct queries, ie:

www.example.com/?feed=gigpress

This is alright - but I don't totally see why this can't work:

www.example.com//feed/gigpress

Surely when using add_feed, WP should treat it as any other feed -  
including giving it permalink treatment? If WP knows that 'gigpress'  
has been added as a valid feed variable, shouldn't it be able to parse  
the permalinks in the same manner?

Best,
Derek

Message-ID: <c8f37c930712012121w2af2d3ael511620752d654e03@mail.gmail.com>

(Cross-posted to testers and hackers lists)

Trunk now hashes passwords with phpass. See ticket 2394 for details.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2394

Backup up your users table before updating trunk is advised.  Whenever
a user logs in via wp-login.php, their hash will be updated to use the
new algo.  If you want to roll back, you will need a back up of the
users table that contains the old md5 hashes.

Changes to cookie authentication are coming soon as well.  You will
probably want to avoid trunk for the next couple weeks unless you want
to help debug login problems.

I disagree, I think it should just remember where you last left it, and 
start there.

Message-ID: <1d715d360712021055p51e818abic44f80f74aa963ef@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm revisiting a plugin I've written using WP 2.3.1, and I'm seeing
undesired behavior in get_posts.

my plugin, fancy-categories, displays the posts in a given category
directly in the sidebar list. I use
get_posts("numberposts=0&category=$catID") to get the posts of a given
category. The problem is that this code returns not only posts in the
$catID category, but also posts in the categories that are SUB
categories to $catID.

the documentation here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts says that:

 category
    (integer) Only show posts from this category ID. There is no default.

This makes me think that get_posts should only return those posts
directly in that category. I also believe this is how it worked prior
to 2.3 (but I have yet to verify)

is this a bug? or a "feature". If it's intended behavior, I think the
get_posts open should allow you to exclude posts in sub-categories

thanks,
Andy

I'm sure there are a few scenarios for using both editors. I myself like 
to use the code view most of the time, because it's easier and faster. 
But I switch to the visual editor when I insert an image for the simple 
and somewhat ridiculous reason that in the code view the image gets 
inserted as <img src='...'> (as opposed to <img src="...">). Well, it's 
my blog and valid or not, I don't like the single quotes in the HTML. 
;-) Switching between the editors is usually faster than changing the 
quotes manually.

Thanks for the idea. That would most probably work. But what bothers me 
a little bit about the visual editor is the time it takes to load. I'd 
like that to be reduced, and switching to the code view with a 
JavaScript function wouldn't help from this point of view. ;-)

That sounds like a great idea. I certainly wouldn't care if I could make 
the code view the default or if WordPress just remembers where I last 
left it. So, what would we need to do to move this along for one of the 
next versions? I'm kinda new to WordPress and not really sure I could do 
this myself. *g* Would be willing to help, though, if that's possible.

Bye,
Johannes

This would be somewhat helpful I suppose, however it is not a  
complete solution.

- While this works for content snippets on a page, the management  
interface to get to the widget content from editing a page is very  
awkward.

- You can only edit widget content when it is in a sidebar, so you  
need to have some kind of dummy sidebar with a whole slew of widgets  
in it. This is confusing for end users that have to maintain the data.

- This does nothing to address the "thank you page" scenario where  
you simply do not want a regular page to be available via search or  
included in your sitemap.

I realize that we can solve these issues by modifying each piece of  
functionality (search, sitemaps, etc.) individually, but having a  
single control to do so would be a much nicer and more maintainable  
solution.

Message-ID: <8f93a7390712030211l1d8b8fb9xa8d32cfc6e3e0d31@mail.gmail.com>

I've been playing around with the plugin update checker (writing a new
plugin that uses the data) and noticed that the data retrieved from
WP.orgis displayed raw:

printf( __('There is a new version of %s available. <a href="%s">Download
version %s here</a>.'), $plugin_data['Name'], $r->url, $r->new_version );

Does this mean WP.org automatically htmlspecialchars() the version number
and such or was this overlooked?

What if I commit a new version of my plugin and put this as the version
number: 1.2.3<script>alert('omfghax');</script>

The same goes for plugin titles.

Wondering both for my plugin's sake and for security's sake.

In the last few weeks, I have received between one and three comment
notification emails _per_day_ from my WordPress blog informing me of
new comments on my blog, but all of them have turned out to be spam.
That's about 20 comments in the last couple of weeks Akismet has
mislabelled.

Has anyone else been encountering this? Since 2005, Akismet has been
flawless -- it's only started going awry lately.

I know Akismet is working -- it still catches around 20 spam comments
a day, but one or two get through. Perhaps spammers have been abusing
the Akismet API by submitting spam as ham to confuse the bayesian
filter?

The spammers are just getting smarter. I've been getting a lot of sneaky
spam lately that Akismet says is okay as it's so deceiving. Luckily, I use
Spam Karma 2 combined with it's Akismet plugin, so when/if Akismet fails,
SK2 usually picks up the slack and catches it regardless.

I'll second that.  On top of that I also run Bad Behavior, and  
between the three I rarely get any spam through.  (Though I did  
actually get one last week.)

I agree, maybe a hidden input field with the value edButtonHtml och
edButtonPreview or whatever id the switcher has.

Then save it as a cookie..

There is no need for any of that - you just add a JavaScript function to add
the variable to the cookie when a different tab is selected.

edButtonPreview or whatever id the switcher has.

Then save it as a cookie..

But if the user has his cookies cleared, that preference goes out the
window. Of course, that's if this preference is really that important.

I think it's pretty much an accidental feature, but for me it's
important that the "turn off visual editor" option actually disable
the whole mess completely because at least right now having the whole
thing turned off means that there is less formatting of the post that
goes on. My best example was that even the code view was chewing out
<embed> at savetime but if you turned off the visual editor and used
the old quicktag system the <embed> would survive (i think this was
fixed but there are more bugs floating around that I'd still like to
avoid in some cases).

There's probably a relatively simple way to make the code view use the
same filters as the oldschool view, but I thoroughly appreciate being
able to tell people with no tech background who ask me why their posts
are getting borked to just turn off the setting in their profile and
having that solve the problem 90% of the time.

Aside from that, +1 for remembering where you left it AND for the link
when you switch to your non-default tab, whichever is ready first,
though if we can avoid loading all the TinyMCE wysiwyg js for people
with code default, that would be awesome.

I'd prefer the editing mode set per post and saved along with that post,
and in an ideal world have some administration of who can change to what
mode where - though this is probably plugin territory.

So maybe have a user_editmode_preference & post_editmode_restriction

(where post_editmode_restriction > user_editmode_preference ;-) )

Message-ID: <ae81acd10712030933s39632e7cpcb584b907c30057a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello there

Please forgive this off-topic thread, but this list is just a place
where I "know" and trust a few people :)

I'm currently renting a dedicated box which is not too bad and pretty cheap:
- 2 GHz CPU
- 160 GB of storage
- 1 GB of RAM
- unmetered 100MB line
- 36 euros (about $53) a month.
- The box provider is a very well known, serious & established French
ISP (Free, 2nd largest ISP in France) and the offer (dedibox.fr) is
only available to French residents (no clue why, but it is)

I'm looking for someone to share this dedicated box with. This person
would be Linux fluent enough to set up, configure, maintain &
troubleshoot if needed the basic services needed (Apache, MySQL,
FastCGI, PHP, FTP). I know a thing or two about server management, I
rather comfortable with the SSH shell, but I'm not just self confident
enough to go totally on my own, hence the leet skilled buddy hunting.
The site would end up running my main WP blog, a couple of low traffic
WP blogs, and your stuff as well.

You won't want to pollute the list with off topic replies, but feel
free to mail me for more details & stuff.

Looking forward to reading from you !

Cheers,

Ozh

You probably need to flush the rewrite rules after doing add_feed, so 
that your special feed/gigpress rewrite rule gets created. Probably 
adding the add_feed line inside your flush_rules function would do the 
trick. I'm not entirely sure, but it seems like it should...

Message-ID: <20071204012816.23F93DB1106@akswprod0.informatik.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi all,

The following wordpress related project was created on Cofundos.org (a platform for describing open-source project ideas and pooling resources for their implementation):

*Sinapsi. A semantic WordPress* by lorenzodetomasi
Tags: MySQL PHP Calendar Plugin Atom RSS wordpress semantic blog content_management_system cms geolocation events news tag geo_rss xhtml strict microformats xforms Creative_Commons
http://Cofundos.org/project.php?id=69

Project description: A social/semantic evolution of WordPress platform. 
Features

	multidimensional (faceted) classification interface that fully adopt categories potentialities, as in facetmap demo;
	dynamic admin interface based on Xforms;
	full support of Microformats;
	default license selector for the whole site, based on Creative Commons WpLicense;

	license selector for each post and page that overrides the default license;
	detailed semantic description of authors (persons, individuals), based on Microformats hcard and hresume, published on personal pages with curriculums;
	detailed semantic description of works (resources),  and author’s portfolios;
	detailed semantic description of groups (associations, companies, teams etc.);
	detailed semantic description of persongroup relationships, that integrates actual xfn
	event semantic description based on the next new version of iCal and event calendar based on Microformats hcal;
	multiple languages plugin that affects the whole interface (header, footer, pages,  templates, categories, calendar etc.);
	language markup based on Iso standard;
	different external and internal links management, like Wikipedia and Plone (i.e. W3C and [p=9]);
	general social digging page template, for all posts;
	category related social digging page template, for specific category/ies;
	integrated facetag support;
	integrated geolocation for each post, based on GeoPress;
	dynamic post quotation (total or partial,  or ) with xhtml code includes and Ajax;
	xhtml strict + css validated code.

Steps

	We’ll try to use existing WP templates, plugins and widgets, modifying them if necessary and releasing a semantic version (i.e. geolocation->wikimap, locallinks->wordpress wiki, events->EventCalendar3, Semantic MediaWiki,  SemanticForms).
	We’ll use WordPress custom fields and some markup to enter attributes and relations directly into text. These attributes are then stored as custom values and can also be viewed, changed, made as such.
	We can display a rdf box below each post, using the attributes and relations defined within the post. Also all standard wordpress information (author date etc.) can be used in this rdf.
	We’ll make an interface for these custom value relations and attributes that resides in the edit-post page. This interface would be more informative and easier to understand than the (coded) custom value pairs.
	We’ll implement a way of listing posts using attributes and relations (queries) and a way of searching using these semantics.

Hmm, but I imagine SK2 still doesn't work well with WPMU (in particular,
as a mu-plugin non-configurable by users).

I have the same thing, and Bad Behavior too. But there's still a handful 
getting through anyway. Sometimes 3 to 4 a day, some days it's just one 
or two. I know it's crazy, but every time I get them, I ban them. I have 
a text file with TONS of spammer IPs in it that I gotta go through and 
manually ban then as well. It will take forever, it might be pointless, 
but it's something I want to do.. :P Same goes for those proxy IP 
addresses... I have proxy and spammer IPs listed here. Those are the 
current proxy IPs I banned... Anyway, I'm going way off topic now. Sorry.

You can't fool Akismet that way, they've been trying that since the 
beginning. :)

If you send your API key to the support form on akismet.com/support I'll 
take a look at it personally.

This has happened to me since I first installed Akismet, I presumed it
was normal behaviour. Every day I get 4-5 spam comments in my
moderation queue rather than being flagged as spam.

Obviously it's better to err on the side of spammy caution, but are
there people to which this isn't happening?

there can be other reasons for getting spam in the moderation queue,
besides akismet mislabelling them; for instance, if akismet couldn't be

I know :) Most of the time rechecking the queue does nothing, and when
it does it's usually when I've left it for a while. Maybe I just get
spam a little earlier than other people, heh.

I use SK2 in WPMU with some slight modifications. I haven't made the change
to allow for centralized management, so each blog still manages their own
settings (and their own spam), but it's working fine from the mu-plugins
folder for me. I do plan to make those further mods, but I'll have to check
with Dave regarding redistributing those changes, since IIRC the license
doesn't allow for redistribution by default.

If you're up for a bit of dev work, you could always just have a plugin that
runs on new blog registration that copies the SK2 settings into all new
blogs and then prevents the management page from being shown to anyone who
isn't an overall site admin.

As for Akismet, I find that it's generally correct when it labels an entry
as "spam", but occasionally it does label some actual spam as "ham" (false
negative?)

The way I tackle this is to run Akismet as an SK2 plugin only, and assign
negative karma to a comment akismet says is spam, but not assign any
positive points if akismet says it's OK, since that is the part I have found
to be not authoritative. That part of it (the SK2 plugin) I could definitely
redistribute if anyone's interested.

I also use Bad Behavior to prevent a lot of stuff from getting past the
"front lines", but for those that do (100-200 per day on average), the
combination of Akisment and SK2 seems to work well for me.

The get_posts function in post.php doesn't look like it will do what
you say it's doing. It doesn't merge children into the category part
of the query. It's adding this to the where clause

AND (wp_posts.ID = wp_term_relationships.object_id AND
wp_term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id =
wp_term_taxonomy.term_taxonomy_id AND $wpdb->term_taxonomy.term_id =
$category)

That's not going to get children categories too.

Are you use that you're not using $wp_query->get_posts() instead?
Because that behaves differently.

Even if WP.org is safely doing the right thing, this is a security
issue that needs to be fixed. It's unsanitized data from a third party
site.

Okay, so spoofing the DNS to redirect what "wordpress.org" means to
the webserver would be a bit of a long way to go to hack a website,
but it can still be done.

G'day,

I use individual email addresses for each mailing list I'm on. I'm 
starting to get a fair bit of spam (700 in a week) to the address for 
this list. Is there anything the list admins can do to improve the 
situation?

I'm guessing the standard obfuscation on list archive is probably not 
sufficient to keep a smart harvester at bay. Stripping characters from 
emails would probably work better, or something like that.

I don't have a lot of time now, just wanted to float the idea.

I gave up on obfuscation and security via obscurity -- I receive around 1600
spam *daily* to this address which post literally everywhere.

Solution: hosted gmail which filters out all but one or two spam per day.
Quite impressive.

(though Gmail _does_ have false positives, I wouldn't know since I never go
into the spam folder to check)

I too have Google host my @viper007bond.com e-mail. It's especially useful
since they support catchalls and now SMTP (I use their HTTP interface
though). Plus, the 14000 spam e-mails it's caught in the past 30 days and
receiving new mail notices via GTalk is nice (login with your full e-mail
address).

Anyway, as for getting spam at your address, nothing anyone can do about it.
Mailman isn't handing it out last I looked and spammers already have your
e-mail address via an archive, official or not.

Google's at least makes you fill out a CAPCHA before you can see the full
addresses:

But there are other archives that, quite unfortunately, don't.

And all an email harvester has to do is subscribe to a list his or herself,
and everyone's email is compromised - nothing anyone can do about that.

On a sidenote - Viper, you mean IMAP, right? SMTP has been there from the
very beginning.....

I too have Google host my @viper007bond.com e-mail. It's especially useful
since they support catchalls and now SMTP (I use their HTTP interface
though). Plus, the 14000 spam e-mails it's caught in the past 30 days and
receiving new mail notices via GTalk is nice (login with your full e-mail
address).

Anyway, as for getting spam at your address, nothing anyone can do about it.
Mailman isn't handing it out last I looked and spammers already have your
e-mail address via an archive, official or not.

Google's at least makes you fill out a CAPCHA before you can see the full
addresses:

Er, yeah, I meant IMAP. Thanks.

BTW -- here's a solution to the spam problem: any e-mail that is sent to
your list exclusive e-mail address that doesn't have "[wp-hackers]" as the
beginning of the subject, have it be filtered directly into the trash.
Problem solved. :)

The data is sanitized on the WP.org server, so everything's ok there.

I agree that the client (your WP blog) should also sanitize it as  
well.  Thanks for patching!

The problem with that is that many people contact those on-list privately via the address.
For many here, This address will be the only one known to them, Its also the only one i get spam on though.. So its highly tempting to drump all non-mailing list messages :)

Well, if this list didn't do stupid Reply-To munging, we wouldn't have
that problem.

For a long time, I have disliked the idea of munging, and there have
been a couple of cases where I have meant to reply off-list and
accidentally replied on-list, and that was all Reply-To's fault, because
of the inconsistency with mailing lists that are more intelligently set
up.

All the addition of Reply-To does is make it harder to reply off-list to
somebody. It does not make it easier for somebody to send to the list.
All mail clients have a Reply All feature, and if the one you're using
doesn't, well, it's your fault -- there are plenty of free alternatives
that do.



--
P.S. Sorry about the tone of this email -- I'm simply expressing my
thoughts. To tone it down would mean being dishonest, IMO.

I use my web host's spam filtering, and I get zero spam through this list.

I gave up on obfuscation and security via obscurity -- I receive around 1600
spam *daily* to this address which post literally everywhere.

Solution: hosted gmail which filters out all but one or two spam per day.
Quite impressive.

(though Gmail _does_ have false positives, I wouldn't know since I never go
into the spam folder to check)

G'day,

I use individual email addresses for each mailing list I'm on. I'm
starting to get a fair bit of spam (700 in a week) to the address for
this list. Is there anything the list admins can do to improve the
situation?

I'm guessing the standard obfuscation on list archive is probably not
sufficient to keep a smart harvester at bay. Stripping characters from
emails would probably work better, or something like that.

I don't have a lot of time now, just wanted to float the idea.

Cheers - Callum.

Big -1 to this. 99/100 times, I want to reply to the whole list. Reply all
is a major pain and it'd mean the poster would get my e-mail twice.

And on the subject of pet peeves, mine is people who change the subject of
their e-mails. :P  Makes GMail start a whole new thread. >_<

I disagree. It is your fault when you send any email to an unintended address.

The vast majority of replies are intended to be sent to the list.
Reply-To makes this the default action on clicking Reply in most email
clients. Thus Reply-To is correctly configured and should not be
changed for this list.

And this debate is nearly as old as mailing lists themselves.  We
might as well begin arguing the relative merits of vi versus Emacs
(forget XEmacs. Splitters!), as we're just as likely to come to a
reasonable, friendly conclusion as with discussing this particular
subject.

*grin*

PS: vi r00lz, Emacs dr00lz.

No worries. I've summarized points made in this thread and added a
little advice at

Back in the olden days before URIs were invented, people used to go on IRC
and email and talk about something they'd seen in the massive, huge maze
that was the world wide web. 

Because many times people had no idea exactly what tiny bit of the huge www
it was that someone was referring to, they invented something called a URI,
and it looks something like this: http://cnn.com/

With this URI, it became possible for people to add a _link_ to an email or
IRC message so that people receiving the message would know WTF the OP was
referring to, and see it for themselves.

I can't replicate that but there's a sniff of a grain of truth about it. 
I can bring up an SQL error in 2.3 using similar code but I can't 
replicate it using trunk.

I can't find what you're talking about on Security Focus by searching
for "Wordpress". Could you be more specific and give us an actual link
to it?

I'm happy to know you never made amistake and forgot to paste the uri
at the end of the post... It'nice to know we have little gods in this
list!

Anyway if i say the words: securityfocus, today SQL injection and
wordpress i suppose that you know there is seach function and google,
yahe someone invented them, so it's easy to find info even if someone
made a mistake!

I can bring up an SQL error in 2.3 when I use an invalid post ID
number, but I can do that without any of the extra crap.
http://example.com/blog/?feed=rss2&p=1 (where 1 is not a valid post ID
number) gives an SQL error because the comments feed is trying to get
comments for the first post in the returned post array. Since there
isn't any returned post, it errors out with invalid SQL.

But I can't get p=whatever to inject into the post ID field. What's
more, you wouldn't expect to do so, because the p parameter is forced
to an int. query.php line 449: $qv['p'] =  (int) $qv['p'];

I can't see any way for this to work. All his extra added code there
gets removed before it uses it in any SQL.

Agreed. The option to disable it completely must remain, because it
still messes with things, even in the code view.

My opinion is that TinyMCE should be removed from the core entirely,
and into a plugin instead. It can be a default packaged plugin if you
like, but making it a plugin would make it easier for other plugins to
replace the editor. Competition breeds improvement, and TinyMCE in
WordPress is in desperate need of improvement.

What are the difficulties currently in replacing it? Bug reports?

Actually, one is a matter of preference (and much debate) whereas the other
is just common courtesy, no two ways about it.

The description at
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/484608/30/0/threaded really doesn't
help. Maybe someone should explain this a little more and actually see
whether you can replicate it. The post on SecurityFocus about it is really
shit.

I agree as well. It not only messes up with what Otto said above here, 
but people are still having alot of issues in general with pasting in 
crappy stuff while writing their posts...

I agree with this as well. IMHO: Just take out the bulk. Make it a 
plugin; add the download link on the Codex plugin page, or, package it 
as default plugin. However, I'd rather see it gone from the WordPress 
zips... I never use it, and I disable it for most I install for too. I'd 
rather by default, to just upload only the most important stuff for 
WordPress to get it running and working right. Not the RTE junk... =P 
That's just me though so.. lol. Is there something smaller and perhaps 
easier to use out there RTE Wise? Or...?

Message-ID: <9a00fa1b0712051453v4d6955fepcb88df37a04af740@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I' m no coder, but I had to make a hack to get wordpress widgets drag
and drop working on my enviroment.

At first I thought my blog was broken, maybe by a plugin or upgrade.
Then, while in the US in vacation, it started workihng again. When I
came back drag and drop got messed again and I noticed that it also
happened with wordpress.com blogs.

After a lot of searching, backups, reinstalling, #wordpress, etc...
I've found the problem and I was able to fix it (I hope without
creating further problems)...

Right now I' m working in Tunisia, and all Internet traffic pass by a
transparent proxy that blocks all kind of content considered to be
inappropriate by the government. We can' t see the proxy, it's not
browser configured, it is at country's backbone.

Probably there is a misconfiguration somewhere, and when my browser
tries to load interface.js on the url:

http://www.camelomanco.com/blog/wp-includes/js/jquery/interface.js?ver=1.2

It gets the 404 error.

If I try:

http://www.camelomanco.com/blog/wp-includes/js/jquery/interface.js

It shows properly the interface.js sourcefile.

So I make a little editing on script-loader.php, on line 77:

from:
		$this->add( 'interface', '/wp-includes/js/jquery/interface.js',
array('jquery'), '1.2');

to

		$this->add( 'interface', '/wp-includes/js/jquery/interface.js',
array('jquery'), '');

The url it loads now is:

http://www.camelomanco.com/blog/wp-includes/js/jquery/interface.js?ver=6124

and since the proxy does not block it,  I got drag and drop working again.

Do you think this "hack" will create me problems elsewhere?

The version number is simply there so that when/if a new version of the file
comes out with a new version of WordPress, your browser won't use the old,
cached version.

Simply put, you shouldn't encounter any problems whatsoever. :)

I am from ghana where we use recharge vouchers for our cell phones. u buy the

they are usually about 13-15 digits long. i have noticed that with
consecutive cards the first 8 or so digits are the same. i was wondering if
with the serial numbers and recharege codes, iot would be possible to

Are there any particular bugs in Trac you'd like to see get higher 
priority, or that should be communicated upstream to the TinyMCE guys?

I've tried with the example's url, including after urlencoding and
rawurlencoding it. The best I get is a WP database error
(http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5185). Which is arguably not good, since
the error comes from the translation of ' characters to their html entity
equivalent. But not worth being alarmed from as far as I can tell.

I'm curious to know the security folks' opinion on this though. Is this a
false alarm? Or are we going to have a 2.3.2 release in the next couple
days?

It would be nice to get rid of TinyMCE's invalid markup, as noted in

Major pain? The button is only about 2 centimetres to the right.

And as for getting the email twice, good point, although I know that
Gmail properly merges the emails.

It's not making it the "default action", it's simply mangling the
functionality of the Reply button. You're making the functionality of
the Reply and Reply All buttons the same, when they were previously
different.

You're not adding any functionality, you're only removing it, and
introducing an extra hurdle when you want to specifically reply
off-list.

I was considering setting up a special email address like a few other
people do here, like "wordpress(at)jeremy.visser.name", and set up a
Reply-To header so any offlist replies would go to my main address,
"jeremy.visser(at)gmail.com", but I can't do that, because the mailing
list is completely disregarding the address I would like people to reply
to, and substituting it with its own.

But then again, it may be even more dangerous to change the function of
an already working list, as not everybody will start hitting Reply All
magically if you turn off Reply-To munging.

Not at the bottom of the email, where I usually am after reading an email.
I'm not sure about you, but I tend to read emails top-to-bottom. ;)

I agree with Andy. I don't find this to be a problem at all -- 99% of the
messages are meant to be sent to the entire list. If you really wanted to
talk to someone off-list, you could change the To address to their personal
email. This is different than, say, the wp-pro list, where you're supposed
to reply off-list. People have replied to the entire list before, by
accident, and that's a list where such a fix may be more useful.

I've found it rather frustrating with mailing lists that reply to the 
sender and not to the entire list (although, it did save my ass a couple 
of times with mail I should rather not have sent in the first place). 
You would forget that when you hit reply, it will send to the person, so 
it loses context when you don't address the person and instead address 
the group. The person receiving the email would be confused as that 
person is an individual and not multiple people. Then after you realize 
the mistake you have to resend to the mailing list.

I rather view mailing lists as an (early) extension of forums. On a web 
forum, when you hit reply, you are not replying to the individual, you 
are replying to the group and the group can join in with the discussion. 
If you wanted to reply to the person, you would send a private message 
(or in this case, an email to the individual). You are in essence 
continuing the thread when you click reply and while it is an 
inconvenience, as with online forums, it does make more sense.

To be honest, I would rather have not replied to this thread as it won't 
make any difference what we think.

PS: I do also like the feature where it blocks all emails from addresses 
not part of the list, not only did it save my ass plenty of times, it 
kept my private and personal email address from being harvested. 
Sometimes other people say what I'm thinking better than I can.

Agreed, But, I do wish it would send a bounce notification, The number of times i've not realised i've used the wrong email until later that day is countless.

At the same time.. that'd probalby dramatically increase email levels for automattic due to spam bots... so maybe bouncing isnt a good idea :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP Includes Plugin API is still broken
Message-ID: <4757837E.3070104@santosj.name>

Several patches were submitted that fixed the bugs that came up with the 
refactoring a while back. However, none of the patches were applied for 
whatever reason. If the reason for why the patches were rejected are 
given, then a new patch can be made to correct the problems with the 
Plugin API.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5225 - fixes @since information and 
brings the short description in line with the coding standards.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5163 - fixes filter documentation, 
simple patch. Patch might not still apply.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5338 - Applies what is in #5225 and 
#5163, as well as fix several issues with the current Plugin API code. 
Patch should still apply, but I can update the patch if needed.

The trac ticket 5338 is misleading, what is stated in the description is 
not followed through and only the fixes above as well as minor 
performance improvements are applied. It was found that several of the 
theories, were in practice, debunked. I still think that the patch in 
5338 should be applied to correct the current issues with merge filters, 
as well as close out two other tickets.

If that is unacceptable, then I can split up the patch and submit the 
parts to the respective tickets. I would just have rather not do so. The 
second question is whether the short description needs to be fixed at 
all. I do not feel that plugins.php is ready with the current mistakes.

Oh yes, there isn't a ticket (for such a trivial issue), but during the 
reverting of the refactoring for wp_actions, the $wp_actions global that 
was unset in wp-settings.php was not removed along with those in 
plugins.php. It would be better to remove the variable as it is no 
longer used.

Speaking of spam prevention, in case anyone is using the Bad Behavior plugin
and hasn't seen this yet...

http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/2007/12/06/bad-behavior-2011/

I got bit by this one today. Upgrading to 2.0.11 to fixes the issue.

In the interest of ending this thread, let me just say that sometimes
I wish the Reply-To contained a no-reply address. That way we wouldn't
be able to reply without first revving our brains up to the level
necessary to type in the list address and we would be spared so many
messages originated from below that level.

Love always,
Andy

p.s. Please don't reply to this message. A thousand people don't need

I have not searched through Trac in particular (partially because I
get a "no route to host" on trac.wordpress.org at my workplace for
some odd reason, but mostly because I'm lazy).

However, the support forums are rife with TinyMCE related problems.
Basically, if you try to do anything more with it than text + anchor
links + img tags, you can be virtually certain that it will screw it
up somehow. It just completely screws with your carefully crafted HTML
code; there's a dozen or so cases of people entering in stuff in the
"code" tab, then going to edit the post, TinyMCE popping up and
ruining all that hard work instantly. The only real workable solution,
if you actually want to enter HTML snippets, is to disable the visual
editor entirely.

Example: Go to any site that gives you embeddable code to paste (ie,
Youtube) and try it with the TinyMCE editor. The result is invariably
chaos, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria. It has a
particular problem with object tags, putting the params outside the
object and sometimes removing them entirely for no obvious reason.

wpautop doesn't much help either in that respect, although I'd rather
see that improved rather than removed. At least autop has gotten
noticably better over time. TinyMCE has gotten noticably worse.
Perhaps the developers don't actually use the visual editor much? I
don't either, so I wouldn't blame them for it, but that would explain
it's lack of improvement.

Debugging javascript stuff like this is really not my bag, else I'd
try to fix some bugs and submit some patches for it.

-Otto

How about a check that looks through content submitted viacode view,

if it notices known T.MCE issues either give a warning and/or (idealy) an
option to disable rich editing until the post is published and/or
(super-idealy) setting it as a default setting for this post/page. Me
thinks would make WordPress much more viable as a CMS and take it a step
beyond the competition. ( I may be wrong about this but I haven't noticed
nearly as manny issues with T.MCE in e.g. Joomla (it is T.MCE in there
isn't it?) so I don't think the issues relate *just* to T.MCE )

- and probably do something similar before a post is opened via T.MCE

I once more refer everyone on this list to the best (IMHO....) TinyMCE
alternative out there: Xinha.

Only shame is no Opera support, but it's _beautiful_ (code and looks),
_light_, and standards-compatible. 

WordPress plugin already exists:
http://plugins.baptiste.us/plugins/xinha4wp/

I write posts in WLW now, but in the past Xinha has served me well. I'm
currently using it for the commenting interface on my site, and my readers
seem to like it as well :)

You can see it in action at
http://neosmart.net/blog/2007/vistas-purple-screen-of-death/ (works in IE6+
and all FF).

I was just caught with that issue (being flagged as a spammer) last 
night as well. I emailed Michael directly and he pointed me to that 
post. I didn't think there was an update, I checked through my control 
panel and found nothing... I guess I'll have to keep my eyes peeled for 
future updates on his site then...

Aha!  And here I thought it was our WPhone plugin causing me to be

I don't think he uses the official plugin repo, so you wouldn't see a

I agree with this entirely.

However -- if we were to do this, I think it would behoove us to  
establish certain things in core so that all such Editor Plugins can  
interact the same way with core _and_ other plugins.  In other words,  
establish either some sort of core hooks for these interfaces to  
attach themselves to, and/or at least standardize function names (and  
parameters) these plugins should use for certain things so that other  
plugins can interact with them.

Example:  We establish that Editor Plugins can allow other plugins to  
add buttons by defining a function like so:  add_WYS_button 
( button_name, function, image )

The actual handling of that function is within each Editor Plugin,  
but any other plugin authors would be able to call it, and it would  
work with _any_ editor function that includes that standardized  
function call.

Message-ID: <5EF54E8C-B8AB-467B-A152-CECED5EB1A3A@birdhouse.org>

The user experience of landing on a Codex page for a deprecated  
function is lousy.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_links

"This function has been deprecated. That means it has been replaced by  
a new function or is no longer supported, and may be removed from  
future versions. All code that uses this function should be converted  
to use its replacement if one exists."

OK, so what function should you use instead? No hint whatsoever on  
that page. So  you turn to the "Related" section at the bottom of the  
page hoping to find a similar function that's not deprecated. But nope  
- each of these:

  get_links_list,  wp_get_links,  get_links,  wp_get_linksbyname,   
get_linksbyname

has the same "I'm stuck in a hole with nowhere to turn" message as  
above, no hint as to what to use instead. I think the Codex can do  
better. I'd be happy to do some editing in the Codex to fix this, IF I  
had a reliable list of all deprecated functions and their  
replacements. Is there one?

Have you already looked at wp-includes/deprecated.php ?

I looked over the deprecated file, but I didn't see any mention of what
function to use instead in the comments.

I see a large number of the functions preceded with a comment that tells
exactly that.  Unfortunately not all functions have such a comment.

E.g. lines 21, 46, 80, 101, 123, 309, 438, 456, 462, 471, 477, 482 and 487.

sorry for the delay, I just got around to verifying this.

Okay, so here's my layout:

3 total categories, with IDs 9, 10, and 11. 9 and 10 are siblings, and
11 is a sub category to 10. Category 10 has no posts, and category 11
has 1 post. if I do get_posts('category=11'), I see that 1 post. if I
do get_posts('category=10') I still see that one post. This is clearly
wrong.

This also happens if I view the categories: ie, if I browse to
site.com/?cat=11 I see the 1 post like I'm supposed, but if I go to
site.com/?cat=10 I still see that post.

this seems like a bug to me, if I wanted sub categories I'd ask for them.

You are correct, it would be good if the new function to use was 
indicated. Some of the deprecated functions in the codex have been 
marked with this, and some haven't. If you figure out which function 
should be used, please edit the codex page and add that to the 
documentation.

You can also mark the page as "in need of editing" in the codex, and 
put a "talk" item explaining it needs a reference to the new function 
to use.

The Codex is a continual "work in progress" and a volunteer effort. I 
believe it is improving, but it can improve faster if you help. By the 
way, the "docs" mailing list is the correct venue for this discussion, 
not "hackers".

Thanks,
     Jennifer

Okay, I'm confused. Are you using get_posts or not?

>From looking at the code, I don't think get_posts will return children.
However, query_posts will indeed do just that.

So your links with cat=11 and cat=10 will indeed behave the way you're
saying, but I can't see how get_posts() will do what you're talking
about. If you say it is, then it is, but I can't see how it could.

Maybe if you turned on query logging and logged the actual SQL that
occurs on your get_posts() call, we could figure it out.

Well, for this particular case, the replacement functions are as follows:
get_bookmark <- Gets a single bookmark given an ID
get_bookmarks <- Gets an array of bookmarks based on various things
wp_list_bookmarks <- Displays (or returns) the bookmarks in various ways

I've corrected the codex so that these have related bits that will
point to the proper places for these functions (only documentation
currently exists for the wp_list_bookmarks though, the other two need
to be added).

yes, I am using get_posts:

$p = get_posts('category=10'); echo $p[0]->post_title;

I have no idea how get_posts is doing this, but it definitely is. How
can I turn on query logging?

Add define('SAVEQUERIES', true); to your wp-config.php file.

Then somewhere in your theme, you can dump the queries to the output.
Like add this to the footer.php file:
<?php echo "<!--\n"; var_dump($wpdb->queries); echo "\n-->"; ?>

Then load the page showing the problem, view source, and all the SQL
you ran will be at the bottom of the page.

Remove the SAVEQUERIES afterwards, it's a bit of a performance hit to
leave it on.

Message-ID: <B213003D-67F6-4B5D-B70F-AEC1E06BE591@pixline.net>

Hi all, I've a question I can't find answer even by browsing trac  
code, and I hope someone of you can help, because I'm getting crazy :-)

I'm trying to make the Gengo plugin compatible with WP2.3+ , and this  
means rewriting all category-related stuff against the new API.
The original plugin shipped with those actions:

				// Categories.
				add_action('add_category', array(& $this, 'add_category'));
				add_action('delete_category', array(& $this, 'delete_category'));

It actually can't do anything, and browsing WordPress code I can't  
even find those action. So I supposed they've gone with the 2.3  
family, and I've found this changeset:

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5528

It seems that some actions died in this changeset (like those in admin- 
db.php - the removed part of it - lines #147/161)

Am I wrong, and they're just somewhere I can't reach, or maybe those  
actions aren't actually working?
If so, I'll need to find another way to notify the plugin when a  
category is modified in any way...

Thank you!

It seems that add_category hook was renamed to create_category [1] --
delete_category[2] has not changed.

[1] http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/taxonomy.php#L1092
[2] http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/taxonomy.php#L943

I definitively have to learn better how to use trac :-) I didn't  
considered at all that an action could have a name change...
Thank you!

Thinking of the most (99.9%?) users that can't/won't code html by hand 
and their surprise when they see a plain textarea instead of an editor...

TinyMCE has pretty good cleanup functions considering the alternatives, 
and large part of wpautop is in there too (in the "wordpress" plugin). 
It is HTML 4.01 Transitional by default, but that can be changed to 
almost XHTML 1.0 by adding "inline_styles : true" to the config.

Also their version 3.0 that has lots of improvements seems to be coming 
along well and probably will make it into WordPress in the second half 
of next year.

It's also pretty easy to disable it too: just add 
wp_deregister_script('wp_tiny_mce'); and it's gone.

Just curious, but can't "you" just make Akismet part of the core? Like, 
take it out of the plugins directory all together, and add it to core? 
Make a special file for that itself? Or, since Spam Karma 2 has an 
Akismet plugin option, just add Spam Karma 2 instead? I was just 
wondering since Akismet is also the Developers little baby too. =) As 
for "Hello Dolly" plugin, maybe just make that part of core as well? 
Just maybe make option some where in the control panel to turn it off or 
on. Rather then have it a plugin sitting in the plugins section. I don't 
use it, but when running SVN, if you'd remove it.. it will automatically 
come back again when doing "svn up"...  Just throwing out random 
thoughts here...

+1 for making Akismet part of the core and perhaps enabling it when 
valid API key is entered.

This is a solid argument _against_ making it a plugin.  I had also  
not realized now easy it was to entirely disable TinyMCE if making an  
"alternate" plugin.  I still think it's a good idea to standardize  
how such Editor plugins might interact with core so other plugins  
might work with whatever editor is active -- though if TinyMCE is  
already there, I suppose that whatever it's functions are become the  
de facto standard.  Hmmm...

has there been any real discussion of standardizing the ability for  
plugins to add editor buttons?  Will the upcoming version of TinyMCE  
have this?

Snark aside, one of the primary purposes of "Hello Dolly" is to serve  
as an example of how to make a plugin, and to give n00bs an idea of  
the kind of things that plugins can do.

-1 on this.

Unless it's "on" be default there's no reason for it to be in core  
(it needs to be "activated" regardless), and reasons for it _not_ to  
be (clutters up options if you don't use it).

Yeah, and making updates for "it" wouldn't be any less painful than 
making normal core file updates anyway...

Oh of course! "It" is an example for nOObs to build plugins off of or 
whatever. I'm just saying, basically MOST probably don't even use it, 
and with it being "small" it might be better to just slap it in core or 
maybe remove it all together and add the file itself to the Codex under 
"example for building plugins" or something... Sorry, I'm just one of 
those people that don't like having extra unused plugins in the plugin 
directory.. LOL! *cough * I'm a bit lazy too, I could delete it each 
time I "svn up" but I'd have to keep deleting it again and again and 
again... Wheew.. I'm getting tired thinking about that...

That's true too. But I also mentioned about Spam Karma 2 + Akismet 
option. Maybe make that a default plugin or something. Even if you'd add 
that as a prepackaged plugin, the Akismet option would be activated or 
not, via the Spam Karma 2 options section...

I see it as; Either way you look at it, there is going to be anti-spam 
prevention plugin(s) NEEDED for people. I know Akismet is the developers 
baby too. The Akismet file itself is good to have, don't get me wrong. 
But when I run Spam Karma 2 + Akismet, I don't usually use the normal 
default Akismet plugin itself. Why bother? Instead, Spam Karma 2 + 
Akismet is a "two in one" deal.

Could this still be potentially dangerous with the .. modifier?
Basically this will allow them to execute any PHP file on your server
in your context, no? Might be an issue with shared servers.

Otto, I've already tried the ../ trick and thankfully there is
protection against this. It does only allows you to include files
within the wp-content/plugins directory.

Just wondering though, couldn't it be "on" by default, then have an 
option some where to turn it "off" when needed as well? I mean, that's 
what is done with the RTE right? Maybe just add this to the User section 
as well, right around the RTE enabling stuff. User can tick it "off" or 
"on" at their desire. Most users now know to have their key for it 
anyway. And if they don't remember it or whatever, just add some text 
for a reminder that's linked to the proper place for it...

*sigh*

This is exactly what the "Replace With" heading was added for, an 
example of which is:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_category_head#Replace_With

As Jennifer noted, it would have been nice if these had been marked as 
"in need of editing." Se la wiki...

Over the next day I'll see about making sure all *newer* deprecated 
functions are so listed with correct replacement info.

Cheers,

Totally -1 on this. There are very legitimate reasons for some folks not to use Akismet. There also is the API key requirement which unnecessarily promotes Automattic (no offense, guys). Plus its code that's just best left in plugin territory.

Just curious, but can't "you" just make Akismet part of the core? Like, 
take it out of the plugins directory all together, and add it to core? 
Make a special file for that itself? Or, since Spam Karma 2 has an 
Akismet plugin option, just add Spam Karma 2 instead? I was just 
wondering since Akismet is also the Developers little baby too. =) As 
for "Hello Dolly" plugin, maybe just make that part of core as well? 
Just maybe make option some where in the control panel to turn it off or 
on. Rather then have it a plugin sitting in the plugins section. I don't 
use it, but when running SVN, if you'd remove it.. it will automatically 
come back again when doing "svn up"...  Just throwing out random 
thoughts here...

The original suggestion to make it part of core wasn't even remotely
serious, just an attempted reductio on the "TinyMCE is important and
useful to a lot of people, so it should be in core" argument.

Yes, TinyMCE 3.0-beta has this:
tinymce.PluginManager.load('myplugin', 
'/some/dir/someplugin/editor_plugin.js');
tinymce.PluginManager.requireLangPack('myplugin');
Not sure if/how it can go in tiny_mce_gzip.php (would be nice).

In the current version external plugins can be loaded with:
tinyMCE.loadPlugin("myplugin","/some/dir/myplugin");
but it may have a problem loading the language file if different from "en".

No, I was throwing thoughts out on a serious note. I think I seen some 
where in someones thread about other plugins and I just added my 
thoughts on Akismet in here. I should have started a new thread 
discussion on "it". My bad.

I can agree with you on this. That's kind of why I threw out the idea on 
Spam Karma 2 + Akismet too. Rather then just having Akismet itself, why 
not prepackage a "two in one" deal or something? Most users are going to 
want and need an anti-spam plugin anyway! And most I'm sure grab all 
three main anti-spam plugins anyway. And most I'm sure also do that Spam 
Karma + Akismet as well. I know I do it. I know Viper007Bond does it 
too. That's where I got it from before. I just threw out the whole idea 
for Akismet being added to the core, to make it simpler. Rather than 
having those plugins in the plugin folder, make it easier by slapping it 
in core... I don't see it as self promotion per se, I see it as a FREE 
anti-spam plugin that comes with WordPress regardless of where it is in 
the folder structure or whatever else.

It's okay. ;) I can see how one would think that, because I DO usually 
add alot of sarcasm with my posts. That's just me and my style though...

As for the whole TinyMCE discussion, I think I pretty much said what I 
wanted to say:

a) Take it out.
b) If you're not going to take it out, do something to make it even 
better. (I'm not sure what though, because I'm not a coder and such. I 
just see it as being unused bulk, and troublesome. Especially with nOObs 
to "it" in general.)
c) Perhaps something smaller and different would be better? (Not sure 
about this though. But whatever else you'd want to try out would need to 
be compat with various browsers, not just a select few browsers.)

-1.  Akismet is not free, so I don't use it.  I even deleted the folder 
(along with hello.php).  I wouldn't want it to be part of the core, where it 
would waste memory and time even if I don't use it.  I need WordPress to be 
faster, not slower.

-1 on this.

Unless it's "on" be default there's no reason for it to be in core
(it needs to be "activated" regardless), and reasons for it _not_ to
be (clutters up options if you don't use it).

Wait, not free? I don't remember paying anything for it... Or am I 
missing something here? I haven't had booze or anything for near two 
years now, so I know for sure I wasn't drunk and shelled out money for 
"it".

I didn't notice my blog being slower because of "it". I can't delete 
those things because I'm on SVN. Even IF I did delete it, it would come 
back again when I went to do a "svn up"... so, it just sits there sigh. 
But yeah, I don't notice the blog being slower because of "it".. :P

If you make over $500 from your blog (something many, many WP blogs do) its not free. As I said in my email awhile ago - there are very legit reasons why some WP users would not want to use Akismet. And on by default with no WP.com api key will present a constant nag message.

Note also that in the context of deciding whether something should be
included in a GPL software package Akismet is also non-free insofar as
it is a closed system and thus not Free Software/Open Source .

Even though the plugin itself is GPL (i think) putting Akismet
directly into WP would be a bit of a slag to the  hardcore Free
Software people who would rather run their own setup completely using
open code. Not sure if that's what bob was getting at, but it's
another valid reason to both consider Akismet not free and to keep
Akismet out of core Wordpress.

p.s. I <3 and use Akismet.

See http://akismet.com/buy/non-profit/
And our organization doesn't qualify for the half-price or free options.  We 
have to pay full price, which is $50/month or $550/year.

As far as it being slower, if it was part of the core and loaded every time 
someone looked at the blog, the blog would be slower.  As a plugin, I can 
delete it and never even have to think about it.

[rant] Note that big non-profits that pay their executives 6-figure salaries 
get to use Akismet for free.  But a small _volunteer_ group, on a shoestring 
budget, like ours has to pay $550/year for Akismet. [/rant]

Why don't you just use the Registry Pattern[1]? Which is what you did, but
I would hate you forever if I seen that code in production.

Usually, globals introduced in code have the possibility of clashing with
other globals in the same or another environment. Granted, it is unlikely
someone will name their global variable $wp_filters (if they enjoyed
living), but you'll never know.

With an Registry pattern a fool would have to go out of their way to mess
with your code and so you can assume it was on purpose (then the hate
could be brought down upon the poor soul).

I think what your code does is a more hackish attempt at the Registry
Pattern.

A couple of problems with your code.

1. $g is a copy, therefore unsetting it will have no effect whatsoever on
the original $GLOBALS array. <?php unset($GLOBALS[$g]); ?>

2. Anything that uses variable variables needs to be rewritten to not be
variable variables (in production code).

3. The performance hit that would be your code would be massive, depending
on two factors. A) How many globals there are and B) how many functions
actually use your method. Not to mention eval() is slow.

4. You would in effect make all globals available to your function and
have an even greater chance of clashes, negating the entire advantage of
explicitly declaring which globals you want available in function local
scope.

5. I'm not exactly sure you can use variable variables with super globals
(*wonders if $GLOBALS is actually a super global*). However did you test
your code? If so, then I learned something new today.

After some contemplation, I realized you were kidding. Coincidently, I was
likewise kidding in my original post.

After some further contemplation, I realized that this (#5) is incorrect.
You should be able to do what you did in your code.

Okay, I didn't actually submit a patch, but a mock up is in one of my
comments.

I also realized that you are in fact the author (I would guess) of the
ticket, which then means you are, sarcastically, trying to motivate
support for the ticket.

Once I realized that, before I first hit the submit button in the first
email, it appears quite humorous, but I couldn't help but point out the
mistakes.

While we're at it, why don't we just include every plugin in the
wordpress.org plugin repository? It's not like people need a choice of what
functionality they use. I mean, more is better, right?

Maybe that should be in the message about it being deprecated, as well?

I'm seriously feel like documenting the code more. I think that file 
will be the first one I tap. I didn't realize it in the first round, but 
the codex would be seriously useful. I think after the entire source 
code is documented it should obsolete that in the codex and a WordPress 
phpDocumentor site should be set up instead to do the low level 
documentation.

I was actually hoping to steal ("borrow") the theme used on 
wordpress.org for a phpDocumentor layout. It would be damn sexy. Damn 
sexy indeed.

Also, does this mean that any deprecated functions should be moved to 
that file regardless of where it was before?

The great thing about a wiki--if you don't like it and think it could
be better then change it.  The community will flush it out.
Democratic knowledge retention!

No, because once it's edited and the appropriate info provided it 
doesn't need that message any longer...

That's not really a fair point. WordPress also includes the ability to
talk POP3 to mail servers, many of which are non-free but we don't
believe this makes WordPress any less free.

I'm not that familiar with Akismet and it's plugin but I presume that
the plugin itself is enough documentation to implement a GPL 'Akismet'
server if you wished.

We're really way off point here but your analogy is not really fair.  
WordPress doesn't include POP3 in its code (POP3 is a protocol anyway)  
and it doesn't include mail servers (free or not free). So how exactly  
can you make this comparison to Akismet which is actual code?

There's a POP3 client in wp-includes/class-pop3.php.

POP3 client is not a POP3 server and isn't even the same codebase - so  
you still can't use the "some pop servers are not free" argument.

Following some discussion off-list there seems to be confusion regarding
the licensing of the Akismet plugin. http://akismet.com/development/ and
 a presence at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/ would seem to
indicate that it's licensed under some form of GPL although it's never
explicitly clear.

I've filled in the form at http://akismet.com/contact/ requesting that
the situation be made explicit in the code.

That's not really clear. Gnu? 1,2,3? LGPL? AGPL? What if you obtained it
from another source? (my first point of call wasn't akismet.com but
wordpress.org/extend/plugins/)

Hackers! Has this thread gone so far off-topic only because nobody has
the ability or desire to write code? Back to the original question:

It would be possible with some work. The tabs we now have were the
product of much hair-pulling by me a while ago and the experience was
not so much fun that I contain a burning desire to make it work as you
propose. Of course, I would love it if it worked that way.

For the person who takes this as a challenge (as I meant it) I will
answer technical question on or off this list.

Lmao. Yeah right. See, that creates more work then just manually 
deleting it.

a) I'd have to actually learn PHP coding. With my busy time schedule 
currently, it would take a year or more.
b) Yawn. Just no motivation.
c) I'm starting to nod off thinking about it all.

Hello list. I'm a long time viewer, but not much of a participator.

I was wondering if there is any chance of beeing able to paste images
directly into the the editor in the future, or is it a browser limitation?

I've tested with two editors (TinyMCE and ***Dean's FCKEditor For
Wordpress
<http://www.deanlee.cn/wordpress/fckeditor-for-wordpress-plugin/>*), and
three browsers (IE, Opera and Firefox). The closest I came to getting a
result is this with Firefox and FCKEditor:

<p><img alt=""
src="file:///C:/DOCUME~1/KENT~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot-13.jpg" /></p>

I'd like to just edit a picture in Photoshop and then copy a section of
that picture straight into a post without creating a file and uploading
it. Is it technically possible or do I have to use an external program
for it?

Although this isn't what you had in mind, and until this sort of
functionality gets addressed it does get rid of the need of having to create
a new file every time:

   - Paste the image into the editor
   - Copy the image source location
   (file:///C:/DOCUME~1/KENT~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot-13.jpg)
   - Paste it into the upload text field (the box next to "browse"), and
   hit upload
   - It uploads the image that was in your clipboard.

Functionality that would enable this feature natively would be awesome, but
I have a feeling it wont be happening for a while, but post a ticket to trac
and see what happens :)

I'm thinking that this is some of the off-topic content Andy was referring
to. That and about 20 other messages.

Oooh! Superb!

I thought I did check that file earlier to find out it didn't exist. But
now it did! Thanks! :)

The newer versions require PHP5 as support was dropped for PHP4 some 
time ago. Since the codex is running PHP 4.4.2, they would have to 
upgrade PHP to the latest of PHP 5 (5.2.5).

So I mean the request should be that the upgrade PHP to PHP 5.2.5 and 
MediaWiki to the latest.

Updating PHP is not hard at all and updating MediaWiki is even easier,
although I think that the Wiki the Codex uses currently needs to be
drastically re-thought, it is useless and the search is crap. You even find
pages that have not been created while searching. Hence why I never use the
Codex for help, it is useless! Needs to be re-thought in my opinion.

Would you help with a WordPress DocBook? I think the reason several 
things are difficult to find are because they aren't indexed. I'm not 
sure about the author's copyright on information written for the codex, 
but if someone wrote it in a DocBook style format, it might go far to 
further educate those who are new to WordPress. Interesting yes, but it 
would be quite a long and extremely time consuming process. Even though 
most of the information is probably on the codex now.

I think the best part of a DocBook, is that you can have versions for 
each WordPress that is released. It isn't like you are going to have to 
rewrite the entire book for each new release, just add and revise parts. 
The difference between the wiki and docbook, is that you can keep the 
versions visible. I think it would be nice, but I'm not planning to 
start it and while it would be nice for end users, I'm not an end user 
and luckily, WordPress is easy enough to pick up through plain usage.

As for the Wiki? I wouldn't be able to find anything better that could 
replace it.

Just pretty much throwing the docbook idea out there.

Just wanted to emphasize this last point! It's really annoying, doing a 
search in the codex and getting empty pages ("This page has no content 
yet." or something like that) as half of the search results.

The Codex is really not that bad. About 90% of support request on
#wordpress are redirected to a Codex page.

And the search function is fine... if you use Google to search in it :)

I have no objection to the technology being used (indeed, I much prefer it
to the forums). The search may well get better if the site was upgraded to a
recent version.

If the search fails in a recent version of Mediawiki then by all means
replace or supplement it with Google Search.

Cheers, M.

For exact word matches, yeah, but it's horrible if you spelled something
wrong. Google corrects for this -- maybe the Codex should go through Google?

It's not really the fact of JUST the PHP version, it's also the fact 
that the bbPress forum/ Codex login integration stuff won't work with a 
MediaWiki version too much higher then what's already there. I'm sure it 
could be handled ("fixed/applied") though, but it's gonna take some work 
on "their" part... But I could be wrong though too. =/

Subject: [wp-hackers] Bug Rot
Message-ID: <475B6A22.6000904@santosj.name>

Well, on second thought, this really should be posted to WP-Testers to 
test whether the bugs still exist, but a lot of the bugs need patches.

Going over the bugs, it appears that some of them are for features that 
will probably never become part of WordPress or have been opened for so 
long that it is a wonder if anyone cares.

WordPress 2.4 has 589 opened tickets (at the moment), WordPress 2.5 has 
135, with a total of 724 tickets. There should not be a wonder why some 
people have asked that there be a release of just bug fixes. While it 
would be a good idea, it really should not happen because end users care 
not and would be unmotivated to upgrade for what would seem to be 
trivial. "Come download, this release has over 400 closed tickets."

Over the history, 2.1 closed the most tickets with 469. 2.2 had 240 
tickets, finally 2.3.0 had 351. 2.4 is due in two months and currently 
only has 89 tickets closed. It might be possible, but since most of the 
bugs are of general and administration nature, it might be safe to say 
that with the new administration theme/panel some of the bugs might be 
able to be closed out. Then again perhaps not.

The point I'm trying to make, is if a bug is open for over 6 months 
without any traction, what does this mean? As the unit tests grow and 
documentation improves, it can be safe to say that a lot of the bugs 
will be found and smashed before it gets out there in the wild. However, 
with any new code (taxonomy, improvements to plugin api), there are 
bound to be obscure issues that will come up only through manual 
testing, and even then it might be difficult to reproduce those bugs. 
The problem then is how do you know you are reproducing it correctly? 
Should I go with what I see and decide it isn't an issue and wait for 
the reporter to reopen?

Ah, but it might be a while before the entirely of WordPress is Unit 
Tested, how many people care? If you love to code, then unit testing 
would be heaven. Think about it. What more fun can you get out of coding 
than writing code that tests code! Eh. I fall victim myself, should I 
write unit tests or no? Well, WordPress doesn't require it and it is 
really adds about 20 to an hour more. Plus, hell what if you find a 
mistake, you have to go back and fix your code and who wants all that 
trouble?

It would be nice if every bug had a patch, but looking through the bugs, 
not many of them are sexy. XML-RPC, no thank you, I choose torture 
instead. Plus, have you seen the library? No way I'm touching that, it 
looks sexy, but XML-RPC is way over my head. Alternatives are PHP 5 
only, so unlikely to be accepted by the powers that be.

In any event, it completely sucks to spend the time to write a patch and 
then have it rejected. I would very much rather not use Globals, but 
Registry Pattern. Andy (I apologize for the asshole-ness of my sarcastic 
response, I failed to realize the context of what you meant with 
"April"... I'm a dumbass), if the goal is to not use globals but a layer 
in between, then I'm all for it, hell I would totally help write that 
code in a heartbeat. It is sexy, the Registry Pattern I mean, and sexy 
like Unit Testing. What would make it even better, is if the API was 
developed using TDD!

While having a registry pattern API might help in CMS development, the 
additional layer between your variables and your code would add 
additional overhead. I understand why others wouldn't want it, 
additional complexity, additional overhead, additional work between 
variables and your code, and lack of language support (nothing quite 
beats <?php global $var_name; ?>. However, if you think about some of 
the variable names that WordPress uses, it can be easy to think how when 
other programs are introduced, how one of those programs might also use 
one of those generic termed variables.

I'll stop there. What I mean to say is that, with some of the tickets 
are feature requests that either have no work associated with them or 
work that will never be accepted. So either you run the risk of 
producing a ticket that might be extremely useful and have the author 
become uninterested with supplying a patch, or you have an idea with a 
patch that no one (except a (few) minor player(s) that don't matter 
anyway, re: no commit access and those people's opinion don't matter. 
Sad but true.)

That is entirely frustrating, because my time is valuable and I very 
much hate for my time to be wasted. Not valuable in the sense that I'm 
paid a lot for being a programmer (I'm not, but I'm more happy to have 
the title of "Web Developer" than making money), but valuable in that I 
have to choose between one project or the other. If I choose one 
project, then I can't do the other project. So I mean, I might have to 
apologize to Travis too, because that guy is right very often too.

In that case, it makes sense that you'll want the community to be nice 
to each other. Even through, I don't matter, if I make it not fun for 
another person, then that other person is unlikely to create a patch and 
provide a very good solution. That would be a shame, if not from the 
perspective of the user who enjoys improved stability, then for the 
missed opportunity to learn from another. The most important thing is to 
learn and one of the most enjoyable part of the WordPress community are 
the intelligent programmers and how much I've learned from the patches 
and those that wrote WordPress documentation.

Yeah, it would be nice if some of the older tickets had more recent 
relevance to them.

The Codex can be upgraded to MediaWiki version 1.6.10, which is the last
version with support for PHP4.

However, I'd urge Matt (or whoever) to upgrade to PHP5 since 4 is going EOL.

Sorry for the O/T post. :P

Awhile back, in June, it was posted on wp-hackers that if anybody wanted
wp-content.org, they could have it. I took them up on the offer, I was
thinking of making some sort of site on it. But, I didn't really think of a
site that would fit the domain, and don't really have anything to do with
the domain. Plus, I don't really want to renew it in a couple of months. :P

So, since I got it free from wp-hackers, I'm going to give it away free to
on wp-hackers.

If anyone wants the domain wp-content.org, send me an email (off-list, so as
to not bother anybody further). It's registered at Netfirms and expires
February 2, 2008.

Thanks,

Yeah, that's right. I couldn't think of the version off-hand before. I

I have 27 years of software engineering experience, and the thing I hate the 
most is writing test code.

Or are you being sarcastic?

Agreed.  It's not so much of a pride thing as spending a lot of time on 
something just to see it go to waste.  Especially when I've seen lead 
developers put untested patches in the trunk.

I've never been on a project with such lack of supervision in my 27 years. 
It would be nice if someone in a position of responsibility could say, "Go 
work on this, we want to put it in," so you know the work wouldn't be 
wasted.  But that doesn't happen, and it makes me wonder if I want to be 
involved further.

In that case, Would anyone like to put forward some trac tickets which they really want to get done for 2.4, but dont have the time or expertise to do so?
(a one line description or the trac title might be nice too for others to glance down and "Yeah, i can do that!")

Message-ID: <op.t217ruv6k6w4mc@dd32.no-ip.com>

A few people have probably noticed ticket #5418, removing a lot of unused variables.
No, I didnt go through a manually locate them all, I wrote up an app(PHP + token_get_all()) to alert me to certain variables which might not be used.

The result was that it threw up quite a few variables which were declared as Globals that were no longer used, and a few which were typos (Infact, i just found another one, $postition instead of $position in WP_Ajax_Response::add() ).

I'd like to make a reminder to people who arerefactoring code, or when part of a function is being deprecated to give the functions affected a quick run over to make sure you've not left any unneeded variables lying around, At times they can become confusing as to what something does until you realise that the variable your looking at doesnt affect anything.

Today i cleaned up my app and added a few extra functions into it, And in the process gave it some form of UI which is half usable.
So i now present to you, a 500KB report of all the WP functions, What version of PHP every function requires(and if theres a compat function available for it), What varables/arguements in functions that are unused, And a bit of a listing of what functions/variables each class contains (and their default value).

As you'll notice, the app. isnt fully bug free(Unknown functions contains things which ARE known, and case sensitivity is running wild throughout still).

While this message is mainly for people with interest to look through, I'd also welcome any suggestions as to what should also be included and whatnot.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <475BCA85.8020700@gmail.com>

The whole thing with past tickets keep getting bumped up to the next 
version, and then getting yet another bump to a later version is...

a) They went with a time frame release schedule. They see all those 
tickets and think "Crap, look at all that stuff there. Most of it isn't 
THAT important, let's bump it to next version." Then once starting on 
the next version, it's just a repeat of the previous one. They get 
bumped again. Before ya know it, they don't have the "time" anymore to 
apply all those "past tickets" into the current version they're working 
on. OR, most of those aren't relevant to that current version they're 
working on.

b) The whole "more is better" is also there. They want to slap in this 
and that, or this and that other thing as well. Then, they have to work 
in, or around those "past tickets" that kept getting bumped from version 
to version for those new "this and thats". Example: Happy Cog is coming 
soon. I'm sure they're racking their brains trying to figure out, what 
was applied before, what will need applied this time to have Happy Cog 
"fit" around.

c) Theres only a few SVN commit folk. Between "business" life and 
personal life, it's probably hard to just be there committing (knocking 
out) tickets 24-7, only to keep getting reports on wp-testers that those 
commits gave problems and then try and find ANOTHER work-around for it all.

d) Maybe they just don't like the patch submitter. Perhaps they don't 
like the person's personality and or their website looks crappy. "Hey, 
this guy looks, sounds, and acts like a Walmart greeter, lets not submit 
his patches... "

e) "Yawn, look at all those tickets. Hey, who wants to get drunk and 
play WoW tonight?!?!?"

f) They're not drinking the "right" alcoholic beverages.

g) They're are enough coders/submitters and not enough testers. BUT! 
I've been running Trunk for the longest time, and there hasn't been much 
WRONG in a long time. Besides, can't really "test" anything if there's 
not much committed to start with. "Wow, they committed three things 
tonight and nothing is wrong. Let's report that nothing is wrong, 
because we're bored waiting for more commits to test."

h) All those tickets SEEM simple, so lets just hold them for near 
Release date. Release date comes near, they go commit happy and it turns 
out to be more of a head-ache then they thought. Ooops! Let's rethink 
this people! Beep! Beep! Alert! Emergency mode people! Retract from 
Trunk, or pack more junk in the trunk!?

i) Who cares about all that stuff now!? It should all be committed by 
Version 10.X. And who knows, maybe 90% of it can be deleted by 2.4.X or 
2.5.

Well, there are priorities of course, but like it is with most open
source systems, people make the improvements they want and then try to
argue them into the main line code. The methodology itself is somewhat
incompatible with steering it in a specific direction because the
people doing the work are also those deciding what work it is that
needs to be done.

Don't think of it as potentially doing a lot of work that goes unused.
Make the changes that you personally want to get made and submit
those. Even if they don't get used or if they get refactored out,
you'll have those changes to use yourself.

Amazing work, DD32! I think that resources like this will increase the  
overall knowledge of WP code.
I think that would be great to have for every functions two more things:
- the file name you can find that function declared
- the file(s) where that function is called

This would be a really precious thing for developers, I think. At  
least, in the last days probably I would have use it a dozen times :-)

Bests,
p.

Ok, here's two queries that looked to be in the right section:

    string(359) "SELECT DISTINCT * FROM wp_posts ,
wp_term_relationships, wp_term_taxonomy   WHERE 1=1 AND post_type =
'post' AND post_status = 'publish'   AND (wp_posts.ID =
wp_term_relationships.object_id AND
wp_term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id =
wp_term_taxonomy.term_taxonomy_id AND wp_term_taxonomy.term_id = 10)
GROUP BY wp_posts.ID ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT 0,5"

    string(284) "SELECT t.*, tt.*, tr.object_id FROM wp_terms AS t
INNER JOIN wp_term_taxonomy AS tt ON tt.term_id = t.term_id INNER JOIN
wp_term_relationships AS tr ON tr.term_taxonomy_id =
tt.term_taxonomy_id WHERE tt.taxonomy IN ('category', 'post_tag') AND
tr.object_id IN (18) ORDER BY t.name ASC"

so it looks like the first one is trying to select those with cat =
10. I looked at the mysql tables, and I think I found the culprit:

mysql> select * from wp_term_relationships where object_id=18;
    +-----------+------------------+
    | object_id | term_taxonomy_id |
    +-----------+------------------+
    |        18 |               10 |
    |        18 |               11 |
    +-----------+------------------+

The object_id=18 is because that's the post id that's giving me
problems. So, somehow adding a post to category 11 made it also be
added to cat 10... I should note that all of the UI shows the post
only being in category 11 (for example, on the admin page when I edit
the post it shows only the one category)

Could this be because I originally had the post in category 10, but
decided it was better suited for the sub-category and moved it?
perhaps there's a bug in changing a post's categories?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Hacking of uploads.php tab in editing admin page
Message-ID: <1197234224.7166.24.camel@localhost>

Hi to all,
        in the post/page editing page, I would override uploads tab
interface. 

Instead of showing classic thumbnail y/n , link page/image radio
selector, I would show any choice and force to output lightbox stuff to
the content textarea. More, i would to re-size thumbnails to 200px.

The lightbox stuff maybe html directly or some hook like:
<!--myimg:lightboxname:titlecaption:filename.jpg--> In this case i could
assign a filter to that trigger. 

best regards

I'm not saying that the developers, testers, and bug reporters and those 
that supervise tickets aren't doing a good job. They are. Really, if 
anything the WordPress community needs more people to write unit tests, 
write documentation, manage tickets, test WordPress.

The non-sexy stuff and the stuff people forget the names of people who 
do. If every ticket had a patch, then yeah, it would be those with 
commit access. I don't think the short list of those with commit access 
can provide, nor should they be expected to provide each ticket with a 
patch.

The point, I suppose before I went off into about three or four tangents 
is the ownership of the bugs. It would be great if each bug had unit 
tests/acceptance tests/reproduce steps that prove the bug exists. 
However the quality of both the bug and the patch, depend entirely on 
the reporter and the coder who provides a patch. In the perfect 
community, those with commit access would be left to either commit 
patches and develop new code. Well, at least for open source.

However, I break my own rules (in that case they would be suggestions), 
so it makes sense. No blame on anyone, it was just an observation and 
epiphany I came upon while looking while going over many of the tickets.

However, DD32 seems to moot my point over the past day, so cheers to 
whoever that guy is.

Is there any way to determine how many functions have been hooked to a

do_action("foo",...);

causes any function to be called at all.

Thanks,

Yeah.

There is a global variable, called $wp_filter that holds all of the hooks.

So basically, mockup code would be like.

<?php

function get_foo_hooks()
{
    global $wp_filter;

    if( isset($wp_filter['foo']) )
    {
        $i = 0;
        foreach($wp_filter['foo'] as $priority)
          $i += count($priority);
       return $i;
    }
}
?>

Or something.

Thats a good idea, i'll jot it down :)

The other option i was going to include was perhaps somehow to show the function in-line, and have links defined on any functions within to their definition.

I'd also like to work in the WordPress versions where functions were added, so i can perhaps run it over plugins too, allthough plugins will have need for extra checks rather than just a function existing.

Thanks for the praise too :)

Maybe we can 'make public' all this stuff in a way or another, via  
codex or something else.
I'm realizing is really hard to keep track of all this useful things  
for me, and I guess I'm not the only one..
Or I'm missing *even* this part, and they are already listed there? :-)

Well, a link, I'm not sure where you'll put it. Probably on the Function 
Reference page. However, I just as well bookmarked the page. I'm mostly 
using it for the @since phpdoc tags (I'm not sure if Ozh won't kick my 
ass over that).

I put a link to this on various related pages on the codex (including
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference>) but I think simply
bookmarking it is the best way to keep it in mind :)

I went ahead and wrote up a small "anti spyware" plugin. It still has
a long way to go in development, but it's a start. Some people don't
think this is a good approach, but it's at least useful to me. :)

Both of these resources are now on the Developer Docs codex page, in 
the bottom section called "External Resources". Feel free to edit any 
other Codex pages you think should link to them.

That page looks to be very similar to the PHPXref reference that is 
already on the Dev Docs page.

I just couldn't let these gmail plugs go unrebutted!

Google is not good. With gmail's hosted mail service comes all of the 
Google privacy and other issues. I only recently realised WordPress uses 
google's related search by default, oh it saddened me so.

I don't want to start a Google debate, so please don't feel the need to 
reply to this thread. I feel two positive notes for Google and one 
negative makes a reasonable balance.

Cheers - Callum.

To change the behaviour of the upload tab, should I edit directly
uploads.php or there is some hook I can call from a plugin?

The best plugin I found when researching changes to the upload tab was
Flexible Upload[1], I think you can look at the code in there to see
how the author went about editing the upload interface.

Message-ID: <8810a71a0712100913n39df2c92yed140f544bee6ee1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I read somewhere that the 2.4 will contain a review of the admin.

I tried to do some work on my own to see own the navigation within admin was
coded.

I first tried to do this, that's the kind of admin menu organisation i would
like to have :
http://flickr.com/photos/nogent94130/sets/72157603398271468/show/

Then i modified wp-admin/menu.php... to get what i was expecting.

I was surprised to see that plugins tools such as add_menu_pages and
add_submenu_pages were not used at all.
And i found that some wp files in the admin have their submenu AND menu HARD
CODED in those files ... (wp_redirect i suppose)

SO $menu and $submenu are not the only variables to manage Wp admin
menues...

Am i right, Am i wrong.

What are the modification in admin on 2.4.

Thanks for your replies.

Google's hosted mail service works particularly well and allows for
very easy to use and custom domain email management. It has a
particularly good spam filtering service and even provides a simple to
setup Jabber interoperable server if you can make a few simple DNS
entries.

So, it is in fact, quite good. As are most all of Google's *free*
services, IMO.

Also, I've never seen any Google related privacy issue that doesn't
reek of tinfoil-hatism, so if you'd care to point out real issues,
then your comment might hold more weight. But simply saying "it's bad
I don't like it" really doesn't get you anywhere.

In the meantime, I highly recommend Google's email hosting services.
It just works incredibly well. I understand that Microsoft also
provides a similar service through their "Live" system, if you care to
try a different direction.

What upload tab? If you mean the upload frame in the post editor, then
you can replace it entirely by the 'uploading_iframe_src' filter. This
will let you make it call any file you want, including your own plugin
if you like.

I think he is referrring to the Uploads tab in the dashboard (the one
no one seems to know about or use ;-)

Tassoman, you can use the add page hook to add a page to the upload
manager, same as you would to any other page in the dashboard.

Im not sure if this topic has ever been discussed here before, and if it
has sorry for bringing it up again.

But a search function in uploads would be great, im soure this can be done
with plugins but i strongly belive that it should be a core wp feature.

Hi

When importing content from another WordPress blog (in 2.3), some of the 
nested structure of e.g. categories is retained but presumably because 
of conflicting IDs most seem to come in without the nesting.

Is this something someone is (or could be, or would want to be) looking at?
(I tried searching trac, but uhm,... just call me a fumbling idiot and 
get it over with)

Good point - so noted on Codex "Developer Documentation" page. Both 
xref pages are now there.

By the way, ANYONE can edit the codex. Please do so if you find 
errors, think there are any new resources that should be linked in, 
have some time on your hands and want to write a help file, etc. For 
instance, I've noticed some people adding function doc pages lately -- 
THANKS -- your contributions will be greatly appreciated by future 
generations of WordPress plugin and theme developers. More work is 
needed.... There's a page of "To Dos" for developer/hacker types here, 
if you have the inclination and don't know what needs doing:

It has been attempted several times over the past several years. For 
whatever reason Mediawiki upgrade scripts fail and no one involved with 
their project was able to help us. There's no other reason we're on an 
old version.

The problem with this is that unless you have a title for all your uploads,
search would probably be useless, since it would have to search by file
name, and those don't tend to be the most descriptive. The intentions of
having search for uploads is good, but realistically, I don't think it would
work that well.

It would be nice to see more thumbnails per page when browsing through the
uploads, though.

What about upgrading to 1.6.10 or lower first, then upgrading to the 
latest? It may work doing it incrementally, rather than in one big jump.

This is actually already on my list of things to do before the end of

Well, I just got a list of file differences. I extracted MW 1.11.0 over 
the top of 1.4.8 and did a comparison to the normal 1.11.0 installation. 
Attached are all the old files to delete in a text file.
I can also export a tab-delimited file, HTML, XML or tab-separated list 
if you want.

Also to note is that you'll need PHP 5 for 1.11.0, so you may have to 
take the codex down while you switch.

That version scheme makes me want to cry. If WordPress ever has a 
version 2.10, I'm killing myself.

G'day,

I'd rather not pursue this debate here, I just wanted to add some 
balance to the pro-Google comments.

Personally, I don't trust Google, I think things *could*[1] go very 
wrong (it's fiction), and I don't want a company to have that much data 
on me. My choice. Please don't tell me I wear a tin foil hat unless you 
actually know me and have a picture to prove it.

I'd warmly invite you to leave this discussion at 3 posts for Google, 2 
posts against. We each have our views, let's leave it at that. This will 
be my last post on the topic.

Cheers - Callum.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Charset SQL Injection Vulnerability
Message-ID: <op.t25mp4fok6w4mc@dd32.no-ip.com>

First and formost, This has been posted on PacketStormSecurity allready, And as such, Anyone who wants to use it maliciously, will be able to get their hands on it regardless of this posting, I think i've seen a SQL query similar to this mentioned recently somewhere that may've been disregarded(due to the charset needing to be set)

Secondly, This only affects WP's that are using a non-utf8 character encoding(ie. have defined a DB_CHARSET in their config), While there are a few other charsets which are not affected by this too.

Trunk is confirmed to be affected, Raw Md5's can be retrieved (Note: If a salt was stored too, it'd be accessable as well, it'd just be impossible for rainbow tables to crack it).

It also needs to know your table prefix.

So all in all, this will affect very few people, However, those who are affected, be warned :)

=== WordPress Charset SQL Injection Vulnerability ===

Release date: 2007-12-10
Last modified: 2007-12-10
Source: Abel Cheung
Affected version: WordPress escape($gpc);
}


  Finally, escape() method belongs to wp-includes/wp-db.php:

function escape($string) {
  return addslashes( $string ); // Disable rest for now, causing problems
  ......
}


3. Proof of concept

  a. After WordPress installation, modify wp-config.php to make sure
     it uses certain character set for database connection (Big5 can
also be used):
     define('DB_CHARSET', 'GBK');

  b. http://localhost/wordpress/index.php?exact=1&sentence=1&s=%b3%27)))/**/AND/**/ID=-1/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,4,5,user_pass,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24/**/FROM/**/wp_users%23


4. Workaround

  Note: This vulnerability only exists for database queries performed
  using certain character sets. For databases created in most other
  character sets no remedy is needed.

  a. It is recommended to convert WordPress database to use character sets not
     vulnerable to such SQL exploit. One such charset is UTF-8, which does not
     use backslash ('\') as part of character and it supports various languages.
  b. Alternatively, edit WordPress theme to remove search capability.

The problem is we used to stay on the latest versions and something 
about our DB schema is funky in a way that the upgraders don't 
understand, I think because we were on a beta version at some point.

Barry thinks he can figure it out, we'll see.

Well, when I tried upgrading at first on my development machine with the 
maintenance script, it gave me some database error. Worked perfectly 
using the installer again.

It certainly is possible though - other systems have the tagging functionality expanded to uploaded objects, so you can at least search by keyword or category.

The problem with this is that unless you have a title for all your uploads,
search would probably be useless, since it would have to search by file
name, and those don't tend to be the most descriptive. The intentions of
having search for uploads is good, but realistically, I don't think it would
work that well.

It would be nice to see more thumbnails per page when browsing through the
uploads, though.

Hi guys,

I'm trying to figure out how to pass the post_ID as argument when 
using the add_filter hook.

Besides the content I'm receiving automatically, I really can't 
figure out an workaround to passing the post_ID argument to the 
called function using add_filter('the_content', 'myfunc').


Thanks for your input on this.

You can't add extra arguments to the add_filter hook in order to
request that your receive arbitary data.

What you want to do is globalise the post ID global in your function
and use that.

This wouldn't occur if WP was using mysql_real_escape_string(), am I
correct?

GNOME 2.10 was released a few years ago.

Yep, the world is still going after that happened, and I have not yet

Yes but there's a catch. mysql_real_escape_string() doesn't take any
notice of SET NAMES or SET CHARACTER SET statements that have been
issued to change the character set of the mysql session. It continues to
use the original character until mysql_real_escape_string()
(PHP/mysqli's set_charset()) is called.

Unfortunatly mysqli's set_charset() requires PHP >= 5.0.5 and presumably
the presence of MySQL's mysql_real_escape_string() which requires MySQL
>= 5.0.7. So using set_charset() in WordPress may prove problematic. I
presume these were the problems referred to in the commented out code in
escape().

Potential alternatives I've thought about are to write an escaping
function similar to MySQL's escape_string_for_mysql() (mysys/charset.c
in the MySQL source), or, detect the environment which allows the
problem to occur and prompt the user to reconfigure MySQL so that the
client connection starts in the correct character set in the first
place. That second option may not be available to users of hosting
services. I'm sure other alternatives may exist.

Message-ID: <475FB1DC.1090405@bolarus.de>

Hi everyone!

Just a short question: Is there a particular reason why the export 
funtion does export posts, pages, categories... but not the links 
(blogroll)? I noticed this when I exported my content from my old test 
blog and imported it to my new blog. I then had to copy the already 
entered links manually (which is possible with five or ten links, but 
rather unrealistic with more than that). Just using a database dump is 
not always an option when moving content between different versions of 
WordPress.

So I'm wondering if excluding the links from the export was a conscious 
decision?! After all they are content like any post or category.

Greetings,
Johannes

You can download the OPML (/wp-links-opml.php I believe, or something
similar) then import it into your new weblog.

The 2.10 format seems pretty unusual nowadays from what I've seen.

Would it be 3.0?

Why would you update the version because your major revision went up
past "9"? That makes absolutely no sense.

Also, unusual how? Virtually every open source project in existence
uses that numbering scheme. Including WordPress. Note the existence of
versions 2.0.10 and 2.0.11:
http://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/


Don't think of the period as a decimal point, because it's not. It's
just a separator. Write it as version 2-9 if you like. Then 2-10 might
not bother you as much.

Um, 3.0?

Anyway, did anyone notice we have a WordPress 2.0.11?! Well, it was real 
nice knowing you, Jacob.

It makes no sense to bump the major revision because the minor revision goes
past 0.9. It's not a decimal -- it's just a separator. Otto said exactly
what I would say, so I'll just add a +1 to his explanation.

Gotta admit, I don't see any problems with it, it's the same numbering
scheme used by, well, everybody else in the world. I always use
version-major-minor numbering schemes myself.

Heck, Linux even adds another dot-number to it, the current stable
kernel version is 2.6.23.9. The fourth number is a revision or bugfix
number.

2.09 should be followed by 2.10.

2.90 should be followed by 3.00.

Well, sure... I was making the example using those version increments to
make my point. I figured people could fill in the blanks (as you did).

In Math, no. Zero's after the last "non-zero" mean nothing.

in that case, 2.9.1 would be a small improvement on 2.9, whereas 2.10  
would be an improvement of 2, subtle difference :)

2.10 is the same as 2.1...

I agree.

The point is that it would make sense if they started with 2.01.0 
instead. It bothers me when version schemes go: 1.0(0)... 1.1(0) ... 
1.2(0) ... 1.3(0) ... 1.4(0) ... 1.9(0) ... 1.10, which is how I think 
of it. So we are going back to 1.10? We were already there! D Language 
had the same scheme and some people went crazy also.

If you know ahead of time, and are planning to increment to that stage, 
then I would think starting at 1.01 makes more sense from my perspective 
of how numbering works. It seems unnatural therefore it would take a 
while to get used to the new scheme.

However, I was also kidding. I have no problem with D using it, 
therefore I have no problem with WordPress or X number of other 
applications. To me it just seems like they are arbitrary bumping the 
number to seem like they have advanced more than they really have.

When you use the scheme, Major.Minor.Revision, it appears better, 
because the brain won't get it confused with decimal math system. 1.0.0 
tells me that I'm looking at a version number, 1.10.0 does not bother me 
as much because of the many other projects that used this system. It is 
entirely a mental argument so it goes along with coding standards. If 
you decide beforehand that you are going to not bump the major version 
just because you reach #.9 without any major architecture change, then 
I'm all for it. However, if you've decided to go 9 minor versions 
without plans on the next 3.0 release, then that doesn't seem too 
professional.

Deciding whether to bump the next Major version doesn't require major 
architecture changes. It makes more sense to do so, but if everyone 
decides that the 2.x branch has matured enough, then you can bump to the 
next version based on stability and not based on new features. Hell, by 
the time that happens it would be about 18 months. I would think that 
within that time, WordPress would be stable enough to bump to the next 
major version.  I would rather major versions be bumped based on 
stability and not features, because that says that 3.0 will be unstable 
for a while.

We could argue this forever. PHP uses Major.MinorRevision, which makes a 
lot more sense. 1.1 ... 1.11 ... 1.2 ... 1.22 ... 1.33 ... 1.44 ..1.99 
... 1.100. However, PHP has not yet gotten to the point where it had 
more than a 5 Minor Revision or at least with Major versions 4 and 5.

I also dislike, while we are still on the subject, the Linux scheme of 
odd minor versions being development versions and even being stable 
versions. It makes since, totally. However, it takes a while to get used 
to it. When it do, it appears much better because you automatically know 
that 1.1 is beta and 1.2 is stable. If you looked and seen a version 
like 3.3, you would know that it is unstable and you should wait until 
3.4 comes out. Not many people follow this, and because it isn't 
universal it is frustrating.

No, I don't find WordPress 2.0.10 offensive because of the above. Also, 
no I won't kill myself if WordPress team ever decides to release a 2.10 
version. Or least I'll be over it by the time 2.11 comes out.

No it's not. Version numbers are not decimals, they never have been.

Note that not even the bizarre underused version thinks that 3.0 comes
one minor revision after 2.9, or that 2.10 is the same as 2.1.

Is there any project anywhere that uses the 2.8 -> 2.9 -> 3.0
versioning scheme? Or one that thinks 2.10 is the same as 2.1?

I don't know, and don't particularly care. This is O/T anyways, so let's end
this "arguement".

Message-ID: <B9631D2E-9D6F-40E7-B34F-596D252A42B8@amphibian.info>

Hey all,

I'm having an odd problem with my plugin on IIS, maybe someone can  
clue me in.  My plugin adds a top-level menu, with several sub-pages.   
One of them is an options page.  As per the codex docs, my form points  
to options.php, with the nonce field.  In all my testing, this works  
great - updates options, and redirects back to my plugin's options  
page with my query string.

But it seems on IIS (or on one particular user's WP install on IIS  
anyway), the referrer that I assume options.php is using to know where  
to redirect to is stripping the "admin.php" from the url, so instead  
of going back to where it should:

example.com/wp-admin/?admin.php?&page=gp-options&updated=true

It's sending this user to:

example.com/wp-admin/?page=gp-options&updated=true

I've had him disable all other plugins, still no dice.  Anyone  
encountered this problem?

TIA,
Derek

There is also a second catch: original content may not be all valid data
within a certain encoding. In my example 0xB327 is not a valid character
in either Big5 or GBK. Usually in such cases the first byte is ignored, then
viola, the second byte becomes a standalone single quote, and is escaped
with backslash.

For what it's worth: I've been running on IIS for the past 2 years of so
with all sorts of code - I've had all kinds of compatibility issues, but
I've never (ever) had a problem with IIS incorrectly reporting refer info.

Not all cultures use a period (dot) as the decimal separator.
Europeans (probably not all of them, admittedly) tend to use the comma
as a decimal separator. Like "2,9" instead of "2.9". Most of these
cultures also use the period (dot) as the thousands marker. Example:
"12.345,69" instead of "12,345.69".

The choice of a separator in a versioning scheme is completely
arbitrary, as is the choice of nomenclature in mathematical
expressions.

And that's my nickel's worth of trivia for today. Coming soon: Presidents!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Pushing Inline Documentation Patches
Message-ID: <4761CCD9.5010504@santosj.name>

With everything more important going on, I think that phpdoc effort 
should be on the back burner. However, when time is available can these 
issues be addressed? Oh yeah, before I forget, I want to thank you for 
the quick commit of deprecated.php documentation. That was super awesome!

1. Regarding the patch on ticket #4393 and author-template.php 
documentation, I went ahead and added @since information (based off of 
Ozh 
http://planetozh.com/projects/wordpress-functions-history/table_light.html) 
and cleaned up some of the PHPdoc tags. I haven't yet posted the patch, 
since I'm unsure whether I should reopen the old one (#4393) or create a 
new one. I'll most likely create a new ticket.

2. When creating an phpDocumentor site, third party libraries are 
included, which is incorrect behavior. I created a patch that excludes 
the external libraries (see #5443) by using file level phpdoc 
documentation and using a different package name. They will still be 
included, however the functions/classes will no longer be mixed with 
WordPress package functions/classes, which is the correct behavior.

While I'm not sure it wouldn't cause problems, I think it would be an 
advantage to have the patch committed. If and when a WordPress 
phpDocumentor site is created.

3. I made a patch for post.php a long time ago (#3982) based off in part 
the previous patch that was made. As I didn't read too far into the 
ticket discussion, I failed to realize the problems inherit in the first 
patch, which also appears in mine. While I haven't yet gone back over 
the functions and made corrections to the patch, I would be super happy 
if the patch could be committed or some pointers made on how it can get 
to the point where it is ready to be committed.

Also, since it has been a while, I'm not entirely sure the patch will 
commit. If not then, I can create a new patch based off a recent 
repository revision, when I get around to completing and fixing the errors.

4. Dude! Finished the Taxonomy API phpdoc style documentation (#4742). 
It would totally kick ass to close that ticket out.

5. Is there any chance that the phpdoc documentation for wp-settings.php 
(#5211) or wp-includes/vars.php and wp-includes/version.php (also #5211) 
will get in? If not, then would it be wise to close the tickets as 
invalid (the patch for wp-settings.php might be stale anyway since the 
last one is based off of 6311) or won't fix? I would argue that the file 
level documentation makes it worth it for xref sites that include that 
along side the file name, as well as the advantage to phpDocumentor sites.

I basically wrote the documentation for wp-settings.php as a test to see 
what the documentation would look like and practice so that the 
documentation for other files wouldn't suck as much. I think it could be 
useful, as there are a lot of globals and functions (that need to be 
made private) in wp-settings.php that could be referenced in a 
phpdocumentor site. For that reason, I documented vars.php and 
version.php so that when you use @uses $wp_version, phpDocumentor would 
know what you are talking about and reference that global.


Since I'm out of school for the next month, I plan on doing some more 
documentation and hopefully helping with unit tests. After that, 
hopefully someone else will pick up the documentation effort. Which you 
know, there have been people before me, so I can only assume that 
someone will come along after me. Anyone? It is very fun and no, I'm not 
being sarcastic.

Its a great way to discover WP functionality and functions that you never knew existed as well, You're almost bound to come accross an unknown(or rare) bug or 2 as well in the process.

Either way.  Reopening is fine.

We usually avoid changing third party files.  Maybe we can make an
exception for phpdoc.

Committed.  A few parts didn't apply so a follow on patch is needed.

I'm fine with it.  Thoughts from others?

$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] in my form options.
If you search for it, you found some notes about the 100% Apache-

Yep, it was originally posted to this list even.
http://neosmart.net/blog/2006/100-apache-compliant-request_uri-for-iis-and-w
indows/

You (as a developer) can either use the "fallback method" to calculate the
correct request_uri value, or your users can install the script on their
server to ensure 100% correct request_uri for all php scripts.

Cheers.

Personally, I just handle $_POST myself so that I can do some error checking
and stuff first. That makes the form easy:

Message-ID: <6cfd47af0712140733y25c98580r1b4d955e11a19da9@mail.gmail.com>

I'm testing an upgrade to 2.3, and I noticed that widgets were having
problems, but only on pages on which I hadn't made any changes to the
widgets since upgrading. If I saved a page as-is, the widgets would
start rendering problem-free.

So I saved a page (having made no changes), and looked at the DB
before and after:

Before
(4082, 2935, '_widgeties',
'a:3:{s:9:"sidebar-1";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"pb-3";}s:9:"sidebar-2";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"pb-1";}s:9:"sidebar-3";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"pb-2";}}'),

After
(4082, 2935, '_widgeties',
's:117:"a:3:{s:9:"sidebar-1";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"pb-3";}s:9:"sidebar-2";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"pb-1";}s:9:"sidebar-3";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"pb-2";}}";'),

...so the change that I can see is that it's now part of the data is
encapsulated, like so:

s:117:"DATAHERE";

Does anyone know what the "s:117" is referring to, and what the change
was made in regards to?

What do you mean "only on pages"? Widgets do not support per-page
configuration currently.

Are you using some kind of plugin to allow this? I searched and could
not find "widgeties" anywhere in the normal source code.

As for the s:117, that's WordPress's way of specifying a string.

Example:
a:1:{i:0;s:4:"pb-3";}

That's specifying an array with 1 item in it. When it's parsed back
into a PHP array, it'll have arrayname[0]="pb-3". The i:0 is an
integer. The s:4:"pb-3" is a string. The four means 4 characters in
it.

So, what you posted shows a 117 character long string. It just happens
to contain something that itself is a serialized array. I suspect that
the plugin you're using works differently under 2.3 than it did
before.

"As for the s:117, that's WordPress's way of specifying a string."

It's actually the PHP serialize function's way, not just WP. (

I must've accidentally cut off part of the email before I sent it.

The missing paragraph:

"I've developed a plugin (dev name 'widgeties') that allows for widget
layout and configuration to be saved on a per-page and a per-post
basis. Most of the dev has taken place under 2.1 and 2.2, but I'm
hoping to polish it up and release it sometime in the near future."

You're probably right, Otto, for some reason the plugin isn't
reading/writing in the same format under 2.3 that it is in 2.2. Given
that it works fine after being saved I wouldn't really care, honestly,
except that I have an install of 2.2 with about 3000 pages/posts, many
of them having customized widget layouts and configs. I'll find a way
to automate the upgrade.

Perhaps it's just the lack of sleep, but can you please explain how manually
checking the contents of $_POST gets around mangled request_uri values?

Thanks...

Personally, I just handle $_POST myself so that I can do some error checking
and stuff first. That makes the form easy:

<form method="post" action="">

I'm looking to see if there were any changes to how/when get_post_meta
(or related functions)  serialize and unserialize between 2.2 and 2.3,
I think that's where my problems are.

Message-ID: <4763A5E1.5060005@cobalt.cc>

Hi there, im new to this mailinglist-thing in general and just stumbled 
upon a little thing which forced me to hack a wp core file, something i 
dont really like to do.
if you insert something like $current to the <li> -> <li$current>, you 
can style the li tag via css in a similiar way to wp_list_categories. If 
this is old and i just dont know about it, dont hang me ;).

$current = ('html' == $format && is_archive() && !is_category() && $text 
== get_the_time('F Y')) ? ' class="current-archive"' : '';

regards, mo

Unsure why I failed to reply this sooner. Getting table prefix is so

As trivial as? This is a bit of an annoying way to present a software
bug. Anyway, thank you very much for letting us know about this!

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5471
?feed=rss2&p=-1 results in db error, showing sql query (table prefixes)

The whole WordPress community really appreciate your help in
uncovering these issues. Are there other issues you know about that
you can share at this time?
(Assuming you haven't emailed security@wordpress.org and are giving
them an opportunity to fix the issue prior to public disclosure.)

Thanks again,
Lloyd

I've never understood why WordPress displays detailed SQL errors in an
environment that is almost definitely production. Maybe it would be more
prudent to be able to disable these? If something got changed around I
wouldn't want my visitors to be seeing paragraphs of SQL errors everywhere.

Hi Robin,

Can you provide some specific examples of these? (bug #s) Generally,
that isn't the case, and my experience has been that they have been
fixed when identified.

Thanks,
Lloyd

I think he may be talking about suppressing DB errors in general.  For
example, currently WP calls the wpdb show_errors method in several
places.  It seems to me that the show_errors object variable should be
set to false, and the show_errors method should be called only if
WP_DEBUG is set to true.  Were that the case, the error mentioned in
this thread would not show.

I agree with this, definely! Currently I had to hack my Wordpress in 
order to hide those errors, and show a courtesy message (something more 
user friendly, like "we apologyze for the inconvenience, and will be 
back as soon as possible") to my visitors. I hope next versions of 
Wordpress will include this feature by default.

Matt-

I saw that earlier today and I agree... if the cookie isn't set, wp- 
admin will redirect to wp-login.php. And if he is able to access wp- 
admin (say with open registration, which is legit), what he can view  
is going to be subject to a cap check. Either he's smoking something  
or he hasn't provided all the info.

My take.

I agree.

We should also take the WordPress logo out of pages we show when the 
blog is down, it's bad associations. :)

The low standard of comments on Digg is beaten only by YouTube. Getting
rid of that association can only be a good thing.

photomatt:
        Our free hosting is on the same grid (hundreds of servers) that
        our VIPs are, so whether you're free or VIP your site still
        won't ever go down due to increased traffic. When Anousheh
        Ansari went to space her blog was on WP.com, and it got Dugg,
        Slashdotted, BBCed, Farked, and Yahooed within hours of each
        other, it was fine.

nreynolds:
        @ photomat
        I understand that you work for Wordpress, but that's just
        ridiculous. The Wordpress database error is the most common
        error on Digg, and it happens ALL THE TIME.

Makes me want to throw up.

Maybe they should have had different names (WP.org and the actual software,
I mean)... It would mean less confusion for the n00bs. :P

I'd like to say +1 from me too
I'm sick of people blaming WordPress because some moron is using it on a host which cannot handle the ammount of traffic which is being directed at it, Quite often the site is rather responsive too, its just that MySQL is rejecting connection attempts.

Just to throw a thought out about this quickly:
Currently WP connects to the database as soon as its loaded, correct? Regardless of if any queries are going to be made.

This happens before any caching plugins have a chance to take over, Maybe WordPress should delay connecting to the database until a query is actually sent?, That way, If a user has a HTML Caching plugin installed, it should be able to spit out the page without ever requiring a database connection(Thats making the assumption that the caching plugin doesnt require get_option() -- I guess the Object cache would be helpful there).

I know its possible for hosts to be setup and handle WP very well, But the majority of shared hosters have low mysql connection limits.. which is why WordPress gets such a bad rep amongst the digg crowd(Who honestly, You'd hope would know better than to blame WP for a 3rd party glitch.. Then again, *most* would blame Vista for a hardwares driver not working correctly..)

Not if you're using WP-Super-Cache. It uses mod_rewrite to serve up
static HTML pages without even needing to touch PHP or MySQL.

No. It includes the advanced-cache.php file before it connects to the
DB. Assuming the caching plugin returns a cached page and exits, the
DB never gets connected to.

WP-Cache does this correctly. WP-Super-Cache bypasses PHP entirely by
generating HTML files that are served statically (via a rewriterule in
.htaccess).

He's severely confused about what the is_admin() function does. As we
know, is_admin() returns true when you're looking at any of the admin
pages.

He seems to think that it's supposed to tell whether the user is an
admin or not, which is not the case.

Anyway, his "flaw" does not work.

oops, Mis-read the file :) I mixed the Advaned and Object cache include lines.

So yes.. If a HTML caching plugin is enabled the databse isnt hit/loaded.

However, The DB is still connected to even if the Object cache contains all the needed data though.

Don't expect more of 0.1% of the connected world to understand the
difference between wp.org and wp.com :)

Maybe the "db down" message could be more informative, instead of just
removing every WP logo ? Something like "this blog is currently
experiencing problems with its own database etc...".

Subject: [wp-hackers] New secure cookie protocol in trunk
Message-ID: <c8f37c930712161000i759a581cq437572ba94ba0d18@mail.gmail.com>

(Cross-posted to hackers and testers)

A new cookie protocol has landed in trunk.  This protocol is based on
the one described here:

http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf

The cookie is laid out like so:

user name|expiration time|HMAC( user name|expiration time, k)
where k = HMAC(user name|expiration time, sk)
and where sk is a secret key

sk, the secret key, consists of a random string saved to the options
table in  a "secret" field and a user definable secret key specified
in wp-config.php with the SECRET_KEY define.  If SECRET_KEY is not
defined, the DB connect info is used to construct SECRET_KEY.  Cookies
can be mass-expired by changing SECRET_KEY or "secret" in the options
table.

This protocol requires the hash_hmac() function.  This function is
available only in php 5.1.2 and later, so we added a php
implementation of it to compat.php.  If you are using PHP versions <
5.1.2, let us know if you have any troubles with regard to
hash_hmac().

The cookie design is still being discussed, so expect some more
changes.  You can join the ongoing design discussion here:

Annoying? This has been fully disclosed to public since July:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Would providing PHPdoc templates for all included
	files be committed?
Message-ID: <4765CDF0.50205@santosj.name>

One of the major pushes I would like propose is at least getting a 
phpdoc structure for every PHP function in wp-includes/. This would 
leave out the short description and long description for the functions 
that weren't finished. If the patches and proposal are rejected as is, 
then I'll still continue to document and finish as many files as 
possible. The end result in the worse case is less files would be 
documented or appear to be documented and the templates for each file 
will remain patches under their respective tickets until someone comes 
along and finishes the patch. Either way shouldn't be as bad.

*Well, there are several problems that I feel need to be addressed with 
this proposal.*

1. It will appear quite ugly to have every undocumented function with 
{@internal Missing Short Description}} and {@internal Missing Long 
Description}}.

While I agree, it would allow for those people to just replace those 
areas with their text and submit a patch. It would remove the need for 
them to also document parameters and return types. It would also make 
clear that the devs are aware that documentation is missing in those 
areas and awaiting documentation to fill those areas. Ha ha, there are 
already some functions with that style already. Sorry!

It would also standardize the comment style, unless the author replaces 
it completely, but it appears slightly confusing to have:

/**
 *
 */

Along with:

//
//

Along with:

/*
 *
 */

The standard is the first one and having the template would make that 
clear to those who wish to add documentation later.

2. Leaving parameter and return type information wouldn't make the 
documentation worth committing.

While the alternative is to give just the type and the variable name. I 
think leaving the area after blank means the same as {@internal Missing 
Description}} and it would be better to explicitly say that than to 
leave it implicit and assume that the reader understands that. Also, the 
reader might be more willing to fill out the information if the note is 
left there than if it wasn't. It would be how I would do it. However, 
adding it might just leave the reader saying "WTF? Why didn't they just 
fill it out?" Eh.

Really it is up to debate and why I would rather have all of the 
parameters and return information documented. That would mean that the 
short and long descriptions might have to be omitted, at least for now.


*Why I think the proposal is a good idea: Besides the arguments above.*

1. It would document every file purpose (in wp-includes/), so every 
function will be grouped with WordPress that belongs with WordPress and 
file level description will show up on xref sites as well as 
phpDocumentor sites.

2. It would show readers of the functions that an effort has been made 
and a standard is already in place for handling inline documentation. 
Which hopefully would keep another inline documentation discussion 
(about adding inline documentation and why there doesn't exist inline 
documentation/standard) from occurring 6 months to a year from now.

Any other reason why the proposed wouldn't be committed?

FYI Proposed template is as follows:

/**
 * function_name() - {@internal Missing Short Description}}
 *
 * {@internal Missing Long Description}}
 *
 * @since version
 * @uses information about what globals and functions the function uses.
 *
 * ... Parameters type/description and return type/description
 */

Also, I'm not proposing that someone do this, I'm already doing it. I 
just want to know if what I don't get finished will be committed when I 
stop documenting WordPress functions.

Absolutely annoying! This isn't directed at you, but a more general
observation, if people want to represent themselves to be a high
standards of professional developers, particularly software security
experts, then any public disclosure should include reporting
information -- particularly when there is a *public* bug tracker.

Sorry to bug the whole list with this, but I didn't know who to contact
directly.

I committed a bugfix for a plugin of mine yesterday, but the site hasn't
updated:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/global-plugin-update-notice/

I checked SVN and it's indeed 1.0.1 in there.

Any ideas?

Currently trying to track down the issue with the plugin directory not  
auto-updating.  I went ahead and updated your plugin manually.

He emailed me with more information on this.. I think I see what he's
talking about, although I still can't reproduce it.

Create a blank blog with default permalinks.
Create a draft post.

Go to http://example.com/wp/'wp-admin/ . The single quote there is intentional.

The existence of the "wp-admin/" triggers is_admin() to return true.
And this code in query.php:

elseif ( !$this->is_singular ) {
	$where .= " AND (post_status = 'publish'";

	if ( is_admin() )
		$where .= " OR post_status = 'future' OR post_status = 'draft' OR
post_status = 'pending'";

	if ( is_user_logged_in() ) {
		$where .= current_user_can( "read_private_{$post_type}s" ) ? " OR
post_status = 'private'" : " OR post_author = $user_ID AND post_status
= 'private'";
	}

	$where .= ')';
}

Causes it to display the drafts when the user is not logged in.

I think that's what he's saying. I can't get it to work on my testbed
yet, but he insists that it does.

Message-ID: <000001c84139$1bbea780$533bf680$@net>

Hey all,

 

Just a quick question: there've been a lot of posts to wp-hackers about
problems with the official plugins repository.

Who is the right person/email/whatever to use for these matters? Perhaps
this info needs to be added to the site somewhere?

 

Cheers,

CG

If you have a Bug Hunt set for Weds, and it's Tuesday now at 9:010am EST 
for me, why not try and pound in some/ alot of those smaller (not so 
important) tickets / with patches? I don't have the links off hand, but 
I seen a good number of them though while in Trac the other day.

There's 500 some tickets sitting there currently, Jan 24th release date 
is going to arrive quicker than we think... Shouldn't "we" get as much 
pounded in as possible, especially before the bug hunt? Or, what really 
do you guys/gals have planned yet for 2.4 before shipping it out the 
door? Just was curious.... =P

I'm having a problem similar to this, with my 'TextMe' plugin. I
received an email on the 15th (3 days ago) that it was approved, but 3
days later, it still isn't in the SVN. I'm very confused as to what to
do.

I posted a support topic here, for more information:

There are plenty of reasons to close a ticket or reject a patch, but
there are quite a number of tickets (with patches) sitting there on
Trac without so much as a whisper of feedback, let alone any kind of
conclusion. Here are a couple of mine:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5442
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5393

And some other people's:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5293
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5398

There are plenty more examples out there. Are the authors of these
tickets doing something wrong? If so, what do we need to do to get
some attention directed towards these issues? Some (most?) of these
things are pretty minor and the ticket authors may feel they're not
worth making a big fuss over on this mailing list and so on, but if we
don't say anything, chances are they'll just sit there forever.

Which brings me to my second question: if we're not doing something
wrong, does the WordPress core team need another member who would be
prepared to go through all these minor tickets and implement or close
them as appropriate? Alternatively, perhaps we just need a couple of
people with a direct line to the core team who can go through these
tickets and bring attention to them when they're at a point where they
can be implemented. I've been on #wordpress-dev (or whatever the dev
channel's called, can't remember off the top of my head) a few times
in the hopes of bothering somebody about them, but everyone's always
idle when I'm on there (probably just the timezone thing).

Either way, I understand that the core team are very busy, both with
WordPress and their day jobs, but when Matt can post a ticket about a
defect, have an answer within a day, and then the ticket sits idle for
two weeks, the process is perhaps not going quite as intended.

You know what would be nicer, is this:

a) Make a Ticket / with Patch storage bin. Have the storage bin separate 
from each branch/trunk versions. But have all the Tickets/ with Patches 
assigned to a specific version in the Trac Ticket Storage Bin. So, it 
would be like this:

Ticket Bin:
branch X.X.X/ - (XXX amount of tickets)
branch X.X.XX/ - (XXX amount of tickets)
Trunk X.X/ - (XXX amount of tickets)

Roadmap:
Milestone X.X.X - (X amount of tickets added from this branch/milestone 
ticket bin that the devs are sure to commit at a specific time frame)
Milestone X.X.XX - (X amount of tickets added from this branch/milestone 
ticket bin that the devs are sure to commit at a specific time frame)
Milestone X.X (Trunk) - (X amount of tickets added from this 
trunk/milestone ticket bin that the devs are sure to commit at a 
specific time frame)

I know it seems pointless, but it could help clean up things and keep 
things organized better. Rather than packing tickets under a milestone 
or trunk right away (resulting in ticket bumps from version to version) 
they could be stored in the "bin" and assigned to a specific version. 
Then chosen by the devs which ones to actually MOVE under the Milestones 
specifically that the devs are for sure going to commit at a given deadline.

THEN, the remaining "uncommitted" tickets/fixes for each specific 
Milestone will remain in the "bin" for later deciding of where it should 
go. There would really be much "bumping" of tickets at all then. Because 
the "uncertain ones" will remain in the "bin" until later or after 
finding the best place(s) for "it". So again, it would basically be like...

a) User submits new ticket, it ends up in the "bin" under that specific 
branch/trunk version. It sits in there until noticed, and then decided 
what to do with it. (This is how it is now of course, while sitting 
under each Milestone it's assigned. But I'm thinking of keeping things 
from being bumped constantly and or organized better, for when actually 
getting around to the tickets submitted there.)

b) Devs see a ticket/a handful of tickets that they really want to 
commit, they can just MOVE those tickets from the "bin", to under the 
specific milestone being worked on at the specific time. So "they" know 
this ticket, that ticket, and this ticket is going to be committed by X 
Date / Time Frame. And to help from weeding through TONS of tickets that 
probably won't ever make it in to begin with...

c) Tickets left in the "bin", can sit there and wait until a decision is 
made on what to do with them. Rather than constantly bumping from 
version to version Milestones.

Oh, I forgot d)...
Just delete the crap tickets that have been there for the longest time, 
and most likely won't ever be committed in this lifetime of 
WordPress.... =P

To be perfectly honest I'd rather look for a practical solution in the
here and now than indulge in fantasies about rewriting Trac.

LOL! Ah well, it was worth a shot... Nah, I agree with you though. 
However, your discussion was brought up before a few times though, and 
all the discussions never really came to any "practical solutions". Why? 
Because there are so many tickets submitted that it's not funny. And the 
devs can't always get to them all. Or, they forget about them, or there 
were changes made to a version/milestone, which then makes X tickets

In the footer of the pages on wordpress.org there is Report a Site
Bug, http://wordpress.org/report-bugs/

Hope that helps,

To me that's more for bugs with the site, not necessarily the plugin
repository. It might be more clear to make a mailing list or a contact email
specifically for that.

I can't reproduce it either - not really sure how the single quote in the
URL helps at all though? Also, on the BugTraq post he put 3 t's in the
http... So I ignored the single quote as a mistake as well. Meh, Aaron could
be correct; maybe he is smoking something...

The single quote in the URL (possibly any other character as well)
makes WordPress go to the main page and not the admin pages, but the
URL still contains "wp-admin/" and so is_admin() will return true.

Maybe is_admin() should check if is_user_logged_in().  Only logged in
users should be in the admin.

How about instead setting a constant, say "WP_ADMIN," to true in
admin.php right before requiring wp-config.php?

I have three:

#4048 - Has patch, needs-testing, but basically should just work.

#2927 - Has patch, has been tested, works, ready for commit.

#4754 - Pretty trivial so it should have already been committed early.

I'm probably going to miss the hunt, but it should be interesting.

As noted on the ticket - the patch is untested.

Once we have confirmation that the fix works or time to test it
ourselves it will then be committed.

I'm guessing by the lack of replies that no one has a solution.

Should I just go ahead and resubmit it, then?

After his clarifying post I can reproduce this. Create a draft post. Log
out.

Visit http://yourblog.com/index.php/'wp-admin/ and the draft will be
displayed because query.php mistakenly uses is_admin() on link 1172 to
check if the user is an administrator.

I'll open a ticket shortly after I've made myself a coffee =)

Some more properties forgotten:

1. All draft posts will appear to be dated at 1999-11-30.
2. Single quote is not even needed in my tests, which use
  http://yourblog.com/index.php/wp-admin/
3. Workaround: password protect all draft posts.

Here is the 2nd confirmation that the said problem can be reproduced:

1. login and create draft post
2. save the draft post and logout
3. Go to the aforementioned URL and draft post is shown

This is tested with 2.3.1, 2.2.3 and 2.2.0.

If you core dev/people really don't like it, please close it instead  
of bumping to the next version again... Nobody replied since february!

I agree. I was just over there yesterday/ last night and noticed a few 
were bumped to version 2.5. Rather then bumping the versions, why not 
just scrap them? I mean, they aren't going to get touched in the next 
version anyway... they only continue to build up, to where you can't get 
ahead anymore.

I still think that someone other than MediaWiki should be used. Maybe
dedicate a whole new site (or just a sub-domain) to a Wikipedia-style Wiki?
Just a thought.

I'm sorry if this comes across being directed personally at you but
those of us who are interested in working on old bugs, writing and
testing patches know how to find them in trac if we wish.

My thoughts don't count for much but I don't think that simply posting a
plain list of tickets you think need action is not likely to solicit the
results you're looking for. Instead try to think why tickets have seen
little action.

As an example you listed #2648 which is a patch to a file that no longer
exists. I think that one could quite easily be resolved.

Wikipedia is running MediaWiki 1.12alpha
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Version

Codex is running MediaWiki 1.11.0
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Version

Might want to consider changing the Skin to Monobook under your Preferences:

I'm not taking it personal. =) I posted the ticket urls in an attempt to 
get something done with them quicker. (Either; commit it, or forget it 
wise)  I know you all check Trac if you want to work on something 
specific and etc. But for example: #2648 .... would/could sit there for 
weeks more, or maybe even bumped to another version by accident, or 
something... when really it could just be deleted NOW... not later... I 
also went through the tickets, seen the comments and etc as well. I know 
what was discussed in them, I know their status and state. Few of them 
are awaiting for Happy Cog redesign. Few of them ha ve patches to files 
that no longer exist or their file names were changed, or they just 
basically irrelevant... The plain list isn't to piss people off, but to 
help bring attention to the "junk in the trunk" to help get it done 
soon, or have it removed soon because it's "junk"...

Not saying they are all "Junk" of course...some are literally CRAP.. I 
mean, let me rent a backhoe so I can dig my own hole quicker.. this 
shovel digging is exhausting...  =P Nah, not all the tickets are "junk", 
they just need some TLC now.. not years down the road when WordPress 
hits version(s) 5 - 10...

I think resolving it is the point.  If it's such a slam dunk, why is  
it still in Trac?  (Okay, I see that it was just resolved _today_  
which kind of makes the point of having drawn attention to it.)

At the least, things should be marked "Ain't gonna", "Obsolete",  
"Waiting for TinyMCE update", or whatever.  Right now many of them  
are "Waiting for Godot" -- hanging in limbo -- which gives the people  
volunteering their efforts the impression that they're efforts are  
ignored, which is not good for the future of WordPress.

I've had a particular patch in for months now.  It would be nice to  
see _some_ indication of whether anybody is even considering it.   
Obviously it's not all going to be decided a day after submission,  
but six months later there ought to be _something_.

I do not mean to insult any of the "higher ups" at WordPress.   
Obviously there are a _ton_ of bugs submitted, and a lot of patches,  
and it's a lot to slog through.  But when somebody takes the time to  
write a patch, somebody, somewhere, should give some feedback -- yes,  
this might be used/no it's crap/it needs work/whatever.

Regards,
Stephen

Nothing is stopping you. If you find a ticket that can be clearly be
resolved without a developer's attention and any dispute, then do so
(making sure you state your reasoning in the ticket). The worst that can
happen is someone will reopen the ticket which should lead to a
constructive discussion. :-)

Which ticket are your referring to? Context is useful is resolving  
these issues.

I try and respond to things as they come in - i spend a long time  
churning through the emails that are sent to the wp-trac list and try  
and respond to tickets.

If you want feedback on something feel free to assign it to me and It  
will be higher on my radar.

I know the frustration of watching ones patches sit in trac for  
months - I've been there and I am trying to resolve the issue by  
getting things committed!

Howdy all,
As we all know, the end of 2007 is rapidly approaching, with January
24th right behind.  With just a hair more than a month to go, does it
still make sense to pursue the admin rework/Happy Cog contributions as
a 2.4 goal?

I personally do not feel that a radical rework such as the one that
has been hinted at is something that can have all its glitches, bugs,
etc. shaken out in a single month.

I'm also of the opinion that trunk currently exemplifies the
culmination of WordPress, particularly in terms of security (see:
login cookie rework). I'd therefore be hesitant to recommend letting
the whole release slip.

Therefore, I'd like to suggest that the HC/rework code be left out,
but then placed in almost IMMEDIATELY following the 2.4 release so
that all bugs and pitfalls can be sussed out by the community prior to
a 2.5 release.

Thoughts?

Thanks for your opinion. I'm going to make a decision about this over

I agree with you on this. But I'm not one of those people to just close 
other peoples tickets and such. Just like in the support forums, 
moderators don't go by marking threads "Resolved" that other people 
started.. They COULD do it.. but they choose NOT to do it. I follow the 
same ethics as the forums. If it's not mine... I'm not going to go out 
of my way and close it or whatever.

I merely pointed it out, to bring attention to it quicker. I wasn't sure 
if the ticket submitter is on this list or not, but figured how could it 
hurt sending it through anyway. A few were OLD OLD ones, some not so 
old, etc etc... but as each day goes by, those tickets sit there.. while 
release date nears...And only the actual people with "svn commit rights" 
can do what they want with them...

I know you're on a time frame release schedule, but like someone else 
said on wp-testers... Why not just do what you have to do to get it in 
there or whatever, and release when it's "ready"? Does it have to be 
released Jan 24th? *ducks under table quick *

Exactly. And if I remember correctly... someone, I think it was Ryan... 
asked people on here what they thought should be "high priority" tickets 
or tickets that people would like to see get more attention... And what 
better to knock out first, than the simpler tickets... Especially with 
an Admin redesign coming soon, you can only touch so much tickets 
without interfering with it.. I know I pointed out SOME tickets that 
were pending on the Admin redesign... but they were also planned for 2.4 
though, as well as the Admin redesign stuff...

I agree with this as well. I was going to say more, but I have to leave 
for work. Hopefully things workout here soon. There's so much backlog of 
tickets in Trac now that it's not funny...sigh. Aight.. I'm off for work..

Question: Why do the "Views" and "Toolbox" sections appear on the left
hand side of the page only when I'm *not* logged into the codex?
That's really annoying.

Correction: They appear on the right hand side of the page, not the
left. The question still stands though.

Sorry for the late introduction into this discussion, but I feel 
somewhat differently about tickets. I agree with you, with more than one 
point, my personal opinion on tickets is that you have to show each one 
some love. However, the main problem is that I feel that the reporter 
should show the ticket love too. You can't just give birth to this 
ticket and wander off. If the details aren't clear enough then the specs 
will never be sorted out and the ticket isn't worth taking the time to 
write for. I do agree that if you don't know better than it probably 
isn't a good idea to close a ticket out. I've left tickets open that I 
thought should be closed because I didn't feel it was within my right 
and expertise to know whether the ticket should be closed.

At least that is how I would feel if I had my own open source project, 
but I'm pretty sure that with 500+ tickets, limited time, and various 
degrees of I-really-don't-care-for-that-ticket that project might fall 
into the same state.

I don't particularly agree with your assertion that the more complex 
tickets should be committed before the simple ones. You can most likely 
knock out 10 simple tickets in the time it would take to write and argue 
the points for a more complex one. Take the cookie authentication 
change. It took weeks to finish that and it is still open for 
opinion/discussion, which I think is a good thing. I think security is 
extremely important, but you can't hold back everything.

Eh, I've written a couple of patches (#4779 for example, few others 
probably) that may never see the light of day. At least not without a 
lot of debate (which hasn't started yet). For those that haven't had 
their patches committed, then I suppose you really need to explain why 
your patches should be committed. That is basically had I did it. I 
suppose and bitching a lot, it helps sometimes to bitch about tickets.

Open source in general, developers show love towards a problem that woos 
them. I mean, sometimes that love doesn't last and the developer finds a 
new ticket that looks prettier. I know that out of your list, I'll never 
touch the comments nor admin sections nor the i18n tickets. They just 
aren't sexy enough.

So I mean, I've gained a lot of respect for a lot of people this past 
week and good job all you damn sexy testers/ticket reviewers/devs!

The whole point of the timelines was to nudge us along and get releases out.
By not having a set date, we risk dragging on forever.

There is one guy working on a simple (well, simple for the user) for 
adding tags, however there are plugins that manage tags. Other than 
that, I'm not sure. There are tickets.

Yeah Christine http://www.neato.co.nz/wordpress-things/tag-managing-thing

This is nice work. But I often scratch my head and wonder why this is  
not in WP core. Since category management is.

Oh yeah, I know... =D I guess with this "one" (2.4), with all that was 
planned to get in "it" and then also having those 500 some tickets 
there, that were originally planned for two to four versions 
previously... Kinda makes one feel like... "Crap, all this stuff... so 
little time, oh well.. if we don't get it all in this time, maybe the 
next time eh?"

Next time rolls around.. instead of having 500 some tickets, there's 600 
to 700 with even more better stuff planned to get in the next version 
(2.5) ... then cycle repeats again for 2.6.. or whatever... Basically 
was just saying... maybe (if need be)... take a version and get what you 
can get done with it, and not really worry too much if it goes over the 
"expected release date" for some catching up...

I mean, don't do this all the time... but maybe some times, to help cut 
down on the backlog in Trac and or whatever else that comes up later 
down the road for "new features" that were voted to go into core... So 
"we're" not always getting behind... Take some time through version 
releases to catch up too. Not just slap more into core, while leaving 
more slug trail goop behind at same time..

Yes, that was my thought Paul.  Why not have a "Tags" tab under
"Manage"?

Couldn't have picked a better place for it! I agree with you all! Let's 
do it! I think this was one of the things that was originally 
(supposedly) planned for 2.4 as well as the admin redesign.. =D

I agree with you totally on this. I've seen that happen more than once 
too. People go there, drop a ticket and take off... Then everyone else 
is left scratching their heads... I admit, I can't really say much 
though because I rarely have the time to go there to Trac to help or 
whatever sigh. I haven't been having all this wonderful internet time 
like I had before and it sucks. Cause I really miss helping out on the 
forums, Trac, and where ever else...

But when I find/have the time...I try and do it full force while I'm 
here and can... The whole deal with people dropping tickets and running 
is a sad shame, because it doesn't help anyone at all. The original 
ticket submitter jets off... then the others have to figure out how or 
what to do with "it". Most times those tickets just sit there, which 
doesn't help a thing.

I've only submitted a few tickets in my day, and they were basically 
easy ones because I'm not a PHP coder. Hence for me not doing up more 
patches for tickets.. I'd love to PHP code and help create patches and 
etc, but I just don't have that knowledge currently because of lack of 
time to learn the PHP code... =( But yeah, the tickets need more TLC. 
And not just from the rest of the users that come across it, but from 
the original ticket submitters as well.

That's basically why I suggested this earlier:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-December/016738.html

Sure, it's a task in itself... Means they'd have to hack/edit Trac 
software itself to do what needs to be done. But, at least the tickets 
wouldn't constantly be bumping from version to version or whatever 
else.. The tickets would SIT THERE in the "TICKET BIN", assigned to 
their respected Milestone Bins. They wouldn't need to go any where 
UNLESS the ones with "SVN Commit Rights" MOVES them to the Milestone 
it's intended for...

So when looking at the RoadMap page there... there wouldn't be 500+ 
tickets sitting under Milestone 2.4... There'd only be what was sent 
there from bin.. that the SVN Committers moved there from "Ticket Bin". 
This would help alot too, for like.. setting a certain amount of tickets 
to be applied to that Milestone for under a certain Release Date 
schedule. So you don't have to constantly bump tickets from like: 2.4 to 
2.5 then those same tickets get bumped from 2.5 to 2.6 or whatever...

All those (uncertain with what to do with) type tickets can remain in 
the Ticket Bin, out of the way, and be there to be able to decide on 
it's destination later. And if need be, and they think it would be best 
in another version bin.. they could just move it from 2.4 milestone bin 
to the next one...

Unless I used the wrong wording, I basically said it would be better to 
knock out simpler tickets when "you" can... =P Especially when waiting 
around on whether the Admin Redesign is coming in or not... While the 
"wait" is there for the BIG stuff... they my as well knock out or squash 
the simple stuff quick... I wrote this in previous email: "And what 
better to knock out first, than the simpler tickets... Especially with 
an Admin redesign coming soon, you can only touch so much tickets 
without interfering with it.. I know I pointed out SOME tickets that 
were pending on the Admin redesign... but they were also planned for 2.4 
though, as well as the Admin redesign stuff... "

Yeah. And it's a sad shame that something like this one is taking 
forever to figure out what to do with it too..
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4754

It's like.. "Uh, make up the mind people... It's not that hard to figure 
out what's the best wording/grammar usage to use for a logout message... 
" Take the suggestion that gets more +1 votes and commit it to core, 
close and go to next one... "oh boy, we're down to 542 tickets from 543 
a few minutes ago..LOL!" At least it's one less to worry about.. ;) :D I 
think most of the time they choose to let the simple ones linger till 
last minute.. just to get at "us"... :P lmao...

That's true too. And I wouldn't touch those tickets either, other than 
to maybe comment on them and give my suggestions, opinions, and such.. I 
guess, just in my eyes they SEEM simple enough. And or, ones that 
shouldn't take but a quick decision of what to do with them... Commit 
it, Finish it, or Forget it (delete it)...

The idea I believe was rather than picking a particular type of interface,
let plugin authors come up with their own and then seeing what was popular
before integrating one into the core.

The whole behind-the-scenes stuff is in place, there's just no GUI.

Well, I should have made clear that some of the submitters probably 
wandered off after there was no traction after a certain period of time, 
"Hello, anyone home?" I think with a recent example, once it was made 
clear that the reporter had to clarify, the reporter came back and did 
so, which lead to a resolution. With a year past, I'm not sure the 
original reporter might still be interested in WordPress. I know in a 
year time, whatever ticket I have created and not committed will 
probably have no involvement from me until I once again came back to 
WordPress.

Well, in that, I mean part of the reason there are 500+ tickets is 
because there isn't a lot of love, which until recently a lot of love 
that should have went was not. It is a tough decision to close a ticket, 
because it leaves you to wonder if anyone else will show up to resubmit 
the bug. Some of the bugs might be edge cases, which may never show up 
until a unit test or acceptance test is written that finds it again (I 
keep forgetting the guy that writes those). You take the risk closing 
out old bugs and alienating the bug poster, "WTF? That bug still causes 
me nightmares!"

I disagreed with your proposal, and I don't know if I replied to say 
that. The good news is that the next version of Trac (0.11) is going to 
have a workflow that might allow for a little of what you say, in that 
you can create more statuses, such as "confirmed" status in that someone 
tested and confirmed. Really, I think your proposal would create more 
work and more red tape to go through to get bugs committed. The current 
rule/suggestion that if a ticket doesn't have a patch, then it belongs 
in the next milestone is a good one. If you want to show a ticket some 
love and write a patch, then those that do can bring that patch down the 
trunk milestone.

This would keep the trunk milestone with a few tickets that have patches 
and therefore should be debated and committed and all others will exist 
in the next milestone. However, I'm not sure how far the core devs are 
going to take this. It would be much better if someone would adopt a 
ticket and supply a patch for it.

I suppose my point has always been that there is only so much the core 
devs can do and should do. I don't believe they can provide a patch for 
every 500+ bug, it is a community effort, but really if the community 
doesn't care for a bug then that bug will remain until it is superseded 
or obsoleted. In the best case, every week would be like this last week 
and WordPress milestones wouldn't contain such a large amount of old bugs.

However, I think that most popular open source projects might wish for 
having only 500-600 open bugs. I'm not sure how I feel about closing out 
bugs just because there is no current love for them. Someone might come 
along later and the bug will peak their curiosity and that bug will 
exist no longer in open state. Basically in some ways, bug hunts are 
good to refresh peoples memories of bugs that once knew and reclaim old 
friends, "Dude, I so totally remember that bug, whatever happened? Let 
me take care of you."

Hmm, I had thought that was what you meant, but didn't quite know how to 
word my assertion. Please excuse my earlier statement.


May I suggest, since you don't know that much of PHP, that you become 
involve with automated testing. You really only need to know the PHPUnit 
methods (there is a great resource phpunit.de and you can copy/refactor 
the current tests to your needs), in that way you learn PHP, and 
seriously help the community. I'm probably going to jump onto the codex 
and write up a tutorial on helping the automated tests test writing 
since that needs to have as many people/testers as possible.

At the very basic, regression testing involves var_dump()-ing functions 
with test input (both correct and *incorrect*[1]) and using var_dump() 
on the output. Once you figured out what the function dumps upon given 
input, you can then use the PHPUnit $this->assert*() methods to make 
sure that whatever input is given is continued to be given, else a 
regression bug occurred.

That is probably the quickest and easiest automated testing. It doesn't 
drill down into the core of the functions and test all the possible 
branches the function can take, but still, if the regression test 
failed, then somewhere out there, there is a function/plugin/theme that 
is going to break based on the change.

The best thing would be for more unit tests, since it would prove the 
low level testing of a bug and possible fixes for correcting that bug. 
The best part about regression/acceptance tests is that they can be 
written by non-developers and most of the articles I've read recommend 
that they aren't written by developers.

[1] With unit testing or any kind of testing you are purposefully trying 
to break the software. If I enter "-1" instead of a positive number, 
will I break the functionality? In that, you want to write 
unit/functional/acceptance tests with both correct and incorrect input 
and still expect correct output or some fallback value which states that 
you need to enter correct input (acceptable response, meaning the 
function was aware that incorrect input was passed and had checks to 
insure that it would not continue). However, I don't think I've taken my 
own advice since I've tested mostly correct input instead of the latter 
in most cases because well, with regressions, you aren't really trying 
to break the function, just trying to see what it returns. Most of my 
tests would fall in to the regression testing with the plugin in line 
with unit testing.

Just curious, is there any chance of having previews of the new Admin 
design? Or, is this going to be one of those "SURPRISE!! Here it is!!" 
moments...? lol. I'm going to go with a "surprise moment" guess here, 
because if everyone seen a preview before it makes it in trunk... it 
might spark debates and such.. =P

Okay, maybe I should read into things a little bit, =). Meh. The newer
version of the Codex is a lot better, I can actually find the edit button
for pages now... Neat! Thanks Barry.

Quick question: is the login integrated with the forums? If not, do you 
think it's possible to set this up? I'm sure I've seen an extension for 
MediaWiki for this somewhere...

Thanks,
Ryan.

There's not much to look at right now aside from a glimpse at the new

Please don't write bugs yet.  There are still many more commits to
come.  There will be a bad case of the unstyled uglies in the
meantime.

I can't get my local SVN copy to load.  What's this "secret key"
business about in the wp-config?

Ah, it begins.  The colors are not going to change.  Everyone have fun
discussing their personal color preferences though.  :-)

This is like when the phpBB team first committed the new skin to CVS. It 
was horrible, broken, and people revolted, but it all turned out nice. I 
just hope this one doesn't take seven years to get right!

Well colours could be chamged adding an hook to have a plugin that add
a css after the default one that override the colour scheme. And well
yes I dont' like it, but iI'm not going to question about this... if
new design improve the usability iI personally don't care what color
are used... it's the backend not the frontend..

To be honest, I like it. It is a lot better than the current layout! I really hope that it looks better than the current (2.3) layout and not just a re-colour though.

Will any mockups of the new design be available for us to take a look at
before all of the commits have been added? It would be nice to see how the
finished design will look like :)

Hmm, not bad so far. Nice change of pace.

Plus, the real thing that should matter to you guys is the layout, not
colors. Colors are very easily changed by plugins, layout is a lot harder.

Is it just a skin / visual redesign? Or will the UI change? I was  
expecting / hoping that the placement of things conceptually would  
evolve. That we'd get some kind of whole new way of organizing the  
back-end that would be easier for my non-techie clients to understand.

But that screenshot someone posted makes it seem like the layout /  
UI / organization of the tools is going to stay the same, and simply  
get a fresh look.

It would be handy to know which to expect, since I'm working with a  
team of people right now who are developing screen-cast wordpress  
tutorials. We've been holding off, expecting the 2.4 redesign.

thanks,
Jen

>From what I understand it's going to be a big re-organization of the admin
panel, it's why a lot of patches for the backend have been postponed until
the new layout etc. is done.

As Ryan pointed out earlier: "There are still many more commits to come."

Which suggests more than just a new paint job :P

It'd be better to see it go all the way to the right of the window, though.

Now's a good time to get rid of the BrowseHappy logo. :P It sorta ruins the
look of the footer, because the footer isn't at the very bottom...

Heh.  Sounds like a localization problem

I just got home and did a "svn up" on the blogs. It's looking pretty 
nice so far, can't wait to see what else comes then... =)  (Change is a 
good thing!!)

Hey all,

I just submitted a couple WPMU patches (one for trunk and one for the
1.3 tag) porting the changes Ryan made in WP to address the cookie
authentication and password salting issues.

Seems to be running fine on my WPMU installs so far. I'll keep up with
the progress on these and try to keep MU in sync as progress is made.

See standard WP Trac ticket #5367 for details. [1]

See WPMU Ticket #528 for patches. [2]

Indeed. It would be nice if WP didn't make the Microsoft error of thinking
that English = US English.

Pls change `Howdy` in the next release.

I hate the phrase 'English (United States)' when, in truth, English
originated in England, hence it's name. So really it should be American
'(United States)' and 'English (United Kingdom)' or just 'English' will do.

Regarding the 'Howdy' complaints people are having, perhaps the best
compromise would be to provide a hook to allow for localization.

Also, does 'Howdy' change with each different language anyway? So, 'Bonjour'
instead of 'Howdy' in the French translation. Or is it 'Howdy' for everyone?

Seriously, folks, there are a couple things more important than this.
Adding filters and hooks everywhere is not speeding things up, let's
avoid unnecessary stuff.
If you're really this annoyed by it, make a plugin with
jQuery('#user_info p').html().replace(/Howdy/,'Hello'), modify your
translation .po file, or whatever. Since Matt said that Howdy won't
change, why continue on this topic ?

It's printf(__('Howdy, <strong>%s</strong>.') so yes, it's translated.

I was going to make a plugin to allow simpler customization of Howdy,
for example, random greetings from around the world.  I haven't gotten
around to that part though.  I did come up with a code snippet that
changes the text without having to deal with .PO files, etc.  I
haven't tested it in a while, but here it is:

add_action('admin_head', 'scompt_add_gettext');
function scompt_add_gettext() {
    add_filter( 'gettext', 'scompt_gettext', 10, 2);
}
function scompt_gettext($translated, $text) {
    if( $text == 'Howdy, <strong>%s</strong>.' ) {
        remove_filter('gettext', 'scompt_gettext', 10, 2);
        return "woohoo, <strong>%s</strong>";
    }
    return $translated;
}

The scompt_gettext filter is added in the admin_head action and
removed after being used once to keep the work performed to a minimum.

Toss it in your functions.php, say goodbye to Howdy.

But why changing is such difficult?


Howard?

In case it's not obvious to non-U.S. users, just wanted to say that we  
don't go around saying "Howdy" to each other in the U.S. When  
Americans hear "Howdy," we think "Old time cowboy" or "1950s western."  
Howdy as a  greeting is NOT common in the U.S., and is usually used in  
a tongue-in-cheek sort of way. So it seems odd to see all these people  
calling it U.S.-centric.

I'm not arguing against making it localizable - just saying that I  
don't think Matt's insisting on it is as U.S.-centric as it may look.  
It's just a small bit of fun, and it does a good job of showing that  
WP doesn't take itself so seriously that it can't have a bit of fun.

Plus, as Ozh pointed out, it can already be addressed with
localization the same way most of the other text in WP can.

Therefore, if it truly is a localization "issue", it has already
fixed. Let's move on.

I think the point people have is that it's a "bit of fun" that doesn't
actually translate too well into non-US English to native English
speakers, never mind anyone else. This may not be apparent to speakers of
US English, hence the suggestions from speakers of other varieties of
English that it's US-centric.

To me, it seems odd that people in the US think it's odd that people
outside the US see something so definitively USian as US-centric.

But as changing it is essentially trivial, it's not really a big deal, so
I'll shut up about it now...

Yeah, that happens often. Would be nice to maybe have some type of time 
period "email notifier", which the user could check a box for... Example:

** Get notified of replies to your ticket after: **

a) few days
b) few weeks
c) few months
d) few whatever else..

SO, if the user hasn't been checking up their own tickets for some 
reason (maybe too busy to) .. they would have a reminder there to do 
so... There should also be a statement some where that lets the user(s) 
know, that not all tickets will be considered nor submitted. Maybe there 
is that statement some where, I just overlooked it..?

Yeah, I agree with this as well. Perhaps putting "our" 
wives/girlfriends/boyfriends/husbands (whatever) on "dry dock", and take 
a few more nights a week giving some love-ins to Tract tickets would 
help... LoL

It's okay that you disagree. =) Actually, I wasn't trying to demand the 
proposal as such, just was throwing out thoughts, suggestions, and 
opinions. At least I feel better getting those out on the table though. =)

I see what you're saying here. I was just viewing it from the 
prospective of "wow, sure would be nice to keep all the tickets in ONE 
place, until they were chosen for a specific Milestone. Rather then 
constantly bumping them from Milestone to Milestone".

I know that they would have to get moved or bumped anyway though. After 
taking a break from this discussion, I realized it would be more "work" 
to just make a "BIN" and rewrite Trac. And it would also require moving 
the tickets to the "BIN".. then go back again later to move tickets from 
BIN to be under a Milestone.. (Said that, If the proposal was done that is.)

And yes, the core developers can't always create patches for all the 
tickets either. Nor do they have the time to be able to handle every 
single ticket before a release. It IS a community project, not just the 
core developers project. The "testers" are always going to out-number 
the amount of developers, and the amount of testers that don't know how 
to create patches, nor code to be able to make a patch is always going 
to exist too.

I know there are Bug Hunts and etc, but I wonder if "we" could some how 
maybe get the Community attention more on Trac? I know the Community 
knows of Trac, but I mean... some how constantly remind the public to 
help out there, get MORE people to help out and submit patches and etc. 
And I'm not talking about just the regulars that go to Trac. I'm talking 
about branching out and spreading the word where ever "we" can... Would 
be awesome if "we" could have a constant big flow of helpers, rather 
then just a designated day for "Bug Hunt"... Perhaps I'm dreaming, I 
guess someone should pinch me ...  =P

I'll have to look into this then. I just don't have the time like I used

I don't quite get it. WPMU stays in sync with WP anyway, so the WPMU
version released after WP 2.4 is released will have the new hashing
functionality anyway.

That may be, but I'd like to have those security issues plugged
sooner. I was just throwing this out there for anyone who may want the
same, while they wait for the next version. If anyone would rather
wait for the version release, they're welcome to.

On a related note, since the admin reworking is being checked into the
WP trunk now, I'd guess that will probably have an impact on the next
WPMU release date, if the plan is still to keep them in sync
feature-wise.

Someone may have already mentioned this on here (since I haven't read
every thread recently), but it seems to be pretty close to the release
date for those kind of changes to be going in, but I admittedly am not
familiar with the nature of the admin changes, so maybe it's not as
big a deal as I'm thinking.

Either way, all this patch was is an early sync (from WP to WPMU) of
just these two specific security patches (using Ryan's code line for
line), and I'd just rather use those while I wait for the next
release.

I know that there are a lot of people with MU installations (with lots
of users) who are feeling vulnerable, so I just wanted to get that out
there early. Didn't mean to step on anyone's toes there; sorry if
that's how it came across.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Improved Ozh WordPress Version Info Tool
Message-ID: <476F1F10.6040400@santosj.name>

After two days, I've completed a version of Ozh tool that improves on 
the information and supplies information for constants, globals [1], 
functions, methods, classes, and properties. The tool is an attempt to 
improve the @since tags in WordPress inline documentation.

I'm not ready to give up the source and URL yet, but expect to hear 
something after Christmas.

Ozh's sexy tool just got sexier.

The code will be posted for anyone that wants to take a look at the 
tokenizer and regular expression code. Just need a few more days to test 
it out and do some other things.

[1] Tokenizer is a bitch. Complete and straight up bitch. In the 
prototype, I started to create a blacklist, but soon realized that a 
white list would be a better approach. In that attempt, I found that 
false positives for globals were being created and not relying on the 
block level code. Therefore the globals are strict global variables with 
the syntax "global $var1, $var2, ...;". Another way of putting it is 
that even through top level variables are technically globals, they 
aren't going to be included in the list unless a function uses them.

Howdy Pilgrims,

This discussion _is_ polluting the list because it consists of nothing
more than an argument. If you want to put forward your case then do so
by including reason and consequence. An example of this would be where
you append the word "because" to the end of your sentence and then
follow it with more than two words.

Or lighten up a bit.

Reasons have been put forth. "Howdy" is hardly British English -- it's
strictly an American euphemism, and even then it's only used in the south.
To be honest, I could care less, but there is actually some reasoning going
on here.

I'm subscribed to the WP-Trac mailing list, and find the coloured Diffs to be great.

I however would like to make a suggestion..

Is it somehow possible to make the Ticket number a link?
Eg, in this, #5306 would link to the ticket

Log Message
set_auth_cookie action. see #5367

The Revision number might also be a useful link for quick web references without having to type the URL's out.

I'm not how easy it would be to accomplish it, But do think it'd be usefull.

wp-svn use SVN::Notify (from the headers).

It looks like that some extra parameters would need adding to the call
for it to make the ticket nos a link.

http://search.cpan.org/dist/SVN-Notify/bin/svnnotify

- --ticket-map REGEX=URL    Regex and URL for custom ticket identifiers.
- -U --revision-url URL        Include links to specified Revision URL.

I got it! Had to hack around a bit, but now revision numbers and tickets 
should be linked in [wp-svn] in the future. Here's the line in 
post-commit I ended up with:

/usr/local/bin/svnnotify -r $REV -C -d -H HTML::ColorDiff -p $REPOS -t 
wp-svn@lists.automattic.com --from m@wordpress.org --reply-to 
wp-hackers@lists.automattic.com --revision-url 
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/%s --ticket-map 
'(#(\d+))=http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/%s' --ticket-regex 
'(\[(\d+)\])' --ticket-url http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/%s

The --revision-url links the number at top. ticket-map is the new way in 
2.66 (I had to upgrade) to do ticket linking, the double parens are so 
it doesn't strip the # part. The last bits, ticket-regex and ticket-url, 
are both deprecated arguments but I found I could use them to link 
[1234] to the appropiate changeset page, same thing with the 
double-parens. So now the messages should look as nice as they do in Trac:

Come on guys, it's just a lighthearted greeting for users. As it's been
pointed out earlier, the phrase is not really used in the US anyway, it's
like saying "Good day Old Chap" in England; so no it's not British English,
but does that matter? Who spends much time dwelling over one word in the
header of their admin panel?

However, if people really want this changed then as described previously by
many different people it can be done pretty easily.

Please, someone make a plugin for this and let's move on?
Hell, I might make this my first plugin and write it up over Christmas Day!

Not at all ? I misunderstood your intentions.

I tend to agree with you. A large blog host should be keeping its users
passwords as securely as possible, and a backport seems to be the only
way to get this done quickly.

I was finally able to finish and fix the last known bug. If anyone wants 
a preview it, they can download the package [1] and either upload it to 
their host or use it with any AMP installation. It should run on PHP 4, 
but I have not tested it with PHP4. I will not support PHP4. The pages 
can be slow, very slow depending on if you go to the fulllist.php or 
just index.php. Dependent on wordpress.save. Using the API, you should 
be able to build an importer for adding the information to a database or 
to WordPress.

Thanks you Ozh for the inspiration!

Oh yeah. Does not include the tokenizer code, just has the display. The 
code is dual licensed BSD and GPLv3, but you can whatever you want. 
Still considered a work in progress, let me know if any classes did not 
come out right.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress DocBook err, Book
Message-ID: <47706A64.9040509@santosj.name>

I think one person pointed out that there could be better documentation 
besides the incredibility awesome WordPress codex. However, the 
alternative is known as DocBook and it isn't quite as easy as clicking 
edit and typing wiki markup. The markup for DocBook is quite a bit more 
complex. However, there is a light shining at the end of the tunnel. 
Some applications are available for free that allow for Word/Open 
Office/Notepad style editing of DocBook books.

I've thought about it and I really don't have the time to expend on 
copying the text and playing the role of editor as to how best to apply 
it a book. To be honest, I'm not sure on the copyright issues that doing 
so which might come up. There is a lot of text and editing the better 
parts into more coherent form.

The advantages of docbook, since it is plaintext and available for 
download is that it is translatable. In that, there is a form of help 
that is searchable, translatable, and would provide a highly condensed 
version of help. However, it is unknown how many people would be up to 
translating the whole of the finished docbook.

The second advantage is that there will always be a docbook help version 
available for the version of WordPress. So in theory, you could bundle 
the docbook in with the application or have the various docbooks for the 
WordPress versions online. Also, you would only have to update the parts 
that changed. Most of the time you update the parts that changed and add 
parts that were added in the new version.

You can have an user guide and a developers guide. The end user guide 
can detail with pictures that in the administration, as well as how to 
add comments, and what various options do. The developer guide could 
give the various information on the hooks, template tags, how to write a 
plugin, and other core information.

Besides the possible copyright issues with taking from the WordPress 
codex, it would be take quite a while to write something completely 
absent of any text from the codex. I've been thinking about this and it 
could be quite fun. Given the relative complexity of the markup and 
building, it would be unlikely to replace the codex. It would be a nice 
supplement.

However this should probably be cross posted to wp-docs, I'm not 
subscribed to that mailing list. Just posting to see if anyone would be 
interested in something like this and if what license the codex is.

Some months ago, I believe it was Lloyd who said that GPLv3 was a
matter of wait and watch (what others so). With maturity and high
adoption (over 1,300 projects now), will it not be reasonable for
WordPress to upgrade to GPLv3? I am just asking. There is nothing to
be lost and the benefit is a defensive one as well as a perceptual
one. From a programmer's (or "hacker's") point of view, this would
also resolve compatibility issues (c/f
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/144778 ).

Merry Christmas/happy holidays to all.

Submitting patches and bug reports probably shouldn't expect a reply

That is an sexy tree, much better than the one I have at home.

There should be no incompatibility for a theme to be GPLv3 while
WordPress is GPLv2.  What incompatibility do you see?

Hi Kimmo,

I used this URL as an example of the fact that some projects are
gradually shifting, but it wasn't an example of an incompatibility
(just something to confer with).

There are some large projects that chose the new licence (e.g.
Funambol, SugarCRM, even some questions arising about KDE) and since
some of these as SaaS, WordPress codebase might be worth combining at
one stage or another. IANAL, but issues that surround Tivoization --
unlike themes -- have an impact. I also wonder what Automattic knows
about software patents from companies like Blackboard. The USPTO is
kind of deluded, but it doesn't change the fact that it's worth
thinking ahead.

Best wishes,

Roy

I am very much against the GPLv3 in general, and its application to
WordPress in specific. I do not and will not use GPLv3 software in any
way for any of my work related projects because the GPLv3 poses a much
greater liability risk than GPLv2 software does.

So I would recommend that extremely serious thought be put into any
attempts by the community in general and Automattic in specific before
attempting to convert WordPress to the GPLv3. There are serious
compatibility issues (the GPLv3 is far, far less compatible than the
GPLv2 is with many other forms of licensing), as well as serious
consequences with regards to use (I am not the only company that has
forbidden all use of any GPLv3 software due to the extreme legal
issues).

The GPLv3 is, in my opinion, a travesty. It is neither necessary nor
desirable, and frankly, the FSF has lost my support in everything is
does because of their insane adherence to it.

Could you substantiate this for the benefit of those of us who have
not the same knowledge that you possess? I'm trying to form an opinion
and I want to understand your disdain for GPLv3.

Some guy called Stallman seems to think you disagree with the goal of the GPL:

"There will be people who will ask you not to do so. A minority of our
community seems to be very angry about GPL version 3. And, when we try
to probe to find out their motives, it usually turns out that they
disagree with the goal of the GNU GPL, the goal of guaranteeing
freedom for every user. Please, when people who hold those views ask
you to leave users' freedom vulnerable, don't listen to them. Defend
the user's freedom, that's important. And even if they are people who
ask us not to do it, we've got to do it. We have to defend the user's
freedom against these threats." [2]

Is he wrong? He has a katana [1] so I am inclined to follow his
advice. What do you have?

Decided I needed a little exercise:

<http://striderweb.com/wp-content/docs/nerd/downloads/howdy-dont.zip>

Now it's a plugin.  Knock yerselves out.  Option page and everything.

I do have a question.  Since the filter only works when there is a  
localization file in use, I wanted to make it so the Options page  
only appears under the same condition.  I tried the following:

function howdy_load_optionspage() {
	global $l10n;
	if( isset( $l10n[$domain] ) ) {
		add_options_page( "Howdy Don't", "Howdy Don't", 'manage_options',  
basename(__FILE__), 'howdy_options_page');
	}
}

But for some reason the if( isset() ) always results in "false".  I  
copied that test straight out of the l10n.php file from core.  Any  
idea why it doesn't work here?

Regards,
Stephen

In your code, it looks like $domain is undefined.

Correct.  But the exact same test in l10n.php returns true, as  
evidenced by the fact that the text gets translated.  How does if 
( isset( $l10n[$domain] ) ) return true one moment and moments later  
return false?

My disdain for the GPLv3 is that it attempts to solve problems which
do not exist, and in so doing, it puts the freedoms of the users above
the freedoms of the developers, who are also users, but ones that they
discount.

Consider the so-called problem of so-called "Tivoization". If you
don't know the background here, I'll explain it. Tivo boxes use a
modified copy of the Linux kernel. Tivo followed the GPL to the letter
and released all their code changes ( http://www.tivo.com/linux/ ).
However, after the Tivo hacking started, they modified the code in
their actual hardware to check for a signature on the copy of the
kernel before booting it. This was to protect them and their service,
they didn't want people hacking the boxes in ways such that they did
not require the Tivo service. In other words, Tivo boxes can only run
kernels actually signed by Tivo.

Somehow this offended Stallman and the FSF. They think that the user
should be free to modify the code on the purchased hardware, despite
the fact that the hardware is not actually end-user modifiable by
normal people (just hackers) and also despite the fact that Tivo was
selling the boxes at a loss.

And that is Tivoization. Wrapping the code into a black box that can't
be modified.

What Stallman and crew are failing to see is that there's nothing
wrong with this. Tivo isn't selling hardware. Tivo is selling a
service. They leveraged open source code to create this service, and
they created an unopenable black box using that code. They released
their changes to that code back to the public, and anybody else who
wants to do so can create their own hardware and run Tivo's changes.
In other words, the GPL fulfilled its function, the changes were given
back. Tivo's only "crime" was in doing the razor blade service idea
and then trying to protect themselves from unscrupulous people.

> Some guy called Stallman seems to think you disagree with the goal of the GPL:

Yes, I absolutely disagree with Stallman and virtually everything he
says nowadays. He's gone from genius to socialist zealot.

The goal of the GPL, in my opinion, was to preserve freedom by keeping
what was released under it free for all to see and use. When the code
is free, everybody benefits. You can all use the code. You can all
modify the code. If you modify it and sell it, you have to give those
modifications back. Tivo did this. Hell, I've done this.

However, this freedom does NOT give you the freedom to take advantage
of other people's schemes. This does NOT give you the freedom to steal
service. This absolutely does not give you the freedom to set terms on
USE of that code. The GPLv2 focused entirely on redistribution. If I
redistribute the code, then I have to give away my changes. The GPLv3
adds a new one. Now, if I redistribute that code in a product, I have
to not only make the changes available, but I have to let the end-user
modify the product. I cannot protect my product and my business plan
through technical measures. I cannot give away razors while trying to
sell razor blades.

In other words, I cannot use GPLv3 code in any sort of actual
non-end-user-modifiable product that I sell. If I use GPLv3 code, I
must take extra steps to make the product modifiable by end-users.

And why? Because Stallman and the FSF think that's a good idea? Yes, I
disagree with them. I do not think that it is a good idea. I think
it's restrictive of freedoms for the developer. I want to use the open
source code to create new cool products, but this sort of ridiculous
restriction only limits the use. It takes away the freedoms of the
developer. It is far, far less free than the GPLv2 was.

> Is he wrong?

Yes. Richard Stallman is absolutely, 100% wrong in everything he has
said for at least the last 3 years. He can no longer be trusted on any
subject of any kind.

When it's not in scope? Try changing your

global $l10n;

to

global $l10n, $domain;

The difference is that  in the other example, $domain is passed in as
a function argument.

You know, I started to reply earlier, and my sentence (and I quote) is
almost the same as your opening statement :)
"The problem with GPL v3 is that it gives extra rights to users, but in
exchange puts additional burdens on developers."

Like you said - that's all the problem now. When I write open source code,
I'm choosing more and more to steer away from GPL because I find it makes
life harder for me as a developer rather than easier.

Look at most linux distros - in an attempt to protect the "integrity" of
open source, you can't distribute open source with free source (in FSF's
*INTERPRETATION* of the GPL and not the word of the GPL) so Linux distros
force users to manually "unlock" drivers and codecs which is one of the
biggest things that newbies don't understand: "Why doesn't it work out of
the box?"

Sure, it preserves the code - but in doing so, it places additional burdens
and restrictions on the _developer_ instead, which is just bull.

GPLv2 had the huge distinction between "the letter of" and "the spirit of"
the GPL - but for those of us developers disinclined to follow the FSF's
developer-limiting spirit, we could still take advantage of the GPLv2 as a
license that protects both our rights as developers AND our user's freedoms.

With the GPLv3, the FSF tried to do away with the separation between letter
and spirit - which was a wholly unnecessary and totalitarian move.

Basically: GPLv2 gives developers more freedom _and doesn't start off with
the assumption that all developers are evil, greedy bastards who just want
to take GPL'd code and make money off of it_ whereas the GPLv3 limits
developer's rights and makes that ridiculous assumption.

There is nothing to be gained by moving from GPLv2 to GPLv3 except trading
the right to interpret open source in the way that best suites the community
in exchange for the FSF's interpretation of those rights.

I have yet to see a compelling argument to get developers to switch TO the
GPLv3 - and when you say it'll make your code fully compatible with people
already using the GPLv3; well, perhaps they should consider switching back
to v2 and saving face.

My disdain for the GPLv3 is that it attempts to solve problems which
do not exist, and in so doing, it puts the freedoms of the users above
the freedoms of the developers, who are also users, but ones that they
discount.

Consider the so-called problem of so-called "Tivoization". If you
don't know the background here, I'll explain it. Tivo boxes use a
modified copy of the Linux kernel. Tivo followed the GPL to the letter
and released all their code changes ( http://www.tivo.com/linux/ ).
However, after the Tivo hacking started, they modified the code in
their actual hardware to check for a signature on the copy of the
kernel before booting it. This was to protect them and their service,
they didn't want people hacking the boxes in ways such that they did
not require the Tivo service. In other words, Tivo boxes can only run
kernels actually signed by Tivo.

Somehow this offended Stallman and the FSF. They think that the user
should be free to modify the code on the purchased hardware, despite
the fact that the hardware is not actually end-user modifiable by
normal people (just hackers) and also despite the fact that Tivo was
selling the boxes at a loss.

And that is Tivoization. Wrapping the code into a black box that can't
be modified.

What Stallman and crew are failing to see is that there's nothing
wrong with this. Tivo isn't selling hardware. Tivo is selling a
service. They leveraged open source code to create this service, and
they created an unopenable black box using that code. They released
their changes to that code back to the public, and anybody else who
wants to do so can create their own hardware and run Tivo's changes.
In other words, the GPL fulfilled its function, the changes were given
back. Tivo's only "crime" was in doing the razor blade service idea
and then trying to protect themselves from unscrupulous people.

> Some guy called Stallman seems to think you disagree with the goal of the
GPL:

Yes, I absolutely disagree with Stallman and virtually everything he
says nowadays. He's gone from genius to socialist zealot.

The goal of the GPL, in my opinion, was to preserve freedom by keeping
what was released under it free for all to see and use. When the code
is free, everybody benefits. You can all use the code. You can all
modify the code. If you modify it and sell it, you have to give those
modifications back. Tivo did this. Hell, I've done this.

However, this freedom does NOT give you the freedom to take advantage
of other people's schemes. This does NOT give you the freedom to steal
service. This absolutely does not give you the freedom to set terms on
USE of that code. The GPLv2 focused entirely on redistribution. If I
redistribute the code, then I have to give away my changes. The GPLv3
adds a new one. Now, if I redistribute that code in a product, I have
to not only make the changes available, but I have to let the end-user
modify the product. I cannot protect my product and my business plan
through technical measures. I cannot give away razors while trying to
sell razor blades.

In other words, I cannot use GPLv3 code in any sort of actual
non-end-user-modifiable product that I sell. If I use GPLv3 code, I
must take extra steps to make the product modifiable by end-users.

And why? Because Stallman and the FSF think that's a good idea? Yes, I
disagree with them. I do not think that it is a good idea. I think
it's restrictive of freedoms for the developer. I want to use the open
source code to create new cool products, but this sort of ridiculous
restriction only limits the use. It takes away the freedoms of the
developer. It is far, far less free than the GPLv2 was.

> Is he wrong?

Yes. Richard Stallman is absolutely, 100% wrong in everything he has
said for at least the last 3 years. He can no longer be trusted on any
subject of any kind.

Hi,

>> and I want to understand your disdain for GPLv3.

A great deal of resentment came from a variety of lobbying arms and even
academic researchers who were secretly paid by those who would suffer
the most from wide adoption of the GNU GPLv3. You are strongly
encouraged to listen to those who haven't vested interest and those
whose mind has not been 'poisoned' by the coordinated smear campaign. I
urge you to judge things for yourself rather than rely on mouth-to-hear
disinformation. The origins of misinformation are well known, but that's
a separate (and very long) story. I will gladly go into it if you are
interested.

This assessment is shockingly selective. Have you witnessed a variety of
threats and lawsuits whose target is distributors of Free open source
software? That happens to include companies that deploy software like
WordPress. Have you followed the Moodle situation recently? Has the
involvement of the FSF (and its sister organisations), namely that of
protecting the project, escaped your attention? I ask this politely
because I will gladly elaborate shall that be needed.

The raison detre of the GPL is to sustain the freedom of software, which
has been jeopardized by legalisation of software patents in a few parts
of the world. The GPLv3 addresses several issues, of which this is one.

Tivoization, as it is used by Tivo, might be a practical solution that
even Linus Torvalds has endorsed. Tivoization, however, is a loophole,
which can be further misused in the future. It represents a feature to
some, but it is also a weakness. Imagine a scenario which involves not
the razor blade analogy, but one which involved locking down one's
machine for the purpose of control, eavesdropping, and so forth. Have
you heard about IBM prototyping Trusted Computing for GNU/Linux?

What if an installation of a CMS ever forbade you from changing its
behaviour, essentially leaving you imprisoned by a highly undesirable
set of constraints? What does that mean to free software? Hardware can
be used to limit use and to impose limits on modification. That hardware
could, for instance, be Blade servers (no pun w.r.t. razor blazes intended).

The box is not just modifiable by hackers, but it is seen as
*programmable* to just a few. End-users can alter the behaviour of the
box given an alternative pre-prepared image (reflashing, patching, et
cetera). One of the issues that are commonly explored in this context is
Tivo's need to receive payments that cover the cost of the hardware
(Apple has similar issues when it comes to media players), but rarely
does not tell you about all the data Tivo harvests about you and can use
in a variety of ways (even selling it).

> be modified.

This defines proprietary software, from the perspective of another
'layer'. Of course, one can just avoid buying Tivo. Mind you, I do not
defend or criticise Tivo; I present other overlooked aspects of this
issue. I fear that your message explores just one side of this debate,
so it lacks balance.

> What Stallman and crew

Is that really necessary? Without RMS et al, it's unlikely you'll have
the /option/ of Free software (shall you require it).

Yes, but Tivo also /receives/ a service. Tivo's supplier is the
thousands of programmers, most of whom worked for free just so that the
fruit of their labour secures their freedom. Many of us FOSS programmers
have a goal in mind, one which is to escape digital lockdown. You can
read about some digital prophecies or watch how software has /already/
devolved to grant no rights to its respective user while permitting
merely everything to those who produce products. There's no conspiracy
theory here, but anyway, I don't want this to become a 'political' argument.

Again, that's /one/ way of looking at that. This is Tivo's "we're a
victim" stance, but you totally neglect several other sides (there are
several, not just one). The definition of freedom comes into place. If
they wanted to leverage code the way they did, BSD-licensed code is out
there. As it stands, one of the 4 freedoms is being compromised, owing
to a loophole. This is not a violation of GPLv2, but nonetheless,
control is taken away from the programmer and can in turn be used to
harm some users (see discussions about privacy, for instance).

>> Some guy called Stallman seems to think you disagree with the goal of the
> GPL:

He does indeed. I've faced similar resistance in other forums and
usually it turns out that those who resist adoption of GPLv3 are
inherently against its long-standing philosophy of the GNU project. I've
seen a lot of this in discussions which revolve around GPUs. Some people
still look for new ways of profiteering from the retraction of freedom,
capitalising on the fact that ownership rules are altered. Have you seen
the number of companies that come under fire for GPL violations recently?

> Yes, I absolutely disagree with Stallman and virtually everything he
> says nowadays. He's gone from genius to socialist zealot.

I spoke to Stallman in the past (I even published an interview with him
last week) and charactering him as a "socialist zealot" (emphasis on thw
word zealot, which has a negative connotation) is something I take
offense in. By this definition, human/animal rights activists might be
zealots as well. How dare we say "no" to the (Pat)riot Act? How dare we
say "no" to DRM, which virtually forbids backup and leaves us having to
buy the same stuff over and over again?

Tivo contains GPL-licensed code. Tivo contains unique components. With
its firmware, availability of the code might be worse than useless. It
also gives a lesson for other companies to follow -- primarily companies
that sought new way to develop things quickly without divulging trade
secrets. In the case of Tivo, replace "trade secrets" with total control.

How would you feel if a company began selling WordPress appliances that
use unique hardware (e.g. special type of clusters) and are being
developed by a group of 500 full-time developers (>Automattic+developer
community)? How would you feel if you were left behind because of those
that took your code and 'enhanced' it are using uber-hardware with all
kinds of disablement technologies? This is all far-fetched and
hypothetic, but Oracle comes to mind (Linux and MySQL forks possible).

It would be trivial to change the business plan. It's akin the a
transformation from a proprietary software business model to one which
is similar to Red Hat's. Companies never like letting revenue drop. It's
business nature, especially when investors are involved. Ask Sun
Microsystems about it. Talk to Simon Phipps and see why selling servers
and balancing that with services and software acquisition costs isn't
what it used to be.

That's correct.

Only if by "free" you go by the definition of the BSDs, namely "I do
what the f* I want". GPLv3 does a better job than GPLv2 when it comes to
"free". It protects the freedoms. It prevents mistrust and possible abuse.

like something different."

Developers are users too and many of them operate based on the
assumption that their code ensures a liberal use of tomorrow's PCs.
There are not many open systems, but anything we do in collaboration can
ensure that we, as users -- along with our friends and families -- can
enjoy products that evolve quickly and respect us more than they respect
just revenue. There are many lessons to be learned from history about that.

It depends on your goals as a developer. You need to define them in
order for this to be seen in the appropriate light.

Hybrid systems are an interesting dilemma. Where would we be today if it
were/were not for compromises? Where would WordPress be if it were not
for b2? Would it be built upon a _truly_ open stack? Will you be able to
get WordPress running for $0+hosting bill? There's an attempt to
encourage people not to be tempted to take shortcuts.

Developers can sell/deliver products to users who like them. If the
software does not respect its prospective user, the user is less likely
to find appeal in it. It's a reciprocal and symbiotic relationship. If
you, as a developer, take extra steps to bring benefits to user, users
will come running to you. The Linux kernel did not mature thanks to a
single man. Its users became its developers too. The same applies to
many WordPress hackers and even people who offer free support.

See the previous two paragraphs. Additionally, things will change as
time goes by. WordPress has a big target painted on its a**e because it
has been exceptionally successful. Other than patents, consider a case
where Drupal and its new 'parent company' choose GPLv3 as a
distinguishing factor (MT has already taken a first step). Did you know
that Linus Torvalds would consider GPLv3 for his kernel if OpenSolaris
went that way? That's the way it works.

You could speak about 'spirit' in the context of Novell, which has done
a _lot_ of damage by betraying it. The spirit -- although the term
sounds kind of abstract and 'hippie' --- is very important. It's about
he trust that keeps developers going.

No. GPLv3 assumes that programmers work for MBAs. Many decisions that
are made which are not necessarily harmonised with the assumptions that
we have, trust included. How many FLOSS programs do you know that also
act as spyware? RealPlayer? Well, it's not FLOSS, it's controlled by a
major company (with investors), and it's also considered the mother of
spyware.

The GPLv3 gives ammunition to a programmer whose understanding of the
problem doesn't align with that of a pointy-haired boss. Programmers can
give CEOs like Ron Hovsepian a warning in advance. Jeremy Allison (of
Samba), for example, needn't explain about that 'spirit' (*Hovsepian
chuckles*) of the GPL, but simply talk about /legal/ implications.

The mindshare advantage make a good start. There are other defenses
whose effect is yet to be fully misunderstood. Remember what I said.

If I may chime in, here, I have to second Matt's request.  As interesting as I find this whole discussion, it would be far more illuminating with practical examples of the do's and don't's associated with each version of the GPL license.  The thread is otherwise getting a bit vague and conceptual, lacking specificity.

OK, popcorn's done popping. . .  Ready?  Set?  Proceed!

Hi guys and Merry Christmas,

I'm using an action hook 'init', that will try to get the post ID 
based on the specific URL that's being visited by the user.

When no url rewriting is used, I can grab the post id using 
$_GET['p'].

However, when URL , rewriting is in use, and I use the post_name 
slug line inside the link, I can't grab the post id at all. I 
tried to play with the WP_rewrite class, and nothing. I also did 
a print_r($_GET) and no slug shows up (thinking I'll do a MySQL 
select to extract my id).

I can't figure out a solution right now, and I'm looking forward
to some opinions.

The reason I'm not using the_ID() method or the global loopable 
$id variable, it's because I'm using the 'init' action hook, 
which doesn't work when no output or wp processing script has 
been called yet, so the only way to extract a single post/page 
id, is to grab the query.

I'm loooking forward to any small/big tip :)

Thanks,

Use url_to_postid function.

I cannot create a black box using WordPress as its foundation and then
sell that black box to customers. Imagine a WordPress appliance.

GPLv3 software cannot be put onto a non-modifiable appliance.

I would be absolutely thrilled. I think that it would be fantastic,
and I would encourage them every step of the way.

You seem to have the opinion that people selling things is bad. It's
not. People selling things is good. That's what creates the economy.
That's what lets you and me continue to eat.

What kinds of "disablement technologies"? That makes no sense at all.
If you mean that you wouldn't be able to load your own software onto
the box, then I would understand it completely and even expect it.
This "appliance" is not a general purpose computer. It's an
"appliance". Do you want to be able to load new programming into your
refrigerator, or into your oven? The very notion of "appliance"
implies a lack of general purpose control.

> Translation: "I don't like Richard Stallman's definition of freedom. I

Yes, that's absolutely correct.

Here's the short of it: I don't release my software under GPLv3
because I WANT people to use my software to create new and innovative
things. That was the whole point. The software should be free. And it
is, under the GPLv2. It's less free under the GPLv3, because less
people are free to use it. How you can claim it to be more free when
it's impossible to use it in a wider variety of circumstances is
beyond me. And Stallman's interpretation of "free" contradicts all
other reasonable interpretations of it, so don't give me that crap.

Can't you also just call get_query_var('p')?

If your refrigerator maker capitalised on the work of volunteer
programmers, then it would be sensible (sometimes even required) that
the maker:

	1. Releases its modification to the code (it can separate its own
software from other layers or modules).

	2. Enables modified code to run or -- more precisely -- does not
actively forbid it from running, a la Tivo.

Thank you. So you just dislike the GPL, or its general philosophy. I no

I apologise if I sounded rude. It's the nature of non-verbal
communication. The interpretation of "free" has never changed. "Free"
sustains itself despite attempts to defeat it in new 'innovative' ways
("innovative" as in "DRM is innovative").

Maybe is a little too early to talk about that? What's wrong with  
GPL2? At least, we can read it without a lawyer, unlike GPL3. I'm not  
pleased to release something under a license that needs a FAQ: the  
license can have legal value, but what about the FAQ?

Another interesting point - at least for me - is about community.
Why WordPress is stuck with php4 and mysql4 "because they're widely  
supported and really tested" but needs to switch its license quite  
early even before a single valid legal test for the GPL3? I think that  
the approach needs to be one and global. If GPL3 is ok, why PHP5  
support is not?

I really can't understand why we have a conservative approach on  
system requirements, but we can afford a enthusiasm-driven licence  
switch. GPL2 is well known and widely accepted, while GPL3 is  
basically just released and not-so-well accepted.

Hi Pixline,

> Maybe is a little too early to talk about that? What's wrong with GPL2?

Nothing is wrong with the GPLv2.

While much of the coversation has drifted towards Tivoization, which is
the more controversial part of the licence, I worry more about other
aspects, such as software patents. There are companies with very broad
patent portfolios and even prior art would cost a fortune to get hold of
and show in a court a law. To give you an example, a company called
Blackboard 'owns' the genius that is having different roles in a CMS,
which facilitates different access privileges. As patent trolling
constantly reaches an all-time high (the popularity of WordPress
likewise), it is worth thinking ahead. Additionally, let me get to
another issue that I will discuss below now that you mentioned MySQL.

> At least, we can read it without a lawyer, unlike GPL3. I'm not pleased

I cannot see what difference the version makes. As you may be aware,
there is already a prominent page in the WordPress Codex about the GPL.
The differences between versions 2 and 3 of the licence are highlighted
in the Groklaw article which I cited earlier. The need for excessive
consultation is part of the smear campaign which plagued the mainstream
press.

> Another interesting point - at least for me - is about community.
> Why WordPress is stuck with php4 and mysql4

That is an excellent, albeit an entirely separate question. It was
discussed here many times in the past and back/forward compatibility in
PHP  proves to be a bit of an issue.

Another thing to point out here is to do with MySQL and the GPL. In an
interview with Matt Aslett (CBR) last year, MySQL's CEO seems to have
described complacene with GPLv2 as temporary. That's why compatibility
issues begin to crop up. According to Palamida (research, consulting),
GPLv3 adoption continues to rise at a steady pace, with over 1,300
projects listed in their database at the moment as ones that are bound
to upgrade (to v3).

> "because they're widely

> even before a single valid legal test for the GPL3?

GPLv3 needn't a case that is very separate from GPLv2. The GPL has
already been tested successfully in some courts. In the US, nobody
wanted to accept the challenge, so there have been several settlements
recently, all of which took place outside the court.

The Wallace case proved about a year ago that his complaints about the
GPL were futile. He lost his appeal too, so things in general look very
encouraging for the licence at the moment. I'll give you the references
if you require them. You can inquire further to be entirely convinced.

> I think that the

That comparison is not a very compelling one. You are comparing licences
(law) to code (mathematics).

I beg to differ because adoption has exceeded expectations. Again, I
will happily back this assertion. There is a lot of disinformation out
'in the wild'.

With kind regards,

Roy

I remember more threads about licences than about "PHP4 vs PHP5" (and I 
don't remember any of these being somewhat productive)

Can't we have a new "wp-omglicencez" mailing list for 2008 ? :-)

I'd be interested in the opposite of this question.  Currently the  
license status quo seems to be fine, so what benefits would there be  
for WordPress to make the change to GPLv3?

It falls back on that old pro versus con list.

Continually talking about some kind of "smear campaign" just makes the
GPLv3 advocates look even more foolish. I am quite capable of thinking
for myself, and I do not like the GPLv3 because I actually read the
damn thing and disagree with what it says. So please refrain from
being insulting, thank you very much.

Compatibility is indeed, very important. This is where the version
does indeed make a difference, because the GPLv2 is incompatible with
the GPLv3. Switching to the GPLv3 will suddenly invalidate a lot of
plugins licensed under GPLv2.

Furthermore, having WordPress under the GPLv3 would make it impossible
for me to ever write a plugin ever again, since there are no
circumstances under which I will ever release any GPLv3 code.

To be quite blunt about it, if WordPress went GPLv3, I'd either fork
it or I'd switch to somebody's else's forked version of WordPress that
remained under the GPLv2. Why? Because I like the code I use to be
free-as-in-speech, not free-as-in-socialism.

About GPL3, my personal alert is user's *real* freedom.
As the linux kernel developers said [1]:

"While we find the use of DRM by media companies in their attempts to  
reach into user owned devices to control content deeply disturbing,  
our belief in the essential freedoms of section 3 forbids us from ever  
accepting any licence which contains end use restrictions."

I think that there's many aspect of that licence that WILL create some  
trouble to the WordPress community, from keeping probably-distinct  
licence information for every external library involved in the  
codebase, to a notable loss of code and contributions, and worst of  
all, this will happens because WordPress has a conservative approach  
on some things, but acts the opposite about its licence. Quite nasty.

I feel like GPL3 is a long and unreadable way to say "we used to trust  
you people, but since some of you aren't nice, we let you have almost- 
all-your-freedom". I think that's not nice - to many of us in this  
list - hear this from WordPress.

This is a matter of attitude, in the WordPress scenario: compatibily  
vs. lobbying.
And for the same reason Matt and the core team choose to not support  
"go php5" campaign, I think that WordPress needs to remain GPL2.

And please trust me, I'm not used to mix math with code: the *reason*  
for both were the same, the *matter* - obviously - not. :-)

Message-ID: <9C25622C-48CC-4747-BAB3-48846B663400@tekartist.org>

Hey all,

I'd like your opinion on if I'm going at a problem from the right  
angle, or missing something.

I'd like to use the full on editor in a plugin I'm planning, as in the  
post and page views (content textarea, w/ tinyMCE if set for user).

I've found the the_editor() function in wp-admin/edit-form- 
advanced.php and can load the tinyMCE JS libs using the script loader  
functions.

Is there a more direct way? A relatively backward compatible one?
Am I in core territory as far as using the_editor(), or is it fair  
game for plugin dev?

Thanks,

I think this is a good idea! I'm writing a Archlinux Handbook (italian  
version) using DocBook. But, but,  there are some problems: IMHO  
project you launch needs:
1) xsl files to produce many formats (pdf, html/xhtml, plaintext, rtf,  
etc...) and this point is more difficult (even if solution to this  
problem we could do it then);
2) a subset of docbook markup (infact, one thing I've noticed about  
docbook syntax is that there are many elements with same sense) so the  
author will probably use coherent syntax;
3) a great coordination rules (for authors).

I say: it's a great idea, so do you agree?

Yeah, I started an User Guide Outline using the XSL DocBook. There are 
plenty of formats supported by PDF, I don't think is one of them. There 
are other ways to convert documents to PDF and RTF. My primary interest 
is only HTMl/XHTML and being able to see my work live. The problem I had 
with the docbook markup before was not being able to visualize what I 
was typing would look like. With XSL, I can do that.

I didn't use the build options in the DocBook XSL book. I used PHP 
5.1.4+ XSLTProcessor() class. Everything seems to work, but I haven't 
done any customizations at this point. The script in PHP is really 
simple. DocBook 5, simplifies a lot of the markup.

I plan on continuing the work on the End User Guide, supported in large 
part by the codex. There shouldn't be large chunks missing after using 
the codex. The second DocBook that I plan to write will be for 
Developers Guide, but that will take longer and I'm not sure I'll have 
it ready before 2.4 is released. There is a lot of information in the 
codex, but information on hooks, filters, and usage documentation for 
how to use the Cron API, Taxonomy API, etc isn't very detailed. I'll 
probably place the effort back into the codex, while I'm working on the 
Developer Guide.

The other issue I have after I complete the User Guide is providing a 
way for others to modify it. I could build something that would allow 
anyone to edit the files, but I'll probably use Google Code instead. 
Anything that uses the Codex has to be GPL, therefore would have to have 
source available.

Documentation is a volunteer effort. I wouldn't hold your breath and 
usually what you are probably doing is getting the foundation for 
someone who is interested to jump on to the project later. DocBook isn't 
so easy as the Codex that anyone can join, or so it would seem.

Ok, dear Jacob. I'm writing articles (about internet, about  
programming, about web design, ...) for Programmazione.it, and I had  
an idea two weeks ago: writing a Wordpress Manual for Developers (in  
Italian, in particular) but ... your project is public? Can I view  
your drafts? Can I contribute or rectify? Or, simply, tranlate your  
drafts in Italian? I think: "why recreate a wheel?".

The story behind the statement from the kernel hackers is interesting.
I'll gladly elaborate if you wish. The gist of it is that Linus went by
gut feeling and other hackers just went along and exclaimed "what he
said" _WITHOUT EVEN READING THE LICENCE. :-)

Alan Cox, by the way, expressed satisfaction about the new licence on
numerous occasions. I'll get you citations if you need them. When later
drafts of GPLv3 came, Linus himself softened his stance too. He still
likes Tivoization though, but it's one among several aspects that are
being addressed in the new licence.

Published just moments ago:

"Right now, we are using the GPL version 3, which is one of the best
licenses out there," said SugarCRM CEO John Roberts.

Source: http://www.linuxinsider.com/rsstory/60949.html

Many developers will actually find attraction in WordPress because of
the new licence. A company as large as SugarCRM uses that as a marketing
tool, not just a way of raving about freedom. It fosters greater
collaboration among more developers, which leads to e.g. more plugins.

What apart from Tivoization says this? And why is this discussion so
focused on this one aspect? I am genuinely curious and I would love to
know why Tivoization has become so synonymous with the effects of GPLv3.

I apologise if that sounded offensive. This wasn't intended.

With kind regards,

Hi,

I am not a GPLv3 advocate, but a programmer who favours Free software.
The GPLv3 protects me from circumvention of the agreement upon which
development is based. It is nothing  more than an /evolutionary/ change
that closes loophole. Nothing has changed. Same rules, more explicit
language.

About the smear campaign, would you like me to give you a detailed list
of incidents where lobbying arms and secretly-hired people speak in the
press? I have plenty of that material at hand, but it just needs
organising. I am willing to do the work if this will end a
chracterisation which -- to use your own words -- makes me "foolish".

I was by no means trying to offend you, but strong language (not
directed at myself) seems to have changed the tone a bit. I realise that
textual correspondence has its deficiencies and negative social effects.

This is not correct. It's a generalisation. See
http://blogs.zdnet.com/Burnette/?p=331

Your disagreement with the philosophy of the GNU GPL was recognised earlier.

> it or I'd switch to somebody's else's forked version of WordPress that

According to this, the 4 freedoms represent free speech, whereas the
addition of a phrase that /explicitly/ forbids Tivoization (something
that was always intended, but not included in the text) turns this into
socialism. I fail to understand how openness of devices can be equated
to socialism, and in a negative way.

I sense a lot of hostility here and it is directed very specifically at
the creation of appliances. I can vividly recall a thread which Matt
Mullenweg started about 3 years ago. It was about one of us wp-hackers
starting a /closed/ project that is a WordPress derivative +
GPL-licensed plugins. Yes, it was frowned upon.

WordPress has always walked the extra mile to ensure that openness of WP
is maintained (unlike, for example, Mambo Server/Joomla/whatever the
latest fragmentation made it be called). Remember the storm which was
started because of issues related to the licensing of plugins?

WP was born and thrived because of the openness of b2 and I'm happy to
know that they keep it that way, _even after_ the creation of the
spinoff/umbrella that is Automattic. I would be disappointed to see
embrace of a philosophy that excludes or separates. Such is the nature
of some things the GPLv3 strives to prevent. This includes division
though patent settlements.

I can't help foreseeing a day when large users like ZDNet or C|Net
become a victim of some patent troll. Without proper thought, this can
lead to fear amongst the suits in the corporate world. We needn't wait
for another SCO to be born.

Best wishes,

Roy

I may be missing something here.  Are you saying converting WP to GPL3 
will somehow protect WP from patent trolling?  That's all I can infer 
from the above, and if so, that's (patently) not true.  ;)

If you develop software, free or otherwise, and someone has a patent on 
process/tech, they can still come after you.   How you license your code 
doesn't 'protect' you from infringing on others.  Now, if some other 
company releases software that is GPL3, and contains patented or 
patentable processes/tech, I would assume from the back and forth on the 
topic that GPL3 basically 'gives away' the patent rights to any user of 
the code.

All this with the caveat: I haven't read the GPL3 as yet, don't plan to 
any time soon. ;) ;)

There are no loopholes in the GPLv2. It does exactly what it claims to
do, nothing more or less, and it cannot be and has not ever been
circumvented.

The GPLv3 adds new things (anti-tivoization clause, anti-DRM clause,
additional restrictions allowed clause) that are both unnecessary and
undesirable, not to mention LESS FREE.

You misunderstand. What is foolish is that you seem to think that all
anti-GPLv3 people are somehow affected by this "smear campaign" that
you continually go on about, as if we've been misled or something.
We're not. We're intelligent, thinking human beings capable of arguing
our own positions and making up our own minds. Whether there was any
such campaign or not is wholly irrelevant.

No, what you were trying to do is obvious. You were trying to dismiss
my opinion by arguing that I had been misled in some way. I find that
highly offensive.

Might I suggest arguing the facts instead of the personalities in the future?

No, it is absolutely correct. WordPress plugins are not aggregates,
they are extensions of the original work (which is WordPress). Ask the
FSF, they'll absolutely agree that if WordPress is GPLv3 then the
plugins cannot be GPLv2.

The GPLv3 is less open because it prevents Tivoization. The GPLv3 is
less open because it prevents use of a technological measure to
control the work (aka DRM). The GPLv3 adds restrictions to the usage
of a work instead of just to the distribution of the work.

As for whether this was "always intended", that's missing the point
entirely. I never intended any such thing, which is why I support the
GPLv2. It does exactly what I want it to do, nothing more or less. The
GPLv3 adds things that I did not intend and do not agree with.

Really, what's so hard to understand about this? Why do you seem to
think that I'm somehow misinformed? I read the two licenses. I
understand the two licenses. I like what the GPLv2 says, I don't like
what the GPLv3 says. Is this somehow unacceptable to you? They are
different licenses which do different things. Intentions be damned,
I'm looking at the TEXTS here.

I have not read any such thing, however if a WordPress based appliance
were to be created and sold, the GPLv2 would ensure that any source
changes would have to be released. What more do you want? The GPLv3
would force the makers of such an appliance to, basically, make it
*not an appliance*. That's going too far, in my opinion.

The GPLv2 can do that quite well without adding the useless and
less-open clauses of the GPLv3.

So would I, that would be why I would absolutely not use a GPLv3
version of WordPress. The GPLv3 is divisive and exclusive. It does not
allow compatibility. It does not allow usage. Like I said, I would
switch to a forked version of WP using the original license (or fork
it myself) immediately. Then I could continue to use open code,
instead of closed code.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Fix for importing Markdown posts from Movable Type
Message-ID: <BF3F5BE6-EDAE-461A-9CAE-9406F22687AE@gmail.com>

Recently I tried to import a few hundred posts from Movable Type 3.2  
to WordPress 2.3.1. The posts were written in Markdown format, for  
which leading and trailing spaces on a line can be significant. The  
import mishandled the posts that had lines with leading or trailing  
spaces because of line 281 in wp-admin/import/mt.php:

     $line = trim($line);

Changing this line to

     $line = rtrim($line, "\n");

fixed the problem because it got rid of the trailing newline without  
affecting the other whitespace. I have no idea whether this change  
would break imports from other formats, but it worked for my situation.

I first posted a description of my problem on [this thread][1] of the  
Markdown mailing list. Sam Angove found the offending line.

I tend to be of the opinion that "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".

Otto, Roy, whomever:

Can anyone give us a _specific_, _concrete_, and _compelling_ reason  
why remaining with GPL2 is BAD, or why moving to GPL3 is GOOD.   
_Specifically_, as relates to WordPress: How is WordPress _harmed_ by  
remaining with v2, or how is it _improved_ by moving to v3.

Beyond those questions, this is really all academic and mostly off- 
topic.

doesn't degenerate into "who's being offensive"; but let's bring it

No, I started on the End User Guide, since it is easier and can be 
finished before version 2.4 is released. The full extent is essentially 
what amounts to an outline. If you are writing an Developers Guide, then 
I think our goals can be combined to complete both versions. If you 
continue to write your WordPress Manual for Developers in whatever 
language, then someone will most likely translate it into English later 
(depending on what license you use).

If you wish to translate the completed English WordPress Manual for 
Users to Italian, or what would amount to translating choice sections of 
the codex to Italian, then I think it would serve both of our purposes. 
After I complete the WordPress User Guide, I can contribute to your 
project with sections for Plugins, hooks, and a tiny portion on 
Taxonomy. What I know about the Cron and Taxonomy API is very little and 
most of it came from those who experienced it already. However, if you 
have some information it might give more motivation to others who do 
know more about those two complex topics to contribute more towards 
their completion.

My main course of study when working with WordPress has been the Plugin 
API, so I have a lot of focus geared towards that. There are already 
more than a few articles on the codex detailing the Plugin API, but not 
quite enough fine details to place in a Developers Manual. There are 
projects that list many of the WordPress action and filter hooks, 
however I'm not sure those projects are current and I'm unsure what 
license that site has listed the hooks under. It would be better I think 
to write the hooks from the perspective of an manual and not from the 
specification viewpoint. That is, if you choose to write the hooks in, 
there are probably more than 100 hooks, just from WordPress versions <2.2.

I think perhaps also, I'm going to join the wp-docs mailing list and 
write to that mailing list what I have finished over the weekend and 
where the repository will be, and how people can contribute.

I do have a question. Are you planning on writing the Developer's Manual 
in English and Italian or just English or just Italian? If you are 
writing it in Italian then I could run it through babelfish and edit the 
contents to make sense, but it would be much better if someone who knows 
Italian and English translated it either way. I suppose my issue, is 
that I barely know English so attempting to edit something through 
babelfish probably wouldn't turn out as well as I wanted.

I'm happy someone else has the same goals as me. So good luck with your 
project and hopefully you see it to completion. If you have it in 
English, then I'll look you up on the wp-doc mailing list after I finish 
the End User Guide, which won't be done this weekend or probably next 
week either. I also might get bored and start back writing low level 
source documentation. Oh yeah, I had an epiphany while looking at the 
Taxonomy scheme and it appears that some of the source documentation 
could use some clarity.

This is an important issue for a lot of projects but I'm unable to
imagine this being an issue for WordPress. Do you have a use case in
mind here? Black-box personal web servers sold at a loss?

---- OT below this line ----

Yes, you can.

I did a little research on tivoization. Tivo can release their
products under GPLv3 and still protect their bottom line through
technical measures. The GPLv3 says:

"Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself
materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or
violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network."

So, under the GPLv3, the User Product may not refuse to run modified
code but if it relies upon a network and the software modifications
hurt the network (e.g. circumvent a payment system that is necessary
to the network's continued operation) the network may refuse access.
You can still do whatever you want with your Tivo hardware and they
can still build payments into their network service requirements. They
may not "brick" your device, but they may refuse access to /their
network/ for violation of any arbitrary rule, including unsigned
software. The only remaining problem is that they will not be able to
profit off people buying only the device and not the service. I expect
to see the GPLv3 Tivo priced much higher so as to profit on those who
do not buy service, with substantial discounts for long-term service
contracts just like cell phone service carriers.

The razor blade model works when the razor handle is truly useless
except for holding blades. As soon as your customer finds another
valuable use for the handle, your blade sales suffer and your revenue
model falls apart. That risk is much greater with a computer because
computers are more generally useful as a result of their intrinsic
qualities.

GPLv3's User Product clause protects the rights of users to tinker
with their possessions. Simply put, it says you may not limit the
usefulness of a device. I believe that a device vendor that disables
modified devices is doing wrong and as a free software developer I
don't want my work to be used by any such vendor.

Sweet, a real use case! Sorry if I missed something obvious, but how
does this stack up for or against GLPv3? Does this guy want to convey
the software in a way that would make it impossible to use a modified
WordPress?

Message-ID: <5cdeb9b20712290253j236ad17eh90c294004afc518e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'm back in the WordPress plugin hacking world, with a few questions.

1. Print CSS

I noticed that WP does not provide a print stylesheet out of the box
(I thought it used to, but I may remember incorrectly -- depends on
the theme, I guess). Anyway, I started looking around for existing
plugins to add a print stylesheet before writing my own. I found WP
Print <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-print/> but it adds a
print link and seems a bit heavy. All I want is basically to insert
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/blah/print.css"
media="print" title="Normal" /> in the header and provide a CSS file.
So, sub-questions:

- is there a plugin I missed that does roughly what I want?
- does anybody know of pre-existing print stylesheets for the Sandbox theme?
- I see a few filters containing the word "stylesheet" here
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference#Template_Filters>
but honestly, what they do seems a bit fuzzy according to the
description (I'm not very knowledgable in how WP deals with
stylesheets); what would the best way be to insert my line of HTML in
the header -- assuming that editing the template manually is not an
option?

2. Is feed or not?

As described in this post
<http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2007/12/04/ridding-wordpress-plugins-of-template-tags/>,
I've modified the Similar Posts plugin to automatically add the
similar posts links. I want them at the beginning of the content in
the blog, but at the end of the post content in the feed. So, I wrote
two different functions for that and then used this code for the
hooks:

if(is_feed()) {
	add_action('the_content', 'sp_embed_feed_similar_posts');
}else{
	add_action('the_content', 'sp_embed_similar_posts');
	}

Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work. In the feed, the similar
posts are placed like in the main blog page, which means the second
function was used. What am I missing here?

3. Sandbox drop-down menu problem in IE/win

This isn't exactly a plugin problem. The drop-down menus in the
sandbox theme down behave correctly in IE/win -- they drop /next/ to
the parent menu, instead of /under/ it, making access to the next item
on the menu bar impossible.

- has anybody already solved this problem?
- is this the right place to try to find help for this?

4. Using ob_start()

I've been told this could be a bit nasty, but it seems a solution for
my Basic Bilingual plugin (updated last night in the plugin
repository, btw!), which I would like to make capable of inserting
lang="xx" attributes in various pre-existing elements in templates.

Can somebody tell me if I'm on the right track with the following:

function bb_replace($buffer) {
	$search = blah blah
        $replace = blah blih bloh
	return preg_replace($search, $replace, $buffer);
}

function bb_buffer() {
		ob_start('bb_replace');
}

add_action('template_redirect', 'bb_buffer'); // is this the correct
hook to use?

I guess I could also use this method to add my stylesheet link
(problem #1 above) but I guess there is a more elegant solution for
it.

Thanks a lot for your help -- feels nice to be "coding" again!

Hooking into wp_head and outputting the html then is what you want to
do I believe.  This is how WordPress itself adds things to the theme
link the rsd link, generator (in 2.4), wlw manifest file etc.

I suspect this is due to the fact that when you are calling add_action
the query has not yet run and so WordPress doesn't know if it is a
feed on not.
Move the check on is_feed into the function that is called when
the_content action occurs and all should be well.

hope these answers help

I totally missed the one. additionally, the point just raised by Alex
King ought to be considered.

Tivization is really a secondary issue here, but it seems to be the only
one which receives attention.

There are several hypothetical scenarios which come to mind:

	1. Patent intimidation and settlements can be used to divide
	and separate 'licensed' WP from 'unlicensed' WP.

	2. Closing of the code -- however partial it might be -- can be
	achieved through loopholes. Some examples have been mentioned in
	this thread.

	3. Developer affinity. I am aware of various developers to whom
	GPLv3 has a special appeal. It represent a step forward rather than
	complacence. Drupal can use this as a competitive advantage that
	attracts programmers and software-savvy bloggers. MT is one to
	watch out for as well.

	4. Compatibility (long-term sight). I don't know where pertinent
	packages like TinyMCE are headed, but it's worth finding out.

This is the second message you've mentioned patent issues, and I haven't 
seen a response to my initial query.  You seem to be indicating that 
GPL3 will somehow help with patent issues.  Unless you mean protecting 
us (devs/users) from someone like Automattic patenting things, if you 
are talking about a third-party coming after WP and big WP users/devs 
for potential infringement of CMS patents, how the code is licensed 
won't make a difference.  So... if you could explain in more detail what 
you're thinking/assuming GPL3 helps with patent issues, I'd be 
interested to hear it.. ;)

I figure that if someone is capable of editing a css file, they're  
also capable of adding a line in the theme header. So why bother with  
the extra overhead of a plugin? Besides, it really is a theme specific  
issue because you are typically turning off the printing of particular  
items, and that depends on how they are constructed and named in the  
theme.

I usually just add this line to my theme header file:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo  
get_bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?>/print.css" type="text/css"  
media="print" />

Make it the last stylesheet link line so it's rules will override the  
others that come before it. Then put a print.css file in the same  
directory as the rest of the theme files and edit it as desired.

If you Google for "print style sheet" you should be able to find some  
good articles with suggestions for the kinds of things you might want  
to include in your own. For example, I like to include a rule to print  
out URLs in parenthesis after links since you can't actually click  
them on paper:

a:link:after, a:visited:after { content: " (" attr(href) ") "; }

quite true. however:

I'm trying to move all my mods out of the theme. Too annoying when
there are theme updates and you have a dozen or so small changes to
make again and again -- bound to forget one.

Also, my idea is to provide a css print file which works with Sandbox
well. People with no CSS skills, but who want their sandbox-based blog
to look OK in print could use it. If I need to create the css file
myself, I can do it without any trouble, but I'd rather not reinvent
the wheel.

I think I'm more or less sorted out regarding this problem. wp-head to
insert the link, and I've got a few ressources to do the css.

thanks (if somebody DOES have a print.css working with sandbox,
though, it's not too late to send it my way -- probably won't be
working on this before Monday).

Imagine a scenario where a company forks WordPress and then signs a
patent deal (licensing) with a patent troll. Suppose that company acts
selfishly and then uses such pseudo-protection to pull people away from
WP. From the GPLv3 preamble:

"Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
wish to avoid the special  danger that redistributors of a free program
will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL makes it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all."

There are more scenarios to be considered, such as licensing with
clients/users rather than vendor/distributor.

I apologise if I didn't reply to your initial query. I must have missed it.

After a few hit-and-miss attempts, I'm a little more advanced, and the
problem has morphed into a regex issue. Here's what I have:

function bll_insert_slug_links($buffer) {

       $search = '</div><!-- #access -->';
       $replace = bll_make_slug_links() . $search;
      // return preg_replace($search, $replace, $buffer);
      return str_replace($search, $replace, $buffer);
      }

function bll_embed_slug_links_well($buffer) {
		ob_start('bll_insert_slug_links');
}

add_action('template_redirect', 'bll_embed_slug_links_well');

I've tested it and it works, inserting the code generated by
bll_make_slug_links() right before the closing </div> I wanted. So, to
answer my own question, I was indeed on the right track.

It gets more complicated, however, when the code I try to match is
'</ul></div> .....some whitespace..... </div><!-- #access -->'. As the
nature of the whitespace is undetermined, that means I have to use
ereg_replace() or preg_replace() (I don't think it's possible with
str_replace(), correct me if I'm wrong). And this is where all goes to
hell because I've forgotten how to format regexes properly.

Here's my first (failing) attempt:

$search='/<\/ul><\/div>\s\s+<\/div><\!-- \#access -->/';

Assistance from a regex wizard would be muchly appreciated. Also, am I
going to have to escape the string returned by bll_make_slug_links()?
(it's a bunch of HTML links).

Thanks for your help,

Steph

First, the scenario is a bit bogus... If a patent holder decided WP is 
in their sights, all WP forks would be 'hit up'.  Signing a license to 
protect them from potential legal action regarding said patent certainly 
wouldn't give them any more reason to 'pull away from WP' -- no more 
than ANY fork would.  If anything, one company 'giving in' would 
increase the likelihood that all WP offshoots would be 'attacked'.

Second, the preamble is in GPLv2.  V3 adds much more detailed language 
regarding patents (many, many paragraphs), but V2 does have patent 
clauses in there.  My belief is it is trying to make patent 'situations' 
much more explicit (legalese is all about whether you WANT gray areas, 
or WANT explicit terms... ;) but IANAL).  But I don't imho think V2 in 
any way protects someone in the scenario you gave -- the code is still 
GPL code, must still be distributed as a derivative work of the original 
WP (which is a derivative itself...).  The other thing V3 seems to add 
is much clearer language on patent/license being granted from all 
contributors -- which is a standard for any multi-company working groups 
today already.

Third, a reality of patent trolling is that they are going to go after 
big fish, not small ones.  Big corporations, etc.  And in that case, it 
could be more 'use' of the software than 'distribution' of it (imagine 
WP.COM or other WPMU hosting providers being hit), in a sense.

So, yes, V3 tries to make patent language much more explicit.  But V2 
also has decent supporting language:

For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If you have and distribute GPL code, and sign a license that wouldn't 
permit normal redist rights of the GPL code (completely unlimited, 
derivative works rights, etc.), then you are in violation of the GPL and 
can no longer 'distribute' it at all.  So, even under V2, signing a 
patent license is more of a 'user' protection racket than a 'distributor 
or creator' one.  I haven't read V3 in enough details, and IANAL, but my 
quick read saw more language about third party contributions giving 
patent rights (which is generally implicit in GPL projects).

I'm not sure how GPL covers 'hosting providers' (wp.com, et al) come to 
think of it.  That Chameleon thing is a good example, but WP.com and 
other WPMU sites are just as valid.  They provide services on top of 
(often forked/custom) GPL code, but on their own servers.  They don't 
redistribute the code (to the best of my knowledge), but they make money 
from it.  Some would say that as an application service provider selling 
a GPL-based application, anyone who buys/uses the service should be 
given opportunity to download the modified source.  I don't know.  And 
is there a difference in how they make their money (some make it by ads, 
some directly charge users, some charge via other 'consulting' work).

Anyway, fun excuse to read docs I have no need or time to read. ;) ;)

GPLv2:

"The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from
the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)."

GPLv3:

"To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying."

These are only highlights. I recommend reading the licenses. They are
not as hard to read as most EULAs.

That's both an advantage and a disadvantage. The ability to read ti 
without a lawyer makes it weaker in court. (Not directly: it's just that 
some of the less controversial changes in GPL3 were designed to address 
specific legal concerns and make the language clearer to lawyers and 
judges.)

Here's one specific advantage of GPL3: it is much more compatible with 
non-U.S. legal systems. GPLv2 had some problems in a number of 
jurisdictions that GPLv3 does not. That may be significant even if you 
don't care about issues like DRM and Tivoisation one way or the other.

Providing a print stylesheet is the responsibility of the theme
author. If WordPress' default and classic themes don't have them then
it would be good to add them.

If you're writing a plugin which adds a print stylesheet, just add the
link via the wp_head hook.

Tarski includes a print stylesheet, it's fairly basic but they're
really not a lot of work to write: just some basic element styles and
then hide headers, footers and the like.

Please explain this in more detail. The GPLv2 has no loopholes that I
am aware of. There is no way to close the code.

What about developer dislike as well? I've already stated here,
repeatedly, that I will not use GPLv3 code under any circumstances. I
am not alone in that respect, and to suggest otherwise is
disingenuous.

Any packages that choose to use incompatible licensing schemes like
the GPLv3 should be removed from WordPress. WordPress should not
change its own licensing just to be able to use some specific package.
Instead, alternative packages should be used.

Exactly. Additionally, each theme uses different markup, so it  
doesn't make sense to use the same print stylesheet for all themes  
(which I think Stephane was suggesting).

By closing of the code I was actually referring to:

	1. Binary bridges/shims, a la Novell.

	2.  Exclusive permission to run code, 'thanks' to software patents.

	3. To an extent -- Tivoization. It's not closing of the code (similar
to (2)), but it's a restriction on execution, so openness has its
purpose beaten.

Howdy

Forgive me for intruding with this here, but I think I've exhausted all 
the alternative avenues. The latest version of my plugin committed 
(0.2.2.5) isn't showing up on the plugin home page, (going on 24 hours 
since commit) although I can see it in trunk etc at  
svn.wp-plugins.org/astickypostorderer/trunk/

vs.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/astickypostorderer/
 
Additionally anything I try to post to the forums or even comment under 
my plugins home page gets blocked, perhaps akismet or some such not 
liking the ip I'm on or something? :-/

The previous version of my plugin (0.2.2.3) turned out to have some 
serious bugs (/me cringes) so I am quite desperate to get the latest 
version live - can anyone help? I've tried posting via 
wordpress.org/report-bugs/ but haven't received any kind of even 
automated receipt (is there such a thing?) - so dunno if whatever is 
blocking me from the forums is blocking that as well.

 

Thanx

Heh.  Gives lie to that whole "Howdy" discussion from last week, eh wot?

*grin*

Andre:
I believe there have been multiple reports of such issues occurring.
Last I heard, the Automattic support folk were scratching their heads
a bit.  Manually notifying them is a nice stopgap measure to get your
plugin[s] updated, AFAICT.  Dunno when an actual fix to the problem
will occur.

veryplaintxt is based on Sandbox and it has a print.css
You might be able to start with that.

quite true. however:

I'm trying to move all my mods out of the theme. Too annoying when
there are theme updates and you have a dozen or so small changes to
make again and again -- bound to forget one.

Also, my idea is to provide a css print file which works with Sandbox
well. People with no CSS skills, but who want their sandbox-based blog
to look OK in print could use it. If I need to create the css file
myself, I can do it without any trouble, but I'd rather not reinvent
the wheel.

I think I'm more or less sorted out regarding this problem. wp-head to
insert the link, and I've got a few ressources to do the css.

thanks (if somebody DOES have a print.css working with sandbox,
though, it's not too late to send it my way -- probably won't be
working on this before Monday).

Sorry for unable to getting back on this sooner.
Can confirm that the patch indeed fixes it. When backported, also works
on older version of WP as well.

Are you guys aware that the top level headings (i.e. h2.fancy, only the 
first heading on the page as far as I can see) is being pushed off to 
the left and the background image (i.e. 
http://s.wordpress.org/style/v3-head/wiki%20title.png) isn't being used?

If this is intentional, it's definitely annoying, as I have to look at 
the <title> attribute (i.e. look at the window/tab's title) to find out 
what it is.

Thanks,
Ryan.

Definitely unintentional. Probably broke as a result of upgrading to  
MediaWiki 1.11.

Yeah, it does look unintentional, just need to wait for someone who can do
anything about it to read these messages.
