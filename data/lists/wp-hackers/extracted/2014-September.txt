This is awesome stuff.

Personally I am annoyed by the pollution of page hit (visitor) statistics. 
So the same trigger cq. trap could be used to filter out those. At this 
point I am probably not allowed by my host in any way to start blocking 
IPs at the Apache level (even that) but it is easy enough to implement it 
in PHP at least for my purposes.

I guess it should then just be the first link on every page, which is 
currently a "home" link. It could be something ridiculously funny like 
geteatenalive.php but that might also tempt some human diggers :P.

Alright let's see what it does. I have this table:

CREATE TABLE wordpr_trap_victims (
   id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   ip_address VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
   host_name VARCHAR(255),
   time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   user_agent VARCHAR(255),
   referer VARCHAR(2000),
   INDEX(ip_address)
);

My site has a /norobot/deathtrap.php that takes a base64 encoded parameter 
"r" with the referer field of the page that generated the link to this 
script. Then, if following this link is the first action the spider takes 
after getting to my site, I should get the original referer field pointing 
to the originating crawl script. There is one crawler (semalt.com) that 
constantly indexes my site or whatever it does. I'm not sure what it does 
but it is a search rankings scheme kinda thing. It uses a zillion 
different aliases like 905.semalt.com and 512.semalt.com and so on.

The script just silently adds a row to the table and then redirects to the 
front page.

Within a few days I should know if any crawler actually follows that link.

This will be the motto:

//You may think you are a spider, but to me, you're just a fly. This is my 
web... and *I* am the spider.//

I just have the link hidden with inline CSS but that shouldn't make too 
much of a difference....

Let's see if this will be any fun :D.

Kudos, Bart

Subject: [wp-hackers] is_single() includes attachments
Message-ID: <54051E1F.2070409@xenhideout.nl>

(I wrote this two weeks ago).

Hi all,

There seems to be a bit of a confusion all around about the "is_single()" 
template function.

>From the Codex:

"This conditional tag checks if a single post of any post type except 
attachment and page post types is being displayed. (...). To check for all 
the post types, use the is_singular() function."

However when you check the code it is clear attachments are included, not 
excluded:

(Talking about 3.9.2 now)..

query.php: WP_Query::init_query_flags() initializes $this->is_single to
false.

query.php: WP_Query::parse_query() then does:

if ( ('' != $qv['attachment']) || !empty($qv['attachment_id']) ) {
      $this->is_single = true;
      $this->is_attachment = true;
}

Also, further down:

} elseif ( '' != $qv['static'] || '' != $qv['pagename'] || 
!empty($qv['page_id']) ) {
      $this->is_page = true;
      $this->is_single = false;
}

This "is_single = false" is pointless since is_single was already false in
all conditions. But that's beside the point really. From the code you can
see that "pages" are excluded but "attachments" are included in
"is_single".

There is other code that depends on this:

E.g. post-template.php, get_body_class(), line 536:

if ( is_attachment() ) {

...only runs if is_single() is also true, ie. it is situated inside an if
( is_single() ) block.

But this code in query.php is meaningless now:

$this->is_singular = $this->is_single || $this->is_page ||
$this->is_attachment;

because is_single already includes is_attachment at this point.

It seems to me that the intent of this design was for is_single to NOT
include is_attachment.

In 3.9.2 the offending line is at query.php:1500, in trunk it is at
query.php:1590.

(There is a lot more documentation for that function (parse_query) in
trunk...?)

--------
There is this function in link-template.php:

function adjacent_posts_rel_link_wp_head() {
      if ( !is_singular() || is_attachment() )
          return;
      adjacent_posts_rel_link();
}

That could also be written as:

function adjacent_posts_rel_link_wp_head() {
      if ( is_single() || is_page() ) {
          adjacent_posts_rel_link();
      }
}

provided that is_single would actually work as intended.

(!is_singular || is_attachment) is equivalent to !(is_singular &&
!is_attachment) which means you could also write:

function adjacent_posts_rel_link_wp_head() {
      if ( is_singular() && !is_attachment ) {
          adjacent_posts_rel_link();
      }
}

and that would currently also work.)

---
This code:

function get_boundary_post( $in_same_term = false, $excluded_terms = '',
$start = true, $taxonomy = 'category' ) {
      $post = get_post();
      if ( ! $post || ! is_single() || is_attachment() || ! taxonomy_exists(
$taxonomy ) )
          return null;
}

actually only tests for is_attachment because of the is_single() flaw.

It ought to be covered by !is_single() but that doesn't work, so an
additional test is needed.

Of course there is many more references to is_single() and you'd need to
check them all. Many templates may also have been designed around this
aberrant code. Any template that checks for is_single expecting it to only
cover single posts, would find to (its) surprise that attachments are also
covered by that code. So e.g. some sidebar code that does different things
depending on query/page type would need to test for is_attachment first or
as a form of "if (is_single && !is_attachment)".

I encountered it because I have some buggy sidebar code that bugs out on
any anomaly of this kind. Canary in the coalmine kinda thing :p.

I am not any regular contributor, nor have I ever contributed any code to
anything, but instead of writing this as a bug in TRAC I thought I would
(first) post it here.

I guess I could submit a bug and then start modifying files, make patch
files out of them, then attach them to the bug, but it is still a
modification that can affect a lot of files (potentially) so I guess I
just want to offer this just as a suggestion for now.

Bart Schouten, NL.

Looking for some specific code:

There is, or was, a drop-in database lib tool for WordPress that can 
allow a site to have multiple read/write database servers.
If I recall correctly this was developed years ago in the earlier days 
of WP.org and I believe this was built and made available as open source 
to by Automattic.

Basically what it does is the you configure the site so the any number 
of database servers can be used for ultra high traffic scenarios, and 
each DB server in the config can be set for reads or writes. Then when 
WP needs to do a query it determines which server to send the request 
to. Something like that.

Anyone know where that code is located?

Thanks! That should prove useful some day.

>From what I see it is not a real parallel computing thing in the sense of 
it being really advanced but it seems to rely on partitions of the data 
set in order to simply say "this part gets stored there" and "this other

full redundancy would obviate any advantages; then again, we are talking 
about db-reads mostly so any regular 'load balancing' strategy should be 
sufficient or perfect for this as well... (?) . Actually, it seems pretty 
awesome.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Syndication Input Sought
Message-ID: <D0325923.1051FE%jeff.lambert@jvhm.com>

Looking to see if anyone has ideas on the best approach to this scenario:

I have a client who has a couple of sites that we want to syndicate, partly
through opening up a JSON tunnel and also by serving up a page within an
iframe on the subscriber?s site.

To get here my plan was to bring the content of our two sites together and
syndicate the centrally managed content out to our two sites, as well as to
those who sign up for our service.  This is the path I?ve taken.

In researching this awhile back I came across this offering by VIP
WordPress, http://vip.wordpress.com/plugins/syndication.  Perfect solution,
so, I did some hunting and found there is a plugin, developed by Automattic,
up on the plugin repository, http://wordpress.org/plugins/push-syndication/.
While it hasn?t been updated in awhile there were some answers to somewhat
recent support topics and a reference to a more current version on github,
which I?m running.  Unfortunately, my support posts go unanswered and I now
have run into a new issue and will likely not use this option anymore unless
someone here has some thoughts about it.

So, I?m looking for suggestions on a different approach.  if I pull the two
sites onto my multisite and run them as sub-sites, is there a good way to
parse out the posts from the primary site to these sub-sites?  Anyone done
this?  I?m not worried about search engine hate as I?ll be ?blocking? the
search engines from my main content site and those who sign up for our
service are only displaying content on their Intranets.

Specific info:

Main content management site is:  http://accuranews.com

Current site that I?m trying to push content to:
http://www.frequentbusinesstraveler.com

Future second site to push content to is:  http://www.thedieseldriver.com

Thanks in advance for your help!

Cheers,

Jeff

Hi Jeff,

Have you stumbled upon the ThreeWP Broadcast(
http://plainview.se/wordpress/threewp-broadcast/ ) plugin? There's a free
and paid version(one-time payment, one year of updates and support - and
the support is pretty quick in general).
It's not fully automatic, meaning that you have to select what content
should be "broadcasted" to which sub-sites. You can do this when you're
creating a post, after you've created one, etc. You can also remove the
content from the child sites from the main site. You can update all local
links to point to the correct place(so instead of them pointing to the main
site, they'll point to the sub-site).

It's not a bad plugin and I've used it on a multisite with about 12
sub-sites and it works fairly well(a bit slow on a BlueHost shared hosting,
even though it's the more expensive option).

Nikola

Hi,

I can only say that to me, the first solution you envisioned sounds really 
inspired and creative and solid. But the alternative path you suggest 
after, sounds just like you're running out of time and you need a quicker 
solution.

I do hope you will be able to find something that really satisfies you..

All the best,

Bart.

ps. maybe you should push harder to get support on that plugin. I mean, 
wherever, in here, somewhere else. "unless someone here has some thoughts 
about it" is not a very invitational statement to make if you are looking 
for that kind of help. That's like admitting defeat before you've even 
asked anything...

Anyway, good luck.

Thanks Bart and Nikola.

Nikola - I?ll take a look at threewpbroadcast.

Bart - Probably am feeling defeated as I keep running into roadblocks on
this plugin and really don?t have the bandwidth, and likely the knowledge
to dig into the code.  I did a little looking around but think there are
things on the WP side I?m not aware of, especially given that it requires
JetPack be installed on the receiving site.  If you have thoughts on how
to get support, or engage someone to here to help make this plugin work,
I?m all ears.

Cheers,

Jeff

It may be worth looking into the?WP-API, which is the JSON api slated to go into core in 4.1 (I think). I haven't used it, but I think it will provide JSON endpoints withou requiring the Jetpack plugin, if you're looking to avoid that.

That seems pretty good, like, exactly the same thing as the Facebook 
"Graph" API.

But the only downside that you're making it extremely easy for anyone to 
gain this type of access, if you're not careful. Which is why I would be 
hesitant...

It's funny. The Facebook Graph API provides for less information than the 
regular web interface. And all those developers that want to use it, are 
complaining about that. For instance, you cannot even retrieve your own 
friendslist unless every one of your friends give you (or your app) 
permission to do so. Meanwhile, if you're willing to put in the effort, 
all of that information is easily 'grabbable'.

In any case, I understand your feeling, Jeff. You can get exhausted from 
trying things that don't ever seem to work. Jetpack is also not the most 
...elegant or useful addition to the fleet. Suddenly you are mandated to 
install a 21 meg plugin that comes with a million features and requires a 
WP.com account to basically do anything, and that is actually not a plugin 
itself but a plugin framework within the plugin framework of WP.org. 
Personally, I intend to use it at some point, but I'm going to strip away 
the all-too-obvious "container" aspect to it at least in terms of the user 
interface (the word "Jetpack" is meaningless to me because it doesn't do 
anything useful; "stats" and "akismet" are not). And get rid of all the 
modules I don't use anyway, and will never use. After that it will just be 
a common library to the few 'modules' I do use :) :p.

Just giving it its proper position ;-).

When I read the page at http://wordpress.org/plugins/push-syndication/, I 
feel a lot of sadness. As if those developers that had once written those 
words with inspiration, are now feeling drained, as you do. The plugin was 
probably conceived as something relatively standalone. But today 
everything has come under a heavier wind and this wind is pushing forward 
in some sort of frenzy of WordPress.com integration of everything.

For example, one of the Jetpack advantages is listed as "if you let us do 
your statistics, it will not burden your own servers, but rather ours, 
that are extremely speedy." How one cloud-hosted server park can ever be 
faster than a local server is beyond me, unless you'd be talking about the 
caching advantages of webclients retrieving things like jQuery from 
centrally hosted locations (such as some Google server) instead of your 
site. But it is nonsensical to think that the computing power of millions 
of decentralized hosts would be dwarfed by a few centrally hosted server 
parks. And these guys think they are some kind of awesome. When you check 
the stats page of a newly configured stats counter or API key or whatever, 
you are greeted with the message "Whoa! Not so fast! We just started 
counting, there's nothing here yet, DUDE." Liberally cited, but still, 
that was the gist of the message. Completely inappropriate for something 
that is meant to be a serious, boring (but still exciting) "accounting" 
system. Suddenly we're all being turned into surfer dudes when really, we 
just wanted to check out how that page looked.

Jetpack is really not that cool. Not nearly as cool as they try to make it 
out to be..

So perhaps you're also feeling drained because that plugin you got excited 
about, it is really at a true 'dead end' or at least a 'not feeling it 
anymore' end.

So there's probably something that they're doing (or that someone is 
doing) that is more in line with 'the times' and it is just a matter of 
getting through the grief of having lost this old thing, so you can make 
room for the new thing and I'm sure it will soon fall into your hands, or 
cross paths with you...

It is just a bit of a feeling of depression I guess.. that I'm feeling 
right now..

Kudos,

Bart.

Hey Jeff, I have run into this syndication issue on several occasions and have tested many different variations from publishing all posts to one "mother' site in a WPMS environment and then sharing the posts with child or sub sites to utilizing various 'syndication' routines from plugins to even coding up an RSS routine.  I have settled on using the Autoblog plugin from WPMU.  It works very well and has the options I need.  That I would pass it on.  Hope this helps - https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/autoblog/

My apologies about this 'top-post', it was a bit unclear, but I was

By James DiGioia, Mon, 8 Sept 2014.


In any case, it has me thinking.. There is one bot in the crawlers to my 
site I've been observing that gives me a really bad feeling. It is the 
"meanpathbot". What the "meanpathbot" does is basically just steal all 
your content, all your css, all your javascript, and then sell it to 
researchers and journalists and the like who like to analyse that data to 
their benefit.

Which could, for example, be sensitive content you removed at the perfect 
time from your site so as to gain enough exposure for it, but not too 
much.

It could be anything. And they try to archive it and then provide access 
to all of it, to anyone who is willing to fork out the cash. Which starts 
at $500 USD per month.

I am definitely going to block that one. But on the topic of public "REST" 
APIs, if you allow your content (that is basically something you protect 
and control its access paths to) to be retrieved by THIRD parties (like 
Facebook does) but WITHOUT the representation you have so carefully chosen 
(by designing your web interface) or that (in the case of Facebook) your 
users may have carefully chosen so as to provide a certain feeling and a 
certain integrity of what others see of you, within a certain access 
domain ---

And now suddenly everyone and his green seamonkey can just press a button 
and download it all, irrespective of who they are or where they are at...

I just say that that is something you need to carefully watch against.

Something becomes more valuable if a user/visitor/person has to put in a 
bit of effort, such as taking the time to actually visit your site. Or to 
get to know you. Or to first hear about you. Or to know where to look for 
information. Or to be intrigued by what you offer and to seek more.

If you were to write a book, get it printed, and then give it away for 
free, you will find 95% of it in the dustbins of the area where you have 
been handing it out. People will take it off your hands, look at it for 2 
seconds, get bored, and throw it away. That's just the way it goes..

So make sure you maintain the proper balance between what people are 
getting from you, and what they are putting in themselves. That's just 
what I'm trying to say.

Don't be a whore who trades something worthless for something equally 
worthless. Your content is valuable. It has a price, a worth, a value. It 
has seen effort. It has seen sweat. It has perhaps even seen a lot of 
blood. Or even some tears as well.

So don't start giving it all away just because it could mean more exposure 
of it. Don't be the one who gets rejected. Be the one who rejects.

Even if directly monetizing access is not your business model. Even if you 
are not a business for money at all. There is still something you want, be 
it a form of popularity, of being a popular place where people like to 
hang out, a type of community centre, you are trying to be something 
valuable as a result of the value you put onto your site so as you give 
value to others, they give value to you because you become a source to 
them of value. And the more people recognize you as a source of value to 
them, the better it becomes for you, in all respects.

But that depends increasingly in this world on your ability to maintain 
control over who sees what and how. And syndication to a controlled 
netwerk of sites that agree with your vision is not a problem at all. But 
take care to recognise what is "inner circle" and what belongs to the 
"outer circle". The outer circle of you, the main public.

Personally I intend to put into my (very personal) site a form of 
intrigue. Everything is in fact publically accessible (or most of it) but 
I can give off the illusion that it is sacred or hidden material by 
providing a sense of exclusivity to those who opt to become members. That 
requires nothing more than that certain material will take more effort to 
reach for those who are not members. For example, non-members will only 
see the 5 most recent posts and will have to traverse categories to get to 
the rest.

That's intriguing. It will give people the impression that I consider my 
content valuable enough to restrict access to it, while not turning anyone 
away if they want to put the value into it to get my value out.

So it is really an illusion of exclusivity when the site is all-inclusive. 
But many commercial entities do the reverse: they provide an illusion of 
inclusivity when in fact they are very exclusive, in the sense that you 
can never become part of their inner circle. (Try to send an email to 
Google technical support, if you could, if you dared, if you envisioned 
the possibility of dreaming about that being within the realm of the 
achievable.)

So don't be Google and don't be Facebook. Facebook at least has to 
restrict access to almost everything since it is a persons site. WordPress 
falls along the same lines as Facebook mostly... but since most content is 
public to begin with, people running those public JSON webservices may end 
up being among the likes of Google if they think people offloading their 
data is a plus....

Bart.

Subject: [wp-hackers] non-ascii characters at URL and pasrsing those chars
	at string level
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2r_+3AR0yt23EDFsWoYiFytfHwRu+MBYxM7XFt=EYYJQ@mail.gmail.com>

First off, I need to get you what non-ascii chacters I'm talking about.

For instance, just type in 'Slobodan Milosevic' in Google Search and go to
the first suggested wikipedia link.

You will see that the URL contains very unusual characters that is well
beyond the common ASCII set. I'm simply curious if WordPress support that.

Though this is not a feature I particularly like (to say the least), I do
confess that I find it quite interesting from an HTTP point of view.

But my real question (or pain to better put) is this.
Say you are scraping that data and you came across that title with those
funny characers...  and you want to create a tag out of that.

Is there a conversion function that I can pass in that string and get back
the ASCII 128 or below translated version?

So I pass in 'slobodan_milo%c5%a1evi%c4%87', and I get back the good old
'Slobodan Milosevic'

Does such a function exist? Or how do you deal with that situation?

urldecode() mixed with remove_accents() perhaps?

I will look into that. your suggestion looks very promising. thank you for
that.
I also discovered this resource http://www.acc.umu.se/~saasha/charsets/ for

Thanks everyone for your input. I?ll be researching options soon. If
anyone has any other recommendations just let me know. Pros-and-Cons to
the various options but the REST APIs are, to me, the more strategic
approach but when I looked at them previously they weren?t quite there,
which is why I was jazzed when I found the push syndication plugin until I
continually realized it was similar to a lot of projects that start out
hot-n-heavy and then fall a bit to the wayside.  Good comments on security
and other such things.

Cheers,

Jeff

Message-ID: <5412B8FA.7050404@wordshell.net>

Hi,

I'm looking at collecting IP information on my servers for IP addresses 
that send comment spam.

Looking in the hooks database at http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks and 
with some Googling, it looks like the comment_post action is the best 
place to hook. I'd then need to check the comment status (see if it's 
spam), and that's about it. If I understand rightly, all plugins (like 
Akismet) that can mark a comment as spam, will have done their work by 
this point.

Does that sound right?

Many thanks,
David

Hi David,

You can get this information from $wpdb->comments. In my plugin, http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-denyhost/, I do: 

                $suspect = $this->get_IP();
                $count = (int) $wpdb->get_var( $wpdb->prepare("SELECT COUNT(comment_ID) FROM $wpdb->comments  WHERE comment_approved = 'spam' AND comment_author_IP = '%s'",$suspect) );

Hi Per,

It's real-time tracking across a large number of aggregated sites that 
I'm looking at. I use a PHP file that is invoked via auto_prepend_file 
on every site on the server, to hook relevant actions. This saves the 
effort and performance cost of manual scanning of WP installs and tables 
(and of maintaining plugins on every single site). So, it's the best 
hook that I'm really interested in.

Best wishes,
David

Message-ID: <CAMi+fEnvDhQ2+8m=DN+-Q9PyNx+anHODEGmGQfKoJExmAX6rGw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi friends,

I'd like to invite you to make a new resource
<https://github.com/ericandrewlewis/web-dev-resources/blob/master/wordpress.md>
with me, for both us and our fellow WordPress developers.

I would like this resource to be as lightweight as possible. I am not
interested at the moment in creating a new, canonical encyclopedia for
developer documentation. If we tried to, we might get excited about it,
assume some responsibility and cobble some notes together. But we would
realize the project is too ambitious. We would write some stuff, but end up
with a poor mans Codex. I'd feel sad and beaten down, and you'd feel the
time you committed to the project was a waste of time.

Therefore it will take the form of a curated collection of links, similar
to lists like these <https://github.com/dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks>.
Folks have written articles, tutorials and other forms of documentation on
specific topics around the web, in detail. Folks have created plugins that
offer awesome functionality for us. Let's make a table of contents of these
resources we find absolutely useful in our ongoing effort of being
world-class WordPress developers.

Here's the list in its current state
<https://github.com/ericandrewlewis/web-dev-resources/blob/master/wordpress.md>.
Feel free to create open up an issue sharing resources / thoughts.

To go along with this, I'm hosting a weekly chat about said resources in
our IRC channel #wordpress, Wednesdays at 1900 - 2000 UTC
<http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=19&min=00&sec=0> (3
PM Eastern).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Wordcamp Android App
Message-ID: <CAH7vCCeVDn1ABJ-KdQb9XBjs6UOGsXOW3ynGKaEbs+jZPxvnJw@mail.gmail.com>

Very enthusiastically i have started working on the  Wordcamp Andriod app.
As a first step,i am getting hands on with Wordpress Meta Environment and
WP-API ( because i think thats the API i have to rely on to fetch the
data).

After i am sure of the ways the things have to be done, i will start
working on the requirements and then  design and development.

So  it will be great if any UI designer or developer would like to join me
in this development from scratch. A team would be good for this so that we
could chalk out the plans and then have some great designs built
 conforming the material design guidelines and then it will be fun to make
the app.

Hi,

Where in WP core is the architecturally correct place to make sure that 
a specific option is never cached?

I'm not asking about how to do this via a plugin - I'm working on a 
patch to do with an issue caused by cacheing an option that would just 
be better never cached.

Best wishes,
David

Sorry for not being directly on topic, but why would something be
better-off not being cached? As long as you're using update_option() the
cache will be cleared when neceesary.

"Should never be cached" sounds like cache invalidation is your real issue.

Hi David,

You might be able to handle this with the 'pre_option_$option'
<http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/pre_option_$option&action=edit&redlink=1>
filter
- see The Codex, here,
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_option#Notes and here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Object_Cache#wp_cache_functions

Cheers,

 -- Peter

Subject: [wp-hackers] Avoiding option cacheing for a specific option

Generally speaking, seeing that there are two obvious places:

- either in the option handling routines
- or in the caching routines themselves.

You would think that the option layer would be most suitable since it is 
the calling agent, BUT, there are many routines and many of them can call 
wp_cache_set() (or wp_cache_add() ) under various circumstances.

Then the caching functionality itself becomes the proper place to 
filter... and the only thing that makes sense to me is to add a filter to:

WP_Object_Cache->set();

On the other hand, that would filter everything, not only options. Perhaps 
the only places where a new option is added is add_option and 
update_option. Then you only need to add a filter on the option name. 
There are already various filters on the option /value/ but nothing on the 
option /name/ and filtering on the value itself (you could set it to zero, 
or null) does not really semantically coincide with not wanting to set any 
value at all.

Also, there seems to be a remnant of a named filter:

$value = apply_filters( 'pre_update_option_' . $option, $value, $old_value 
);

which probably should have been

$value = apply_filters( "pre_update_option_{$option}", $value, $old_value 
);

Oh, apologies, I'm misreading. The code further down uses this latter 
syntax instead of the existing.... they are the same :p.

But I don't think you can really use that to filter the option itself. If 
you set it to null, it will just still get set, it's just getting set to 
null and retrieved as null. PHP isset() does not coincide with is_null(). 
Or "=== null". So it won't work.

So my input here would be to add a filter next to these pre_update_option 
filters called pre_update... something. On the other hand, if the option 
does not in fact exist, add_option is still called.

Then you just need to add two filters, probably, to remain with the 
current design, one general one and one named one, to add_option.

Regards,

Bart.

ps. when I wrote this I didn't much think about why you would need it. But 
I'm not sure you are referring to in-memory database-caching. There is 
also another form of caching that is sometimes used, which is storing 
calculated results as options in the option db. This form of caching can 
invalidate, so to speak, the current database contents because the 
existing 'cache' will supersede getting new results from the db. This 
makes it hard to e.g. manually change certain things such as categories in 
the DB, because category hierarchy-lists get cached and you will see like 
corrupted category lists all over WordPress. But this form of caching is 
persistent, not temporary or transient.

If, in fact, your options are getting changed from outside of WP or 
through some other means than the regular WP calls, I guess the regular 
in-memory caching could also be a problem...

Subject: [wp-hackers] Understanding some interactions between cookies,
 sessions, nonces, multisite...
Message-ID: <542015EC.6020503@wordshell.net>


I just spent a *very* dull few hours tracing a problem, whereby 
wp_create_nonce() returned a nonce which wp_verify_nonce() (running via 
AJAX) did not accept.

This happened as follows:

1) the site was a sub-folder based multisite

2) the nonce was created by a page in the network dashboard, at 
wp-admin/network/settings.php, and output in some JS on the settings page.

3) the ajaxurl JS variable being output by wp-admin/admin-header.php 
goes via the main site which in this case lived at /main, and thus 
ajaxurl was set to wp-admin/main/admin-ajax.url

4) The browser had a different wordpress_logged_in_(hex) cookie value 
for /main than for /. i.e. Two separate cookies existed in the browser. 
(The value of (hex) was the same - i.e. neither cookie lookup was empty).

5) This resulted in wp_get_session_token() returning a different value 
when the nonce was checked (via AJAX, which got the cookie whose path 
was set to /main) compared to when it was set (via the network dashboard 
page, which got the cookie whose path was set to /).

I cleared all my cookies, and logged in via /wp-login.php again. Same 
happened. Both cookies returned.

This site had this in its wp-config.php:

define('ADMIN_COOKIE_PATH', '/');
define('COOKIE_DOMAIN', '');
define('COOKIEPATH', '');
define('SITECOOKIEPATH', '');

After removing those lines, clearing cookies, and logging in again, 
there was only one cookie, and everything worked.

This only breaks things on recent WP versions where 
wp_get_session_token() is used in nonces.

I'm familiar with AJAX and nonces, but WP's login stuff is not something 
I'm familiar with.
The questions I don't understand the answers too are:

1) Why my customer might have had those defines in his wp-config.php, and
2) Why this breaks things in this way, and
3) Is this a bug?

Best wishes,
David
