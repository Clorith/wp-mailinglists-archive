Message-ID: <674b4a3b0605312253x3f2d552cye0aa582e067a07c4@mail.gmail.com>

The delete_user action hook fires off right *after* the user has been
deleted from the users and usermeta tables.

Wouldn't it make more sense to fire it off before the actual deletion?
 That way you could retrieve usermeta values and decide whether to
perform some other action, such as deleting a record from a custom
table.

Actually, that's what the delete_post action hook does now: it fires
off before the actual deletion.  Why not do the same for delete_user?

Yes, although moving established hooks can break old plugins, so  
we're probably better off just creating a new hook.

pre_delete_user ?

Before adding another one a quick grep (actually it's usually a slow 
grep) of the wp-plugins repo can tell you if in reality anyone has 
actually used it.

Hi,

what speaks against two hooks? IMHO, every action such as deleting 
or creating a user, deleting or editing a post etc should have 
at least two actions. 

- user_delete 
Activated before the user gets deleted so plugins may cancel the action

- user_deleted 
Activated after the user has been deleted, but only on success so 
plugins can remove additional user data. The old userinfo should be 
given as a parameter

Better example for posts:

- post_save
Plugins may modify the content of the post

- post_saved
Plugins may perform a pingback (not the best example, I know) with the 
final post data (permalink and so on)


Best regards,

  Arne Brachhold

Also, for a fresh install:

# svn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.0

Or for an existing svn checkout (this will update you to the latest 2.0 
branch version and also reset your checkout to point at the correct 
branch location):

# svn switch http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.0

Then on the next new 2.0 release it's as easy as:

# svn up

It may be worth it to get svn installed just to avoid the possible head 
trauma induced by making a 2000+ line unified diff work.  That is, if 
you're already using a command line.

You can also use SVN to update a WP install that isn't already a SVN  
checkout... merely checkout WP to a different directory and then export.

# svn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.0/ wordpress- 
checkout/
# svn export --force wordpress-checkout/ actual-wp-install/

AFAIK you don't need that initial checkout just do:

# svn export --force http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.0/
actual-wp-install/

I often get that error too, but then 1AND1 DB servers are not always the
most responsive. It still seems to happen more often than I would expect.
Especially on such a simple statement.

Any more, I just hit post and then navigate away allowing WP to go off and
finish its thing on the server on its own.  If I get an error, there's not
much I can do about it anyway...

Someday we will have a hook every other line:

do_action('wp-includes_functionsphp_line87');
...
do_action('wp-includes_functionsphp_line89');

do_action and apply_filters are very fast. They might be called
several hundred times and have a marginal effect on load times. Adding
a few dozen hooks would not cause a noticeable difference in
performance. IIRC.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress 2.0.3 Tuneup Plugin
Message-ID: <A6085FAC-9E08-4484-858C-68CD41F4EC24@txfx.net>

Mdawaffe and I found three rather annoying bugs in WP 2.0.3 after  
release:

- Comment edit form isn't nonced properly, so you get "Are you sure?"  
dialog [1]
- "Are you sure?" dialog leaves extra slashes in the forwarded  
content [2]
- After editing comments, you aren't forwarded to the correct  
location [3]

In order to hold people over until the next 2.0.x release (if there  
even is one), I wrote a plugin that fixes these issues.

http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/wordpress-203-tuneup/

Basically, it implements the fixes that Mdawaffe, Ryan and I worked  
on, but in a plugin, without modifying any core files (note to  
Mdawaffe: it even makes the nonce match update-comment_$comment_ID  
like in your patch).

This plugin is hardcoded to only work with WP version 2.0.3, so when  
you upgrade to the next version, it'll become non-functional.  Let me  
know if you have any feedback.  If any more annoying bugs like this  
are found in 2.0.3 that can be fixed from a plugin, I might consider  
updating it.

Matt/Podz,
If you get a lot of flak about these bugs, you might consider  
pointing people to this plugin via the forums or the development blog.

Nice.  In addition to being non-functional, you might consider having  
it deactivate itself if ( '2.0.3' != get_bloginfo('version') ).  Just  
because you can :)

In this same thread of thought, I'm also looking to move the 
delete_attachment action hook before the actual deletion in 
wp_delete_attachment.  I create 2 thumbnails and I can't delete the 2nd 
one because I have no way of accessing the attachment's meta data.  Or a 
"pre_delete_attachment" hook would be fine, too.  I'm wondering how many 
other functions present a similar plugin capability issue?

I'll submit a patch for my issue, but have we decided on the accepted 
route?  Do I move the delete_attachment action or add a new action for 
pre_delete_attachment?  IMHO, having delete_attachment after the delete 
code really serves no purpose.  How do I grep the Plugin Repository to 
see if it's being used?  Thanks!

Are we to see future bugs fixed via plugins or is this some kind of
special case? How come this isn't being entered as a patch, or has it,
and I'm just not paying close enough attention?

Taking flak about bugs is one thing, but fixing bugs with plugins is
messing with my WP-user brain.

Regardless, your efforts to fix these issues is much appreciated, no
matter what method is used to squish the pesky bugs.

It does serve a purpose - like Arne said, you might want your code only 
to execute if the deletion was successful, whereas a pre_delete_user 
hook would be useful if you want your code executing regardless of 
whether the deletion is successful.

Since there's no practical reason why there should be two hooks, why not 
just add 'em?

It will (I should hope!) be added into the core, it's just releasing 
2.0.3 and then 2.0.4 a day later will be annoying to users, especially 
since the changes are relatively minor. Users affected by the bugs can 
just use the plugin to tide them over until the actual release :)

Which subsequently reminds me of past conversations in the wp-testers
list where it was suggested that a more formal testing regime be
developed and adopted for incidents like this.

Each of the bugs has been patched in both the 2.0 branch and the  
trunk (alpha) version of the code.  But you're right; a new, patched  
*release* has not been offered.

I agree, and this time the elapsed time between beta and release was
really short, so short that only today was released the tags on i18n
SVN for the 2.0.3 pot.

This it's good cause now locales release will be released using the
pathced 2.0.3 but this mean a lot of people already doenloaded the
english unpatched and now do download again and update again sound
relly weird.

They were fixed in SVN first.

I could have offered a brand new download... but "hacked" versions of  
WP have historically had a low adoption rate.  It also would require  
overwriting no less than three core WordPress files.  The idea with  
the plugin is that "it's just a plugin."  People are not overwhelmed  
by a plugin like they are by "A NEW VERSION OF WORDPRESS!" or  
"HACKING CORE FILES!"  This plugin fixes specific issues, and is  
designed for general consumption, not just by the wp-hackers crowd.

It also means that when the next version of WP comes along, people  
can upgrade using SVN or by applying a patch and not have to worry  
that their patch isn't going to apply cleanly because of any  
modifications they might have made to the core code.

Ryan  announced the availability of a candidate on the 31st of May,  IIRC.
This  was  posted  to  wp-testers, but there  was  no  apparent  response.
Therefore, I doubt many people bothered to 'knock' on it.

Maybe  there ought to be some incentives or hype, much as in the Bug  Hunt
(with  or without bounty) last year. I personally lost some motivation due
to  decreased  response  and  activity on Trac. While  I  still  have  the
nightlies  (re-)installed  every  night,  I rarely take them  for  a  spin
anymore.

Best wishes,

Roy

Hello All,

 

I'm not entirely certain this is the right place to put this, is wp-hackers
only for code-related discussions? 

In the WP Admin CP, the dev-blog posts are dated as "XX days ago," I'm just
thinking that it might be more 'in our best interests' to use either fuzzy
dates or MM/DD/YY seeing as the days-ago count can go up pretty high.

Isn't it more annoying to the users who have not yet upgraded?
There are already known problems, but not a fixed release, just
because "it would be too soon"?

Personally I'd appreciate being able to upgrade directly from 2.0.2 to
2.0.4 (or whatever release that has been there for a while without
any bugs), without having to wait.

Numbers (in the version) are cheap.  (Preparing the zip and tar.gz
files is not so cheap, but that wasn't cited as the reason...)

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

IIRC, the message was posted in the evening, and WP 2.0.3 was  
released early the next morning.  It's not a matter of people not  
bothering... more a matter of them waking up, reading their e-mail,  
and realizing that it had already been released.  It was a wholly  
inadequate amount of time for people to test out the release.  What  
we need is the following:

- announcement on wp-hackers and wp-testers about availability of a  
release candidate.  This should represent Matt and Ryan's proposed  
final version.
- people should install it as soon as they can, and report any  
critical bugs.  Matt and Ryan need to make themselves available  
during this time to screen the bug reports and commit the patches.
- once people have been running the release candidate for a period of  
not less than 72 hours, and are happy with it, it should be released.

Maybe it could go into XX months ago at a certain point.

Of course, the better solution would be to have more frequent  
Development blog posts! :-D

quite summer.. all this could justify that people will take some days

Passiong from beta to release in one day after is not a beta test

recently appeared better to releasse a patch with only the 2 or 3
modified files than a whole new release.

How  about  'tiering'  them? Either using categories or by  separation  to
different  blogs.  At the moment, in order to get insight into less  major
(or  severe) announcements, one needs to syndicate blogs of the  principal
developers,  notably Matt and Ryan. There are several existing sites  that
offer  different  feeds, which compose different amounts  of  information,
depending  on importance. As I perceive it, to keep track of WordPress one
needs to:

|  * Subscribe to WordPress.org
|  * Subscribe to WordPress developer blogs
|    (feeds filtered by category/search)
|  * Subscribe to trac/svn mailing lists
|  * Subscribe to developers mailing lists
|  * Subscribe to support forums
|  * ...
v

Lower 'signal-to-noise' ratio

But the question remains, no matter who's blogs you subscribe to, what will
be the 'default' WP-Admin Center posts? I think Fuzzy Dates might work.

I don't really see the national holiday as being the reason, I think the
biggest and most important change you could make to be sure it gets
attention is make a dev blog post about it, so that *every single* WP
Blogger sees it in their Admin CP, give them 2-3 days, then release. We're
in no hurry to get the versions out, after 60 days 2 more won't matter. A RC
is stable enough for the majority of bloggers that know how to upgrade to
test it out, many people don't bother with mailing lists, but nevertheless
_would_ enjoy or appreciate testing an RC.

Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.64.0606021554240.5341@www.provisio.net>

Hi all,

I'd like to enhance my category access plugin to not only hide posts in
specific categories, but also to hide comments associated with those
posts.

- Is there any notion of authentication for the RSS comments feed?
- Is there a hook for the comments list that I can filter out a comment
   based on the visibility of its associated post?

If the answer to the first question is "no, and there won't be one" then I
guess I could hide any comment that isn't public to everyone, or maybe
have a separate setting for comments lists.

David

It's not a "buggy version," it's a version that wasn't perfect.
It's not a security issue, it's not the end of the world, it's an
inconvenience and that's about it.
All it takes is another release, no more, no less. Problem solved.

problem = bugs then it's a buggy version.... and this happened jusst
cause from beta to release ther was only few hours.

Yes it's not the end of the world, but any new version mean for users
have to download and reinstall it, for people give support get tons of
questions, for locales team generate another release, lot of unusefull
work.

Sometimes people oin this list have to think as normal users do, they
do not update theyr site using SVN, they are not often used tomanage
files on FTP all the time, some have slow connection and donload
unpacjk and upload take time... and all this is necessary ofr waht?
Nothing just some imperfection that 2 or 3 more days of beta test
period would have avoided.

For Italian locale we are going to realese the patched 2.0.3 then
there is no problem but this just cause I was unable to generate the
locale immediatrly after the english release as I usually do, or  yes
another release will be necessary

If you think that having 2 rlease in one week sounds good.. ok.. I
dounbt it is, just for the image of the software

AFAIK the zip didn't get updated.

And it shouldn't be updated - the one time that happened providing
support in #wordpress was a nightmare you didn't have any hope in
matching the line numbers in peoples error messages with the lines in
your local copy of the source you downloaded a few hours earlier

Take out the first / in the rewrite rule. You are already starting at
the base.

It should look like this:
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^blog/_archives/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)\.html$

OK.. There are three issues right?

- Comment edit form isn't nonced properly, so you get "Are you sure?"
dialog [1]
OK.. 1 extra prompt on a relatively rare action (for most WP bloggers) -
that's probably not worth the risk of immediately fixing.  If a major
problem is fond in the next week that requires a prompt fix.  Then
version 2.0.5 would REALLY annoy people with WP farms.  I'd think Matt
would be wise to let us try to break this release for at least a week.

- "Are you sure?" dialog leaves extra slashes in the forwarded content
[2]
I don't see this behavior at all.  Though, I am using a custom permalink
mapping. So, perhaps this is specific to a certain permalink style?
Which style do you see this under?

- After editing comments, you aren't forwarded to the correct location
[3]
Likewise, I do get forwarded to the correct places when I am editing
from the Manage comments screen and from the post as well.  
Is the error on Yes or No?  Both work fine on my blog.  Where do you get
sent instead?

If the aim is to redirect and not just map the old URL onto the new
content, there should be an R flag in there.

The code with the problems has been in testing for weeks, possibly as 
long as a month. The code was new to the 2.0 branch, but the bugs were 
identical in the 2.1 SVN, which supposedly has more testers. (A 
surprising number of people run off trunk, including all of the active 
contributers I know of. However those folks, including me, seem to miss 
or ignore bugs sometimes.)

The lack of people testing SVN is part of the reason I've been 
encouraging frequent syncs of SVN to the WP.com live site, because that 
has so many people using it even obscure bugs get reported very quickly.

However because of Donncha's wedding and honeymoon, we hadn't synced the 
codebase in about a month (before nonces were added) so these seemingly 
obvious things weren't caught.

Testing is not sexy! We've tried writing guides, mailing lists, nightly 
builds, short betas, really long betas, nothing that has been suggested 
hasn't been tried. At the end of the day, more people using every little 
part of the system every day is the only way that has consistently kept 
development pretty stable. On the downside, it's a lot more work to 
constantly sync and it often makes WP.com less stable.

That was a long-winded way of saying I've finally found something that I 
think works, but has some drawbacks. The same thing could be replicated 
on a smaller scale by any dedicated developer who hosts blogs for 5-20 
friends.

Very true, we can roll up these and any other bug / security fixes that 
come up for another release in the 2.0 series in about a month or so.

(Sorry to respond just to your email, this was something a few people 
have brought up in the thread.)

Of course. It'd be great for some parts of WP, like XML-RPC or wp-mail, 
and difficult or impossible for others. I know there are ways to 
automate browser actions and test that way, but it's a little beyond me.

But the problem is that not everyone can reproduce these bugs, Mark.
Per Brian's email, it seems that there is a randomness associated with these
bugs. I'm going to do a fresh install on my local server, and try different
revisions of WP and see what happens.

Had a quick play around with PHP Simple Test[1] and it looks fairly
easy to do with that, though JavaScript would be out of the question.

   http://rephrase.net/miscellany/06/atest.phps

That class contains two tests, one for making a new post, and one
making a new post with the AYS message. The first just sets the title
and content, submits the form, and checks for the "Post saved"
message. The second unsets the nonce[2] so as to always get the "are
you sure?" prompt, submits, checks to see if the AYS has come up, then
submits that and again checks for "Post saved".

They're both fairly useless and brittle, but not difficult to write.
The hard part would be coming up with decent tests to implement. :)

The Nonce bugs are, by their nature, 100% reproducible.

The AYS slashing bug *should* be 100% reproducible.  WP includes code  
to normalize things like register_globals and magic quotes.  To test,  
edit a comment with a regular straight quote in it  (using stock  
2.0.3 and not having my plugin enabled).  You should get (a) AYS  
dialog and then (b) slashes before any straight quotes in the comment.

the only one I'm not so sure about is the comment editing redirection  
bug.  You'll have to talk to Michael Adams about that, he reported it.

OK, I will try that out.
Yes, the nonce bugs are reproducible as far as the AYS page goes. I thought
it was a "feature" at first, hence my lack of reporting.
But, yeah, the redirect and slashing I have yet to see... and I have tens of
comments a day to change on my blog... However:

Did you ever see the dialog box I'm talking about? I think it was the 2.0.3
codebase, basically on clicking "edit" for a comment, and then I get a popup
box with a message in it... can't for the life of me remember what was in
it, I'll see if I can track it down.

I can verify the last two are the same on my blog.
*But* I had a different error, when editing a comment, I'd get a popup box
that says 
"" is not something
I don't get it in the current SVN, so I think it was nonce code on the
fritz.

OK.. There are three issues right?

- Comment edit form isn't nonced properly, so you get "Are you sure?"
dialog [1]
OK.. 1 extra prompt on a relatively rare action (for most WP bloggers) -
that's probably not worth the risk of immediately fixing.  If a major
problem is fond in the next week that requires a prompt fix.  Then version
2.0.5 would REALLY annoy people with WP farms.  I'd think Matt would be wise
to let us try to break this release for at least a week.

- "Are you sure?" dialog leaves extra slashes in the forwarded content [2] I
don't see this behavior at all.  Though, I am using a custom permalink
mapping. So, perhaps this is specific to a certain permalink style?
Which style do you see this under?

- After editing comments, you aren't forwarded to the correct location [3]
Likewise, I do get forwarded to the correct places when I am editing from
the Manage comments screen and from the post as well.  
Is the error on Yes or No?  Both work fine on my blog.  Where do you get
sent instead?

I can imagine the issues involved in releasing another build, but like I
said earlier, this isn't a very big bug, and I guess there is no hurry to
get it fixed. ATM anyone that knows about the bug knows about Mark's
plug-in, so it's not as big of an issue as it seems.

But this can be seen as a good thing, I mean, we obviously have serious
issues in testing WP, and this brings them to light. This time it's a simple
annoyance bug, next time it might not be. I'm really guilty here, I've been
running SVN for the longest time, and hacking the hell out of WP, but never
reporting back, but I've resolved to change :D

There are a lot of people running the SVN as you said, but the trick is to
get them to report back. Post on the dev blog, make it clear that WP is a
community project that needs the help of everyone involved. I have been
contacted by many people that found WP bugs, but they didn't realize it.
Most geek bloggers enjoy the bragging rights that come with SVN, but aren't
comfortable with mailing lists. To be honest, WP support forums aren't the
easiest way to report bugs. Make it _easier_ for John Q. Public who happens
to run SVN or RC to report back, and that might make all the difference.

The code with the problems has been in testing for weeks, possibly as long
as a month. The code was new to the 2.0 branch, but the bugs were identical
in the 2.1 SVN, which supposedly has more testers. (A surprising number of
people run off trunk, including all of the active contributers I know of.
However those folks, including me, seem to miss or ignore bugs sometimes.)

The lack of people testing SVN is part of the reason I've been encouraging
frequent syncs of SVN to the WP.com live site, because that has so many
people using it even obscure bugs get reported very quickly.

However because of Donncha's wedding and honeymoon, we hadn't synced the
codebase in about a month (before nonces were added) so these seemingly
obvious things weren't caught.

Testing is not sexy! We've tried writing guides, mailing lists, nightly
builds, short betas, really long betas, nothing that has been suggested
hasn't been tried. At the end of the day, more people using every little
part of the system every day is the only way that has consistently kept
development pretty stable. On the downside, it's a lot more work to
constantly sync and it often makes WP.com less stable.

That was a long-winded way of saying I've finally found something that I
think works, but has some drawbacks. The same thing could be replicated on a
smaller scale by any dedicated developer who hosts blogs for 5-20 friends.

Very true, we can roll up these and any other bug / security fixes that come
up for another release in the 2.0 series in about a month or so.

(Sorry to respond just to your email, this was something a few people have
brought up in the thread.)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Bulit in Bug Reporter?!
Message-ID: <000001c687e4$22ec42c0$68c4c840$@net>

Just had a quick thought:

While we're on the topic of getting more feedback from testers that wouldn't
normally bother to post back:
Would it be possible to add a tab to the main view in the ACP (next to the
dashboard) that's called "Bug Reporter" or "Feedback" or something, and have
a simple form that either sends an email, saves a file, or better yet,
submits requests via POST to the WP Trac?

 

IMHO this would be a sure way to win the feedback reports. Although there is
a fear that users will abuse this system and report misconfigurations or
support issues there, I think you can either only include it in RC and SVN
and not in final releases, or else have 'moderators' that verify bugs before
they reach Trac (if we end up going with Trac of course).

 

Just a thought..

That would be very cool, especially if it was something that was active 
in SVN but not in releases. Maybe it could activate off "alpha" or 
"beta" in the version string.

Yeah, lol... can't believe I didn't think of that. A simple IF statement
could take care of that.
It would obviously entail quite a bit of work, but I'm willing to help on
that, and I think the benefits would be well worth it for the WP team.

There is a "beta" forum @ the support forum.  When 2.0 was released beta, it
was used.  Perhaps there was more buzz around that, than, say, a maintenance
release would, but I monitor the forums regularly enough to be able to keep
what is and what isn't beta related from that forum (as do others).  If
testers were encouraged to use that for future alpha/beta testing,  then it
may prove to be another useful source of info.  It simply means those that
are working on the code visit that forum and comment on issues brought up by
testers. ( I don't believe currently a forum can have it's own feed, but if
that was tweaked, then keeping tabs would be a little easier).

way or another gets major recognition. That being said, Wordpress made

Message-ID: <b3522afe0606050901s2e043fd1u4a76b1e0053a144d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm developing a photo gallery plugin for WP and I would make it
compatible both with 1.5.X and 2.0.X version.

The problem I have is this:

1) if the user install the plugin while the main blog has permalinks
not active, the plugin works. In the same way: 2) if the user install
the plugin while the main blog has permalinks active, the plugin works
(the plugin setup check if permalinks are active and if they are, add
its rewrite rules to .htaccess)

The problem occurs with case 1): I've a blog with no permalinks, I
active the photo gallery plugin, later I active the permalinks on my
blog: the plugin does not work because the rewrite rules for the
plugin are not set.

I would try to hook when the user updates the Permalink Options, so I
can generate and add the plugin rules to htaccess, but I need to know
if there is a hook available when Permalink Options are updated,
compatible also with 1.5.X versions, or at least a workaround.

Thanks!

here's your first tester :D the existing WP-G2 plug-in is quite buggy!

If you filter rewrite_rules_array don't they automatically get 
added/updated when the user updates their permalinks?

No, I don't filter the rewrite rules, because I don't yet understand
how they work.
I've posted an help request in this list some months ago, I've read
the Codex examples but I' dont' resolved :-)

Now I'm using this function to make WP use .htaccess the old way also
with 2.0.x versions.

function GYO_verbose_rewrite() { // thanks to Ryan Boren ;-)
	global $wp_rewrite;
	$wp_rewrite->use_verbose_rules = true;
}

add_action('init', 'GYO_verbose_rewrite');

No Computer Guru, I'm sorry

My plugin is Galleryo (notice the final o) :-)
If you are interested, you find it in my web site, it works with WP 1.5.X.

I stopped developing because it does not work with 2.0.x versions
(rewrite rules), but now I'm trying to update it, perhaps I found a
solution with rewrite rules, but I need a Hook!!! :-)

This is how I do it:

First, add some WP_Rewrite variables:

/**
 * Registers our query vars so we can redirect to the library and book 
permalinks.
 * @param array $vars The existing array of query vars
 * @return array The modified array of query vars with our additions.
 */
function nr_query_vars( $vars ) {
    $vars[] = 'now_reading_library';
    return $vars;
}
add_filter('query_vars', 'nr_query_vars');

Then add our rewrite rules:

/**
 * Adds our rewrite rules for the library and book permalinks to the 
regular WordPress ones.
 * @param array $rules The existing array of rewrite rules we're filtering
 * @return array The modified rewrite rules with our additions.
 */
function nr_mod_rewrite( $rules ) {
    global $wp_rewrite;
    $rules['library/?$'] = 'index.php?now_reading_library=true';
    return $rules;
}
add_filter('rewrite_rules_array', 'nr_mod_rewrite');

Now we can check on `init`/`template_redirect` to see if our rewrite 
variables are set and load the appropriate templates:

/**
 * Checks to see if the library/book permalink query vars are set and, 
if so, loads the appropriate templates.
 */
function library_init() {
    global $wp, $wpdb, $q, $query;
   
    $wp->parse_request();
   
    if( $wp->query_vars['now_reading_library'] ) {
        // Library page:
        load_template(dirname(__FILE__).'/templates/library.php');
        die;
    } else
        return;
}
add_action('template_redirect', 'library_init');

(Sorry for the rather verbose examples, btw)

It's pretty complex but fairly intuitive.

Incidentally, does anyone (David?) know what's happening about the 
WP_Rewrite API as discussed here[1]?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Disable the G-Zip Button
Message-ID: <000401c688c3$52c1f140$f845d3c0$@net>

Is it possible to disable the GZip button in the Options | Reading dialog? A
plug-in I'm working on requires GZip to be dealt with internally, so we need
to disable the GZip option in WordPress.

I currently have it asking users to turn off GZip first, but I'd rather be
able to disable it automatically, since most user complaints stem from not
having that set right.

 

Thanks!

Thanks Rob for the example :-) very clear.
I'll try in these days to apply it to the plugin.

So, in this way I can skip to use the function

$wp_rewrite->use_verbose_rules = true; ??

Thanks again

It's an option named "gzipcompression."

Doesn't that option turn GZip on or off? I need to disable the button
itself.

Oh, sorry.  I misunderstood what you were asking.  The checkbox is
coded into wp-admin/options-reading.php, so you'll probably need to
use output buffering to make it disappear.

Yes it does

If you really need to disable the button rather than just forcing the
option to off then you will have to output buffer the options page and
preg_replace it out.

But it would be easier to hook on 'init' or 'plugins_loaded' and force
the option off every time

Subject: [wp-hackers] Introduction + Mac-specific pointer
Message-ID: <2D62BF75-B874-4465-A3BA-4B9D531D2BCD@red-sweater.com>


Hi everybody, my name is Daniel Jalkut and I'm just getting my feet  
wet with WordPress hacking.  I spend most of my time doing Mac  
desktop software engineering.

I had been wondering for a long time where the "developers hangout"  
was for WordPress, so I hope I've found it.  I often wonder why  
things behave a certain way or another so I hope that by lurking here  
for a little while I'll pick up by osmosis some of the design  
constraints of the project, and eventually be more suited to making  
my own submittable changes.

I've been running WordPress on my blog for almost a year now and have  
generally been very happy. To facilitate better understanding of the  
technical side of the project, and to put my mind at ease about  
updating my site with latest public releases, I've put together a  
pretty comprehensive set up where my live web site and local Mac  
share access to a repository with several working copies of the  
WordPress sources in them.

If you're working on WordPress from a Mac, you might find my blog  
entry detailing this setup and integration with Apple's Xcode  
interesting:

http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/141/livin-in-a-wordpress-hackers- 
paradise

Also since I'm pretty naive I may have overlooked some easier way to  
accomplish some of the goals I was seeking. Let me know if you have  
any advice for how to better streamline the "sandboxing" of  
development copies of WordPress and integrating with live deployments.

Daniel

Subject: [wp-hackers] archives API
Message-ID: <28878810606051210g73834613i7ba82690277c9cff@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been looking around for some plugin to get the archives in a cool way.
I've seen the super-archives-plugin [1] and some other, but all of these
failed my requirements: they all need javascript enabled to work. Then I
realized that archives API cannot provide data to make the archives looking
cool. I struggled with the wp-includes/template-functions-general.php and
more concisely with wp_get_archives & get_archives functions to get what I
needed. Below are the code of the modified functions, and the code of a page
(template) I made for showing up the archives (still need to be css'ed and
javascript'ed). You can see it working at
http://www.thinkingrid.com/blog/?page_id=7 . It's possible to add this (or
similar functionality) to the wordpress core?

Here it is a list of changes and the source code for the modified functions
below (I'm sorry I don't know how to make a patch using diff):

+ Added option 'yearly' to the $type parameter.
Do you need me to explain this? ;-)

+ Added option 'array' to the $format parameter.
A bidimensional array is returned.
$arr[0]: Numeric year, month or day, with leading zeros. This depends on
$type parameter. On weekly or postbypost it's the text of the link (I didn't
need anything in this case).
$arr[1] = Link to the archives with get_archives_link( ... );

+ Added parameters $before_day and $after_day.
To get posts published between $after_day and $before_day. They are strings
representing mysql DATETIME format.

+ Added the show_post_count option to the $type=daily.

I think these are all the changes I made. I think all changes I added are
embedded in <kiusap> and </kiusap> tags.

[1] Super-archives plugin:

The redirection bug only surfaces if you have disabled sending referrers
or if the HTTP_REFERER value is otherwise empty.  Click edit on some
comment and then hit enter from your browser's location bar to reload the
page without sending a REFERER header to test.

Oh.. But that's to be expected, since it's called a redirection bug anyway,
right?
Because it's far easier and lighter for you in PHP to send a page back to
the refer than it is to add a POST to the original page and have the next
page implement it.. and as it is WP is quite slow (relatively speaking).

Thank you! No one else seemed to want to provide any additional information
on this!

Assuming these steps to duplicate work, I would still like to know where the
extra slashes appear (issue [2]).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Securing a part of WordPress structure
Message-ID: <9687671E-4DBD-4ADD-A9E5-D53B22A17211@codehooligans.com>

Greeting all, Happy Monday.

Have a question. A client need to password protect a section of their  
site. They currently have just static HTML content setup on a server.  
They are using htaccess protection via Apache. Considering WordPress  
does not use physical directories is there a way to 'lock-down' an  
entire category or nested page hierarchy?

Not clear? Consider this. The client has the following site structure.

/
/projects/
/projects/admin/            ? Protect from here and all folders under  
admin
/projects/admin/docs
/projects/summer/
/blogs/
/blogs/life
/blogs/after-life
/aboutus/
/aboutus/privacy/

I know they can password protect the page by assigning a password.  
But they want to traditional popup box for username and password. I'm  
not aware of plugin that offers this functionality.

We're not going to patch 2.0.3 and then leave it as "2.0.3"  That  
would invite all sorts of chaos and confusion.  2.0.3 is 2.0.3...  
forever.  Changes are going into /branches/2.0/ which is what you  
should download if you want a patched version of 2.0.3

It's just a weird list in general.  It small sampling could include several
monitors, digital cameras, a couple CPUs, some desktop apps and some web
services (ones that I refuse to use - Google desktop, Flikr and Blogger
amongst them). The whole thing is just strange.  I know I'd rank WordPress's
usefulness in my life higher than that of a touch screen monitor... but how
should you compare apples to oranges anyway?

Hey Paul,

Personally, I'd just use a location directive in the apache config, if you
have access to it. If not, it shouldn't be that hard to write a plugin. PHP
does support basic authentication, after all. It just seems like kind of
annoying to have to add a plugin for that, imho.

Okay, back to lurking,

No need to run update_option() on each load, just change the value as  
it comes out of the database.

We have a lot of discussion here about the general direction of

That's really cool!  I'm definitely going to try that out.  Looks

Along the same lines... the whole Wordpress SVN can no longer be checked 
out (http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress) Each of the individual folders 
(branches, tags, trunk) need to be checked out seperately.

This never used to happen before and I'm not sure when it started 
happening. This has also been confirmed by others. It reports back that 
it can't do a PROPFIND request and also reports back a weird 301 moved 
permanently error. However, you can load it up in your browser and 
navigate through it that way.

I did this by hooking into the 'the_posts' filter and unsetting a post
(and printing an error message) if it was under a category for which
the current user doesn't have permission to view.

I'm writing a plugin for users to write specific types of posts and pages.
For example, provide write subpanels for "post experiment" and "write

post" subpanel has except that the input field is pre-filled with some
text.  I'll appreciate any suggestion for implementing this feature in a

I'm developing a plugin for wordpress which involves an advanced search
since the blog will be used for 'status reporting'.  Since the search is
outside of the loop, I'm wondering... is there any hooks which will run so
that in a page template running outside of the loop, I can put a quicktag
such as <!--advanced search-->?  I just can't seem to find the tag to put

Looks to be WP with a modded admin system, a bunch of custom plugins, and

(or GPL issues) but thought I'd bring it to the attention of folks around

There are a few sites Flip has developed that obviously have things like 
'wp-content/themes/...' in the HTML, though they've done a simply awesome 
job making it look like a custom site.  They have some real freaking talent 
on-board, imho.

I guess if they develop and host the sites (and basically 'own' the code 
themselves in all cases), there's no GPL issue?  But if they are actually 
selling it as a purchasable 'shrinkwrap' package for people to install 
themselves, then Flip would need to make modified code (at least the core, 
I'll leave plugins out of this) available, no?  Again, the difference is 
between 'use' of code yourself, vs 'sale' of code (or binary) to others, 
right?

Anyway, just though hackers could use some thought-provoking discussion --  
please don't go way off tangent on this, stay on topic. ;)

They're only obligated to pass on code changes to those they distribute
the software to, i.e., their customers.

I will allow, though, that their fairly blatant rip of WordPress and

Yeah, but check out the Datasheet PDF, the Plugin Management screenshot 
says "Plugins extend and expand the functionality of Wordpress..."  "If 
something goes wrong with a plugin and you can't use Wordpress..."

Doesn't look like they're working that hard to hide the Wordpress core.

I've developed something like this for my own company, but I'm not 
arrogant enough to take credit for something I didn't write myself.  My 
clients know they are getting a modified and extended version of the WP 
core.  And they're made aware of the fact that the code is open-source 
and licensed GPL.

Doug is right though, they don't have to release the source to the 
public, just their customers.  And nothing in the GPL says you can't 
charge for it.

Their "Menu Manager" and "Ecommerce" plugins are exactly what I'm in the 
middle of working on.  I'm a little bummed they beat me to it.  :-)  
They are smart in making it a completely streamlined and integrated 
package.  Often times trying to use an independently developed WP plugin 
for professional clients produces poor results, if you know what I mean.

Gotta give them props, though.

Best regards,

Ryan Scheuermann

Huh.  Really.  Okay...

I just re-read the GPL stuff.  That was a point I didn't quite understand, 
an now do.  I'll explain my confusion and the 'resolution' as I see it. ;)

I thought if you sold GPL code/binary you had to make sources available to 
the public.  THAT WAS WRONG.  You do NOT have to make modded sources 
available to just anyone who asks.

HOWEVER, you DO have to make sources freely available to anyone who 
purchased the GPL-based 'product' from you -- in fact, there must be a 
'written offer' accompanying any GPL binary offering to provide source code 
for free.  AND, since it is GPL, those people may then freely distribute the 
source code all they want.

| I will allow, though, that their fairly blatant rip of WordPress and
| their failure to acknowledge this in their documentation IS pretty skeevy.

That's something I can't really find covered in GPL.  I mean, I believe that 
original license and copyright must come with sources -- though, it might 
only NEED to exist in the license/copyright file itself.  I can't find any 
particular rules of attribution (like that original copyright notices should 
be in every source file, or a modified source file must contain some 
attribution to the original copyright, etc.).

Ah well, this is a good learning experience. ;)

This is similar to a discussion I followed on this list before:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-July/001836.html

or

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wordpress.devel/3206/focus=3229

I'm not sure what the end result was - I think it was OK, but maybe because
the plugins used were made available. This case seems a little different
because it's semi-hidden that this is Wordpress. My personal feeling is that
this is somewhat uncool, but is unlikely to cause a huge issue. However, I
think it's the devs that have to make that decision. Nice to have the
discussion. I wish the GPL was more clear about this sort of stuff.

Guess I don't understand why you wouldn't want to own up to its WP
roots, though.  Imagine being able to say "based on code in use by over
300,000 sites".  Or "core engine tested by millions of users every day".
Or "core engine proven to handle some of the largest sites around".

Seems to me that by trying to hide their WP roots they are only hurting
themselves.  I think "proudly based on WordPress" would have a whole lot
more meaning, market-push, etc.  And it wouldn't get all the rest of the
WP fanatics (like me) wanting to puke.

As it is, I don't know how they sleep at night...

Just my $0.02,

Two things from the pdf datasheet caught my attention:

1) "requires Firefox to administrate"
2) From the icon that appears in the screenshots on the upper right,
I'm guessing there's a way to lock checked-out content while editing.
That--or at least the plugin hooks to make it easier to implement--is
something that I'd like to see in WordPress.

Good point. I'm pretty sure that Plugins come with licenses and copyrights
of their own - which almost certainly require attribution.

Hmm. Not so sure. Sec 2(b) suggests that plugins too, if distributed as part
of the product, would be under GPL:

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third

How it is distributed, does not really matter.
Assuming Matt's team of lawyers don't disagree. ;)  That section means that
unless the plug-ins contain code originally contained in WordPress, they
don't have to be GPL.  

IMHO, licensing is up to the individual plug-in author UNLESS the plug-in
includes a WP unit.  If  the plug-in pulls in ANY WP code, /then/ it in part
contains a GPL licensed product and therefore must be GPL'd.

I don't think they do - I'm pretty sure the GPL makes some sort of 
distinction about how the code is used in the larger project. If it's 
forked as a separate process from a binary I think it's ok, but if it's 
executed like WP plugins are then the license must be GPL-compatible. I 
can't remember exactly how it goes, though.

Actually, the whole plugins licensing thing was a topic I was trying to 
avoid. :)

The section you noted is really referring to 'the work' meaning 'the work 
that was originally GPL licensed and modified'.  Plugins can obviously be 
'works' of their own, separate from 'the work' that is WordPress (just my 
opinion -- there are opposing ones...).  However, a later section notes you 
could have GPL and non-GPL 'works' side by side, distributed together, and 
that's fine by the GPL, it doesn't 'taint' either set.  At what point are 
'two works' actually one is a gray area at best.  There are some black and 
white areas when it comes to compiled code, but even with binaries there are 
some grat areas... And the slightly gray goes completely blurry gray when 
talking of interpreted code, let alone 'plugins'.

Some will say plugins should all be GPL, some say they can be whatever 
licensing they want.  At the end of the day, there is little to no legal 
precedence covering GPL, let alone plugins + GPL, let alone 
scripted-language + plugins + GPL.  Again, this was the exact tangent I was 
trying to avoid.  Let's just leave it as: there are multiple opinions, and 
I'm not sure any can be 'proven correct'. ;)

Regardless, the overall answer should be: yes, Plugins can have licensing. 
Whether it is GPL or otherwise may be a matter of debate, but that there IS 
licensing and that it HAS rules to follow should be undeniable.  The end 
result being: whatever the original license was, that copyright and 
attribution should remain in any work, assuming that was a term of the 
original license.

What'll really cook your noodle is when you imagine a plugin that calls some 
third piece of code.  The plugin obviously knows WP enough to call 
'add_action/add_filter' (note that another system could use those same 
function names, and same mechanisms, so that isn't necessarily WP-unique!), 
and has to know how to call into the 'third piece of code' (call is 'alien 
code').  But the alien code knows nothing of WP, nor the plugin.  Okay. 
NOW, is the plugin GPL?  The alien code is non-GPL, so the plugin can't 
possible 'pass on' GPL-ness to it by virtue of 'knowledge'.

Fun.  And gee, most of my plugins are structured just like the above 
example... ;)

I guess that's the point that I'm pretty sure of - I think removing the
copyright, or at least attribution, of plugins you're using violates the
license of those plugins in most cases. So, if this package comes with the
Google Sitemap Generator plugin which has been stripped of any identifying
info, then there's a problem. I checked it out quickly, and I see a
copyright, so that would have to stay on there. I don't know how to check
the Chameleon program without buying it, but I thought I'd drop that point
in here.

One other thought. WordPress's security team are doing a wonderful
job, but this Flip mob probably will be taking their time in patching
Chameleon with the patches for WordPress, so WP will probably remain
more secure?

Does anyone reckon it's ok with the GPL to purchase a copy of
Chameleon and apply some changes to the WordPress core? I mean, like
Matt going and shipping some Chameleon code with WP2.1 or something?

That would certainly be okay.  GPL is viral, so their WP-modification  
is GPL licensed, which means that just as they are licensed to take  
our modifications and apply them to their code, we can take their  
modifications and apply them to our code.  That is, assuming we can  
get out hands on the code.  As was said earlier in the thread, we  
don't have a right to the source code unless we buy the product (and,  
of course, PHP is only source code, so once you buy it, you have the  
source code.)  You could also try and convince one of their customers  
to give you the code, but you probably won't have much luck with  
that.  Contact them and ask about pricing.  If it is reasonably  
affordable, a few people could chip in and snag a copy for comparison  
purposes.  I'd keep your WP involvement a secret, though.  They'll  
probably balk if they know what you're about to do (not that I blame  
them, it'd hurt their bottom line).

WordPress Plugins are not covered under GPL, if they do not explicitly decide to cover it under GPL (or variants).

There was some discussion on this thread:
http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/a-gpl-license-question/
I have tried to collate all the information here.

What'll really cook your noodle is when you imagine a plugin that calls some 
third piece of code.  The plugin obviously knows WP enough to call 
'add_action/add_filter' (note that another system could use those same 
function names, and same mechanisms, so that isn't necessarily WP-unique!), 
and has to know how to call into the 'third piece of code' (call is 'alien 
code').  But the alien code knows nothing of WP, nor the plugin.  Okay. 
NOW, is the plugin GPL?  The alien code is non-GPL, so the plugin can't 
possible 'pass on' GPL-ness to it by virtue of 'knowledge'.

Fun.  And gee, most of my plugins are structured just like the above 
example... ;)

Many would argue that plugins are a derived work of WP and must use a 
GPL compatible license since we don't have an API exception spelled out. 
  Note that Creative Commons licenses are not GPL compatible and not 
usually recommended for source code licensing. There are many opinions 
on the matter though.  The safest thing is to GPL your plugins since WP 
itself is GPLed. This also gives you the best feel good karma since you 
are extending something on the same terms that it was given to you.  I 
personally don't bother with plugins that aren't GPL and won't integrate 
any of their code into WP so as to avoid license taint.  I don't get all 
hot and bothered about the licensing though. I'll leave that to others. 
  GPL compatibility of plugins/modules is always a great topic for 
heating up mailing lists.  :-)

Again, my original "NOW, is the plugin GPL?" question still stands, with "I 
don't know, but the 'alien code' certainly doesn't have to be"  as a decent 
response. And because of that, there's an immediate 'loophole'. ;)

Oh, and I'd be happy to GPL license stuff if you wanted to add it to the 
core.  Just drop me a line! :) :)  Otherwise, I'm happy with my 'free for 
non-commercial use, commercial contact me, but in any case I own the source' 
licensing...  ;)  Well, and my last few plugins were originally intended to 
be simple one-shot works made GPL or PD...

I certainly have no problem with my Karma.  Over two and a half year, I've 
'given back' more than I can count between my plugins, my free setup/config 
help, and my support-forums cruising.

Of course, if people clicked on my donate button(s) with any frequency, and 
wrote that they'd like to see stuff GPLed, I'd consider GPLing. ;) ;)

GPL covers the code and derivative works. The definition of derivative works (check copyright law) doesn't include plugins.

Hmm. Not so sure. Sec 2(b) suggests that plugins too, if distributed as part
of the product, would be under GPL:

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

Isn't wp-linkcategories a core table in the WP database? The backup wizard
shows it as being optional, off to the side. I don't think it's from one of
my plugins; I think it's from when the links functionality was redone, no?

Just saying the table should not be an optional backup..

linkcategories is a deprecated table.  Ryan was keeping it around  
(i.e. not deleting it altogether) as a contingency plan... so we  
could abort the whole "shared categories" thing if we wanted.

It was removed [1] from the list of "pre-checked" tables in the  
backup plugin intentionally.  In 2.1, it's just deadweight.

I want to add a second write post subpanel that is called "post experiment".
"post experiment" should use the same data flow for "write post".  I add the

I doubt it will be affordable, look at their customers, those are some of
the biggest profit makers in the Middle East.
However, the GPL licensce makes it clear that if you write to them and ask
them for the source they must make it available at no cost (they can go as
far as to print it and send it to you and charge you for the cost of
materials.. but that's extreme).

That would certainly be okay.  GPL is viral, so their WP-modification is GPL
licensed, which means that just as they are licensed to take our
modifications and apply them to their code, we can take their modifications
and apply them to our code.  That is, assuming we can get out hands on the
code.  As was said earlier in the thread, we don't have a right to the
source code unless we buy the product (and, of course, PHP is only source
code, so once you buy it, you have the source code.)  You could also try and
convince one of their customers to give you the code, but you probably won't
have much luck with that.  Contact them and ask about pricing.  If it is
reasonably affordable, a few people could chip in and snag a copy for
comparison purposes.  I'd keep your WP involvement a secret, though.
They'll probably balk if they know what you're about to do (not that I blame
them, it'd hurt their bottom line).

No it doesn't.  That was covered earlier in this thread.  See here  
for an unambiguous answer, right from the source:

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl- 
faq.html#DoesTheGPLRequireAvailabilityToPublic

Since this is PHP we're talking about... all code is source code.   
Thus, anyone who buys their product gets the source code.  That  
person can do whatever he likes with it, but neither Flip Media nor  
their customers are required to give the source code to anyone.  The  
GPL only states that they *may* distribute it, or modified versions.

Oh.
Right. 
That's a lot. I think if there is anything illegal in that we definitely should find out. 
AFAIK you have two options: Make a big deal out of it and get users to donate, or find some other way of getting your hands on the source. That's insane. 7k USD!!!!

derivative work is defined in copyright act. You can check it for yourself. By any stretch of definition plugins do not come under it.

I disagree :) Plugins are plugin author's work. He may or may not feel the same generosity as the software author himself. It is karma as is any work but by no stretch of definition bad karma.

Many would argue that plugins are a derived work of WP and must use a 
GPL compatible license since we don't have an API exception spelled out. 
  Note that Creative Commons licenses are not GPL compatible and not 
usually recommended for source code licensing. There are many opinions 
on the matter though.  The safest thing is to GPL your plugins since WP 
itself is GPLed. This also gives you the best feel good karma since you 
are extending something on the same terms that it was given to you.  I 
personally don't bother with plugins that aren't GPL and won't integrate 
any of their code into WP so as to avoid license taint.  I don't get all 
hot and bothered about the licensing though. I'll leave that to others. 
  GPL compatibility of plugins/modules is always a great topic for 
heating up mailing lists.  :-)

Subject: [wp-hackers] What do the key's mean on wp_attachment_metadata
Message-ID: <4486C892.8080603@phunky.co.uk>

Hi there,

Im currently trying to rack my brain around the way that a post's 
attached files work, ive figured out what data needs to be pulled from 
the database but im stuck on understanding what some of the values in 
wp_attachment_metadata mean.

Below is a link to the wp_attachment_metadata for 3 images uploaded to a 
post

http://wilcoding.xs4all.nl/Wilco/Pastecode/2992/showpaste.aspx

As you can see almost all the key's are the same before the values, 
apart from two of them  s:22 changes to s:23 and s:89 to s:87

Why is this? and what do each of these represent?

Im just trying to understand them a bit more before i go off and do some 
regex's to pull out the data i need.

Many thanks

Hi Mark,

That value is a serialized (string-version) of an array.  Those numbers 
are the number of bytes (characters) for the following value.  To pull 
the data out, just unserialize the value as an array.  If you follow me?

You can see what I mean in the get_post_meta function.  It calls another 
function called "maybe_unserialize".  If you use get_post_meta to 
retrieve the data, it'll unserialize the array for you.  :-)

Hi Ryan,

Thank you very much! quick google of "unserialize the value as an array" 
and im all sorted and understanding :)

Im self taught PHP Dev, so i tend to learn most things when i hit that 
development brick wall :D (dont we all?)

Thank you very much!

I'd normally ask this through the support forum, but this seems a little
advanced for many of the readers there.  

I think you all would be the ones to answer this, even if I posted it there.
Besides, perhaps there is something /deep/ in the WP code that is
specifically blocking this action... Though I don't see how it would even
get into WP's realm of influence (this should be all Apache), /something/ is
happening.  I've provided screen shots as proof of my statements.

My problem centers around a file in my themes directory:
WPPATH/wp-content/themes/WP-Binary-Blue-v110/single_comments.php
I've gotten some 249 404s for that file this month.  I have an additional 14
for single_content.php which is called by the MORE function... I've removed
most of my MORE references.  That's why that count is so low...

The file clearly exists: 
http://www.thecodecave.com/images/404/dirstruct.PNG

but when I connect to it from the browser, I get a 404...
http://www.thecodecave.com/wp-content/themes/WP-Binary-Blue-v110/single_comm
ents.php
http://www.thecodecave.com/images/404/browser.PNG

I have one .htaccess file in that entire directory branch.  It is located in
my root WP directory and currently contains:

IndexIgnore .htaccess */.??* *~ *# */HEADER* */README* */_vti*

# Showing off
Redirect /csrf.txt http://www.thecodecave.com/?p=105

# A couple redirects I want to keep from when I've tried different permalink
formats
Redirect
/2006/05/26/copy-as-text-link-and-copy-as-image-link-blogging-tools/
http://www.thecodecave.com/?p=152
Redirect /Article68 http://www.thecodecave.com/article68
Redirect /2006/05/28/lg-vx5200-lg-vx6000-lg-vx7000-lg-vx8100-stuff/
http://www.thecodecave.com/article113

# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress


The behavior is identical, whether .htaccess contains the above, or if I
blank it out and have nothing in .htaccess.

The rights on the directory structure and the file itself are 755:
http://www.thecodecave.com/images/404/dirrights.PNG
http://www.thecodecave.com/images/404/filerights.PNG

I have all of my capitalization correct...

WHAT AM I MISSING?????

Please tell me it is something simple so I can smack myself on the head and
put this to rest!

The .htaccess is a red herring.

single_comments.php loads wp-blog-header.php, which in turn attempts
to find content matching the request parameters. It fails and returns
a 404. A WordPress 404 page isn't returned because WP_USE_THEMES isn't
defined.

Compare:

  http://www.thecodecave.com/ ... /single_comments.php?p=152

HTH. :)

You neglected to mention where that script it linked, or what it is  
supposed to do.  Would also help to see the source of the file.  It  
is returning a 404 error, but it is loading.

Nicely done.  The solution may be to load wp-config.php instead... if  
you only need WordPress' functions and data structure, and not an  
automatic posts query attempt.

Processing....

Soooo, my 249 related 404s are ones that, for some odd reason, don't have a
parameter specified? or have an invalid parameter specified?  

Perhaps the theme can't handle my customized permalink structure? Hmmm...  

If that's the problem, I won't change my perma link structure again; so I'll
have to fix the code...  

Processing....(thanks!)

(BTW: I chose to use the /article<postid> structure because having a
non-default permalink structure allows AWStats to track the hits to the
individual posts, and yet the SEO advantages of including the post name in
the link is probably outweighed by the fact that no one can easily copy and
paste your links in emails or posts - especially if you link long post
titles and I do. /article<postid> seemed to be a good compromise.)

The .htaccess is a red herring.

single_comments.php loads wp-blog-header.php, which in turn attempts
to find content matching the request parameters. It fails and returns
a 404. A WordPress 404 page isn't returned because WP_USE_THEMES isn't
defined.

Compare:

  http://www.thecodecave.com/ ... /single_comments.php?p=152

HTH. :)

They do work.  Go ahead and try them out.

The slashes appear whenever you go through a POST type Are You Sure  
dialog (as opposed to a GET type).  In an unpatched and unplugged WP  
2.0.3 (tag 2.0.3 or revision #3825), edit a comment with single  
quote, a double quote and a slash in it somewhere.

Are you running 2.0.3?  I believe some recent change in *trunk's*  
TinyMCE turns quotes into entities before POSTing (so quotes would  
not get escaped, only slashes would).  This is one reason the bug was  
not discovered pre-release; people believed that testing on trunk was  
good enough.

Yes, I did just find that today and I agree it's very annoying.  I must have
misread the original post, I was under the impression that the extra slashes
were appearing in the URL you were redirected to, not in the original post.
But now I have a comment on my blog with sets of six slashes in it because I
edited another part of it several times...  I can see why the tune-up
plug-in would be required!

Like I said, many argue differently. This is a much debated point.  A 
debate over this spawned the effort in the linux kernel to do the driver 
license taint checking.  Your kernel is listed as tainted if the 
declared license of any driver is not GPL-compatible, IIRC, and many 
linux devs refuse to assist with problems involving tainted kernels.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Javascript Caching
Message-ID: <BB918777-5D98-41AC-900B-0D8739124E49@turbonet.com>

It seems that WordPress' PHP based javascript (list-manipulation- 
js.php, cat-js.php, etc.) do not get cached by my browser [1].  I  
have confirmed this by tailing my server's logs and by watching the  
transactions with LiveHTTPHeaders [2].

Does anyone else see similar behavior?

Perhaps we should add to these files something like the following.

header('Cache-control: max-age=2600000, must-revalidate', true);  //  
~1 month
header('ETag: ' . $_GET['ver'], true);

My knowledge of HTTP headers and browser/proxy caching is poor, however.

Michael,

I've witnessed this behavior also.  Under Firefox, you can check the 
Expires date of your cache by typing this into your browser window:  
"about: cache".  This is what I see for list-manipulation.js.php:

* Last modified:* 2006-06-07 15:42:24
*       Expires:* 1969-12-31 19:00:00

Cache-Control and Expires headers should be added to that file to enable browser caching properly.

I tried but it does not work :-(
I can show only: mysite.com/blog/library/
but not: mysite.com/blog/library/11/

I tried also installing your Now Reading plugin and I've the same problem.
Perhaps it depends on Windows (also if the server is Apache),
perhaps not mumble mumble....

Hah!  if so, that's both funny and scary.  That's assuming the password was 
truly non-trivial (i.e., wasn't something something could make some educated 
hacker guesses at for 5 minutes and happen upon it -- non-related words,

It was a pretty lame password, sorry. Sometimes I just get lazy. From 
what I can tell there were no WP exploits used, it was just the login form.

I had a moment of panic there.  What if the Dashboard didn't protect  
against HTML injection?  Someone could compromise every WP install in  
the world!  But it's okay, this is airtight:  :-)

It is important to set a good example. *smile* If they could hack Matt, they
could hack anyone, which was unnerving for a few hours...

FeedDemon 2.0.0.24 has this new feature:
Added: Items with a comment feed show a "Subscribe to this item's
comments" icon in Surfer style
It checks the feed for wfw:commentRss
I'm using svn code and I see no feed icon because my wp-rss2.php file
has wfw:commentRSS in it. If I edit that feed to wfw:commentRss then all
is well with FD. Looking around other WP blogs I see no icon for the
comments feed.

Maybe it needs editing? I would love to have this FD feature but I can
only edit my site :)

This is probably somewhat related to the recent /change/ to the RSS spec
to /correct/ the wfw:commentRSS that was in the spec people implemented to
the wfw:commentRss that was what the original author meant.

I'm sure it is, and the 'Content Encoded / CDATA' thing could be rolled
into this thread. Seeing as a new version is not so far away, and seeing
as we are talking two letters, no coding, no filename changes then is it
worth doing? I posted here because other readers may offer this now / in
the future and as such why not discuss it.

And as a sidenote, Bon Echo (the Firefox 2 dev) handles feeds very
gracefully. Displays them well and also has no problem with 'feed:'

I can see this is going to be a problem. The RSS validation standards
change, but till now it was just a badge, nothing else. But when people like
Nick Bradbury start to require it for their popular programs, something's
gotta give.

I'm also not a fan of the current validator, but I think we need to contact
them and set some ground rules - after all, WP accounts for a large
percentage of online feeds, in one way or another. WP is an excellent
example of standards compliance, but not when standards keep changing.. we
can't possibly release another version every time they get it in their heads
to change a letter or reword something in the standards, but it's obviously
of the utmost importance that _a_ standard *is* decided on, the only
question is what.

I know this was a hot debate a while back, and it wasn't too pretty either,
but then it was a fight over something of no implications either way... but
now the implications are definitely real, and this needs to be decided.

Lol... you should see IE7 Beta 2 and the way _it_ handles RSS, it puts even
Minefield's handling to shame, it's just so beautiful!

Anyway, I don't think the issue here is just the two letters, 70 ASCII keys
apart, it's the reason behind them.
This time it's two letters, but next time how do you know they won't require
a different MIME type or an extra file? There was _no reason_ to change the
standards from commentRss to commentRSS, just pure whimsical wishy-washy
feelings - sure, it doesn't look right, but they should have thought of that
from the beginning.. it's kinda obvious if you get what I'm saying.

Don't you realize you're like an Internet pop star?  You've got a Big target

In fact, I bet they'll move on through some of the other celebs like Dougal,

Watch out folks!  I trust we all have secure passwords and don't use those

Psst.  Wrong way there buddy. (RSS -> Rss)

I've been using FeedValidator as a standard for a while now.  And I'm
quite bothered that Wordpress cannot commit a two character fix.  I
believe there's been two releases now that have missed the boat.

What was the reason it changed to Rss in the first place?  I don't
know, but this is well formed web's namespace, and we're subject to
their rules/decisions.  If Wordpress is going to support and use wfw,
then it better continue to.

If Wordpress chooses not to, make YOUR OWN namespace and put in the
features YOU want.  But don't drone on around an outdated spec.

Is FeedValidator ***the*** 'standard'?  Heck no, they're a
recommendation, just as much as w3 specifications are.
You see that point?  We follow the w3 specs carefully, because they're
debated, chosen for a reason, and put a LOT of effort behind it.
FeedValidator has an open mailing list, anyone can go in there and
talk about it.  I don't believe I've ever seen Matt do this.  Just
complain about it, and Sam's "political weight" behind FV.

I don't mean this to come off as inflammatory, but I'm really bothered
at the decision here and Matt's previously referenced post.
The FeedValidator is a good point of ensuring things are designed the
way they're meant to be designed (based off the RSS specs).  Just like
w3.
Not to mention:
1) Sam changed "avoid content:encoded" to a warning, not an error.
2) You should consider reading the reason for this warning in the
first place, it's really quite enlightening on the subject.

Hi Guys,

I am new to Wordpress. I am not sure if this is the right place. I
have created my first plugin. This plugin displays a suggested
spelling correction for a given search query. The user can simply
click on the suggestion run the suggested query. Using this plugin
anyone can provide spelling suggestions for common mistakes.

Help me find some bugs in it. The main concern I have is with respect
to XSS/CSS attacks.
The URL to the plugin is:

Did FeedDemon used to support the wfw:commentRSS spelling?  I really  
hope they didn't change it to the new spelling and then cease  
supporting the old version.  Feed consumers need to expect either.

Yeah, it's frustrating that the Feed Validator is now reporting as  
invalid feeds that haven't changed... but WordPress shouldn't be the  
ground on which a battle is waged.  We're obviously not going to  
release a new version just to change this, but if we're releasing  
anyway (which we have been, and which we are going to do, to fix some  
of the 2.0.3 issues), why *NOT* put the change in?  Like it or not,  
the Feed Validator is the bar by which feeds are measured.   
wfw:commentRss was the original spelling, as it existed in the spec  
that the author wrote.  Their position, legalistic and ivory-towered  
as it may be, is still correct.

Exactly. It's not high priority, but surely committing it now so it's 
there for 2.0.4 won't harm anyone?

You see though, I have no problem with that. What I have a problem with (as
I stated earlier) is that it shouldn't _just change_ for no reason. Sure,
it's just two letters now, but what if the <title> tag is changed to
<post_title>!? It's an extreme example, but the point is, we need to find a
solution that doesn't involve a new release every time.

Did FeedDemon used to support the wfw:commentRSS spelling?  I really hope
they didn't change it to the new spelling and then cease supporting the old
version.  Feed consumers need to expect either.

Yeah, it's frustrating that the Feed Validator is now reporting as invalid
feeds that haven't changed... but WordPress shouldn't be the ground on which
a battle is waged.  We're obviously not going to release a new version just
to change this, but if we're releasing anyway (which we have been, and which
we are going to do, to fix some of the 2.0.3 issues), why *NOT* put the
change in?  Like it or not,  
the Feed Validator is the bar by which feeds are measured.   
wfw:commentRss was the original spelling, as it existed in the spec that the
author wrote.  Their position, legalistic and ivory-towered as it may be, is
still correct.

I stand corrected.
I was under the impression that wfw:commentRSS _used to be_ correct... but I
just realized that it was always wrong, but the Feed Validator didn't give a
damn.. and when it did and started giving penalties for not using commentRss
the trouble started.

In light of this.. I understand that this would be a one-time change, etc...
and that WP was wrong...

(I hate being wrong, it's so hard to apologize after stirring up trouble!!

Message-ID: <448948C3.6020508@phunky.co.uk>

Hey guys,

wondering if any of you are able to help me out here, im almost done 
with my new project for my Counter-Strike:Source Clans new website

http://beta.mem-gaming.co.uk - all WordPress powered of course :)

Im having a little trouble with in_category() it does not seem to like 
to check for children cats. Is there any other built in function in 
wordpress for checking if a post is IN or a CHILD of a certain cat?

If theres not ill have to write one, just cant seem to find anything to 
suggest there is one already.

Many thanks

More rock-solid specifications than WFW's Comment RSS have been 
maintained with typos.  "HTTP_REFERER".  QED.

Hmm... And yet the day your hack occurred, traffic to our Hilton Files blog
doubled. Coincidence? I think not.

Message-ID: <70055a110606091020r34ce8d64n9e43c5282ceedb5f@mail.gmail.com>

I'm new to wp plugin development, and would appreciate your help for
implementing a new "write specific post" feature.  I looked at
StructuredBlogging plugin for wordpress, which has similar features. It's a
great plugin, but the implementation requires massive rewriting wordpress
functions.  I hope to have a much simpler approach that only uses existing
pluging API. Here is my apporach:

function w2x_add_pages() {
    add_submenu_page('post-new.php', 'Write Experment Post', 'Experiment
Post', 8, 'post-exp', 'w2x_show_exp_post');
}
function w2x_show_exp_post() {
    //should set a variable here to indicate a special post type.  what
global variable to use?
    wp_redirect("http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/post-new.php");
}
add_action('admin_menu', 'w2x_add_pages');

function w2x_prefill_post($post_content) {
    // How to find out what type of post it is?  If it's special post,
modify the default content.
    return $post_content;
}
add_filter('default_content', 'w2x_prefill_post');

I'm having problem in finding out the type of post inside the filter
function. Is there a global variable to set before redirecting the page?
This variable will be used in the filter function to do approriate
filtering.

Is there a better approach than wp_redirect?  I basically want to use the
same post-new.php and pre-fill the write area with some text. Appreciate any
advice.

Thanks,
AJ

I actually started writing that code a few days ago, and was going to  
share with this list, but it slipped my mind.

The way it works is by checking each category that the post is in and  
"digging up" recursively from each one, checking the parents until it  
finds a match (or gets to the top of all category trees without  
finding a match).

This might be a good candidate for inclusion into core... it's  
certainly useful.  No longer do you have to check the parent cat and  
the child cat... you can just check the child cat and then use this  
function in your template logic.

I just picked up the dead-tree version of this, pretty cool to see WP in 
a magazine I used to read as a little kid, but I agree the ordering 
confused me in places.

We're in some pretty good company though, and hopefully if we keep 
trucking along next year we'll be higher. :)

Very sorry about this. Textdrive still hasn't fixed this problem so I'm 
looking at moving all SVN elsewhere. I'll look at this again and try to 
nail down a timeline for the transition.

Great thread, let me try to summarize some of my thoughts, from 36,000 feet:

I can't speak for everyone, but all of my work on WP from the beginning 
has been with the knowledge that someone would rip/sell/steal/etc any 
and all of it. Just like giving people freedom to say whatever they want 
means that they might say things that you disagree with, in the end I 
think the inherent freedom is more important than control. In my 
experience I've found the good far outweighs the bad. I've applied the 
principles of "give as much away as possible" to other parts of my life 
and it has been nothing but rewarding.


Even *if* there were some sort of awful license violation, in 99.9% of 
cases it's not worth pursuing. The time and cost of a legal battle (in 
another country, to top it off) would be energy far better spent on 
bugs, support, features, etc. Besides, if the features are that great 
it'd be better just to clean-room implement them as GPL rather than 
extracting them forcibly from someone who doesn't want to share. (Not to 
mention it would probably be 3-5x faster.)

I think supporting a platform you're building on is a no-brainer 
business decision though, natural selection will do far more than legal 
action in the long-run for these types of cases.


I have always recommended people doing development around WordPress 
license their work as GPL, as I think that provides the most long-term 
benefit for both the individual and the community. (It's a virtuous 
cycle.) We've socially encouraged that with GPL requirements on 
wp-plugins and in the theme competitions, and I think the flourishing of 
those areas is a testament to the power of the GPL and open source. 
(Thousands of examples are available outside of the WP ecosystem, too.)


When I see or hear about people who want to work for themselves or make 
a living off of WordPress-related things but having trouble the problem 
has never been with the license. If you want a Real Job with a Big 
Company, don't you think organizations like New York Times and CNET that 
are putting huge investments into using WordPress aren't crazy for 
people who know the system really well? Watch Craigslist, Monster, etc 
for listing with "WordPress" in them, they're popping up pretty commonly 
now.

For people just looking for some extra beer/server money from their 
work, the biggest mistake I see is simply not asking. Make it *really 
easy* for people to find your Paypal or Amazon wishlist. I won't say how 
many times I've tried to buy a book or something as a thank you for 
people on this list and couldn't for love or money find something on 
their site that enabled me to. (As an aside, if you're overseas try to 
have a donation mechanism that's easy for US folks too.) Have a mailing 
list for release announcements. If you'd work on something more if you 
got more money, then tell people. Provide amazing free support and put a 
"if you found this useful" link at the end of every email. If you're 
open to people sponsoring features, or paid customizations, make that 
obvious. Also consider publishing how much you get in donations, as most 
people VASTLY overestimate donations, or they assume someone else is 
doing it so they don't need to. Outright charging is usually not the 
most successful model.

Finally, I think striking out on your own can be incredibly rewarding 
and is a great lifestyle and challenge, though I know it's not for 
everybody. Biggest mistake I see in this group is forgetting it's a 
business, just like anything else. Buy or check out as many books about 
small businesses, finances, entrepreneurship, etc as you can. At the 
same time, don't forget to budget time for community. Before I started 
left CNET and started Automattic I knew about a dozen people doing 
full-time WP consulting and work, names you mostly don't know because 
they were so caught up in their own work they weren't improving the core 
platform they were building their livelihood on. I swore I wouldn't let 
that happen, and luckily have found a model that allows 95+ percent of 
work to be completely Open, but it's something you have to plan ahead of 
time because it's very easy to get caught up. There are business models 
around consulting, support, services, training, development, 
advertising, and dozens of other things that can include and encourage 
supporting Open Source.  I will happily phone chat for 30 minutes with 
anyone in the WP community who is fleshing out a sustainable business 
idea to strike it out on your own. I'm happy to share what I've found 
worked and what didn't. If you need help, just ask!

Hey, no big deal.. theres a way around it. I just wanted to make you 
aware that there was something funny going on with it. Whenever you get 
around to it is cool. Just let us know if/when its moved so we can go 
back to checking out the whole shebang again. Thanks Matt!

I can speak to the success of these tips from experience.  When I  
first put up a "Donate" button at the bottom of all my plugin pages  
[1], I got about $5 in 6 months.  Then, I was on someone else's site  
and I saw that they were posting how much money in donations they'd  
received that month.  The mindset is "well, this is popular code, so  
people MUST be donating."  And then you see the little line that says  
that they've received $5.00 and you feel a lot more inclined to hit  
that donate button!  Once I started posting how much money I'd  
received, donations went up considerably.  It's still not going to  
pay for my server, but it helps.  More than anything, it acts as  
encouragement.  I'd be doing it anyway, but sometimes you just need a  
(monetary) pat on the back.

If you make your living from WordPress-related services, you're  
really be stupid not to contribute back to the community.  If you're  
finding ways in which the software can be improved, and you're NOT  
sharing them, you're going to waste so much more time maintaining  
your separate fork that you won't have time to respond to the  
specific needs of your clients.  Besides, if you do work with  
WordPress, part of your job is convincing people that WordPress is  
the right tool for them.  If they read a review criticizing  
WordPress' poor handling of X, it might not help that you have a WP  
fork that addresses X... you've already lost the sale.

How come there wasn't much fanfare about this? I've been playing with it 
tonight and it's pretty damn useful - yet it doesn't seem to have been 
mentioned on this list at all. It just seems strange, since it would 
benefit a lot of plugin authors and developers alike.

Since it seems to have slipped under the radar, I wrote a quick 
introduction to the class and how it can help plugin authors[1]. HTH.

For reference, you can view the class itself here[1] (scroll down), the 
Trac ticket that added it here[2].

Current hooks allow plugin to add new fields below the write textarea.  My
plugin changes "write post" to write a specific post, and thus needs to
label it accordingly.  Is there is way (hook) to add a lable near "Write

Message-ID: <200606120117.k5C1HBkL010694@post.webmailer.de>

Hi,

 

I'm having trouble with my favourite topic again: rewrite rules.

 

This is what my htaccess looks like:

# BEGIN WordPress

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

RewriteEngine On

RewriteBase /digitalcamera/

RewriteRule ^camera-selector/([0-9]*)$
wp-content/plugins/interface/interface.php?nm=$1

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

RewriteRule . /digitalcamera/index.php

</IfModule>

# END WordPress

 

 

The line RewriteRule ^camera-selector/([0-9]*)$
wp-content/plugins/interface/interface.php? nm=$1 is supposed to take any
number behind camera-selector (which is a page I created in Wordpress that
uses a custom plugin) and load the interface.php plugin file with the nm
variable attached. 

The problem is that as soon as I go to the page
http://www.mysite.com/digitalcamera/camera-selector I only get a blank
window with no code in it.

 

Any ideas? Is it clashing with any of the following rules?

 

Thanks guys.

 

Stefan

Subject: [wp-hackers] TinyMCE issues
Message-ID: <448D2033.8080002@viper007bond.com>

So, I'm writing a plugin to make buttons to insert YouTube and Google 
Video videos into your posts. I'm doing it via ButtonSnap and it works 
fine for the non-WYSIWYG editor.

Here's an example generated code snippet:

<object style="width: 425px; height: 350px" 
type="application/x-shockwave-flash" 
data="http://www.youtube.com/v/hl2UUunlI2Q"><param name="movie" 
value="http://www.youtube.com/v/hl2UUunlI2Q" /><param name="wmode" 
value="transparent" /></object>

The problem is that when I put that into TinyMCE, it totally screws it 
up by adding line breaks:

<object style="width: 425px; height: 350px" 
type="application/x-shockwave-flash" 
data="http://www.youtube.com/v/hl2UUunlI2Q">
<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/hl2UUunlI2Q" />
<param name="wmode" value="transparent" /></object>

Before I resort to using a placeholder (like 
[youtube]hl2UUunlI2Q[/youtube]) at least for TinyMCE, is there way I can 
stop it from doing that? I just wanted to make this plugin a button 
generator rather than a dynamic replacer. :/

Did you finish reading the entry? Not fixed... disabled by default. The 
problem could potentially exist if the user data cache is enabled again.

"Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary 
commands by sending a specially crafted username. As of Wordpress 2.0.2 
the user data cache is disabled as the default."

No. It is fixed in 2.0.3.  The cache was disabled by default in 2.0.2.

The following change removed any chance for this exploit or any similar
one working against the cache: http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3797

You're right on that, but the solution is not to  give up on this method
(and even if what you are saying is correct that interface.php does not
exist, this may be helpful). Look into the rewrite rule flags.  Those are
the things that you see in brackets [] at the end of the rewrite rule lines
- but you don't have any.

See here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html

You probably just need to put a [L] at the end of your first rewrite rule.
That will tell it to stop processing there.  What you have right now, since
the camera-selector rule is first is functionally equivalent to a [N].
 

 

The line RewriteRule ^camera-selector/([0-9]*)$
wp-content/plugins/interface/interface.php? nm=$1 is supposed to take any
number behind camera-selector (which is a page I created in Wordpress that
uses a custom plugin) and load the interface.php plugin file with the nm
variable attached. 

The problem is that as soon as I go to the page
http://www.mysite.com/digitalcamera/camera-selector I only get a blank
window with no code in it.

 

Any ideas? Is it clashing with any of the following rules?

 

Thanks guys.

Be  very  careful  with these. Both YouTube and Google  Video  will  begin
crashing  Web  browsers  after  a while (been a victim  of  both),  having
'HotLinked'  for  a while, despite fair use. In the case of Google,  there
will  be  a  PageRank  depletion  (or a drop to 0),  as  well  as  ranking
penalties,  backlinks depletion and unhappy visitors whose browsers  crash
(even Konqueror) until the offensive code is removed. Some people seem to'
survive' the embedment of such videos, but I don't know how...

Oh! and ma will very be disappoint to see theat the object markup does not
validate! *smile* It is rarely (if ever) W3C standards-compliant.

I don't have a decent suggestion because I don't know TinyMCE's internals.
However,  if  your  use  a  JavaScript pop-up  to  prompt  for  URL  (e.g.
http://www.youtube.com/v/hl2UUunlI2Q  ),  try to wrap it with classes  and
put some of the remainder [style] attribute in an auxiliary stylesheet. It
might help in preventing the nasty newlines...?

I'd love to see proof of any of that considering we run videos from both on
more than 30 blogs and haven't seen any of these negative impacts.

I'm not saying it *doesn't* happen, just that it seems odd, and I haven't
yet seen it :)

Message-ID: <001a01c68e4c$b69318f0$23b94ad0$@net>

Hey Guys, 

I just tried to use my search function, and got some rather weird results.

 

http://neosmart.net/blog/

In the search box, I typed "Bon Echo" and hit enter.
(http://neosmart.net/blog/index.php?s=Bon+Echo) 

 

I get back a error 406, Not Acceptable

 

"Not Acceptable

An appropriate representation of the requested resource /blog/index.php
could not be found on this server.

 

Apache/1.3.34 Server at www.neosmart.net Port 80"

 

However, if I search for anything else (even other multi-word phrases) it
works. Example, search for "digital audio"
(http://neosmart.net/blog/index.php?s=digital+audio) 

 

If I search for something that doesn't exist, e.g. aoeuaoou
(http://neosmart.net/blog/index.php?s=oaeuaou) I get the appropriate error
page

 

It just doesn't make much sense to me. Has anyone ever experienced this with
WP before? It doesn't seem to be a theme-related issue, and I don't see how
it could be my server config..

 

Regards,

The "echo" probably triggered an overzealous mod_security filter.

Hmm. I wonder why, since "select" and "unlink" work.. which are
theoretically much more dangerous, no?

Message-ID: <D0252C90757CBC4B8BC938A72BEDDF9DF98207@dsimail.drbsystems.com>

While checking out different permalink structures, my site was crawled by
several search engines.  And I am still getting traffic from those links.
I've been hard coding redirects into .htaccess for my most popular posts,
but it seems to me that I should not need to do this...

I decided it should be possible to get WordPress to process all of the built
in permalink structures (and one custom one that I tried), and here's what I
did to get this to work:

In classes.php, after this line:
		// Post
		$post_rewrite =
$this->generate_rewrite_rules($this->permalink_structure);
		$post_rewrite = apply_filters('post_rewrite_rules',
$post_rewrite);

I added these lines:
		$post_rewrite1 =
$this->generate_rewrite_rules('/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/');
		$post_rewrite1 = apply_filters('post_rewrite_rules',
$post_rewrite1);

		$post_rewrite2 =
$this->generate_rewrite_rules('/archives/%post_id%');
		$post_rewrite2 = apply_filters('post_rewrite_rules',
$post_rewrite2);

		$post_rewrite3 =
$this->generate_rewrite_rules('/Article%post_id%');
		$post_rewrite3 = apply_filters('post_rewrite_rules',
$post_rewrite3);

And then changed:
		$this->rules = array_merge($page_rewrite, $root_rewrite,
$comments_rewrite, $search_rewrite, $category_rewrite, $author_rewrite,
$date_rewrite, $post_rewrite);


To this:
		$this->rules = array_merge($page_rewrite, $root_rewrite,
$comments_rewrite, $search_rewrite, $category_rewrite, $author_rewrite,
$date_rewrite, $post_rewrite, $post_rewrite1, $post_rewrite2,
$post_rewrite3);

(BTW I do currently have a custom permalink structure. Which is what allows
it to get into this section of the code.  There is an if statement prior to
this that just drops you out of the section when you have a blank/default
permalink structure.)

Is there any reason why I should not do this?  I don't think the speed hit
will be that bad.  

Should something similar be a default WP option (a check box for processing
legacy/alternate/all default permalink structures)?

I KNOW I am not the only one that experimented with alternate permalink
structures for their blog... And many people probably ran them for more than
a day or two...

A reason not to use that specific code is that a plugin will be much
easier to maintain.

It's generally considered a bad idea to use more than one permalink
structure because it reduces pagerank. Search engines don't like
duplicated content. It may also be confusing for users. Serving 301
redirects is actually the correct approach, though there's no reason
why they couldn't be handled automagically by a WordPress plugin
instead of manually added to your .htaccess.

Message-ID: <cd3f14da0606131145r36b992c1rd4990c1b56ab3ae0@mail.gmail.com>

Fellow Wordpress-Hackers,
I asked this in the forums (http://wordpress.org/support/topic/75123),
but I didn't get an answer:
I am working on a plugin for the singapore-image-gallery (sgal.org).
What I would like to do is create permalinks that are calling a
certain page. Usually I create a page and singapore creates links like
this:
wordpress.com/index.php/foto/?gallery=test
The gallery is called test. The page title is "foto". Now I would like
it to look like this:
wordpress.com/index.php/gallery/test and point to the above URL.

Now I have a function like this:

	function singaporeRewriteRules($rules)
	{
		global $wp_rewrite;

		// add rewrite tokens
		$keytag_token = '%gallery%';
		//$rewrite->page_structure = $rewrite->page_structure."/".$keytag_token;
		$wp_rewrite->add_rewrite_tag($keytag_token, '(.+)',
'page_id='.get_option('singapore_page').'&gallery=');
		
		$keywords_structure = $wp_rewrite->root ."gallery/$keytag_token";
		$keywords_rewrite = $wp_rewrite->generate_rewrite_rule($keywords_structure);

		return ( $rules+$keywords_rewrite );
	}

	add_action('rewrite_rules_array',array($this,'singaporeRewriteRules'));

What it outputs in the rewrite-rule-Array is this:
[index.php/gallery/(.+)/?$] => index.php?page_id=67&gallery=$matches[1]

This obviously doesn't work. I also tried to create links like this:
* [index.php/fotos/gallery/(.+)/?$] => index.php?page_id=67&gallery=$matches[1]
* [index.php/(fotos)/gallery/(.+)/?$] =>
index.php?page_id=67&gallery=$matches[1]
* [index.php/fotos/gallery/?$] => index.php?gallery=$matches[1]

But it didn't work either, maybe someone could help me out, please?

Thank you very much,
Niels Hackius

Message-ID: <cd3f14da0606131154p4bd9e3f5ued293d90bd5e9acd@mail.gmail.com>

Fellow Wordpress-Hackers,
I asked this in the forums (http://wordpress.org/support/topic/75123),
but I didn't get an answer:
I am working on a plugin for the singapore-image-gallery (sgal.org).
What I would like to do is create permalinks that are calling a
certain page. Usually I create a page and singapore creates links like
this:
wordpress.com/index.php/foto/?gallery=test
The gallery is called test. The page title is "foto". Now I would like
it to look like this:
wordpress.com/index.php/gallery/test and point to the above URL.

Now I have a function like this:

        function singaporeRewriteRules($rules)
        {
                global $wp_rewrite;

                // add rewrite tokens
                $keytag_token = '%gallery%';
                //$rewrite->page_structure =
$rewrite->page_structure."/".$keytag_token;
                $wp_rewrite->add_rewrite_tag($keytag_token, '(.+)',
'page_id='.get_option('singapore_page').'&gallery=');

                $keywords_structure = $wp_rewrite->root
."gallery/$keytag_token";
                $keywords_rewrite =
$wp_rewrite->generate_rewrite_rule($keywords_structure);

                return ( $rules+$keywords_rewrite );
        }

        add_action('rewrite_rules_array',array($this,'singaporeRewriteRules'));

What it outputs in the rewrite-rule-Array is this:
[index.php/gallery/(.+)/?$] => index.php?page_id=67&gallery=$matches[1]

This obviously doesn't work. I also tried to create links like this:
* [index.php/fotos/gallery/(.+)/?$] => index.php?page_id=67&gallery=$matches[1]
* [index.php/(fotos)/gallery/(.+)/?$] =>
index.php?page_id=67&gallery=$matches[1]
* [index.php/fotos/gallery/?$] => index.php?gallery=$matches[1]

But it didn't work either, maybe someone could help me out, please?

Thank you very much,
Niels Hackius

I didn't think a plug-in was possible since I could not find a nearby hook,
but I just found template_redirect

http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API

template_redirect

No parameter. Executes before the determination of the template file to be
used to display the requested page. Useful for providing additional
templates based on request criteria. Example (pedagogical, not useful):
Redirect all requests to the all.php template file in the current themes'
directory. 

function all_on_one () {
	include(TEMPLATEPATH . '/all.php');
	exit;
}

add_action('template_redirect', 'all_on_one');


With that, as you suggest, I can redirect links in ALL of my old styles to a
301 page.  

Thanks for the push in that direction.

That looks like the right rule to me. Does WordPress know about the
"gallery" query var? Something like:

function singaporeAddQueryVar($vars) {
	$vars[] = 'gallery';
	return $vars;
}
add_filter('query_vars', 'singaporeAddQueryVar');

Sam, Brian, fellow Hackers,
thank you very much for the quick answers - I realize there has talk
about a problem similar to this: However I am more going in the
direction that besides passing on a variable I would like to go to a
specific page too:

I already have a template-redirection-Function that looks like this:

	function SingaporeGetTemplate($vars)
	{	
		if($this->SingaporeIsPage()){
			if (file_exists(TEMPLATEPATH .  '/singapore_page.php')) {
				include(TEMPLATEPATH.'/singapore_page.php');
				exit;
			}
			else {
				add_filter("the_content", array($this,"SingaporeTheContentInclude"));
			}
		}
	}

I also implemented Sams suggestions, but that doesn't make any
difference right now.

Is it even possible to have redirect target like this:
"index.php?page_id=67". Because on a normal page redirect the id isn't
shown. It looks more like this:

   [index.php/fotos/([^/]+)/?$] => index.php?attachment=$matches[1]
    [index.php/fotos/([^/]+)/trackback/?$] =>
index.php?attachment=$matches[1]&tb=1
    [index.php/fotos/([^/]+)/feed/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$] =>
index.php?attachment=$matches[1]&feed=$matches[2]
    [index.php/fotos/([^/]+)/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$] =>
index.php?attachment=$matches[1]&feed=$matches[2]
    [index.php/fotos/attachment/([^/]+)/?$] => index.php?attachment=$matches[1]
    [index.php/fotos/attachment/([^/]+)/trackback/?$] =>
index.php?attachment=$matches[1]&tb=1
    [index.php/fotos/attachment/([^/]+)/feed/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$]
=> index.php?attachment=$matches[1]&feed=$matches[2]
    [index.php/fotos/attachment/([^/]+)/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$]
=> index.php?attachment=$matches[1]&feed=$matches[2]

How does Wordpress know which page to flip open right there?

Thank you so much for helping out,
Niels Hackius

you may want to look at the podPress plugin and how I handle the stats
functionality.

It seems to match up closely with what you want to accomplish

Message-ID: <3FBB736F-87A1-4031-95D7-5A67990B5E4F@codehooligans.com>

Happy Tuesday all,

I posted this earlier for the WP Support but no answer.

A client wants to limit the number or items returned for a search  
result page to 5 items. I've looked through the classes.php code and  
see the use of 'posts_per_page'. I can see where the default value is  
set from the options. I don't want to change the site-wide result,  
just on this page.

So I've added a hidden form field of this name to my search form. Set  
the value to 5. When I search I still get the default of 10. I've  
tried to trace through the code and cannot determin what I'm doing  
wrong.

My WP is 2.0.2. Here is my form code:

<form method="get" id="searchform" action="<?php bloginfo('home'); ?>/">
<input type="text" class="textbox" name="s" id="s" value="<?php echo  
wp_specialchars($s, 1); ?>" />
<input type="hidden" class="textbox" name="posts_per_page"  
id="posts_per_page" value="5" />
<input type="image" alt="go" class="imgbutton" name="imageField"  
src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/gosearchbutton.jpg" />
</form>

Any thoughts? I really want to keep this clean if possible. Meaning I  
don't want to write a plugin just for this. Also I don't want to re- 
call get_posts from my search.php page. To me this would be double- 
processing the search.

Happy Wednesday where I am!

IIRC posts_per_page is a private query var and can't be set that way
-- presumably this is because it'd otherwise be too easy to DOS a site
with requests for 9999 posts.

A simple plugin to set posts_per_page to 5 if (is_search()) doesn't
seem like a bad solution to me. That and re-calling get_posts() are
the only solutions that spring to mind.

I know this is not in the spirit with which you made that statement, but
what if such a plugin were already written?

Are there any examples of using add_rewrite_endpoint anywhere. I couldn't find its usage in obvious endpoints like trackbacks etc.
Can anyone please provide me with a simple example or point me to one.

Thanks,

There is a plugin that does just that already. It changes any non-selected
wp-permalinks to 301 redirects to the real deal.
Try this link: http://neosmart.net/blog/?p=182
It'll redirect you to: http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/182 with a 301
header.

This is the plugin: http://fucoder.com/code/permalink-redirect/

Subject: [wp-hackers] Hack to prevent 404s

While checking out different permalink structures, my site was crawled by
several search engines.  And I am still getting traffic from those links.
I've been hard coding redirects into .htaccess for my most popular posts,
but it seems to me that I should not need to do this...

I decided it should be possible to get WordPress to process all of the built
in permalink structures (and one custom one that I tried), and here's what I
did to get this to work:

In classes.php, after this line:
		// Post
		$post_rewrite =
$this->generate_rewrite_rules($this->permalink_structure);
		$post_rewrite = apply_filters('post_rewrite_rules',
$post_rewrite);

I added these lines:
		$post_rewrite1 =
$this->generate_rewrite_rules('/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/');
		$post_rewrite1 = apply_filters('post_rewrite_rules',
$post_rewrite1);

		$post_rewrite2 =
$this->generate_rewrite_rules('/archives/%post_id%');
		$post_rewrite2 = apply_filters('post_rewrite_rules',
$post_rewrite2);

		$post_rewrite3 =
$this->generate_rewrite_rules('/Article%post_id%');
		$post_rewrite3 = apply_filters('post_rewrite_rules',
$post_rewrite3);

And then changed:
		$this->rules = array_merge($page_rewrite, $root_rewrite,
$comments_rewrite, $search_rewrite, $category_rewrite, $author_rewrite,
$date_rewrite, $post_rewrite);


To this:
		$this->rules = array_merge($page_rewrite, $root_rewrite,
$comments_rewrite, $search_rewrite, $category_rewrite, $author_rewrite,
$date_rewrite, $post_rewrite, $post_rewrite1, $post_rewrite2,
$post_rewrite3);

(BTW I do currently have a custom permalink structure. Which is what allows
it to get into this section of the code.  There is an if statement prior to
this that just drops you out of the section when you have a blank/default
permalink structure.)

Is there any reason why I should not do this?  I don't think the speed hit
will be that bad.  

Should something similar be a default WP option (a check box for processing
legacy/alternate/all default permalink structures)?

I KNOW I am not the only one that experimented with alternate permalink
structures for their blog... And many people probably ran them for more than
a day or two...

Yes, thanks Guru. I saw that, downloaded it, and sent him an email about
the typo on his download page. But that plugin does something, well not
quite opposite of what I want, but different.  

It takes the links that are already near the approved permalink
structure and forces them to exactly match it.  As the plugin
description itself says:
"This plugin ensures that pages and entries are always accessed via the
permalink"

That's not what I'm gunnin' for.  My plugin is more:
"This plugin allows WP to accept old permalinks and redirect them to the
current permalink structure."

I'll have to call mine something completely different though to make
sure there is a distintion.  I'm thinking 'No More 404!'.  I can even
edit one of those sign carrying smilies and make a nice icon for it...

Call me thick, but I'm not sure I understand the difference... Unless:
Does yours keep a record of old permalinks used and then use 301-redirect
them to the latest?
Will it also " that are already near the approved permalink structure and
forces them to exactly match it?"
If so, me wants it! ;-)

Message-ID: <468BFC273F94FA4BB82748D4BC9BC3401023F6@CLWILL-SERVER.CLWill.local>

I would approach WP support with this, but from the recent discussions
here about rewrites/redirects, and this issue's complexities with the
post and preview logic, I was hoping for help here.

For years I had a site with index.html as its front page.  Google hit it
just fine and indexed it.

Now I'm a dyed-in-the-wool WP'er and love it.  But that makes index.php
my front page.  Google still has index.html, which now gets a 404.  So I
thought I'd use .htaccess to do a permanent redirect, give Google their
301 and life would be good.  I added this line to my .htaccess:

	RedirectMatch permanent (.*)index\.html$ $1index.php

Worked great, references to index.html go to my main page, all is
wonderful in Google-land (they even crawled and saw the change).  The
rest of the site is working fine too.  I thought everything was
hunky-dory.

Except in post's page preview.  It always shows my home page, not the
post being edited.  If I comment out this line from .htaccess, I see the
post, but then of course people going to the old .html get hosed.

Suggestions?  Comments?  Help?

Thanks in advance,
Chris

Yep, you've got it.  

I'll have a config screen that has check boxes for which of the default
permalink structures to rewrite and it will provide a field to enter any
number of non-default permalink structures, 1 per line.

That way it can provide the rewrite rules only for the structures you've
tried and not waste any extra server power.  

I'll post the plug in hopefully later today - 

That is if the monitor and walls decide they will quit spinning...

We need to know a little more about your configuration since you aren't
doing the defaults and the way .htaccess works will be affected by how
Is how do you have your permalink and .htaccess setup now, following the
layout you desire?  
IOW. are you deliberately putting the index.php in the middle?

Can you provide some example full urls with the two ways your visitors
should access a specific post and what you have as your permalink
structure?

Message-ID: <001201c68fdf$3fdb3f50$0300a8c0@greenville>

 Personally, although I know the widgets/ajax is easier, I've been more
inclined to hand code things myself for clients rather than rely on
something like the widgets plugin. In addition, unless absolutely necessary,
as time goes on I purposely avoid using  javascript as much as possible, and
when I do use it I like to simplify things as much as possible and make sure
that it is compatible with (or at least doesn't cause a user identifiable
issue with) the major browsers. That being said, AJAX has tremendous
potential as a tool, developers of any JavaScript code need to be mindful of
standards compliance which I know isn't always easy or possible when trying
to accomplish a specific task. 

It is clear that globally (in other words not only in relationship to
wordpress), moving forward much more web and intranet development than ever
(and I believe eventually, the majority of,) will be standards based and
compliant. I've spent a large amount of time devoted to and guiding clients
towards this end for at least the past 6 or 7 years. It's not always easy,
many folks are resistant to make major migrations and changes needed to
bring things up to speed. I think the fact that MS for example with the
release of IE 7 has embraced completely the w3c standards and accepted them
as presented speaks volumes about the need for folks to not only be more
aware of standards compliance, but work towards adopting them in all future
efforts. MS also has recently released a new development environment called
MS Expression Web Designer (along with other Expression suite tools), which
completely adhere to things like the w3c XHTML and CSS standards. 

Personally, as an independent consultant I was a MS certified solutions
provider from 1995-2002, however, beginning in around 1997 I abandoned most
MS related development work in favor of migrating to open source and
standards compliance due to the extremely proprietary direction things were
headed at MS at the time. I know that I made the correct choice. Almost
every MS server environment has failed to be as widely deployed as they
expected, and my belief is that that's due to the proprietary "spin" they
put on everything. It's clear that the MS direction has finally changed, so
it seems to me pretty short sighted and irresponsible for any serious
developer/consultant, etc not to embrace and accept the fact that in
designing new tools, careful attention must be paid to global standards.

Sure, sorry.

Yes, I deliberately put index.php in my permalinks.  I did that on the
advice of the codex, and I don't mind it... My permalink code is:

	/index.php/%category%/%postname%/

You are right, that link you had in there is how my links work.  I'm OK
with the index.php in there, I really don't care about truly pretty
permalinks, but date coding in there is a problem -- a whole lot of what
is (is going to be) on my site will not be the blog, and I want date to
be irrelevant.  That's why I don't have a traditional blog's date code
as part of the permalink structure.

My full .htaccess file is:
-----
ErrorDocument 404 /index.php?error=404
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
# RedirectMatch permanent (.*)index\.html$ $1index.php
-----

Obviously the last line is commented out for testing.  I've had it
before and after the WP rewrite rules, but the order doesn't effect it.

Thanks in advance for your help.
Chris

All this said, though, I guess if I didn't have to have the "index.php"
in the permalink struct, I'd like that.  I remember trying it, and
having some difficulty (don't remember what) so I put in the index.php,
all worked, and so I left it.

Anyway, that's not really the issue.  The whole scheme worked
flawlessly, except previews, with the redirect rule.  And that was the
point of the question :)

Thanks again,

I took a quick glance at the WordPress preview code but I don't
see how your RedirectMatch is affecting it. But, do you realize
that your RedirectMatch will redirect things like
/something/else/abcindex.html to the .php? Is this intended?

Try this, it might even fix the previewing. Put these
three lines before the "BEGIN WordPress" line:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ index.php [L,R=301]

If you are using PATHINFO permalinks (with /index.php/ in the  
middle), you shouldn't be using these WordPress rewrite rules.

Forgive my stupidity, but WP wrote those rules, not me?

If I have these rules, can I change my link structure to remove the
index.php?  I don't mind editing all the links to remove it... What's the
downside?  I have my categories slugs named carefully to avoid conflicts
with internal WP template page names (e.g. archive, category, home, etc.),
so I don't think I'll have conflicts.

Again, forgive my naivet?...

Yes, but I haven't a single .html page in my site.  So I'm OK with that.

I'll give that rewrite rule a try.  Thanks.

It might be because WordPress doesn't use sessions at all. :) It
should work if you use the plugin to call session_start() somewhere,
but it's probably easier to put the variables on the URL.

Thanks everyone for your help here.

Discovered why I had originally used the /index.php form of rewrite -
mod_rewrite wasn't enabled on my test machine, and I didn't see that.
Now it is, and I'm going with a cleaner link structure.  Only 155 pages
to edit <g>

And using the below rewrite rule also solved my preview problem.  Thanks
for the help.

Message-ID: <9017d890606150331i79a41e5fxa4c2d4625dfbcc7f@mail.gmail.com>

First, the list:
I'm sorry, I have to bring this up, because it does cause a problem...
1) Description doesn't respect syndication rules (full text vs. summary)
2) content:encoded doesn't respect syndication rules (no summary)
3) Description AND content:encoded when using full text (need I say more)?

Ok, so that's it, but it presents a big problem.
If I set syndication to full text, description is still only a
summary, yet content:encoded steps in and displays in full text.
What happens to aggregators that don't want HTML?  They get a summary
regardless of setting. (Please don't give me the excuse of "what
aggregator nowadays doesn't render HTML?")

If I set syndication to summary, content:encoded disappears and
description remains a summary.

IMO, a description is describing the post.  It is not abbreviating it,
so here (in my opinion) is how this ALL should work.

Description and content:encoded should NOT be used side by side.  If
they do, they should contain the EXACT same data except one with html,
one entirely plain text.
Ideally, ditch description in it's current form.
A description of the post is, again, a description, not an
abbreviation.  This should be the post excerpt (if set) and nothing
else.

The problem stems from, what happens to the post content?  Should it
all go in content:encoded regardless?  (That's actually not a bad
idea.)
There's no other RSS element suitable to handle post content besides
content:encoded in my opinion.

You know what?  This is nuts.  I think I'm going to start learning
ATOM... (but I still want insight from other syndication-inclined
users/devs.)

I just put in gzip support class-snoopy.php, and made a patch. So now you

This hook [1] , plus use of the global $action (from within the  
hooked function), should get you the results you want:

If you attached a patch to you email it got stripped :-(

Please create a ticket on trac[1] and upload your patch against WordPress
there.  Then we will be able to review and comment on it.

Would it be possible to enforce alphabetical ordering of plugins and tabs on
the options page without breaking any code compatibility?

If you have more than 20 plugins and/or more than 15 tabs it becomes a
nightmare..

 

I'm thinking the plugins page isn't a problem, but the code used to add a
tab might break if you alphabetize the tabs page, no?

Enforcing alphabetical tab ordering seems unnecessary just to help 
organize an edge case user with 15 tabs.  Although with the addition of 
the Privacy tab, the Options tabs are becoming cluttered...

Personally, I'd like to see the ability to add plugin tabs between the 
WP tabs.  The arrays used to create the menus already use numbered array 
keys (incremented by 5 each), it wouldn't be a huge change to allow a 
plugin to specify where they want their tab added.  I presume this 
incrementing by 5 was done with the idea that plugins could add tabs 
between, or am I reading that wrong?  I don't see the reasoning for 
sorting the menus and submenus by array key if plugins can't specify 
their own order anyway.

For instance, "add_menu_page" and "add_submenu_page" could have an 
additional "order" parameter, and if that key number was already taken, 
just increment it until a free key is found.  Is there any harm in 
allowing it?

If the code was implemented for specifying where to add the options tab, 
you could just as easily implement your own preferred ordering 
manually.  Put the more pertinent ones toward the front...

Just my thoughts, best regards,

Ryan Scheuermann

Not really. I assume you're talking about the menus and submenus, and
they're just a pair of global variables, $menu and $submenu. Pick a
hook somewhere after the plugin menus have been added and sort away.

Something like:

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Alphabet Options
Description: Alphabetize "options" submenus
Version: 1
Plugin URI: http://rephrase.net/miscellany/06/alphabetoptions.phps
*/

function alphabetMenu() {
	global $submenu;
	usort($submenu['options-general.php'], 'alphabetMenuSort');
}
function alphabetMenuSort( $a, $b ) {
	return strcmp( $a[0], $b[0] );
}
add_action('admin_head', 'alphabetMenu');
?>

I don't see any point in an alphabetical list but this would be a  
great improvement over what currently becomes a very jumbled and  
incomprehensible list...

Message-ID: <001001c6938e$fe2a4520$fa7ecf60$@net>

I used to be able to view the entire contents of a feed if I selected "Full
Text" in the RSS config pape in wp-admin, but I can't any longer.

I'm (obviously) running WP SVN, and I think that may be part of the problem.

 

My feed (http://neosmart.net/blog/feed/) refuses to show anything past the
<!---more---> tag.

It's a WP thing (I've tried disabling FeedBurner), especially since the more
tag is but a comment with special meaning to WP.

 

I can't replicate this on a stock 2.0.3 blog. 

 

Any ideas?

Ach...
Should have searched trac (did search the support forums though :))

I have to say, I agree with this:

---------------------

I don't think the feed is exactly the machine-readable version of front
page. Feed is the syndication of the article and I think it should be no
relationship between feed and '<!--more-->' tag. I think '<!--more-->' tag
is just a way to control the presentation of the articles in the front page.
'Full text' feed should mean to display the whole content of the article and
if not, why it was called 'Full text' feed? 

---------------------

I really miss that functionality.

Hi all,

Is there a hook for the comments feed list that I can use to filter out a
comment, similar to the_posts?

Thanks,
David

I'm just making sure I'm not missing something in the PHP syntax....

In Classes.php, WP_Query::get_date_permastruct is declared like this
(without any parameters specified):	

function get_date_permastruct() {
[...]
}


In the functions get_year_permastruct() and get_month_permastruct(), it
is called with a parameter like this:
$structure = $this->get_date_permastruct($this->permalink_structure);

Since there is no parameter declared in get_date_permastruct, I'm making
the assumption that this value is ignored.  I just wanted to make
certain that this wasn't PHP syntax for a default value if a return
false or return 0 is called.  That would be a pretty obscure way of
doing default values, but with the rest of this WP code being fairly
clean, its almost surprising to see something wrong.

Am I guessing right that this is just legacy code or something to that
effect and PHP just ignores extra parameters being passed to a function?
Or is there something else going on of which I am unaware?

Ah, thank you Rob.  I've been working in the formal structures of Delphi for
so long that such details have faded in the mysts of time... C seems so
loose sometimes....  

I appreciate the tip and the link.

 I made a post to the misc. section on the WP forums earlier, wondering if
any of you might know of any issues with wordpress and either apache
v.1.3.36 or php 4.4.2, without making you all go look for the forum post,
over the weekend and yesterday, I spent some time working on upgrading my
current system (php 4.3.10, apache 1.3.33 mysql 3.23.54a) to the previously
mentioned version, plus mysql 4.1.xx, bottom line is I have a client that
wants to use sugar crm (the latest version), and since I'm using mod_php4,
the original (which was installed by the hosting company on my
dedicated/colo box) didn't have mbstring support which sugar crm requires,
and there were some funky iconv issues with the old/running system, so I
figured, I go for a major update and compile/install fresh copies of
everything. bottom line is after doing the configures/compiles and
restarting everything with the new version, every site on the server which
uses WP (including my personal site, link in sig, and ALL client sites using
WP), were causing the httpd child process for the request to seg fault. I'm
sure it's got something to do with my new configuration/install of either
php or apache. I've again installed mod_php4 as a static module. the
previous 1.3.33 version also had mod_frontpage compiled in as a static
object (I left that out this time, mostly because I couldn't find a
current/stable mod_frontpage package to include with the build), I'll use
the package I have as a shared module if I really need to use it, but I
don't think I need it, not sure if the problem could be related to that
though, as if you take a look at the WP codex docs section, a while back I
made an addition/correction in the .htaccess file and permalinks area about
problems with WP and frontpage and how to fix them. It's worth noting, that
on all of the sites on the box, things like xoops, phpBB, osCommerce, Typo3,
mediawiki, and many others worked just fine after all the upgrades, really
the last thing I need/needed to do was to upgrade the DB tables to the newer
mysql format and new mysql permissions structure. late last night, after
playing around with it for a while, I changed apache/php/mysql back to the
old versions and re-booted everything, because I needed to make sure all of
my client's sites were online and operational this AM, most importantly the
one's using WP. basically, any time you would request a WP page, the browser
screen would just be blank/white, no errors or anything, the server syslog
showed the seg faults for each httpd process for each request, but there was
no messages/entries in either the httpd access or error log files. 

any ideas ??

ps. I did try starting up a fresh WP install under the updated system, and
that seemed to work OK, but then I quit, because I needed to get the sites
back online, they'd been down for probably 2 hours by then. 

thanks...chris

Subject: [wp-hackers] Inconsistant actions, duplicated code,
	complicated plugins
Message-ID: <a491f91d0606212132p6c987a42je1d82a40607d8156@mail.gmail.com>

While writing my latest plugin, I realized the difficulty and growing
complexity of the admin panel and some of the inconsistancies that
make for a hassle of plugin coding. Particularly, actions for catching
a post before it's deleted, or trying to catch the contents of a post
before its modified. Here's an example, after much digging, of the
logic needed to try and catch a post before it is deleted.

	if($_POST['action'] == 'delete-post' && !empty($_POST['id'])) {
		$id = (int) $_POST['id'];
		$ajax = 1;
	} else if($_GET['action'] == 'delete' && !empty($_GET['post'])) {
		$id = (int) $_GET['post'];
		check_admin_referer('delete-post_' . $id);
	} else if(isset($_POST['deletepost']) && !empty($_POST['post_ID'])) {
		$id = (int) $_POST['post_ID'];
		$post = get_post($id);
		/* Do not check on pages, as there is a missing nonce field here.
		Reported as http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2847 */
		if($post->post_status != 'static')
			check_admin_referer('delete-post_' . $id);
	} else if($_POST['action'] == 'delete-page' && !empty($_POST['id'])) {
		$id = (int) $_POST['id'];
		$ajax = 1;
	}
	if($ajax)
		if ( !check_ajax_referer() )
			die('-1');

All this just to properly get the ID of the posts and know that we can
trust the value (nonces, ajax checks, etc). Manual nonce checking has
to be done, workaround for ajax and non-ajax, different pages and
entry points for deletion.

Would it not make sense for us to make these actions, and all other
similar inconsistancies and duplications, in some way standardized so
that we're not doing so many things and searching through so many
pieces of code? Even if we have to do two checks, one on $_POST for
ajax and one on $_GET for everything else, at least having common
names that are somewhat documentable would be nice. Thoughts?
Comments?

First time I was plus-1ed by Owen, I think, I didn't know if I was being
agreed with or if I was now 1/3 of the way to being put on his
idiots-list.

It was probably both...

Could've been 1/2 of the way there, and likely for good reason,
however, I don't see what it has to do with the thread, so if you
wouldn't mind, take it off list.

I think it was just a light-hearted comment about the ambiguities of

Snoopy itself just uses a socket and creates its own HTTP request, so 
the only thing "wrong" with doing that too is that you'd be reinventing 
the wheel somewhat.

If you don't mind the extra effort then it's fine - there are no 
portability or performance issues, at least none that wouldn't also 
apply to Snoopy.

Don't worry about it guys.  Something I'd said in the past may have rubbed
Mr. Deaton the wrong way, for which, I apologize.  I did come into this
group with a rant on the URL vs. URI and then dove straight into the CSRF
debate.  Not the most genteel introduction, especially in a medium as
ambiguous as email.  I'll just have to diligently try to reverse his
opinion.  I didn't think that this light-hearted comment would have
generated any replies; so, I'm satisfied with this branch of the thread
ending here.

Ah, okay then. I'll stick to my current stuff as it's already coded and 
it logs and errors internally. :)

Does your implementation handle HTTP 3xx Redirections ?

No, it's obvious he just strips the headers.

I too wrote my own retrieval library -- underlying CG-FeedRead and CG-Amazon 
(and upcoming projects...) -- targeting quick XML fetches.  And yes, I dealt 
with the various redirect and other header codes.  After using built-in PHP 
stuff for a while, that then broke on some hosts, then trying one or two 
libraries, which didn't always work, I wrote my own -- just easier at that 
point. ;)

If you're only concerned with WP, definitely use WP facilities.  I've 
written general-purpose solutions, thus didn't want to 'rely' on a given 
platform's includes. :)

But Snoopy is standalone, incredibly stable, flexible and supports 
anything you throw at it, plus it's included with WP... why reinvent the 
wheel with something that's likely to be inferior?

First, what didn't you understand of my comment "If you're only concerned 
with WP, definitely use WP facilities."? ;)

Second, much of what I was up against 2 years ago (or more!) when I laid the 
groundwork was not understanding the actual exchange -- so coding it myself 
just made sense.  Would I switch to another library at some point?  Maybe. 
But I like mine, I know the ins and outs, etc.  If I was starting from 
scratch today, would I use Snoopy (or other libs)?  Probably.  But, today is 
not 2 years ago... ;)

I believe it requires the wp caching be enabled (which is now off by default 
if I recall correclt, and frankly it should be ripped out, only ever put 
back in by a knowledgable sysadmin!), plus a specific comment-subscription 
plugin.

That said, it's a good read on hash vulnerabilities, and the problems of 
multiple 'people' using the same hashes opening up potential security holes. 
Thus always add something unique to your hash. ;)

AFAICS, that vulnerability isn't a WordPress one, but rather a flaw in

Just FYI 

All but one of the attacks described are addressed by the 2.03 release.

The one attack that is still an issue is not a hole in the WordPress, but a
vulnerability in a plugin.

I might misunderstand your question, because I think it is compound. 
Let me see if I've got it:

You want to disambiguate plugin hook names. (pre_add_post, 
ajax_pre_add_post, etc.)
AND
You want any action in which a hook executes (most of them, anyway) to 
have pre and post hooks with valid data available to them.

If I've got that right, then what's your suggestion for solving it?

For posts, it seems simple enough (without looking at any code to verify 
it) to add some hooks around the new-ish add/update/delete post 
functions.  One of the primary things I would like to be able to to with 
pre hooks is to cancel the impending action without bailing completely 
from the script (aka using die()).  Too much to ask, probably, and I 
should just stick to suggesting canceling actions alone.

remote fsock open can be disabled by the server admin.
curl can possibly not exist (but should be used as a fallback, or
maybe as the primary with fsock as the fallback).

This would be what I do :) I use Snoopy with cURL as a fallback since 
the former almost always works and in cases where it has been disabled 
the latter is usually available.

Isn't kses running against all comments 'out of the box'?
I can't even comment with a freaking <q> tag for crying out loud.  And
he wants to say that an open <script> capability exists?

Somebody is either 1) not running stock wordpress 2) has extensive
mods.  Whether core code modification or script level, who knows.

He's just commenting as logged in user with the unfiltered_html 
capability.  Normal visitors won't be able to post script tags to his 
comments.

The flaw is a shared one.  It isn't a flaw in my plugin alone, nor is  
it a flaw in WordPress alone, it is a combined flaw, that enables  
exploitation of a flaw that exists solely in WordPress versions 2.0,  
2.0.1 and 2.0.2.  That is, there was no security risk using my plugin  
until WordPress 2.0 was released.  Because of that, upgrading to  
Subscribe to Comments 2.0.4 OR upgrading to WordPress 2.0.3 closes  
the joint vulnerability (but you should upgrade WordPress to 2.0.3  
anyway, because there are other security issues in 2.0.2).

Basically, I chose a certain md5 hash with a certain salt.  6-12  
months later, WP 2.0 was released with a hash that was salted the  
same way.  If you registered a WP account with your user name as an e- 
mail address, you could get the Subscribe to Comments hash to match  
your WP user hash, and then know the location of your user cache  
files.  You could then use an input sanitization bug in WP to write  
executable data to your user cache file, and you'd know where it was  
located so you could run it.

Steven J. Murdoch, who wrote that article, contacted me almost a  
month ago and relayed this information to me.  I released Subscribe  
to Comments 2.0.4 [1] on May 28th, to protect people until WP 2.0.3  
came out a few days later.

Message-ID: <E32E5907-1358-4763-B8AB-3680D13F2541@codehooligans.com>

Hey all,

This morning I received an urgent client call. I put together this  
site, about 80 pages, a few weeks ago. On this site, are links that  
take the user to an external eCommerce system to purchase products.  
Seems this external system was down so the client wanted me to go  
through the pages and change the links to point to a local page with  
a message that the eCommerce system was down blah blah blah.

I was able to put together a quick JavaScript function to read all  
the anchors on page load and changed the href. So no big issue. Sure  
I could have build some plugin filter to handle this and convert the  
content. But there are some hard-coded menu links and sidebar  
template text not page of page/post content.

I was wondering is there a good way via Apache or whatever to rewrite  
the URL as the page exits the Web server? Meaning to my knowledge for  
example rewrite rules are performed when the user hits the server,  
inbound. I'm looking to see if there is some filter to convert links  
as part of the outbound delivery to the client browser.

I don't expect to find an answer. Just looking to make sure I'm not  
missing something.

JS is a good approach.

Another would be something that output buffers the entire page -- if not 
running an advanced-cache system (i.e., WP-Cache 2), you could hook in 
there, do what it does, but rewrite all links in the html...  Or run a 
modified WP-Cache 2 that does your rewrite AND caches the rewritten 
versions, and then flush it when the system is all back online and disable 
the rewriting.

Two options:

Write an Apache Output Filter - http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/apache/2001/09/13/apache_2.html

Write a WordPress Plugin - Cache the output and replace url's before caching. Serve the cache page. I would go for customizing wp-cache 2 plugin instead of starting from scratch.

Most of our action hooks for deleting things or creating things  
happen AFTER the event.  e.g. delete_post

Why not just create pre_delete_post, and feed the post ID through  
that before deletion?  We could standardize that naming convention  
and create similar hooks for other events.

As for Owen's concern:

We have the new WP_Error class, as well as the is_wp_error()  
function.  How about this:

Have apply_filters()/do_action() check the primary value being passed  
between plugins, after getting it back from each filter/action with  
the is_wp_error() function.  If it returns false, pass the value on  
to the next filter/action.  If it returns true, we echo out a nicely  
formatted list of errors.  We could also have a special wp_error  
action so that the plugin that created the error could echo out  
additional information.  The plugin would add this action to the  
wp_error hook on the fly, at the same time that it determines there  
is an error.

e.g.

> if ('some_condition' == $foo ) {
> 	// error
> 	$return = new WP_Error('foo_happened', 'Sorry, "foo" happened!');
> 	add_action('wp_error', 'thisplugin_error');
> }
> return $return;

then, the thisplugin_error() function could echo out a link to  
documentation, or a link back to the previous page, or (and this is  
where it really gets useful) it could echo out an HTML form with  
buttons corresponding to different paths forward to resolve the error.

Agreed. On second thought, having a set of actions AND a way to cancel
the action would be great. (Owen is pretty darn good at explaining
what I wanted better than I explained it originally.

This sounds hackish, as my first example for this usage was a trashbin
plugin, where this is not an error, and I just want it to silently
fail and redirect back as it normally would, and return success to the
ajax scripts. This would require adding logic around every
action/filter that we wanted this behavior on, as I don't think
non-fatal or non-serious errors should just die out with a message, I
would like to be able to set an error just for myself internally as
well.

Sure, this is nice, but for fatal errors only, and maybe even overkill.

Message-ID: <00bc01c697b8$ae7779c0$0300a8c0@greenville>

 In addition to my "production" projects which use WP, I've also set up a
bunch of test or demo installs, including a number of them for
readers/posters of these forums. I have noticed a couple of issues, and so
would like to pose the following two questions for the group/readers to
consider based on their own experiences. 

1) Site performance. I know there are a number of factors to consider,
ranging from server and hardware to plugins, etc, but recently I set up a
demo site for someone who had an existing blog using another platform, the
old blog had around 3000 posts, with an average of 15-20 comments each.
After importing all of that into WP AND optimizing the DB (MySQL), using
MySQL optimization tools/scripts, etc, the site was barely useable, pages
typically took 6-10 seconds to load based on the WP queries/time output. I'd
like to compile some statistics from users based on real world use, in terms
of how WP sites are performing in terms of page load times, how many
posts/comments site wide, average hits per day, etc. 

2) Database configuration - there is a ton of material written by several
individuals, available concerning sites/servers with more than one WP
install (and I'm not talking about WP MU), and several opinions as to
whether it's better to use a single MySQL database with different table
prefixes for each blog or if it's better to create a  single database for
each blog. Again, the focus is on performance, page load times, average site
traffic per day (visits/hits), total number of posts/comments per site/blog,
etc. 

Why do I care ?

Simple, I've written some material for the WP codex (documentation area of
this site) on a number of topics which I've already posted there. I'm
currently working on some updates for the documentation there which includes
some "best practice" suggestions/alternatives/information on the areas noted
above. Before I make the final updates and additions to the codex, I'd like
to gather as much "real world" user opinion/feedback on the topics as
possible, so that I'm not basing what I've written on only  what I've done
both personally, and for clients, using WP. 

thanks...chris

Agreed.  In many cases not only do I not want to die(), but I might want 
to display my own full response, redirect to somewhere else, or allow 
execution to continue with minor changes.

This isn't to disparage the error class, which is cool.  I think it 
might be generally better design to have the software do something when 
an error occurs other than just display the error.  In that respect, it 
might be a good idea to be able to hook error events in the error class 
so that plugins could handle errors instead.  It's possible that the 
error class already does this - I haven't looked into it too deeply.

Nonetheless, I don't think augmenting the error class is the answer to 
aborting actions from inside hooks, unless there is something 
significant I'm missing.

Subject: [wp-hackers] modify or extend wp-login.php form within plugin
Message-ID: <449DBA7C.6030605@verselogic.net>

I'm working on an authentication extension for Wordpress to allow users 
to register and comment via an OpenID identity. I intend to, upon 
successful external authentication, create real Wordpress users via 
wp_create_user(). However, the question I pose to you applies generally 
to any authentication mechanism, not just OpenID.

I intend to place login boxes in a handful of natural places, such as 
just above the comment field, and sidebar. This is subject to the 
template author's wishes. As a catch-all scenario, I want to add OpenID 
(or other authentication service) login field(s) and button to a form 
inside wp-login.php. I see the following methods for accomplishing this 
feat:

1. Add hooks in wp-login.php in and around the existing login form for 
inserting more fields or another form. The new authentication process 
can be done in wp_authenticate and ended with wp_redirect() and exit(). 
Otherwise return and let the normal wordpress code handle both the login 
attempt and form drawing.

This option seems the cleanest. It tends to follow (my impression of) 
the Wordpress way of doing things. It would be the most resilient to 
future modifications of the core wp-login.php. It breaks backwards 
compatibility with older revisions of Wordpress which lack the new 
hooks. It requires someone to actually add and approve the new hooks. 
Suggestions include some combination of pre_login_form, login_form, 
post_login_form.

2. Hook into wp_authenticate, handling both the new and old 
authentication processes (normally done after that hook in 
wp-login.php), wp_redirect()'ing if needed. If there was no 
authentication attempt, echo() my own form (which looks just like the 
one made by wp-login normally, plus a field or two), and exit().

This option fixes the backwards-compatibility problem. It might have 
forwards-compatibility issues if the core Wordpress wp-login.php does 
something different after wp_authenticate is called, or the form is changed.

3. Hook into wp_authenticate, handling both the new and old 
authentication processes. If there was no authentication attempt, we 
need to draw the form. Load the wp-login.php file into a string, use 
regexes to grab just the form html, modify the string with additional 
fields, and echo() it, and exit()

This tries to fix the forwards-compatibility problem by using whatever 
form design and fields are present in the wp-login.php file. It still 
fails if the code after wp_authenticate in wp-login.php changes.

4. On plugin load, misappropriate the /wp-login.php request, load the 
wp-login.php file into a string, use regexen to drop new content into 
the form, and eval() it. Hook into wp_authenticate to handle only the 
new authentication and exit(), otherwise return().

This option would permit modification of the form, assuming it doesn't 
change too drastically or unexpectedly. It uses the logic of 
wp-login.php, so is immune to changes there. I hate using eval().

5. Do something completely off the wall, like subject the call 
_e('Password Lost and Found') or its ilk to returning the original text, 
plus the ending A tag, plus a whole form, textbox, submit button, ending 
of form, and the beginning of a link to something to balance the 
upcoming ending A tag in the original html. Handle new authentication in 
wp_authenticate hook.

Since the output values are escaped, I cannot, afaik, do this. It's also 
a very Bad Idea. There has to be a better way.


Which of these options (or any other ideas) would be the preferred way 
of inserting additional fields into the form generated by wp-login.php?

6. Or, as I neglected to paste, using Output Buffering. Hook into 
wp_authenticate. If we have successful external auth, handle it, 
redirect and exit. Otherwise, ob_start("foo") and return. If successful 
internal wp auth, it'll redirect normally, as headers are not blocked by 
output buffering. If the form gets echo()'d, the script will reach the 
end of the page, and the function foo() called with the form in a 
string. (Much better than reading the file into a string.) In the ob 
handler, parse form regexen to inject extra fields, and return the string.

Still has forwards compatibility issues, but not /nearly/ as fugly.

I'm the author of wpblogmail, which sends daily or weekly "digest"  
email summaries of activity on a WP blog:

http://www.birdhouse.org/blog/software/wpblogmail/

It's not a plugin, but a cli php script, alongside a WP install. It  
basically does this:

----------
require("$BlogPath/wp-blog-header.php");
the_title_rss();
permalink_single_rss();
the_content_rss('', TRUE, '', 100);
----------

which it spits out to the shell, which then emails it to a list  
address. Works nicely, *except* when the user has a contact form  
plugin installed, *even though* that plugin is not used on the  
homepage of the blog. When either pxsmail or the Dagon form mailer  
plugins are activated and wpblogmail is run, I get this at the top of  
the output, and I can't figure out why. Any idea why these plugins  
are invoked at all in this situation? And is there a way to  
deactivate them while the script runs, or another way around this  
anyone can think of?

The Dagon plugin runs session_start() when it's loaded, which tries to
set a session cookie. It probably shouldn't, but there's nothing you
can do about it.

You get "headers already sent" warnings because you've echoed
something in your script before the other plugin tries to send the
cookie header.

Do you still get them if you don't 'echo $header;' until *after*
including wp-blog-header.php ?

Hi,

I  know  this does not address your question  directly,  but
have  you considered third-party services, which can achieve
merely  the same thing? RSSFWD(.com), for example, is a Ruby
On  Rails-based service that will deliver updates from  your
blogs  by E-mail, even in clustered/digest mode, which is  a
recently-added  feature.  In  almost a year,  it  has  never
missed a beat.

Hope it helps,

Roy

But what's calling the Dagon plugin to begin with? Shouldn't it only  
be called when user clicks through to a page that includes a contact  
form? Same deal with PXSMail. Or are all WP plugins called on all  
page requests? (If so, that seems very innefficient - is there any  
way to suppress that behavior?)

Yep, tried that - same problem :(

Now that I've thought about the problem a lot more, it seems that, in
lieu of the requisite hooks, Output Buffering is by far the best
solution. And it's unlikely that any future revision of wp-login's
output will lack the text '</form>' any time soon, so it'll be fairly
resilient.

In contrast, wp-register lacks any unique actions or filters, so I'm
stuck doing a compare like ($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] == '/wp-register.php')
to output buffer and alter its form.

Hmmm... neat service. Looks like it sends out new mail whenever  
there's a new post on the site, rather than waiting a week (or a day,  
or whatever) and  sending all posts accumulated since then.  
wpblogmail sends only posts that have accumulated since the last time  
the script was run. Not a show stopper for rssfwd, but I know my  
readers like getting the weekly digests. But will keep this in mind,  
thanks.

Ah, just noticed their "clustered" option. Will try that and see how  
it goes.

Though I would like to get wpblogmail working properly. The  
alterative would be to re-write it with direct database requests,  
like my old mtblogmail was, but it seems so much cleaner and more  
efficient to use WP's native calls to do all the heavy lifting.

A WP directive to "disable all plugins on page request" would solve  
the problem neatly.

all plugins are included any time wp is loaded up -- it is up to the plugins 
to 'decide' whether or not to execute (i.e., I have some that turn 
themselves off when the page loading is under wp-admin/).

Process goes something like:

wp-blog-header.php
-> wp-config.php
-> wp-settings.php
-> setup wp caching stuff
-> twenty other files...
-> all plugins
-> setup query and rewrite objects
-> init main object, parse the request, send headers, run db query for 
posts...
-> template-loader.php

This is why when people ask if they should directly include WP in order to 
show recent entries on a home page or something, I tell them to use a 
caching feed-aggregator script, as including WP has a ton of overhead even 
if only looking at code loaded... ;)

You really can't do that.  Plugins could be live-modifying the content... ;) 
Many of mine do!

Well, I shouldn't say "can't".  You could do that, if you knew a priori that 
you're not running any plugins with any content/excerpt/rss processing.

Like David said, all plugins are *loaded*. Most plugins only register
their functions to fire on specific hooks, but there's nothing
stopping them doing more.

Is it the exact same error? Because, FWIW, that fixes it for me.
There's nothing else being output before wp-blog-header is included,
not even whitespace?

I've noticed this to be an issue for a while, sometimes doesn't happen with
"out of the box" install, only after certain modifications. I don't even
have the default theme installed on my "production" site anymore, but  I did
develop a fix for the issue a while back for a client who was using
"selectable" themes, and including that one. I'll dig out the code if it's a
help. 

you should be able to view the error at www.hradil.us/sandbox in the WP
install there, because I didn't apply the patch to that one yet. 

the more I think about it, the client I made the fix for, was using xoops
with the WP 2.x.x. plugin, and I think at the time I chalked it up to a
xoops thing since I hadn't noticed it before in a standalone WP install.
I'll post the code later.

BTW, this shift is not present in Opera 9, the only one (from the big three) that renders it correctly.
It wasn't present in Firefox 1.0, but became present in 1.1+ (internal test builds) and in 1.5
It has always been present in IE.

I'm assuming (I've just been to busy/lazy to go check for myself) that as
more items are added to the list of services to "ping" for each post (like
with the smart ping plugin, etc), the response time of your "write a post"
page will get slower and slower. Am I correct ? I've set up a site for a
client with the smart ping plugin, and it just seems to take forever to
"publish" a post, like up to a minute or more every time. I added the plugin
to my personal site just to see if that was it, and the same thing seems to
be happening. anyone know a way around this slowdown issue ?


thanks.chris

Hmm... well, this only runs for two seconds, once a week. But using  
Magpie or similar for this is definitely an interesting possibility.  
Except I'm not sure how I'd keep track of what's already been sent  
without record IDs coming from the database. Would probably be OK for  
weekly runs, but would be overkill to send full feeds for people  
using it for daily runs. But it's an interesting approach, thanks.

D'oh! I think I just found the problem - yep, a bit of output where I  
didn't know I had any. Working neatly now.  Thanks for the kick in  
the pants everyone.

Hello !

I would like to start developping a plugin that will allow public
users to send an sms to a server (smsconnect) and to receive back a
code that they'll be able to use in order to display the content of a
post.

Do you know if there is some similar project ?

Is there a link to this plugin, or  is he supposed to "get that" by osmosis
or ESP? ;) I know many plugins but the oly "subscription plugin" I know of
is Subscribe to Comments and that would not come near doing what he is
looking to do, so I must assume you're referring to a different one.

Hi Aaron and Christopher,

Thank you guiys for your input.
Yep i'm afraid that the subscription plugin that you're talking about
doesn't really fit my requested features, but maybe i just didn't find
what you were talking about Christopher ?

The closest project that i've found so far is one published (well the
bid request only) here
http://www.getafreelancer.com/projects/PHP/Subscription-Plugin-Wordpress.html

I'm a bit sad because i really would like to publish the subscription
plugin under GPL licence...

Do you have some other suggestions or should start coding from scratch now ?

Best regards,

Why make this so hard?

1. you need to have a process that checks and verifies sms messages.
2. if message passes constraints send access code

This should all be done without touching the WP code.

3. ability to toggle posts based off of access code.

This is the only hook that you need.

This is fairly straightforward I would recommend checking into the Captcha
plugins as the functionality is essentially the same.

Actually, can't you already password-protect posts?  in which case, you're 
just sending out the 'password' to the post.  You could do that right now, 
no further work.

If you want to be a bit more secure, you'd generate a password based on the 
'real' post password plus the person's phone #/sms address, and then have 
them enter their phone # and the generated password to validate/view.

If you want to be even more secure, you'd have people register on your site, 
register their sms phone number, and potentially generate a 'private 
password' that's only good for that person for that post, storing it in 
their user metadata (so the 'purchase' is recorded in their account).  Then 
they never have to enter a thing, just by logging into their account they 
can see anything they 'unlocked'.

I was assuming he'd be able to search and find it on his own without me
needing to go and do it for him, I'm aware of the comments subscription
plugin, 
there's also one floating out there somewhere which allows you to chose
categories which are only available for viewing by "paid" subscribers, I'm
guessing he'd be able to use that with some modification to get what he
needs, if I have to, I'll spend the time to go locate it for him.

Hi Nathan,

Thank you for your help.
Effectively you describe quite simply the basis for this plugin it
seems less difficult now.

Before Step one i need a kind of reference code for each post, for
example the user will have to send the sms to
http://www.smsconnect.com/ with a specific code (in order to receive a
specific unlock code for the desired post).

Step one will be linked with smsconnect's API i hope

Step 2 seems to not be necessary if step1 is ok

Step 3 as you said i might need to tweak the toggle feature

Thank you for the advice about the captcha plugins i'm gonna look at it.

Thank you everyone for your precious inputs.

What you need to do is setup a table that creates a random code for a
post... this would be a simple WP hook when you post an article it creates
the code and associates it to the post id. Or you could put a field in the
advance fields on the post admin page so you could override it with your own
code when you post the article; again easy to do with WP hooks. I suggest
going through the codex site for specifics.

Then when someone sends an sms, you can do a look up for that code if its
not in the table no access, if it is they get access. However this seems
very clumsy to me. I have to enter a new code for each article. Then I also
have the issue of distributing the codes to the users.

I personally feel that you should be using some type of ACL to manage this
project, because then you would have room to grow. Then you can assign
members based on subscription types to different groups or topics. Then you
could have a drop down list or a hierarchical checkbox list just like the
categories for a post. Then you don't have to worry about the code
assignment or memorization. In this system each user would have there own
unique code. This way you could lock out a user even if they have a code so
there is more security and less change of a system compromise. You could
have the code be assigned when the user creates there account. Or it could
be as simple as the phone number they are SMSing from.


I personally don't think what your trying to do has any good code examples
out there. I think for scalability and ease of use you should probably
create this plugin from scratch.

What you refer to at the end there is what I outlined in my earlier email as 
the 'more secure' system...  But no extra 'ACL' really, just store the 
'purchased' access codes in the user's metadata, which would require users 
to register to use your system.  Whether the access codes are per-post or 
for a 'category' of posts is (somewhat) up to the need/use of the system.

The 'less secure' system can still be done easily, it's just less secure. 
(see my earlier email for the various incarnations I outlined.. ;) ).

I see you already got some responses on the wp-testers list. Welcome! 
I'd second the thought that Trac or the wp.org support forums are the 
best way to get started. Also writing a plugin (and supporting it) can 
be hugely educational for getting to know WordPress and for the 
community to get to know you.

Matt,

thank you for the response and the welcome. I will check on the above

 At the least, I'd love a way to specifically set which blocks are shown,

 just musing... ;)


 I thought some of this was discussed when the new ajaxified UI was rolled

Hello All,

I?m working on a plugin (same one I?ve been working on forever), and

I?m almost done, but I need a way to check the HTTP headers. I know how

to send a header, and I think I have an apache-specific solution for

getting this info, but I need a more global way of doing it.

 

Specifically, I want to find out if a person arrived to a page via a

301-redirect:

i.e.

If person goes:

Domain.com -> page1 ---301--> page2

 

My plugin is normally sitting on page 1, but I don?t want it to kick in

if page 1 ended up redirecting to page 2.

 

Any ideas?

 

Thanks!

you could check the referer, set a cookie or use some GET variables,
but there is afaik to solution to detect if the previous page has sent
a 301 redirect.

I tend to agree. Someone whom I taught WordPress (1.2) never
knew  what  the  post  slug was, even  after  18  months  of
blogging...  but I believe that the plus/minus at the top of
the  boxes  is intended to address this already. It  reduces
clutter.

Hmmm....  that's  /more/  options.  The  option  to  disable
options. Leads to circularity...

I  think the main deficiency is accessibility. This downside
was raised by Mike Little.

I've chimed in on this subject several times in the past. There are a large
number of potential conflicts involved with including an .htaccess file with
a WP distribution, one example is the use of MS frontpage extensions, which
are installed on many shared and dedicated servers, in many cases the apache
distribution used by hosting providers is compiled with mod_frontpage which
relies on .htaccess for authoring control, etc. I've added a large amount of
information to the codex regarding the use of WP and (or on a server with)
the Ms Frontpage extensions. See - 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Permalinks.2C_.htaccess.2C_and_M
S_Frontpage

I need to go back and make some additional notes and modifications based on
some new information when I have a chance, but that's it in a nutshell as
far as MS Frontpage. 

Further, in my opinion, it's one thing to ask folks to make changes to
.htaccess/apache if they WISH to use a feature such as permalinks, however
it's not right to mandate what amounts to a change in the web server
configuration in order to use the product. I'm pretty sure no one would like
the idea of someone coming along with a plugin that REQUIRED a user to gut
the core WP files.

Comment (by Brian Layman):

 I do not agree with this suggestion.

 This cause WP to override any .htaccess files that are configured above
the WordPress directory.  Additionaly, and it will make the upgrade  process
more difficult as this is a file that could be overwritten very  easily when
uploading an update.  If I lost my .htaccess file, it would  require a good
bit of scrambling to get the contents restored. (Which  reminds me it is
time for another backup....)

 AFAIK, .htaccess is only created by WordPress if you change your permalink
structure.  So most installs rely on the .htaccess configured by there web
provider.  1and1.com for instance has a special thing for converting the
urls to upper or lower case as appropriate.  If I put a custem perma link
structure, and thus create a .htaccess file, that behavior is lost.

Actually, the point was to look at the 'blocks' on the edit panel as if they 
were plugins, or widgets might be a better analogy.  Somewhere to turn them 
on and off at a master level, plus somewhere to set how they lay out 
(globally, for all users, the default state -- and not per-user cookie or 
something...).

People don't need some of those things around.  Setting up more 'CMS' like 
sites for other users/companies finds a need for eliminating all non-needed 
interfaces, possibly rearranging the rest, including leaving things open 
(excerpt at the bottom is a pain, just as example).

As WP gets adopted by more site designers/builders for projects, handing the 
site off to truly novice users means the interface has to get much more 
streamlined, more stuff can be easily disabled (for 'lower' users) and 
hidden, etc.

Again, just IMHO.

I'm with you on this one.
Even more than Frontpage: IIS.
If a plugin relies solely on .htaccess, it will undoubtedly break upon
porting to IIS (which has its own "mod_rewrite" called ISAPI Rewrite).

Interesting. Before reading the paragraph in its entirety, I
was  about to say that you cannot treat mandatory fields  as
'plugs'.  I  am  now  thinking  along  the  lines  of  "hide
categories  from users", at least until they deem  necessary
(expansion  of  site,  as  well as  skills).  It  makes  the
learning  curve more staged, cumulative as new elements  are
introduced  gradually,  as soon as the user is prepared  for
them.

The Apple/Windows approach would say that this leads to lack
of  uniformity.  Excessive  extensibility  (e.g.  KDE  as  a
toolbox  rather  than a window manager) could, in due  time,
make maintenance and support harder.

I quite likd(d) Hello Dolly, but I must admit that it is/was
impractical.  It  serves/ed as a good template  for  plug-in
creators  nonetheless. We'll always have Matt's Jazz  Quotes
page, even if it gets dropped from the trunk distribution...

I'm  thinking  along the lines of balloons (tooltips).  This
seems to be the direction that KDE 3.4+ has taken; these can
be  disabled too. To match the beauty of CSS+JS in WP 2.0.x,
why  not  use MIT's nicetitles for translucent  popups  with
rounded corners?

People  will rarely read manuals. Some like to embark on the
unknown by doing prior reading, but most just learn by trial
and  error.  So I think an assistive yet obtrusive tips  are
the best way to go.

Just my humble opinion,

Roy

One word: bloat.
At its core, WP doesn't have superfluous AJAX - especially not
globally-compatible AJAX.
Balloons are for programs - not for scripts. If you make balloons a part of
WP-core, you're in trouble.

But it doesn't matter: balloons aren't a replacement for "Hello Dolly," but
Andy's idea is. Your idea is something totally different, no?

I quite likd(d) Hello Dolly, but I must admit that it is/was impractical.  It  serves/ed as a good template  for  plug-in creators  nonetheless. We'll always have Matt's Jazz  Quotes page, even if it gets dropped from the trunk distribution...

I'm  thinking  along the lines of balloons (tooltips).  This seems to be the direction that KDE 3.4+ has taken; these can be  disabled too. To match the beauty of CSS+JS in WP 2.0.x, why  not  use MIT's nicetitles for translucent  popups  with rounded corners?

People  will rarely read manuals. Some like to embark on the unknown by doing prior reading, but most just learn by trial and  error.  So I think an assistive yet obtrusive tips  are the best way to go.

Just my humble opinion,

Roy

Agreed. Hello Dolly was very important for me to understanding how  
the plugin system in WP works, particularly add_action() and the idea  
of plugin hooks ('admin_footer', 'admin_head'). Perhaps it would have  
been nice to have an example of add_filter() as well.

The fact that the status/location of the options boxes is cookie-based
has been driving me batty. I know I'm not the only person who blogs
from more than one machine, and having to reposition those to my
tastes on each PC is rather annoying. Users who don't know about
cookies and database tables and all that geeky stuff that we take for
granted would probably see this is a bug when they login from a second
(or third) computer: "Oh, WP forgot where I had my boxes."

I always delete this plugin, and if it is a good tool for new coders
to learn from, then that's fine. I really don't care if it's there or
not.

Expanding on the plugin idea here, and taking this more OT, (my
apologies) but I'd like to see some more functionality in the Plugin
Admin panel.

Specifically, I'd like the plugins to be sorted by status
(activated/deactivated) and then alphabetically. Also, I'd like to
have a way of deleting the plugin from the panel itself. Perhaps both
of these functions would be best done via a plugin (oh the irony) but
I just thought I would put those thoughts out there.

Incidentally, getting back to Hello Dolly, I find it interesting that
even though I've been a WPer since 2003, Andy's post about the plugin
being a good starting point for new plugin devs is news to me. You
learn something new every day, eh?

This is a very good idea (avoiding the mention of popups).  If it gets
logged in trac, I suspect it will be +1'd into existence the core quickly...

"Hello Dolly" did give WP a nice flavor (I do still have it running on one
or two sites), but I think tips would be more beneficial - even if today I
would probably turn it off.

It  would seem rational to just have two 'boxes' (not  boxes
per  se), where one corresponds to inactive plugins and  one
contains  plugins currently in use. A drag and drop facility
would be beneficial, as well (as long as a fallback exists).

On  plug-in deletion, I can't say that it's a wise step. You
can  then have plug-ins that reach a state of  invisibility,
or  oblivion. There is a common design flaw wherein an  item
is  greyed out, yet you have no indication of how to make it
reachable. This can be very, very frustrating.

Today  I learned (the hard way) that my back will ache if  I
stride  too  fast, but as you said, it's "taking  this  more
OT". *smile*

Best wishes,

Sounds like more useless Web 2.0 OMGAJAX bloat to me.

Heh, news to me too.


Anyways, I love the idea of tips, sounds like a great way to make the
plugin more useful while keeping its benefits as a plugin for new
devs. On the other hand, I don't want to see balloon tips in the
administration panel. It will remind users of the annoyances that they
get when they turn their windows machines on.

"You have unused items on your desktop"
"Your updates are ready to install"
"Automatic updates is disabled"
"Your computer may not be secure"

All these things popuping up constantly is enough for even the average
non-geeky user to learn to shun the balloons and everything they stand
for, and likely they'd just shun the WordPress balloons as well. I'm
up for other ideas on how to make it stand out, but damn are those
balloons annoying enough as it is.

Good idea... but while you're at it, why not externalize the list of
"lyrics"/"tips"?   Then default to run off the tips file, but include
the Dolly file in the distro if anyone wants to.

Incidentally, I switched out the lyrics with Bauhaus's "The Passion of
Lovers", but that's just me....

It would help if you replied directly to the messages ;P

But yes, I agree. AJAX isn't the be-all end-all it's made out to be, but
nevertheless, it is the _only_ way the web can represent a true application
platform.
AJAX provides a (theoretically) seamless way for data-streaming of GET/POST
without refreshing or reloading a page - but in 99.9% of the circumstances
it's 100% un-necessary.

Look at where AJAX is used in WP (fading boxes for messages, and the
widgets bar - nothing else AFAIK).
The first is useless: pretty, but useless
The second is broken in many browsers - rendering it useless.

That's a good idea - so many "spin-offs" of Hello Dolly have been
redistributed as new plugins - it would be much easier to make it use one
or more installable lists instead. (Y)

That's 100% true, and something that I forgot to mention.
But besides the WP-Core, one just has to look at the plethora of WP-Plugins
that make life so much easier with the use of AJAX (Tag Warrior!!!)...

What we're saying here isn't anything that hasn't before been said and
discussed in very great detail on newsgroups and IRC channels all around
the web, and there is no good answer.

AJAX is obviously here to stay, and everyone agrees that too much of a good
thing is terrible.
But the problem is, no two can decide on just how much is too much; hence
all the problems we're having with AJAX and Web 2.0 in general.

There is no "safe" way to limit AJAX and completely removing it in
standards is a preposterous and impossible suggestion, it all goes back to
us Devs and what we make of it - the same with any other technology.

Ta  muchly for the defence. I suppose that AJAX falls  under
these  recurring  debates  that involve  tradeoffs:  feature
bloat,    system   requirements,   functionality   available
(portability), Openness, and backward compatibility.

In  favour  of  AJAX: more 'natural'  interfaces,  can  save
time/increase   productivity,   etc.  On  the  other   hand,
accessibility   is   compromised  (browser   features)   and
complexity of the code raised, which bad in terms of volume,
performance   and  access  to  programmers  (think   Windows
Vistaster if it helps).

Best wishes,

Roy

Yeah... i actually must say I do stray a TAD toward the use-ajax  
extreme, if only for two reasons:

1) I disagree with you - I'd say that in 99.9% of cases, AJAX is  
40-50% useless. Decoration is *not* useless - a good user experience  
is essential to any application, any site, any... anything. I used to  
host on MediaTemple - then switched to DreamHost because they were  
cheaper. As soon as I got in, I looked at the control panel and  
though *euck* - but I put up with it, hell it was cheaper and  
everything else in the features seemed better. Guess what? The  
support SUCKED. At least, compared to (mt)'s unofficial 10-minute  
rule. I go back to mediatemple, notice how well designed and clean  
the control panel is - easy to find anything, fun to use - and the  
overall hosting experience was BETTER! Ever used Plesk? It is  
TORTURE. Because it is so horribly designed and laid out. My point is  
that good design, an *enjoyable* interface is not only AN element of  
a good service - it is an _ESSENTIAL_ element of a good service! So  
using AJAX for decoration isn't not only a bad thing, it can be a  
good thing (this works the other way around, however - you can use  
too much AJAX, make the user sick of it, and WORSEN their experience;  
and again, AJAX is only an element, and a relatively new one at that,  
of that elusive creature _good design_)

2) I am a Rails developer. Adding AJAX effects in rails is like  
wearing a different pair of pants, you know, the cool jeans, instead  
of those old stuffy khakis. No extra work really, just a decision.

The only real PROBLEM with AJAX is when people use it and *DON'T*  
provide obvious alternatives. It's the rule of developers, if you use  
a technology to make a task easier for your user, make sure that task  
can be done (albeit a bit less easy, perhaps) WITHOUT the technology.  
When people fail to do this, AJAX is blamed. It's a techie case of  
'Guns don't shoot people, people shoot people', nothing more.

I have to disagree with you entirely then...

Decoration most certainly isn't useless, and every point you make is 100%
valid - but I don't see why you need AJAX to do it.
Certainly - the widgets plugin would be a lot less comfortable to use
without AJAX, but how much harder are drop-down boxes with numbers in them
that determine the order (the same forums are ordered in IPB, phpBB, etc.)

Decoration doesn't need AJAX: it never has, and it never will solely rely
on it.
Some of the best designed sites don't use AJAX - I never said design wasn't
important, nor did I ever think that, but I don't think _AJAX_ is important
for design.

CPanel, Helm, Plesk, whatnot: none use AJAX, yet some are easy to use while
others aren't. Nothing to do with AJAX, but everything to do with how much
time the Devs wanted to spend on planning the design and making it easy to
use.


But I _do_ see your point, very well too. Look at Digg.com: the only reason
it's more popular than the other user-provided and rated services before it
is that it makes it all easier: no need to reload a page to "digg" and
item: just click as many buttons as you want. (compare that to ratings on
Slashdot - eugh!)

So, yeah, Decoration isn't useless, but 99.9% of the time using AJAX for
decoration is.

I agree. Key word: solely.

I disagree. See above.

It can be used to aid design - a good design can become even better  
with AJAX; or become much, much worse. Same as images - a design can  
become much, much better with proper use of images, and become much,  
much worse with too many / badly done ones. It's all subjective, and  
too much of anything is a bad thing when it comes to design. A good  
designer can make a page with nothing but HTML and CSS, and black and  
white with straight lines look more attractive than a bad designer  
can make a page with flashy images and AJAX and Flash accents and all  
sorts of tools. These are just that - tools, nothing more - they are  
what you make of them. It's how good the designer is that matters,  
not how good the tools are.

Just to add to this, many of the examples of 'decoration' are DOM+JS, and 
NOT Ajax.  Using JS for 'decoration' is extremely useful.  Effects and 
animation make the interface richer, easier to understand, draw the eye to 
important elements, etc.

Also, a portion of what is called Ajax these days is really Ajah (that is, 
html body, not repackaging everything into xml...).  There's actually a 
handful of different approaches to using JS for client-server exchange, so 
Ajax really is over-used even within its 'sphere'...

But after that exchange, it's back to plain JS to play with the elements, 
plus basic HTML, CSS, graphics, etc., to make things interesting when 
'static'.  The exchange is only one piece of the equation of JS interfaces, 
and yes it's the part that makes it Ajax or Ajah or Jah or whatever... 
But, let's not accidentally label JS effects as Ajax... ;)

I have to disagree with you entirely then...

Decoration most certainly isn't useless, and every point you make is 100%
valid - but I don't see why you need AJAX to do it.
Certainly - the widgets plugin would be a lot less comfortable to use
without AJAX, but how much harder are drop-down boxes with numbers in them
that determine the order (the same forums are ordered in IPB, phpBB, etc.)

Decoration doesn't need AJAX: it never has, and it never will solely rely
on it.
Some of the best designed sites don't use AJAX - I never said design wasn't
important, nor did I ever think that, but I don't think _AJAX_ is important
for design.

CPanel, Helm, Plesk, whatnot: none use AJAX, yet some are easy to use while
others aren't. Nothing to do with AJAX, but everything to do with how much
time the Devs wanted to spend on planning the design and making it easy to
use.


But I _do_ see your point, very well too. Look at Digg.com: the only reason
it's more popular than the other user-provided and rated services before it
is that it makes it all easier: no need to reload a page to "digg" and
item: just click as many buttons as you want. (compare that to ratings on
Slashdot - eugh!)

So, yeah, Decoration isn't useless, but 99.9% of the time using AJAX for
decoration is.

Subject: Re: [wp-hackers] AJAX

Yeah... i actually must say I do stray a TAD toward the use-ajax extreme, if 
only for two reasons:

1) I disagree with you - I'd say that in 99.9% of cases, AJAX is 40-50% 
useless. Decoration is *not* useless - a good user experience is essential 
to any application, any site, any... anything. I used to host on 
MediaTemple - then switched to DreamHost because they were cheaper. As soon 
as I got in, I looked at the control panel and though *euck* - but I put up 
with it, hell it was cheaper and everything else in the features seemed 
better. Guess what? The support SUCKED. At least, compared to (mt)'s 
unofficial 10-minute rule. I go back to mediatemple, notice how well 
designed and clean the control panel is - easy to find anything, fun to 
use - and the overall hosting experience was BETTER! Ever used Plesk? It is 
TORTURE. Because it is so horribly designed and laid out. My point is that 
good design, an *enjoyable* interface is not only AN element of a good 
service - it is an _ESSENTIAL_ element of a good service! So using AJAX for 
decoration isn't not only a bad thing, it can be a good thing (this works 
the other way around, however - you can use too much AJAX, make the user 
sick of it, and WORSEN their experience; and again, AJAX is only an element, 
and a relatively new one at that, of that elusive creature _good design_)

2) I am a Rails developer. Adding AJAX effects in rails is like wearing a 
different pair of pants, you know, the cool jeans, instead of those old 
stuffy khakis. No extra work really, just a decision.

The only real PROBLEM with AJAX is when people use it and *DON'T* provide 
obvious alternatives. It's the rule of developers, if you use a technology 
to make a task easier for your user, make sure that task can be done (albeit 
a bit less easy, perhaps) WITHOUT the technology.
When people fail to do this, AJAX is blamed. It's a techie case of 'Guns 
don't shoot people, people shoot people', nothing more.

My bad. I always associate the two. Lets say... what I've been  
talking about as AJAX is really live interaction with the user, minus  
a pageload. User input to the server, output from the server to the  
user, with no loading of a new page - how's that?

It seems to me that a proper internet client should deliver that behavior
without any special client side information.  On most websites, blogs in
particular, when a page is reloaded the client should update only what has
changed.  

Just as in old school computer animation optimizations where you only erase
what changed and redraw those parts, the internet client should be able to
do a diff of the last page and the current page and only redraw the altered
areas.  If the client observes DOM, it's already half way there.  Maybe now
that AJAX is giving people an idea of what a smooth interface looks like,
and broadband allows fast transfer of the page source, we'll start to see
some browsers start to come with that functionality.

In the meantime, I think I prefer the static interface on the admin pages by
default.  I will wait until such a thing as a WP-Admin theme becomes
available that optionally adds Ajax to the interface in a easily
downgradeable fashion.

Actually you raise quite an interesting point:
Is the web dead?

I mean, AJAX can only do so much. The things that you mention - those are
far more complicated than HTML can ever provide.

Couldn't 10 years from now the internet become compiled code? No longer PHP
and Ruby but C++ and .NET?
That is really the only way this entirely "dynamic" style you mention could
take form.. or so I see it.

I didn't even realize what list I was talking on, sorry - hell I  
don't know why I'm suscribed to this, I just noticed somebody dissing  
AJAX as 100% useless again, which pisses the hell out of me. Elliott  
Cable out (oh and I was never suggesting you implement AJAX into a  
hidden admin-only control panel, on the contrary, the tinyest chance  
of error or thinking something has happened when it hasn't or worst  
thinking something hasn't happened when it has - that's bad for a  
simple admin interface)

the language have to do with it? This is how the information is

God forbid. Compiled languages are teh evil. And what on earth does the language have to do with it? This is how the information is interpreted - ruby is just a language. It doesn't have anything to do with this. And PHP can die, please, thanks.

PHP won't, can't, and has no reason to, die.

It's an easy but very powerful language. Just like C++ without all that the
hard stuff, and even with the hard stuff C++ will never die.

PHP built server-side as we know it, and it's here to stay. I personally
don't like PHP, but that's just the technical points of it - PHP will
continue to evolve so long as people use it, and people will use it if it
evolves - so we're here for a loooooong time.

Yeesh, I say "I think I prefer the static interface on the admin pages by
default." and that's interpreted as "AJAX is 100% useless"?  AJAX DEFINITELY
has its uses and it is employed all over my personal site. I especially like
the way it is used in my search box, bringing up all matching posts for each
word as you enter it.

If you asked about using downgradable AJAX in the default WP Theme, then I'd
be whole heartedly on your side.  I just personally prefer administration
interfaces to be static, very clean and very tight.  The bells and whistles
can be saved for the masses...  Others may dissagree. but that's where some
form of WP-Admin themes may be useful (if a little scary).

It's distributed to the masses :)

And there are WP Admin themes (

be semi-popular (

Agreed, this has bothered me from some time.

Actually, to expand, the whole dragging collapsing boxes as a concept
altogether is annoying to me. To me, its a bandaid fix for a poorly
designed UI. Not saying that I can do better (so please, not another
one of those, where's the patch then e-mails, Matt), but I surely
would've thought the Shuttle team would've made some changes to fix
all of that, since the boxes once expanded are ugly as can be. But
then again, I guess Shuttle was always a "beautification" which means
nothing to having a UI that makes sense.

One idea that I wouldn't mind, and might be a great way of working
this all out, is doing a WP Widget's style "Customize" page, where for
the right hand side instead of those boxes which take up an awful lot
of screen real-estate in their closed state, we just have the actual
form titles and input fields and such as necessary, dragged and
dropped and rearranged so that the write page itself is always the
same and doesn't have any unnecessary drag and drop nonsense. This
also solves the cookie issue, and with a little work or a plugin API
could be used to set up the default styles for the post screen.

I haven't had time to read this whole thread, so whatever I say may be
duplicated. Sorry, but I'm not reading through 19 pages of e-mails to
defend myself.

The original point of this wasn't really necessarily an attack on
simply AJAX, but more on the whole Web 2.0 and "Everything needs AJAX"
(even if its just javascript they'll call it AJAX, proof: read
http://digg.com for 1 week.) The point being, why do we need two boxes
and drag and drop to enable and disable plugins. Is an enable and
disable button not intuitive enough. Hell, do with what the rest of
the admin panel does and have it fade out nicely and be disabled with
AJAX if you must, but Drag and Drop instead of a disable vs enable
buttons is the point where things become rediculous. AJAX isn't a bad
thing, just like the many other buzzwords aren't bad things, but there
comes a point where everything's just overboard and silly.

Is this a comprehensive list of dangerous entities that can be encoded? 
Might be best to take a whitelist approach here instead for a set of 
encoded entities or a fixed range.

they hit the "hackers" list instead, I'm not exactly sure why, I never got

Is it even necessary to strip those? Aren't they only dangerous (for
HTTP response splitting, etc.) if they're urldecoded?

Oy, I was thinking to myself as I wrote that "Saying this will guarantee

Message-ID: <70055a110606292158g1e713a93la8c1184f4fd0ba01@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks for helping.  I use hooks for post/page editors to pass a parameter
throught $_REQUEST to the next hook - "save_post" and 'publish_post'.  It
works for writing post, but does not work for writing page.  See below for
code sections.  Does page_edit_form work the same way as the hooks for post
edit forms?

Is there a better way to pass custom parameters from edit page to save_post
hook function?

function w2x_pass_request_params(){
    $w2x_type = $_REQUEST['w2x'];
    $out = '<input type="hidden" name="w2x" value="' . $w2x_type . '"  />';
    echo $out;
}
add_action('simple_edit_form', 'w2x_pass_request_params');
add_action('edit_form_advanced', 'w2x_pass_request_params');
add_action('edit_page_form', 'w2x_pass_request_params');


function post2RDF($id){
    $w2x_type = $_REQUEST['w2x'];   // this parameter is not set when
edit_page_form hook is used!
}
add_action('publish_post', 'post2RDF');
add_action('save_post', 'post2RDF');

Most response splitting writeups I've seen recommend stripping the CR 
and LF entities.

I think we can whitelist since wp_redirect() is limited to admin URIs. 
I don't think it needs to be able to handle arbitrary URLs or encoded i18n.

Not so: Admin URLs contain the names of plugins, which aren?t always
judiciously named.

Don't forget the many accessibility issues AJAX has.

There's more to "graceful degradation" than making it work without
Javascript. There are many clients in popular use on the web that
understand Javascript, will update a DOM element after page-load, and
which *do not inform the user that that particular element has
altered*. So whilst it works correctly, it appears to the user as if
nothing's happened.

One example of such a client is a screenreader, which parses JS quite
well, and doesn't watch for updated elements. So if you have a link,
or a submit button, and your screenreader user clicks it, chances are
they won't notice the change.

Similarly expand/contract hide/show DOM scripting; passes by.

No way around this.

Now, if your target audience is narrow, then you can probably get away
with this. Alternatively, if your application is so reliant on JS -
for instance, the Google Apps - yeah, you can get away with it. But a
great many developers shouldn't be walling off potential client-base
because of their choice of client.

Just a quick reminder ;)

I hadn't touched the new Widgets/Sidebar combo until two days ago, but
I'd completely agree that (IMHO) would be an excellent way of dealing
with the Write page.

On one condition: better AJAX - the widgets' AJAX is very incompatible and buggy!

Better Javascript you mean? AFAIT, there is no AJAX on the Widgets page.
