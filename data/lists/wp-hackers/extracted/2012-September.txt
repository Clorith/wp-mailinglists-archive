Every theme must be made correctly so it will play with different wordpress
plugin and features, specifically multisite well. To answer your question,
yes it is possible, just create a new subdomain under your host and point
it to your directory where your new wordpress resides. Thanks

I am experiencing a problem/issue that I believe should be fixable, and
all of my research has led me to reach out to this list. Please forgive me
if I am in error.

Setup - WP 3.4.1 with no plugins installed running 2011 theme

Process - embedding Dreamweaver CS4 FLV code via embedit plugin onto
multiple pages/posts on blog.

Problem - FLV plays fine on main page (index). No videos will play on any
other pages.

Attempts to fix -

Built individual directories including all necessary files, changed paths
to point and nothing would play on secondary pages (anything other than
index)

Put all files in root and adjusted paths.

Used non plugin embed (straight copy and paste inside editor)method -
worked again, on page 1 but no other

Interesting developments -

Am able to play videos on static HTML pages.
Videos will not play on alternate pages even with identical code.
FLV is not the vendor of anything I am using. This is all dreamweaver
code, automatically generated.

-----

If this sounds like something you have come across, can identify, or
otherwise can assist me with, please reply to this message and I will
supply links to the pages. I have excluded them here ONLY because the size
of this list makes for prohibitive bandwidth usage. I don't imagine
everyone on this list will be interested in this issue.

Again, thank you for your time reading, and I hope one of you can assist
with this problem. And if again, I have erred in sending this I apologize.

Without offering up an example of the code you're using, it's almost
impossible for others to suggest a solution.

That being said, the problem will definately be down to file paths (If
you're using pretty permalinks)

For example, on the index page 'video.flv' will refer to '
http://example.com/video.flv' whilst, on a post page, it might refer to '
http://example.com/post-name/video.flv' <-- obviously the wrong path.

I completely understand. I didn't want to expend an unneccsary amount of
bandwidth if no one was interested...just having some tire
kickers.....lol. Sorry.
here ya go...

The URL is http://conversionassistant.com
The secondary URL is
conversionassistant.com/talent-sign-up-here-to-be-a-conversion-assistant/

The issue became more interesting today, in that the working version was
setup using 'static front page'. When I turned that off to test, NO videos
would play. Once I turned it back on, they played agian.

In fact, when the Latest Posts was set, all of the embedded code had been
removed.

Thank you for your time on this....

Is there a way I can hook into the import/parser to import an XML file
stored locally (to the WordPress install), rather than having to manually
upload a remote file?

I would like to use this for:
1. Creating default sets of data via the admin screen.
2. Creating default sets of data on network site creation.

The main purpose of this is to create a demo site (that gets deleted and
rebuilt regularly).

There is no WP_Query parameter that will do what you want, so your only
option is probably to use the posts_from and posts_where filters to add in
custom SQL.

Users' roles are stored in the wp_usermeta table of the database as a
serialzed array of all their roles and/or individual capabilities. This
means you will almost definitely NOT want to access them directly. Instead
I propose that what you'd want to do is generate an array with all users in
a given role, then in the posts_where filter add a clause that fetches
posts from any of the authors from that array.

Not a simple solution but your problem is fairly unique. User roles are
intended for use in controlling access permissions rather than for marking
content sections of your site (though your issue points out how such a
'content groups' need often comes up).

wp-cli has an import DB command using .sql

Make the DB, save it once, run the 'wp db drop' and then a 'wp db 
create' or whatever.

Subject: [wp-hackers] preventing new tags from being entered.
Message-ID: <CAHERW=1q-VaXp0zvBGQPr2_UEtwiRFjcWxoH5LRz33aT9KA0pg@mail.gmail.com>

I want a controlled tag vocabulary. And I want only editors and admins
to be able to control/add new tags. This is because my tag cloud
covers enough words/subjects ( 5000 of them! ) and they are all hand
picked and ready to use with proper spellings and abbreviations. And I
do not want my data entry people to add new tags on the fly.

I did some reading on this on WP forums. To solve this problem, some
people suggest to remove the add new tag button. But that suggestion
is not helpful cause it takes the textbox with it too. Since I want my
data entry people to take advantage of the type-ahead functionality
that WordpPress comes with, I'd like to keep the front end as is. That
is, they can still type in the first 3 characters of the subject
matter and pick one from the suggestions by simply hitting enter.

I don't think it is possible prevent a user to add a new tag at the
client/browser/javascript level. jQuery cannot stop that action from
taking place. However, this issue should easily be addressed at the
server level - when the actual post creation or update takes place.

The idea is this;

If the current user is not an editor or an admin, ignore the new
tag(s) completely. And execute the action as if that tag was not part
of the submission. And after the save or update is completed, warn the
user with a JS alert that some tag(s) were ignored. I'm assuming at
some point, WP does a look up if tag exists, and if not create the new
tag, get the newly created tag id and the use that in associating the
post. It should fairly simple to exit out carrying the action all the
way if WP detects, the tag is new and the user is not an admin/editor.

In order to pull this off, could someone guide me what hooks do I need
to use? Or suggest ideas if this is good way to approach the matter or
not?

Remove the metabox, make your own replacement that only allows selection,
and hide the admin screen (/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=post_tag) from
non-editors/admins. Can also only do the metabox switching for
non-editors/admins.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Category permalinks issue
Message-ID: <85F5FA8B-A03A-4D2A-8B53-0E44B5CA5692@getmoxied.net>

Hi,
I'm having the issue with category permalink and pagination as well.

1. My problem is that wordpress generates category permalink in wrong way:
I'm getting http://example.com/categoryname instead of http://example.com/category/categoryname.
Does anyone familiar with issue like that ? 

2. Pagination doesnt works as well: 

Permalink looks fine: http://example.com/videos/page/2/ but when i'm trying to access it i'm getting 404 page.


Thank you in advance,
Dmitry

WordPress never generates category links like that.

The likelihood is that you have a plugin (or possibly a theme) making that
change. Some SEO plugins will remove he category prefix.

Try disabling your plugins one by one and testing to see whether it fixes
things. If the plugin is particularly badly behaved you may need to save
the permalink settings after de-activating each plugin.

Also, double check your Settings > Permalinks page. There should be an input field for the Category and Tag Base.

Why not to export the ?final data" in database, than backup the database.
After that, every time you want to restore it, restore the whole
database(perhaps within cron)

Subject: [wp-hackers] class Attribute for iFrame Tag in TinyMCE
Message-ID: <CAH9UVvF1o0vS59OcQBVFLCkg3DzVHumY9Dphv3ANVtiBCVAJjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello at all.
I have allowed the iframe tag for the editor via follow source, see
below. But the class attribute is in the current stable and nightly
build not possible, always was killed.
Maybe is this an bug or an feature? Give it an filter for deactivate
the functinos, that remove all class attributes after an switch from
html to visual mode.
Thanks for your time and help!

add_filter( 'tiny_mce_before_init', 'fb_change_mce_options' );
function fb_change_mce_options( $arr ) {
	
	// Comma separated string od extendes tags
	// Command separated string of extended elements
	$ext = 'iframe[id|class|title|style|align|frameborder|height|longdesc|marginheight|marginwidth|name|scrolling|src|width]';
	
	if ( isset( $arr['extended_valid_elements'] ) )
		$arr['extended_valid_elements'] .= ',' . $ext;
	else
		$arr['extended_valid_elements'] = $ext;

	var_dump( $GLOBALS['allowedposttags'] );
	
	var_dump($arr);
	
	return $arr;
}

i have check the allowedposttags var. This var don't have the new tag
iframe after my additional. But also an enhancement of this var have
no results for the class attribute. With other attributes works fine,
like frameborder.

	$GLOBALS['allowedposttags']['iframe'] = array(
			"id" => TRUE,
			"class" => array(),
			"title" => TRUE,
			"style" => TRUE,
			"align" => TRUE,
			"frameborder" => TRUE,
			"longdesc" => TRUE,
			"marginheight" => TRUE,
			"marginwidth" => TRUE,
			"name" => TRUE,
			"scrolling" => TRUE,
			"src" => TRUE,
			"height" => TRUE,
			"width" => TRUE
	);

Best regards
frank

You should check first who block it. If it the js wysiwyg engine or the php
parser..
Also, give it a try within the tinymce official demo(by their website).

Hi Helen
Could you tell me the hooks/filters involved to make a change in the tag meta box?
Thank you

And also wouldn't it be easier to Judy ignore the new tags at the time of update?

This is a bit of code I have lying around for replacing taxonomy metaboxes
with a select-only interface using Chosen (
http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/) as a multiselect helper:
https://gist.github.com/1573966

The relevant hook is basically just add_meta_boxes, or
add_meta_boxes_{$post_type}, so you can remove the metabox and then add
your own. Because you have many tags, I would probably suggest creating a
replacement that does autocomplete rather than loading all of the terms on
page load. If you name the field correctly ($tax_input[$tax_name]), saving
will take care of itself.

That's a pretty terrible user experience, especially given the default tag
metabox. "Here, I'll let you enter tags arbitrarily, but some of them might
not get used, and you won't know which ones!" In reality, you will want to
check capabilities on save in case data is manipulated, so you will want to
ignore new tags on update anyway. But just because it works behind the
scenes doesn't mean that you shouldn't also account for the actual user.
You still have to account for the actual tag/taxonomy admin screen as well.

I don't really want to drop and restore the whole database. And I'd prefer
to do it from inside WordPress rather than 'escaping out' to shell (whether
via PHP, cron, CLI).

WordPress already has an XML export/import process that takes care of issue
of database table prefixes, taxonomy and post relationships. I can create
an XML dump of a set of data ('my albums') and import that into whatever
installations wherever I like, without destroying current data. I'm just
forced to do it by file upload.

I was hoping that I could (for example)
a) Place that XML file in a plugin and import it at the press of a button
b) Skip the confirmation step with pre-made decisions (e.g. always set
author to admin)

Am I being too whacky?

Sorry, I missed this, arrived after my previous reply for some reason.
Looks pretty close to what I'm after; extending WP_Import, user mapping
definable. :)

I understand your point Helen. With all due respect though, I still
believe that ignoring the new tags at the server side is a better and
more native approach when you work with a trained group of people.
When you work with a closed circle of people which you can teach what
to do and what not to do, the problem you are rightly referring to
becomes a non-issue. I see it as  saying "enter a valid name" in a
form field and then firing back from the server side to tell the user
"we did not take your name because it contained numbers in it".

I will use your suggestion if I fail to achieve my goal by ignoring
the new tags at save/update time. But what is the hook that i need to
tap into to pull this off?

Again, my goal is to allow the front end of the dashboard work exactly
the same way as it behaves but thru this plugin/action hook, simply
ignore the new tags and return back with a script alert that this
taxonomy is locked for new tags and therefore, new tags have been
ignored.

I think this is a great example of where the 1 to 1 relationship of WP > User is not as flexible for today's market as it could be.The binary segmentation of Logged in / Logged out works for blogs, but as soon as you move away from that you start to hit issues.bbPress and buddyPress are great examples.

Just my two cents.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Permalinks,
	Custom Post Types & Canonical 301 Redirects...
Message-ID: <2DD698C2A6F8024D92C5823EAE54455F9D361E@IRVMBX1.dgs.dgsystems.com>

I think I found a bug in WP Core wrt permalinks and custom post types.  If I go into Admin > Settings > Permalinks and change the structure from Post Name to Numeric, all of the rewrite rules are updated with /archives prepended to the rule except for the rules for Custom Post Types.  They are stored in $extra_permastructs of the WP_Rewrite class.  They are initialized on class load to an empty array, and populated with the permalinks specified by the CPT logic when they are loaded with register_post_type().  But those events occur before the update permalink logic in options-permalink.php (near line 86)

And flush_rewrite_rules() doesn't actually re-initialize those CTP permalink rules, it only flushes wp core rewrite rules pertaining to pages posts feeds and the like.  WP_Rewrite simply re-uses the CPT rules as they were loaded on the page post to options-permalink.php.  Which of course means it will use the old version of the rewrite template because it had yet to be updated.

The same issue occurs if you switch back to "Post Name" for the url structure.  Everything updates to use /post_name/ except for custom post types which now contain "archives" in front of the permalink structure.

Clicking save twice after changing the setting will update pages and posts in addition to custom post types.  And I've seen suggestions from Andrew Nacin and others in various other posts to "click save once or twice just to be sure"  when other people have had similar yet different problems, as seen in these top google results:

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/permalinks-go-404-on-custom-post-types?replies=7#post-2301522
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-custom-post-type-permalinks-all-custom-post-type-pages-and-categories-result-in-404s?replies=12#post-2841550
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/40591/10127
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/custom-post-type-permalink-rewrite?replies=10

What's crazy is that until the permalinks are "fixed" canonical.php takes over and does 301 redirects for those links that cannot find Custom Post Type content because of the invalid/old rewrite rules.  Whereas if the permalinks are updated twice in a row, redirect_canonical() never has to execute.

I know making "Save Permalinks" execute itself twice in a row would solve the problem (perhaps an ajax request would be better suited than a page post.)  - But that that's as hacky as relying on 301 redirects to correct outdated permalinks because they were loaded too early in the call stack.  Can I reload plugins after already loading them once?  Then we could clear the $extra_permastructs array along with other structures in the init() function, and reload them with the updated $front value.

Obviously this is some deep core stuff, and I'm trying to summarize about 1500 lines of code into a couple paragraphs but is anyone able to shed some light on this problem?  Or at least confirm that it's a problem and that I'm on the right track?

Thanks,
Marcus

I think the initial idea is performance wise, MySQL is notorious with the
lack of ability of an adequate JOIN work so that's the reason everything in
WP to be persisted in a single table wherever possible. Extra JOIN
statements on a large blog with 6-7 digits of posts and hundred Ks users
would lead to dramatic results.

Which doesn't exclude the fact that in a real project with users this
generates problems.

Message-ID: <CAFCSB_JdPNNr19rV1xrjB+J3kXPfCQxCmrdc1V8sd5uLkJcLwA@mail.gmail.com>

Awhile ago I read this article online about how to use domains with
WordPress Multisite without a plugin. From what I remember from it it was a
manual method where you edited database settings for the site.

Now for a little background this is my understanding of the existing domain
mapping plugin. If Multisite is setup at example.com and I create a site at
coolblog.example.com or example.com/coolblog then I register coolblog.com.
I redirect the old site example.com/coolblog to coolblog.com and it fixes
all the links inside the site to point to coolblog.com. The problem is
example.com/coolblog still exists as a redirect.

The method described in the article bypassed this completely for
example.com/cool blog does not exist. I want to do it that way so
coolblog.com and example.com/coolblog can coexist as separate sites if
necessary.

Here's my problem I cannot seem to find that article anymore, i know my
fault for not saving it. I was wondering if anyone who has more knowledge
how wordpress does domain mapping can explain how to get this kind of setup.

Hey everyone,

I'm going to be doing a presentation at WordCamp Philly in a month on
development application workflow - I'll be running through applications and
featuresets and live demos. I'm not sure exactly how much I'm going to get
to cover within the time limit, but the topics will include code
editors/IDEs, version control, FTP, and some command line.

Please reply with a rant about your application workflow and why it rules,
whether directly to me or to this email. I'm probably not going to have a
chance to review everyone's input immediately but would love as much as
possible.

Thanks in advance!

For me I use GIT, mainly for easy branching. I then push my local GIT repo
to a hosted one with beanstalk and I have a great setup when I push my
Staging branch to beanstalk i use a webhook which gets the details then
that script  with use rackspace cloud APIs to spin up a cloud server, and
then configure beanstalk to deploy to the newly setup server. When I push
to production a webhook with delete my staging server with rackspace then
use beanstalk to deploy the code to my production server,

Sure its a bit complex but you can use a more simplified deployment with
beanstalk fairly easily. I just use webhooks to provision and delete my
staging server to save money. But i suppose if you have a local machine you
can use for staging or something you could just as easily skip the step.

Thanks @scribu, I'm sad to find out that this problem was confirmed and that an associated ticket in trac has a patch that will fix this problem and another problem, but it has gone unpatched for 4 years :(

But thanks for following up... I thought maybe the list server crashed - two full days of no discussions??? Weird.

I am setup for Windows dev work. So I use XAMPP's Apache and MySQL 
(defaulted to myisam) running locally out of a DropBox folder.  I shut 
down the servers any time I might be switching from desktop to laptop to 
prevent collisions.  It's a bit of awesome just be able to just turn on 
the laptop and have your host file, httpd.conf&vhosts.conf and mysql 
databases just work for your local dev environment.  The mklink windows 
command and DropBox allows for wonderful things like portable hosts 
files (and Terraria characters).

If I need to cowboy code, I use ExpanDrive to access the server 
(version1.8.4 is faster for SSH but I will use the new version for FTP 
only servers) as a drive letter.  So I have a number of standard drives 
for customers which I need to access often.

Because I have a drive letter assigned, I can just use Notepad++ to 
access the local and/or remote code.  I have it set up with function 
keys that access the codex for WordPress functions.

Dropbox along with the Windows 7 task scheduler is also nice for 
scheduled exports and imports of Putty registry settings. So if I add a 
client to putty, it will just appear on my other machines the next day.  
I need to reconnect the ppks unfortunately. I've not dug into why that 
is not working.

The one other unique thing about my environment is that I use Ztree as a 
file manager because it does SOOO much more than explorer and does it 
more quickly in most cases. http://www.ztree.com/ (OK I need to redo 
their website for them. That's embarrassing. :) ) But it's a great 64bit 
windows tool.

I do the same thing, but instead of using mklink to create links to various
folders/files, I throw everything to my Dropbox folder! XAMPP is about 60
MB + WP source + Database is about 200 MB, that's not a problem with
Dropbox. And while using this trick, I can develop WP everywhere.

Message-ID: <5051C761.5070905@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm currently including jQuery into a custom TinyMCE plugin by referring
to the wp-includes/js/jquery.js path

This path is hardcoded and looks like:

<script type="text/javascript"
src="../../../../../../wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js"></script>

I would prefer a method a bit more future proof.

Any hints on how you guys include jQuery in a TinyMCE plugin which
displays a popup (similar to WordPress' Links popup).

Thanks,

Message-ID: <1CEB0F4034E9462C93A3939AB22CF52A@seodavelt>


Looking for a plugin or code to allow users to search comments.

Yes, there are a handful of plugins that search within comments, but the results link to the original post and not directly to the comment. Which means if you have a well commented site the current plugins are practically useless.

Ideally if a user searched for a keyword all posts, pages and individual comments would be listed, so there could be 10 comments from the same post with links directly to those comments.

Anyone stumbled over code that?s close to this?

You could use Mark Jaquith's fragment caching
(https://gist.github.com/2653957)

Then you could do something like this on single for example:

if ( !current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) )
	$single_standard = new CWS_Fragment_Cache( 'single-standard-' .
$post->ID, 300 );

/// other code follows

So that caches for everyone except admins

This MAY help.. depending on what you're wanting to do exactly

The main reason for this is that things like the commenting section has 
user specific information in it when people are logged in.

If you have designed your site to avoid that, you can certainly can build

If you had a plugin that wrote a value out to the cookie for users who 
should not be cached, you could do it with a quick modification of
https://github.com/brianlayman/WordPress-DirtyMC

Just change the !issset check in
https://github.com/brianlayman/WordPress-DirtyMC/blob/master/index.php
to look for  $_COOKIE['do_not_cache_user'] )
or something.

You may not want to use that particular code though as it replaces 
index.php. So it's sort-of a core hack. That's why it's a dirty 
memcache. It's up to you though. You might find the speed increase worth it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress TinyMCE plugin: preferred method for
 including jQuery
In-Reply-To: <mailman.9.1347537602.32361.wp-hackers@lists.automattic.com>

I did it this way:

1. wp_register_script('myscript', SCRIPT_LOCATION, array('jquery') ) 
//register my script with dependency on jquery
2. in my tmce plugin instead of <script></script> I do <?php 
wp_print_scripts('myscript'); ?> which loads my script and also jquery 
before it..

Hope that helps..

Hello,

On a vanilla Wordpress site the code at the bottom of this post works fine.?

$published_posts?always equals?$query->found_posts

On a site with many plugins?$published_posts?is correct and nonzero but
$query->found_posts?is always zero and no posts are ever returned.

Does anyone have any tips for troubleshooting this type of problem? Is
it likely that a plugin is clobbering something?


?php
$count_posts = wp_count_posts();
$published_posts = $count_posts->publish;
?>

<?php $query = new WP_Query( 'post_status=publish' ); ?>
<?php print "Blog posts: $query->found_posts"; ?><br>
<?php print "Published posts: $published_posts"; ?><br>

Thanks,

Kevin?

Chris,

Thanks for the reply. Some more detail: the site only has 8 published posts.?


The codex says:

? ?Get the Publish Status Post Count
? ?To get the published status type, you would call the?wp_count_posts()?function and then access the 'publish'?property.
? ?<?php?
? ? ? ?$count_posts = wp_count_posts();?
? ? ? ?$published_posts = $count_posts->publish;?
? ??>?

So there are only 8 published posts. $published_posts is 8 but the WP_Query below is not returning any results:
$query->found_posts = 0

Any idea how that could happen?

?php
$count_posts = wp_count_posts();
$published_posts = $count_posts->publish; ?>

<?php $query = new WP_Query( 'post_status=publish' ); ?>?
<?php print "Blog?posts: $query->found_posts"; ?><br>?
<?php print "Published posts:?$published_posts"; ?><br>

Thanks a lot,

Kevin

Hi All,

I am new to WordPress development and would like to get some feedback from
the development community on my first plugin before I continue to work on
it.

The plugin is called WP_OOPlugin, I am still trying to think of a more
appropriate name, it can be found on GitHub here
https://github.com/dotDeeka/WP_OOPlugin .

Basically my idea was to provide a way to make it easier for plugin authors
to write their plugins. You would install WP_OOPlugin and if you follow
it's convention and extend its classes when defining your own plugin
classes then WP_OOPlugin's classes will handle some stuff for you while
allowing you to override it's default functionality if necessary. More
detail can be found in the readme in the GitHub repository (The readme file
has a lot more info than is here, but is still a work in progress).

I'd like to get any feedback or opinion on this you guys might have. I
don't want to waste time working on this if there is some reason why the
community wouldn't like it or it would go against any WordPress specific
principles.

Like I said I'm new to WordPress and this is my first time e-mailing
wp-hackers so please be gentle if my ideas are way off the mark.

Thanks,
Derek

Hello Derek,

You're not writing a plugin; you're writing a plugin framework. Developing
a framework just as you're getting familiar with WordPress development is
not a good idea in general, since you don't really have enough experience
to know which things are actually useful to have in a framework and which
you'll seldom need.

There are no WordPress principles against object-oriented programming or
agains frameworks. Here's a bunch of them I know about:

I would argue that any advanced development undertaking will only give you
that experience and help you get further. Derek isn't putting this on the
market or selling it so I'm not sure shutting things down makes sense
simply because of a lack of experience. The idea of a MVC plugin Framework
may not be appealing to web devs but may spark greater interest in WP
development from Computer Science Programmers.

Just a side note a couple dead links under the settings framework.

NHP options framework is also a good one ;)

You can certainly get more experienced at developing frameworks by
developing a framework. And you will also gain general development
experience. I'm talking about experience in building apps, i.e. themes or
plugins.

I will not comment any further as I don't really know anything about Derek,
except that he's new to WordPress.

Thank you guys for the feed back so far.

Scribu,
I think I should clarify my question a little. I wasn't really asking if I
should be writing the plugin because of my lack of experience, I
acknowledge that I have a lot to learn about WordPress development that is
why I am e-mailing this list.

You saying I do not have enough experience to know what would be useful in
a plugin framework is absolutely true. I am just making assumptions about
what I do know about WordPress development combined with my knowledge of
other CMSs and application frameworks to make an educated guess about what
I think could be helpful. The reason I turn to this e-mail list is because
you guys are the ones that can validate or discredit my assumptions.

I was hoping to spark a conversation about weather the things I have
included in the plugin so far would be helpful.

Also, thanks for the list of the other plugin frameworks out there I will
go through them. I am interested to see if any of them had similar ideas as
myself.

Ok, some actual feedback:

The problem with this:

    function action_admin_init__perform_setup_tasks(){
        // perform some additional setup tasks on admin_init
    }


is: how do you set the hook priority and the number of parameters the
method accepts?

Also, how do you allow other plugins to unhook it?

The latter is best taken by looking at the function itself. I personally
think having PHPDoc tags is much better than including it in the name,
so the aforementioned Rotor_WPPlugin classes map:

	/**
	 * @wp-action admin_init 10
	 * @wp-filter init 5
	 */
	function abc($a, $b) { }

to:

	add_action('admin_init', 'abc', 10, 2);
	add_filter('init', 'abc', 5, 2);


The only caveat with PHPDoc is that eAccelerator has an insane
configuration mode which strips PHPDoc blocks, despite them being
completely different to comments, and part of the code. For that reason,
it also has the ability to use similar naming to this, but with a
customisable prefix; this mode maps "action_init" -> add_action('init',
...); with the "action_" part customisable.

I use that class in quite a few of my plugins since it's quick and
effective. Even in projects where I don't, I still use the @wp-action
and @wp-filter tags, since it saves having to look up how it's being
hooked every time, and it also makes it much easier to search.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_update_posts fails
Message-ID: <CAHERW=0RDmdwK1HB3WSLQudWQNJs6tKVn5RqPx2O8bA7f-RtYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, when I use the wp_update_post, from time to time I get a $post_id
0 indication of an error.

That's all due to the $post_content string containing some invalid
code, ( invalid as far as WP is concerned I guess ).

Anyway, I printed out the error; the error is

Incorrect string value: '\x92s own...' for column 'post_content' at row 1

I get the error thru

global $wpdb;
echo $wpdb->last_error;

And that's right after me detecting the wp_update_post returns 0.

how do you tackle such import problems  so that $content does not fail
the process like that!
Is there a way to clean the $content so that it becomes kosher enough
for the wp_update_post to go thru?

Content is all English. The culprit characters are those introduced by
our friends at Microsoft like the "stupid smart quotes" etc.
Since they may not be limited to smart-quotes, what universal solution
would you adopt?

Go thru the $content char by char and skip the ones that are not in
the proper ASCII range?

Message-ID: <CAPpJHbDyg1a7=KjE4zGucCWoudUtEe4WptepvOep_5dZ4GEdUA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear wp-hackers,

I'm going through the WP code line-by-line as part of a new project and
have come across the code for the prepare function in wp-db.php.  This
function
can take a variable number of arguments (up to 3 according to the comments
and usages).  However, I think there is an issue with the 3rd argument,
when present, being over-written by the code.  The prepare() code is

//////
function prepare( $query = null ) { // ( $query, *$args )
        if ( is_null( $query ) )
            return;

        $args = func_get_args();
        array_shift( $args );
        // If args were passed as an array (as in vsprintf), move them up
        if ( isset( $args[0] ) && is_array($args[0]) )
            $args = $args[0]; // QUESTION
        $query = str_replace( "'%s'", '%s', $query ); // in case someone
mistakenly already singlequoted it
        $query = str_replace( '"%s"', '%s', $query ); // doublequote
unquoting
        $query = preg_replace( '|(?<!%)%s|', "'%s'", $query ); // quote the
strings, avoiding escaped strings like %%s
        array_walk( $args, array( &$this, 'escape_by_ref' ) );
        return @vsprintf( $query, $args );
    }
//////

The issue lies with the line I've commented with 'QUESTION'.  This
overwrites the arg array obtained from func_get_args() with the second
argument (after the first was popped from the array) - hence the 3rd arg is
lost.  Have I missed something / is this intended behaviour / is this a bug?

Thanks for reading my first post to this list!

Regards

Simon Courtenage

You could either pass a list of arguments to prepare(...) as single
variables or a single array with all values, the purpose of that line is to
unify the behavior for both approaches.

As the comment above it explains, no, it's not a bug.

The first element is poped off as it's the $query variable passed in, thats
not needed.

The then first element is expanded if it contains the data, Eg, the
following 2 lines are identical in result:
$wpdb->prepare( "...", 'A String', 42 );
$wpdb->prepare( "...", array( 'A String', 42 ) );

As a result of this, the following is not a valid way to call prepare:
$wpdb->prepare( "...", array( 'A String', 42 ), "another variable" );

Subject: [wp-hackers] Measuring "distance" between two web pages
Message-ID: <50585C6A.7060201@wordshell.net>

Hi,

This is a more general question than specifically WordPress, but perhaps 
someone will have an idea.

With WordShell (wordshell.net) we've got customers who manage enormous 
numbers of sites (mass hosting). They can't be bothered or can't afford 
to test each one individually after doing an update from 3.4.1 to 3.4.2.

WordShell presently visits the site home-page before and after 
alterations, to test for HTTP errors. But that's rather basic.

What I'd be interested in is if anyone knows of any tool or method for a 
generalised way of producing a score for a difference between two HTML 
pages. i.e. I download the HTML before, and again after - are they 
"probably" the same page? They can't be expected to be exactly the same; 
for one thing, the "Generator" meta tag will have changed. The page 
might show the present time, or have hidden timings in the HTML source, etc.

So, what I'm interested in is a way to produce a "distance" score 
between the two pages. Something so that we can say something like "if 
the difference is more than X, then there is a Y% chance that these are 
not the same page". By choosing for Y, I can then test on X. Then 
WordShell will put up a flag based on that statistical likelihood - "OY! 
There's a good chance that that update broke the page!".

This is quite interesting not just for maintaining WordPress but for any 
website, but I haven't come across anything like it - any ideas?

Many thanks,
David

Add up all the numerical values of all the characters. It's as likely to
work as anything. This will, of course, fail badly under some
circumstances (a single character in the CSS can change things *a lot*),
but will work under others. 

Another way would be to render the HTML to an image, then compare the
images. There are lots of off the shelf things to do this (for instance,
"compare" from ImageMagick). This would check the visualisation. Setting
a sane threshold might be hard, but who knows till you try it. 

Otherwise, I think you are asking about automated robot checking which
is going to get hard. 

Phil

There are a couple of php functions for this exact thing, mainly the
levenshtein <http://php.net/manual/en/function.levenshtein.php> and
similar-text <http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.similar-text.php>
 functions.

I have tried in the past to use them for something similar when i was
building something along these lines and it's absolutley possible.

There are a bunch of limitations however on how the long the strings can be
and stuff like that so it might not be optimal.

There's a plugin for an academic work in machine learning that can do
posts auto-classification based on words, verbs and pronouns
histograms.
https://bitbucket.org/viniciusmassuchetto/bcc-ufpr/src/94d8da2661ec/ci310-tam/trabfinal/self-classifier

Also, the paper (in Portuguese) describes the math expression for
calculating the distance between two posts:
https://bitbucket.org/viniciusmassuchetto/bcc-ufpr/src/94d8da2661ec/ci310-tam/trabfinal/doc/relatorio.pdf

You could easily extend it for HTML pages, giving a higher score to
matching tags.

Cheers.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Checking for a duplicated post while using XML-RPC
	WordPress API
Message-ID: <CA+fCkBueFDqh5djM-NnrzC4ZP80hoqHDZYfiXYsP=-8WZ0VmHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to come up with the solution to check for a duplicated post
entry through XML-RPC WP API (
http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_WordPress_API/Posts#wp.newPost )

I use it to insert posts in the blog automatically while getting the
external content from the feeds or other databases. The problem is there
seem to be no easy or elegant way to check for a duplicated entry unless I
first get all the posts and check for a duplicated title / description /
meta key.

I was wondering if anyone came up with a more robust solution to do it.
The ideal way would be to have it handled by the database structure
checking for duplicated entries. It seems it was never an issue since
Wordpress is originally meant for manual entries of each post.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Regards,
Alex

When migrating a huge site to Disqus I ended up using the command-line tool
xmllint* to track down all the strange little encoding failures in the WXR
file created by WP that Disqus was choking on. If you're using XML at all
that might help. It was the only thing I could find that was sensitive
enough to pick up all the issues that would cause Disqus to fail.

Not sure if that helps you at all. There may be other tools that will have
a similar effect of scrubbing whatever kind of data you have that you are
importing to WP.

Thank you Jeremy for sharing your experience.

What I find confusing is the following;
If I use the dashboard interface to update a post with the smart
characters ( the same ones that causes my migration routine chokes on
), that post goes thru. What's it that makes it work at the dashboard
when the post is done manually, and what is that fails it when the
same content is updated using the WP API?

One solution I will try today is to save the content as a text file
and then read the text file back - hoping this save and read operation
scrubs the characters that wp_update_post is choking on.

This char set matters always get to me.

Wp update post requires that the data you feed it is run through
addslashes(), are you doing so here?

Having chewed this over, I wonder if an even simpler solution is best. 
Just do a total character count.

A web-page may have rolling content that changes from one view to the 
next. But the total amount of content is likely to stay similar. If a 
page of 60,000 characters in the source turns into a page of 20,000 
after updating a plugin, then something probably went wrong.

Quick-and-dirty test:

# for i in google.com news.bbc.co.uk/sport wordpress.org/extend/plugins 
wordshell.net facebook.com slashdot.org cart66.com planet.wordpress.org; 
do echo "$i: `wget -q -O - http://$i | wc -c` `wget -q -O - http://$i | 
wc -c`"; done

google.com: 11126 11090
news.bbc.co.uk/sport: 142052 142052
wordpress.org/extend/plugins: 18981 18981

slashdot.org: 100756 100756
cart66.com: 27632 27631
planet.wordpress.org: 58082 58088

Testing on the approx. sixty sites I've got in a particular WordShell 
installation:

# for i in `wordshell --listsites | grep Enabled | awk '{print $6}'`; do 
echo -n "`wget -q -O - http://$i | wc -c`/`wget -q -O - http://$i | wc 
-c`, "; done

Of course, that's not pre/post upgrade (and of course too some of those 
sites are running caching plugins, so of course we get the same result), 
but it indicates that, at least on this sample of sites, you're not 
expecting the character count to vary much from one page view to the 
next. I think the max in there is 20 characters, or about 0.1%. Those 
counts also vary a lot from one site to another. So I think larger 
changes in character count before and after a change can be good 
predictors of breakage.

Het Alex,

There is no good way to do it currently except when you write your own XML-RPC method.
When inserting date through the XML-RPC the client needs to deal with this. That is to only good way of doing this.

This can't really be handled by the database structure because there isn't a default way of saying what is duplicated and what is not.

Message-ID: <CA+vutv6zN2QUHnARn8Q7BhN59d15uSwj3kqjK3kUzVjd7Etz_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I try to find a way to change the permalink structure for Wordpress pages.
Here why :
- I have a site heavily based on pages (rather than posts)
- I have activated permalinks
- By default page permalinks reproduce the breadcrumb to the page :
http://[domain]/[top
page slug]/[subpage 1 slug]/[subpage 2 slug]/[final subpage slug]
- This structure is fine. However, sometimes I move pages or slightly
modify the page tree
- It causes permalinks to change as page/subpages dependencies have changed
too
- That's a real SEO problem for me as I have to manage 301 redirections by
hand
- To simplify that, I woud like to have "real" permalinks, meaning
permalinks that don't change wherever the pages are positioned in the tree

We have looked in the code for hooks allowing us to manipulate page
permalinks but it seems that's not possible.

Did someone have a solution for this kind of problem ?

Thank you in advance for your help.

This is interesting because while pages have the "permalinks" feature,
and it would normally work as designed without any problems, it is
partially broken with the decision to use parent page slugs in the URL
for this reason.

There might be a plugin that disables parent page slugs in the URL,
though I haven't seen one that does it yet. In your case (having pages
already published under those URLs), any plugin that does this though
would break all your existing pages though, so you will likely just
have to deal with this.

This can quickly turn into a rather lengthy discussion debating which
behavior should be the default, and there's certainly good reasons for
both sides. On one side, it could be argued that permalinks are broken
(i.e. this is a bug) with parent page slugs being used. On the other
hand, many sites need that extra context for tons of pages that really
helps with SEO (when pages aren't moved). You could also argue that
the extra context can *still* be used without parent page slugs by
just adding it to your page slugs by hand.

What I think would be an awesome compromise would be to disable parent
page slugs, but re-adjust the page slug generator for new pages to
prefix the new page slug with the slugs of parent pages at the time
the page is created or published.

Bryan Petty

It still will be there if your blog is currently using it. In the end it will be a plugin what is a benefit if you are really using it right now.
Reason is that then there is a much easier way to add features to it. The better import/export will be a part of it since there is the idea to have it as a CPT.

To my understanding you can still use it.

add_filter( 'pre_option_link_manager_enabled', '__return_true' );

Martin,

Take a look at http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API#Plugins_API. It
should give you a place to start.

I think it should be a CPT, but is that what the plugin will be?!

You could use the `wp plugin status <plugin-name>` command from wp-cli:

That works to a degree, but when you're putting together a page like 
this or multiple pages, it's not really the place of CSS:
http://justintadlock.com/bookmarks/wordpress

Links are great for a ton of various things that can't be replicated 
with the menu system.  I don't mind them being in an external plugin 
though.  I've been wanting to move all my bookmarks over to a custom 
post type at some point anyway.

How about rolling out your own CPT? one with post-like capabilities so 
you get the custom permalinks.. then switch all your other WP Pages to 
the new CPT.

Just a thought.

I'm glad to see these in a plugin.  I've been using links extensively in some of my projects and they are indeed useful, but sadly overlooked.

Why not use a menu?

Links can be categorized, so if you use a lot of custom links  you can list them by category them and manage each URL in one place even though you use it in several lists.  This can be very helpful if a lot of your site is just lists of links to external resources (such as for an intranet or a reference site).

You can add a description and a custom image right from the interface, not needing to create a custom CSS class to add a menu image.

Menus are very useful for most of the stuff that people used links for, but they are not the same thing.

Anca.

Are you talking about...

a) Finding out about current WP directory plugin versions, by querying 
http://api.wordpress.org ?

b) Analysing an plugin file to see what version it is?


If b), then here's the regex I use in WordShell (it's a PCRE one, so 
will work from PHP or anything else that uses PCRE):
head -45 $PLUG | grep -Pi "^([ \t\*])*Version:\s?" | head -1 | cut -d: 
-f2- | sed 's/[^-0-9a-z\.]//gi


That's been developed through experience with testing on a few hundred 
plugins so should be fairly reliable. I've not compared it with what 
WordPress does internally (since it's worked reliably I've not needed to).

If a), then unfortunately the API is not well-documented, or easy to use 
from outside PHP since it uses PHP's serialisation format. There's not 
much you can do that I can see, except from reverse-engineering it by 
reading the WordPress source code and/or using tcpdump to do packet 
capture on a WordPress site.

I've been through that a bit, and WordShell has code to parse the API 
and display the description, changelog or download URL, e.g.:

# wordshell akismet --downloadurl
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/akismet.2.5.6.zip

It would be extremely easy for me to add in a switch to dump out the 
latest version, e.g.

# wordshell akismet --latestversion
2.5.6

Drop me a line off-list if you're interested.

I'm interested in "Finding out about current WP directory plugin
versions, by querying http://api.wordpress.org".

To query wordshell i need to know plugin slug - how i can get it?

For an installed plugin, the plugin slug equals the last component of 
the directory name (for wp-content/plugins/akismet, it is akismet).

For a not-yet-installed plugin, it equals the last part of the URL in 
the WP directory, e.g. for Updraft Plus, the URL is 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/updraftplus, and so the slug can be 
identified as updraftplus.

To get the plugin ver you can do something like this

    $url = 'http://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.0/wordpress-seo/';

    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
    $result = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);

    $result = unserialize($result);
    echo $result->version;

While that works, I cannot guarantee that it will continue to work in
the future. It's not the way the WordPress core itself uses to talk to
the API server.

You should be doing an HTTP POST to: http://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.0/

The parameters in the body of the POST for the plugin info request should be:
'action' = 'plugin_information'
and
'request' = PHP serialized version of array('slug'=>'whatever')

If you want to not get certain parts of the request (like all the
sections stuff from the readme), you can add an optional fields
parameter to that request array, like so:
array( 'slug'=>'whatever', 'fields' => array('sections' => false) )

That would make it not return the "sections" section in the response.

Thanks for the info on that what about the version for the update api?

Recently I was doing a check for the latest version from a shell script

curl -s http://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.6/ | sed -e
's/.*s:7:"current";s:5:"//;s/".*//'

which currently would print 3.4.2

does the version check allow post?

The core code uses a GET on that, actually. It's not as complex as the
plugin API is.

Not all users use default plugin install directory. So akismet can be  in
wp-content/plugins/akismet
wp-content/plugins/akism
wp-content/plugins/something_else/

Is there reliable info i can use to query the API?

No. The slug is the method by which the query works. Since the slug
normally comes from the search query and not from the directory name,
then that's how that works.

The directory name is reliable enough for most needs, since plugin
installs are built-in to WordPress. There are virtually no users
manually installing plugins and using their own directory names as
well.

I like links as CPT idea most because exporting will works. Menus just don't 
seems right, I mean...menu itens can't handle metadatas, images etc while 
cpt can handle all this already ?!

Sinan,
When you report that, please note what language your site uses and web host
you are running on? Those variables can affect if this is a bug or not.

Please note that on Trac. Then email the bug # to me directly and I'll test
to verify it.

(This list isn't the right place to document that extra info. Sorry to all

Hmm.  Why would you move away from a resource-oriented API using idempotent and HTTP-cacheable GET and towards an RPC-approach that uses HTTP POST if you are not trying to explicitly support a well-known interface like XMLRPC?  Minimally it makes consuming the API that much harder.

I've been following the API Craft Google group[1] recently and the API Evangelist blog[2] and they've got some really experienced web API developers on the list, and I'm pretty sure they would count moving from resource-oriented GET to an RPC-oriented POST as a major step backwards. Minimally moving in that direction means it won't be easy (possible?) to leverage some of the new and upcoming client and server tools for consuming, testing, monitoring, support and analyzing the API, things like what you can find here[3] and here[4].

I know you frequently dislike what many others view are best practices in selected areas but what's the benefit of this move away from HTTP GET? I can't see it.

Point of note: or the typical blogger that is true.  But professional site builders many choose to put selected plugins into the /mu-plugins directory and those plugins are only loaded if not in a subdirectory which means developers may choose to organize those plugins different than the default install would load them.  Just FYI.

I was just saying how the core does it. The core is most likely to do
it in a way that is actually supported. While other methods may also
work, if it's not how core is doing it, then it's not guaranteed to
work now, or in the future. No promises, basically.

Why would I move anything away from anything? Answer: I wouldn't. But
I'm not the person doing most of the API request coding, and I would
be hesitant in relying on something that isn't being used by the core
in the same way. Yes, it works. Is that by design or by chance? No way
to tell, huh? Best to not become dependent on an undocumented and
currently unused methodology. If you stick with what core is doing, it
has a much higher chance of continuing to work for the forseeable
future.

I agree with you with regard to methodologies, and the fact that so
many API calls both expect and produce serialized PHP makes me
terribly sad. But I didn't write them, and I'm not writing the core
code that uses them either.

No, it's not. Spaces are allowed in user names and work just fine for
author URLs, as the author URL actually uses the "nicename" field,
which is normalized to use dashes instead of spaces.

Message-ID: <CAO93KN+tpj4JYw-OmCJYB+tFyuqNZs+H5H+PhutVNzq5L1jmuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!


Here is my problem:

I'm reading json feed that contain image urls from direct server.

I'm looking for solution to download every image from that feed into my
wordpress library on my server and create a new post for every image and
set all image as attachments - one image per post.

I need to do it programmatically and check that feed for new images every
10 minutes (I will need cron for that I guess)


I wonder if anyone has experience with automatic image importing From
server to server...



Thank you in advance!

There are some functions in wp-admin/includes/file.php and media.php 
that you can use:

download_url() to download the file
media_handle_sideload() to add the file to media library

Then wp_insert_post to add a new post with wp_get_attachment_link() as 
the content.

The function you actually want to use is media_sideload_image(), which
does this all in one step.

So basically, create your normal post, then call
media_sideload_image() to download the image, create the attachment
post, and attach it to the parent post ID.

Thank you Bryan. I agree with you. Just to let you know that my developper
and I have checked the core's code and we've found that there is no hook to
manipulate page permalinks in it. I believe this is why there is no plugin
with such functionality (to my knowledge). Before an option, I would like
to have those hooks. With them, I will be fine with the current default
behavior.

Does anybody find one this hook in the current core's code ? (Just checking
if we're wrong.)

A good one actually :-) We thought to create one. However we are in the
process to entirely re-create the process to handle Wordpress native page
through a totally new plugin and we can't go with a CPT.

Sinan,

The function *get_author_posts_url()* (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_author_posts_url) may be
what you're looking for.

Erick Hitter Not work WP function thats the problem. Any way...

I fix it with this code if someone need...

<?php $nicknameuser =  get_the_author_meta('nickname',$user_ID);
 $nicknametireli = str_replace(" ","-",$nicknameuser); echo $nicknametireli;
?>

Subject: [wp-hackers] TwentyTen Divs Mix Up on NextPage usage
Message-ID: <0c6350d5-3ac7-463c-8d66-290d1b89c1e0@googlegroups.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to troubleshoot TwentyTen, actually a derivative theme based on 
some of the TwentyTen files.  Both have similar issues.  Essentially, when 
the <!--nextpage--> tag is used the first page of the post has it's DIVs 
mixed up.  Subsequent pages are fine and resemble those of a single page 
post.  Here's the difference in the DIV hierarchy:

*Page 1
*
wrapper
    header
    main
        container
            content
            primary
            secondary
        footer


*Page 2...n*

wrapper
    header
    main
        container
            content
        primary
        secondary
    footer

Has anyone seen this and/or worked through this?

Cheers,

Jeff

I have a question about wp_link_pages and hope someone can help. I see that
the link_before and link_after arguments are inserted before and after the
*text* of the links, and not before and after the actual link elements. How
would one go about inserting markup before and after each of the <a> tags?
Am I missing something?

Well, from a cursory glance at it, wp_link_pages has no way to do
that. Copy the function to a custom one, edit it to do what you want,
then use your new function instead.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Slow Loading Plugin Support Pages,
	Broken CrazyEgg JS link
Message-ID: <382BF49E-8BAB-4BBC-BB78-8D1C6C796E09@newclarity.net>

Hi all,

Recently I've noticed that plugin support pages are loading extremely slowly on wordpress.org and I just wanted to verify that the problem I'm seeing is indeed a problem and not somehow related to my computer's configuration.

To check go to any plugin support page, such as these:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/
http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/all-in-one-seo-pack 

Most of these support pages have been loading extremely slowly the past few days (not sure how it was before.)

Further, take a look at view source and you'll find this code:

<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
  document.write('<scr'+'ipt src="http://crazyegg.com/pages/scripts/23144.js?'+(new Date()).getTime()+'" type="text/javascript"></'+'script>');
//]]>
</script>

What it's trying to load from CrazyEgg is this Javascript file:

http://crazyegg.com/pages/scripts/23144.js

But that file returns "410 Gone"; maybe it's a broken analytics tracker? How I found out was I was iframing the support page and debugging resultant HTML and I keep keeping an error on that file. It took me awhile to realize it was a problem on wordpress.org and not a virus or errant browser extension.

Something to fix?

-Mike

Hi Marko!

Thanks a lot for reply! Yes, I figured I would need to either write my own
method or store a unique field as a meta tag value and then loop through
each post values for that meta key before inserting a new post.

Best regards,
Alex

Message-ID: <E3095566-A6F0-4C59-8577-26466E305D75@getmoxied.net>

I currently have a very strange issue happening with a site that we recently developed.  Basically what happens is when there is a fresh search on the site and the post that is returned for the search results has an image gallery (that we set up as shortcode using wp media library) the photo gallery is injected into the dom before the opening html tag and this is done using javascript.  As you can imagine this completely mangles the layout of the site.  Does anyone have any ideas on the issue or somehow that I can start debugging it?  I have listed step by step what happens below.

1. Do a search for "television"
2. I am returned a page with results for "television" with a photo gallery injected into the dom before the opening html tag via JS.
3. I refresh the page and it is gone.

**Note: the photo gallery is a custom post type which is inserted into posts with a shortcode- there were many reasons for this approach as we needed to insert galleries into more than one post and replace a ton of flash galleries in existing content that was merged into new theme.

Can you make sure the shortcode is returning its content, not echoing? This common mistake can produce results like you're seeing if the_content is applied to a post before the loop

Subject: [wp-hackers] Solution for automatic image importing.
Message-ID: <D1F1687E-A08C-4B72-98C6-A5A8F0D846F1@getmoxied.net>

Hi all! 

Here is my problem:
I'm reading json feed that contain image urls from direct server. 
I'm looking for solution to download every image from that feed into my wordpress library on my server and create a new post for every image and set all image as attachments - one image per post. 
I need to do it programmatically and check that feed for new images every 10 minutes (I will need cron for that I guess)

I wonder if anyone has experience with automatic image importing From server to server...


Thank you in advance!

Thanks a lot guys! your information saved me a lot of time and minimized my code! 
It didnt work for me until I included this modules:

 require_once(ABSPATH . "wp-admin" . '/includes/media.php');
 require_once(ABSPATH . "wp-admin" . '/includes/file.php');
 require_once(ABSPATH . "wp-admin" . '/includes/image.php');

Thank you!

In addition to what Daniel suggests (and he's spot on), you might also look into what caching is going on. The pattern you describe where you get one result on initial page load and another result after a reload is common for caching errors where the result is not properly cached so that it can be output where it belongs. 

Definitely start with Daniel's suggestion, a that's probably the cause of problems in the initial page load, and fixing that might fix the different result you get in the next page load.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Separating translations from plugin updates
Message-ID: <CAOqAKWALgnY8+rHMWdGMSbL1Ct3vh2uQicD+wKgxKouZxYgu-A@mail.gmail.com>

A plugin of mine in the WordPress.org plugin directory has been
translated into several other languages by some generous people. When
I'm sent a new translation I add it to the plugin, bump the version
number, and commit it.

This means I'm unnecessarily pushing out a plugin update for all those
users who have no need for the new translation. I wonder whether a
better translation deployment method could be introduced.

My idea is that the plugin update API could be split into two, one for
normal plugin updates as they are and one for translations. For
example, if you have a Polish language pack installed on your site
then when the plugin update check is performed it will alert you that
a new or updated Polish translation is available in a similar manner
to how plugin update notifications are displayed on the Plugins screen
and the Updates screen.

Just an idea. Thoughts?

I think this is another argument for the richer plugin metadata that I 
was talking about a month ago.

If there was richer machine-readable, strict-format metadata, then you 
could indicate "this update is only a language update".

Then within WordPress you could (either by a change to core, or via a 
further plugin to do this job), screen out those that were merely 
language updates, and only spend time on the important ones.

This richer metadata would have to be optional, as there's a huge stash 
of plugins where the authors will never get round to adding it. But the 
presence of the metadata would be informative - it'd be one more data 
point to tell you which plugins are higher quality. Something is better 
than nothing.

But personally I have no idea in what forum I should float this idea, if 
ever I got the idea to write it up with the pros and cons. Who has 
influence over these things? This isn't part of WordPress core, but of 
the wordpress.org API - who is in charge of that? Who do I need to send 
the idea to?

Subject: [wp-hackers] ipad & wordpress for ios - mini app or "plugin"?
Message-ID: <CAGEuVU3+1gNjSim=yS2mJsa7WqMNROTU4YKPSe94MFeB1L80hw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm very experienced with WordPress but I have zero experience with iPad apps.

I have a client project that includes a very complex front-end form
for "making a pledge". It does actually register the person's details
using an account with a specific role, but (1) they can't login (as
yet - user accounts were used for potential future login requirement),
and (2) there's a lot of custom data included in the process.

The client wants something for their staff who are out at events
collecting pledges to quickly enter basic details. The front-end form
is usable, but it's heavily designed with a lot of extra stuff to
"hold the hand" of users who are doing it for the first time (and will
probably only ever do it a few times at most). These staff are doing
one after another, and they need something without the hand-holding
bells and whistles.

I wondered about the WP for iOS app. Am I misunderstanding apps by
thinking I might be able to hop on the back of this with my
stripped-down form? It's for admins / editors only, that's why I
thought of it. Can apps have "plugins"? Or would I be looking at
developing a little app from scratch?

Of course I can just create a new page in the standard web admin -
just wondering what the options are.

Many thanks,

Steve Taylor

Hey Steve,

The mobile apps can't have plugins and can only be used for editing post, pages and comments ( and little bit more ).
When you want to do extra stuff then you do indeed need to build a little app from scratch.

you could have a front-end page that's only visible to logged-in staff,
that makes use of the form-handling logic you've already built, but
contains a much simpler form and uses a very simple responsive stylesheet -
would that work?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Filter Posts by Custom Taxonomy with AJAX Select Lists
Message-ID: <36E99EAB-D5C8-46B4-9CBE-2AEEE81B9BB4@goteama.com>

I am working on a fairly complicated filtering 'search' page for a site that has over 3500 posts and a large, active, user base. This search will likely become a primary page for any site user. The site is on a VPS, and runs fine, but the owners try and keep their memory needs down to a minimum to reduce costs as they are a non-profit.

I have three custom taxonomies: Artists, Years and Genres that are associated with the posts. The page displays three multi-select boxes - one for each taxonomy. Users can select as many of the terms in each as they like, they then click to search and AJAX returns the HTML to the page for anything found.

That part works fine. The issue is that there is a high potential for null searchs, primarily because of too many terms used. Most of the artists have well under 100 posts, whereas years and genres can have a couple hundred at most. Selecting an artist and then a year or genre will usually result in a a zero set. Having users pound the database for null sets seems foolish.

My hope was that I could have data attributes in the select options - one for post counts (already provided in my term objects) and one for the IDs of posts in that term. This would serve two purposes:

- As users choose terms I can display how many posts for the taxonomy (These artists have 5 posts) Seeing that there is a small set of posts would stop users from feeling the need to add a bunch more terms to limit the results.

- The IDs could potentially be used to determine if the selected terms contain any common posts, if so, how many.

The problem is that the only way I can find to get the ids of the posts in a term is by running a new WP_Query for each term. I had hoped to use get_objects_in_term but that returns more than posts. It takes quite a while to build the page on first load.

My hope is that with caching the page (and all the data) would load rapidly, and that some fancy javascript responses will prevent users from searching for nulls and keeping my server a bit happier. Is this a good trade off? Is there a more efficient way to do this? Is there some other approach I am overlooking?

Happy to provide code if needed.

Thanks for any opinions or information.

Aris,

If all you want to do is cut down on the number of null searches, you might
consider using something like a bloom filter, see here for more info:
http://www.adayinthelifeof.nl/2012/04/09/bloom-filters/

You would want to invalidate / rebuild it on post creation, as well.

Cheers,

 -- Peter

Seems like a bug. Care to submit a bug report?

Thanks for letting me know the score on apps.

The current front-end form is pretty complex and very hard to
re-purpose. I think it'll be a new admin screen...

Thanks again!

Hi Steve,

Another alternative could be to make a mobile version of the form so that
visiting it from a mobile device shows you the cut-down version instead,
maybe with a hint to say if you need help please use a desktop.

It might not be an option for you, but it'd be simpler  :)

Cheers,
Japh

What about using a simple Google Docs Form and integrating it with your
site?  You can very quickly create a form in Google Docs and all the
responses end up in a spreadsheet which is pretty easy to export to
something else.  You can use (shameless plug) the WordPress Google Forms
plugin to put the Google Form on a page or post on your WordPress site.

We do something very similar to what you are describing with our Middle
School Booster Club and using a Google Form is how I solved the problem.

Another idea ... if you haven't, look at wptouch. The default themes are
decent. You can create custom child themes if you want / have time. Create
a separate menu in the WP menu editor, with just the content you need for
this aspect. Set wptouch to use that menu. Define a different front page in
wptouch, if you want, maybe make the form the front page. Outside of
whatever time you need to recreate the form, the steps I outlined above are
mabye an hour, and you have a ipad friendly "theme".

Hi there,

In this post type listing panel (backend) I added a link so editor can set the featured image there, works ok but I can't make use thickbox. Is there some filter I can use to add thickbox in this page? (edit.php?post_type=pet)

I only found how to add scripts in plugin pages, no on existent pages.

Works ok, I'm adding thickbox so just using the default calls:


add_action('admin_print_scripts', 'pe_admin_script_generic' );

function pe_admin_script_generic() {
     global $parent_file;
     if('edit.php?post_type=pet' == $parent_file){
     wp_enqueue_script('thickbox',null,array('jquery'));
     wp_enqueue_style('thickbox.css', '/'.WPINC.'/js/thickbox/thickbox.css', 
null, '1.0');
 }
}


Don't know why the box is smaller and renders a scrollbar :S but is quite 
nice, better than nothing :)


Thanks Rafa

Message-ID: <CAGbA+aY9QarSvKt+fwS5inuZhE8eqqzLO63ipQ7POw9GG5ub5g@mail.gmail.com>

I've got a meta box using custom fields to replace the default WordPress
taxonomy meta boxes and I was wondering what would be the best function or
code snippet to disassociate a post from term(s)? Right now when the post
is saved or updated I'm checking to see if the term field for a particular
taxonomy has been posted and if not I'm doing the following:

wp_set_post_terms( $post_id, '', 'my_custom_taxonomy' );

Thanks!

Hi All.

Does anyone have experience with running cron on the server using
wp_schedule_event?

Thank you in advance.

Dmitry,

I just used the codex when I first starting setting up crons on client
sites, but that article Chris sent over looks great, wish I'd found it my
first time out.

I find this plugin very helpful as it gives you a nice list of what crons
are scheduled.

You could also try Scott Clark's "Crony" for managing cron jobs within
WordPress.

There's also Crontrol, which will tell you if WP-Cron on your site
isn't working: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-crontrol/

Subject: [wp-hackers] oembed with custom fields
Message-ID: <000601cd9eb6$ac6e7910$054b6b30$@lod.com>

Is it possible to use oembed with custom fields?

Ive tried using wp_oembed_get with the custom field value, but nothing seems
to show.

Example
$videourl = get_post_meta(get_the_ID(), 'video-link', true);
echo wp_oembed_get( $videourl);

video-link has the youtube url.

Hi Brian,

Just to let you know that we're still working on this page issue. We have
now a prototype using regular Wordpress hooks and doing the following :

   - First I can add more regarding the current page permalink behavior :
   if you suppress all the parent page slugs from the URL (keeping only the
   final page slug), Wordpress does a 301 redirection to the whole permalink.
   It's the same if you suppress only one parent page slug. However, if you
   modify a parent page slug or the final page slug, you'll have a 404 error.
   - It drove us to try the same solution we have applied for posts :
   introduce the post/page id into the permalink so that even the slug
   changes, a 301 redirection is done based on the id
   - We've managed to have a prototype working based on regular hooks.
   Basically, what it does is to add /[page id]/ at the end of the permalink.
   Based on this id and even the whole URL changes, the plugin manages to
   build the correct 301 redirection to the new permalink. So far tests are
   good.

We've planned to release a beta version of a page manager with this feature
in the next few weeks.

Regards.

Message-ID: <CADqS_axgQyFSatuy2owdkyUEKF2DvHGqQXxApTTAUe+NOtazXA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm having difficulty translating the options page of my plugin, using
Settings API.
Only the menu item and the page title are translated. Form fields
configuration (an array), do not translate.
What am I doing wrong?

A fragment of the code here: http://pastebin.com/beXRd69j


Thanks in advance!

You're defining these options and translating those strings into a
variable in the main body of the plugin (inside global scope), but not
calling the load_plugin_textdomain call until the 'init' action hook.
This means that your strings are being translated before your
text-domain loads, because the plugin load happens before init runs.

Move the definition of the settings (and translation of those strings)
into a function, then call that from your init function *after* you've
loaded your text-domain.

Hi Otto!
Thanks for responding....

I have this here:

//Hook up to the init action
add_action( 'init', 'init_wp_coming_soon' );
/**
* Runs when the plugin is initialized
*/

function init_wp_coming_soon() {
  // Setup localization
  //load_plugin_textdomain( 'wp_coming_soon', false, dirname(
plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) ) . '/lang' );  <--- doesn't work!
  load_plugin_textdomain( 'wp_coming_soon', false, dirname(
plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) ) );


  // Load JavaScript and stylesheets
  register_scripts_and_styles();

  add_action('wp_footer', 'frontend_add_to_footer');
  add_action('admin_menu', 'wp_coming_soon_add_admin_menu');
  add_action('admin_footer', 'backend_add_to_footer');

}

Chris,

I had the same problem you did. It finally came down to running the field
through html_entity_decode() in the 'the_content' filter.

Shorthand:
echo apply_filters( 'the_content', html_entity_decode( $videourl ) );

What happens if you are not using the_content though? also I should note im
have some oembeds that I registered handler ex wp_embed_register_handler
that are not your oembeds registered with wp or the site.

instead of tabs. WordPress code uses hard tabs (i.e. tab characters)
rather than soft tabs (i.e. spaces), so you need to be careful with this.

Hope that helps!
