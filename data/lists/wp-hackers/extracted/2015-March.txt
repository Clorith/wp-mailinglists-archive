Hi --

I updated a plugin of mine a week ago and it's still not showing up on the WP Plugins site.  Anyone know who I should talk to?

https://wordpress.org/plugins/quiz/

(A different plugin I updated showed up within hours.)

Thanks,

Stephen Rider

Hey Stephen, your readme.txt still says "Stable tag: 1.2", I bet if you
bump that to 1.3 it'll work.

Subject: [wp-hackers] A few 4.2 questions
Message-ID: <CAFnKAk22rtEJaY_RRpx_avatagpXXGY-MtyTtj7hs-OLFG0r=w@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings all,

In testing the new 4.2 I've noticed some important differences from the
older 4.1:

First of all, the redesigned wp-views - they seem to break compatibility,
even with the old minimal example on github
<https://github.com/dtbaker/wordpress-mce-view-and-shortcode-editor/issues>
that has been working for a few versions now. Will there be a migration
guide for this view system soon?

Second, something I just now noticed, is the latest version seems to lack
the execCommands listing:
In WP4.1, you could run "tinymce.activeEditor.execCommands" in js console
and see what commands you could call execCommand( commandname ) on. In the
latest this seems to be missing. Was this replaced with something else?


Best regards,
Luke

Hi,

In case anyone's interested, an alert for a plugin I recently released...

https://wordpress.org/plugins/simba-plugin-updates-manager/

It allows you to host and manage plugin updates for (free) plugins that 
you distribute from your own site (instead of from wordpress.org). It's 
a cleaned-up + tweaked version of code that's been in use on 
updraftplus.com for 2 years, so is pretty stable.

Best wishes,
David

Hi David,

Thanks for sharing that! It looks awesome and I'll definitely give it a go
at some point.

Cheers,
Nikola

That's the client-side code - the plugin I linked to was a plugin for 
providing the *server* end, managed through a WP dashboard.

Best wishes,
David

Question, Is there any plans to do the same with themes as well?
