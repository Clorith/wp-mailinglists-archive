Hey all,

Had a bit of trouble yesterday with the "the_content" function escaping 
some JS code and for the life of me, I couldn't find the filter that was 
causing the problem, and then I discovered this:

function the_content($more_link_text = '(more...)', $stripteaser = 0, $more_file = '') {
    $content = get_the_content($more_link_text, $stripteaser, $more_file);
    $content = apply_filters('the_content', $content);
    $content = str_replace(']]>', ']]&gt;', $content);    <---  WHY HERE?
    echo $content;
}


Can someone with a broader sense of the system explain why the_content 
is doing this here instead of in the filter?  Is this a bug or is there 
a reason I'm not seeing?  Trunk code, btw.

Thanks!

Because shared hosting environments are very resistant to change,
particularly if that change will break things for a lot of people.

Dreamhost gives you the option of running php4 and php5, btw.

Why upgrade if the version we are on works? Also, some of us are in  
hosted environments where we aren't in control and/or upgrading would  
break something else other than WP. And, some of us are in hosted  
environments where our sys-admins haven't had the bandwidth to do a  
thorough analysis of the pros and cons of 5.x. (read: security)

Subject: [wp-hackers] how to interface plugin with the loop?
Message-ID: <20060502121926.CC4215CC0@comox.textdrive.com>

Hi,

I'm working on a search plugin that is not based on the Wordpress search.

I can't figure out how I would make the results of a search get displayed in
a template file that uses the loop?

I would like to use a template file with have_posts and then loop through
the results, but I don't know how to call the template file from my plugin
and I don't how to talk to the have_posts function so that it will take the
search results of my plugin?

 

Thank you for your help.

 

Steve

... or break WordPress itself.  I've seen a fair number of PHP 5.1  
users for whom WordPress sporadically shows blank pages (i.e. sends  
200 OK but doesn't send the content).

If PHP 5.1 were backwards compatible, I think more would upgrade.   
But there's a big chicken/egg scenario going on.  No one wants to  
make their web app PHP 5 only, and no one wants to upgrade to PHP 5  
when (a) it might break PHP4 apps and (b) there's no great reward to  
offset (a).

All we can do is work our hardest to make our apps run in PHP4 and 5  
equally well.  And, maybe, for a new app, if it makes development  
sense, go PHP 5 only and hope that your app is good enough to  
convince people up upgrade.

The following hooks interface with the main query:

http://wphooks.flatearth.org/type/sql/

(sorry, none are yet documented, but you can look them up in the  
source to see where they are and what they do... maybe someone who  
has done something similar can chime in with their hook of choice for  
something like this)

Basically, you can just trash the default query and use your own  
query.  Then your query's results will be used in the loop  
automatically.

I'd just have it work with search.php ... i.e. set $wp_query- 
 >is_search = true; as you're modifying the query.  No need to make a  
special template file if you're looking to replace WordPress' search  
function.  But, if you did want to use a special template name, you'd  
probably use the template_redirect hook:

Message-ID: <e8e97f9f0605020703o223722b6nf91e01394b789893@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I was informed that this is a touchy subject, but I want to raise it
anyhow as I just really want to see it change.

Basically, everywhere I look I see WordPress people endorsing trailing
slashes and shooting down people who want it otherwise. I can see why
trailing slashes make sense. For me, personally, they don't on posts
and Pages, however. I consider my posts and Pages objects in the
folder [root]/ or /2006/05/. That itself may be a topic of discussion,
but it is possible, I know it is: why isn't there the option to make
it so? Abolishing non-trailing-slash URIs should be the default
option, tops. Not the sole option.


On that topic, is it possible to modify WordPress (preferably through
a plug-in) to kill the trailing slash on posts and Pages and make sure
everything adheres to that, i.e. w/ trailing slash 301 forwards to
slashless?


-Rob.

Sorry Mark I didn't see the last part of your reply. 
I'm not really looking at replacing the existing search as I will use my
search to produce results from an additional database table. I've had a look
at the filters and hooks and using them makes sense.
What I haven't worked out yet is how I get my own search function to
actually interface with the main query? Since I'm not modifying the existing
search my own search would have to trigger the same actions as the original
search, so that the filters can be applied to these actions.
What I'm trying to say is, how do I get Wordpress to execute my own search
query and then perform basically like the original query (i.e. take the
results and loop them into a template file, when a user calls my search
function?

Thank you for your help.

Steve

Take a look in trac and find when that line was added. There may be a
good explanation in the related ticket.

Thanks Andy,

I didn't think of that.

I found it: Changeset 1039
Date: Mar 2004
Message is: fixed multiple breakage possibilities with feeds

If that is true, should this only be applicable in the_content_rss and 
not the_content?  Regardless if that is true, I think this would be 
better suited to a filter call.  I think someone with more experience 
with the core should look at this though.  It's probably only a minor 
oversight.

Hm, that's some slow-moving decision-making. Thanks for that.

On this topic, Joen Asmussen had this idea that, when a page has
subpages (/about has /about/me and /about/weblog), it should be
trailing-slashed, because it is in a sense a folder. This made me
doubt many things. I believe that /about is an object (and don't
anyone start on the server side of this with some folder-redirecting
nonsense), but /about/me would be an object in an object treated as a
folder. I'm not sure how this fits into my scheme yet.

So once again, does anyone have any clueful insights into this? I like
it when the Pages and posts are being treated as objects, but want to
make sure the practice makes sense. (As usual, I will just ignore
extremism.)

Thanks!
-Rob.

Hi,
I'm still looking for answers on how to interface my own search function
with the wordpress loop to display the results. I don't think I have really
explained what I'm trying to do:

I'm working on a plugin that is supposed to make queries to a table I
created in addition to the existing Wordpress tables.
I created the table because I needed to add extra data to posts and the meta
value table would not have an efficient way to store the data.
The table contains the post ID as well as the additional data fields. The
queries results will be a list of post ID's that match a certain set of data
fields.

With the list of post ID's I then want to query the posts database and
display the search results, like the existing search function displays them.

My problem is, I don't know how I can make my search function talk Wordpress
so that the results (i.e. the posts that match certain values from my own
table) get displayed on a page, using the loop?
I don't think I can use any use filters such as posts_where, as this uses
Wordpress' own query and not my own, or can I?

I've been stewing over this for a few days now and any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks.
Steve

Don't be bashful! Go right ahead and work up a patch. You're not

Two more filters to consider:
posts_join (along with posts_where, you can accomplish your search in one query)
posts_request (total control over the query, if you're daring)

Thanks Andy.

The query is one issue, the bigger problem I have at the moment is how to
execute my own query first and then use these results to CALL the actual
Wordpress search, since I'm not using the Wordpress search form.
In non programming terms: how do I get Wordpress to "execute the stuff it
would normally execute when someone pushes the Search button" i.e. find the
posts, display the results in the template doing the loop, etc...

Let's put some specs on this. Do you already know exactly which post
IDs you want to display? If that's the ticket, just add something like
" ID in (1, 2, 3)" with the posts_where filter.

Bring a spec.

Message-ID: <200605040134.k441Xv9M007925@post.webmailer.de>

Sorry to bother you again guys.

I'm trying to link to an external html file from within wordpress and so far
it doesn't seem to work. By external I mean a user clicks on a link and a
new window opens, displaying the html file without the wordpress template
around it. 

The html file sits in the in the plugin directory. If I use an absolute link
to the file it works, but I would like to make a mod rewrite rule to conceal
the actual url.

 

My htaccess file looks like this:

# BEGIN WordPress

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

RewriteEngine On

RewriteBase /digitalcamera/

RewriteCond %

{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

RewriteRule . /digitalcamera/index.php

</IfModule>

# END WordPress

 

I've added:

RewriteRule ^/mypage/help.php$ /wp-content/plugins/myplugin/help.php

 

 

But it doesn't work. Wordpress simply displays "404 not found" in the
content area.

Any ideas?

 

Steve

I've added right after RewriteBase /digitalcamera/ but it's still displaying
the 404 error inside the Wordpress template. 

I created the following simple .htaccess file:
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /digitalcamera/
#the following line should redirect to test.html
RewriteRule ^/test.html$ /test/test.html
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /digitalcamera/index.php
</IfModule>
# END WordPress

The test directory is located at /digitalcamera/test.
So if I type in http://myhost.com/digitalcamera/test.html it should use mod
rewrite to display http://myhost.com/digitalcamera/test/test.html, but it
doesn't. As I said, it's still displaying the 404 error inside the Wordpress
template.

Any ideas?

Steve

You need to remove the inital "/" in the match rule. That
would be enough to get it working, but you should also
escape the "." to be fully correct. (Regular expressions -
otherwise "testahtml" would also be rewritten).

Also if "test/test.html" is a relative directory, you should
drop the leading slash there too.

What you need is:
RewriteRule ^test\.html$ test/test.html

You're not the only one. RegEx should not be so difficult to learn.
It's just a straight forward set of rules.  But like you say, it 
just doesn't stick.  I think half the problem for me is that 1and1 
has some overriding HTACCESS settings and some of the things that
should work just don't.  So, half the time, I think I am writing 
correctly syntaxed RegEx and 1and1 is blocking it. The other 
half of the time, I've corrupted the expression trying to fix what
isn't broken. That gives me a near 100% failure rating and when I 
do get it working, I just chock/chalk that up to statistical error.

I just came accross this really great thread that is all about primary 
keys:

   http://feedlounge.com/blog/2005/11/20/switched-to-postgresql/

AFAIK the space problems with non-numeric primary keys mentioned in the 
thread are only applicable to InnoDB.

Actually I think using object would be more appropriate.

I'd rather see it be Web 2.0 myself (that is, AJAX), as well as changing the 
Dashboard to be 'modularized' like Widgets.  Let me choose the Dashboard 
Widgets I want (don't default them, thank you!), and have people write them 
to use JS/AJAX whenever possible.

Just a thought.

Even more appropriate would be using the new cron system to keep the
feeds up to date and never having the dashboard page itself load them,
just load the cached object out of the database.

While  I  don't know the WP cron system properly, it sounds as though  you
suggest  that each site pulls the feeds periodically. Wouldn't that  raise
the  load  on the local server and the servers holding the (remote)  feeds
significantly? All for a mere gain in terms of speed? Some Web-based  feed
readers have the tendency to do this, but it's expensive.

Best wishes,

Roy

It could be set to pull down the feeds only once or twice a day.

...Yet  it  comes to show the deficiency of caching. Check too  frequently
and hog resources; check infrequently and present out-of-date information.

Frankly,  I quite liked your idea of using <iframe> or <object> to isolate
feeds.  The entry to the dashboard can otherwise become slow and very much
a  'necessary evil' to those of us who don't work around it. To say  more,
in  reference  to  another route down this thread,  the  proposed  AJAX/JS
solution  would  hinder  accessibility, so this seems  like  a  relatively
poorer  solution. A customisable dashboard (/a la/ Widgets) seems like  an
optimal solution to me (just my humble opinion).

As  to other ideas: data prefetching for feeds, use of stylehseet to alter
the  order/flow  of content and thus the order in which file requests  are
made  in  most  Web browsers. There are several such  subtle  optimisation
tricks.

Best wishes,

Roy

We already cache.

This would be the point of the cron, the data would be prefetched and
not on page load.

We've talked about these things in the past and they are not a
solution, and cannot be in a software like WordPress, there are too
many outside factors to consider:

-Things like mod_gzip, which have their own buffer inside apache, and
won't send to the browser until the page is done loading.
-The adverse performance effects of flush(), its unreliability on
certain PHP SAPIs
-etc.

I find the performance and usefulness of Dashboard are amazingly
improved by commenting out line 5 of wp-admin/index.php and checking the
feed websites directly in a browser as necessary.

Other folks mentioned some really interesting ideas (ajax, cron+caching, 
etc), but I figured that the amount of time the iframe solution takes (15 
minutes) is worth the noticable improvement in responsiveness, so I went 
ahead and threw something together:

Would love to hear feedback.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Registering widget function
Message-ID: <ff1ad1fe0605052336l13a817a4wba38b991b28d181@mail.gmail.com>

Can you register a widget with a reference to a class function like you can
plugins? I am trying to use the following code but no widget shows up.

if (!function_exists('widget_irgShowCoComments_init')) {
    function widget_irgShowCoComments_init() {
        global $irgSCC;
        if (function_exists('register_sidebar_widget') &&
function_exists('register_widget_control')) {
            register_sidebar_widget('showCoComments', array(&$irgSCC,
'widget_irgShowCoComments'));
            register_widget_control('showCoComments', array(&$irgSCC,
'widget_optionsPage'), '700', '450');
        }
    }
}

if (function_exists(add_action)) {
    add_action('plugins_loaded', 'widget_irgShowCoComments_init');
}

Yeah, I thought that too, so I built one. I haven't re-introduced the
feeds but I reckon I'll just add Widget hooks to achieve that.

Yes,  this  was mentioned before in this mailing list. This can easily  be
achieved  by plugging in RSS Merge v0.2.0, which is closely-related to the
WordPress   codebase,   but  is  not  dependent  or  restricted   by   it:

Actually, my WP CG-FeedRead plugin (also 'not dependent or restricted') has 
a feature I called 'MultiFeed' which can pull N items apiece from M feeds 
specified, and then 'intermix' results based on the GMT timestamps on the 
feed items.  (I also have a little-used and untested feature called 
'ReFeed', which will regenerate an XML/RSS simplified output for the 
multifeed..)  And unlike RSS Merge, it has its own XML parser, all in one. 
;) ;)

But, the main issue is making the dashboard easier to support alternate 
user-chosen 'data', rather than just feeds.... There's a lot of great 
information you might want to present there (think Mint, or my CG-Referrer 
stats tracker..).  Thus my proposition to think in terms of 'dashboard 
widgets'.

I'm still interested in doing an adoDB port, but I'll be waiting for
WP 2.1 to be released before I start. I _had_ convinced my project
manager to give me 5 working days to work on an adoDB port of WP for
an upcoming project; unfortunately/fortunately we ave since added
MySQL5 to our production and dev environments so I lost the 5 days :(

Message-ID: <a05210606c0858e1660a9@[192.168.1.101]>

Howdy all,

    Earlier today I got word that I had linkspam showing up in entries 
on meyerweb-- they showed up in Bloglines, for example, and also some 
people's aggregators showed recent posts as having been modified.
    It turns out someone went in and added link spam to the post 
contents of the most recent 30 or so posts.  Here's an example of one 
such post, pulled from my wp-cache files:

    http://meyerweb.pastebin.com/706548

The spam shows up at lines 83-121.  Here's another:

    http://meyerweb.pastebin.com/706585

In that case, the spam is at lines 75-113.
    I was able to remove the spam from meyerweb by manually editing 
the post contents for each affected post.  In other words, the spam 
content had been added to the DB records-- this is not a wp-cache 
problem.  That's just where I was able to harvest copies of the 
offending content.  It's also not a comment problem; this stuff is 
injected into the actual post_content field.
    The spam always shows up after three or so paragraphs, whether 
that means the end of the post or somewhere in the middle, which 
feels like the work of a regexp or some other pattern search.  I also 
tracked down the activity which stuck the spam into my records. 
That's here:

    http://meyerweb.pastebin.com/706549

The pattern of accesses also reminds me of a script.  Note there are 
two blocks of changes, temporally speaking.  I'm not anywhere close 
to the IP block of the accesses in question; they're in the 207.* 
block and I'm a good deal lower than that.
    Now for the details of my WP install: I'm running 1.5, as I really 
hate the admin interface of 2.0, even with rich editing turned off. 
(If it remembered which of those cute little option boxes to leave 
expanded, I'd be a lot happier, but never mind that now.)  I'm 
willing to upgrade to fix this, though I'd want to wait at least a 
few days to see if the problem happens again.  The only plugins 
running that I didn't write myself are Akismet and wp-cache.  The 
plugins I wrote are all content modifiers, like ordinalizing numbers 
from 1-10, outputting a slightly different monthly calendar, and 
turning off auto-formatting of posts (but not comments).  I don't 
think any of them could be a doorway, but it's hard to be certain.
    I chatted with the #wordpress folks and nobody there seemed to 
know what might be happening, with the only real guess being that 
maybe my WP admin password was compromised.  I changed my admin 
password after the breaches documented above, and will watch my 
access logs to see if there are any more attempts.  I don't know for 
sure that my password was compromised, though if there's a log 
somewhere that I could check for admin logins, I'll gladly do so.  Is 
there?
    Like I said, if this sort of thing is a known problem with 1.5, 
I'm willing to upgrade to fix it, much though I may curse the 
interface afterward.  If this isn't something that's been seen 
before, I thought it was worth bringing to your attention.  Thanks 
for any insights.

There's another related issue which is privacy: if you're running a  
private weblog that you don't want anyone to know about, it should be  
possible to switch off the Technorati feeds and so on that give away  
the weblog's URL. For this reason, it would be nice to be able to  
optionally disable certain feeds (but probably not the main feed for  
alerts of Wordpress updates).

There's a version 1.5.3 in Beta, I think  (
http://www.tamba2.org.uk/T2/archives/2006/03/18/wp-153/ )

If I recall correctly from the little chatter I've heard about it, it
contains some security fixes, and, iirc again, you can get it from SVN
as well.

I didn't notice that over here (just re-checked this to confirm). Oddly,
however, a recent item of yours ("Flummmoxed By Frameworks") did now show
up as new, although it *should* have. I am using RSSOwl if that matters.

I hope you have added 207.42.135.122 to yours IP deny list. I know I have. I
still run a modified copy of Mingus (1.2) on a few sites. Use of old version
increases the need for caution.

Judging by the patterns, e.g.:

There *may* be some backdoor in the handling of
edit.php?m=MONTH&submit=Show+Month perhaps? I don't know what these
arguments are intended to achieve. Maybe bad handling of exceptions?

This can't do much harm /assuming/ you have not modified  much of  your code
(I know Eric Meyer has "hacked WordPress like it was attacking his family").
Time-wise, it might be worth  going over the changelog for 1.5.3 and,  based
on the log, see if it  fixes the problem at hand. It could return  to attack
via proxies and become detrimental. The only real solution is patching.

With kind regards,

Roy

Looking at this I think your admin password was compromised as before
any changes take place there is a login attempt which I believe was
probably sucessfull looking at the next page that was loaded.

Login Attempt:
207.42.135.122 - - [08/May/2006:14:30:06 +0000] "POST
/eric/thoughts/wp-login.php HTTP/1.1" 302 5
"http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-login.php" "Mozilla/4.0
(compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)"

And load of admin index page:
207.42.135.122 - - [08/May/2006:14:30:10 +0000] "GET
/eric/thoughts/wp-admin/ HTTP/1.1" 200 12936
"http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-login.php" "Mozilla/4.0
(compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)"

There are then a number of POST's for post editing which would explain
the apperance of the links.

Of course it does. If that bothers you, comment out line 5 of

An AJAX one would be super-easy with Prototype's Ajax.Updater.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Easytags template system
Message-ID: <44613582.8070600@mullenweg.com>

Came across this today:

http://businesslogs.com/reviews/movable_type_vs_wordpress_my_opinion.php

It's generally complimentary, but raises the oft-repeated point that 
people get scared by <?php ... ?> even though most templating systems 
are functionally equivalent to PHP. (Which I think can be very true.) 
So I thought I'd throw out an idea I've had baking for quite a while but 
haven't gotten around to coding: easytags.

Basically the concept is that it's very easy to parse something like 
<$the_title$> into <?php the_title(); ?>. What if there was a plugin (or 
in WP core) an option that gave you a "friendly" view when editing 
templates? On display it could hide all the scary PHP it knows how to 
parse behind psuedo-HTML tags, and on save turn it back into the PHP 
that WordPress knows and love.

Version two could have friendly arguments, so <$the_title before="yo"$> 
maps to the proper function calls. (This would be easier if we had a 
parse_str or array equiv for all functions with multiple arguments.)

Version three+ doesn't need to be restricted to any one particular 
syntax. WordPress says <?php potato(); ?>, MT says <$$$potato$$$>, 
Blogger says <$potatospot$>, and Greymatter mumbles something under its 
breath about the potato famine... why not let people choose what style 
they want to use -- or even better yet natively support templates from 
other systems. It's just another set of regexes. All of a sudden the 
switching costs to WordPress just dropped as low as we could feasibly 
take them.

Obscure systems could be support in plugins, it's all just a filter anyway.

There is no additional overhead to WP because it's all stored as PHP at 
the end of the day (and for every page load). PHP or tags that aren't 
supported could just be left as-is. It doesn't need to be perfect, just 
to cover the 80% of each system that people actually use.

A month or so ago I introduced myself and let everyone know that I had 
ported my AutoTheme HTML Theme System to Wordpress.  It does exactly 
what you have outlined and more.  As for supporting templates from other 
systems, AutoTheme is already the predominant theme system for PHP-Nuke, 
PostNuke, osCommerce, CRE Loaded shops etc...

I would be happy to answer any questions and provide any 
testing/evaluation help that you might need.

There are thousands of AutoTheme themes on the Internet, both free and 
commercial.  Yes, some are crappy, but some are very nice also.

AutoTheme goes beyond just templating.  It has taken the approach of a 
full theme system that uses templates, not just a template engine or 
language.

Also new is the ability to separate all of the side bar content into 
individual blocks that can be positioned anywhere on the page.  This is 
rudimentary now, but can easily be improved.

I have a demo site up at http://wp.spidean.com.  I would be happy to 
give trusted members of this list admin access to see the functionality 
so far.

Thanks!

If you get creative, then you can parse something like <?php 
the_title(); ?> this same way.  There's no need for the p-code garbage. 
  Maybe importers could be extended to convert themes?  This would make 
sense of keeping them around after their initial job is done.

Having implemented the proposed functionality already under HTMLArea for 
a different project, I can attest that it's more trouble than it's worth 
to come up with artificial loop constructs.  Nevermind that their 
implementation is never as good as the real thing, but then the obscure 
syntaxes need to be documented - something that the WordPress community 
has thus far struggled to maintain even with its current set of stable 
PHP-based template tags.

There is a large body of other arguments against easytags and for native 
code.  I'm omitting those here to prevent myself from imploding.

Finally, the flexible templating feature as described is way outside the 
scope of what I would personally care for WordPress to ever do for me, 
since the majority of existing WordPress templates rock the socks off of 
anything I could steal from MT/wherever and rolling custom PHP is better 
than anything that could be done with p-code.

When Mike Rundle says "that could just be the opinion of somebody used 
to how MT does things, so take with a grain of salt", that's pretty much 
what I see going on here.

Are there studies that indicate that templating systems like MT's
actually are easier to use than PHP?  Considering how most people on
the street are baffled even by HTML, I wonder if <?php the_title(); ?>
is really that much scarier than <MTEntryTitle$>. How many more people
are going to start editing their themes because they can use the
latter instead of the former?

    Not yet.  I actually want them to try again, so I can see if it's 
a password crack or something else.  (I've changed the password.) 
I'm willing to undertake the effort of cleaning up after another 
successful attack if allowing it helps figure out exactly what 
happened.  So far, no posts have been modified since I cleaned up 
after the last two attacks and changed my admin password.
    Although if they cracked the admin password, I'd like to know how. 
I haven't seen any apparent attempts to brute-force it, and I'm not 
sure how it could have been swiped-- and why would someone bother in 
the first place?  The effort needed to crack a password on a single 
blog just doesn't seem worth the payoff.
    So here's what I have found, little though it may tell anyone:

    http://meyerweb.pastebin.com/708792

That shows All of the instances where there were attempts to access 
the WP admin area and the client was redirected to the login page.  I 
highlighted the two known breakins, but there's a third that wasn't a 
breakin but interested me.  I highlighted it too-- what drew my 
attention was the "Show+Month" bit.  So I searched for all instances 
of that IP address and came up with:

    http://meyerweb.pastebin.com/708795

So if that was a breakin attempt, it failed.  I just find it 
interesting that there's been more than one attempt to get in that 
way.  It might be the same person from multiple machines, of course.
    I searched my access logs again for all "Show+Month" entries, but 
they were all either the original breakins, this now one I show 
above, or my own machines.

    I dunno.  That's why I brought it up here, just in case there was 
a previously unknown vulnerability.

>(I know Eric Meyer has "hacked WordPress like it was attacking his family").

    Actually, not any more.  I'm running 1.5 and all the 'hacking' is 
now in theme files, or else via plugins I wrote for myself.  The core 
itself is largely or completely undisturbed.  I did a test upgrade to 
2.0 on my local server and there weren't any hiccups in terms of the 
install running, so I suspect "completely", but it's been a long time

    Unless of course whatever they're doing isn't solved by the latest 
version.  I'm assuming that all this isn't an obvious example of a 
widely known problem with the 1.5x series, though.

If you really feel that's the case, and there's been no evidence to the 
contrary, then I'd recommend we stop this thread, you remove the pastebin 
stuff, and contact the security list.  Just IMHO from other similar recent 
discussions where that was the end suggestion...

I don't think many. It seems to me that the WP templating system is
already simple. I honestly don't see what's so scary about <?php ..
?>. Even when I knew next to nothing about php, a couple php tags
didn't scare me off from theme-ing my site. If it's what I have to do,
it's what I have to do. And if people know enough to be editing or
making themes, they shouldn't be scared. The most common template tags
are documented well enough on the Codex.

It may provide for a marginal amount of crossovers, but that's
marginal. Of course, someone with a custom theme in MT doesn't want to
go through all that trouble of re-editing and it would be convenient.

It's a neat idea, but I think it would be best kept to plugins.

I wasn't suggesting a template system at all, just a filter on the WP 
template-editing textareas that make the template syntax friendlier for 
people editing through the web form.

The only additional overhead would be for viewing and saving the 
template edit form. Not a lick of other WP code would change, all the 
files would still be saved as native PHP. This would preclude any of the 
templating systems that parse on runtime, like all of the ones evaluated 
3 years ago here:

Neither do I, but so many people have said it so many times over the 
years, even if I don't understand it I can't deny that it exists. I 
think it's because it *looks* like programming even though it isn't, and 
it also has the "<?php" everywhere. Maybe it would be less scary if we 
used short tags, but that isn't really an option for us because of 
compatibility issues.

What it really comes down to is whatever part of WP makes people feel 
dumb should be softened if it's within our ability to do so.

There's something to be said for the "there isn't a problem that needs
fixing" argument, especially when it keeps people away from things that
obviously they can't handle (for whatever reason).

That is however the advantage of the approach you're suggesting.  If you
cause the code to change from:

   <?php potato(); ?>

to:

   <$potato$>

Not only does it not frighten the timid as much, it's far less likely
they're going to break it during editing, and if they do, it's far more
likely they'll be able to see what's wrong with it.  That has *got* to
be a plus.

Is it going to know both:

<?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>

and

<?php if (have_posts()) : ?>

	<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>

? (From the classic theme and Kubrick, respectively.)

What about the various deprecated loop syntaxes, and all their
variants of spacing and punctuation? What about plugins?

It's not going to understand every code snippet and plugin function,
so many/most themes are going to be a confusing morass of PHP and
"easytags" all mixed into one. That sounds rather worse than the
system now.

I'm curious as to the reasoning behind the thinking that <$potato$>
would be less scary or cause less timidity than <?php potato(); ?>. If
someone was scared of "<?php", imagine how they may feel about seeing
to dollar signs instead. "Php" is somewhat recognizable by itself, and
the person can say, "Okay, this must be invoking some kind of php
code." If they see <$ .. $>, they'll have no idea what's going on.

But I'm nit-picking, I know <$ .. $> was just an example.

I think if WP were to use "easytags," it'd do best to use tags a la
TextPattern, which look like XHTML tags with a "txp:" prefix, complete
with closing tags, slashes, etc. (see
http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Alphabetical_Tag_Listing
for examples and such).

I'd definitely second this. I've always found TextPattern's template 
tags to be very intuitive, and they'd be a breeze to learn for theme 
authors who will already be comfortable with (X)HTML.

To my mind, the purpose of a templating system is to hide the application
logic and provide a simple way of substituting and iterating through data
objects.

Wordpress doesn't have a templating system. At all. Right now. It has inline
PHP. Regardless of whether or not you thing this is a good thing from a
grokking perspective (and I don't, because PHP syntax is very, very fussy
and glyph-heavy compared to HTML, which isn't good for newbiews), it's a bad
thing from a templating perspective because it encourages crappy code.

Like putting SQL or ez-SQL requests inline in a template. Ouch. Use a
plugin! Use the APIs!

The loop is probably the least intuitive thing in Wordpress's theme engine
right now. That's because it exposes how the code is understood by the
interpreter, and not how it's understood by humans. So: MT's
<MTEntries><MTEntry>...</MTEntry></MTEntries> makes a lot of sense to
non-programmers. Here's a block of "Entries", and here's the sample layout
for a single "Entry". The template works the way I imagine it. The parsers
then finds MTEntries and substitutes it with a foreach loop.

So, in a true templating system, you wouldn't directly put a "simplified
version" of loop code in. You'd just put <$wp_posts$>...foo...</$wp_posts$>
or something.

So now we run into problems. Any templating engine is going to end being a
reduction of what's possible in straight-up PHP. There are a couple of
obvious options:

limit what "easytags" can do and say "look, if you want to do
complex/non-standard stuff, use inline PHP" [I think this is bad because
inline PHP is bad]
find a way of using PHP and easytags in the same template [better, but
complex]
somehow make easytags do EVERYTHING [unlikely].

Basically, it's an executive decision about the direction of the project -
should easytags be for one user and inline-PHP for another, or should both
be options? I think "easy" is poor nomenclature, because it implies
"newbie". It's not about making things simpler. It's about giving Wordpress
a proper templating syntax.

Regarding ease-of-use: most people coming to Wordpress new know some HTML.
If you've come from Blogger, you know some HTML. Maybe not enough to design
a theme from scratch, but enough to fiddle with what's inside it. If you've
managed to install Wordpress, you probably enough HTML competency to use
quicktags. PHP has _very strange syntax_ compared to HTML, because it is not
a templating language. All the brackets, the semi-colons, seperating
arguments with commas right; there's so much to get wrong! And smattering it
through a document inline leads to messy code - and also makes it hard for
new people to understand. I mean, complex inline PHP documents are hard for
anyone to parse (compared to a nice single piece of code and a Smarty
template).

I think quicktags/easytags/whatever are definitely easier to grok if you're
smart enough to run blog software. As i said, though, it's not about
easy/hard. It's about doing templating right. It's about letting all the new
users know that you shouldn't drop SQL inline just because you can.
Currently, if you don't know PHP, messing around with WP themes is likely to
lead to you writing _crappy code_. WP should foster its users, no matter
what their competency, and by encouraging true templating, more people are
going to use plugins and the API as they're intended. So I think it'd be
good for the project as a whole.

And yes, before I get flamed to fuck, I'm aware that PHP was designed as a
templating engine. But it _isn't any more_.

You wouldn't have to learn two syntaxes, though. If you preferred to 
write in pure PHP then you could, but if you preferred the simpler 
syntax then you could choose that. As far as I can see, it's win-win.

Heh.  I wasn't aware that anyone used that page.  :)

Are you suggesting that TinyMCE be used there, too?  Or would this be a 
textarea-only (or set by the existing user toggle?) option?

Considering now what you really have in mind, I don't see a problem in 
adding a pre and post filter on that editor and letting plugins handle 
it.  I'm still not enamored with the idea of weighing down the core with 
easytags for a feature (the built-in template editor) that I doubt many 
people use.  Some polling of regular users might be useful.

Note to others in the thread: Please re-read Matt's reply to mine. 
Templates wouldn't change, just the admin editor page.  It would have 
filters that converted things like <wp:loop></wp:loop> into their php 
counterparts on save, and vice-versa on load.  At no point would a theme 
file actually contain those tags.  (Right, Matt?)

I think the issue here is that there's no way for Joe Sixpack to
determine right off the bat (without consulting the WP Template Tags
reference in the Codex) what is Official WordPress Template Code(TM) and
what is actual functional php.  For instance, themes/"mods" such as K2,
Canvas, Squible, etc. extensively use WP TT's, as well as custom
function calls and even some embedded queries in order to do all manner
of extra non-core functionality.  It's very difficult for average users
to, at a glance, readily understand what's going on in a certain theme
because, as far as they're concerned, a call to <?php
the_excerpt_reloaded(); ?> isn't immediatel distinguishable from <?php
the_excerpt(); ?>, sans extensive theme author commenting.

The MT-style template tags are readily identifiable as SEPARATE from the
rest of the HTML markup, while in WP, all the php has a tendency to run
together and we end up getting plugin peanut butter in our core
chocolate.  J6P would like that to NOT be the case, if I'm reading
everything correctly.

A common misconception. Anyone doing serious work with WordPress would 
have to learn both because they'd have to be able to read both dialects, 
even if they only chose to write in one or the other.

The importance of readability in code is vastly underestimated. A 
multitude of ways to say the same thing makes writing code marginally 
easier at the expense of a more than linear increase in the difficulty 
of reading code.

My thought from the sidelines on this one is that while I don't doubt 
that the current use of <?php ?> might be intimidating to a new user, 
I'd worry about the confusion that would be created when the new user 
finally learns the new masked syntax and then wants to graduate out of 
the admin window, wants to inspect another theme, reads a tutorial 
written somewhere or otherwise encounters <?php ?> and now has to go 
reconcile the masking system you've gone and implemented.

Would the confusion or intimidation presented by two "different" 
template syntaxes be better or worse then the current intimidation 
issues you're trying to solve?

+1.  This would have the advantage of tailoring individual plugins to
each one of the indefinitely large set of templating systems.

In  the  mean time, one safe(r) approach might be to chmod  600  edit.php
whenever you do not modify content. This will have future cracking attem-
pts  logged  (unlike   IP-based banishment) and  prevent your  site  from
being defaced.

I  believe  it's  a  distribution  rather  than  a  list.  An  E-mail   to
security@wordpress.org will reach Matt, Ryan and the others, once there is
proof  to suggest a threat has become concrete. Possibilities to confute a
hole  as  it  stands: weak admin password;  code  modification  (including
plug-ins);   packet  sniffing/interception  that  led  to  content   being
injected.

Why would they have to read both? Like Matt said, this is JUST FOR THE 
ADMIN TEMPLATE EDITOR. It just means that people who are uncomfortable 
with editing PHP and uploading files (the same people the editor was 
created for) will have an even easier job of modifying and indeed 
understanding their themes' code.

I'm with Matt 110% on this one. From the earliest days of WordPress, I
recall hearing "I'd love to use WP, but it looks so complicated because of
the PHP. I'm not a programmer, so I'll find something else to use." on the
forums and everywhere else. I used to reply on a daily basis "I'm not a
programmer either, and look what I've done."

Many responses in this thread have been all about those who are code-savvy.
I suggest you put on your casual user hats and then think about this.

This initiative would be a huge step forward in embracing the many WP users
who would like to do more with the application but are saddled with
misconceptions about PHP. There are far more people in this category of
users than in the hacker category.

This is a gross over-simplification of the issue at hand. As much as you
coders know and understand PHP to be among the simplest of codebases, it's
not just about the <?php ?>. Does anyone hear recall the GET versus POST
debate in recent threads? Hand that discussion over to a new user and pat
them on the back of the hand saying "there there, don't worry. PHP is
drop-dead easy."

I don't see much difference between this initiative and localization; it's a
way to provide some functionality to a broader audience.

But its not JUST the admin template editor that is impacted and its not 
JUST those who are comfortable with PHP that might need to be 
"bilingual" as I mentioned in my other post this morning. You also have 
to reconcile the differences between the 2 syntaxes in the minds of a 
user when dealing with things like:

* documentation
* tutorials
* learning by opening up and examining other templates
* people on forums and mailing lists and answering peoples questions

This isn't an obstacle that cannot be overcome, but its one that 
neither applications that use templating logic front to back, nor ones 
that don't use them anywhere have to deal with.

Since you're trying to solve the new user "problem" the question as I 
see it has to be do you gain enough by pushing this conflict further 
down the line for someone learning WordPress to make the switch from 
where you're at now worth any of the other logistical headaches.

Regardless on whether or not I think this should be done, how much of
a templating language PHP is and is not, and how silly I think it is
arguing over this, especially on the recommendation of it being a
plugin, here's how it could (and probably should) be done, whether in
a plugin or in the core [begin flames upon me here].

First thing is file concatenation. If we're going to do this as a
system like this, we should let them select front page view, single
page view, etc. and make it all one file, instead of trying to split
out headers, because inevitably people will want to do something
different with it, and if anything, we shouldn't be approving the use
of <ifsinglepage><someothertag></ifsinglepage>, so let's keep them all
in one file. For when editing existing themes, we should concatenate
all the associated files for each view.

Second thing is parsing. Lucky for us, the PHP guys have made this
easy for us, and given us access to Zend's lexical scanner and
tokenizer from PHP userspace. The downside is for us linux users, its
disabled by default as of 4.3, this is something whoever does this
will have to work around (I declare thee the dumbest person ever if
you run off to try to write a lexical PHP scanner in PHP). On the
bright side, its built in for all windows versions to date. [1]

So, the suggested method here is using token_get_all() and taking
advantage of the lexical scanner. While looping over, you output any
inline HTML, you replace any specific PHP blocks that you want with
HTML. Easy as pie, really.

The hard part is going from whatever desired format(s) you want back
to PHP. This pretty much could be left to the imagination of the
person writing this, as a proper parser for this probably has to be
created from scratch, have fun with preg_match. For someone
sufficiently skilled, I doubt this is a problem, for half the people
spouting off on this discussion today, well, I'll be nice.

[1] http://php.net/ref.tokenizer


On a related note, Matt, have you thought about looking into Savant's
(http://phpsavant.com) scripts and classes for cleaning PHP for
templates? From what I understand, its designed and does a decent job
at what it does, and would probably be something very useful to WP.com
if its as good as I've heard it is.

This isn't just about new users. I've been using WP since late 2003 and I am
barely more PHP-savvy now than I was then. This isn't about learning WP
itself, either. This is about providing opportunities for users that current
don't exist.

One obvious downside to this that I can see is that people will begin
clamoring for the ability to code theme files OFFLINE using the
templating vernacular, meaning that there wouldn't just be a need for an
editor plugin but also a theme loading mechanism that would take the
templates and transform them into valid WP-isms on the server side.

If we're providing hooks for plugin authors to use, then this side of
the equation also needs to be considered.  I can think of quite a few
Movable Type users that would love to be able to take their old MT
styles and just load 'em into WP without having to learn WP Template Tags.

Of course its an over-simplification of the issue due to lazyness on a 
mailing list, but at the same time its not. Telling someone that the 
templates use "PHP" brings a log of baggage from their own concepts of 
what PHP is. even if you're using the most limited subset of the 
language to get basic templates working its all that other mess that 
people may have run into in the past that makes people more intimidated 
then they maybe ought to be.

But I stand by my other comments that I just don't know that the 
alternative being presented resolves enough of the complexity or 
groking issues without raising a brand new pile of issues that make 
things seem overly complicated when people are tasked with explaining 
how to use WordPress.

Its different in that the system being proposed causes the need to 
reconcile the 2 views on the same thing at various stages in the 
learning process and the accessibility gained up front isn't 
necessarily a zero some game.

My $0.02 on this:

- Perception is reality.  If people _think_ it's hard, it is an issue.
Regardless of what we programmers think.  This is as much a marketing
issue as anything else.  If one can remove a barrier to entry for people
to adopt WP, it should be done.  We all want WP to rule the world, no?

- It just needs to be a front end, and having it be multi-lingual makes
it wonderful.  Matt's idea that it xlates into PHP for storage/execution
is perfect.

- Document what you want, it's not like the codex is a PHP tutorial
today... If you started with a "clean slate" it might be easier to
document the 30 or so tags that would be required to get a basic
template off the ground.

- Sure it can be a plug-in, but how about making one chosen version of
it be a plug-in that ships "in the box" and maybe even is enabled at the
time of install?  That way a person coming from another system can only
enable theirs, and your "geek" can disable it altogether.

- This seems like a total win-win: "get the most powerful and flexible
template system in the world, and for you geeks, drop down into PHP
whenever you need to".

At the risk of dragging this back and forth on I think the two of us 
are /almost/ talking about two different things here.

As I read Matt's earlier proposal he would just be creating a view or a 
mask over the template files via regexes or some other mechainism to 
mask some of the uglyness of PHP syntax and some of the initial 
intimidation factor of the "the templates are in PHP" statement.

To me this would approach would change little about the "code" the user 
really has to write to get things to work in those templates. They 
still would have to know all about loops and queries (or objects if 
some of that gets sufficiently obscured) and all the other stuff that 
one must develop in order to make a template function. I didn't see 
much proposed that would abstract those concepts into something easier 
to digest in a way that's typical of full blown template languages.

But maybe I'm mistaken and I'm not reading enough into the vision.

I can spot an MT powered site easier than some using WP.

This isn't about "look". Again, another gross misunderstanding of the
core issue from someone close to the heart of Wordpress. There have
been lots of good, valid, sensible opinions expressed here (including
some in that vast tome of mine that appears to have been ignored,
alas).

It's not about competing with MT. It's not just about new users. It's
not just about <?php foo(); ?>. It's about the fundamentals of how the
app should template itself, and the various philosophies wrestling
within.

Much of HOW WP has developed over the past n years is down to the fact
its templates have all been inline PHP. Look at the plugin
architecture! Look at the Loop, the single most incomprehensible thing
to anyone coming from any other system! These things are MAJOR and
shouldn't be flippantly dismissed, as usual, as "we're fine as we
are/why change?" (cf the whole documentation issue).

Seriously, Podz, get a grip of the conversation thread.

So sorry, I shouldn't have thrown in the last line. But you can see my

I think this thread has reached a standstill, as has happened to so
many others, so here's my suggestion for anyone that feels strongly
enough about this being a good idea.

1) Write code, you're not convincing anyone otherwise. A way to
implement it has been displayed, if you want it, write it yourself,
instead of flaming the other side incessantly until this thread
eventually dies off. Hell, get a team of you together to write it if
you must.
2) Display the code to the public, take a poll on the people using it,
keep track of how many people download it, survey people on if it was
their reason for making the switch.
3) Present your data.

For the other side, who thinks this is a silly idea.

1) Sit back, relax, let them keep rambling, and maybe someone will write code.
2) If your thoughts are corect, even when they write the code,
adoption will be slow, they'll have wasted their own time writing it.
Fine, problem solved, you didn't waste your time flaming them to
kingdom come.
3) "I told you so." if it'll please your hearts and heads.

I can, yes :)
I can see certain points but equally I cannot see others.
As a user - not as coder / supporter or anything else - if <~listcats~> 
can list my cats just how I want, wonderful. But given that if I want 
different from the standard that I will somehow have to dig into 
something approaching code then as a user it does me little favour.

Example code from my sidebar:
<?php get_linksbyname('Reading', '<li>', '</li>', '', FALSE, 'rand', 
FALSE, FALSE, 12, FALSE); ?>
How can that be done by a template tag? Unless somewhere else you want 
me to edit those preferences into a tag and in such case the tag becomes 
as much an obstacle as the original code.

Template tag the sidebar of the default theme. Make that more readable, 
more useful and more customisable for the default user?

I do get your point about MT / WP and what goes on underneath and that 
this is an issue beyond aesthetics - my point was that if MT has had 
tags for longer and they have not used that power then is that a model 
WP should follow? Arguably yes because WP leads but tag creation is one 
thing and making them usable to your average blogger is something 
entirely different.

And from what I understand if
<?php get_linksbyname('Reading', '<li>', '</li>', '', FALSE, 'rand', 
FALSE, FALSE, 12, FALSE); ?>
takes a certain amount of time to execute, adding a template tag before 
that just increases that time?

OK, so template tags CAN have parameters. To crib from MT, here's some
pseudo-markup:

<$getlinks name="Reading" before="<li>" after="</li>" order="random"$>

The overhead for translating that to your php is minimal. And, you'll
notice, it's more characters. It's also more immediately
understandable - the attribute AND value are in the tag. I hate having
to remember what all the parameters are for each wp function as it
stands :)

So it's not necessarily about making everything into single-word tags.
MT, like Blogger before it, puts attributes into its tags to alter
default values.

By displaying attributes within the tag, it becomes self-documenting,
more immediately hackable for a new user, or and old user who's
forgotten the order parameters go in. And, of course, in a tag like
that, the order of parameters should be irrelevant :)

See these:

http://meidell.dk/files/easytags.phps

If you add code to simulate a Loop and a few of the other wp_*() 
functions, it would be complete.  The complaint Brian has about it being 
kind of useless is less true now that WP includes those non-echo 
functions.  Read my comment on his post, which I wrote way back when.

The code is online, the survey is... incomplete.

I guess this wasn't adopted.  It's been almost two years.  I'm pretty 
sure that if we're able to search back through wp-hackers records we 
would see this plugin mentioned, so it's not as if it was obscure.

Is it premature to say "I told you so" right now, or should I wait a 
bit?  ;)

Incidentally, it struck me that someone could write an interop 
functions.php that let you drop theme files from another system (say, 
MT) into a theme directory, and then use magic to convert the MT theme 
tags into WP PHP templates on demand.

The reason is also a known problem - you simply didn't bother to read
what I wrote. I'm not trying to achieve anything. Matt and the WordPress
developers are.

Help yourself out. Engage your brain before whining at me, please.

I finally wrote this long-awaited feature while on the plane from Dublin 
to Atlanta. It's in "works for me" stage, but I think it could use a ton 
of testing and ideas.

The goals? An easy way to move pages, posts, comments, and postmeta 
between WordPress blogs without doing a lossy export to the MT format 
and back.

It uses RSS2 + a made up wp: namespace. I basically just mapped fields 
in our DB to XML.

Import has been moved under "manage" since it's really not a top-level 
priority, and there is now an "export" submenu which downloads the XML 
export of your blog. WordPress is now an option under importing.

I'd love for people to bang on this, try to break it, see how big a blog 
they can test it on, and generally kick the tires.

Still deciding on the name...

This just gave me an idea: It'd be super neat to scan the file people 
are editing through the web form and link to documentation for the 
different functions used in a sidebar or in the footer of the page.

See reference page for: the_content, WP Loop, get_header.

Hopefully they would be alike enough that if you know one you pretty 
much know another, it's just a different syntactical sugar around the meat.

That'd be dumb (no offense). As others have pointed out in this
thread, you do this for the theme editor, you're going to have to do
it for everything. People are going to move from the theme editor to
text editors. Then, they're going to use the easy tags in the text
editors, thinking, "Hey, it works in the theme editor, it should work
here," and then they find they're flat-out wrong. Then it hits the
support forums... and I can just imagine you saying "Oops" now.

How about wrapping the transformation for easy access by external editors?
Put in a big link to "Edit in another tool" that spawns the appropriate
interfaces.  Could be as simple as textareas for copy/paste or a full-blown
set of APIs.  Shouldn't be too hard.

Long-awaited. Long-needed. Great job :)

Can we get http://automattic.com/there.is.only.wp as the namespace
identifier ? la XUL? :)

I think this "tricked-out front end" idea is really quite nice. But I
take your point, people are going to get used to the paradigm and
expect it to work everywhere. So lets distance ourselves from the
run-of-the-mill text editors. Perhaps put a red box around our
<wp:loop> tags. Use drag-drop to insert them instead of typing it in.
Stuff like that.

Message-ID: <20060511023302.GC6731@iki.fi>

Just thought I'll let you know of a problem I encountered on my blog
this morning.

Alarmingly I noticed my pages "archives" and "links" stopped working.
404s were displayed.

Of course, I didn't notice this in the logs as everything is reported as
200 OK.

I created a test page with the same template as archives and it worked.
Mysterious! So to fix the problem I deleted "archives" and "links"
pages, then recreated them.

I have no idea how I should debug why they stopped working. I haven't
changed anything for ages.

Can I at least suggest proper 404 reporting?

Eric, WordPress 1.5 (and even 1.5.2) has security issues that could  
allow someone to change your WP password without your knowledge.

Did you just go into WordPress and change the password, or did you  
log out and see if the password had been changed?  See, the way one  
of the attacks works (the one I'm thinking it could have been), is  
that you are tricked into visiting a page that uses devious methods  
to submit a form (on your behalf, using your WP cookie) that changes  
your password.  If done right, you won't even realize this has  
happened because your WP login cookie will be updated with the hash  
of the new password, and so your access to your blog won't be  
interrupted.  It is possible that this happened, and that when you  
changed your password, you weren't changing it from what you  
thought... it may have already been changed without your knowledge.

Grep your access log for all POSTs to /wp-admin/profile.php ... note  
that the IP you'll be looking for is your own, but the referer will  
be blank or from an external site.

Something like:

grep -i 'POST /eric/thoughts/wp-admin/profile\.php' access_log

Or, maybe you picked a relatively simple password and they guessed  
it... but that'd definitely show up in the logs as suspicious.  What  
I'd recommend doing immediately is upgrading to http:// 
svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/1.5/  This has several CSF  
fixes, and will at least prevent people from being able to just  
change your password.  Long term, I'd start looking into upgrading to  
the 2.0 branch.

Let's not brush this aside.  If we have a checkbox that claims to  
offer people a private WP install, that should extend to all aspects  
of the install, including feeds.

And whilst you're doing that, ask yourself why someone dedicated
enough to Wordpress to produce lucid, clear, useful documentation
(which that most definitely is) would publish it on *their own blog*
instead of thinking "I know, this should go in the Codex". Because
that's rather telling.

Re: tags only appearing in the editor, not in the file: I'd argue
that's a crazy idea, and would lead to ropey parsing and very slow
parsing quite fast. I think the "easy" moniker is, as many have said,
misguided. This conversation for me is about overhauling the
templating syntax, not providing a different perspective on it.

Looks like I missed most of the fun, but here's my belated take.

As far as advancing the ability of "Joe Blogger" to edit his  
templates, this has a very limited benefit.  That is, it might give  
someone the courage to edit their template a little bit... move  
things around... but eventually (and I'd guess sooner rather than  
later) they're going to hit the wall in terms of exhausting the  
capabilities of this easytags system.  I ran into that with  
MovableType back in the day.  I couldn't manipulate the data the way  
I wanted using the template tags alone.  So I learned PHP and just  
used the MT tags to feed info to PHP so it could do the real work.   
e.g. <?php $title = '<$MTEntryTitle encode_php="q"$>'; ?>  Brad  
Choate was doing this back in 2002, actually feeding MT tags to PHP/ 
Smarty [1].

So the easytags syntax ends up having to be forsaken, and what do you  
know, they end up having to learn PHP anyway.

I'd rather that developer effort be put into helping to demystify the  
WordPress PHP tags, rather than leading users down a path that has no  
future and no outside application.

If we want to help users edit templates, and I think that we should,  
we should focus our efforts on making the PHP easier to work with,  
and easier to remember.  Heck, I have to look up function names all  
the time.  Is it get_the_permalink() or get_permalink() ?  Yeah, I'm  
wrong about half the time when I guess.  What would be fantastic is a  
build in JS-powered WordPress tag helper that could assist the theme  
editor, but using the real PHP, so that things observed and learned  
will have lasting value to the user.

I imagine it working like this: a sidebar pane, with several  
sections, most with dropdown select boxes.

What would you like to do?
[ Create a Post Loop ]
[ Insert a Tag in the loop ]
[ Insert a Tag somewhere else ]
[ Display a Bookmark list ]
[ Call another template ]

etc.

Upon selecting, they could be presented with other options, and at  
the end, they're given the code they need... sort of like when you're  
choosing your car's make, model, year, engine, color when you buy  
insurance online, or like when choosing a category on eBay.

e.g. Call another template => Which template would you like to  
include? (header, sidebar, footer, other |__________|) => Will this  
template be called multiple times? => CODE

Excuse an outsider butting in here but I've been watching this thread  
with interest as accessibility of software and code is close to my  
heart and after 25 years designing UI's and working with users I've  
learnt the hard way the huge gap between what a programmer expects  
users to understand and what your average 'Joe' can actually  
accommodate.

This is a great piece of documentation and yes - get it in the Codex.  
But it is still a blank as far as most users will be concerned and a  
long way from being the 'WordPress Templates for Dummies' that they  
really need. I would wager that a good 70%-80% don't want to learn  
php, html or css - or - actually don't have the capacity to learn -  
they just want simple building blocks and very simple, short,  
explanatory documentation.

As you watch the support forum, I often wonder how many users give up  
altogether or settle for something less than what they would like -  
because they are stunned into submission by the techie talk. I don't  
necessarily have solutions by the way, I just think that this thread  
is still pitching largely at users with some skill and knowledge  
potential and that is still the minority. The majority pick a theme,  
install some plugins and are terrified to get any closer.

Just my 2 cents worth.

It's not a tin-foil hat feature, someone can write a plugin for that. It 
merely adds noindex to pages, and turns of pinging. (Which some search 
engines consider an opt-in.) It's also not complete as until it supports 
robots.txt somehow it doesn't quite work, and we may consider removing 
it if we can't complete it.

Yep, and this is the space I see widgets and advanced web customizable 
themes filling.

Spectrum:
[ ryan boren ..... wp-hacker subscriber ..... hack and paste designer 
..... light template editor, for text and such ...... person who 
downloads and uploads themes and plugins ...... person who stays with 
default but uses the header color editor ...... person stays with 
kubrick blue ...... person to intimidated by WP to use it ]

Anyone remember how a big chunk of template compliants went down when we 
took internationalization out of the default theme? It was the exact 
same functionality, but the <?php _e(); ?> stuff around all the text 
scared the living daylight out of people.

You just described a pretty natural learning curve, which I don't think 
is a bad thing. As long as the curve is gentle and doesn't have any big 
jumps along the way, an interested person will be able to move up it to 
become better and better with the program they're using. This isn't a 
bad thing.

Here is a plugin I've been using since when the dashboard issue came up a while back. I just released it. It might do what u want...or it might not.

  Let's not brush this aside.  If we have a checkbox that claims to  
  offer people a private WP install, that should extend to all aspects  
  of the install, including feeds.

Just joined the mailing list and figured I would introduce myself.

My name is Dan Kuykendall, generally known as Seek3r Ive been doing PHP
development for about 8 years. I created the phpGroupWare project amoung
a few other smaller projects and currently have been working on a
WordPress plugin called podPress which adds full podcasting support to
WordPress.

http://www.mightyseek.com/podpress/

Ive been very happy with the design of wordpress and the great deal of
support for plugins and all the action and filter locations sprinkled
through the entire app.

Ive been able to accomplish quite a good deal of integration without
needing to modify the wordpress files, but as I get into certain
features its getting harder and harder. For example, I really wish there
was support for plugins to extend the categories page, which currently
has none, and the database is not setup to really support any additional
data.
Ive also had to create replacement versions of the wp-rss2.php,
wp-atom.php and wp-feeds.php to accomplish certain goals. On this Ive
been a little curious as to what the overall policy is for this kind of
thing. My changes can easily be integrated into wordpress and are not
limited in usefulness to just my plugin. Is there some way to offer up
tweaked versions of files to the developers in control, so that they
become part of the standard releases?

Yep. Create a ticket outlining what change you've made, then attach a

OK cool, Im going to get up to speed on trac over the weekend.
I already submitted on simple addition for adding a hook to the
wp-admin/categories.php where it displays the edit form.
There are hooks in the category create/edit/delete functions, but no
simple way to extend the categories edit page in which those other hooks
become really useful.

Thanks again for the pointer to trac, I will start making use of it and
be a good WP citizen

To  clarify in advance, this is a benign case of curiosity; not a rant.  I
have  been  meaning to ask this for a couple of month, but was too shy  to
say anything. Figures seem to indicate that, based on the (admittedly poor
indicator  which is) number of commits, WordPress changes less and less as
time  goes on. A decline from half a dozen commits per day to just 1 or  2
is noticeable.

With  all due disretion, I am not suggesting that there is something wrong
with  a  slower  pace  of  development,  but  is  there  perhaps  lack  of
inspiration?  The "good enough" syndrome is quite detrimental. I would  be
sad  to think that WordPress has become more static than it used to be, if
not  dormant (security/bug fixes cycle?). Sometimes I can't help but  feel
as  though attention and rigour have been shifted to wordpress.com and its
extension, figure-wise.

Could  it be time to radically extend and make WordPress an out-of-the-box
CMS?  Or maybe produce a separate, standalone package (a derivative)? Many
people  seek CMS software. They love WordPress for many reasons, but  they
eventually settle for something like Drupal. In newsgroups, I find it hard
to  convince people to use WordPress as a CMS. With the number of bloggers
exceeding  100 million quite soon, I suppose my point of contension  might
be void.

Sorry to be such a pain in the ass. I hope this doesn't upset anyone.

Best wishes,

Roy

No, no, and NO.
I don't need a "site-in-a-box" when I just want to write a little bit.

I think this view is based on only the relatively small subset of time
you have watched commits. Every few months, after a major stable
release has been out a while and some of the larger features for the
next release have been started, commits slowly trickle down. Following
this period of slowness, usually comes a burst of activity directly
prior to a release. After the release is a second burst of activity,
fixing all the bugs in the prior release, and after that's taken care
of, is one last burst of activity on the new branch with all the new
features that have been enqueue during the test-release-fix cycles.
Following that, we're where we are right now, in the lull between two
releases.

I look at this as the sign of a fairly mature and stable application.  
If what your customer base needs is a mousetrap, you build a  
mousetrap. It might take quite a few iterations to find a mousetrap  
that reliably traps mice, but once it does trap mice reliably and  
effectively to the general satisfaction of the customer, you don't  
necessarily need to build a better one - just fine-tune the existing  
one. Then it's time to look for the customers who need something  
slightly different - like a web-based mousetrap - and work on  
building their mousetrap instead.

Or, put another way, imagine how much more efficient Microsoft Word  
would be if it was just a word processor, and not a word processor /  
html editor / brochure maker / family medical database creator /  
template dumping bin.

I think you're having trouble convincing folks to use Wordpress as a  
CMS because it isn't a CMS. Since I don't need a CMS for my site, I'd  
personally prefer that Wordpress stay as it is - a very functional  
blogging tool.

If you think there's a significant customer base for a mouse- 
management system instead of just a mousetrap, where the reason for  
use is significantly different than Wordpress as it currently stands,  
I'd think that would be a sufficient reason to branch the code and  
produce Wordpress CMS. I'm usually one who thinks "plugin" before  
"branch" but if you're significantly changing the basic functionality  
of the application then it's not really Wordpress anymore, and the  
code should reflect that.

Indeed.  While the blogging space is still evolving, it is quite natural
that the pace of development should be slowing down by now.  There just
isn't as much that needs doing as there used to be.

Exactly.  Software that tries to be all things to all people almost
always ends up bloated, buggy, and insecure.

It should be noted however, that there are people working on integrating
WordPress with CMSes, such as Joomla, and I think if that can be done
cleanly, that makes more sense than "spoiling" an excellent blogging
tool, by twisting it into something else.

Whilst this is true, the pace of actual development does seem to have 
slowed slightly. As in, there have been tickets that have been marked 
for committing but haven't been committed, as well as tickets that were 
being actively developed that have just stopped being worked on - and 
that's just out of the tickets that I've been watching. Seems a bit weird.

It's my impression that Matt, at the very least, has been traveling
extensively recently.  Photomatt.net seems to back that up.  A bit hard
to pay attention to svn commits when on the road, IMNSHO.

I appreciate that, but it doesn't make sense to have WordPress suffer as 
a result. Why not give a couple more people commit privileges? There are 
lots of people that are more than trustworthy enough for the job (Mark, 
David, Andy, Owen etc).

We've been down that road more than a few times in the past.  svn commit
access is what it is at the moment, unfortunately.

Just because a ticket is marked for committing doesn't necessarily mean 
it's ready to be committed, it's just a flag. I'll try to be more 
diligent about removing the tag when I think something needs more work.

It just seems like the quality control is done at the gardener level, 
and the actual committing is just a formality which is hindered by the 
lack of people with SVN commit access. I might be totally off the mark, 
though, since I'm obviously not absolutely familiar with the inner workings.

I think the raw numbers may be misleading. We used to commit thing 
willy-nilly, often with typos that would be caught minutes later or with 
obvious bug-fixes that went in a few hours later.

Now with our much more mature use of Trac, that sort of thing is much 
less common.

Two things to note:

Feature-wise, I think 2.1 is shaping up to be really kick-ass. We've got 
some absolutely killer things like spell check and XML import/export 
that have been on the TODO forever. To top it off, it's going to be 
faster and more secure than any previous WordPress, and it includes the 
work of more people.

Second, I think if you talk about the speed of development, you have to 
look at things outside of core commits that have happened in 2006:

* New logo and redesign of WordPress.org (and server move)
* Long-awaited forum improvements (bbPress)
* Tons of plugins, including some that might be core candidates
* New theme/plugin download infrastructure and stats
* Codex stability
* Making MU not such an ugly cousin

And yes, personally I have spent a fair amount of time on Akismet and 
WP.com development.

There are a lot of things that could be done on the code side to benefit 
the folks that help out on the forums and Codex every day, but there 
isn't a lot of overlap between those folks and the hackers.

When I look at things that need the most work, it's not the core code, 
it's in the support services around it.

* The forums need more luv
* Theme directory, download, discovery, update notification
* The same for plugins
* Dev blog posts
* Actually using our newsletter with 50k+ subscribers
* Internationalization of WP.org, forums, codex, etc
* Making documentation less verbose
* Support, support, support

I think what we do need is more people with commit to WordPress.org, as 
that'd benefit the community in a very direct way.

Good point.

Also, if anyone thinks a huge wave is passing us by, or there is some 
crucial bit of functionality we're missing in core, please speak up! (Or 
even better, code up.)

Proposal:

function insert($tbl, $hash){
	$fields = array_keys($hash);
	$this->query("INSERT INTO $tbl (`".implode('`,`',$fields)."`) VALUES 
('".implode("','",$hash)."')");
	return $this->insert_id;
}

function update($tbl, $hash, $where){
	$bits = array();
	foreach( array_keys($hash) as $k )
		$bits[] = "`$k`='$hash[$k]'";
	return $this->query("UPDATE $tbl SET ".implode(', ',$bits)." WHERE 
$where");
}

In the $wpdb object. We could also move all escaping to this level, but 
that's a separate issue.

It's a bit of code I got from Flickr Cal on something we collaborated 
on, I've been using it in another project and it feels clean.


$wpdb->insert( 'table', array( 'this' => 'that', 'and => 'another' ) );

$wpdb->update( $wpdb->posts, array( 'comment_count' => 0 ), "ID = $id");

We have been using wordpress extensively last few weeks for revamping our blogs and writing new plugins and a theme. In the process I found it useful to have a source code cross reference with annotation (commenting) capability. Here is my first iteration of the effort http://wordpress.taragana.net/

The code is updated from svn repository twice a day using cron jobs. We can make it more frequent like hourly if required.

Let me know if you find this useful.

I  appreciate your response, which was encouraging. As you rightly pointed
out,  I  have  been watching commits on a daily basis  _only  since  their
arrival_  as  mail digests. Trac likewise. I also did ponder these  points
which you alluded to.

Call  me  paranoid perhaps, but I dread see any project that I use (or  am
affiliated  with)  losing steam. It has happened several times before  and
the  cost  of  migrations,  time-wise, is high. I am  glad  to  hear  that
WordPress  does  not fall under this category, by any means.  (Bigger  and
better)^tm  things  always come in the way of the team, but I  think  it's
important  to  remember the origins of everything and the  community  that
very  much  depends  on the seminal word -- Wordpress in  this  particular
case.

Best wishes,

Roy

You'll probably also need a way to specify a table field filter to get 
rid of alien keys before the actual SQL insert or update statements are 
generated. For example, if a plugin tried something like this, you'd 
generate an error, unless you get rid of the bogus key first:

   $wpdb->update ( $wpdb->posts,
     array(post_title => "foo", kickme => "bar"),
     "ID = $id" );

We'd probably want a core function that could be used to register the 
canonical list of valid fields for a table. Off the top of my head, 
something like:

   $wpdb->def_table_fields( $wpdb->usermeta,
     array('umeta_id', 'user_id', 'meta_key', 'meta_value') );

If you really wanted to get fancy-schmancy, you could make it a hash 
where the values represent some basic data types (string, int, datetime, 
etc), for automagical validation. And we'd want to have filters that 
allow plugins to modify this info, as well.

Well,  this mousetrap, being an excellent simplification/exemplary, serves
as  defence for one side of the argument. In this case, it could  actually
defend  the state of development being idle (which it is *not* in the case
of  WordPress).  They say that your competitor is always up to  something,
never  sleeping  and only scheming to snatch a piece of your pie.  Let  us
face  it:  There are other packages out there are they stride forward,  as
well.

The  key  to  staying ahead is to innovate rather than add  features  that
complement and complete the feature set of all your competitors (I dislike
this term in the context of FOSS). Thus, I think that WordPress could seek
to  extract  new  ideas.  Widgets, automatic  saving,  spellchecking,  and
WYSIWYG  front-end  already  exist elsewhere (by no means do I  intend  to
detract  from  the  wonderful  implementation). Bug  bounty  hunt  can  be
fruitful,  but  perhaps on par with the fruits of a hunt for ideas,  which
require more than various hooks.

Despite  my  apathy for Word (I am a prolific Linux advocate in  fact),  I
don't  think  that  feature depletion would have had any merit.  It  is  a
mature product that continues to extend and gives OpenOffice a run for its
money, piracy factors aside.

Me  too, but it is sometimes difficult to teach an old dog some new tricks
(pardon  the  phrase,  it's a proverb). I would rather let someone  use  a
package that s/he is already familiar with.

Yes,   I  am  aware  of  some  packages  that  integrate  a  plethora   of
sub-packages,  WordPress included. They are poorly tested and they  suffer
from  the  same issues of lesser-known Linux distributions --  principally
patching  and conflict resolvation. No doubt complexity and bloat can take
any  project  down the wrong line. However, novelty needn't  /necessarily/
carry a penalty.

Allow  me to apologise for generating so much 'noise'. It wasn't at all my

I  am  pleased to hear this. I was looking at the scale of changes  before
making any hasty assumptions. I understand that I am right in pointing out
that the extent of changes /may/ have been reduced, yet I was gauging this
at  the wrong 'season', as well as by the wrong criteria. It makes perfect
sense now.

That's  perfectly acceptable. By no means did I criticise. I wish you  the

I presume  that going  down  the  'Mozilla route' is out   of the question
entirely.  I  would not mind to be proven wrong *smile*. In the long  run,
everyone benefits.

Message-ID: <028101c67857$f81d8590$02001aac@CPQSATYAM>

Hi everybody

I was modifying a plug-in I'm using and was about to add a function that I 
have been dragging from several languages I've used over the years.  Since 
the function is of general use, I thought it might as well be put into the 
core of WordPress, so I decided to enter this list and offer it and request 
comments and ask for guidance on how to submit it for review

It can be added easily and harmlessly to the method query without even 
breaking existing code.

It is a sort of sprintf() but oriented to SQL.  As with sprintf, if it has 
no %placeholder, it returns the same string, thus it can be inserted into 
wpdb::query without breaking anything.   Since % is a valid operator in SQL, 
I used ?, which is not.

The following:

echo BuildSql('Insert into ?ttable 
(?s,?ns,?mi,?d,?ni,?i)','Something','',5,time(),0,null);

echoes:

 Insert into wp_table ('Something',null,5,'2006-05-15',null,0)

Notice the ?t placeholder in front ot table.  The ?t placeholder is replaced 
by the contents of global variable $table_prefix, strings are escaped and 
quoted, dates are put into SQL standard format ints, floats and booleans are 
actually evaluated so that there cannot be any unexpected things injected.

The piece of code is not long, buy I am hesitant to include it in this 
message or attach it since I am not familiar with the ways of this list. 
The code is commented and has phpdocumentor comments at the top.  Can anyone 
guide me on how (and where, if not here) to offer it for comments?

Thanks

Satyam

Whenever Matt feels like it, Atom 1.0 has been available via patches
on trac since before it was even finalized, so your best bet is to ask
Matt when he wants to let it in.

I've also often thought of the exact same thing, and then a more
pluggable wpdb object to allow a simple form of database abstraction
for inserts and selects.

I don't see the need, before we were allowed to insert any SQL we
wanted, why would we try to work around a non-existant stupidity in
developers? Plus, this could yield unexpected results, like if we
assumed that it was safe to discard the information, at that point,
the developer thinks their information was inserted and can therefore
be selected. We need errors, they were made for a reason.

Message-ID: <703A2748-3DEF-4FF6-88C1-265CBEC0A49C@codehooligans.com>

Greeting all,

I have a client using WP 2.0.2. They seems to really like the concept  
of Pages for creating somewhat static content and controlling the  
page slug. They like WP Pages  so much they called me last week with  
a problem. Seems they have over 100 pages with 5 levels of nesting.  
These of course all list on a single page when the editor navigates  
to the edit-pages.php page. They requested I provide some hack to  
filter the listing or provide some paging process to limit the  
display to 20-30 Pages at a time. Not that they have a slow server or  
database. I logged in with my admin-level account and it took close  
to 15 second for the page to finish loading.

On another client project I've been playing around with some AJAX  
Tree view controls for remote server-side directory browsing. I was  
thinking I could modify edit-pages.php to provide the display of the  
parent-child nodes via a tree view. This should be pretty simple to  
implement. As an extra step I'd like to allow the user to drag and  
drop a node/item which would in effect change the post_parent value  
in WP.

Just wondering if the end result would be useful to anyone else. I've  
been looking for some admin plugins or listing of admin area filters  
or hooks. This area seems totally vacant. So far I've only found the  
admin OS X template skin which is not nearly what I need.

	project
Message-ID: <Pine.BSO.4.62.0605151721380.23862@ludlow.scs.cs.nyu.edu>

Hello,

I'm the author of CoralCDN ("Coral Cache"); I know some members of the 
blogging community have used it to offload their content when they 
otherwise would have been overwhelmed by requests.  More recently, we've 
begun a network measurement project for which we are looking for help:

   http://illuminati.coralcdn.org/

This project seeks to grapple with a number of questions about Internet 
and Web client populations and deployments that have been difficult to 
answer up 'til now, including things like:

   1. What is the distance between clients and their DNS resolvers?

   2. How suboptimal (in terms of network distance) are clients' use of
      web proxies?

   3. What do client populations behind NATs and web proxies look like?

   4. How effective is blacklisting/whitelisting IPs for admissions control
      to websites?  What additional information can be applied to make
      these approaches more effective?

This is an academic endeavour; while our results will be submitted to a 
refereed conference, all identifying information will be kept private and 
only released in anonymized or aggregate form. Some of our preliminary 
data can be found at:

   http://illuminati.coralcdn.org/stats/

While most of our measurements are done using CoralCDN, we are also asking 
web site operators to add 2 lines of HTML to their pages in order to 
contribute. We'll even track your individual team's contributions and how 
you rank against others (a la SETI@Home).

   http://illuminati.coralcdn.org/teams/

Now, to get to the reason I've emailed this list.  Dan Sandler recently 
developed a WordPress plugin to make it really easy to integrate 
illuminati into WordPress blogs.  It can be found here:

   http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dsandler/hacks/illuminati/

I hope it isn't an inappropriate use of this list to announce this plugin; 
we'd like to welcome people to install it and give illuminati a whirl.

Thanks,
Mike Freedman

This was mentioned by Matt and I also had the idea of a nested tree view 
[1] but never got round to coding anything up. If you do, post it up on 
that Trac ticket :)

We use inline annotations extensively in bioinformatics to annotate sequence. It is the same reason blogs are useful. Also you can find it in php.net or mysql documentation. It helps people write about their experience with the function / code and hopefully add some valuable documentation and explanations. 


BTW: One of the problems I faced with wordpress in the beginning was finding the "map of the cat" (as Dr. Feynman said) - the exact sequence of events and magic.

I recently posted some of my cross-reference efforts on my blog, and I 
don't expect everyone to have read that, so I'll re-post some details here:

Trunk XRef: http://redalt.com/xref
2.0 branch XRef: http://redalt.com/xref20
1.5.2 branch XRef: http://redalt.com/xref152

Editable function reference: http://redalt.com/fn/

The original post: http://asymptomatic.net/articles/2347.htm

Nothing I've written allows anonymous comments on any page of the XRef, 
though I wonder how that would be used effectively.

Hi,

is the following a desired feature:

If you enter a comment (as normal user not a logged in one) and you enter:
one < two
only "one" is displayed. I think the whole comment should be displayed.
Is this a bug or did I overlook something?

cheers

Thanks. I too tried my hand at it Atom 0.3 -> 1.0 conversation.

Few problems I tried to solve were:
1. Generating proper guid for items following diveintomark's suggestion
2. Generating proper urn's for blog id.
3. Converting categories from dc:subject (dublin core spec) to proper atom categories.
4. Few other misc items essentially to not only ensure full compliance with spec (validated) but also to pass as much information as available.

I am planning to do one of the following:
1. Provide a patch for WP core, if Matt & Co. are comfortable integrating it.
2. Release it as a patch / plugin under GPL

Looking for your thoughts / suggestions / procedure guidance.

Best,
Angsuman

So, Matt, the Shuttle fellas are making some bold statements in re:
Shuttle being included in the WP core "in due course".  What do we (as
WP hackers) need to do to get that process moving?  The mockups all lay
claim to WordPress 2.1, but that seems a mite ambitious. I'd love for it
to be the case, though - it really puts a very professional sheen on the
WP admin interface and brings it into rough parity with MT, IMNSHO.

The mockups are there - when can we start coding?

(For those not in the know, Shuttle is a semi-official revamp of the
backend admin interface - http://www.brokenkode.com/shuttle)

It's my contention that one of Michael's plugins may be causing this
behavior.

In any event, this is decidedly NOT wp-hackers material.  I'd rate it

Michael:
Please address these sorts of questions in the WP support forums.  I
think we've spilt a bit too much virtual ink on the issue at this point.

I don't think it's a 'throw-twenty-coding-monkeys' at it type of thing. 
There is a set of JPGs, that's what I have, you can download them from 
the website.

/me scratches head

Khaled seemed to indicate there were PSDs involved, not just JPEGs.
Additionally, what website are you referring to in re: acquisition of
said images?

It also looks as if some of the Fam Fam Silk icon set might be in play,
albeit in a slightly palette-swapped fasion...

KSES was my first guess, also. It's probably interpreting it as a 
non-safe tag. This could probably be fixed with a simple plugin that did 
something like...

   function escape_lt($text) {
     $text = preg_replace('/<((?![a-zA-Z]))/', '&lt;$1', $text);
     return $text;
   }

   // Add filter at priority 9, so it runs before KSES
   add_filter('pre_comment_content', 'escape_lt', 9);

That should escape any stand-alone '<' characters (which aren't part of 
tags) before KSES sees them.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Regular expression bug in sanitize_user?
Message-ID: <8BAFDC0B-8CBF-49B9-853B-1BAAB5807CDC@kavi.com>

Hello everyone,

I think I may have found a bug in the sanitize_user function in  
functions-formatting.php. Currently, lines 275 - 277 read:

// If strict, reduce to ASCII for max portability.
if ( $strict )
	$username = preg_replace('|[^a-z0-9 _.-@]|i', '', $username);

It appears that what this is trying to do is allow hyphens (along  
with many other characters). However, the regex does not match the  
hyphens. I believe the reg ex needs a back slash like this:

	$username = preg_replace('|[^a-z0-9 _.\-@]|i', '', $username);

Per the directions on the wordpress site about submitting bugs, I  
decided to ask here first before submitting this to the bug tracking  
system. Am I missing something here, or is this a mistake in the regex?

Thank You,

Jason

Surely after the time and effort they've put in the designers involved
would provide their designs in a non-lossy format?!
The ability to hide layers also tends to speed up the process when
slicing+dicing for CSS (IMNSHO ;p)

As I've already stated to Matt via email, I'll happily put my hand up
to join the team that's going to make this happen.

Considering the massive revamp in the Admin, would this also be a good
time to look at converting much of WP Admin's JS to use the prototype
library?

Hi!


I made some minor changes to the WordPress 2.0.2 core. The changes are:

Mostly I added some filters to allow the Polyglot plug-in to translate
everything that is displayed.

Since I'm new to the wp-hackers mailing list, I have one question. Who,
where or how do I submit a patch with changes and the detailed description
of the proposed changes?


Sincerely,

Simon Rozman

Message-ID: <70055a110605171242i4af183efv58f234d50d4e1381@mail.gmail.com>

I'm new to wordpress development. Surprise that the mailing list archive is
not searchable.  I did search in docs and support forum, but could not find
much about any feature that supports the emerging semantic web.

I have been engaged in W3C's semantic web interest groups concerning life
sciences.  There are lots of research activities going on in the areas of
ontology and its applications in semantic web.  I see a need for a
user-friendly publishing tool for general users to publish data in ontology
or rdf. (Ontology editor is more for specialist, I think)  After comparing a
host of wiki tools and blog tools, I think Wordpress is a better platform to
implement features supporting semantic web development. I saw lots of
discussions on another thread concerning development slow down. I guess
semantic web may be one place to find new trend/opportunity.

Did anybody implement a plugin for supporting any ontology or rdf? I know
RSS1.0 is in rdf. Because there are lots of ontologies and they keep
evolving, I would like to know if wordpress is easy to be extended to
support one specific ontology today but also many new ontologies as the
semantic web advances.  Do you think anything is needed to add to the core
code or simply adding new plugins is sufficient?

The features I have in mind will include:
- GUI editor with multiple input fields
- save/export input data in RDF/ontology
- organizing data by categories

Any comment is welcome.

Wow, it's great to see that the polyglot plugin is still moving forward! I 
know at least two projects at ibiblio (one of which is icommons.org) that 
are yearning for such a system.

There are psd's which Matt has last time I checked.  If he doesn't one could
easily contact Khaled who has them all as well.

I look forward to seeing what the community can do now that we (being the

Hi wp-hackers,
cc: Erwan, Flock blogging current owner

Blog posts sent using the version of Flock in development [1] to
wordpress.com strip images [2]. I am guessing this is not a wp.com
specific issue, and that the latest, developer versions of wp also
exhibit this.

The problem is not exhibited with Wordpress 2.0.2 self hosted.

We have not been able to figure out the cause of the problem, could you help?

My guess is it relates to Flock not putting a space before closing the
image tag. The developer writes "that's what's generated by Mozilla's
serializer and I'm pretty sure it's valid XML (and valid XHTML) with
or without the space."

If it's not occurring with self-hosted, you'll likely need to take this up 
with Matt (or whomever else/additional is running wp.com...) as I believe 
it's a quite-customized WPMU installation.  You could try a recent WPMU 
build and try to repro.  But in either case, neither wp.com nor WPMU are 
part of this list (someone correct me if I'm wrong! ;) ).

I would have to agree that whitespace should be ignored by any proper 
parser, and I myself add a space when I'm putting self-closing IMG tags in 
html for better legibility (at least to me...).

Message-ID: <446BF923.1010801@viper007bond.com>

So I guess my previous e-mail didn't come through, but that's okay as I 
figured it out anyway.

When you make a new top-level menu (yes, I'm sure I really need one) and 
then another page as a submenu under it, a submenu is also made with the 
title of the top-level menu. I didn't want that.

So, I thought I'd share the code I came up with:

Enjoy and feel free to provide improvement suggestions. :)

I was hoping someone could at least confirm that it is not in head WP?

If this is not a good list for MPMU, I would recommend someone with
the know update
http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists to direct people explicitly.
Also, equivalent info on an appropriate http://mu.wordpress.org/ page.

The   archive  are  an  (static)  automatic  dump  from  mailman.   Unlike
dababase-bound   content,  you  can't  query  for  fresh  content  without
indexing. Use the following syntax in Yahoo or Google:

site:lists.automattic.com <search-phrase>

Alternatively, "wp-forums" or "wp-hackers" are unique enough to be used as
search terms, along with your search phrase.

There  are  plugins (Dougal's I believe) which handles metadata and  while
it's not truly semantics, let's not forget about microformats such as XFN,
which WordPress has incoroporated in its core.

Only  as a specialised tool, in my humble opinion. The Joe Average blogger
is  neither  prepared nor willing to embed semantics. Most people  I  know
still  use editors such as Word, which leave out semantics, adhere to  the
pixel-perfect  paradigm, and will never approach anything like  SGML-based
composition  (LaTeX being an exemplary classic). I seem to be drifting off
topic, so I'll stop.

You  should  be able to use the existing hooks, but this may also  require
the  user  to  include  the necessary information  while  composing.  This
reminds me of a nice analogy from Alan Flavell. You can produce cheese and
cream  from from milk. Both are milk products. Yet, converting cheese into
cream  would  not be possible. You are better off starting from  the  fine
milk,  which  here is the analogy of semantics, provided by the user.  You
may  need  to introduce an extended SGML and I am not sure to what  extent
WordPress facilitates it.

I  would love to see a larger proportion of the Web accommodating for  and
fostering   semantics.   This   way,   one  can   gather   knowledge   and
replace/enhance  text-based  search  engines,  which  is  something  I  am
particularly interested in.

Best wishes,

Roy

But hows does that differ from the documented way? i.e. how does that 
not make an item in the submenu row called "podPress"?

Hi everyone, just thought I would send round an email saying Hi and a little bit about myself, another new guy to join the ranks. 

Well am Joe, also known as diesel online. Currently a software tester for Northbrook Technology of Northern Ireland while doing some home development with php/mysql is which am still learning. Most of my development is done with C#.NET/ASP.NET but am moving to open source development more and more. Anyone want to know anything else just hit me up. 

Thanks 
Joe

But hows does that differ from the documented way? i.e. how does that 
not make an item in the submenu row called "podPress"?

On the forums list we are working toward a Free Installation service.
We have hit a stumbling block though and we need some code.

The last part of the process for a person using this (which is a 
standard blog) will be a form.
The contact form plugin will do the job but we need 3 additions:
1 - that WP generates a number, shows the number to the person and then 
when the form is submitted that number comes through to us. This will be 
the PIN for authentication.
2 - a check box that indicates they have read everything, agree with it 
all etc.
3 - And the appropriate error messages should anything be missing.

I'm aware that the collective minds here may think another method is 
better - and that may be the case - but right now the above would be 
great. We tend to not be that good with code on the forums list though 
so any help offered would be really great.
You could email me or post to the wp-forums list.

I've done this without removing it later.   You just have to create the 
submenu item first, and then add the top level menu right after it using 
the same filename and function combination.  This will even keep the 
first submenu highlighted when you click on the top level menu.

add_submenu_page("myfile.php",'First Submenu','First 
Submenu',"do_stuff", "myfile.php", 'first_sub_page' );   

add_menu_page('Menu Tests', 'Menu Tests',"do_stuff","myfile.php", 
'first_sub_page');

add_submenu_page("myfile.php",'Second Submenu','Second 
Submenu',"do_stuff",'new_page_name', 'second_sub_page');

My example assumes you're using functions in 1 file for each page, of 
course.  There is some quirky reason why this works and I remember 
really investigating the code for the reason, but I can't remember it at 
this moment.  This was a few months ago...

Hope that helps.  :-)

Subject: [wp-hackers] do pages and posts make sense?
Message-ID: <446C7B30.1070902@gmx.de>

According to discussions in several threads many people would like to
use categories for Pages. I think that such a feature would allow more
freedom in the structure of a website. AFAIK it would be easy to
implement it but could result into problems with category specific
templates. Is this true and are there other implications? Why can't
pages belong to categories? Are there any patches or plugins to address
this issue?

Isn't page and post very similar to each other? Probably a blog is just
a specific category. Why not use only one terminology (e.g. "post") and
drop the other (e.g. "page") but add a new category "blog"? Users would
be free in the choice what they want to do with there posts. Several
blogs can easily created just by listing the posts belonging to the
specific blog-category. Additionally this concept would be more easy to
understand and to manage in the user interface than the current one.
What do you think about these issue?

Somebody slap Markus for saying the word "easy" without posting some code. ;-)

Markus, bear in mind the primary reason for pages: people need a unit
of content that lives outside of the chronological structure of the
weblog. Now imagine the category view with some pages mixed in. Where
in the reverse chronological order would you put a page? It doesn't
fit.

It's possible to write a query to get a set of pages and then display
them in some sort of order. The prime example is Manage Pages in the
admin. You get the page titles listed in a hierarchical format. It's
even possible to assign categories to pages in the database.

What remains to be decided:
* Whether it's even a worthwhile feature for WordPress
* How to display a category view of pages
* Whether and how to merge pages and posts in a category view

My answer to 1 is "no" so I haven't spent any time on 2 or 3.

Andy: worthwhile it might not be but that shouldn't dispense with the  
fact that it is an oft-requested feature on the forums. And wouldn't  
not including categorised pages in category post lists just be  
another parameter to the tag..?

There is no doubt that these suggestions can be implemented. The
reason I say it's not worthwhile is that it's a half-baked idea.
Somebody says "Let's categorize pages" and that's great, that's a seed
of a new feature set, but it's missing all of the important details:

What problem are we trying to solve? Or is this just a solution
waiting for a problem? How should it change the user interfaces, both
admin and public? What else will be affected? And many more. So this
is the point where one or two of the following will happen:

* Nobody has any idea about the details.
* This thread grows with ideas and arguments until it composes enough
rope to hang everyone involved but nothing actually gets done.
* Somebody has a bright idea and codes it.

My only reason for responding, despite remaining in camp #1, is that I
hope somebody will turn this half-baked idea into something
worthwhile. That remains to be seen.

This seems fairly obvious to me, but perhaps otehr people have different 
schemes. For example,

http://www.elharo.com/blog/privacy/2006/05/17/virtual-account-numbers/

is a post in the privacy category.

http://www.elharo.com/blog/privacy/virtual-account-numbers/

would be a page in the privacy category.

Links to /blog/privacy/virtual-account-numbers/ could appear on other 
pages in the privacy category, but not other pages in other categories 
such as tech or birds or travel.

This would probably need to be themeable so different schemes could be 
implemented.

I'm not sure how easy that is to implement, but it doesn't seem hard to 
envision.

You broach a whole new issue by bringing up permalinks. I was talking
about blog views where more than one page matches the query. To follow
your permalink structure, the question is: what should be displayed
for http://www.elharo.com/blog/privacy/ ?

Essentially the same thing that's displayed now. Pages wouldn't be part 
of the loop. However, the pages link on the right hand side would only 
include pages that were listed in the privacy or No categories. They 
would not show pages for other categories like tech or birds.

In essence, there'd need to be a function to grab all posts from this 
category, and all posts from this category+no category.

I've read through the other comments to this. I agree adding Page
categories would not seem logical.

One rider on this I would like to add however is some ability to make
Page draft. Of the 23 WordPress installations I support for clients the
biggest request seems to be 'Why can't a make the Page draft like I
can Posts?'

Seems there are many content authors who want to create the page an
save the Page for future edits but not actually publish it.

I do realize the problem however. In the wp_posts table the post_status
column values are 'static' for Pages, publish, draft or private for  
Posts. I'm
sure there are other values like attachment. So would the simple  
solution
be coming up with a new token? Then all of the logic changes to the core
code to support displaying or not displaying this Page.

This has already changed, although I can't remember quite when it was. 
Posts now have a post_status (which can be publish/draft/private/etc) 
and a post_type (which can be post/page/attachment etc).

For those that are interested:
Matt's feedback is that the space before the close image tag /> will
fix the issue.  While not having the space is also legal XHTML, it
does break some older browsers like ie 5.5 and
older.  So, having the space there is preferred and Flock is working
to implement this.

I've tested 2.1 Alpha  whatever, and  Pages will have  draft  status .

Here's a buddy of mine's experiences using one user database for two 
blogs.

http://www.moonbatty.com/blog/2006/05/16/one-user-database-2-blogs/

She said she couldn't find any documentation on the Right Way of using 
CUSTOM_USER_TABLE and CUSTOM_USER_META_TABLE. Setting these two constants 
didn't complete the task.

BUT this was post-install-time for both blogs. I suspected maybe if they 
were set at install time, it would have worked automagically... or has 
something broken in a recent release?

Pardon my naivete... but how does the study of 'being' intersect with

That's not what the custom table settings do. Some usermeta is global
(user bio, ICQ number etc.), but roles and caps are kept
per-$table_prefix so users can have different access levels on
different blogs -- Bob can write posts on his blog but only comment at
Alice's, etc.

Your friend wouldn't have much more luck starting from scratch,
either, except that the admin user would automatically be shared. (And
IIRC that only if she was running SVN trunk.) Setting
CUSTOM_USER_TABLE and CUSTOM_USER_META_TABLE would only replace her
step #3.

Solution 1: Pages are also created on a specific date; why not use this
date when they should be listed in a chronological order?

Solution 2: It's up to the administrator if pages and posts are mixed in
the same category. I could imagine a category "tech blog" for my blog
but also a category "tech tips" for instance. Other blogs as "journey
blog" or "work blog" could also be created easily by assigning
posts/pages to the specific category. When the user selects "tech tips"
she should see all the pages/posts each containing a specific tech tip.
If you still feel unhappy with mixing posts and pages, categories could
be of a type "post" resp. "page" and does allow pages resp. post only.

I hope to make it clear that in my idea every (!) blog has to have a
category to define which posts/pages to display. (of course a super
category "all" should also be possible)

I hope to got your point but please correct me if I missed it.

I would like to use categories for pages to have some categories in the
main navigation menu. The user should be able to continue to a specific
page by selecting in a sub-menu after she selected one category.

depends on the argument provided to the function:
- chronological order (default). This is nothing else than a blog
- alphabetically
- others, e.g. relevance, manual defined order

see above.

With respect to your opinion I think it would be an advantage for the
users to be free in choice. As I already wrote it would also make the
concept of WP more understandable. I guess many first-time-users are
thinking "what is the difference between Post and Page?"

Because that is the primary difference between pages and posts.   
Posts have a chronological flow.  Pages are chronologically agnostic.

I've not seen this confusion.  When people hear "post" they think  
"blog post," i.e. chronological entries.  When they hear "page" they  
think "contact page" or "about page" i.e. non-chronological entries.

Freedom of choice, for anything that is less than moderately popular,  
is accommodated though the plugin system.  WordPress 2.1 is gaining  
the ability to have arbitrary post types... so "categorized_page"  
could be created, and it could behave as you like.

One way to do this would be via parent page containers.  If I were  
going to do it with categories, I'd probably make my own page2cat  
table to manage the associations without interfering with post2cat.

Bottom line is that this isn't something that the average user is  
going to want, and it'd just add coding, debugging, maintenance,  
documentation, and usage headaches if it were included in core.  I'd  
write it as a plugin for the WordPress 2.1 branch.  That way, you and  
the people who want this functionality can have it, but ordinary  
users (and developers) aren't burdened by a minority-use feature.

What do you mean by "'semantic' web"? I've had trouble finding a
canonical definition. I understand the term to mean "self-describing
content".

The web as we know it was invented by nuclear physicists (and it shows).
Perhaps the semantic web will be invented by psychologists. A semantic
web could "know" itself and adapt to new content, which is a form of
"being". I'd study that for a dollar. I'll help build it for fun. If
only there were a spec...

Bridge the gap between verbal description and more formal languages for
expression. This can be done without detracting from human-readable text.

I feel much better knowing we're at least on the same wavelength. :)

Thanks for the links. I knew of microformats. One of my experimental
semantic-web plugins (I call it "Outreach Mission") was inspired by what
I read there.

Generating a unique number, displaying it, putting that value in a hidden field that is part of a submit along with a verification check box, and checking all of that when the submit is done, is probably a 5 minute task for most of us.  

You're probably not getting any responses, because we're a little unsure that that's all you'll be wanting. To me, it sounds like you're asking how to do a fairly basic task that will be used with something that already required a much higher skill level to create.  Maybe I'm missing something.

Do you just want one of us to toss up a basic example php file that does what I've described in the first sentence? And if so, would you want the options to be shown in the URL (such that the user could type them all in), or do you want the submitted values to be hidden (probably better)?  Also, do you care how long the number is?  And will it become the user's ID (so that each user MUST get a unique one) or is it just going to be used to verify the person came from the registration page?   If that's not what you want, could you give me/us more information?

Thanks for replying :)
It's not complex:
http://www.tamba2.org.uk/install/
Follow that through.

What we need is for the person submitting their data to be sure when 
they are contacted that the person who contacts them is the real deal.
They have to see the number.
Ideally that number is cc'd to them.
They get an email from us with that number.

Trust issues are another matter - we are just after the authentication.

It's part of something that will live at wordpress.net and operated by 
established WP users. The above is just getting it looking and working well.

Yes, as described in the wiki. But I'm talking about if this makes sense.

These terminology could remain by providing two categories "posts"
"pages" by default.

Does any such plugin exist? This would be very helpful for me.

Sort of - but the other way round.

The end result is that the user authenticates us because they will be 
giving us all their webhost details.

Process:
User completes form and is shown a unique code '56789'
They get a confirmation email that also has that code.
We get the completed form and that unique code as well.
The installer then emails saying "Here is the code 56789, you can trust me."
-so we are proving who we are.

How that code is passed from the form to us (email / database) is up for 
discussion - I only thought email because it's simple and straightforward.
But generating, displaying and then distributing the code to the two 
parties is beyond what we have been doing. If we can get this going and 
tested then we can launch the project - it's the final piece of the jigsaw.

This is the exact behaviour the Gallery project uses. A user files a ticket
with details (gallery version and so on). A unique code is generated and
displayed to the user (as well as emailed to him). When someone from the
support team contacts the user, we copy the details the user submitted in
the email including the unique identifier.

We have a very basic admin interface where all tickets are listed, and we
can change the status of the tickets like open/pending/in
progress/abandoned/invalid/completed. When someone changes a status for a
ticket from open to pending it gets assigned that user and removed from the
open list.

I've modified a version of the Contact form to do this too.  I might get time to test it some this afternoon.  It sounds like this Gallery project is already up, tested and working.  But if that doesn't work out for you, I can send you a link for the altered version of the Ryan's ContactForm plugin. (BTW it will work side by side with contact form).

We, as in Gallery, has this running as a custom Drupal module so it's not
directly portable. I just wanted to help out Podz illustrating what he
needs. :)

There are plenty of discussions about what semantic web is or is not.  Those
are fun to read, and I'm not going to try to make it more confused. But, I
do want to say how I approach it.  I believe the web can become even more
effective for data sharing and consumption if the data are also published in
a more structured way that computer can easily understand and thus process.
An example is blog feed using RSS1.0, which is in RDF format. Semantic web
is evolving rapidly.  It will make sense to most people when it hits one
killer application that has broad impact to the world.

>From where I stand, I focus on solving specific problems using semantic web
approach in combination with any other technologies that are required.  The
problem I'm trying to solve is that researchers don't have an easy-to-use
publishing tool to publish their studies in a RDF or ontology they choose.
Since wordpress was initially built with the semantic publishing concept in
mind, I would think it should be an ideal platform to implement more

So, is there a way I can grab r3637 via svn since the tagging appears
not to have happened and grabbing the trunk gives me 2.1a1 and has
some issues...

I only have time for so much fun, more's the pity. I'm aware of the
quantity of information out there about the "semantic web". I've read a
fair amount and I think we're all pretty much after the same thing.

Yes, that's what I'm after, at the human->computer interface. The
semantics are in the wetware, which is notoriously lazy, so I'm
experimenting with ways to coax it out gently.

I believe the blog /is/ the killer application of the web. An universal
easy-to-use multimedia personal programmable publishing machine, of
which RSS is just one content type of many it can produce on demand.
What more can you have? Your mind available for direct download? ;)

The learning curve is steep but the view from the top is goddamn
beautiful. If you would like to examine any of my plugins for ideas (or
laughs) please ask.  My major unfinished works can be found at
http://www.libertini.net/libertus/wordpress-plugins/

If you have questions about the voodoo of the internal mechanics of
WordPress, this is the list to ask.

IMHO, it should *still* be tagged whenever someone can squeeze in time to do so.

Howdy Happy Hackers,

I've now become one of the WordPress faithful, and have been enjoying the
experience so far. Just found a killer edit-in-place plugin at
http://www.headzoo.com/downloads - with a little style tweaking, you'll be
flying.

I come to you this evening with a hacking help request. In my travels, I've
discovered this bit of code for the 404.php. The problem is: BlogWare URLs
do not contain keywords. :P BlogWare URLs do, however, contain date strings
similar to those found in WP URLs. So...

 http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2006/2/23/1780165.html

is now at:

 http://chris.pirillo.com/2006/02/23/googlefasting-day-1/

Could this be rewritten (and shared, for other frustrated ex-BlogWarers) to
identify the date range from the old BlogWare URLs, then pop the visitor to
the date archive page for that day? Sure would save me a bit of transition
frustration.

<?
$search_term = substr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'],1);
$search_term = urldecode(stripslashes($search_term));
$search_url = 'http://chris.pirillo.com/index.php?s=';
$full_search_url = $search_url . $search_term;
$full_search_url = preg_replace('/ /', '%20', $full_search_url);
$full_page = implode("", file($full_search_url));
print_r($full_page); die();
?>

Any help is appreciated,

Chris

This comes to show that WordPress is more SEO-friendly and URL's make
arrival at pages more rhetorical.

I notice that both are broken at the moment.

Have  you  consider  taking  a different approach  altogether?  Trying  to
re-write  URL's  for totally separable CMS's is hard. You might be  better
off  producing  XML sitemaps using one of the free tools from  SourceForge
(for  ststic  pages). There is a plug-in for WordPress which does this  as
well.  Then, redirect (at server-level) with error status 301 from the old
URL's  to the new ones. You still need to manage one-to-one page mappings,
but  worry  not...  you will not lose Googlejuice... nor will you  have  a
reason to fast. *smile*


Hope it helps,

Roy

I'm relatively new on this list too, but I seem to be the one that is awake at the moment.  So I figured I'd welcome you.

Thats intriguing! I'll check it out.

Could I suggest another alternative to fixing your 404 page?

You may or may not know that the permalink style is highly customizable.  In addition to the standard date naming and id naming conventions, you can create your own.  So, if you'd prefer using something closer to BlogWare's style, you could go to your options page and into the Permalinks tab and choose the custom option to add your own style.

For instance something like this:
/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%post_id%/

or maybe even this:
/blog/_archives/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%post_id%.htm

Might actually produces some good results for you...  Especially if you are intertested in doing some creative importing of your old posts (or some direct DB manipulation to get the post IDs to match.

I'll probably look at your code later when I'm not falling asleep on the keyboard...

I hate BlogWare and it's un-SEO'ed URLs. ;) In reflecting on all the
options, I'm thinking the date / date redirect is going to be the easiest
for most visitors until Google catches up. I've already uploaded a new
sitemap (yeah, I caught that plugin, Roy). It's just figuring out the right
sequence / regular expression to use.

Looks as though I removed a plugin without also removing the code (been
trying to port UltimateTagWarrior to insert META keywords in the header to
no avail). If you wanna see what I've slapped together:

Put this in your site root's .htaccess

Note: make sure it is ABOVE the WordPress block or it won't work.

That'll at least get them to the day's archive.  Even better would be  
to redirect to a PHP script that'd either look in BlogWare's  
database, or consult a giant PHP array, and figure out EXACTLY what  
post is trying to be viewed, and redirect to that, but that's  
considerably more work than just pasting that one line into  
your .htaccess

DISABLE THAT PLUGIN!

It bypasses many vital WordPress security checks, so makes your blog
vulnerable to types of vandalism from which the WordPress developers
have spent MONTHS of effort protecting you.

I sent the URL for your comment to Sean (the plugin's creator). Not to start
a war, but... here's what he says:

"Anything is possible, although that isn't much to go on.  It would be more
helpful if the person saying to disable the plugin explained why it's a
security risk.  On the backend of the plugin, the /wp-config, and the
/wp-admin/admin.php scripts are included in the main script. If the person
trying to edit a post isn't an admin, and isn't logged in, then the backend
scripts will not work.  There is no way around it."

Would rather not outline exactly how to get around it on a public  
forum... but the way I read the code, there is more than one way  
around it, and the damage might not be limited to vandalism on a post- 
by-post basis... I see a possible SQL injection point.

I'll contact Sean directly, but I'd advise disabling the plugin in  
the meantime.

That's alright, I'm here. :)  I need to pay more attention to the
hacker's list, it's starting to collect dust in my Google inbox.

Okay, so at the top of the plugin's backend script, the admin.php
script is included.  This is the same as nearly every other script in
the admin directory.  So unless I'm missing something, any security
holes in the plugin also exists in the core of WP, which kind of makes
a security hole in the plugin a mute point.

- Sean
P.S. That's the only reason I include the admin.php, since the backend
script doesn't need it.

There is no referer check that I can see. Your plugin directly UPDATEs
the database instead of calling wp_update_post().

Hey Sean. ;-)

Here's my security audit:

(1) Backend is locked down to registered users (via admin.php), but  
editing of posts via backend.php does not utilize the  
"current_user_can()" functions to make sure that a low level  
"subscriber" user cannot edit posts when he doesn't have that  
capability. ("Man on the inside" attack)  You're using the functions  
on the frontend, which is good, but the user could still create the  
request manually and edit things they're not supposed to be editing.

(2) Backend appears to be vulnerable to CSF (Cross-site forgery)  
attack.  Someone creates an HTML form with a POST method, and fills  
it with data to simulate an AJAX request.  A legit WP user is tricked  
into visiting this site, which submits the form, and causes  
backend.php to perform some type of vandalism.

Referrer check is, sadly, unreliable here, because of an IE bug that  
allows for referrer spoofing for AJAX requests.  I suggest you look  
at how WP handles AJAX security in the admin (sends the login cookie  
along with the AJAX request and verifies it on the backend).

(3) Line 29 of backend.php has this SQL snippet: WHERE ID = $id
	$id comes from the raw POST data.  You are leaving it unquoted in  
the SQL, and thus assuming that it is going to be an integer.  But  
without  casting it to an integer, an attacker could use it to insert  
malicious SQL.  Note that this would require getting past admin.php,  
so it would require using #1 or #2 to do that.

	For example, raw POST data like: action=edit&id=5;DROP DATABASE  
databasename;

	I'd recommend casting to int and quoting the $id.

		$id = (int) $id;
		WHERE ID = '$id'

Paul,
  I stopped doing referer checks a long time ago because they are
pretty much pointless. :) The refering URL is so easily faked that
it's not even worth checking.  Especially with Firefox extentions like
RefControl.

  Not using wp_update_post() doesn't seem like a *security* risk to
me, it's just avoiding some code the makes sure the post is well
formatted.  I chose not to use it because it seems a bit like using a
sledge hammer to kill a fly.  I want to keep the plugin as "peppy" has
possible, which means as little code as possible.

  Anyway, I'm always open to suggestions.  Security is certainly
something I've given thought to with this plugin, since it has the
potential to expose the internals of a person's blog right there on
the front page.

BTW: Does WP even check for referers in it's own code?  I've submitted
comments to people's blogs using telnet from my home computer.

Doesn't check refs for comment submission, but for database-changing  
stuff in the admin, yeah.  Up until version 2.0.2, that is.  The  
upcoming 2.0.3 maintenance release (and the upcoming 2.1 release) use  
a "secret hash with expiration" (nonce [1]) method that works more  
securely and more reliably than ref checks.

I recall making a conscience decision to not use that function, but I
can't remember why. Either way, good point.  I've never run a blog
that has users other than myself, so it's not something I've given
enough thought to.

Like I was saying to Paul, that check seems very pointless to me.
Also like I was saying to Paul, I've submitted comments to WP blogs
using telnet and sending raw HTTP data, no form needed.  This seems to
be a security hole that is unavoidable.

Wouldn't that be pointless with admin.php included, since those
scripts check the cookie?

Right.  My thinking is by the time the script gets that far, the user
has already been verified, which is a bit sloppy on my part.

Isn't wpdb::escape() supposed to handle issues like that? :)

Good points Mark.  My "flagship" plugin is being beta tested now, and
released on Monday.  After that I'll run the Edit N Place plugin
through the mill and lock it down more.  That being said, I still
think the plugin is pretty safe for now.  A lot has to go wrong before
someone can gain entry, and the plugin is only susceptible to some of
the holes that WP in general is vulnerable to.

Absolutely. The referer is just one of many pieces of evidence a website
has to authorise a request, but it is a major one. It is a check I might
relax upon demand ("behind a proxy? no worries! here's another way.")
and certainly not one I would give up by default. I like to have a front
door even though I know locks can be picked.

Mark has answered your other questions. The wp_update_post() thing is
just best practice. If the function already exists, use it. If the
function doesn't already exist, find it. :)

All the best,
Paul

Good points Paul.  My main reason for giving up referring checks is
because they backfire.  I've used them on client websites before, and
when customers started complaining that they couldn't submit forms, I
stopped using them.

Oh, grep has become my best friend when it comes to WordPress. :)  In
the future I would certainly appreciate it if someone would drop me a
line when they have issues like this with one of my plugins.  It's
kinda lousy to find out through a person, through another person,
through yet another person, that someone is saying don't use the
plugin.  That just means  a legitimate security hole in the plugin
goes unnoticed by me for that much longer.  I usually make an attempt
to notify the developer if I find a security hole in the software, and
I've sent emails to the WP devs before because of security holes.

If a user is tricked into submitting a malicious request to his own  
blog, the cookie is used to verify him, so admin.php is taken care  
of.  Putting the cookie into the actual POST is something the hacker  
can't do, because the hacker can't get the cookie.  So, the cookie  
works as authentication for admin.php, and the cookie included in the  
POST works as verification that the request was intentional, which is  
what WP checks on AJAX requests.

escape() will slash your single quotes, and can prevent injection, as  
long as you're using quotes, and as long as you actually run your PHP  
vars through it!

The CSF vector requires a bit of social engineering, yes, but Chris  
has comment registration turned on, so anyone could register and edit

I did some experimenting with a textpattern style of "xml template" but 
concluded that it was not worth the time to rewrite template functions to 
support it.

Template tags are just like <wp:the_title /> and you can pass some attributes 
to them as well. the loop is nice cause it's just <wp:posts> ... </wp:posts>. 
Really, the tags are just "wrappers" for the PHP function calls, but more ... 
limited.

Anyway you can see it here 
(http://mattread.com/projects/wp-themes/wordpattern-templates/) and a working 
example here (http://mattread.com/test/)

Dearest Hackers,

I need this, and will pay someone $50 to make it to work with WP 2.0:

 http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/04/twilight-autosave/

Seems as though the cookie works (it stores the information), but after the
first time you delete the cookie'd text, you start getting PHP errors and a
non-functioning plugin.

Another $50 for a truly WP 2.0 version of this one:

Love,

Chris

Works fine for me. :( What errors, specifically?

What is a "truly WP 2.0 version"? If you just mean "actually works in
WP 2.0", that's easy enough. Here's a quick go at it in case no-one's
sent you anything off-list.

Well, here is the next version that I'll probably release on Monday.
It addresses some of the issues mentioned here.  The backend now:

1. Checks the that user can edit the post via the user_can_edit_post() function
2. Type cast the $id variable and escapes it
3. Uses session variables and a token system to ensure the incoming
new post data is in fact coming from the edit form.

I'll probably put it out on Monday, but you're free to tear it apart. :)

Weird. Didn't show up on my test server. Might be a Windows thing. New
version doesn't do it on plugin activation, at least, but haven't

It looks like this is actually a different template language, rather 
than just aliases and filters for web form editing of the PHP files.

Jumping in late here:

This just seems like a bad idea to me.  First of all, I don't know
anyone who actually uses the editor, although like Matt said, a lot of
people do.  But a lot still isn't much.  It seems like a lot of work
for something only a small group of people would actually use.

I can imagine the confusion this kind of system would cause. "Hey, I
just FTPd my theme edits, and now WordPress doesn't work!  What do you
mean the template system only works in the admin editor?"

Some kind of semi-theme engine seems like it would cause more
confusion than it would solve.  Either have a full blown theme system,
or don't.

WordPress could take the Drupal route, and allow people to install
theme engines, and have themes specific to an engine, but that will
also be confusing for some people.

P.S. I don't understand the logic behind pointing someone to the codex
and saying, "Have at it", when they complain about the documentation.
Why would someone who *didn't* write the software be expected to write
the documentation for it?  Who understands the software better, and is
in a better position to write the docs?  The developers, or someone
who tinkers with WordPress?  How am I supposed to write the
documentation for some_function() when I didn't create the function?

I can't enter the trac system. It keeps asking for my login.  I can enter 
the web interface of this list with no problem and have e-mailed myself the 
password (again) to confirm it.  What I am in doubt is, what goes into the 
username field of the login pop-up, is it

satyam at satyam.com.ar
satyam%40satyam.com.ar
satyam
satyam--at--satyam.com.ar (my cookie has this one)

or what.Case sensitive?  The web interface uses all those to refer to me. 
Which is the one trac would use?  Using IE6

Hackers,

I just got OpenSearch configured. Kinda. It's not really working the way it
should yet.

This works:
 http://chris.pirillo.com/wp-content/plugins/opensearch/description.php

This works:
 http://chris.pirillo.com/wp-content/plugins/opensearch/opensearch.php?s=boo

This doesn't, and it should (according to .htaccess, TMK):
 http://chris.pirillo.com/os-query?s=book

One new line in the .htaccess (single line):
RewriteRule ^os-query?(.*)$
/opt/sp/pirillo.com/chris.pirillo.com/wp-content/plugins/opensearch/opensear
ch.php?$1 [QSA,L]

I'm not sure what I messed up, as the file is definitely in that location on
my server (per the working hyperlink above). The shorter URL should work,
and when combined with a real search, you'll see AutoDiscovery enabled:
 http://chris.pirillo.com/index.php?s=bingo

And for that, you'll need this code in your header.php template:

<?php if (is_search()) { ?>
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="<?php
bloginfo('name'); ?>: <?php echo wp_specialchars($s); ?>"
href="http://chris.pirillo.com/os-query?s=<?php echo wp_specialchars($s);
?>" />
<?php } ?>

Thanks to these two folks for getting the ball rolling:

Looks like your server is running Apache 2.x.x, there could be some issues
there. Does the server have mod_frontpage or the frontpage extensions
installed. If it does, that's your problem. Any changes you make to
.htaccess if FP is there will wreak havoc. There's a pretty easy fix if
that's it though.

The genius (Shayne Sweeney) figured it out - the paths were relative to
chris.pirillo.com, not the entire server. I should've thought of that. :P

This will need to exist ABOVE the WordPress rewrite block.  In fact,  
you might want to put a comment below the WP rewrite block:

> # DON'T PUT ANYTHING DOWN HERE!

The reason for this is that WP's rewrite rules act as a sort of  
"catchall."  Anything that hasn't matched a rewrite rule yet and  
points to a file that doesn't exist, gets sucked up by WordPress'  
rewrite rules.  So your rule wouldn't ever get matched down below it.

That just means that output is being sent to the browser  
prematurely... on line 255 of batch-categories.php, which is very  
likely the last line, which means that you probably have a blank  
space after the ending ?> in the file.

The file should start with <?php and end with ?>

Hello everybody,

I've been having a rather big problem with akismet since for the past
3 days I've found more than 50 comments (every day) in my moderation
queue.

Does anyone knows why is this happening?

The official Akismet plugin for WordPress doesn't use the moderation  
queue... something else must be doing it.  And this isn't a support  
list.

I know that. And I know that this is not a support list. The question
was not if akismet is using a moteration queue but why doen't akismet
catches this comments as spam when they clearly are.

Did it occur to you that you might be in the vanguard for a certain type
of spam?  Akismet uses metrics collected from every blog it monitors in
order to try to keep ahead of the spammers' curve - if a particularly
novel brand of spammer has taken to hitting your blog, then the best
thing you can do is flag all comments that end up in your moderation
queue as "spam" and help teach Akismet that there's a new variant on
comment spam out there.

That's what I've been doing, currently there are around 200 comments
of the same type all marked as spam to teach akismet and they still go
into the moderation queue.

I have a different kind of Akismet problem. Sometimes in the last week I got over 1000 comments in Akismet queue. As Akismet sometimes mis-classifies normal email as spam, I always glance the Akismet queue. But with 1000+ comments! Also it doesn't display more than 150 at a time.

Podz,
I updated the plugin I put together for you. If you tried it over the weekend, it might not have worked as designed.  Here's the link to the updated version:

http://www.thecodecave.com/downloads/plugins/wp-contract-form.zip

http://www.thecodecave.com/?p=133

0.2 REQUIRED RELEASE
Fixed the MD5.  It now uses website instead of email too.  Then the same email contact can be used for multiple websites.
    Removed the CSS styles that were incompatible with my theme (and probably others). They are renamed and can be put back in easily.
    Added carraige returns to the email where needed.
    Made the whole thing WC3 <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecodecave.com%2F%3Fp%3D133&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline">compliant</a>
    
0.1 Initial version
    Automatically sends the email to the destination AND the user, reversing the From and To.
    Required the website to be filled in.
    Added a terms field that is customizable.
    Added a customizable ?I agree? line
    Added a checkbox and verified it is filled out in the end.
    I did not bother creating a legit POT file for language localization
    Generated a unique ID for the contract.

Including .htaccess is a bad idea. Most/Many hosting (UNIX) providers have
the MS Frontpage extensions installed on the machines, FP claims the
.htaccess file as it's own, causing many folks all kinds of problems with
wordpress, even if they're not using the FP extensions. I've posted a
detailed explaination of the problem and the only known fix in the codex
here -

 It seems like .htaccess looks the same all the time in WordPress 2.x. But
it still attempts to update it when the premalink structure is changed.

 It would be easier if .htaccess simply was included in the distribution
and WordPress doesn't try to write to it.

I like the idea that .htaccess is not touched once a site is up and
running.

I think the installation procedure could create .htaccess or modify an
existing one, if necessary (and it probably is).  This feels safer than
having the installation overwrite and existing .htaccess (think about
upgrades).

I agree that .htaccess shouldn't be included in the distribution, so
that unpacking a new version on top of an old installation wouldn't
overwrite any custom .htaccess rules.

Plugins require access to .htaccss that is currently provided via hook. 
  If you install .htaccess at the onset and disallow WordPress from 
altering it, all of those plugins become broken.

I'm curious why disabling write access to .htaccess after its initial 
setting by WP is not enough for folks who need that level of control.

Go to Google. Type in "wordpress plugin mt underscore", and click "I 
feel lucky". You should get this link:

  http://orderedlist.com/articles/wordpress-underscore-plugin/

Alternately, goto the WordPress Codex. Search for "underscore plugin". 
You should get this one:

I don't think we (b5media) are the largest on Matt's list, but we do about
25M pages/month (not counting feed impressions) running WP. No issues at
all, except the DB load that comment spam across 150 sites causes, but
beyond that it's nice and stable.

May I ask why there were aspersions cast up WP's ability to handle load? I
recall this being a common "fear" among the corporate types. Is there a

Just to make it clear, my main point was that I think including
.htaccess in the distribution is a dangerous idea, as it can easily
lead to users unintentionally overwriting their .htaccess files.

When WP modifies .htaccess it is careful about keeping old rules (or
at least it used to be).

> Plugins require access to .htaccss that is currently provided via hook.

I'm curious what these plugins do that WP's rewrite processing cannot
do for them.

> I'm curious why disabling write access to .htaccess after its initial 
> setting by WP is not enough for folks who need that level of control.

I can't answer that one, as that's asking about something I didn't
write.

But I still like the idea of .htaccess not being modified.  I think
it would be better if WP's own rewrite processing could work for all
plugins.

Personally I'd even be happy to just add the few simple rules needed
by WP into .htaccess myself, but I think it is nice that WP does it
for me.

However, the rules can get hairy when more than one package is using
virtual URL's (i.e. ones that don't map directly to files).  I only
have one such package installed currently, but it took me a while to
figure out how to make it run nicely in a subdirectory with WP in
the top level directory:

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/(photos)/
    RewriteRule ^(.+)$ /index.php/$1 [L,QSA]

I wouldn't expect WP to be able to preserve the extra rule in there.
Nothing is impossible but I think it would be a slippery road to try
and catch all the variations people might use.

An "obvious" solution would be to run WP in a subdirectory as well,
and I'll probably migrate to that at some point.

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

Default WordPress 2.02 clocks at about 1.2 requests per second on a 1.8 Ghz Pentium 4 machine (Windows 2000, Apache Server 2.x, PHP 5.x) with 128MB RAM. The requests were made from a different machine with same configuration.

With wp-cache 2 performance improves significantly.

As Jeremy points out the major load on server these days is due to comment spammers.

Well here is the deal. I work for a company that builds websites
for mostly non-profits. These site range in size from 3-5 pages upward
or 100 pages. Most of the larger sites contain blog and news feeds and
2-12 feed categories.

Until last summer we provided CMS abilities by installing and templating
Movable Type. Note for the purpose of this email I'm using CMS to mean
something where the client can maintain thier own content.

Last summer we started a CMS package due diligence. I chose WP as a
possible light-weight alternative to MT and other options like  
Accrisoft.

In the minds of many on my tech team members and upper management,
they question if a CMS that generates dynamic pages can handle any
serious load. They actually like the concept in MT where every time
content is added you need to rebuild your pages. I've pointed out that
in recent versions of MT mow implement dynamic page generation.

So this was my reason for asking. Since Thanksgiving 2005 I'm crunched
through a dozen client site using WP. And have become the WP answer man
(I like this title) for project implementations using or considering  
WP. I've very
confident in the ability of WP and use of a caching plugin to handle  
a moderate

There is a big project under proposal. I'm pushing for WP. Others are

for MT or other packages.

The key point here is that over the Christmas holiday I converted our

The short answer is that, yes, dynamic page creation isn't that much of a
load. Obviously this load can be reduced via caching, an app server layer
(if you really need to go there ... I'm not convinced you do if you're
rolling it out to client sites, but it's always an option), DB and webserver
tuning, etc.

End of the day, if the sites are doing less than 100M pages/month in traffic
(and peaking at less than 10M/day), WP out of the box on 1-2 servers should
work fairly well. Obviously I'd recommend matching your hardware to your
uptime requirements, and budgeting for growth, but it's a nice, lean system
that, when properly tuned, can easily handle a crapload of traffic.

As I said earlier, we run WP with 25M pages. We have 3 servers in a cluster
(largely for uptime reasons more than anything). The cluster could easily do
40M pages with no tuning whatsoever, and probably 60-80M with some more
tuning, and the sky's the limit with better caching.

Properly managed, 2-5 servers can take you to the moon and back from a load
perspective with WP.

Subject: Re: [wp-hackers] Sites running WP

Well here is the deal. I work for a company that builds websites
for mostly non-profits. These site range in size from 3-5 pages upward
or 100 pages. Most of the larger sites contain blog and news feeds and
2-12 feed categories.

Until last summer we provided CMS abilities by installing and templating
Movable Type. Note for the purpose of this email I'm using CMS to mean
something where the client can maintain thier own content.

Last summer we started a CMS package due diligence. I chose WP as a
possible light-weight alternative to MT and other options like  
Accrisoft.

In the minds of many on my tech team members and upper management,
they question if a CMS that generates dynamic pages can handle any
serious load. They actually like the concept in MT where every time
content is added you need to rebuild your pages. I've pointed out that
in recent versions of MT mow implement dynamic page generation.

So this was my reason for asking. Since Thanksgiving 2005 I'm crunched
through a dozen client site using WP. And have become the WP answer man
(I like this title) for project implementations using or considering  
WP. I've very
confident in the ability of WP and use of a caching plugin to handle  
a moderate
load.

There is a big project under proposal. I'm pushing for WP. Others are  
pushing
for MT or other packages.

The key point here is that over the Christmas holiday I converted our  
own site to run under WP from MT.

On the sites developed for clients 90% have comment disabled. We
build the templates custom based on our proposed design. Of the dozen
sites I created for clients only 2 have comment template code available.
Of those two, one requested we remove the comment code because of  
spamming.

Our servers are VPS FreeBSD/Linux servers running Apache, MySQL 4.1.  
I have looked
at some of the WP cache plugins. All seem to have great promise. Just

Sounds like I need to setup my own benchmark system with WP and MT

if the site in discussion (current or past or future) has a static design 
(no comments, no counts, nothing php-ish only JS dynamic as needed...), it's 
not unimaginable to take the wp-cache plugin and turn it into a mt-like 
wp-2-html plugin.  you'd let the plugin create full html pages, and when 
content is changed in the admin panel hooks would trigger regeneration.

again, that's assuming you aren't using plugins that do 'dynamic stuff' via 
php, like weighted word graphs, traffic tracking, etc.  the moment you do, 
you need to stick with stuff like wp-cache which can allow you to even call 
dynamic code from within cached pages, if needed...

but, yes, with properly tuned apache/lighttpd, mysql, query cache, maybe 
memcached, an opcode cache for PHP, and wp-cache, you can push quite a lot 
of throughput.

Regarding the question you posed above about why a plugin would need to 
write to the .htaccess, a plugin could insert this rule in the proper 
place for you.

Note that it would be more efficient to use this .htaccess rule than 
loading the most minimal scripts of WordPress, interpreting the rewrite 
internally, and then attempting to load whatever the originally intended 
target might have been (in this case, it looks like a gallery?).

Using a plugin to add this rule would prevent the rule from being lost 
when you allow WordPress to save new rules.  Without the plugin, 
WordPress would obviously overwrite any manually added rules within the 
WordPress block of rules.

Thanks Matt.

The very cool thing about this was the use of the dynamic Pages  
hierarchy. When the content author (up in my DC office) wants a new  
top-level item she just adds it to the page level and 'magic' the  
node appears on the site. Unlike the old MT days when this had to be  
changed by a developer only. Not that MT couldn't handle this. It  
just was not architected that way via our templates.

There are a number of others site we have worked on using WP as the  
back-end CMS. And correct none look like a blog. Though some contain  
blog or news feeds.

Thanks.

The availability of that kind of look and feel is what made me choose
WordPress.  I didn't want a typical "blog" looking site, but I really liked
the WordPress feature set.  2 years on and knowing a bit more about site
hosting now, there's still little out there in these other projects that
would draws me to a "true" CMS tool.

I've actually got a CMS style WordPress theme that I am working on.  It
would not be appropriate for your standard blog - comments don't have a
home, but as a company/individual portfolio site, if every thing I have
envisioned works out well, it will be pretty incredible.  The Mind Share
site, with it's three columns, reminds me of what I am doing with my theme,
With pages listed on the left, and they bring up a list of subpage titles in
the middle and that brings up the actual  post in the center.  The look and
feel is totally different though.  

In any case, WordPress is a great tool for this stuff. The new page is good
idea and I look forward to seeing what all is added.

I can't tell if you do this or not, but one thing my CMS theme's option tab
does is allow you to specify an entry, to be included in the menu/list of
pages, that actually links back Categories & the time based post structure
in WordPress.  It's great for News and Press releases...

Ah! Never mind... I finally ventured into the
http://www.mindshare.net/aboutus/ section... It looks like that's exactly
what you've done.  Your probably using the, currently underutilized,
category descriptions for the headers for those pages too... 

Shoot... I should have worked faster....

I agree with Matt.  Jolly good site!

There are a lot of 'em out there, but I don't want to waste any screen real
estate on any of 'em - just like with tagging to Technorati, Gada.be, etc.
Is there a plugin that would have a comprehensive list of either social
bookmarking sites or external tag search engines?

I was hoping to find one that would, when you hovered over a designated word
(either 'Bookmark' or a tag), a small tooltip would pop up with those images
inside of it, allowing you to send it to that selected service? This way,
the page can remain uncluttered - and the user's social bookmarking / tag
site could be easily accessed. Knowwhatimean?

I've been using WP as a CMS for my clients for about a year now.  My 
clients pick it up quickly, and we hear nothing but good things about 
how easy it is to use.  I've used other CMS systems, they all do too 
much stuff and are too confusing for my clients.  WP lets us my clients 
see only what they need to, and I don't have to install all the bulk of 
a "complete CMS system".  I'll be using it for all our sites in the 
future, including a real estate and e-commerce site.  I just keep 
developing plugins for all the new features.  The anti-spam plugins are 
always a must.

Our site (http://www.concept64.com/) uses WP, and the following client 
sites do, too:  

http://www.sauconcreek.org/
http://www.bethlehemsoccerclub.org/
http://www.secretshairandnail.com/
http://www.ryanasher.com/
http://www.plasticprofiles.com/
http://www.commonwealthconsulting.com/

 From my perspective, anything is possible using WP.  It's got one of 
the greatest frameworks for developing any PHP/MySQL site.  I've seen 
the other end of the spectrum (used to work with IBM's WebSphere 
Commerce Suite) and it's a complete nightmare.  "Do one thing and do it 
well."

Ryan,

Those are very cool site. Again I think we all could contribute a  
dozen or so sites that all do not follow the standard layout of  
blogs. I too agree WP is a wonderful and very flexible product. I  
love that I don't have to deal with a template tag language. I can  
extend WP using my own functions/includes/plugins.

Chris,

Sounds like just a quick hack to sociable or something, purely on the
display side, no? I mean, it's really just a matter of snagging some tooltip
code from somewhere and wrapping that around the existing output code.

Good idea, we might just do this for b5 - for the same reasons you
mentioned. If we do, want me to send you the code?

Certainly. So long as Gada.be gets into the tag search one. :)

You can use the ubernyms plugin (wp2 compatible)
http://www.huddledmasses.org/jaykul/ubernyms-20/

You can define the text to be shown in tooltip. specify the links you
wanna shown as part of that text :)

Nah, he wants what ubernyms >uses< which is the DomTT library:
http://www.mojavelinux.com/projects/domtooltip/

You should be able to spit custom html into the tooltip, where the html is 
generated by one of the two (or three) social plugins.

Hey all,

    In order to block a flood of direct-submission comment spam-- 
stuff that was just hitting the WP post scripts directly, never 
touching a post or its comment form-- I hacked some measures into 
wp-comments-post.php.  These took the basic form of checking to see 
if the submission came from a post comment form, and if not, skipping 
over everything in wp-comments-post.php from the comment "//if the 
user is logged in" to the $location redirect.  By preserving the 
redirect, I figured I could fool any scripts that hit the scripts 
directly but also checked to see if they got the post page back as a 
result.
    I'd like to abstract this process out to a plugin, so I don't have 
to re-hack wp-comments-post.php every time I upgrade.  So what I'm 
wondering is, what hook should I hang on to start this check?  I 
thought about copying one of the hooks Akismet uses, but I didn't 
really know why it was using the ones it was using, so that seemed 
like a fragile solution at best.  I also don't really have to start 
where I did with my hack-- it just seemed like a good place.
    Also, should the plugin itself do the redirect part instead of 
trying to somehow jump to the appropriate point in 
wp-comments-post.php?  That seems simplest, but I wasn't sure if 
there was a better way.
    Thanks for any help with this.

How about the filter 'preprocess_comment', called at the start of
wp_new_comment?  That gets it right away.

Having written my own solution (CG-AntiSpam), I can give you one word of 
advice: were I a spammer, I wouldn't necessarily ever check for response 
codes, redirects, etc.  That'd just slow the system down, as I'd have to log 
the ones that didn't make it through, what code did it get, etc.  Script 
kiddies just want to spam away and forget it.

Heck, in the early days, I even did the 'tar pit' thing which waited before 
sending a response... of course, that meant I opened myself up to a DOS type 
thing by being slammed with spam and keeping all the connections open for 
extended seconds... bad. ;)

So, my current AntiSpam just detects, sends a quick response code (it's a 
modular system, so depending on which detection mechanism 'hits first', it 
sets the response code to post), and then immediately exits.

If you'd like a look at my latest code and how I approached the problem, 
drop me an email offline and I can zip it up for you.

What I've seen so far is that most spammers use a zombie network, and  
the small bits of code they run uses the internet explorer engine  
that's present on the hijacked machines.

Which means, if  you do this:

	header("Location: http://some-really-large-download.iso");

in your anti-spam plugin, you'll notice that most spammers see a  
significant slowdown of their botnet after a few spam attempts, and  
take your weblog URL out of their list and leave you alone.

You could hook into "init". This will get you in fairly close to where
you are with the direct edits. There you could check if the request
is for wp-comments-post.php, and if so do your stuff.

I curious if anyone has tried this simple javascript strategy:

I'm pretty sure that spammers either blindly hit wp-comments-post.php,
or they grep through an obvious post page and look for the comment
form's action attribute and blindly post to what they find (which
somewhat defeats renaming it). What I don't think they do is fire up a
whole browser instance to parse the page and submit the form. Which
means things like javascript won't get executed. So I've added the
following innocuous line to my comment form:

<script type='text/javascript'>
document.write("<input type='hidden' name='random_number' value='" +
Math.round((Math.random() * 99) + 1) + "' >");
</script>

And then I add this to WP comments post:

if (!isset($_POST['random_number']))
	die( __('Error: please type a comment.') );

Results: virtually zero automated spam. Just the occasional vandal.
It'd actually be kind of cool to periodically cycle out the name of
the field.

It sounds like with "preprocess_comment" I could wrap this up into a
simple plugin instead modifying wp-comments-post.php

At least one of the comment anti-spam things does exactly that.  It was one 
of the non-captcha plugins, if I recall correctly.

Unfortunately, trackbacks don't require a form input. ;)

correct. I'd have the spammer start, say, 10 or 15 downloads on any  
given spamrun. That's also why I haven't made this into a public  
plugin. I host my own servers, and I can take a few extra downloads -  
most of them won't finish anyway.

Other would have to, say, point to a large bandwidth site such as  
akamai or microsoft, and of course I cannot advocate that at all.

But it sure works :-)

Instead of changing the script, I would highly recommend a plugin like 
Bad Behavior to complement your other spam protection measures.

    I considered 'preprocess_comment' since that's what Akismet uses, 
but wasn't sure if it was the best choice.  Anyone have a compelling 
explanation of which would be better, 'preprocess_comment' or 'init'? 
Or if there's something even better?

    Yeah, I figure that's usually the case.  But there may be those 
who, with zombienets and such, invest the effort in doing their own 
error detection, so they have a more efficient set of zombies.  I 
mean, if I were a spammer, that's what I'D do.  No sense wasting 
perfectly good zombies!  But maybe I think a little differently than 
spammers.  (God, I hope so.)  So I want to be as low-profile as 
possible for those who are being a little smarter than average.

    That's basically what I'm doing, except my approach doesn't use 
JavaScript, but an MD5 hash of the server name, current date, and the 
WP API key (with a string fallback for those who don't have such a 
key).  It's slightly less robust than the JS approach, but only for 
those spammers who aren't using JS-enabled engines to drive their 
spam.  One of the other posters mentioned botnets that use IE, which 
would use JS.  It's also more accessible to those who might be 
legitimately commenting with JS-disabled clients.  (Yes, they exist, 
and yes, I consider such things.)
    I realize this means that a spammer who actually uses the comment 
form on a post will get past this line of defense, but that's okay: I 
have other lines of defense.  This one is just meant to deflect all 
the direct-submission attackers, which may well be 90% of the spam I 
was getting.  That's a rectal statistic, I admit, but one that feels 
instinctually correct.  It may be proven very wrong over the next few 
weeks, of course.  So far, so good, though!

    Um, didn't I say I was trying to write my own plugin rather than 
permanently hack the script?  I'm pretty sure I said that.

with the caveat that BB can hit false-positives with many home-grown bot

for example.

that's not to say don't use it, just that you'd need to customize it... ;)

I think preprocess_comment is best for 2 reasons:
1) It doesn't fire off for *every* WordPress request, as does init, so
you're not wasting processing resources.
2) Of the filters/actions that do fire off only when a comment is
submitted to wp-comments-post.php, it's the first (assuming the
spammer hasn't left off any requisite fields, such as an email
address).

Yeah, I've wondered about that... Can you imagine the reduced load the
Akismet servers would experience if the blocked words filter came first.
Suddenly Akismet wouldn't have to deal with any comments containing the
words Poker, Casino, Texas or Holdem.  I think that just might make a
dent...

My wife's blog has blocked 40,000 spams, which I suspect is probably pretty
low compared to most of you.  If I take out my .htaccess blocking stuff,
that spam rate ramps up very quickly. I suspect a majority of these spams
were poker related and given the number of WP blogs out there, that must add
up.  

One thing that I am shocked about is that my personal blog, which I setup on
February 28, has received a grand total of 14 spam comments in three months.
Is it simply the fact that I've had Akismet on since the beginning?  I'm
certainly known to the search engines...  Somebody pointed out that my post
on 1and1 and PEAR was Google's #1 listing within the first 24 hours.  And if
I was found by several spammers, surely I would be found by more.  Now, I'm
not complaining, but I am surprised I don't get more comment spam...

A  temporary one for sure. It is a cat-and-mouse game. Set up a non-unique
filter and all defences will perish.

Gambling  spammers  can get the links even without the hyphenated  domains
(which  Matt Cutts recently said would lose advantage), or the anchor text
in the link.

Seems  like  the  .htaccess method, which I first read about in  Dvorak  <

popularised,  however,  it can be fooled (just like my CAPTCHA  which  got
hacked, allowing a flow of 200+ spam in the past 24 hours alone).

The  spammers are apparently using compromised Windows boxes to carry  out
the  floods.  Such Windows vulnerabilities and zombie armies also  account
for  80%  of  the global E-mail spam, according to Symantec. So  there  is
/one/   root   of   the  problem.  UIP  diversity  could  be   fought   by
fixing/replacing the operating system. But I'll digress...

I  would  happily  pass my spam over to you, in case you  feel  left  out.

 I posted a q in the support forums last night, before I begin writing a
perl script to chop up the old pages I'd like to get some opinions as to how
some of you folks would approach the following situation - 

existing/running site/blog - pretty busy 4-5 "topics" per day with 150-250
replies each. site has been running since '04 on typepad, all using "static"
html pages stored in "permalink" directories like -
date/topic/postname/index.html, where index.html contains the original post
plus all comments. I need to find a way to get this all pulled into wp. I
know that I can write a perl utility to chew up the pages and spit out
something suitable for wp import, however I'm kind of looking for the lazy
man's way out of this, thoughts ?? existing scripts/plugins, etc (which I
haven't been able to find or don't know about) ??

thanks....

This kinda stuff can be really bad, because certain "security"
software thinks that a good feature is NEVER sending referers to
websites.
I would be willing to wager that those same people think that
Wordpress sucks and "is broken".
Methinks the breakage exists a little closer in proximity to the user :P.

I thought you all might find this useful.

I wrote this Firefox extension that allows you to copy text as an HTML
link to the current page. Then you can paste the HTML into your blog
post or text editor or where ever you might need it. Since I prefer
not to use the TinyMCE wysiwyg editor, I find it very handy for
grabbing links to web sources.

That is a GREAT idea Justin.

You've inspired me!  I've created a similar tool for Maxthon and IE.  I've
been sure to send all Firefox users over to your blog and I've given you
credit for the inspiration in the installation tool.

You can find the .bat file that creates all the files and installs the menu
items in IE here:
http://www.thecodecave.com/2006/05/26/copy-as-text-link-and-copy-as-image-li
nk-blogging-tools/

That was a good idea... Justin.  Well done.  

This will save lots of time and typing. Though I'll have to be careful not
to be a bandwidth leech by linking to too many external pictures...

Message-ID: <9b1b9dab0605261719o187f99e8o303b4b539af561fe@mail.gmail.com>

I posted about this issue a while back and got no response. I have
since done some more research and hope someone has an idea that can
help me out-- this bug is killing me with my users!

The issue is this:

The current 2.0.2 WP upload facility, in conjunction with the editor,
mangles the links to uploaded files if the blog has a ~ in the path
and the user is posting with Firefox. The upload facility works fine,
the file is there, but the link that is produced when the file is
dragged to the editor changes from this:
http://www.site.com/~user/wp-content/uploads/image.gif
to
http://www.site.com~user/%7Euser/wp-content/uploads/image.gif

Fixing the link in HTML mode doesn't change the end result. This
happens with Firefox (windows) but not Internet Explorer.

This clearly seems to be a problem with the TinyMCE editing component
and the browser, but I don't know which is at fault. In the meantime,
after moving all our users off of IE, photo blogging and podcasting,
etc. are essentially impossible for them on our shared servers!

What happens if the user clicks and hits "Send to editor" instead of
dragging and dropping?

At  risk of prodding an OT discussion, I agree it's a great idea. However,
"view  source  selection" is two clicks away. After that,  CTRL+A,  CTRL+C
will  have  the same effect, with extra flexibility. On top on  that,  you
have the WordPress boomarklet, which takes the highlighted text, shifts it
to  the  composing area, links to its source, and grabs the page title  at
the  same time. It is a very nice combination, provided it doesn't collide
with browser extensions.

Just make sure you don't import (HotLink) some Flash or GIF's, which can
become animative... *smile*

I dove into the TinyMCE code and came up with a patch. You run it
against tiny_mce.js in wp-includes/js/tinymce.js. Get it here:

Perhaps it is better to have admin-functions.php:1123: as $theme_root

Err..  No... That would give you just the HTML source in your buffer.

Your method would paste something like this: <strong>NOT</strong>
Justin method would paste something like this: <a
href="www.thefullurl.com/to/the/orig/page.htm><strong>NOT</strong></a>

A big difference.

Agreed but it does it only once when creating the post right?

Anyway,I just wanted to clarify what the plugins actually did...

I just found http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2612 which describes
a similar problem but whose fix is invalid. Do I just add on this patch
there or open up a new ticket? Also, this being a TinyMCE bug, do
we need a WP ticket?

Usually I would urge reuse of an old ticket but that particular one is
just too far off the mark.

I'm sure nobody will mind helpful tickets on both WP's Trac and
TinyMCE's SourceForge.

Howdy all,
  I created a plugin API cheat sheet in PNG format.  It's 1280x1024,
so it's good for desktop backgrounds.

Is it normal for people to exceed the 8MB allotment to PHP with WP  
2.0.2? I've had to bump it up to 16MB. Maybe things  like  
$template_data in 1166 should be unset after each foreach loop?

I've always wondered if some of the performance issues on heavy WP 
installations could be alleviated with some aggressive memory 'debugging' of 
the codebase...

The general answer is, yes, I've seen many a WP install pass the 8MB mark --  
and I haven't a clue why in some cases. ;)

Smaller font size? Smaller resolution? Higher legibility? :) Of course,

Personally, I'd lose the hooks, and fill that with other info, like  
specific usages of things like add_management_page() with the params  
filled in.  The thing about the hooks is that knowing the name is  
only half the battle... you don't always know exactly where in the  
flow of things they are executed.  mce_buttons, mce_buttons_2,  
mce_buttons_3 ??? I'm going to have to go look those up anyway.  And  
you're never going to be able to fit all the hooks on there... there  
are just too many.  But that may just be me... I'm sure different  
people have problems remembering different things.  Oh, for  
add_filter/add_action... "accepted args" should probably be "# of  
accepted args" just to be clear.

Big kudos on taking the initiative on this!  I'm ALWAYS having to  
look stuff up, so a cheatsheet would really help me (I have a  
handwritten one for Gmail taped to my wall... has helped me a lot).

I've seen a few things knock WP over 8MB:

- more than about 2000 users (on /wp-admin/users.php)
	- SOLUTION: make a paging/search systems for users... on the todo list.
- Textile2 on pages with 60+ posts
	- SOLUTION: show fewer pages, don't use Textile2, debug Textile2 to  
use less memory

What page did you get that error on?

It would be nice to stay under 8MB in more situations (especially WP  
without any plugins!)  Many people are stuck at 8 and can't change  
it... so that's a big problem.

print_r($GLOBALS);  (please, please secure this...   <?php if  
( current_user_can('manage_options') && $_GET['dump_globals'] )  
print_r($GLOBALS); ?> ) will show what is being left open in the  
global space... in functions that use big arrays, we should unset  
whenever we can, to save memory.

 Is anyone aware of any documentation on format information for Moveable
Type/TypePad import file ? I have an entire site (over 10000 html pages (the
MT archive) containing each individual post+comments from I site I'm trying
to help someone move over to WP, I have created a set of scripts to extract
the data from the html files, now what I need to do is figure out how the
import file that a "dump" (which I don't have) of MT/TP is formatted so I
can then just try to use the existing WP import script rather than build a
custom one of those too. 

thanks...chris

Mark


http://ruckerz.oldbrownshoe.org/wp-admin/page-new.php and I got the  
error when the Page Templates in page-new.php were being loaded.


Interestingly, I did a memory_get_usage on the same page and got back  
3168424 bytes. Strange, something must have been going on when I got  
the error below that was pushing it above 8MB.  I recently lowered  
the memory limit to 8MB and everything seems to be working.  I think  
it was an aberrant plugin.

I wish there was a way to track memory leaks in php scripts :(

Thanks though,

FR

Excepting the uploading of images, I would say definately not. From my
brief study of 2.0.2 today, stock WP consumes less than half of the 8MB
limit leaving a comfortable buffer.

I have not yet looked at the effect of plugins. There are so many to
choose from and, ultimately, the memory use of each is a matter for
their authors.

Thanks for the feedback Mark.  I'll take it into consideration.  I
made the cheat sheets in the same vain as other cheat sheets, like
this one for Prototype:

http://www.snook.ca/archives/prototype1280.png

It's not supposed to teach you how to use the functions, it's for
people that already know how to use the stuff, but need a quick
reminder of, "Well, is that an action, or a filter?"  That kind of
thing.

Do at least want to slip in the # of args, and maybe what they are.

Nice one, Sean.

I bought the Visibone cheat sheets. This looks almost as good, although
my old eyes need a little more contrast to pick the filter and action
names out of the background.

A cheat-sheet for this kind of information isn't suited to my needs (I
use my editor and the source code) but I think a refined (and, who
knows, laminated :) version of this will be invaluable to new WordPress
programmers.

I know it says "2.0 API", but With 2.1 just around the corner and some
doggedly sticking to 1.5.x, how about symbols to denote version
compatibility, with 2.0.x the norm?

Hi all.  Does anyone have a full copy of ScriptyGoddess's Next/ 
Previous Posts in Category plugin they'd be willing to forward  
directly to me? It's usually here: http://www.scriptygoddess.com/ 
archives/2004/07/24/nextprevious-posts-in-same-category/ but  
scriptygoddess.com is currently down, and every single plugin list I  
find points to her website for the plugin instead of providing it.

Is there a plugin mirror site somewhere that I'm missing?

I captured most of the plugin via Google's cacheing mechanism but  
it's obviously damaged (no starting <?php tag for one thing) and  
there's no point in dissecting it to figure out how it works if I'm  
not sure if its brain is actually there.

thanks!

Paul,
  All excellent ideas!  And keeping with the open source spirit, here
are the two PSD files for the two cheat sheets:

http://www.headzoo.com/wpcs.zip

They are a bit of a mess... sorry. :)  But if you open them up in PS,
you'll find that the columns have an opacity of 81%, so if the
contrast isn't good enough for you, just bring them up to 100%.  The
slight transparency was just to let the WP logo show through anyway.
:)

 that would probably be better to just do a direct edit to the template/php
file you need, rather than attempt via plugin, just be sure to note which
files you've made any changes/edits to, so that you can carry those over
should you ever upgrade, etc, which might include a "replacement" for the
same files you've changed.

http://wphooks.flatearth.org/hooks/comment_form/

function my_inputs() {
	echo "<input name='just_work' type='checkbox' value='1'
checked='checked' />";
}

add_action( 'comment_form', 'my_inputs' );

As the link above states, however, this action is not guaranteed to be in
every theme.

This is what I'm doing now, but would prefer a more abstract solution so 
that themes will work in lyceum by default. As it is now, they require 
this hack: <http://lyceum.ibiblio.org/19>

Thanks for pointing this out. I've seen the comment_form action... as far 
as I can tell this can only be used to add lines within the form tags, and 
cannot be used to modify the form tags themselves. Am I mistaken?

Really?!  That's odd.  I thought I saved it with the backwards

My Linux box is bleeding-edge, so it's more likely one of /those/

Sorry for misreading your original message.

If you can depend on the client having Javascript, you can change the form
client side.  This is a little something I whipped up to do that.  I've
not debugged any of it.

In case the formatting gets messed up, it will be here for a while:

if ( isset($_POST['my_form_element']) ) {
        var_dump($_POST); // Do Something
        exit;
}

function my_comment_form() {
        echo "<input type='hidden' name='my_form_element' id='my_form_element' value='1' />";
}

        return get_settings( 'siteurl' ) . strstr(__FILE__, '/wp-content');
}

Hi Jeremy!

My corner of the internet is apparently not speaking to that corner,  
because I'm still getting a message that the site's not available.  
Could you send me a copy of the plugin via separate cover? Thanks so  
much!

I have to say I'm somewhat surprised that there isn't a public mirror  
of plugins somewhere, considering how small they generally are.

thanks!
anne

Lots of people on #wordpress have heard me ask for this, but in the  
next release, let's have an apply_filters('wp-content', ABSPATH . 'wp- 
content'); to a new function get_wpcontent_root() .

Yes this will cause a lot of grumbling from the plugin community, but  
get_theme_root already exists and get_wpcontent_root would only follow.

Hi Indranil,

<?php get_archives(); ?> is not truly a tag, but you can change its effect
directly by changing the function get_archives() to fetch article date from
the table and output it.

Here is where you can change this:

,----[ Snippet ]
| roy@BAINE:~/public_html/wordpress> fgrep -R 'function get_archives' *
|
| wp-includes/template-functions-general.php:function
get_archives_link($url,
|  $text, $format = 'html', $before = '', $after = '') {
|
| wp-includes/template-functions-general.php:function get_archives($type='',
|  $limit='', $format='html', $before = '', $after = '', $show_post_count =
|  false) {
`----

Best wishes,

Roy

I've got a pre-Alpha of CG-FlashyTitles 3 (yeah, skipping a number!) just 
barely limping along, using alpha sIFR 3 code and a somewhat-reengineered 
FlashyTitles codegen to make...


wait for it...


on-the-fly drop-shadowed titles!


Finally, you can do really sweet titles client-side...

I'll have a screenshot tomorrow, hopefully (it's working in the admin 
interface, just not on the blog...), and can start distributing a (weak) 
alpha version later in the week if there are folks who just can't wait. ;)

Oh, and just to be clear, drop-shadows aren't the only thing it'll do. 
Basically, I'm planning on having a drop-in 'effects' folder you can pick 
from, leveraging the Flash 8 core -- so it'll do shadows, knockouts, bevels, 
glows, you name it.  If Flash 8 filters support it, hopefully it'll be 
exposed.

Of course, the cooler effects require Flash 8, with a non-effects-font 
fallback to Flash 7, and a non-replacement fallback under any other case. 
So, there's certain disadvantages to it over say image-based 
server-generated methods -- but the advantages should be obvious as well.

And the sIFR 3 code should be much better at generating proper-sized 
replacements, rather than the weird spacing and 'shrinking fonts' issues 
seen in sIFR 2 (+ FlashyTitles 1).  Not to mention I should be able to 
remove a ton of the options from the admin panel, as less things need 
tweaking, more should 'just work', and advanced users can always add CSS 
directly when needed. :)

It is always a bad idea to hack the core files.  And by the way, the
function to start with should probably be wp_get_archives()
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_get_archives

But you should try the Customizable Post Listings plugin
http://www.coffee2code.com/archives/2004/08/27/plugin-customizable-post-listings/

That will do what you want without having to hack anything.

I forgot to mention that if you cannot depend on every client having JS
(and most likely in your case you cannot), you're stuck with output
buffering and regexing.

Message-ID: <000f01c68403$f86e8a00$0300a8c0@greenville>

 A couple of notes:

I've been doing a good amount of "customizing" existing WP core files as
well as plugins, etc. The cheat sheets are a great resource, however, they
are only a very small piece of the "BIG" puzzle. I'd like to say thanks to
Sean for sending along the PS files as well, the reason is that, I have been
taking the extra time as I work to document each change I make, including
documenting as best and completely as I can each function/hook, etc,
including accepted/required arguments, proper useage, what it actually does,
what file it lives in, etc. I've been trying to do all this without
duplicating works which I know already exist (see list below), with the
eventual goal of 1)adding/updating the correct and complete infor to the WP
codex, and posting a similar "dictionary" style listing of everything I've
needed to figure out, etc on my own website. I like the PS files because I
think they might make a great "template" for a website where each item is
more or less a "button" linked to the info for that particular item. 

In addition, so that those of you who are interested in or in need of this
type of API information you may or may not be aware of the following:

Codex - information updated as it becomes available/or someone takes the
time/effort to add it:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API

Wordpress "Action Hooks", source file location, params, useage,etc. as they
become available:
http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-2x-hooks-for-action-com
prehensive-list-for-plugin-and-theme-developers/

More WP "Hooks" info, again some documented completely, some not:
http://wphooks.flatearth.org/

Once again, I've been compiling as much info as I can on all of this, and so
hopefully some day I'll have some extra time to begin adding some of it to
the codex, as I do the work I need to, I've been adding to the above info as
I can find additional information or figure stuff out.

Personally, I'd lose the hooks, and fill that with other info, like specific
usages of things like add_management_page() with the params filled in.  The
thing about the hooks is that knowing the name is only half the battle...
you don't always know exactly where in the flow of things they are executed.
mce_buttons, mce_buttons_2,
mce_buttons_3 ??? I'm going to have to go look those up anyway.  And you're
never going to be able to fit all the hooks on there... there are just too
many.  But that may just be me... I'm sure different people have problems
remembering different things.  Oh, for add_filter/add_action... "accepted
args" should probably be "# of accepted args" just to be clear.

Big kudos on taking the initiative on this!  I'm ALWAYS having to look stuff
up, so a cheatsheet would really help me (I have a handwritten one for Gmail
taped to my wall... has helped me a lot).

You could have a look at WP-Gatekeeper[1] for an example; it's used
there to add a field to the comment form, so it should be pretty close
to what you want.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Can't get it working (Appache 2, WinXP, php4.34)
Message-ID: <018f01c68416$65d73f30$02001aac@CPQSATYAM>

I successfully followed the instructions to get the latest version using 
Tortoise SVN and have actually updated it every now and then.  I have 
successfully installed it, with all databases created as well as the admin 
account and can get to the admin screen but, if I try to either view the 
site or write a new post, it will kill the Apache server.  I have found 
reports of WP crashing Apache 1.3 and none of those apply in my case.  I 
have found nothing about Apache 2.0.  I have copied the .htaccess, with 
proper modifications (changing directories) from another working 
installation of a current stable release.  As I said, it is Apache 2.0, PHP 
4.3.5 over Windows XP with all services packs and updates.  The stable 
version is working just fine.

I single stepped through it with a debugger and it works nicely. I tried to 
trace it with die() (since my debugger got it working) and I thought I got 
it nailed to the right function but when I was closing in, it worked a 
little bit further.  I reached  get_categories()  in 
template-functions-category.php, then to apply_filters() in functions.php 
and from there to merge_filters() in the same source.  I thought I was 
closing on it when it just got through to a die() further down which it 
couldn't reach previously. I also checked some Apache and PHP bugs database, 
but can't find anything. var_dump()ed lots of arrays in the process, which 
didn't help me much anyway.

Thanks in advance for any help

I've noted that on the edit-pages.php page, with 300 pages, that the memory
limit is exceed almost all the time.  In addition, the page is horribly
slow, and I'm not sure why, since I can run the queries manually, and they
return fast.

Any idea what wp_db->get_results would be so slow?

The query isn't very efficient, since it fetches more data than it
uses (including post content, which will probably be larger than all
other fields combined).

page_rows() recurses but doesn't pass the $pages array by reference;
does that mean it's keeping n copies in memory (one per
hierarchy-level) while it walks the tree? That'd be murder on large
lists.

Message-ID: <ca7320070605301439l571275baj1dd6cd987588baaa@mail.gmail.com>

I posted this request on the forum earlier hoping to get some advice and not
trouble the hackers here. Having said that, I haven't gotten any takers and
this is very quickly becoming a major issue.  The original request is here:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/74244?replies=1

The question is is with 125+ blogs (some very heavy traffic), I am concerned
by an almost persistant error that we are getting now that appears to only
be with pinging, or something.  Entries are going through but this is very
annoying and could potentially not be pinging (not sure yet).  The error
that comes on universally every publish and edit is along the lines of:

INSERT INTO wp_postmeta (post_id,meta_key,meta_value) VALUES
('1349','_pingme','1')

WordPress 2.0.2, 3 web servers on a round-robin basis, 1 database server,
heavy optimization performed.  We are well below max concurrent connections
(though the number of connections is still high many times), mysql cache has
been optimized.  Wondering if a guru out there has any advice on how to get
this fixed, whether it's an optimized query or function I can push or
something more on the system level.  I'm open to suggestions but one thing
is sure, I need to find the cause and I need to find it soon.'

Help?

Yeah, I hacked my code at one point to only grab the post_excerpt field on a 
multi-post query... much better. ;)

Oops, hit the send button. My bad. The error is the query above with a
"Can't send headers, headers already sent error".   I guess more
specifically it would be:

 *WordPress database error:* [Lost connection to MySQL server during query]
 INSERT INTO wp_postmeta (post_id,meta_key,meta_value) VALUES
('107','_pingme','1')

*Warning*: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by

This is a MySQL server error, not related to WordPress. Usually this is 
caused by:

* MySQL dying
* wait_timeout too low
* Custom DB code closing the connection

The header errors are only because of the MySQL error.

I should note that I posted about this error many moons ago, as it spawned 
multiple discussion threads about what it meant.  Always seemed to be the 
_pingme stuff, no other problems.

I vaguely remember that. I couldn't find it in the archives though.

The only thing that I see in that list is the wait_timeout and that was
already at 40 seconds. I just bumped that to 50 and republished an entry.
Same error. I suppose I'll try 60, then 70 then 80... But this is not the
answer.  Why is this query taking up so much time and energy from the
server? The server has been optimized... over-optimized... continually
monitored and refactored for demand.  It's not custom code as it is
happening on every single blog, every single time a publish/edit is done and
some of these blogs are off the shelf, no custom code.

Right on, except for the hacking part. We have filters like
posts_requests for that kind of thing, plus a recently-added filter
called "posts_fields". :-)

I still disagree with the idea of using plugins to fix a severe
problem like this, where a fix should be in the core and the
additional functionality of grabbing more fields could be done by
plugin.

This is a problem on par with the users page... maybe even worse,  
because there are more sites with hundreds of pages than there are  
sites with hundreds of users.  The pages one is difficult, in that we  
can't just do simple paging... because we have tree structure to keep  
intact.

One solution (assume 5 WP pages per management page... it would  
obviously be much higher in reality):

===(page 1 of 2)===
- Top Level Page 1
---- Subpage 1A
---- Subpage 1B
---- Subpage 1C
---- Subpage 1D

===(page 2 of 2)===
- Top Level Page 1
---- Subpage 1E
- Top Level Page 2
---- Subpage 2A
---- Subpage 2B
===============

As you can imagine, it gets tricker when you have to handle deeper  
depths of pages.

Another solution is to do a tree structure but only show one level at  
a time.

===
- Top Level Page 1
- Top Level Page 2
- Top Level Page 3
===

Clicking any page gets you a display with that page and its immediate  
children.  Clicking its children gets the child as the parent, with  
any grandchild pages shown as children.  Then, if you need to do  
paging, you do it within that group of immediate children.

===
- Top Level Page 2
---- Subpage 2A
---- Subpage 2B
---- Subpage 2C
===

You'd need search functionality too.

Agreed.  We can't write off these edge cases, whereby core  
functionality is hindered.  From a PR standpoint (which isn't the POV  
most of us have, this is just in addition to the "because we can make  
it better" argument), these edge cases with 1000s of users or  
hundreds of pages may well act as the shining examples of WordPress  
as a serious engine for specific CMS needs.  We could have a big  
company display a big tree of its products and product categories via  
WordPress pages or have a school give every student a commenting or  
posting account on a school news blog.

Could the page heirarchy be stored in a serialized array a la widgets?

A la rewrite rules. This makes good sense if it's not too heavy.

Moreover, if these types of things that affect large sites aren't 
addressed directly, then when a large site does use WordPress, the bad 
press from their first post-WP Drupal post could be pretty killer.

Are we actually discussing the value of patching this? Nobody has said
"don't patch it." Is anybody raising their hand to write the patch?
