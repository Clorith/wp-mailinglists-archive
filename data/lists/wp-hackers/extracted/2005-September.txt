This looks like one of 3 (or 4) methods of uploading photos in Gallery
(re-use?), only with a visual progress bar, which can probably be composed of
GIF animations if necessary.

Not a visual progress bar (NOTE: yet..). PHP doesn't support any
methods of finding the status of a file upload in another thread (like
Ruby on Rails does). There are patches for PHP, but it'll be a while
before they're installed on enough machines for us to get use out of
them.

I understand your point. In that case, rather than worry about PHP
patches/compatibility, use a workaround solution. Fragment the file at the
user's end, then upload and merge at the end. The user knows how many 
so-called
'packets' are sent and can use AJAX-like technique to modify solely the 
state of
the bar in (almost) real-time. There would be a performance penalty, 
but it can
win over dial-up users, who are often left in the dark as far as progress is
concerned.

Javascript doesn't have direct access to files, thus it can't be done.

this sounds like a perfect candidate to have a place in the empty

it can be as per the personal preference of the author, whether he wants 
to see
the ping stats after publishing a post or not. this way those who want 
it can have it
enabled via their "Personal Options" and those who doesn't want it can 
keep it
disabled. I suggest that this can be kept disabled by default, so that 
the new users
or non-techy people don't have a problem finding the place to disable 
it.

This solution requires a patch to PHP; most hosts will not apply this patch.

After researching this pretty well myself, I would say that there is no 
way for the majority of web servers that are installed with standard 
options to implement a progress bar for upload, either via javascript or 
a server-side method.  There is no magic Ajax that will accomplish this 
feat.

However, the original idea of uploading multiple files via javascript 
and an iframe is certainly doable.

1. 5.2 and 1.6 have both put patches for the same exact problem that
plugin hacks around, so yes, its useless.

Disagree completely. I'd advocate taking a leaf from the Firefox team's 
philosophy and carefully limit/constrain visible options to a carefully 
considered core set.

This is the sort of value that should not be a visible option.

Has anybody looked at the solution here: http://www.raditha.com/megaupload/

I've only looked at it briefly. It requires perl, but most servers have 
that. I even got working on my win32 dev box without much trouble. It 
might be a nice stop gap until php is patched.

have you bothered to look at what I was quoting?? Here it is if you

so ofcourse if you are gonna show some visual confirmation to the user 
as to what's happening(like 'pinging'),
then that should be made optional!! There's no harm in making it 
optional, so the authors who want to
see when WP is pinging etc. they can enable the option.

I think that you mis-understood what I was saying & thought that 
'pinging' should be made optional, etc.

Actually, there is harm in making it optional. Filling option screens
with trivial options is the fastest way to guarentee a confused user.
Options should be precious and only a select few should be available.
Options are so often used as a lazy way of deciding a dispute: instead
of making a decision one way or another, the developers stick an
option in. This is not the way it should be.

See http://www106.pair.com/rhp/free-software-ui.html, specifically the
section on 'The Question of Preferences'. Here, no value is gained by
adding the option: those that are techy enough to understand the
'Pinging X' output probably also understand that big DB dumps and RPCs
may take some time.

I say we take Owen's suggestion about linking to a seperate pinger on
the next page, or Matt's with the iframe. Either way is good: someone
should set up some proof-of-concepts for both and we'll see how they
compare.

Isn't it likely that "pinging" will grow get more sophisticated, that  
technorati and other places might start returning interesting  
information upon getting a ping?

Perhaps more reason to break out ping as a after post event which is  
(optionally) visible to the user instead of hidden.

I like a post-post (heh) UI approach.

1) Blog post is written to database and made available...
2) User is given feedback:

         Post published. Ping listening services now?

             [ ] Yes  [ ] No  [ ] Always do this

3) Ping process starts, perhaps in a self-closing pop-up window (or  
Dom created i-Frame).

The 'when to ping servers' dialog could be javascript based, on the  
web page, or in a pop-up, or an intermediate page targeted after  
updates.

Also, maybe have a preference for when remote sites are pinged  
(though this might involve a cron...):

     a) upon posting
     b) 2x day if new posts exists

etc.

It sounds appealing to me and possibly many others, but the philosophy

step to a goal, every extra option is one to worry about as a new or

Ok. Right now pinging is basically just 'add rpc.pingomatic.com' to your 
update services. The only problem to solve here is a speed issue, in 
some cases. To solve this, the above solution is that we're gonna gonna 
add a dialog box, a popup box (basically another dialog--one that just 
closes itself randomly!), and a preference and a reference to cronjobs?

Stick the pinging in an iframe; be done with it :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Separation of Application Logic from Presentation
	Logic; a big hack I made
Message-ID: <f290d56f05090111197352fd6f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

For my own purposes, I modified WordPress 1.5.2 so that almost all of
the presentation logic has been separated from the application logic.

They don't know me from a hole in the wall, but I thought this might
be useful to the WordPress developers. In addition to making it easier
to make layout refinements, it could also make the application code
easier to read and maintain.

I realize my method (using the Smarty Templating Engine) might not be
everyone's favorite, but it ensures a strict separation of form from
function.

I called my hack SmartyPress and have put it at
http://smartypress.biggerplanet.com .

I'm a great fan of WordPress and have used it many times for many
purposes -- but almost never as a regular blog. I thank its developers
for its creation and maintenance, and I hope my hack is, if not useful
to them as-is, at least a testament to my love of WordPress.

non-savvy user.

I just wanted to agree with the sentiments of some others - the last thing you want to do is make things take longer. Having to click "Yes" again after posting would be terrible, I think. Having an option to show the pinging progress (set to Yes by default) seems OK to me, but I would lean towards just doing it. Less options, more better.

Subject: [wp-hackers] pinging improvements
Message-ID: <43175E7A.3080704@skippy.net>

The concern with pinging stems from the fact that my blog gets bogged
down as it tries to connect to all the different links in my post to let
them know that I linked to them.

But my blog is also contacting Ping-O-Matic to let them know that I've
updated, so they can update all the various sites that care.

Can we perhaps combine the two?  Can I ping PoM, and send along a list
of the links in my post, so that PoM can ping those sites on my behalf?

I have no idea how feasible or desirable this may be, long-term, but it
seems like a decent idea.

Thoughts?

Wow, awesome work! I hope something like this gets moved into the core
soon. Although, I'm interested to hear justification on some of your
design decisions; primarily why smarty was chosen instead of sticking
with the PHP-based template-tag style templates WordPress already uses
for themes?

That could be done with Pingback, at least.
One advantage of doing pingbacks with pingomatic is that it could try
to remember just which sites do not have a pingback server, so as to
avoid pinging them. That could be done in WP itself, but think of the
resources saved "worldwide" if it was from a single location...

Hmmm, that's a very interesting idea! I can't speak for Matt, but I just 
haven't had as much time as I'd like to make improvements to 
Ping-O-Matic. I've already got several other new features that I've been 
wanting to add for a long time, but I just don't have the free cycles to 
work on them.

This code is written and needs testing:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1644

It should be tested to see what it does when there is more than one ping 
to send, and verify that everything is working as expected.

It sounds like a wonderful idea, but PoM has been going down quite
often nowadays, so if anything we should keep the current pinging
methods as a backup for when PoM is not working.

iirc, WordPress dropped support for smarty becuase it was a hassle to
maintain and seems to be slightly harder to explain, as well as lose
some customizability of themes. I think for a hosted WordPress
platform where you don't want PHP available in files, this might work,
but for a self hosted blog like the majority of WordPress' audience
its best to stick with PHP.

Adding anything in another language becomes a sudden support hole, and
showing more requirements will surely lose us some users.

Thanks. I hope the same thing.

Why did I use Smarty? I think the Smarty developers describe the
benefits better than I can in the opening paragraphs at:
http://smarty.php.net/rightforme.php ,
http://smarty.php.net/whyuse.php , and
http://smarty.php.net/manual/en/preface.php .

To me, a better question is, why didn't WordPress use Smarty? I
confess I don't have my finger on the pulse of the WordPress
community, but I do know in the past, Smarty was mentioned as part of
WordPress's future. I can only speculate, but I suppose it may not fit
in with the stated philosophy of "keeping the core code as light and
fast as possible."

Point is that WordPress doesn't _need_ it to function, so it has to
be, indeed, as lightweight as possible. Adding requirements or
features is always one of the nicer topics on the list ;)

But yeah. About it. Lightweightness is cooler than feature bloat?

well said, adding smarty will add another 400-500KB of weight to the 
baggage
if I'm not wrong. Besides, I don't see any reason as to why Smarty is to 
be used, just because
instead of using

    foreach ($comments as $comment)

you use

    {foreach from=$comments item=comment}

or instead of

    if ('unapproved' == $comment_status) {
    }

you use

    {if $comment->status=='unapproved'}
    {/if}

I mean where is the sense?? That's doing just the same thing with an 
added overhead!!
I say, someone gotta have a ridiculous sense of humour if they say that
    {foreach from=$comments item=comment}
is easier than
    foreach ($comments as $comment)

Are we thinking about making WordPress faster & lighter or bloating it??

Committed.  I didn't test it much yet.  Everyone pile on and see how it 
handles.

We might need to add a ping trigger for xmlrpc posting.

What might be a good solution, is the use of a new IRI design for
feeds and trackbacks. I'm currently using this on my site:

http://domain.ext/archive/yyyy/mm/post-slug
-> feed: http://domain.ext/syndicate/yyyy/mm/post-slug
-> trackback: http://domain.ext/trackback/yyyy/mm/post-slug

I don't need to tell you my robots.txt contains the following:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /syndicate/
Disallow: /trackback/

How cool is that?

ok, that I said earlier, I didn't make those remarks to offend some one, 
because I know that my remarks have a sarcasm in them, I don't deny 
that!! And no, I didn't intentionally pick the bad examples to highlight 
instead of good examples, but given at that URL, 
http://smartypress.biggerplanet.com/2005/08/31/smartypress-what-and-why/ 
the code shown, take a look at it & tell me how its better? Seperating 
application logic from design logic is what its labelled as, but all I 
see is that instead of <?php ?>, { & } are being used and the logic has 
a bit different syntax, the "foreach" loop is still there & so is the 
"if" condition, they can't be removed, whether you use a template engine 
like Smarty or use PHP directly, they can only be removed by doing the 
loop etc. in PHP putting a variable there, either of PHP or Smarty. So 
tell me, is there any difference to the code except that its more 
bloated now & will take more overhead to process?

And is my question "Are we thinking about making WordPress faster & 
lighter or bloating it??" not justified?

If you can justify it, then I'd sure be glad to hear the reasoning 
behind it!! :)

 From a web architecture standpoint, that's a step backwards, if WP were 
to adopt it... ideally there should only be one uri per item and what's 
returned (atom, rss, xhtml, pingback uri, etc) would be determined by 
the request HTTP headers.

Also I think the point of the disdain for nofollow is that the spammers 
really don't care what the search engines are following or not 
following, they're gonna keep spewing their stuff via bots anyway.

That's what I get for not reading the whole discussion before posting; I 
just realized that the usage of nofollow being suggested here had

Hey all,

I think Amit has the right idea here. PHP itself is a templating
engine so why go and bloat the code with Smarty which is essentially a
convoluted replacement of PHP code? I tend to agree with this template
engine author says about using PHP based templates:

http://www.massassi.com/php/articles/template_engines/

In all however, I like WP's template solution (not the admin panel
side) very well. If the complaint is that the admin section cannot be
templated easily, why not just write the admin section to have
templates like the blog pages?

That's an excellent idea. A shame that many blogs out there still have their
PageRank diluted due to (?trackback and) feed URL's...

That's also a valid point. It need to be done carefully though. I once 
appended
?from_rss to all URL's contained within feeds in order to perform some
temporary tracking. Little did I know that my feeds were getting 
indexed and so
did the URL?from_rss variants, which meant that I had duplicate (up to 
3) pages
indexed for each entry (%#@!). After some discussion, I immediately 
reverted to
the older version and flushed the duplicates.

I suspect that if HTTP headers were used, the case would be different, 
but I am
not too familiar with that functionality... not enough to comment on it 
anyway.

yeah, that's right. Even if you don't link directly to any URI's in 
comments & link them via a redirector script, the spammers hardly care, 
I bet they don't even know, they just have a list of 
websites/blogs/forums which they feed into their bots & start spamming 
them. :(

Two of my blogs still respect the "no nofollow" mantra. Until not long ago I
came to witness spam coming to an /almost complete halt/. So, it was fair to
conclude that spammers did not 'snatch' any opportunities. It is hard to come
up with a search engine criterion for 'blog that honours all links' unless the
blog explicitly states something to that effect in its body.

More recently, spam bounced up again to a lump of 50-100 a day. It does not
appear as if spammers have time (READ: will bother) to check if rel="nofollow"
is embedded. As a matter of fact, you can get rel="nofollow" links highlighted
in red if you install the SearchStatus extension for Firefox, which is 
worrying
when you think of spammers. Before I got it installed (version 1.9 or 
later), I
had to highlight text and "View Source Selection", which is hard if you 
inspect
an entire page that is filled with links.

has anybody noticed the following:

http://del.icio.us/robots.txt

I was a little curious this morning, that's all...

Please take a layman's point of view for a minute, and open the
default theme's sidebar.php.
Come back and tell us how intelligible it is.

An hypothetical switch to Smarty shouldn't be about blanket string
replacement of PHP stuff into Smarty stuff. It should come with a
re-thinking of the templates: for example, just because you can use
conditionnals doesn't mean you should.

As for templating the admin area, there's just so much logic in there
that the best we could do is come up with the best markup, the most
meaningful plugin hooks, and call it a day. Then let people use
alternate stylesheets if they want to.

"Allowed keys" for orderby var really should include 'modified'. But
since it doesn't... Beside an edit to classes.php, can I override or
append to the $allowed_keys array under get_posts in WP_Query class?

I'm writing a how-to for a Page template that includes a feature for
selecting sort method: title, date and modified, and I'd like a way
for someone to accomplish the last without requiring an edit to the
core.

Firstly, I'd like to see a version of the sidebar.php template using
Smarty that's so much clearer.

Secondly, the end user shouldn't ever see the Smarty templates for the
admin. Only the WP devs, and they're certainly not laymen. It's not
about making things as simple as possible for those without an
understanding of PHP, that would be misintepreting our target audience
here.

But lets think about the big picture for a second. WordPress has been
in progress for years now. The original WP core is old, and it shows
in a lot of places. In my opinion, WordPress needs major refactoring,
seperating out the distinct layers of database, then logic, then
display (a kind of MVC setup). This project is an attempt to remove
the display code from the logic code, and it's a great idea. Keeping
all the markup for the admin in one place will save a lot of time in
the long run. So lets not discard it completely. On the other hand,
I'm not advocating a removal of every last line of PHP from the
templates: IMO, logic, to an extend, is a useful part of templating.

Your best bet for the long run is to file a bug report. Sadly, that
would likely only get included in the next major release.

Well, I haven't looked into it at all, so don't take my response as
the authoritative answer; I was just suggesting the route to take if
there were no options available currently.

Already followed that road because as I noted, I believe it belongs
in there. But something tells me (by the lack of a solution to be
found, as I've done some digging), that your response will end up
being just as good as an authoritative one.

In classes.php, you have around lines 540-580:

$orderby = apply_filters('posts_orderby', $orderby); 

$request = " SELECT $distinct * FROM $wpdb->posts $join WHERE 1=1".$where."
ORDER BY " . $orderby . " $limits";

$this->posts = $wpdb->get_results($request);

So posts_orderby is likely an option for you. I recall I suggested at one
point that there should be a last minute filter like:

$request = apply_filters('posts_request', $request); 

I still think it would be useful. And if all else fails, a little later you
have:

$this->posts = apply_filters('the_posts', $this->posts);

Which allows to completely trash and redo the query.

Hope this helps,

D.

Why would you need/want to template the admin section anyway? Aside from 
cases where you want to majorly rebrand the admin interface, only a 
small handful of people will ever see those pages.

Not too mention the fact that the admin pages are signifigantly more 
complex than most wordpress theme pages are ("header -> post(s) -> footer")

That could be a must, since lately I have seen many users jumping to
programs like ecto o w.bloggar, (they have some pinging options by
themselfs) but, when you ping more than one site (for example, I a
spanish blogger, ping to several directory's besides PoM) so this added
trigger could be a relief for users like me...

There's still ease of maintenance to keep in mind. Separating all the
display logic into one place, regardless of whether Smarty is used or
not, makes it easier to find or edit the display section independant
of the application logic.

The little example on my site wasn't meant to justify the use of
Smarty, just illustrate what I did.

My justification for using Smarty is just like the justification for
using an object-orient programming language over a strictly procedural
one: an object-oriented language offers a structure (or may impose a
structure) a programmer can (or is forced to) use to encapsulate
different parts of logic from one another. This structure, especially
when it is imposed, is not computationally free, and can be harder to
learn. Yet when properly used, it leads to code that is easier to
maintain, easier to reuse, and easier to expand upon.

Some people would disagree with that assertion, and obviously this is
not the place for the OOP vs. non-OOP debate. My justification for
using Smarty is that it imposes encapsulation, has been developed by
people much smarter than me, and so is a better conceived and executed
method of abstraction than I could invent even if I had the time to do
so. For me personally, and I would imagine in a project with multiple
people working on it, a strictly imposed structure, if it is well
conceived, leads to a better structured program. I believe Smarty was
well conceived and is well executed.

Here is a very simple example of what I mean by encapsulation. In
`wp_admin/edit.php`, we have:

	if ( ('none' != $comment_status) && ($user_level >= 3) ) {
		if ('approved' == wp_get_comment_status($comment->comment_ID)) {
			echo " - <a href=\"post.php?action=unapprovecomment&amp;p=" . 
				$post->ID."&amp;comment=".$comment->comment_ID."\">" .
					__('Unapprove') . "</a> ";
		} else {
			echo " - <a href=\"post.php?action=approvecomment&amp;p=" .
				$post->ID."&amp;comment=".$comment->comment_ID."\">" .
				__('Approve') . "</a> ";
		}
	}

This is the opposite of abstraction -- the user's level is compared to
the hard-coded value of 3, for example, and the output is generated
directly as a result.

While working through my hack, it was easy to see that this hard
comparison was less than ideal, and could change in the future --
deciding whether or not the user had permission to approve comments
certainly didn't belong in the template. The template only knows what
you explicitly tell it -- this is what I mean by an imposed
encapsulation -- so you must make a decision about every piece of
information. So my version has:

	$smarty->assign('can_approve_comments', $user_level >= 3);

in `edit.php` and:

	{if $comment->status != 'none' && $can_approve_comments}
		{if $comment->status=='approved'}
			- <a href="post.php?action=unapprovecomment&amp;
				p={$post->ID}&amp;comment={$comment->comment_ID}">
			{$labels.Unapprove}</a>
		{else}
			- <a href="post.php?action=approvecomment&amp;
				p={$post->ID}&amp;comment={$comment->comment_ID}">
			{$labels.Approve}</a>
		{/if}{* / comment status *}
	{/if}{* / can approve comments *}

in the template. This is not about syntax, this is about abstraction.
This is  so the template doesn't need to know how a decision is made.
(Ideally it wouldn't be using string constants, e.g., `approved`,
`none`, to check the comment's status.)

No, Smarty isn't the only way to do this. But just as I wouldn't try
to write a WordPress from scratch when such a beautiful job has been
done with it already, so I wouldn't try to write a templating library
when Smarty let me hit the ground running.

I completely understand the desire to keep WordPress small, light, and
manageable. I've never managed or maintained an open source project,
so I would never pretend to understand how difficult it could be, but
my feeling is that the hard work of writing and maintaining a template
library has been done -- isn't the point of open source to leverage
one another's work? Smarty would add 500K or so to WordPress's size,
but it would be 500K of well written, well maintained, and field
tested code.

IMHO Atom 1.0 is a must-do upgrade.

See <http://mathibus.com/examples/wp-atom> (add the .phps extension if
necessary; I'm using MultiViews but IE doesn't quite seem to handle
those very well) for my cleaned-up version of wp-atom.php, which
(besides the cleaning up part) also adds support for categories with
HTML in their title. I deem this to be the most perfect wp-atom.php
out there for use on any WordPress install. Suggestions? Do let me
know.

In 1.6, this is done as current_user_can('approve_comments'), a definite
improvement over the user level checks.

Your point about abstraction is well taken.  That's why hundreds of
lines of code have been moved out of the templates in 1.6.  More things
are abstracted with objects and template functions.  This effort to
encapsulate and abstract will continue and could use any help people
want to provide.

I'd rather not redo all of WP's field tested code in Smarty.  Instead,
let's stick with PHP and just make the code better.  Bad code can be
written in both PHP and Smarty.  Let's write good PHP code.  Plus,
abstracting the existing application code would benefit any future move
to a template engine, should such a thing happen.

So, let's continue to clean up the admin templates by moving the heavy
lifting into functions.  I'd like to eliminate direct DB calls from the
templates as much as possible and improve code reuse.

iirc, last time someone asked about a comments atom feed Matt said it
had been intentionally left out because he didn't think Atom would be
the way of the future. Back then, I may not have agreed entirely, but
at this point we must face that RSS is going to be the way of the near
future, with its support in IE7 being a major reason why. Not to say
that Atom support should be dropped entirely, but I don't think its
something that much time should be spent on.

Think you could update it to be 1.6-friendly and submit a patch? :-)

Actually, Matt's justification has been that it hadn't exited draft 
status yet.

This discussion is a black hole and a lot of very smart people have 
given into the negativity involved with bickering about it, but IE7 will 
support Atom:

You should report this directly to the plugin's author.  This is a list

You are fast. But also right. I couldn't find Owen's contact details
anywhere on his site so opted to post here, since I noticed he is a
subscriber. My bad. Btw...you wouldn't happen to know where I should go to
discuss WP plugin development with other plugin authors?

Excellent question.  #wordpress on Freenode is usually a good place.  
There are usually a few people there who know what they are talking 
about.  If the question is one of "I wish I could do this, but I can't, 
because WordPress needs this hook" then it would fit on this list, as it 
rather addresses the direction you'd like to see WordPress go to fit 
your needs.

The WordPress forums [1] are more for end-user support than developer 
support.  There are many good articles on the Codex [2], but it's not 
very interactive.  I've actually been thinking that having developer 
message boards would be nice.  Mailing lists have their place, but they 
are no substitute.  #wordpress can often give you instant feedback, but 
it is transient.  Developer message boards would definitely get a vote 
from me.

Yes it would be nice to have some kind of forum where plugin developers
could bounce ideas, exchange code, report bugs etc. off one another.

Does it handle enclosures properly?

I had to hack at feed-functions.php and create an atom_enclosure 
function as the rss_enclosure function that was being used for 
wp-atom.php was fine for RSS but all wrong for Atom.

Whoops, looking back, I see that Michael Huynh already said it :)

David House says:
   "Secondly, the end user shouldn't ever see the Smarty
   templates for the admin. Only the WP devs, and they're
   certainly not laymen."

Don't be so sure. There are plenty of WP sites out there run by people 
who pretty much don't know the first thing about coding. And they 
shouldn't have to. That's one of the things WP is good at: it's a good 
tool whether you're a web novice or an expert PHP programmer.

Jeff Minard says:
   "Why would you need/want to template the admin section
   anyway? Aside from cases where you want to majorly
   rebrand the admin interface, only a small handful of
   people will ever see those pages."

Again, not necessarily the case. It might be useful to have different 
admin interfaces for different admins or site types. A "novice" admin 
template could avoid cluttering things up with advanced options that 
might not ever get used. Some sites might benefit from an interface 
geared more heavily towards managing pages than posts and comments.

Granted, templatizing the admin section is a more complicated endeavor 
than content templates. Maybe we'll decide that admin templates aren't 
needed. But I think that there might be enough use-cases to make it 
worth consideration, at least.

Dougal,

Last wednesday on our blog, we started a clearinghouse for donors to
give directly to Katrina victims.  Since then, we have been flooded with
responses and are linked by everyone, most importantly
Hurricanehousing.org which is sending everyone to us.  People from
around the world want to contribute and they're using our site to do so.

We need to move away from Typepad IMMEDIATELY and upgrade to Wordpress.

Can you *PLEASE link us up with someone who knows Wordpress  inside and
out *to help us set this up?  Time is of the essence here.  (This would
be a great way to contribute to the Katrina evacuees, and we would be
more than happy to acknowledge the person's contributions on the
Clearinghouse.)

The link to the site is:       http://beenthere.typepad.com/been_there/

Thank you, Emily McKhann (914) 632-3336

I got this message as well, I guess they sent it out to several people.

I'd be happy to provide hosting if someone else can walk through the 
actual template work they need.

Then why not a php XML-RPC client? all the rebranding stuff, in a custom

That's far less likely to be used. The required effort to add more RPC 
API hooks for general administration (beyond posting/editing posts), 
*plus* writing clients to take advantage of it probably wouldn't be 
worthwhile. If someone were interested in undertaking such a project, 
however, the RPC API can be extended via the 'xmlrpc_methods' filter.

Hanni,

Should you have any issues I would be glad to help out. I did a TP->WP 
somehat recently, and had to face numerous issues, especially with respect 
to permalinks and such, and you could reuse some of that expertise if you 
like.

Carthik.

For those volunteering are you actually letting the person who
requested help know? I'm pretty sure they aren't subscribed to the
list so just replying here isn't going to do much.

Sorry for replying to my own message. I just wanted to make sure that 
everyone know sthat if you're interested in helping with this project, 
please contact Ms. McKhann directly, rather than replying to me or to 
wp-hackers. Going through me as a conduit will just slow things down, as 
I don't have anything to do directly with the site.

I'm sure she'd welcome as much help as she can get, as she seems to want 
  to get things rolling as quickly as possible.

Thanks!

Couple of questions:
1) Is there any reason why there isn't a built-in function to determine
if the current page has child pages? page_haschildren()
2) Does anyone have an existing function that will do this?
3) If not, if I build it, what would it take to get it into the core?
(I've seen a number of people looking for this capability.)

err, I think he meant to say that only the WP devs mess around with the

templates!! :)
So if you are a layman, then you shouldn't be messing around the PHP 
code anyway, Smarty or not!!

If you announce a new / upgraded plugin in the forums, to save you 
having to keep an eye on threads that may contain out-of-date problems 
or have multiple threads for the same code, if you post to the old 
thread, reference the new announcement url and then ask for that thread

Great, good suggestion.

I suppose it would make it even easier if we added a mod_look tag to it as well?

Subject: [wp-hackers] phpsuexec and .htaccess
Message-ID: <4323F253.1090700@tamba2.org.uk>

I posted this to the forums, but then realised this could be the better 
place :)

--
Moving to a new host

PHP version 4.3.11
Apache version 1.3.33 (Unix)
phpsuexec is running somewhere

Problem:
.htaccess is not generated, written to or even seen.

What I have done:
Fresh 1.5.2 code, set .htaccess to 666 generated default permalinks. WP 
reports NO error, but .htaccess is not modified.
Removed the .htaccess - exactly the same thing - no error reported.
Set permissions on the .htaccess to 644, try to update and again get a 
success message.

Repeated all that with the latest code.

I have copied a .htaccess from the previous host and then things work - 
but if I add a Page, that 404's because the .htaccess is not written to.

So without the .htaccess, it's back to un-pretty links, but why is WP 
not reporting errors when it should be ?

 From their support:
"runs PHP as CGI. This is a security feature called phpsuexec. You will 
need to check with the script maker for any support involving running 
their script with phpsuexec and to see if this issue (not generating a 
correct .htaccess file) is common on servers running phpsuexec or what 
other issue or feature can be causing your issue. Mod_rewrite is active 
on all servers "
They helpfully indicate that I might find some help for this problem in 
these forums :)

I've done all I know and it's definitely this phpsuexec that is throwing 
the spanner in the works - what can I do / try next ?

phpinfo if it helps: http://www.blackroseimmortal.com/a.php
(It's a friend's domain I now host)

I'm not sure what you mean, Pete, but anyway the feed validates as
Atom 1.0 so I don't think there's a problem. I didn't make any of
those changes though... ??? Please check the source code
<http://mathibus.com/examples/wp-atom> and see if it's okay.

As usual, I've not been clear.
No matter if there is or is not a .htaccess, or what it's permissions 
are, WP reports "Permalink structure updated."
It lies :)

Sorted - I think.

I had to use the reduced rewrite plugin by Ryan:
http://boren.nu/archives/2005/03/07/reduced-rewrite-plugin/

I haven't yet got a clean way of doing this as I was using a blog I 
could wipe out, but I deleted everything, including the DB.
Reinstalled
Activated the plugin
Set the Rewrite rules I wanted
Put this single line into .htaccess
RewriteRule ^(.+)$ /index.php/$1
and now I can create what I want.

BUT
Urls that were like this:
www.example.com/date/category/title
become
www.example.com/index.php/date/category/title
which when I have to migrate my blog, will break every post and comment 
permalink (that's around 6000 broken urls).

--

Not in forum.
Is this a host / phpsuexec / WP issue ? I'm not bothered about Google, 
PR and that stuff, but someone who was would find this more than annoying.
Switching hosts is a possibility, but unless I know what the problem 
was, what to ask for or about I could walk into the same situation.

Sounds like you put /index.php/ in the permalink structure in
your configuration.  You should leave it out.

That sounds like the rewrite is not taking effect in your .htaccess
file at all.

Using the first permalink structure should work together with
the rewrite rule you posted, by redirecting the request through
index.php.

Of course, usually I've seen a two-liner, not just a single rule,
like this:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.+)$ /index.php/$1 [L,QSA]

With a one-liner (the last line of the two), unless Apache had
some clever internal checking, you might end up in an infinite
rewrite loop, and (hopefully) trigger an error.

Yeah, in fact it's easier because PHP as running under the same 
permissions that created the file in the first place. Can you see the 
file? What permissions and owner does it have?

It sounds like it isn't being read, which would be a host problem.

Mathias,

View the source of these two feeds:

   http://tinkernet.org/feed/atom/

   http://tinkernet.org/mathibus-atom.php

You'll see the first one uses 'link rel' code for any post with an 
enclosure like so:

   <link rel='enclosure'
    type='video/quicktime'
    title='Video'
    href='http://example.com/video.mov'
    length='2316226' />

I accomplished this through some semi-ugly hacking that is nothing to be 
proud of. I mean, it works, but I'd really like to see someone who knows 
PHP and WordPress better than me do it right, and add it into the 
wp-atom code. Care to take on that task? ;)

(I'll be glad to provide the code I have, as long as you promise to 
re-write it and make it respectable!)

Pete

I do, my hosting provider use suexec but i can have .htaccess in
directories and have it rewrited by WP. Suexec doens't means you can't
have .htaccess usually it's used to grant privileges enough to script
to work without needing to change the dir permission through CHMOD.

The problems are often related to scripts that check a dir to see if
it's writable or set special chmod that with suexec get error even if
write is possibile or chmod is ignore cause unecessary.

My apologies for not following this up last night.
WP was asking the apache server "Are you apache ?"
Bliksem has that apache server set up to say "No."
So WP thought it was on IIS.
Bliksem. Lacking.

Kudos to Matt for digging around, establishing the problem and then 
fixing the WP code to work around the problem.

Ohh really strange... i don't think that hackers will be stopped by a
server that say it's not me :) Really a strnage situation.

Good to know you solved the problem, then i was right saying that
suexec was not related to .htaccess...

Nice to know that there is setup for webserver that act strange like
this one... every day we learn new stuff... and in IT world looks like
that they never ending but increase more and more every day :)

Hi guys!
I need to left join the post2cat in my posts_join filter. But I get a 
collision so it seems I'm not the only one. Presently I work around this 
problem using strstr() to check for $wpdb->post2cat in the filter 
parameter. If there's a match I assume there is already a join clause 
equivalent to what I need and attemt to reference that one. But this is 
a less than waterproof hack.
So, what is the proper way of doing posts_join filters?

Message-ID: <20050912210354.87346.qmail@web31804.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I've been looking high and low for a way to disable
feeds (for security) without changing any "core"
files. I'm using the registered_only plugin
(http://carthik.net/blog/vault/2005/05/12/registered-only-plugin-reworked/)
and trying to plug the last hole - disabling feeds.

I was looking into plugins, and I think I have
something here that would work. Here's the content of
it:

-----

$disablemessage = '';

function disableFeeds($content) {
    global $disablemessage;
    if(is_feed()) {
        return $disablemessage;
    } else {
        return $content;
    }
}
add_filter('the_content', 'disableFeeds');

----

I haven't tested at all, but that's just to give you
an idea of what it would do and what I've been looking
at doing.

HOWEVER, I just realized - you can set the number of
items to show in your feeds via Options -> Reading.
So, I set that option to 0, and now the feeds all seem
to be empty. 

The question is: does setting this option to 0
effectively "disable" all of your feeds?

Obviously, I'd love a way to "protect" instead of
"disable" these feeds, but disabling them is good
enough for now. Most people don't even know what RSS
is anyway...

There's another simple way to "disable" feeds. Do checks on the uri
that's being requested, if its a feed URI, die out with your message.
If you want to authenticate, do the same thing but replace the die
with code to auth.

There appears to be an "is_feed" function, but I don't
know if you can use it in plugins. I'm guessing you
can, though...

http://boren.nu/archives/2004/10/16/templates-and-the-is-functions/

So, I'm thinking that setting 0 for the Options ->
Reading -> Syndication Feeds should "disable" your
feeds. Authenticating is another issue that I think
would have to be tackled with a plugin, as you
suggested.

function disable_feed() {

Authentication probably isn't worth the trouble.

Hi -

I understand the problem as I experience it myself, but as a moron (I
don't know what I'm doing on this group), I fail to understand the
solution. I have this problem as Podz mentioned since a long time even
before 1.5.2.

I've tried to update the .htaccess automatically as WP says. If I set
666 permissions to  .htaccess file, I get success in Wordpress (as
Podz mentioned), but the file itself isn't updated. If I set it back
to 644 as it normally is when any file is uploaded, I don't see the
update button (I see if you had permissions to write, you could
update..).

What I normally do is that I have .htaccess set to 644 and everytime I
create a new page, I manually re-copy the permalink code, update the
.htaccess file offline and upload it back to the server. This is like
taking your right hand all around the back of your head and eating it
from the left side :)

Matt / WP gurus, plain english please :)

I believe that the fundamental problem that Podz was encountering was 
that, since his host's webserver was incorrectly identifying itself as 
IIS (when, in fact, it's Apache), WP was taking the actions appropriate 
for IIS hosts which do _nothing_ in an Apache environment.  Thus, WP 
either needs to be coaxed into thinking that it's on Apache (correct) 
instead of IIS (incorrect) or Podz's host needs to get its act together 
and correct the server identification string.

That about sum it up?

Forgive me for top-posting, but it would be a better fix to make the feed 
files also behave like, say the blog main page does - there is no reason for 
them not to, since they deliver content too. Adding some of the hooks that 
exist in the header for a normal page would be all that is needed for this 
(like 'init').

I'm sorry, but I don't quite get what you're saying
here.

The reason I am looking into this is actually because
of your plugin, where you recommend that the feeds be
disabled if you are requiring users to be logged in to
see the site. That's because the feeds aren't
protected in that same way via your plugin. So, I'm
basically, in this case, looking for the quickest way
to secure the site - including the feeds. It would
appear that setting the number of items to publish in
a feed to 0 solves the problem, although having
something that "protect" feeds like you can with the
site in general would be cool. I think this is a
problem that a lot of people are seeing with RSS, etc,
and perhaps isn't really something worth tackling at
this point.

Are you saying that there is a better way to disable
and/or protect the feeds, in order to better serve
sites that require a higher level of security?

Message-ID: <s327ee8c.080@groupwise.swin.edu.au>

Hi all,


Anyone have any suggestions for running WP on a host with PHP open_basedir restrictions such that files in a parent folder cannot be included with require_once or include?

I want to avoid hacking WP too much so I don't have to do a major recode each time a new version is released.

The installer doesn't even work because it includes wp-config.php from the parent directory.

I'm thinking I might try and move the wp-admin folder contents into the parent folder (the WP "root"), at least for the install, then see what happens...

Saying that files in parent folders can't be included is incorrect.
The files that can beincluded are only restricted by the folder set in
your configuration, any file or subfolder of that can be included
fine. In the past, WP has worked for me no problems, so perhaps you
should check the configuration options on which directories are
allowed to be opened.

I wondered if having your entire blog exported as RSS

in having your entire blog indexed by the new Google
Blogsearch...? I seem to remember seeing this

I have been using Wordpress as a CMS for a couple of
projects lately, and I would like to share some
feedback with the developers. This is in an effort to
see if there are better/different ways to do the
things I've been doing, and also in the hopes that the
problems I've run into might be brought to attention
for future development. I plan on making this into a
Codex entry, or adding my insights into an existing
entry that could be helpful for people trying to do
something like this.

Basically, I've been using the new Pages feature (is
that considered new anymore?) rather extensively. I'm
using the Posts as a means of keeping the sites fresh,
and they have been mainly little items that the users
are sharing with each other. I?ve also had to restrict
access to the site (it?s being used for bank
documentation) by using some (awesome) plugins.

In order to set up a Wordpress install as a CMS with
access control, I?ve installed the following plugins:

Cookie Timeout (http://www.freemoby.com/)
This shouldn?t be necessary with the new login
checkbox in 1.6

Fold Page List (http://webspaceworks.com/)
This is a great plugin, and I would LOVE to see the
?folding? feature added to wp_list_pages. Once you get
into using a lot of pages on a site, requests to do
this ?folding? come pretty quickly.

Force SSL
(http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Over_SSL)
This is a little plugin I made and posted on the Codex
that forces an SSL connection. If you have an SSL
certificate, then this ensures it is being used on the
front-end, and on the admin side. The plugins_loaded
hook is super-sweet. In order to do this properly,
I?ve changed the Wordpress and Site URIs to ?https?.
However, this change does not appear to be reflected
when uploading images, which means that the image link
generated after the upload is complete needs to have
the ?s? added to the ?http? in the link. If you have
non-https images in an https page, IE throws up these
lame error messages.

Include Page (http://beetle.cbtlsl.com)
This is something I use almost every time I make a
Wordpress site. It allows you to include the contents
of a certain page on the front page (or any page, for
that matter). This lets the user edit the contents via
the admin interface like any other page (as opposed to
getting into the theme editor). Although this isn?t
the place to do it, I?d like to suggest that this sort
of thing be made easier. What I envision would be a
new kind of ?post? type, called a ?piece? or something
like that. These chunks of content would be help aside
from regular Posts/Pages, and could be included
anywhere in a template with some user-friendly tag.
This would be nice for ?about? text chunks, home page
content, etc. It would also be used for keeping
?notes?, like Chris J Davis? CJD Notes plugin. Anyway,
I know this isn?t the spot for such a big item, but I
think it?s worth mentioning.

Last Modified (http://mtdewvirus.com/)
With Pages, I believe that the last modification date
is much more commonly used than a creation date. This
might be a nice function to add to the core.

Registered Only (http://blog.carthik.net/)
This is the starting point for restrict access to your
site. Basically, it checks to see if your logged in,
and then redirects you to the login page if you
aren?t. Along with installing this plugin, I have
disabled the ability for users to register themselves.
Quick feature request, the text on top of the Add User
section should clarify whether or not you have
self-registration enabled. Right now, it always says
that users can register themselves, which is throwing
people off. Also, having a link to the relevant option
would be nice. I have also set the number of feed
items to be syndicated to 0, which seems to ?disable?
the feeds, and increases security. Additionally, I?ve
made some changes to the wp-login page. I?ll get back
to this separately, because I think this is worth
addressing on its own.

Search Pages
(http://randomfrequency.net/wordpress/search-pages/)
This plugin adds Pages to the search. This is
important when you?re mainly using Pages, instead of
Posts.

Wordpress Database Backup (http://www.skippy.net/)
What can I say? Sweet plugin.

x-Dashboard (http://wp-plugins.net/index.php?id=225)
Users at the bank using Wordpress as a CMS just don?t
need to see the standard Dashboard content and feeds.
I would love to see some way to customize the
Dashboard built into the core, but this serves the
purpose for now.

That?s it for plugins. I ALMOST made it without
modifying any core files, due to the plugin and theme
systems being so amazingly amazing. However, there was
core file I can?t see how to get around modyifying
directly ? wp-login.php.

The wp-login page probably wasn?t added to the theme
system for security reasons, I?m guessing. Anyway,
there are two things that I needed to modify, and I
would like to see a way to change these things via an
option in the admin menu, or a plugin. The first thing
is the redirection. Now, when a user logs in, they are
redirected to the wp-admin interface. This makes sense
generally, but not when you are requiring users to be
logged in via the Wordpress users system in order to
access the site.

So, the first option I would like to see is a choice
of where to redirect on login, between wp-admin, and
your blog home page. Secondly, and this is more clear,
I would like to see a way to change the logo from the
Wordpress logo to something else. Ah, and another one
was removing the ?back to blog? link. All of this
makes sense when you consider that the wp-login page
is the first thing a user sees, and (in this case) the
?back to blog? link just redirects you back to the
login page (also, I?m trying to push Wordpress as more
of a CMS than a blog).

The easiest (?) solution here would be to add wp-login
to the theme system, but if that isn?t possible,
allowing some configurability would avoid the need to
modify core files, which, I believe, is a worthy aim.
I would love to see the Registered Only plugin added
as a core feature, and I believe that (in conjunction
with these improvements to the wp-login page) we would
see a real increase in the number of people using
Wordpress as a CMS for sites that require user
authentication.

Finally (and this is a smaller issue), I?m confused
with the Add New User area on the users.php page. Why
is the first field ?nickname? rather than ?username?,
and how does the username get generated (if nickname
and username aren?t the same thing).

I apologize for the REALLY long message here. I think
that a lot of the issues I?m dealing with here seem
small, but they do add up. And I might be a little
ahead of the game in trying to use Wordpress as a CMS
with authentication, but you?d be amazed at the
positive responses I have been getting. I can?t wait
to drop in the 1.6 upgrade and suddenly have WYSIYWG
included by default!

I don?t know if I should try to report these issues as
feature requests or something else, but I?m hoping to
spark a discussion of the ways in which Wordpress can
be used as a rather full-featured CMS, and to make
using it as such even easier and more natural than it
is already.

Thanks so much to the developers and hackers in the
Wordpress community.

Could you try out this patch and let me know if it helps things?

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2876

It should allow the redirects to be more flexible.

The essence of what I said was that the feeds should also have some of the 
hooks that the other "templates" have in the header, for example. However 
for the registered_only plugin to work _ideally_, with the same hooks, 
someone should be able to use something like LJ's HTTP digest auth system 
for feeds.

The reason I am looking into this is actually because

Setting "0" solves the problem, but creates a new one - even registered 
users wont be able to read anything in the feeds :)

Are you saying that there is a better way to disable

I am saying there should be some thought put into this.

Thanks so much for the quick response! I think it's
very important to avoid hacking up core files - makes
upgrading much easier.

I put together a plugin that takes advantage of this
new code. I'm no PHP expert, and I would appreciate
any help in making it better. Basically, it uses the
"init" hook and checks if you're logged in already and
if the "redirect_to" variable has already been set -
if all is clear, it will set "redirect_to" to your
blog's home page.

I think I can use the "wp_header" hook to add CSS that
would allow me to change the image, and other visual
aspects of the wp-login page. I'll try and do that via
a plugin as well.

Here's the plugin, and thanks for the help!

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Redirect to Blog
Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org
Description:  Redirects to your Blog's home page
instead of the admin interface on initial login, which
is good if you're forcing users to log in before they
can see your site.
Version: 1.0
Author: Mr. Wordpress
Author URI: http://wordpress.org
*/

function redirect_to_blog() {
	
	global $userdata;
	get_currentuserinfo();
	
    if( ( !isset($_REQUEST['redirect_to']) ) && (
!isset($userdata->user_login) ) ) {
		$_REQUEST['redirect_to'] = get_bloginfo('url');
		}
    }

add_action('init', 'redirect_to_blog');

Subject: [wp-hackers] Hello, question on $_GET values with plugins
Message-ID: <4329873D.7010202@ryanmwilliams.com>

Hi all, I just joined the list because I've been working on some 
WordPress plugins.  It's been going well but I've run into a small issue 
I could use help with.

My plugin has an administrative interface under Manage which displays 
data from its table.  It is essentially the same sort of interface as 
the Manage Posts page.  Like that page I want to have hyperlinks 'Edit' 
and 'Delete'.  So the url would include something like '?gbedit=1' where 
the number is the id number of the entry I want to edit.  If I just do 
that though I end up with an url: WPURL/edit.php?gbedit=1  Adding the 
plugin filename ends up with WPURL/wp-admin/plugin.php?gbedit=1  None of 
those work of course.

It seems like this should be simple enough but I'm having trouble 
finding out the answer.  $_POST values are easy but I'm just not sure 
what to do to pass the variable on the URL so that my plugin will get 
that value.

Any help will be appreciated.

thanks,
Ryan

You might want to try something like edit.php?page=<?php echo 
basename(__FILE__); 
?>&therestofyouroptions=whatever&moreoptions=whateverelse
 The URL worked for me ina form POST but I didn't have to pass the GET 
parameters to it, but can't think of a reason they wouldn't work.

$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . '&edit=1'; should work on plugin admin pages

Indeed, I should have pointed out that the reason one may want to use 
add_query_arg instead of just string concatentation is that if the GET 
var is already in the url it'll be replaced, rather than one ending up 
with &edit=1&edit=1.

I can handle someone not saying "thanks" when they've been helped, but 
this kid is outright abusive.  He consistently demands help, and if it 
doesn't work the first time -- with zero effort on his part -- he slings 
insults.

Having an op in the channel would really help.

In the short term, I'd guess this kid would do whatever he could to 
circumvent the block to cause trouble.  An op or two in the channel 
could work to keep him out, regardless of which host or nick he uses.

This is also a strong reminder for everyone to register their nick with 
freenode, and to identify themselves when logging in.  It's just a 
matter of time before someone like mindamp appropriates the nick of a 
regular and starts talking trash in the channel.

As a target of one of his tirades, I agree.  Some control has to be 
maintained over the IRC channel.  People who are trying to help can't be 
bothered to deal with this abusive noise.

An example conversation:
http://asymptomatic.net/wp/2005/09/14/1975/support-in-flames/

I just now watched a "conversation" go by with carthik that was short 
but irritatingly similar.

Why not just use one or both of these (works with ircII and I would think
most other clients have an equivalent):

    /ignore mindamp!*@* all
    /ignore *!*@host-208-60-212-190.vista-express.com all

If you only want to ignore his messages on the channel, use the message
type of "public" instead of "all".

This way you don't have to see the messages, and if enough people ignore
him, he should start growing tired.

Many people seeking immediate assistance in #wordpress are not familiar
with IRC commands, and will not know how to do this on a regular basis.
 Plus, people asking for help shouldn't have to see mindamp's drivel to
begin with, as it might seriously turn them away from IRC support; which
would be a real shame, because the channel has been a high-quality
resource for a lot of people.

Okay, who would like to have temp ops to moderate the channel until this 
passes over?

skippy is an obvious choice, who else is there all the time and knows 
IRC commands?

I know I'm active a lot and know IRC commands. There are also a few
other obvious choices besides skippy, like Podz (who, although he may
not be familiar now, I'm sure could quickly learn from the ones of us
that are familiar in the channel.)

I might be able to help you guys with this. mindamp!n=
Oxford@host-208-60-212-190.vista-express.com - from that he's a Vista3Media 
customer. Now, it so happens I work for the tech support company who 
provides tech support to Vista3Media. Has he done anything besides verbally 
harass you? Btw, you can also block all of Vista (well, those IPs with 
proper reverse DNS anyways): *!*@*.vista-express.com <http://express.com>

Let me know if I can do anything to help.

Firas and Masquerade are two other choices. One or the other is pretty
much always around. Maybe there are other options, like a kick-bot
whom only a few regulars will know how to trigger? I know AI is never
a good substitute for people, but it may be worth a look.

Hi,

I just had to move a page below another page, which changed the
permalink, and realized there is no ErrorDocument
handling in the .htaccess.
I added it manually to classes.php but would it not make sense to add it
in some way by default?

WordPress handles 404 responses internally, assuming your theme has a
404.php file.

Other ErrorDocument directives could probably be added by a plugin
that hooks into the mod_rewrite_rules filter, so you wouldn't need to
edit core files.  I've attached an example.

The reason it did not was my peramlink structure.
If you set your permalink structure to anything different but
"/%postname%/", for example
to "/%year%/%postname%/", error handling does not work anymore.

Looks like a bug?

Create two new categories at root level.  In each of those, create a 
category named "FOO".  Attempt to access the post listing for 
"category2/FOO" and you actually get "category1/FOO".

There are two options for fixing as I see it.   Either the category 
adding code should enforce the creation of unique category slugs OR the 
the rewriter should select a category based on the entire category 
string specified and not just the last subcat in the string.  I prefer 
the latter option, but it requires more complicated changes.

Thoughts?

Message-ID: <20050919135614.79624.qmail@web31808.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

After reading this:

http://boren.nu/archives/2005/08/30/commit-this/

In particular, this part: "Themes can now provide
their own plugin. If a functions.php file resides in
the active theme?s template directory, that file is
loaded after plugins are loaded. This allows themes to
provide their own custom functions and create their
own options page in the admin UI. Envelope pushing
themes such as K2 will benefit from this."

I'm wondering if any thought has been given to
potential conflicts between plugins and then plugins a
theme might provide in the optional functions.php
file. 

My thinking is that one might want to override a
function provided by a theme with a plugin, so
functions loaded via plugins should take precedence
over functions loaded via themes. 

However, I can see why one might go the other way with
it. 

Just Curious,

There is no straightforward way in PHP to choose which function gets
declared other than to declare them in order, which is why the plugin
files load first, they can override anything in
pluggable-functions.php or potentially in theme function files if the
theme functions are properly checked (if(function_exists(...)))

We need to do the same for pages.

Surely its just the same as conflicts between plugins? Just namespace
all your functions, and everyone's happy;

It's really irrelevant. A conflict of function names would produce a
PHP Fatal error anyway.

I don't think it's necessarily that simple.

Suppose for example that a theme adds a content filter for acronyms.  If 
a plugin is installed with the same feature, and they are namespaced 
differently, then the Acronym filter could be applied twice.

That's a simple example of interference that could be more significant 
in a more significant plugin.  If the acronym functionality is just part 
of the full featureset of the plugin, then turning off the plugin might 
not be a practical response to its feature collision with a theme's 
functions.php.

Perhaps it would be wise to allow an administrator to disable a theme's 
functions.php file entirely from the Presentation tab of the WP admin?

Or, at the least, a theme that wants to provide additional functionality 
via the functions.php should provide a way to disable part or all of the 
functionality that it provides.

Note also that themes that are packed with functions from original 
plugins might have the need to be overridden by the dedicated plugins 
should security or bug-fix issues occur.  In that case, the theme author 
should have allowed for an administrator to supplant the functions.php 
functionality with that of the original plugin.

Arr.

This is actually what I was thinking about originally.
If, for example, you included that talk-like-a-pirate
plugin/filter with that one pirate theme "Yar, tis me
blog" or whatever, and then there was an update to the
plugin from the original author - would you be able to
install the plugin on your own (via the plugins
interface, as opposed to the themes interface) and
overwrite the one included by the theme? 

As for conflicts between functions is PHP, I'm still
getting my sea-legs, so I can't really speak to that! :)

Once again, that's the same as overlapping behaviour between plugins.
Two different plugins providing a wide but overlapping feature set
would cause this problem.

In my opinion, the fault here is with the plugins. Good plugin design
is modular: individual pieces of functionality are seperated out into
different plugins, or at least there's an option panel to enable or
disable pieces of functionality.

Of course, my modularity pipe dream may not be reality: not all
plugins are built in this way. However I don't think there's going to
be an elegant solution here: allowing turning off of a theme's
functions.php file is likely to cause numerous problems if the theme
depends on it. Example: a theme's sidebar.php file calls a function
which is defined in a theme's functions.php. Turn it off, and we get a
Fatal Error. We may be able to subvert this somewhat by just ignoring
all add_action and add_filter calls within the functions.php file
(i.e., still include it but don't let it do anything other than define
functions), but this is still going to cause problems in certain
situations. Like I said, no elegant solution.

We can't enforce that, but that would be the ideal solution.

This is most definitely a pipe-dream, but I thought
I'd think out loud, just for a sec. Would it be
possible to have an admin submenu item appear if a
plugin included a "functions.php" file, which would
list the functions, and allow you to check-to-disable
them? I know that would be a lot of work, if at all
possible, but I'm thinking you might be able to do
this using the wp_options table, like the k2 theme
does.

Like I said, total pipe-dream, but worth mentioning, I hope.

It doesn't even need that, the theme functions file is loaded right
after plugin time, we should be able to use the standard admin hooks.

Yes. Especially considering the new add_theme_page() function!

In WordPress, as in other pluginophilic packages, it is up to the
plugin authors to handle plugin-to-plugin incompatibilities. They can
use coordination, documentation, option panels or conditional function
declarations.

In the interest of keeping the core light and fast, the options in the
stock user interface minimal  and plugin authors responsible, I would
let this very convenient new include stand like it is.

OK. I just wanted to go over it because I thought it
might be a support issue in the future. But this
sounds right to me. Thanks for clarifying - I think it
was worth going over, at least it was to me!

I'm not seeing this ability documented anywhere
(http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development ?) so
I'll ask the doc people if it exists somewhere or
write it up.

Well, at this point I think we are supposed to hold off on documenting
1.6 features, and I've been meaning to pull up a thread on the Docs
list on if we should copy to Page_1.6 and start documentation, since a
lot of APIs are changing. If someone else wants to start it, It would
be apprecitaed.

+1. It would take a lot of inelegant code to get anywhere near a
satisfactory solution. A complete solution may not be possible at all.

I'm still not 100% sure of the reason behind allowing a theme to
define it's own functions.  Surely, if a theme *requires* plugins to
work they should be detailed in the readme, along with installation
instructions (not that they're needed with WP), and included in the
download package for the theme.

Yes the new include is convenient, but convenience shouldn't be
implimented for the sake of it.  The difference between editing
/wp-content/themes/Theme01/functions.php and
/wp-content/plugins/pluginName.php is a small one IMHO.

Just to add my tuppence to the mix.

It ties functionality to a theme, which is bad. If someone has an idea 
for additional functionality that they want to release as a part of 
their theme, great, but it should be a plugin, so I can use it with 
other themes if I so choose.

I think the idea is that themes which make use of a
lot of plugins, like k2, benefit from this because it
makes it much easier to get things up and running the
way the theme designer intended.

Now, I understand the point that convenience features
shouldn't always be included, but I think that the
goal of making themes more flexible, powerful, and
easier to install is a worthy one.

It sounds like this would be better served by a new container (for
lack of a better term) that contains both a theme and plugins, now of
course you can do that manually now but wouldn't such a container fit
better in the WP framework than mixing plugins/functions in with
themes?

If it makes it conceptually easier for people, why not have a 
[theme]/plugins/ optional subfolder?  If there are files there, treat them 
as 'second pass' plugins during the plugin-load process.  I think that's the 
proper 'container' direction (aside from moving to an actual container, i.e. 
zipped format of some sort...).  And it makes more sense than some file 
named 'functions.php' in the theme folder (there's already a ton of php 
files).  People would understand a folder named 'plugins', I'd think!

Hi,
I started using wordpress recently, and I made some changes to the  
theme engine on my copy of the code.  I also have some ideas to make  
the themeing more flexible.  I was wondering how I should go about  
trying to submit changes to the code, and also the coding format for  
this project.
The changes I made deal with the way the category list is displayed,  
I made an option to display the list as just a list of links, so they  
can be horizontal. I know you can do that with css, but, I needed a  
way to display them as a plain series of links.  Is this possible to  
do with the existing code, because I do not want to have my own  
forked version to maintain.

thanks

There's a coding style guide available at
http://wordpress.org/docs/developer/coding-style/ Discussion of
forward development can be discussed on this list.

BTW, the description that you provided for your category list code
seems to make it more suitable for release as a plugin rather than a
core change.

Methinks this discussion has become a kind of new-feature-bash. Has
anyone here used a theme with a functions.php or tried writing one?
I'll share my experiences for the benefit of those who have none.

I'm working on an improvement for the default theme, Kubrick. It takes
advantage of the new add_theme_page function to give me this options
page:
http://www.andyskelton.com/picture_library/kubrick_options.png

This functionality is created in functions.php, but it could also have
been done with a plugin. Let's weigh the two options here:
functions.php:
* automatically activated and deactivated when the theme is changed
* saves conditional statements because the theme author KNOWS it's activated
* the user doesn't have to think about matching plugins to themes
* the user doesn't even need access to the Plugins page (N.B. MU users)

File in plugin dir:
* must be activated and deactivated when the theme is changed
* vestigial admin panels appear when users forget to deactivate the
theme's plugin
* theme must call all functions conditionally because the plugin might
be off or missing
* Aunt Bessie is confused because she has to copy more files and
activate some thingy
* plugins are not always accessible (e.g. wordpress.com users) so the
theme would not be very portable
* theme author must include special instructions for installation and switching
* is this supposed to make life easier for somebody?

You can tell I'm in favor of functions.php support. Why anyone would
try to stop it is a huge mystery to me.

David, functions.php is not a plugin. It is a file that contains
functions that the theme author can use in the theme and/or in admin
panels. It helps one separate logic and presentation. It is not meant
to supplant use of plugins such as Gravatars, support for which can be
included safely in any theme by using conditional function calls.

I agree that it is a good feature, and I was only
bringing it up because I wanted to make sure it was
thought about and discussed. That's what's been
happening, and I think that is healthy and productive.
I don't think anybody has been bashing it, but rather
trying to weight the pros and cons, which you have
certainly done a great job with.

Something I was thinking about, on a related note,
would be to consider making a "standardized" or
at-least 'recommended" way to show an options page for
the current theme. This work with the Kubrick theme
and the new k2 theme's options page are already
showing up with different titles, etc.

I wonder if just agreeing to standardize the name and
location of the current theme's options page (if there
is one) would be worthwhile. I'm thinking that calling
the page "Current Theme Options" or something would be
enough. That way, users would kind of know where to
look for that sort of thing, rather than it being done
on a case-by-case basis.

Your best bet is to submit a bug report to trac:
http://trac.wordpress.org. (It's our catch-all system for bug reports,
feature requests and so on).

In terms of coding style, I can recommend the Codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org. Documentation on wordpress.org tends to be
old and somewhat stale. The codex has full(-ish) developer docs.

I've think you've nailed it there. functions.php allows authors to
seperate their logic from the actual templates. Think of it as the
equivalent to a 'helper' file in MVC format (if you've used Rails
before, this will be familiar, but if not, the helper files are
essentially a load of functions which supplement the display logic).

As Andy said, we have add_theme_page(). This adds an options page in a
standardised place. While we don't standardise the name of this page
(plugin authors can specify this), I don't think this would be too big
a problem.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Missing Hooks for Widget Filters
Message-ID: <433060FB.6070405@wood.name>

Hello all,

I'm new to WP, so I hope this is going through the proper procedures. 
I'm trying to add a psuedo permissions plugin where I can restrict 
certain posts from being viewed by certain users based on category (for 
which I've added a table). This was very, very easy to implement with 
the main loop by creating a 'posts_join' and 'posts_where'. 
Unfortunately it's not so easy to filter out results of various other 
'widgets' on the blog.

I see that a 'list_cats_exclusions' filter was added to list_cats() with 
1.5.2(?), allowing me to filter out the categories. I've patched my 
1.5.1.3 install and this works beautifully.

Unfortunately I don't see any methods to filter out get_archives() or 
get_calendar(), two widgets that would otherwise display post titles and 
provide links to 'hidden' posts. I don't see any mechanism to plug into, 
so I would propose adding 4 filters to template-functions-general.php: 
archives_join, archives_where, calendar_join, calendar_where.

I've also taken a look at get_next_post() and get_previous_post() in 
template-functions-links.php and I see a place to hook into for 
excluding categories. Unfortunately, as currently implemented, this 
functionality doesn't appear to work. Specifically, this is trying to 
exclude based on post_category in the posts table, which doesn't appear 
to be set (I'm guessing that when the posts2cat table was added, this 
field was deprecated).

To 'fix' get_next_post() and get_previous_post() (and add the filtering 
I need for my plugin), I propose moving the INNER JOIN out of the 
$in_same_cat block and changing the exclusions to exclude the field 
"category_id" instead of "post_category". Then after the loop that 
generates $sql_exclude_cats, add a filter for "next_previous_exclusions".

I've attached a patch for both of the files. Please let me know if you 
think these changes are possible.

Gregory

I have to say, I must agree with Andy. Let's not think of this as a
theme's plugin file, let's think of it as functions that can be
defined outside of the normal scope of a theme. Sure, other themes
could just include their functions at the top, but what happens when
you want to add an admin page? This is almost entirely the reason this
hook was added after months of discussion on other threads, and I
would hate to see it go because some people think that this is
something it isn't.

> I'm still not 100% sure of the reason behind allowing a theme to

Themes could have declared their own functions before, nothing was
stopping them, now we add the functions a few steps earlier, before
the admin code, so that admin pages can be loaded. Why is everyone
freaking out?

I only skimmed your email, but if this is a bug report or feature
request, then submit it to http://trac.wordpress.org.

Call me crazy, but there is one feature of the former behavior that I 
like... you can MOVE a category without its permalinks breaking.  And if 
you're using Scott Yang's permalink redirect plugin, it'll give a 
redirect to the new location!  I moved my WordPress category from 
/category/internet/wordpress/ to /category/wordpress/ and the old links 
still work.

Still, that probably doesn't outweigh the benefit of being able to have 
/category/sports/people/ and /category/movies/people/ or something.  
Ugh, that's going to be a bear to write... although at least we don't 
have to do mod_rewrite rules as well. :-)

I wasn't freaking out, I just didn't understand the reasoning behind
it.  Now that a couple of people have explained why it's a good idea I
can see that my comments weren't really valid.

I can second this.  Same errors, but the blog actually gets created and 
the password e-mailed.  At logon, this error is returned though:

You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page.

What's that all about?  We don't require unique user IDs for login now?

Is this a bleed-over from MU?  And if so, what's the plan here?  Is 
WordPress becoming MU?  I thought MU was a fork.

It's needs to be enforced on the code level, not with database errors. 
The new user database is designed to be something modular you can plug 
into almost any application, bbPress and MU are just two other apps 
using it. It may continue to evolve before 1.6 goes "gold."

Can't the code logic apply checks prior to registration, while leaving
the unique key in the schema so that the database will prevent any
mistakes that might slip past the code?

That would screw the modularity that Matt indicated. Other programs
might want to allow multiple users with the same login.

It already was without generating database errors.  Why change the 
database structure to allow for something that the code does not? 
Especially when the database constraint simply reinforces what the code 
already does?

In a similar vein, everything in registration-functions.php might need 
to be pluggable.

Just out of curiousity, is 1.6 actually going to be version 1.6 or is
it going to be 2.0?

1.0
1.2
1.5

Evidence for a 1.6 is pretty small :)

I'm calling it 1.6 until told otherwise.

I stopped trying to predict the future of a product's development
not long after BeOS went belly up.

And considering that 1.5 was actually called 1.3 for a while. It was 
later decided that it would be 1.5 instead.

Personally, I think that the user system overhaul alone justifies a full 
version number bump.

Figure in the snazzy AJAXification of a large set of the admin sections, 
and I can't see how this wouldn't be called 2.0

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress.com Support, WordPress MU support
Message-ID: <4331F645.5010609@skippy.net>

In the #wordpress-meetup this evening we discussed support options for 
WordPress.com and WordPress MU.  Specifically the question was: should 
we at wordpress.org/support/ provide support for the .com and MU variants?

It was suggested that WordPress.com be assigned its own support forum, 
inside the wordpress.com domain.  A link to this support forum can be 
provided from the WordPress menu bar, and the wordpress.com users could 
form a community of their own, supporting one another, without causing 
undue frustration in the current WordPress support forums.

The basic idea was this:
wordpress.org/support == support for WordPress, the application
mu.wordpress.org/support == support for WordPress MU, the application
wordpress.com/support == support for wordpress.com, the hosted service

This post from Ryan:
    http://wordpress.org/support/topic/45118#post-251167
suggests that he's thinking similarly to us, at least so far as we glean 
from that post.

So, please consider this a formal request to change the links inside 
*.wordpress.com/wp-admin/ to a wordpress.com support resource.  I think 
it's acceptable for links to the codex to remain pointing to the codex 
-- user documentation should be the same between WordPress, WordPress 
MU, and wordpress.com.

Cheers,
Scott

Nope. +.2 +.3 +.5 (prime numbers) = Version 2.0 :)

Hmm...
1.0 * 6/5 = 1.2
1.2 * 5/4 = 1.5
1.5 * 4/3 = 2.0
Teehee!
However, it's not sustainable:
2.0 * 3/2 = 3.0
3.0 * 2/1 = 6.0
6.0 * 1/0 = ERR
So you see, it can't be 2.0. :-)

If this absolutely _must_ stay (personally, I'd prefer it reverted)
then we need to seriously rethink certain areas and the problems that
this checkin causes:

1.) Only the first person with a login name can log in with that name,
the other person is SOL, even if they have the right password (WFM on
two machines, if someone else could test this)
2.) Password conflicts between two login names. How do we tell them
apart in the off chance that they a) select the same password b) have
colliding md5s
3.) Don't let there be a second admin user on a default WP install,
its just illogical
4.) The Users interface needs some fixes to account for this change also
5.) The upgrade script doesn't make this change to the database, the
table needs to be dropped and recreated unless the upgrade scripts are
fixed to work around it.

Yes, but then you'd have to switch all the password code from MD5 to Blowfish.

When you develop a plugin, dear developers, please PLEASE test it during 
XMLRPC as well. I have had several support requests from my ecto users 
about failed postings due to installed plugins. Please test if your 
plugin works when a new post is made or edited via XMLRPC. WordPress 
will also call your plugin during XMLRPC and some functions may not be 
available then. Here's a recent example from a user:

Subject: [wp-hackers] HTML Anchor Syntax
Message-ID: <1959130b05092622154d1d02ed@mail.gmail.com>

In a recent changeset (2906) [1], there are anchors that are being
created on the admin post page. The HTML uses the following syntax:

<a id="preview-post"></a>

I am wondering why this specific syntax is being used instead of
simply adding the same id to the h2 element itself, like so:

<h2 id="preview-post"><?php _e('Post Preview (updated when post is
saved)'); ?> ...

As far as I know, using the A element for anchoring is a thing of the
past, and even then it was <a name="..."> (an empty element without
the closing </a>).

Clarification on this usage would be appreciated and I think it would
be good to establish a product-wide standard for anchor syntax (if one
doesn't already exist).

Thanks.

This sounds like a good option. Have a "wizard" of sorts, and an option to
switch to advanced mode to have more control over importing.

If you wish to work with the latest release, it's best to check out
the latest code from the SVN repository:

Let me highlight the second paragraph:

"You can track changes on the web or through our SVN mailing list but 
many people choose to run the nightly builds to help us identify bugs. 
If you would like to be part of this process, please join the WP Testers 
mailing list and the nightly build location will be sent to you."

I don't know if you can help me or not but here goes....
My email in hotmail and yahoo (3 addresses) have been hacked.  I cannot 
access them as the address or password have been changed.  Do you know if 
there is anyway to get into them again and is it possible to find out who 
did this?  ie.  IP address or something
Thanks for any help or could you direct me to someone who would know what to 
do.

I think you misunderstood the purpose of this list, it is not a
hackers list in the media sense. This is a list for developers and
members of the WordPress community to discuss its future. And I highly
doubt anything was truely hacked, you probably just picked a dumb
password. Be smart next time, and use good passwords and don't silly
stuff to lists where it doesn't belong.

also tried to contact Donncha, but I can not get a hold of either.

The problem is describe on the MultiUser WordPress forums at:

Can anyone get a hold of Matt and ask him to respond?

Thank you

No one here other than Matt controls the WordPress.com site.  None of us
have any better access to Matt than you do.  Indeed, it seems you have
considerably BETTER access to Matt than most of us.

I fail to see how this is a pressing issue.  The lack of a link for a
few hours -- or even days -- is hardly going to jeopardize OpenDomain.

Be patient.  Matt has a life beyond WordPress.  Your link will likely be
restored eventually.

Hello,

I've found the following security issue report today:
http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/23 (reported at

Is wordpress affected by this issue? I wanted to ask first, before I
maybe write an unfounded bug report.

This looks like a problem with Geshi, which is apparently a mod for
WordPress that adds some sort of syntax highlighting, and is unrelated
to WordPress itself since Geshi is vunerable on multiple platforms.

GeSHi is a generic syntax hilighter as far as I could tell when this 
came up on the support forums yesterday.

There is at least one plugin that uses it that _may_ be affected:

this is indeed GeSHi's problem & those who use GeSHi as it is are 
affected
by it. My plugin iG:Syntax Hiliter isn't affected by it as the bug is in 
the
'./contrib/example.php' file. This whole directory is not included in 
the plugin
ZIP and doesn't need to be present on a webserver for GeSHi to be
operational. So those who are not simply the types of "upload everything 
in
the ZIP, no matter if you use it or not" won't possibly suffer from this 
bug.

I've however sent this bug to the Nigel(GeSHi developer) who'll look 
further
into it to see whether this bug extends to the GeSHi core.

no, that plugin is also not affected as far as I can say as that also 
doesn't
include the 'contrib' directory in the plugin-package
