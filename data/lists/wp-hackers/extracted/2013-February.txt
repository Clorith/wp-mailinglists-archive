Subject: [wp-hackers] Limiting get_users() results by meta value
Message-ID: <CAMg3evFqgWMmTBo6Ee8EoYaAvCNBB=-7sFmnBYQ5KX-CAzkA6Q@mail.gmail.com>

I want to limit the results returned by get_users() to a subset of the
users based on some criteria that will be stored in the User Meta table
(e.g. all users whose first name begins with M).  I am stuck on how to
handle the wild card with the LIKE comparison.

Here arr the args I am passing to get_users():
(
    [include] =>
    [exclude] =>
    [fields] => all_with_meta
    [meta_key] => last_name
    [meta_value] => M%
    [meta_compare] => LIKE
)

This is the query the WordPress constructs for me:

[01-Feb-2013 16:01:08 UTC] WP_User_Query Object
(
    [query_vars] => Array
        (
            [blog_id] => 1
            [role] =>
            [meta_key] => last_name
            [meta_value] => M%
            [meta_compare] => LIKE
            [include] =>
            [exclude] =>
            [search] =>
            [search_columns] => Array
                (
                )

            [orderby] => login
            [order] => ASC
            [offset] =>
            [number] =>
            [count_total] =>
            [fields] => all_with_meta
            [who] =>
        )

    [results] => Array
        (
        )

    [total_users] => 0
    [query_fields] => wp_users.ID
    [query_from] => FROM wp_users INNER JOIN wp_usermeta ON (wp_users.ID =
wp_usermeta.user_id)
    [query_where] => WHERE 1=1 AND ( (wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'last_name'
AND CAST(wp_usermeta.meta_value AS CHAR) LIKE '%M\\%%') )
    [query_orderby] => ORDER BY user_login ASC
    [query_limit] =>


As you can see, the LIKE clause is escaped and wrapped with SQL wildcard
operators.  I can't figure out how to prevent this from happening as what I
want is "LIKE 'M%'" to be my actually query.  I can't seem to find what I
am searching for when I Google it, can anyone point me to an example of how
to do what I want to do?

Thanks,

Mike

Currently, "LIKE" prepends and appends wildcards, as in %term%. We could
add "%LIKE" and "LIKE%", though that would not help with the situation
where you want LIKE taken literally, potentially without % wildcards at
all. (Such as using _ as a single-character wildcard, or looking for case
insensitive matching.) Probably the best way to add to this API would be to
allow for a 'like_escape' => false; that would accept your value as
provided. If you'd like to submit a ticket (and patch), this can definitely
find its way into 3.6.

Bummer - I was hoping I had simply missed something.

I like the idea of a 'like_escape' => false option and am willing to try
and do a patch.  I took a look through the code and it appears the patch
needs to be applied to meta.php.  I have something up and running, I will
try and generate a patch and open a Trac ticket.  I had to call the new
argument 'meta_like_escape' to get it to work as the 'meta_' prefix is
assumed in WP_Meta_Query.

Message-ID: <F59E252B-0C12-4936-ACA5-9F1CB3754697@nextlevelcode.com>

I'm interested in taking over development of a plugin. It hasn't been updated in over a year and a recent WP update has exposed some bugs in the code. I've attempted to contact the current developer but, so far I haven't received a response. 

I could simply create a new plugin with a slightly different name but I'd prefer to update the current code so that anyone using the plugin would get the updates going forward. 

Is their a way to take over ownership of a plugin without involving the current owner?

Thanks

Email plugins at wordpress.org about it. Include a link to the plugin
(you be surprised at how many people don't include a link).

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP uploader addition question
Message-ID: <CAFnKAk1fOtYbKfb9=nfF-7rbHvC0ydbbnyQZUvHU-aDoqUq+Mw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I have recently been wondering about extending the wordpress uploaders
introduced in 3.5.
I know the 3.5 uploaders are meant for extensibility with Backbone.js, but
I've been having a hard time finding examples.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14192292
The lack of answer would seem to suggest that for custom uploaders with
more options, we must make our own template, or perhaps make a similar
uploader based on the media-views.js and other examples?

http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/76980/add-a-menu-item-to-wordpress-3-5-media-manager
This answer looks like the new right-way to extend the uploader?
Unfortunately, it doesn't show in the other window-style, called by the
featured-image-picker, or the custom code "wp.media({title:'new',
multiple:false}).open()". A similar problem exists in Nextgen now, since
you can't select a NextGen image from the featured-image.

Is there a recommended way to add a nextgen-style picker, or an additional
option to the 'media' category, for both the post-uploader and the
featured-image style uploader?

Best regards,
Luke

Subject: [wp-hackers] finding out the top 5 source ( source is a custom
 taxonomy ), in a given category
Message-ID: <CAHERW=3k50u2LvxnbCGZxHiT4zbqhCjnQmnRWROwRHubtbY5jw@mail.gmail.com>

The client I'm working with have thousands of articles and media (
audio/video ) files. To WordPress, all are posted by Author ID 1,
which we named as STAFF.

All the content though in reality has been created by various people
and sources, certainly not by the STAFF.

To keep that info ( who created the content or where the source is ),
I used a non-hierarchical custom taxonomy called "source". if the
source happens to be an institution name I tagged the content by the
institution name as follows.

Example:

source: CNN source: Washington Post

And if the source happens to be a person, I used a prefix "by " in
front of the name.

Example:

source: by anderson cooper source: by jon stewart

Of course, the content has been tagged and categorized, accordingly.

Now, the question is how to effectively find out things like who's the
top 5 source's in category XYZ?

I don't think this can be pulled by using the wp_query args - by
tapping into the advanced tax query's section, cause wp_query args
eventually returns posts only. Here we are asking terms in return.

One possible way for this is the following

take the XYX category go thru all the posts - one by one particularly
paying attention to the source data in those posts while going thru,
dump each source term id in a temporary table when done with going
thru all the posts in that category, switch your attention to the
temporary table and get a summary on that table using a get count
after a group by and finally get the top 5.

but getting all that in a single statement? that ain't my cup of tea yet.

You might look at how wp_generate_tag_cloud() in
wp-includes/category-template.php goes about finding the term counts and
assigning font sizes based on those counts.

IMHO this is probably a case where using a custom tax is not the
optimal solution *if* you have no need to group posts by source for
primary querying.
If a post meta value was used instead, or even if the post_author
field, it would have greatly simplified your data structure.

See http://ottopress.com/2011/when-to-not-use-a-custom-taxonomy/

With your current structure, you'll need to do a manual SQL if you
want any kind of performance.. join term_relationships and
term_taxonomy against eachother, probably join that against
term_taxonomy again, and  order by the count field..  The other option
is to query for all posts in Category XYZ, loop over them, get the
tags for each post, sum and filter.. but that's a rather expensive
process.

You might be able to find an article online about finding the most
popular TAGS in a category, you can simply change the taxonomy names
and it'd work as expected..  I certainly can't find one right now.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Filter the_content output raw data in some themes
Message-ID: <002701ce0279$0aa13b00$227b0c46@TITA>


Hello,

I'm creating a plugin that auto places info on post type single and post type archive listings, working ok on 2012 theme and some others but not in 2010, 2011.

The filter do works on 2010 and 2011 but outputs raw data (no html tags) in archive listings (single posts are ok), I think has something to do some themes functions on creating excerpts or alike? If so, how I'm supposed to skip the theme filter through the plugin, at least on default WP themes?

Thanks for any help, tried to search for this but can't find anything about it

Hi Drew,

I checked the API. It starts out like this;


607	function wp_generate_tag_cloud( $tags, $args = '' ) {
608	        $defaults = array(
609	                'smallest' => 8, 'largest' => 22, 'unit' => 'pt',
'number' => 0,
610	                'format' => 'flat', 'separator' => "\n", 'orderby'
=> 'name', 'order' => 'ASC',
611	                'topic_count_text_callback' => 'default_topic_count_text',
612	                'topic_count_scale_callback' =>
'default_topic_count_scale', 'filter' => 1,
613	        );

I don't think it's got anything to do with any taxonomy but the post_tag.
In my case, there are 2 taxonomies involved. category and source.

Excellent idea by suggesting and simplifying my problem "that is
getting the popular TAGS in a category".

With that diagnosis, the rest is a little bit of googling and little
bit of customization.

Here it is.

$sql = "SELECT count(*) as count,terms2.name as tag FROM wp_posts as p1
				LEFT JOIN wp_term_relationships as r1 ON p1.ID = r1.object_ID
				LEFT JOIN wp_term_taxonomy as t1 ON r1.term_taxonomy_id =
t1.term_taxonomy_id
				LEFT JOIN wp_terms as terms1 ON t1.term_id = terms1.term_id,

				wp_posts as p2
	
				LEFT JOIN wp_term_relationships as r2 ON p2.ID = r2.object_ID
				LEFT JOIN wp_term_taxonomy as t2 ON r2.term_taxonomy_id =
t2.term_taxonomy_id
				LEFT JOIN wp_terms as terms2 ON t2.term_id = terms2.term_id

				WHERE
			
				t1.taxonomy = 'category' AND p1.post_status = 'publish' AND
terms1.name = 'YOUR CATEGORY NAME HERE' AND
				t2.taxonomy = 'THAT OTHER CUSTOM TAXONOMY HERE - IN MY CASE THAT
IS TO BE SOURCE' AND p2.post_status = 'publish'
	
				AND p1.ID = p2.ID
				
				GROUP BY tag
				
				ORDER BY count DESC limit 5
				";


	global $wpdb;
	$terms = $wpdb->get_results($sql,ARRAY_A);
	foreach ($terms as $term):
		extract($term);
		echo "$tag,";
	endforeach;

The above snippet will get me the top 5 source terms terms in the
desired category when I adjust the WHERE to be as

WHERE t1.taxonomy = 'category' AND p1.post_status = 'publish' AND
terms1.name = 'DESIRED CATEGORY NAME HERE' AND t2.taxonomy = 'Source'
AND p2.post_status = 'publish'

Not a SQL I recommend for using in high traffic sites but with some
transient caching, why not?

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_remote_get() fails but wget works?
Message-ID: <CAMg3evEEODoiOCkjomgV+Nmno6Pm89QTLQFar_7F_rH+gOE23Q@mail.gmail.com>

My WordPress Google Form plugin uses wp_remote_get() to retrieve the HTML
of a Google Form so in can be embedded into a WordPress site.  This has
worked great for a long time and my plugin has been pretty stable.

Last week Google introduced a significant update to Google Forms.  In
addition to a bunch of UI changes, the URL of the published form changed.

wp_remote_get() fails on any form created from scratch which has the new
URL format yet I am able to retrieve the form content without issue using
wget from the Unix command line.

I have been digging through the bowels of WP_Http trying to understand what
is happening and I am stumped.  Am hoping someone here can help me
interpret the response from Google and what I might be able to do about it.

wp_remote_get() returns the following:

(
    [0] => WP_Error Object
        (
            [errors] => Array
                (
                    [http_request_failed] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => Too many redirects.
                        )

                )

            [error_data] => Array
                (
                )

        )

)

I have captured a bunch of data and posted it on PasteBin:

   1. Complete wp_remote_get() Log
   2. wget Log
   3. wget Results

I am open to suggestions as right now I am out of ideas.  Increasing the
number of redirect tries didn't do anything other take it longer to fail.
 I am a bit worried that Google may be seeing my request as an XSS as this
appears in the wp_remote_get() log:

[x-xss-protection] => 1; mode=block

Thanks for looking at my problem.

Mike

By default, wget follows up to 20 redirects, which the manual admits "is
usually far more than necessary". wp_remote_get() follows five.

You can change this with 'redirection' => 20.

My WordPress Google Form plugin utilizes wp_remote_get() to retrieve the
contents of a Google Form and render it as part of a WordPress post or
page.  This has worked well for quite sometime.  Last week Google updated
Google Forms.  In addition to changing the UI and adding some new features,
the format of the published URL changed.  This should not have been an
issue as there wasn't anything specific about the URL my plugin was
dependent on.

However, my plugin no longer works with any newly Google Form that uses the
new URL.  I receive a "Too many redirects" error from wp_remote_get().

[04-Feb-2013 12:51:58 UTC] Array
(
    [0] =>
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bPgvlQ-zwdVVBmmLEC0YtUu-yf94rshDLbMPcUFbsCU/viewform
    [1] => Array
        (
            [sslverify] =>
            [timeout] => 30
            [redirection] => 10
        )

    [2] => WP_Error Object
        (
            [errors] => Array
                (
                    [http_request_failed] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => Too many redirects.
                        )

                )

            [error_data] => Array
                (
                )

        )

)

What is odd is that I am able to retrieve the form content using the Unix
wget command line utility. I am concerned I may be facing a situation where
Google views my request as a XSS request as this appears in the response:

[x-xss-protection] => 1; mode=block

I've been digging through WP_Http all morning trying to identify what might
be different and what I can do about it.  I am stumped.  I have posted the
log from WP_Http, the log from wget, and the results from wget to PasteBin
in hopes that someone who understands this lower level stuff better than I
do may have some ideas.


   1. wp_remote_get Log:  http://pastebin.com/WwnZiEB2
   2. wget Log: http://pastebin.com/jKMFbCpG
   3. wget Results:  http://pastebin.com/4FAeuei0

I've tried as many as 100 - the only thing different is it takes longer to
fail.

The X-Xss-Protection header is a standard header, that you get even while
using curl.

http://pastebin.com/SbjSnKFd

Since its complaining about too many redirects, and looking at the logs,
its getting stuck in the login loop for some reason.

One quick way of checking it would be to write a php script to fetch the
content from google groups and see if that works fine.

Message-ID: <CAHERW=2d4Q3z2oUYVf4vsjTK7rryyX7iTkX8U-QiyBRXiOCcYA@mail.gmail.com>

This is right from the wpdb codex (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb)

SELECT a Row
... If more than one row is returned by the query, only the specified
row is returned by the function, but all rows are cached for later
use. ....

My question is on the caching. Where is the cache kept? Are we talking
about a mysql server cache here? Or is there a transient like
implementation that I could not spot in the core?

The reason I found myself dealing with the cache matter is because
when I display the number of comments for the most popular posts, I'm
stuck with the old number of comments even though I programmatically
truncated the wp_comments and wp_commentsmeta, and there are
absolutely no records in those tables, but yet, I still see numbers
like 1,175 comments on display.

I do not have any caching plugins to blame. And the theme that I'm
using is using the plain old

comments_popup_link(__('No Comment','source'), __('1
Comment','source'), __('% Comments','source')); code.

What could be the reason of getting a display of old number of
comments on the display?

You're probably getting the number stored in the comment_count column from
the wp_posts table. To prevent having to recount comments (an expensive db
query) on the fly, the comment count is stored in the posts table and only
updated on comment-related actions (saving/approving a new comment on a
post, deleting a comment, etc.)

Look at the function wp_update_comment_count_now() to update comment counts
on all posts after doing a direct database manipuation.

If I had to guess, I'd say the Cookies are not being respected/applied
for the Redirects, which will most likely cause a redirect loop.
Hopefully that'll send you down the right rabbit hole..

I think you are right based on what I am able to see comparing wget results
to wp_remote_get() results.

When I run wget, it returns the Google Form content after the 5th redirect.

When I run wp_remote_get(), the first 5 redirects match the wget run
exactly but instead of returning the form content, I get another redirect
for something which has already been requested (the service login URL).
 Saving the cookies from the wget run I have 4 cookies:  PREF, NID, S, GAPS
 All of the cookies appear in the data I am dumping from WP_Http but never
at the same time.

I then tried the command line version of cURL and it behaves the same way
that wp_remote_get() behaves, timing out after 50 retries (the default).
 However, if I run cURL and feed it the cookies file I saved from wget it
works!

This is where I am bit out of my depth.  It seems the GAPS cookie is what
the login service is looking for but it doesn't come through the redirect
so it gets into a loop.  Should cookies accumulate through a series of
redirects?  Based on my experiments, I think they should (or at least I
need them to) and I think that is happening with wget but isn't happening
with wp_remote_get() but I am not entirely sure.

Is there a recommended tool for examining headers that I could use for both
wp_remote_get() and wget?

Is there a way to have cookies pass through a series of redirects?

Thanks,

Mike

Message-ID: <8E8117E5-DEF8-4E78-932D-F6D54853375E@markoheijnen.nl>

Today I was busy to make a really small plugin that handles my CDN for me and started to play with it so I can control it from another plugin when needed.

Now I'm curious what is better to do. For example when you want to offload JS, CSS and images to a CDN. Makes is more sense to use filter as 'script_loader_src', 'style_loader_src' and 'the_content' in favor of using ob_start with a callback. For me the first one seems cleaner then running a regex on the whole HTML.

If the first one is better does it make sense to be able to use a filter to modify the post object before it enters the cache instead of using the filter 'the_content'.
If I'm correct you can't do that at this moment.

Best regards,

Marko

Hi,

If it's a pull CDN your working with then take a look at Mark Jaquiths CDN drop-in that does that job pretty well

Hey Simon,

I saw that one and that is part of the reason I asked since Mark is using ob_start() for it.

Hi Marko

I find the problem with trying to filter individual elements is that you
can miss some, or some items that may be hard coded in the template etc.

At least if you filter the output buffer, you can't miss anything

I never did get this to work. :-/

This is bouncing you from the spreadsheet to the login page, then back.
 Their login page must be looking for something more than just a cookie.

I did find a few things to help get you further, though.

First, the WordPress HTTP API can handle cookies.  It just doesn't do so by
default.  The code says so:

// Cookies are not handled by the HTTP API currently. Allow for plugin
authors to handle it
// themselves... Although, it is somewhat pointless without some reference.

I have some sample code up that should work (dd32 will correct me otherwise
:-)).  It's PHP 5.3 (beware the closure)
https://gist.github.com/kurtpayne/4724289

If you remove the unlink call, you can inspect the cookie file afterwards
and verify that the proper cookies were set.

Second, google has published an article on using curl to access spreadsheet
data.  It's got some specialized authentication tokens, but it may be
appropriate to your needs:
https://developers.google.com/gdata/articles/using_cURL

Last, this plugin claims do what you're after
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpgform/

But it comes with this caveat: "Currently, this plugin only supports Google
Forms that are "Published as a web page" and therefore public. Private
Google Forms are not supported."  So it may be a known issue.

I hope this helps!

Thanks for taking a look at my problem.  Your example code gives me a
couple ideas to try.  I will take a look at the other links you pointed
out.  FWIW - the plugin you referenced (WordPress Google Form - wpgform) is
my plugin.  I am trying to resolve issues people are having now that Google
has updated Google Forms.  Fortunately there is still a way to create a
legacy form which is my current recommendation until I can resolve this.

Looking to add a share box below every image in the post, I am using a
regex, on the_content to match the first ahref img link and replace with the
img link plus the share code, curious if another way is better?

For some reason on 1 install it works fine, on another its stripping the p
tags.

Two different servers, 2 different themes, works on twentytwelve, the other
theme it doesn't, and I checked its just using the_content() and no
filtering done in functions.php

This may sound silly but does it work on both servers if you use the
default theme? Any plug-in installed?

	opposed to one call
Message-ID: <CAHERW=1OrHTVUpOoCmcoR4f9xcFeQqjFFdLSF0KkkfnDk4oLbg@mail.gmail.com>

This question can be formulated as

Would it make sense ( from the mysql quiery point of view ) to build a
functionality so that the following 2 liner code

$fields = array('field_1','field_2',....'field_10');
extract(get_post_metas($post->ID,$fields,true));

will practically be speaking equal to something like

$field_1 =  get_post_meta($post->ID,'field_1',true);
$field_2 =  get_post_meta($post->ID,'field_2',true);
...
$field_10 =  get_post_meta($post->ID,'field_10',true);

First approach will be done with a single but slightly more
complicated query whereas the latter will force 10 sql queries they
tend to be simpler.

What are your thoughts?

Post meta is cached when the post is retrieved, unless you specifically
turn it off (which would be self-defeating here), so the latter will not
force 10 SQL queries, and in fact, may not add any at all. See
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/39932/2226

Also: see get_post_custom().

Test this and you will find that the latter is just one query, total. When
you call get_post_meta(), all meta for that post is queried and cached.

Additionally, only the first argument to get_post_meta() is required. Call
it with just a post ID and you'll get back all metadata.

This may sound silly but does it work on both servers if you use the default

I assume that this caching is handled regardless of the
**define('ENABLE_CACHE',true);**.

What I'm curious though is how the caching is handled in this particular case?
Where does WP store the cached results for a get_post_meta?

In memory? As a file? in /cache folder as in define('ENABLE_CACHE',true);?

What's a good URL for learning more about this internal caching?

That constant does not exist in core, and has not for about five years.

In-memory, non-persistent object cache. A persistent object cache is used
if present.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Treating categories like tags
Message-ID: <5114BC1A.2060202@wordshell.net>

Hi,

I've got a site where the owner has so many categories, that he prefers 
to have the "categories" box on the post page appear like the "tags" box 
- i.e. have it not display the kitchen sink, but instead auto-complete, 
with an optional cloud.

A quick experiment shows that this can be changed by editing 
create_initial_taxonomies in wp-includes/taxonomy.php, and finding the 
register_taxonomy call, changing the 'hierarchical' parameter from 
'true' to 'false', and adding in some new 'labels' parameters (because 
by default non-hierarchical taxonomies get called 'tags').

However this leaves me with a couple of questions that I'm not sure on 
the best way to deal with. Can anyone advise?

* By making it non-hierarchical, hierarchy pages disappear (e.g. 
www.example.com/category/parent-cat/child-cat is now a 404). I suppose 
the owner will want these to automatically redirect, in this example to 
www.example.com/category/child-cat. What would be the best practice on 
how to do this? (It may be a moot question, as I haven't checked that 
the owner has any nested categories. But I and perhaps others would 
learn something anyway).

* Are there likely to be any other issues in converting an existing 
hierarchical taxonomy to a non-hierarchical one? In particular, any 
issues in converting this particular, built-in-default one? What 
side-effects might this have; or is there a better way I can solve my 
problem?

Many thanks,
David

I haven't verified that what I'm going to suggest won't cause other problems but have you tried using an 'admin_init' hook to modify the 'hierarchical' parameter from 'true' to 'false' but only for when $pagenow is either 'post.php' or 'post-new.php'?  That way on non-admin page loads they are and the category section on the admin won't have been modified to treat them an non-hierarchical (but I can't promise there won't be side-effects I'm not considering.)

We've found similar approaches have worked well for us in the past.

Perhaps the cheapest way to do this would be to:

 * Use the category to tags converter (listed as an importer in the admin)
to convert everything to tags.
 * On the Permalinks screen, set the tag base to 'category', and the
category base to something else.

You'll end up with a non-hierarchical taxonomy that keeps the same URLs.

Message-ID: <CAHERW=2jA3z4x=cac=Lez=-5Ld+=x+JKuO6PUjw8atGNZFE8cA@mail.gmail.com>

I run this;

	global $wpdb;  //wpdb is the wordpress database class
	var_dump ($wpdb->query( "UPDATE $wpdb->posts SET comment_count=0"));

And I get this by the var_dump

int(19979)

then I reload the php page again ( to execute same SQL ) and the
var_dump reports

int(0)

Should not this query always effect 19979 records?
I thought the number of recs effected is really whatever the where
scope happens to be covering.
Since there are 19979 recs in the posts table, I was expecting this
operation spans/touches/operates/whateveer very you want to call it
all the recs!

I guess whether the values in the comment_count field was 0 or not
seffect the return of the  wpdb->query.

Is this a mySQL behaviour? or does wordpress do something here? Or is
there somesort of a caching involved?

The query call is returning the number of rows modified.

If the query results in no modifications (because you already ran it and
changed the data) then you will get 0 returned;

If you use a tool like phpmyadmin you might see the message "19979 rows
affected, 0 rows updated", which makes it clearer.

It is a MySQL efficiency.

On an UPDATE, MySQL will report the number of rows actually changed,
not the possible number of rows affected. If comment_count is already
zero, then your second update makes no change, and so it won't change
it or report that row as changed in the return value.

"If you set a column to the value it currently has, MySQL notices this
and does not update it."

"UPDATE returns the number of rows that were actually changed."

And that "none" will need to be added to the drop-down menu in the media
popup when galleries are created.

Use it on init hook!

This is a fairly bare bones article that displays the use of sessions with
WordPress.

Hello all

I'm just wondering if anyone here know how I can change the default
search to go from ?s= to ?keyword=. I've done the bit in
searchform.php file but when I go to test it, nothing happens.

Thankyou :)

You should be able to use the following code to generate a form that
uses your domain/keyword as the action location to pass the qet query
vars for the search query.


<form role="search" method="get" id="searchform" action="<?php echo
home_url( '/keyword/' ); ?>">
    <div><label class="screen-reader-text" for="s">Search for:</label>
        <input type="text" value="" name="s" id="s" />
        <input type="submit" id="searchsubmit" value="Search" />
    </div>
</form>

It's really simple. WordPress doesn't kill sessions. It just doesn't use them.

No offense pal but some respect and command of English would help in getting your point across. Don't give Turkey a bad reputation.

In fact, you'll find that basically every e-commerce plugin for
WordPress uses sessions, so it definitely doesn't kill them.

If sessions aren't working, it's possible that:

1) You're not doing session_start() early enough. It needs to be done
around the init hook (before body output)
2) A plugin is intentionally breaking them. Try disabling all other
plugins to double-check this.

Think about it, of all the core features of PHP, how many have you used in your entire programming career? Just because something exists doesn't mean you *have* to use it. Wordpress has a reasonable way to deal with the problem Sessions are meant to handle. Live with it.

Sessions is a feature of PHP but PHP has a lot of features.

WooCommerce for example isn't using sessions anymore. Because sessions don't work really well on multiple server.
That's also the reason why WordPress doesn't use them.

Sessions is a feature of PHP but PHP has a lot of features.

WooCommerce for example isn't using sessions anymore. Because sessions
don't work really well on multiple server.
That's also the reason why WordPress doesn't use them.

I guess the conversation is done then. Even with the rude start we tried to help you out the best we can.
Also there isn't a session problem in WordPress. Only a limitation in your PHP and search skills.

And I guess for you http://eamann.com/tech/introducing-wp_session/ is the way to go.

So if we cant use basic sessions what we should use alternative  of it?
What Wp functions is alternative sessions.

You can use basic session if you only deal with one server. Play with it and do some research and you will find out how to do so.

If you're having issues with sessions you might also check on your server
environment. If you're using CloudFlare or Varnish or any other server
level page-caching you'll have some issues.

... and sessions are not configured correctly on the large majority of
web-hosting solutions out there.

A surprisingly large number of web hosting configurations have
sessions enabled, but have the sessions directory configured to be
unwritable. Which results in some rather fun error messages whenever
you try to use them.

Sessions are, in general, a bad idea. Best to avoid them if at all
possible, unless you are writing code to run in an environment you
have full control over.

Can someone supplement this thread with what WordPress utilizes in lieu of
sessions? Maybe that could be used as an educational piece for the original
poster and why they probably shouldn't use them.

Nothing is stopping you from using sessions. As Otto writes, there are a
number of reasons why not to use sessions. WordPress has these reasons, and
others. WordPress, very simply, does not use them and has no need for them.

WordPress does not leverage or rely on any server-side session management.
WordPress sets and reads its own set of authentication cookies. In
wp-includes/pluggable.php, see:
wp_validate_auth_cookie(), wp_generate_auth_cookie(),
wp_parse_auth_cookie(), wp_set_auth_cookie(), wp_clear_auth_cookie().

WordPress uses a cookie to identify the user between requests, in the
same way that sessions would use a cookie to identify the session id.

But generally speaking, WordPress doesn't have any need to persist
variables between requests, so it doesn't need sessions or much of
anything similar. You could probably use user-meta instead for most
cases where sessions would be useful, unless you were trying to store
an large amount of data.

It might be interesting to hear from the original poster why he feels the need to use sessions.  According to Eric Mann there are times when they are needed but most of the time they are the wrong tool for the job.  Maybe we can easily suggest an alternative.

I would imagine there is a good chance, yes. I will bring it up for
discussion during tomorrow's weekly project meeting at 2100 UTC in

Likewise some hosting settings will cause WordPress to call 
wp_unregister_GLOBALS()  which can cause an early created session ID to 
be deleted and then when your site is fully loaded, you have a 
completely different session ID.

There's oddity there...

Replied in the forums, since it works for me, unless we're talking about your setting your permalinks to %category%/%postname% (which I just didn't test at this hour).

Permalink flushing just clears the cache, IIRC, it doesn't actually change permalinks.

This changes the author base for me on WP3.5.1.... I have it in an

Hello at all,

Im confused and can't find my problem on the repo of wp.org for plugins.

My Plugin Repo: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adminimize/

Inisde the svn I have add the tag 1.8.1 and 1.8.2
http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/adminimize/tags/

Inside the trunk folder
http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/adminimize/trunk/

is my dev version with a readme, there have the tad "Stable Tag" for
version 1.8.1. But WP send all Users a update message for version 1.8.2.
The download use the 1.8.1.zip

Please can you find my bug, my missunderstand. Thanks!

I will develop inside the trunk and release only, if I have tested and
ready the new version.

Best
Frank

Hey Frank,

It's your own mistake. You change the version number to 1.8.2 in the tag 1.8.1.
Also you shouldn't tag a version for the next release. You should do that only when you are ready to launch it.

Sorry to be a bit late to the party on this one.

Sessions work fine on multisite for WordPress, if coded correctly. 
Though admittedly they are a cousin of the devil.

Hey Rich,

I said multiple servers and not a multisite installation.

And sessions can work nicely on multiple servers, as long as there is a 
common storage place.

What I've done in the past is to setup a single memcache server used for 
session storage by all of the web heads.  It does not take up a lot of 
resources on the memcache server.  So it probably won't require a 
dedicated machine.  It works quite nicely when you are using something 
like SimpleSAMLphp, which requires sessions, integrated with the 
WordPress login process to give you SSO.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Child plugins (add-ons)
Message-ID: <511E8715.6000805@duechiacchiere.it>

Hello list,

given that last time I had a philosophical question about my plugin, I 
got great feedback from the list, here I am, again :)

As my plugin WP SlimStat grows bigger and bigger, users request new 
features, options and new ways to display their stats. So I thought that 
it would be nice to follow WordPress' lead, and avoid implementing all 
of them in core, and instead work on ways to extend its functionality: 
child plugins (or add-ons, if you like). In order to avoid overcrowding 
the main Plugins screen, I was thinking about recreating a separate page 
within my plugin's options, where users can manage their add-ons for 
SlimStat, just like they do with regular plugins (delete, install, 
deactivate, etc).

I've seen other plugins out there using the concept of 'child plugins' 
(where they have the API/Library/Core functionality and then a bunch of 
plugins relying on it), so I believe this idea of separating the 
maintenance and keeping the main Plugins area clean and well organized, 
is compliant with the direction WordPress is taking with version 2.6.

So my question is: would it make sense to recreate such a 'sub' 
management page. If yes, is there an easy way to do it (include 
wp-admin/plugins.php ?) without having to reinvent the wheel?

Thank you,
Dino.

Hey Dino,

If it is a part of your plugin then delete doesn't make sense. Just an option to make it active or not. The word 'Child plugin' would be wrong for this.
A 'Child plugin' for me would be a separate plugin that needs the main plugin because it uses the hook the main plugin has. Like a random BuddyPress plugin that obviously need BuddyPress.
So I guess you should look into your plugin and see if there are places where it make sense to add an action or a filter.

Hi Marko,

WP SlimStat already includes a number of actions and hooks that allow 
third-party developers to extend its functionality. A "separate plugin 
that needs the main..." is just one way of looking at things. If we 
apply your reasoning to Child Themes, then that naming is "wrong" as 
well, as they are usually extensions or customizations of existing 
themes, and not separate themes relying on their parents ;) But naming 
conventions aside, I believe it would be great to expand the Plugins 
Management interface to group (accordions?) plugins based on their 
relationships. I haven't looked at the way BuddyPress implements it, but 
it could be a good starting point.

Cheers,
Dino.

I understand that the sessions by default is configured to work with
files. that's how PHP comes with.
http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php

Given to two reasoning below, I'm curious to find out why the default is files?

db based storage solution is superior to file based solution.
db based solution won't have a problem with multiple servers.

Quite simply:
PHP does not come configured with a Database, that's Application-level
configurations.
PHP does however come by default with Temporary file storage available.

If you can setup servers and load-balance Applications over servers,
you can manage to configure the extra PHP configuration to give it
your preferred session storage.
PHP Sessions can even work over multiple servers using files, the
servers just need to be configured to use a centralised network
storage location.. but that requires extra PHP configuration to set
the directory..

Hey guys,
Is that just me? or the process of building a options page is extremely
complicated?

By my knowledge, I have to build a preproccessor/callback function to every
field-type/section/page part, and than mix them together by the API. Or
using the alternative - settings-framework who already implement it..
Is there something built in? or the current API is doens't know do handle
it yet(and its sucks comparing the alternatives like Drupal and the other
platforms).

Thanks,
 ~ AlmogBaku

Hey,
By my opinion the properly solution is to implement a *Dependency system*.
and and the ability to plugin requiring another pluging.

Assuming we're talking about a Theme: have you considered getting rid of
the Theme Options page, and instead hooking into the Customizer
API<https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API>,
to allow your Theme options to be configured via the Theme Customizer?

That said, I would love to see improvements to the Settings API that would
standardize common form fields, as well as standardize the proper
validation/sanitization for given data types. Such improvements *may* be in
the works <http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18285>.

Incorporating the Options Framework is a good option, since it abstracts
all of the form-field markup and sanitization by data type. I take a
similar approach with Oenology <https://github.com/chipbennett/oenology>,
and you're welcome to take a look at the code (it's all heavily documented
inline), and use anything you find helpful.

Regards,
Chip

Hey,

I think it looks more complicated than it is (depending on your
requirements, though).

For example, I wrapped the callback/field/section part into a single
function which calls the actual rendering methods, sparing me much of
the work you mentioned:
https://github.com/thsur/wordpress-unify-backend/blob/master/unify_backend/unify.php

Look out for the class named OptionsPage (line 231ff.), especially the
methods 'page' and 'add_section'.

The options page itself is registered in line 137 by calling
OptionsPage::register() on admin_init.

Hope this helps,
Robin

Hey guys,
I need to build an option page *for a plug-in*.. so the theme customization
api is pretty irrelevant.. but thanks.

Actually I looking for something much easy.. creating an object/array and
the wordpress will turn it to an actuall form with errors and validations
and even save the data.
I don't see any reason that there is no predefined callbacks for that..
I guess issue #18285 shoul'd solve it. but almost 2 years passed since it
was open :\

@Chip and @Robin, Thanks! it seems that I have to use the frameworks for
now.. or developing my own one.

Child plugins are absolutely the way forward.Turning on/off options in a single plugin isn't an overhead really, but it means that every time there is a bug-fix for a single feature the whole plugin must be updated.
I know we've stopped using Yoast's wonderful SEO plugin due to this.
We hit a stage where we had 4 updates in 1 week to fix a bug in a feature that we didn't have on, as it had nothing to do with SEO.
It's awesome that plugins are so well maintained, but there comes a point were we have to think of the non-dev/non-techie user first.

I tried this idea, once upon a time. Everybody hated it. Users found
it confusing and difficult to manage. Many complained about having
many plugins instead of just one. Things like that. It's a good idea,
and I personally like it, but hey, I'm a techie and so are you.
Non-technical users hate it. Switching to an all-in-one approach with
checkboxes to turn parts on and off basically ended those support
messages.

Hi Otto,

I see your/their point, and dependencies and child plugins are, in my
opinion, just two sides of the same coin.

This is related but not the same as Dino's problem, but perhaps 
interesting to some.

I recently have been thinking about add-ons to plugins, because I 
launched some paid add-ons to a free plugin (updraftplus.com).

Not an easy problem. I eventually went for this route:

1) The free, fully functional plugin is in the WordPress.Org directory
2) If anyone buys a paid extension, then they have to manually install a 
second plugin (NOT from wordpress.org), which is the add-ons manager
3) The second plugin switches the original plugin to get updates from a 
new location
4) In the second plugin, they enter their username + password (from the 
shop website). This then connects them back to the store where they 
bought the extension from. Once they've done that, updates appear to the 
original plugin. Those updates contain a version of the original plugin 
which now includes their add-ons.

To prevent me from maintaining multiple code-bases for the original 
plugin, internally I implemented that as a sub-directory from which any 
present .php files are require_once'd. So the only difference between 
the wordpress.org free plugin, and the plugin with add-ons is a few 
extra files in that directory.

It was quite a lot of code to write, though that's partly because I had 
to also write the code fort he shop site to process purchases and to 
keep track of entitlements as they were bought and consumed.

Hey David,

Thats seems weird to me. I have the same plan for a plugin and I'm writing the add-ons right now. I don't need to touch the free plugin on WordPress.org since it has the right filters already.
When you need to change the main plugin to enable paid extensions then your main plugin is wrong coded. In your case you don't even need to manipulate the main plugin.

I could however understand that you would have a main paid plugin that takes care username+password and the updates for the extension.

David and Marko,

paid add-ons are exactly what I?m planning to do with my plugin. At first I
had taken the same route as David?s, but then I realized it was an awful
lot of code to write, both for the store and the management part, and
that?s when I started looking at existing solutions like CodeCanyon or
WpXtreme as the channels to distribute those premium add-ons. But I would
still like to have a way to alert premium users when a new version of a
given add-on is available on one of those platforms, and that?s where I
might be able to reuse portions of David?s code (see? APIs once again would
encourage collaboration!). Which, by the way, doesn't seem ?weird? to me at
all ;)

I know this topic has been discussed many times, but maybe the time is ripe
to actually do something about it?

David, I will get in touch with you, thank you for sharing your thoughts!

I think you must have misunderstood me; my main plugin also accesses my 
add-ons' functionality via filters and equivalents.

The intricateness of the scheme is not for that; it's to allow users to 
receive their add-ons via the normal WordPress updating mechanism, to do 
so without breaching wordpress.org rules on remote code, to allow them 
to only install an additional plugin *once* (not once for every new 
add-on they buy), and finally to also have a dashboard display of what 
addons they have and have not purchased, thus indicating to them 
potential future purchases. Put those four requirements together, and I 
think you'll end up with the basic scheme I came up with. If you're not 
concerned to have all of those features, then you could simplify the scheme.

Interesting conversation.  Would you mind elaborating on those specifics?  I'm trying to envision what code is need for what you are saying.

The specifics of the updating mechanism? I'm using the library mentioned 
before to fetch update information, and updates, from my shop site. On 
the user's side, the add-ons manager plugin over-loads the URLs used to 
get update information and updates for the other plugin. That's easy 
enough. It sends along the user's identifying information. The shop end 
receives that information and passes back the update information in the 
right format. That includes a version number (which can depend on what 
add-ons they've bought; basically, add a new segment to the version 
number and use that to store add-ons information. If the plugin is at 
version 1.2, then 1.2.1 is used for '1.2 with 1 add-on'), or the 
download if requested. The download is created on-the-fly, again 
according to the purchased add-ons.

The shop-side also needs code to hook into the e-commerce platform and 
record new entitlements when purchased. So the flow goes like this:

1) User buys add-on in shop.
2) Upon payment, hooks fire to record that add-on purchase/entitlement 
in the shop's database
3) User visits their own site, and makes sure that they've got the 
"add-ons manager" plugin installed, and have entered their credentials 
for the shop.
4) The add-ons manager now indicates to the user that they've made a 
purchase, and invites them to claim it for this particular site. User 
clicks on a link to make that claim.
5) This generates an RPC to the shop, which now records that this add-on 
purchase is linked to that particular site.
6) The add-ons manager also forces WordPress to re-check for available 
updates at the same time.
7) The "any updates available?" request thus arrives at the shop, which 
indicates that yes, there are updates.
8) The add-ons manager is also at this stage telling the user to "follow 
this link to your updates page to claim your add-on"
9) User goes to normal WordPress updates page, and clicks on the link to 
update the plugin
10) WordPress requests the new zip from the shop. The shop constructs 
it, containing the new add-on, and delivers it to WordPress
11) WordPress installs the plugin, now containing the new add-on. The 
user now has the add-on.

So from the user's point of view, they:
1) Buy add-on from shop
2) Install add-ons-manager plugin and enter their shop credentials
3) Click on link in add-ons-manager plugin to claim the purchase
4) Click on link to perform update to actually receive that purchase on 
their site

It was far more code + complexity than I realised when I started! I'm 
thinking I'll try to clean up and market that lump of code next, it took 
so long to create! (I've ended up with two plugins - the add-ons manager 
that the user has; and the shop-side management plugin that does the 
fancy work at that end).

Wow, thanks for all the details.  

I now realize I should have been more clear what I was asking.  I was specifically interested in know what you meant about "without breaching wordpress.org rules on remote code" and what you did to stay within the rules?

That also implies a question as to what the rules actually are? I haven't seen anything listed on any of these links:

Lol!  Isn't it always?  I have a project where my hindsight was similar.  :)

What Marko was describing is very simple, actually. Take this function
as an example:

function plugin_do_something() {
// ... bunch of code here to do stuff ...
do_action('plugin_do_something');
}

Now, if he uses that as his free plugin, but then sells some other
plugin entirely as an add-on to the free plugin, then the paid code
can simply hook to the plugin_do_something action added by the free
plugin to do its work. Same goes for filters.

The basic idea here is the selling of additional functionality in the
form of an entirely separate plugin which merely uses available hooks
in the free plugin to get the job done. It either adds code at the
right spots to the free plugin, or it modified values from the free
plugin to do something entirely different.

An ecommerce plugin could be presenting a cart and a check-out button,
for example. An additional plugin (which isn't in the directory and
doesn't have to be free) could hook into that functionality to add
paypal support, or support for multiple carts, or whatever add-on code
you're selling.


See, David said this:
> To prevent me from maintaining multiple code-bases for the original plugin, internally I implemented that as a sub-directory from which any present .php files are require_once'd.

That implementation is kinda silly and overcomplicated. Instead of
having an "add-on manager", the add-on plugin can simply do whatever
changes need to be done. It doesn't need to change the main plugin to
include its files, including files is the basic definition of a plugin
in the first place.

Consider two plugins: a) Example-Free and b) Example-Add-on. The free
one is in the directory. The add-on one is not, and when it's
activated, it gets included by WordPress just fine. No need to make
Example-Free recognize its existence in any way at all, really. The
free plugin can remain perfectly as-is, and just *have* the necessary
action and filter hooks for the add-on plugin to use right in it.

Guideline 8: No sending executable code via third-party systems.
David's description of an "add-on manager" system that replaced the
free plugin with the paid version would not be allowed in the
directory.

However, as Marko pointed out, his scheme is too complex as well as
being completely unnecessary. The "base" plugin can easily be the free
one, not violate any guidelines of any sort, and still leave action
and filter hooks in it for the secondary, paid, add-ons to be sold
elsewhere (ie. not on wp.org). And as was pointed out earlier, it's
possible for a plugin to check for its own updates from anywhere.
Those add-on plugins can check for updates from wherever they're
hosted, while the free-base remains on wp.org.

Thanks, that's really what I was asking. It was more of a policy question vs. a technical one but I'm a "code thinker" so seeing code helps me understand.

OTOH would you mind clarifying "No sending executable code via third-party systems?"  It sounds like that would disallow the downloading of an add-on because that's sending executable code via a third party system?  Do you mind to clarify by giving a violating example?

Yes, it would and does disallow exactly that. However, the method I
described would not have code in the .org repository that does that.

You'd sell your add-on plugin on some other site, and have the user
install it manually. WordPress has a built in ZIP file uploader for
plugins that should make that relatively easy. Sell the user a ZIP
file, give them instructions on where to upload it on their site (no
need for FTP in most cases), and they can easily install that add-on
themselves.

The guidelines only apply to plugins hosted on WordPress.org. If
you're selling code from your own site, then that's not on wp.org.

I explained in an earlier message that the base plugin does leave action 
and filter hooks for the secondary, paid add-ons, and that the point of 
the scheme was not for that reason. The point of the scheme included to 
integrate with a shop that sells multiple add-ons, and provide the user 
with a console that showed them the other purchases that they could 
make, and have them only install an extra add-on *once*, instead of a 
new one each time they made a purchase. The scheme also provides, 
optionally, for plugin updates to be made available through the update 
mechanism on a per-site basis, instead of a 
buy-once-install-infinite-times model.

Hello

I have some complex searching to do, for which I'll need to build some
custom searches (db queries). I'm going to end up with 4 calls to
get_post() based on some custom query vars.

If possible, I'd like these to appear 'normally' using standard search.php
template loop. Is there a nice hook where I can stop WordPress performing
any queries itself, but still inject my own list of posts?

mod_php can do automatic updates just fine.

I put these in my wp-config.php and I've not had a problem since.

define('FS_CHMOD_DIR', (0755 & ~ umask()));
define('FS_CHMOD_FILE', (0644 & ~ umask()));

Hi Tom,
You can modify or replace the standard search query using the
'posts_search' filter. Here's a quick example:
https://gist.github.com/mbijon/4979627

There are also several tickets on Trac related to search. You may be able
to grab some of the SQL from there and shortcut some of your custom work.
* This one is open & may be included soon:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7394
*  This one was closed because it used MySQL's FULLTEXT, but if you have
that enabled it's a good example of making that work:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14722

I'm not sure what you're referring to.

The only thing I can see that relates to WordPress being "attached to a
specific domain" involves rewrite rules, and even that isn't so much
"attached a specific domain" as it is "attached to a specific position in
relation to the domain root". That is, if you move your site from
domain1.com to domain2.com, you shouldn't experience any problems at all
from WP.  (You may have issues with content, such as img src's or internal
links being specified by absolute urls, but that has been discussed ad
nauseum over the years and there are plenty of ways of working around that
issue.)

Where you might have problems is moving from domain1.com to
domain2.com/site1 or vice versa, because that will necessitate rebuilding
your permalinks. But that's also a simple process and well-documented.

Can you explain what you see the problem as being?

I have a feeling this is the root-relative vs absolute uri debate rearing

Also, could be related to the serialized data that has a domain specified;
hence, moving from domain a to domain b would be simple only if the number
of characters of domain a and domain b are the same.
But there are some plugins out there to help changing serialized data as
well, for example, http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-migrate-db/
Haven't tested it myself though.

Something else to add, some plugins such as wp-united stores the path
to the files on the file system )say /home/danielx6/www/forums/) in
the database (Such as where the config.php from phpbb is on the
server).

 Hi,

I can't display any screenshot in my plugin page http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pet-manager/screenshots/, something related to image sizes maybe?

http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pet-manager/trunk

In the readme validator is ok.

The markdown for the list is fine, but he doesn't seem to have a
/tags/1.1 directory, even though his Stable Tag is set to 1.1.

Also, his screenshots should really be in the assets directory...

Perhaps you should read my post on the topic:
http://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2012/09/13/last-december-we-added-header-images-to-the/

If you're a plugin author, and you have not subscribed to our plugins
site, then maybe you should do that. :)

Sorry, my bad, I grabbed the wrong link.

Try this one. It explains a lot of the readme.txt issues most people have:

Greetings,

Since 3.5 we now have a number of plugins and functionality currently
running the old media manager, which makes in inconsistent with the current
native behavior of WP Media and can confuse the user when different types
of modal windows appears.

Is there an easy way to switch to the new media manager automagically?
Looked at trac to see if any tickets regarding that was open but couldn't
find any.

Regards,
Per

I thought that screenshot should stay within assets indeed :)

If there were a way, the core developers would have implemented it, instead
of showing the old thickbox and having an inconsistent UI.

That said, here's a tutorial that shows how to use the new media modal:

Message-ID: <CAHERW=3nGFO30bCvB7EBhRzbA=Ff4n7fOg-zCNB6ShS0kBHSpg@mail.gmail.com>

Say you got this in your code;

$post_tag_term_list = get_the_term_list( $post->ID, 'post_tag', "", "
* ", "" );

well, $post_tag_term_list terms would be in an alphabetical order;
such as in "adam", "george",  "zach".

I may be wrong in my following assumption, but getting the order in
the original way ( the way it was entered at the time of publishing
that post ) may come in handy from time to time.

I'm assuming that naturally, you would enter the tags for your post
starting from the most relevant item to the least. That's just how
mind works I think.

So, if the post were to be mostly about "zach", but it also mentions
"george" and "adam", I probably would tag the post starting with
"zach", automatically, then I threw the other ones in as "george",
"adam" or as "adam, "george". ( I may not be consistent in the order
for the less significant items in the post ( "george" and "adam" ),
but probably, I would almost always start with the biggest ticket item
("zach") . See what I mean? Maybe I am just wrong but could someone
give me a hint as to how I can get the get_the_term_list to give me
the list in the term_relationships id order?

My goal is to pick the main tag out of the post, and then do things with it.

Message-ID: <CAAVCQdF__jQyb4onyjK0JzgAGazRnhvLo8jWAErDXmmf0od4Ag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I've been searching and searching and I can't find the right or even one(!)
approach to this:
1) I have groups of users based on a usermeta key -> associated with a
single custom post type thanks to Advanced Custom Fields plugin.
2) I have 3 roles: owner, editor, consultant. The first two are WP
'editors' and the 'consultant' can only create but do not edit even it's
own posts (yet to figure out if I can do this last bit).
3) Question is: I need to allow the users within it's a group to be able to
see their own posts on the Posts list on the backend. I bet it has
something to do with if is admin grab current user usermeta_key
'group_name' then grab users ID's with that key value and set the query to
show only those authors ids, right? if so or.. if not so (ha) could you
point me out the direction for this please? I'd also like to restrict the
access to posts that have not been created by the same group of authors.

Thanks in advanced!

Hi Everyone,
First time posting here, so please bare with me :)

I am working on a site that is using the Yoast wpseo plugin and noticed
that even if you leave the SEO fields empty the plugin will store an empty
row into the wp_postmeta table. That made me think about how I should use
meta boxes.

So my question is:
When I use custom meta boxes should I also insert empty rows into the
wp_postmeta table or I should check to see if the fields is empty and if it
is, do not store anything? With small websites that my be not a problem but
when you have 50k+ posts and have ~10 custom post meta boxes and 11 form
the SEO plugin that adds up very fast.

Thanks,
Radi.

A plugin I do (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/developers-custom-fields/)
used to create DB records even if nothing was entered into the custom
field. I changed it to not create a record if the value is empty, also
to delete the existing record if it exists, but the new value entered
is empty.

No problems so far - I think in retrieving values you get the same
result from an empty record as from no record.

I'd be interested to hear if anyone else has alternate views on this.

Cheers,

Steve

Howdy folks,

Is there a way to tell WordPress not to send an email to the admin user after an installation? I do a lot of installs for customers and I would prefer to only send them a message from me with the credentials and some other info. The email sent during the installation procedure is preempting my message and sometimes causes confusion.

Thanks,

Victor

Victor,

Try creating an mu-plugin with this code:

// Don't send out the "your new WordPress site" e-mail
add_filter( 'wp_mail', 'cancel_new_site_email' );

/**
 * Don't send the welcome e-mail
 * @param type $args
 * @return array
 */
function cancel_new_site_email( $args ) {
	if ( __( 'New WordPress Site' ) === $args['subject'] ) {
		$args = array(
			'to'          => '',
			'subject'     => '',
			'message'     => '',
			'headers'     => '',
			'attachments' => array()
		);
	}
	return $args;
}

That should prevent the new install e-mail from going out.

Same here: Only create DB entries when they contain information.
Use "not existing" equal to "empty" => if empty, delete.

Porting WordPress from one domain to another is well documented and
relatively easy - yes, but still requires messing with database (has
anything changed in this direction? 'cause I keep doing some find and
replace queries after I move it from one place to another). I just do not
understand why it is necessary in first place. But obviously I do not see
whole picture. That's why this question.

Subject: [wp-hackers] show 2 random posts from the last 20 posts from the
	Featured category
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2ZeePJ_101m7_yF2v5pK=ra+V_cjavBJW8_BtHn71nQQ@mail.gmail.com>

When you want to show 2 random posts from the last 20 posts from the
Featured category, what's the best way to handle it?

When I go,

$args = array(
   'category_name' => 'featured',	
   'posts_per_page' => 2),

it pulls the last 2 posts from the featured cat. Obviously no
randomness can be achieved as such. It's the same as asking gimme the
last 2 posts from featured.

If I go

$args = array(
   'category_name' => 'featured',	
   'posts_per_page' => 2,
   'orderby' => 'rand'),

then I get the two 2 random posts. but then, recent'ness goes out the
window. I may be randomly picking featured posts that are as old as
the website is.

For a moment, I thought the following would have worked.

$args = array(
   'category_name' => 'featured',	
   'posts_per_page' => 20,
   'orderby' => 'date rand'    //notice the double order by here
);   // inspired by the
http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Order_.26_Orderby_Parameters
codex entry.

I thought, this would have first picked the last 20 posts, and then
randomly shuffle the order and then return the results. If that were
to work, I would have exited the while loop at iteration 2 achieving
my goal.
But that too fails. It totally ignores the second aspect, the 'rand'
that is. and you always get the  recent 20 in the most recent to least
recent order.

So, how do you achieve that original goal which is "show 2 random
posts from the last 20 posts from the Featured category"?

Message-ID: <CAHERW=0mndoFAYibA3=a73Ky_+xR=CBXjGGB_xcxYOJbZNv84w@mail.gmail.com>

Could someone guide as to what the convention is when we see a
wordpress function which starts with one of these

the_X()

get_the_X()

wp_the_X()

wp_get_the_X()

and very rarely some core functions start with _.

as to the template tags, the convention is easy to understand, the_X
outputs the X inline, whereas get_the_X returns the value.

But for all the rest, not too sure.

Thinking out loud, you could query for the last twenty posts returned in
random order, and pull the first two of off the results.

Another thing that you can do is to generate two numbers with the rand()
function (between 0 and 19) and then make two queries with the offset
parameter respectively:

$query1 = new WP_Query( 'offset'=$offset1 );
$query2 = new WP_Query( 'offset'=$offset2 );

That would not not take from the last 20 recent featured ones though.

but anyway, with a little research, I think the following does the job.

shuffle( $my_query->posts );

Run this, right before the while loop abd whatever is in the posts
array ( last 20 featured posts for example ), get shuffled.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Pagination for custom loops
Message-ID: <CAFQFuXNeE76p3YegGwha7whTr1VAJEAum0cRkaai1_38nXsxuQ@mail.gmail.com>

How do people handle pagination for custom loops (new WP_Query instances,
not $wp_query)?

It would be great to use the same function calls as the main loop
(eg. get_previous_posts_link()), but these all rely on $wp_query. I've been
hi-jacking $wp_query and resetting it with wp_reset_query() afterwards, but
then I just feel like I've used query_posts, and become sad.

Am I missing an obvious solution, or is there a better way to my own method
short of writing all my own navigation calls?

I've done the following in several projects ...

$custom_query = new WP_Query($query_args);

if($custom_query->have_posts())
{
     // set up the pagination links
     $pagination = array(
                     'base'      => home_url().'/page-slug/%_%', //or: 
@add_query_arg("page","%#%"),
                     'format'    => 'page/%#%', // %#% is replaced by 
the actual page number
                     'total'     => $custom_query->max_num_pages,
                     'current'   => $page,
                     'show_all'  => false,
                     'end_size'  => 1,
                     'mid_size'  => 2,
                     'type'      => 'plain'
                 );

     // get the pagination links
     $pagination_links = paginate_links($pagination);

     // display the pagination links above the listing
     $html .= '<div id="pagination-top" 
class="pagination">'.$pagination_links.'</div>';

     while($custom_query->have_posts())
     {
         $custom_query->the_post();

         // put together the html for the post
     }

     // display the pagination links below the listing
     $html .= '<div id="pagination-bottom" 
class="pagination">'.$pagination_links.'</div>';
}

What's on line 1065 of ms-functions.php?

Possibly a line break/ empty space?

Try removing it.

Hello Lee... but this is a WordPress core file.... I did not mess with the
core files :)
I'm reporting to let the developers know that the error is occurring.

Thanks!

If I'm doing a custom query that requires pagination, I try my best to make
it the main query on the page (customize with pre_get_posts). But sometimes
you just have to override $wp_query to paginate a custom query.

global $wp_query;
$wp_query = new WP_Query( $args );
...
wp_reset_query();

You may want to run a diff against this and a 'fresh' copy of the file.
Many times when I've seen similar errors its because of a virus that has
infected the WP core files.

Deactivate all plugins. If that fixes it, one of your plugins is the issue. Re-enable them one by one until the issue reappears... you now have your culprit. Contact the plugin author for a fix or switch to a different plugin.

If that does not fix it, reinstall WordPress (the auto installer can do this for you) to insure something hasn?t altered that file (e.g. malware, a script gone awry, disk corruption, etc).

If after all that it's still happening and you still think it's a core bug, this if the correct process to follow:

I have no plugin installed. It is a fresh installation.

ah! yes, my bad - didn't read the path correctly.

In that case, check any plugins you've installed - best option is to turn them all off then 1 by 1 back on again.
Also, try using the default theme and see if the error still occurs.

Trail and error.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Isn't it a problem for WP that it is so strictly
 attached to a specific domain?
Message-ID: <CAEk_d2FiG0n79mW6BpDKGUW0Hemgi_eh_sxghj5k9g40U+CksA@mail.gmail.com>

This is an annoyance, particularly if you were, say, trying to do
administration via a secure URL. Also, I tend to backport production data
to a testing instance which normally would make it unusable until adjusted.

I set the following two constants in my wp-config.php files in each
environment so that I don't have to mess around with the DB all the time.

define('WP_HOME', 'http://sub.domain.tld');
define('WP_SITEURL', 'http://sub.domain.tld');

You're trying to do a wp_redirect() somewhere after headers were sent, so
this error occurs. Try to move your redirect call earlier on the page load.

Line 876 on pluggable.php is:

'header("Location: $location", true, $status);'

inside the wp_redirect() function.

I have no plugins installed here and I'm not trying to do anything more.
Just want to add a new user on the network of blogs.

This email was only a bug/error report....


Thank you!

Miriam de Paula.

In my experience:

   - the_X() - These are called "Template Tags". Generally, they echo a
   formatted version of their "get_the_X" counterpart, though there are
   several exceptions to this.
   - get_the_X() - Returns something (usually used by Template Tags)
   - wp_the_X() - Basically the same as the_X() but not as front-facing as
   Template Tags. They *are* public functions though
   - wp_get_the_X() - Returns something (usually used by wp_the_X()
   functions)
   - _X() - Private functions for use by WordPress core only.

Anybody else, CMIIW.

Rafael is correct about internationalization functions. I didn't really
spell out the distinction between translation functions and private core
functions.


   - _wp_words()
   - _words()

^ Are generally the format private core functions take.

Most/all internationalization functions like those listed by Rafael live in
wp-includes/l10n.php

your info helps.

but for example, when you look at the "wp_list_categories" example, it
definitely qualifies as a template_tag, but yet, it still starts with
wp_
it could perfectly be front-facing as the other template tags which
tend to be more popular.

This makes me think...

Could the wisdom be that if the template tag in subject is designed to
be used within "the loop", then it should start with prefix "the_" and
otherwise, it should start with the prefix "wp_"?
Could that be the key in understanding the convention?

The key would be to not look into it too much. Everyone is mostly
correct about the conventions mentioned here, except that WordPress
never had these conventions years ago, and many methods were never
updated (concerns with backwards compat typically), and now a lot of
it is just mixed.

I'm still not 100 percent sure of what the question is. I can say one thing, though: WP is very good at maintaining one URL for each page, which I definitely see as a feature rather than a bug. For a number of reasons, including SEO, it's generally discouraged to run parallel sites (where a.com/my-page == b.com/my-page)

Regarding storing full paths in the database: With decent architecturing you can get around those issues fairly easily. You shouldn't, for example, be storing full absolute paths of any file in the db.

Porting WordPress from one domain to another is well documented and
relatively easy - yes, but still requires messing with database (has
anything changed in this direction? 'cause I keep doing some find and
replace queries after I move it from one place to another). I just do not
understand why it is necessary in first place. But obviously I do not see
whole picture. That's why this question.

Thanks for letting us know Lee.

This was caused by a error in the Portuguese translations, the
translation for the email used %4$s instead of %3$s, It should be
fixed up in the next release of the Portuguese versions (I've just
suggested the alterations on Glotpress)

Cheers

You shouldn't store a full, absolute URL to anything in the DB for the
same reasons, unless it's an external resource, and even then,
software like Trac and MediaWiki have intertrac/interwiki links for
the most common ones. It can always be generated on the fly for
various purposes such as RSS if necessary. A good S3 plugin wouldn't
store absolute URLs for resources either.

However, this is a very pointless discussion since I have seen this
debated ad nauseum, and there's nothing new anyone can add that would
change the core teams' decision to stick with the way WordPress has
historically always referenced resources in posts, pages, and other
various locations. It doesn't matter how much more flexible WordPress
could be in various development and production configurations, that's
just the way it is. If this bothers anyone, don't use WordPress.

Thanks Nacin

I ended up solving it in 2 parts, I think.

First I built a simple custom SQL query to get post_ids (with a second,
optional query to get another list and intersect them).
Using pre_get_posts filter, I grab those post IDs to set up $wp_query
(using sortby=>post__In)
Then add 3 filters on posts_where, posts_join and posts_orderby to order by
a specific taxonomy.

I am using pretty URLs for all this, and pagination is an issue now.
WordPress recognises the page numbers enough not to have them leak into the
other query vars. But page/paged wont populate nicely. Perhaps I should
start a new thread for that.

Tom

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adding pagination to custom/complex pretty (search)
	permalinks
Message-ID: <CAEgmxab0y2xDcVYp7u9hMAiuv=xtECYqJyhorCg1O3csozVSgw@mail.gmail.com>

I've added 3 additional query_vars to WordPress. One is an end point (and
hopefully not relevant).

The other two are used to drill through search results, and I would like
them paginated. They are 'mycat' (custom taxonomy) and 'distance' (value
derived using SQL query).

I have three rewrites:
  add_rewrite_rule( '^search/([^/]+)/mycat/([^/]+)/distance/([^/]+)',
'index.php?s=$matches[1]&mycat=$matches[2]&distance=$matches[3]', 'top' );
  add_rewrite_rule( '^search/([^/]+)/mycat/([^/]+)',
 'index.php?s=$matches[1]&mycat=$matches[2]',                      'top' );
  add_rewrite_rule( '^search/([^/]+)/distance/([^/]+)',
'index.php?s=$matches[1]&distance=$matches[2]',                   'top' );

These are all working fine. However pagination doesn't work out of the box.
Will I have to manually add all the page=>paged and double up my rewrites?
Or is there a nice way to get WP to pass along the pagination?

These all work:
/search/pianist/
/search/pianist/page/2/
/search/pianist/mycat/gold/
/search/pianist/distance/50/
/search/pianist/mycat/gold/distance/50/

The first two get picked up by core, the latter 3 by my rewrites.

These don't work:
/search/pianist/mycat/gold/page/2/
/search/pianist/distance/50/page/2/
/search/pianist/mycat/gold/distance/50/page/2/

I can just add a rule for each:
  add_rewrite_rule( '^search/([^/]+)/distance/([^/]+)/page/([^/]+)',
'index.php?s=$matches[1]&distance=$matches[2]&page=$matches[3]',  'top' );
  ...

But wondered if there was a nicer way?

Tom

But that's expected Bryan. I know that it won't be dead accurate.
Still though, its nice to be able to know the difference or the
approach.

Wordpress evolved over the years with a great deal of
participation,dedication, thought process. And when you look at the
codex, you still see a great structure and certain coding coding
standards in play and this  seems to be quiet consistent.

Anyway thanks everyone on this. As you said it's not that of a big deal.

Subject: [wp-hackers] coding standards on if.
Message-ID: <CAHERW=26P5JGyucY_EMizq5zxrvij4xW7FiWHrRi8DXUpOD1qg@mail.gmail.com>

On this page ( http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards ),
there is a section on if statements - which goes like this...

Single line blocks can omit braces for brevity:

if ( condition )
>     action1();


and a few the lines down the page, we also have a section that says


In general, readability is more important than cleverness or brevity.



This matter is of course very subjective. Yes, there is PEAR standards and
there is also the WordPress and in between there are a lot of give and
take.. I get that.
And I understand the logic as to why

if ( condition ) {
    action1();
}

may not be preferred over the none curly bracketed alternative; it's the
brevity that is and it's the "c'mon dude it's a one liner so what's so
complex about it" approach. So I can see that point of view.

But isn't there a contradiction between this approach and
the approach which guides you that "readability is more important than
cleverness or brevity."

To me, the concept of "readability" is more how the readability is now...
As time goes, your code grows and you find yourself trying to read the page
from top to bottom and your eyes are already trained to look for the
closing brackets or the "endif:" to trace where the code structures close.
The closers do help vertically all the time.  So, when we allow a none
closer ( as in the example ), the readability is effected.

Plus, when you need to add more lines under that if condition sometime down
the road, it's no longer it's just an insert anymore, cause in that case
you are forced to add the curly brackets to make it all work.
This kind of approach goes against the wisdom as to why we should have the
final comma (,) just before we close that final associative array element.

I was just wondering.. wouldn't it be better that if the codex were to
suggest that even though the single line if's may look attractive to drop
the curly brackets, it is still better to stick to the curly brackets
methodology all the time and that's all for the sake of consistency with
the rest of the coding standards and readibility and usability down the
road.

That's how I look at it.

Since there are great minds in this list and centuries of coding experience
combined, I wanted to pick your brains and see what would be the counter
argument to my point.

Is Yoast doing it wrong?

Is there a situation when you need to store empty meta_value?

"Doing it wrong" can be subjective. If I was him, I'd store all the
relevant meta information in a single array, then store that array in
a single meta-key.

The question of whether you store empty data vs. not have the data, or
even whether you store data in an array form (which means it's
serialized) comes down to what you are using the data for, and in what
way you are using it.

For a case where you're never searching on that meta-data or ordering
by it, or using it in any other way except to perhaps display it
somewhere, then the single meta entry makes more sense. The idea being
that every case where you get the data, you're going to get all of it,
and only display it.

If you need to sort by it in some fashion, or search based on it, then
obviously storing it with its own key and in a non-serialized form
makes the most sense. These sorts of things happen in SQL, and the SQL
language does not understand serialized data.

As for empty vs. non-existent, there can be a difference between the
two, so which is correct depends on your particular use case and
whether or not there is a tangible difference in the behavior. Mostly,
I doubt it matters that often.

As for number of rows, that shouldn't be your primary concern. If you
start reaching a point where table sizes grow too big, then you should
start optimizing the database structure itself in mySQL, outside of
the web application level. Additional servers, dedicated servers, that
sort of thing. You cannot run a million posts on a cheap shared
database server, no matter how much the client might want to. Consult
a qualified DBA.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Can we get some codex updates about new media panel?
Message-ID: <CABZBZDs4S2nrHBjucfx=C27cVBvo6ubbYqEjnXmuvje6rtH45w@mail.gmail.com>

With WordPress 3.5, media panel started to use backbone.js.
It seems so nice and powerful but it need advanced javascript knowledge.
I believe %99 of WordPress developer community is new to backbone.js and
there is not much guide for newbies. ( Or maybe i couldnt find )
Codex dont have any API explanation or something for backbone.js and sadly
all old filters/actions are just not supporting in wp3.5
like attachment_fields_to_edit (didnt try adding new field. just tried to
remove default ones)
An example:
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/87677/wp3-5-media-gallery-edit-modal-change-captions-to-title
This question was normally simple with old panel but its nearly impossible
for me at the moment.
Can we get some codex updates about new media panel?

You'll find many people with very strong opinions both agreeing with and
opposing yours; however, this list is not the place to debate the propriety
of guns.

Message-ID: <DF180A4E-6D03-4232-9C10-207F1B23AF21@neilpie.co.uk>

The only time I experience issues with this is when trying to get the meta-data into a column in the wp-admin listings table and making that column sortable. 

The MySQL joins that are used when WP queries data in the postmeta table will leave any non-existing rows out of the result set, whereas existing but 'empty' rows are returned. In the first case it can confuse the user by displaying different numbers of results than an unsorted search, and post totals don't match up.

If I'm doing_it_wrong then I'd love to know the right way to add postmeta into a sortable column in the admin tables - it will save me a real headache and what feels like an awful hack in one of my plugins that is certainly otherwise unnecessary.

Thanks,
Neil

Message-ID: <7.0.0.16.2.20130225205132.01021038@avantigroup.com>

Hi WP-Hackers ... i'm hoping someone on this list might be able to 
help shed light on why my wp_remote_get function is generating fatal 
errors ...

the php error log says "Cannot use object of type WP_Error as array 
in /mysite/wp-content/themes/mychildtheme/functions.php on line 288" ...

said line 288 is this one -> if ( 200 == $resp['response']['code'] ) {

and my entire function is listed below ... this function is calling a 
text file thus not sure if that is the problem in that wp_remote_get 
only works with html files (e.g., head, title, and body tags) ..??.. 
or if i am missing something more basic (e.g., like a comma between 
['response'] ['code'] or what ..??..

accordingly, thanks in advance for any pointers that can be shared 
... cordially, chuck scott


===============
here is my function that iis responsible for error ->
===============
function myfunkyfunction() {
         $resp = wp_remote_get( 
'http://mydomain.com/dir1/dir2/dir3/my-text-file.txt' );
         if ( 200 == $resp['response']['code'] ) {
                 $body = $resp['body'];
                 }
         else {
                 $body = "Oops - sorry there was a problem loading the stats";
         }
         return $body;
}
add_shortcode('woi102stats','myfunkyfunction');


ps - i'm using latest version of WP 3.5.1 and this function is on a 
sub site on a multisite network - not sure that matters but mention 
just in case ..??..

Try dumping the $resp after the call to wp_remote_get()

Add this line before the IF

echo "resp<pre>". print_r($resp, true) ."</pre>";

See what the full WP_Error reads. You should always check the return value before just processing. 

My thoughts anyway.

Firstly, you should have some kind of caching on that, wp_remote_get()
will not cache the data and will fetch it every time you call it.

Next, you should check the return from the function.
It can return a WP_Error instance if an error occurs, you can check
for that with the is_wp_error() function, so:

function myfunkyfunction() {
        $resp = wp_remote_get(
'http://mydomain.com/dir1/dir2/dir3/my-text-file.txt' );
        if ( ! is_wp_error( $resp ) && 200 == $resp['response']['code'] ) {
                $body = $resp['body'];
                }
        else {
                $body = "Oops - sorry there was a problem loading the stats";
        }
        return $body;
}
add_shortcode('woi102stats','myfunkyfunction');

And also, there are helper functions for this.

wp_remote_retrieve_response_code()
wp_remote_retrieve_header()
wp_remote_retrieve_body()
etc.

If there is a failure and the response is a WP_Error, then these functions
return a zero-length string. Helpful when anything other than a 200 should
be considered an error.

Subject: [wp-hackers] JavaScript related functionality failure on some admin
	pages. 3.5.1
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2xzEMkE9YkmK5-fZ+UY8KOv=cMH+4rd8TxqN5PKHg3mg@mail.gmail.com>

On 3.5.1 installs, ( and I got two of them ), the admin area JS actions (
such as the "Screen Options" or the "Help" pull downs and a whole bunch of
more functionality that relies on DHTML effects) all fails.

To troubleshoot the problem, I checked the JavaScript console ( chrome
developer tools ), and I saw a 404 being reported in there.

GET .../wp-admin/*load-scripts.php*
?c=1&load%5B%5D=admin-bar?alog,wpdialogs,wplink,wpdialogs-popup,wp-fullscreen,media-upload&ver=3.5.1
404 (Not Found) post.php:41

And this 404 comes up only on some pages at the admin interface.

For example, when adding a new post ( using the /wp-admin/post-new.php ),
there is no 404 issue and thus no js issues. Everything works like a charm.
But once the post is published and the /wp-admin/post.php responses back, I
get that 404 back again and that's when all the js issues are back.

I don't know what's causing this, but the following one-liner in the
 wp-config.php totally fixes it.

*define('SCRIPT_DEBUG', true);  *

which is not recommended to keep it on a production site.

So I got this dilemma now. What do I do?

To eliminate the problem, I not only switched our current theme to
the TwentyEleven( to see if theme is the culprit ),  but no, it wasn't.
Symptoms were the same with TwentyEleven.
I also deactivated all the plugins one by one but no luck... this did not
help neither.

So to get going, I had to leave the SCRIPT_DEBUG option on...

But, what's your advise for getting rid of this issue without the
SCRIPT_DEBUG being TRUE?

And out of curiosity, what is it with define('SCRIPT_DEBUG', true); that it
magically fixes the problem?

Thank you for your reply Aaron. But no, we have not installed that plug in.

As I said in my original post, I went thru the ritual of deactivating all
my plug ins including reverting to the twentyEleven.

Here is some more insight about this issue..

I do not have to live with the define('SCRIPT_DEBUG', true), I can
perfectly comment it out and use this instead;

define('CONCATENATE_SCRIPTS', false);

That works too. So I will be keeping that on as of now.

What I've also observed was this, whenever I use SCRIPT_DEBUG(TRUE) or
CONCATENATE_SCRIPTS(FALSE) solutions, the following takes place on the VIEW
SOURCE;

With them,  I get this on the source

<script type='text/javascript'
src='..../wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.8.3'></script>

Without, I get the following,

<script type='text/javascript'
src='....wp-admin/load-scripts.php?c=1&amp;load%5B%5D=jquery,utils,plupload,plupload-html5,plupload-flash,plupload-silverlight,plupload-html4,json2&amp;ver=3.5.1'></script>

which is exactly where the 404 was stemming from.

I read the codex on the  SCRIPT_DEBUG (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress#SCRIPT_DEBUG )
which has the following to say...

SCRIPT_DEBUG is a related constant that will force WordPress to use the
> "dev" versions of core CSS and Javascript files rather than the minified
> versions that are normally loaded.



I rather leave the one-liner *define('CONCATENATE_SCRIPTS', false);* in the
config, than leaving the other one liner which is* the
define('SCRIPT_DEBUG', true);*
*

The base problem here is that you're getting the 404 error on the
load-scripts.php URL. Using the options you're describing "fix" the
problem because you're not using that load-scripts URL anymore.

So the question you need to focus on is why you're getting that 404 in
the first place. Does the file exist? Do you have some .htaccess rules
interfering? Anything of that sort. This is a problem that you will
find the answer to on the webserver, not within WordPress itself.

You are absolutely right Otto.

I tried loading the "load-scripts.php" ( by getting its full 404
URL straight from the Chrome's JavaScript's console with all the
querystring attached to it  ) and pasting it into my browser to see what
would happen...

And I ended up with a

HTTP Error 404.15 - Not Found

which fires when *The request filtering module is configured to deny a
request where the query string is too long. *
*
*
I remember that we had configured the querystring allowed max length on our
IIS server quiet some time ago. So whenever the querystring is too long,
the attacker simply gets a 404.

Your insight was right that it was our server where the solution lied.

However, I'm curious to see if there are ways for WP to find alternative
solutions to keep the QS as short as possible, I know this is quite tricky
but maybe all the wp must have ( required by the core ) scripts may be
dropped from that open list.

In case, you guys are wondering what I'm talking about, here is that QS
that's fed into the load_scripts.php

c=1
&load%5B%5D=admin-bar,hoverIntent,common,thickbox,schedule,wp-ajax-response,autosave,jquery-color,wp-lists,quicktags,jquery-query,admin-comm
&load%5B%5D=ents,suggest,jquery-ui-core,jquery-ui-widget,jquery-ui-mouse,jquery-ui-sortable,postbox,post,underscore,shortcode,backbone,media
&load%5B%5D=-models,wp-plupload,media-views,media-editor,word-count,editor,jquery-ui-resizable,jquery-ui-draggable,jquery-ui-button,jquery-u
&load%5B%5D=i-position,jquery-ui-dialog,wpdialogs,wplink,wpdialogs-popup,wp-fullscreen,media-upload&ver=3.5.1

532 chars.

Do you guys plan to shorten this somehow in the future?

I also notice that there is another area where the querystring goes wild,
and that is when you want to apply a bulk action on comments on the admin
panel by selecting all comments and pressing one of the FILTERS such as
"show all comment type". This action results me a URL with 1388 chars after
the "?" which is another no go for me.

I guess as we rely more and more on the querystring, some people will be
running into issues due to their server configurations.

Maybe the comments URL ( the edit-comments.php file ) can be fixed to work
with a POST method as opposed to the GET method but, the other one, the
load_scripts.php is a more difficult one to deal with.

Thank you all.

_print_scripts does not currently have a way to split these, but it is possible.

However, 532 is not a particularly long query string. Information I
can find suggests that a realistic limit for the total URL length
would be 2k, because IE has problems with URLs longer than 2048
characters. If you want to be safe, 1024 characters would be max.

IIS's default URL limit is 16,384 characters.

I realize now that I did not use the best wording.
I had in mind was if Yoast is using the best practice?

Thank you Otto for shining light on that matter.

Subject: [wp-hackers] get_header hook runs twice for me.
Message-ID: <CAHERW=0fFi2M0UU4HAnDiNNA9R6-uH-+wgfnrA9W12BGSG0UMQ@mail.gmail.com>

I got this

add_action('get_header','get_context');
function get_context()
{
global $wp_query;
print_r($wp_query);
echo "<hr>HALUK<hr>";
}


When I go visit an archive a page, I see that the get_context runs twice. I
know it runs twice because I see my name repeated twice in between the
<hr>s.
Anyway, in the first run, I get the wp_query output in a ,very limited and
useless fashion. It's limited and got no data in it, something like this;

WP_Query Object
(
    [query] =>
    [query_vars] => Array
        (
        )

    [tax_query] =>
    [meta_query] =>
    [queried_object] =>
    [queried_object_id] =>
    [request] =>
    [posts] =>
    [post_count] => 0
    [current_post] => -1
    [in_the_loop] =>
    [post] =>
    [comments] =>
    [comment_count] => 0
    [current_comment] => -1
    [comment] =>
    [found_posts] => 0
    [max_num_pages] => 0
    [max_num_comment_pages] => 0
    [is_single] =>
    ... some more is_this and is_that... cut for brevity.
    [is_posts_page] =>
    [is_post_type_archive] =>
    [query_vars_hash] =>
    [query_vars_changed] => 1
    [thumbnails_cached] =>
)

As you see even the found_posts comes up as 0.

In the second running though, I I get all the context one can wish for in
regards to the current page.
Including the correctly calculated [found_posts] data.

Why is that? Why am I getting this action hook runs twice?

Some themes call get_header() more than once. Accidentally, of course,
usually by a bad copy-paste or when the theme is hacked together. Core does
a require_once in this situation, which means no obvious change, making
this tough to spot. However, the action hook would fire both times.

Check your theme. Try this on any default theme (Twenty Ten through
Thirteen) and you aren't likely to see this issue.
