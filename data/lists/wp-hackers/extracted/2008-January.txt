Heh. Thanks for this. I've just replaced static texts with this function
call and deleted that annually-recurring reminder from my diary. :-)

Happy Festi... errr... new year! My new year's resolution is 3840x1440.

Folks,

Copyrights do not change just because the year changes. New posts in 
2008 should have a 2008 copyright. Old posts and pages should have the 
copyright of whenever they're created.

Message-ID: <5cdeb9b20801010614h622f9cb6hac2368f8027ee8e7@mail.gmail.com>

Hey there,

do you know who is in charge of responding to requests for adding
extra plugins to the repository? I sent in a request at least 3 days
ago and it still hasn't been answered. (Plus, my plugin just went from
0.1 to 0.2 ;-))

Thanks

Steph

Matt M does it I believe.  It sometimes takes up to a couple of weeks.

Copyright is not the date of creation, it is the date of "publication" [1].
Many works get their copyright renewed with each new republication (see much
of Disney's material).

Arguably, a WP page is "published" each time it is generated for the user.
But this has not been legally tested and such display could be considered
simply "public performance" (see [1], and the section "publication").

So using a dynamically presented copyright date seems completely
appropriate.  However, if you read [1] further, you'll see that printing a
date of copyright is optional, so this whole discussion may be moot.

IANAL, YMMV, this is all US-biased, etc., etc.

I'm sorry, but that's not even close to the law. Copyright does not 
reset each time a CD is burned or a book printed. Nor does it reset each 
time a web page is sent from a server to a browser.

Disney's works are not renewed with each rerelease. New material, not 
previously published, may be newly copyrighted with a new release. Old 
material still has its original date of publication. Disney has spent 
big dollars bribing Congress to extend the term of copyright protection 
because of this. otherwise a lot of the early Disney material would now 
be in the public domain.

Gee, Rusty, I would suggest you read the document I referenced.  It
specifically discusses what constitutes publication.  Note that "server" and
"browser" are not mentioned. :)

This is not settled law, and as I noted, printing a date is optional.
However, deposit is, and I doubt anyone here is meeting that requirement.
So most of this makes this whole discussion moot, or at least fodder for
$1000/hour legal teams, not you and I.

Irrelevant, and I'm sorry but you are still wrong one every level. I 
hate to be a nag, but I really don't want to see still more fictions 
about copyright law get propagated. The basic requirements of copyright 
law are actually not all that complex, and are certainly within the 
reach of subscribers to this mailing list, provided that they don't 
listen to myth, superstition, and misinformation.

It is indeed settled law. There is absolutely nothing in copyright law 
that in any way suggests that mere republication in any form or medium, 
online or off, resets the copyright date.

Furthermore, if you read the document you referenced, you would notice 
that deposit is *NOT* required to maintain one's copyrights. It used to 
be but that hasn't been true for decades now. This is another popular 
superstition about copyright law.

There are some unsettled areas in copyright law, but these just aren't them.

I strongly recommend that people not listen to either Rusty or me, but read
the appropriate documents ([1] and/or the appropriate ones for your
jurisdiction), hire qualified legal counsel if this really concerns them,
and draw conclusions appropriate to their situation.

Note that in the US, anything that is published is automatically copyrighted

have to explicitly say it's in the public domain.  Otherwise, it's 
copyrighted, notice or no notice.

I put the notice on my pages just to help keep stupid people from copying my

Actually, it's upon completion, not publication.

I'd like to propose a reasonable-sounding solution so that everyone  
stops arguing and we enjoy 2008:

Anything that anyone creates is copyrightable, and indeed, as soon as  
something is created, the creator owns the copyrights to that entity.

It would then be a reasonable jump to assume that a copyright date is  
actually a span of dates-- from the time the first letter of a work is  
put down, to the time the last letter is put down. This is likely why  
copyright dates are always shown as years: it gets very messy to do  
otherwise.

Let's consider a blog a work as a whole, a work that is always in  
development. It would stand to reason that, while each post on a blog  
has its own individual copyright date, the work as a whole has a  
copyright date that ranges from the starting copyright date of the  
first post, to the ending copyright date of the last post. Thus, for a  
blog I started in 2005, I would use a copyright message of "Copyright  
(C) 2005 - 2008 Matt Patenaude," provided that I had made a post in  
2008. Technically, until I make that first post of 2008, the copyright  
date should stay at 2007.

I'd suggest that this is where the convention comes from: since the  
blog as a whole is a work that is still in development in the present  
year, when it becomes a new year, it's perfectly acceptable to move  
the copyright date forward. If the blog were no longer maintained,  
this would of course be inappropriate, but as "creation" is still  
occurring, the copyright date is not finalized.

IANAL, but I believe that that ^^ would stand up in court.

Now, let's stop fighting. :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Cut Off Point for adding Documentation and
	enhancements to 2.4
Message-ID: <477B4533.9000706@santosj.name>

I plan on working on the documentation up to the day the next semester 
starts again, which is the 14th or 15th. I would like to finish 3 or 4 
files as well as some old files I've been sitting on, which should be 
done by the end of this weekend. However, I would like to know what 
would be the cut off point for adding new documentation and enhancements 
that will be able to get into 2.4.

On the topic of Documentation, I would like to create a ticket just for 
fixing documentation errors that wouldn't justify opening a completed 
ticket just to fix a character or line here and there. I think it should 
encompass all files, instead of just individual ones. I can have a patch 
that correct some documentation in functions.php and plugins.php. Its 
been driving me crazy thinking about it, but I can't justify reopening 
the same ticket. I would propose that the ticket stay open for future 
documentation fixes and referenced from the inline documentation codex 
page. If such a ticket were created, would it be closed as invalid or 
won't fix and kept open?

I also have some tickets I've shown some love towards that I would like 
to get in to 2.4. Well, actually just one, the other one isn't ready.

Since these are non-functional source lines, I'm fine with adding them
until pretty late.

Also, today's IRC dev meetup will address the release cycle.  The
holidays really slowed us down.  So, you might have some extra time.

I'd consider having one such ticket per release since trac doesn't do
the multi-milestone thing.  I'm cool with either way, but some of the
trac gardeners might prefer new tickets per incident.

Add a comment to bump them to the top, and I'll take a look.

Is there any form of estimation on when the new admin UI redesign is going to be fully commited? 
Less than a month until when 2.4 is supposed to be shipping AFAIK(btw, was that changed in the meeting?) and still nothing.

I'm personally wanting to update a few plugins admin interfaces to look more 2.4'ised for when its released, but i've got no clue as to how things will look other than the general colour scheme.

Subject: [wp-hackers] 2.4/2.5 release
Message-ID: <477C2C85.4030700@mullenweg.com>

In light of the big changes happening in the codebase and admin section, 
we're going to push back the next release to be aimed for early March.

This is the timeframe when 2.5 was originally schedule for, so we're 
treating the originally planned 2.4 in December as a skipped release, as 
a result of both the holidays and the large changes which we weren't 
able to start on until late October.

There's some good stuff in the oven, and we don't want to rush it.

This means that all phpdoc @since version numbers that have 2.4 will 
have to be set to 2.5. That is good to know.

So does this mean that all the bugs pushed to 2.5 are going to have to be
fixed now?

It just means that bugs filed for 2.4 can be pushed to 2.5 when updating the tickets, And anything remaining in the 2.5 milestone come closer to release time get pushed to 2.6.
nothing "has to be" fixed in any release (Allthough idealy most would love for all the tickets to be fixed for each milestone)

This is sweet! However, could it be possible to switch places with the 
image-up-loader? IMHO, tags should be closer to the write post window 
than the image-up-loader... Besides, tag field WAS right under the write 
post window before... this might confuse people... =P

great, Can not stop loving sweet Wordpress.

Can we have this form size bit longer for "tags_input" instead of 40 as it
looks too small under the blue color tag div on my browser.

On second note can we quickly add the color styling soon as well.

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/139655

I did what I could to make it work for me but I have strong feeling
something is no right in my implementation  as colors are not coming as
expected or passed from tags.php template file.

-Thanks

Who is Rob1n?

Who is m0n5t3r?

They both seem to be awesome people, so I'm sure someone knows the answer.

Couldn't agree more. Better off taking your time doing things well (w/ 
o losing track of "the market's expectations") than rushing off  
something you're not comfortable with.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Contributing Patches to WordPress
Message-ID: <1199382397.6694.4.camel@jon-ubuntu>

Hi,
I'd like to start contributing to WordPress development, but the Wiki
page is a little confusing. I have a checkout of the latest SVN on my
computer. So when I want to change something, I go and edit the file.
How do I contribute my change to the SVN from here? I know I need to
patch the file, but no information is given on what patch format, how to
post a patch, etc.

Thanks.
Hans

Welcome to WordPress hacking, Hans!

The basic answer to your question is that you upload the patch to a
WordPress trac ticket here: http://trac.wordpress.org/

At the bottom of that page you'll see links to tips on how to create
patches using SVN tools.

If you could please, can you update this patch for the current state of 
SVN revision? I just tried this on the localhost copy, using current SVN 
trunk version. I wasn't sure what revision number to use, but mainly was 
trying to see how this patch worked over-all code wise...
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4360
http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/4360/4360.diff

Here's what I got so far:

a) Options don't "stick". I selected to use just commenter name, and hit 
update options button. It's not sticking, the check mark isn't "in" the 
check box after hitting update options... resulting in b)
b) After submitting the comment, I get following error message: "Error: 
please enter a valid email address."
c) In wp-comments.post.php file..

this line needs to changed from:
wp_die( __( 'Error: please complete the URL field.' );

to (get rid of syntax error or whatever):
wp_die( __( 'Error: please complete the URL field.' ) );

Sorry for the delay, your plugin is now up to date.  I think we have  
found the problem that was causing plugins not to update so hopefully  
it will not happen again.

It's not anywhere near done.  post-new will have a very different look
once complete.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP_Object_Cache and integration with bbPress
Message-ID: <20D60255-F481-4D2E-9076-7328A09ED08C@turbonet.com>

I'm looking to integrate WordPress' object cache with bbPress'.  With  
an common object cache mechanism, sites that load bbPress and  
WordPress on the same page view would gain a bit in efficiency, any  
persistent cache would be kept smaller, developers would only have to  
learn/write one kind of cache system, and site owners would be able to  
use the same object cache plugins (e.g. the memcache or APC plugins)  
for bbPress, WordPress, or both.

So, if you have a site with a WordPress install and a bbPress install  
both talking to the same memcached server (for example), we have to  
make sure bbPress doesn't poison WordPress' data or vice versa.   
That's easy, though.  We just have WordPress and bbPress store data in  
different cache groups:

WordPress posts: wp_cache_get( $post_id, 'posts' );
bbPress posts:   wp_cache_get( $bb_post_id, 'bb_posts' );


What about users though?

Some sites (I think most sites) will have a unified user base for  
their WordPress and bbPress installs.  Let's take WordPress.com as an  
example.  There, WordPress mu and bbPress share the same users table.   
Since it's the same data, it'd be silly to cache it all twice like the  
following would do:

WordPress user: wp_cache_get( $user_id, 'users' );
bbPress user:   wp_cache_get( $user_id, 'bb_users' );

So for the specific case of user data, it makes since to store them in  
the same place:

WordPress user: wp_cache_get( $user_id, 'users' );
bbPress user:   wp_cache_get( $user_id, 'users' );


But other sites (I think only a few sites) will *not* have a unified  
user base for their WordPress and bbPress installs.  Let's take  
WordPress.org as an example.  There, WordPress and bbPress do not  
share the same user table.  Since it's different data, we have to  
store it in different places.


So.  My suggestion is for WordPress and bbPress to use different cache  
groups for their respective users.

WordPress user: wp_cache_get( $user_id, 'users' );
bbPress user:   wp_cache_get( $user_id, 'bb_users' );

But to have the cache mechanism consider those two groups as  
synonymous;  wp_cache_get() would be written to look in the same place  
(and therefore return the same result) in either of the above cases.   
(Actually, wp_cache_get() wouldn't have a clue.   
WP_Object_Cache::get() would do the work.)

So we'd have something like:

class WP_Object_Cache {
	var $group_translations = array( 'bb_users' => 'users' );

	function get( $key, $group ) {
		if ( isset($this->group_translations[$group]) )
			$group = this->group_translations[$group];

		...
	}
}

By default, then, the object cache would assume that WordPress' and  
bbPress' user bases were unified.  If that weren't true for your  
particular set up, you'd write some small plugin that would modify the  
translation table (or write a complete new object cache, I suppose).

Or core WordPress could have an empty translation table (but  
WP_Object_Cache::get() would still know what to do with a translation  
table), and bbPress would add the necessary bits.

Another option would be to just store user data twice and not care  
about any supposed efficiency loss.

Thoughts?

Wouldn't that be the responsibility of the cache configuration, not you? 
I shouldn't configure two different programs to use the exact same cache 
if they have different data for the same keys. Seems like an edge case.

Should we not switch the caches to use the table names is all places?

Do you not then get integration for free when the table names are the
same.

This could also help avoid clashes between two WordPress blogs using
the same backend.

But configuring the cache is exactly what I'm talking about.

In the case where WordPress and bbPress have a unified user base:
I tell WordPress to grab data labelled "users" from the "users"  
bucket, and I tell bbPress to grab data labelled "bb_users" from that  
same "users" bucket.

In the case where WordPress and bbPress do not have a unified user  
base but do talk to the same memcached server:
I tell WordPress to grab data labelled "users" from the "users"  
bucket, and I tell bbPress to grab data labelled "bb_users" from the  
different "bb_users" bucket.

I agree with you; I think that the later (non-unified user bases but  
the same memcached server) is an edge case.  My proposal assumes the  
former case as its default.  But it still has these different "users"  
and "bb_users" labels so that the edge case can be satisfied.

I neglected to mention another reasonable option in my last email.  To  
differentiate between users and bb_users and to keep the core  
WP_Object_Cache system exactly as it is.  Sites that wanted that extra  
bit of efficiency would then write a custom WP_Object_Cache class to  
translate bb_users => users on their own.

That's a very clever idea :)

It would require core changes in WP in more places than my original  
proposals, but it makes sense to me.

If there's a way to show us little people some screenshot or just some  
diagrams of what will be implemented, I think that some of those  
thread would disappear :-)

I think you did indeed. My plugin just updated itself on the site (been
committed to SVN for quite a while).

I think I prefer the original proposal. It seems simpler and a little  
more predictable.

No they wouldn't, they'd just be replaced by people complaining about
how horrible the new design looks and how the old one was much better.

Cool, Barry. I've finally been able to upload my new plugin, Bunny's
Language Linker. Two weird things, though

a) when I'd just uploaded it, it appeared both in the newest plugins
list and the recently updated one, but the url for it (when you
clicked the name) was http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins//  <-- note
the double // (blank plugin slug?)
b) now, the plugin is reachable at
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bunnys-language-linker/ but it
doesn't show up in the recently added plugins list anymore (nothing
since Jan 2nd?)

Just to note: it does show up in the recently updated plugins.

Those are an inevitability after the changes are committed, though.
This way we get both, which is doubly horrid.

There are many other possible benefits to this. It's something I've

I'm working on a 2007 in review post for the dev blog. What sort of 
statistics would you guys be interested in seeing, especially as 
compared to 2006?

Also, is anyone good at extracting info from Subversion/Trac. I think 
there is some interesting data in there but I'm not sure the best way to

(Hopefully) Perhaps while this whole redesign thing is still happening, 
someone will adjust that issue...It's hard to just "fix it" now, because 
there's so much that needs done yet for it... =/

Short and sweet:
a) Download Tortoise SVN http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads (I'd choose 
installer.) Install it, restart computer if needed.

b) Create folder on desktop called "Trunk"...

c) Right click on it, find "Tortoise SVN menu" then choose first option 
for "create repository here". Once that's done....

d) Right click on folder again, go to "SVN Checkout" button/option... 
Enter for URL of repository: http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/trunk/ 
(I just let "head revision" option ticked.. hit ok.. It will 
automatically SVN check out the TRUNK copy of WordPress... then..

e) Find the files you edited already before, but do it in the SVN copy 
of it. Make your changes again. You should get a red circle with "!" in 
it...

f) On desktop, right click on the Trunk folder again, find the Tortoise 
SVN menu option again, scroll down to "create patch"... The files you 
just edited should be listed there with check marks in it.. hit OK.

g) Create a name for your .diff or .patch file, save it to desktop... Done.

I think that's all you need to know...?  =/

Can we leave all these till matt has actually finished with the redesign
please.  Otherwise they will just clutter up trac.

Deleted the image file being used as the background and restored from
SVN -- seems fixed.

another suggestion for the suggest feature. maybe you should add delay:
500 and minchars:3 to the jquery.suggest method call (second
parameter). you will avoid unnecessary ajax requests if the user is
still typing.

jQuery('#newtag').suggest( 'admin-ajax.php?action=ajax-tag-search',
{ onSelect: tag_flush_to_text, delay: 500, minchars: 2 } );

Subject: [wp-hackers] Contributing Patches to WordPress


Hi,
I'd like to start contributing to WordPress development, but the Wiki
page is a little confusing. I have a checkout of the latest SVN on my
computer. So when I want to change something, I go and edit the file.
How do I contribute my change to the SVN from here? I know I need to
patch the file, but no information is given on what patch format, how to
post a patch, etc.

Thanks.
Hans

If you do a breakdown of RPC blog clients as you've done in the past,  
I would really appreciate seeing it broken down by platform.  I'm not  
sure if this is possible or not. For instance, I don't know if the  
cross-platform clients identify their platform in the user agent. But  
if they do, this would be a useful part of the statistics.

some plugins (twitter tools for example) use this function, but for
the sidebar the generated links are usually too long. it would be nice
if a developer could pass a string that is used as link text.

now:
<a href="http://this.is.a-very-long.url/and/it/needs/too/much/space/in/

then:
<a href="http://this.is.a-very-long.url/and/it/needs/too/much/space/in/

what do you think, good/bad idea?

How can I add something via a plugin to the landing page of WP-Admin?
The first page you see after logging in, I mean.

It is done in YAPB
(http://johannes.jarolim.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/mygallery/yapb-beta-screenshots-1/04.jpg ), and I would really like to do the same thing with my plugin (add information to that page). However, I haven't been able to find the hook for doing this, @ wphooks.flatearth.org or in the YAPB source.

Does anyone know how to implement this in a plugin?

Thanks,
Hans

I think you're looking for activity_box_end.

 add_action('activity_box_end', 'your_plugin_function');

Hope this helps.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Mass Select Users For Editing (#5592)
Message-ID: <a5a37a5b-33ff-4359-aa0d-6b7be310bd16@q39g2000hsf.googlegroups.com>

I noticed that you can't check a checkbox and select all users in a
similar way to mass editing comments/links. I went about creating
this. The file contains a new JS function for the user page, I
refactored a JS function, and I edited the UI for the edit users page.
Now, when a user clicks the input checkbox it will select all users in
that specific role for editing (and unchecking as well).

The only thing to note is when a user adds a user the Ajax response
doesn't pass in a class name (which I made the role) which the JS
functions depends on. So if a user adds a user and then tries to
select all users under that role then it will omit the one user from
the Ajax response. I tried editing admin-ajax, but I am so sick of
working on this I hope someone else can do it.

Can we keep overly complex code out of the source when it does not need 
to be?

I've noticed while loops that should be foreach loops (fixed). I've just 
seen code that tests whether a variable is an array without using 
is_array() (will be fixed in patch when finished).

Yes, you have proven that you are awesome, but you don't need to prove 
it. Now for the love of all that is holy please stop. Overly complex 
code when it does not need to be does not help people decipher your code.

Thank You.

Woah there, the only one that's awesome is me. Anyone else is just a 
"wanna-be"... now that we have that cleared up, I'm going back to proxy

I'm pretty sure (well, I hope this is the case) that this was all part of
the "2 am syndrome" -- looking at jumbled code so long it starts to make
sense. It may be a good idea to enforce peer review for big patches, much
like how the Webkit (and others) project does it, so the chance of these
weird pieces of code can be caught and ironed out. I often can't find
mistakes in my code, but it takes only a few seconds for others to find
simple mistakes.

Perhaps. I do agree that having someone else look over your code is a 
great way to find obvious mistakes.

There aren't too many places that I've seen where there is a "WTF?" 
moment. Digging through patches for me, is whether said patch would make 
my life as a plugin writer easier or harder. If it is the latter, then 
you'll know I'll be kicking and screaming about its inclusion.

I usually write overly complex code while I'm not tired and usually 
don't realize it until I go to fix a mistake. The problem with the 
referenced logic is that it is confusing based on the precedence. 
However, I first read the '=' as '==' as that is what I expect to see in 
an IF expression. Looking at it, I immediately questioned, "WTF? Does 
this check to see if the variable is an array? BY TYPECASTING!!!! 
Nooooo!" If you can write code like that at 2am, then I bow to you oh 
great one! Seriously, it is l33t code, but it is not needed because 
is_array() exists for the purpose of checking if something is an array 
and you won't confuse people who don't know about type casting.

Still working on the patch however. There are a lot of foreach arrays 
and not all of them need to be type casted to an array.

Peer reviews would be good for already existing code, well for any code. 
I do think that peer reviews are more for obvious bug issues and "WTF?" 
moments. For myself personally, I think the foreach issue should be 
fixed by first evaluating whether the variable is an array using 
is_array() before starting the array, but that is just me. I'm unsure if 
you type cast if the foreach will silently fail if it sees that the 
count is 0 as it would be if you type cast something that isn't an 
array, "What, there aren't any elements in this array. Failure!" I've 
never had a chance to test my theory however. I do assume that if you 
type cast something that it will at least run the loop once, but again 
I've never had the opportunity to test my theory. Sanity checks are 
always good however.

Oh yeah. The first reference was a for loop and not a foreach (had 
foreach on my mind). Did you know that in C#, you are not allowed to 
manipulate the array you are traversing? Wild. Did you know that in PHP 
you are technically not supposed to manipulate the array you are 
traversing in a foreach loop, but PHP will not crash and burn like C# 
will? Good stuff to keep in mind.

Hmm, I'm one of the haterz about the total tickets and about the ones 
that have patches aren't committed.

I think stats on milestones and how many tickets were fixed in each 
milestone verses how long the milestone was held open for (meaning it 
was the trunk version as well as the ones in the branches).

Yeah, the thing is though... that's fine and dandy. People will see/say, 
"gee willikers... this many tickets were found/fixed... but look at the 
huge amount that was pushed over to the next future version but once 
again!"

Example, stuff like this are but a coin toss on what-to-do with it...

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5220

a) (choose what's best, via a "vote") then commit it..
b) (rather then constantly bump it) just flush (delete) it

Uh, not really THAT complicated... last I knew, stuff like those tickets 
won't affect the Admin redesign either... But ah well, let's keep 
kicking it forward... who knows, maybe by the year 2020 it will get some 
love... Let's flip a coin.. head = keep / tails = heap...

Code is kinda already peer reviewed, isn't it? I mean, in Trac, when you
submit a patch, there's usually a "+1" or "-1", which is kind of the
same thing, isn't it?

Good point, and props for the rewrite.

IMHO though, this isn't the result of a conscious effort on any coder's
behalf to show-off so much as it is part of the human psychology.

Jeff Atwood has a pretty to-the-point article on that [1], which, I think,
says it all.

Highly recommended, with English translation.

By the way, Drupal's founder gave WordPress decent recognition some days
ago. I can find and post the URL if you've missed it.

that can be documented, but everything beyond that is a coin toss. Well, 
I also want to get all of the short descriptions and parameter/return 
descriptions done first.

Is there anyone else that wishes to continue the effort after the 13th? 
I have general phpdoc templates for 99% of the functions in wp-includes, 
you just fill in the information. The templates won't be committed until 
they have more information, the core team seems to like committing the 
documentation if it has short descriptions, as well as parameter 
description and return types and descriptions. Committing the templates 
as they are now would be ugly.

If at the very least, I should have time to pick the effort back up in 
the summer. Dude! I'm going to graduate this semester!

Thanks, I very much enjoyed the past four months!

I just wanted to apologize to everyone on the list about my overly harsh 
sarcasm, being pushy, and my general tone lately. I just have to keep in 
mind, that, there's a huge amount of bigger and more important 
things/tickets needing committed to SVN/Trunk, and not just the minor 
Tickets. Again, I give my apologizes to everyone.  Generally I'm just a 
little sarcastic on here... but not in a bad way. But lately I've been 
overboard on the sarcasm and being harsh with it. And I apologize for 
it. Okay.. now I'm going back to my online duties.. =)

I'm trying to display only top level pages AND pages that are either 
children of the current page, or children of the ancestors of the 
current page.  So, if I have a page structure like this:

On the main page, I'd like to display all the top level pages: A, B, C, 
D, E, F

On page 'A' I would like to display:
A
 > R
 > S
 > T
B
C
D
E
F

On page 'R' I would like to display:
A

Basically, it would be like an expanding tree, but it would not use 
javascript, it would simply build the menu based on the current page.  
It seems like this would be a common desire.  Is there something like 
this out there, or some simple way of doing it?

Another option for this is to use CSS to hide the current of the non- 
current parent.  I have included a snippet of CSS code which would  
need to be expanded for your deeper tree:

#sidebar ul li ul {
     display: none;
}

#sidebar ul li.current_page_parent ul {
     display: block;
}

#sidebar ul li.current_page_item ul {
     display: block;
}

Subject: [wp-hackers] Pre-upgrade and post upgrade hooks
Message-ID: <51156.70.255.20.108.1199775079.squirrel@webmail.santosj.name>

I've written a couple of patches for adding the pre-upgrade and post
upgrade hooks [1]. However, I'm unsure what the requirements are for
inclusion into the core.

My personal goal is so that adding the hooks does not prevent nor break
the upgrade process for the user. Some tests were not comforting in this
regard.

The issue I have is that if a plugin breaks, it is most likely not going
to be during the upgrade or pre-upgrade stage. Therefore the protection is
not exactly needed. If a plugin is poorly written it will fail the entire
WordPress execution anyway.

Also, there are checks before activating a plugin that make sure that the
plugin works.

The way I can see around it is having a hidden second and fourth upgrade
step in between the upgrade third step.

1. User clicks on upgrade link.
2. Active Plugins are sandboxed and called one after the other with their
preupgrade hook. The results are saved and serialized in the session or
cookie. (Accept only bool and null values)
3. Run Upgrade.
4. Run Post Upgrade hook with sandboxed plugins and give the post-upgrade
hooks the value returned from the pre-upgrade hook.
5. Display Finished status.

With the current plugins, there is only three steps.

1. User clicks on the upgrade link.
2. Pre-upgrade hook is called and results stored. Upgrade is performed.
Post Upgrade hook is called with results from pre-upgrade passed to the
post upgrade plugin hook.
3. Finished page is displayed.

The current implement is far easier than the one I would feel happy with,
but will most likely not implement.

The question is probably should be trust plugin authors to do the right
thing and not try to screw with us during the upgrade process? Or does
possible hacker advantage trump the inclusion to core?

I would very much like to see the ticket inclusion as well as the
pre-activation hook [2] (without the plugin_data filter).

To me that sounds like a good idea, and easily implemented, on #2, and #4 it should be possible to sequentially include each plugin until one fails, at which point, it redirects back to itself and continues on with the next plugin.

My only other thought is, Is it worth it?
Think about it, unless the plugin is upgraded before WP is upgraded, then the plugin will most likely not know of anything it needs to be modified(eg, insert pages elsewhere or something).
I guess it could be setup so that the activation hook is called (as some plugins check for compatibility then) upon the upgrade.

I DO think that after an upgrade is run, plugins should be sandboxed, and sequentially activated, and de-activating those which cause an error to be thrown -- at least this would prevent the entire admin going down, And doesnt require plugin authors to do anything extra to allow this process to happen.

Unless an error occurs, it would be transparent to the user, if a plugin had to be deactivated, then showing it on the final screen(Along with a check to see if theres an updated version available) would be the cleanest method. Perhaps after the upgrade is completed, WP should check for ANY plugin having a newer version and reminding the user at that stage that they need to be upgraded?

I apologise if any of this is just pure ramble :) - Feel free to quote any of that on the trac tickets (I'll reframe from commenting there for now though)

I think the main issue is working out how to sandbox them. I'd 
personally be in favour of having an external PHP file, which loads the 
specified plugin and nothing else. We then run `file_get_contents` to 
get each one and check if the output is empty. If not, we deactivate it 
and add a notice to the page.

I personally see no flaw :)
Thanks,
Ryan.

I was thinking similar to the current admin activation method.
* Set redirection or flag in session(I'm unsure if the session data gets saved if a fatal error occurs?) for failed load
* Include plugin
* Change redirection or flag to show plugin loaded correctly.
* Repeat with next plugin

It could even be done inline, via javascript using ajax calls..
Checking plugins (1/12)
Notice: There is an updated version of "Plugin Name"(abc.php) available, [link]Download 1.8 here[/link]
Checking plugins (2/12)
Checking plugins (3/12)
Error: "My Plugin"(xyz.php) has failed to load cleanly, Plugin has been deactivated.
Checking plugins (4/12)
Error: "My 2nd Plugin"(z.php) has failed to load cleanly, Plugin has been deactivated. [bold]An updated version is available, [link]Download 1.8 now[/link][/bold]"
...
(Of course, it would be nicer for the number to change and the errors/notices to be listed underneath)

Main problem i see with that method would be that idealy you need to load all of WP's files to ensure that it does load correctly(I'm not sure if the admin console currently includes all WP files atm(such as those for templating and whatnot) either), and on slower hosts it could cause slower upgrades.
Theres also the issue of those who do not use a browser to do the upgrade and instead use wget to automatically do it after the svnup

Well, as to why I'm working on the ticket. It is because I can and I 
find the problem both slightly complicated and interesting. Besides the 
pre-activation hook, I would love to have this in the core, because of 
the possible ideas and solutions I could create if it was in core.

Well, that is one of the problems, is that only a fraction of the 
WordPress library is included. I would have to say, that it would be fun 
to build an auto-upgrader into the plugin using the hooks. I could first 
check to see if there is an upgrade available in the pre-upgrade and 
then in the post upgrade I could download (if possible) and upgrade 
myself. Forget WordPress or the user doing it.

It appears that the more difficult solution is the acceptable approach 
to the ticket's resolution. I'll try to work out a patch that replicates 
the sandbox, by most likely using the existing sandbox code.

I'm unsure that displaying feedback is needed. I would like to offer it 
if something failed, but if everything is working fine, then people are 
used to a screen that gives them almost no relevant information. I would 
like to keep it that way when there are no problems.

Sessions are just files on the server and are updated whenever you start 
the session and update the contents. I've die() after updating session 
data and everything was fine.

Message-ID: <e9f3ce460801080710i9b7204fyc085fc41f25ba166@mail.gmail.com>

Currently programming a plugin and can't for the life of me work out
the reason my foreign characters aren't displaying right.

In my header I have the following <meta http-equiv="content-type"
content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> . The capital e accute
characters turn out as ? , not rendering correctly at all.

In the MySQL database, the collation is set to utf8_unicode_ci on all
of the table and all of the fields for the plugin. Now that is...I
just changed these over use phpmyadmin from latin1_swedish_ci to
utf8_unicode_ci because I thought this would mean my ? characters
would turn out correctly. This didn't solve the problem at all.

I have numerous functions that take cells from the database and sticks
them in bits of the plugin output. However, it never works, until I
use Safari to change the text encoding to Western (ISO Latin 1). The
page re-renders then it shows the characters right.

I don't know what to do and I am considering hurling computers out of windows...

More simple question, very much secondary: what filter other than
wp_textualize convert new lines and various spacings into HTML, adding
p and br tags - as is done with all posts...

Any help would be hugely, hugely appreciated.

Thanks a lot

check the charset in the wordpress settings, and/or the PHP locale setting.

I remember that it was wpautop messing things up most of the time, but
things might have changed since I touched Wordpress the last time.

Dunno if this will help. I've had reports of similar issues with 
aStickyPostOrderER from a user using it on a Hebrew language blog where 
category names would turn up with those evilly acusing question marks.

The user the then reported that he'd fixed it by adding:
`mysql_query(?SET NAMES ?utf8??);`
before every original mysql_query call.

I've not had a chance to look at it yet, perhaps someone more clued up 
can enlighten us on what's the cause and best practices etc...?

Maybe off-topic, but I've had quite a few run-ins with PHP/MySQL/WP
encoding problems.

If your tables are UTF-8, make sure the following is in wp-config.php.
 This will cause SET NAMES to be called.

define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8');

That did the trick. Dreamhost doesn't update the wp-config.php file
every newer version of Wordpress (obviously), so it had none of this
stuff in there.

Nice one.

So it sounds like it might be a one-click-install specific issue - if so 
is there another way to protect against this i.e. without telling users 
to go edit wp-config.php?

I'm not sure, but you might want to have this discussion on the 
wp-hackers list? Very seldom do they carry on discussions on the wp-svn

Message-ID: <F8E609C4-8C77-4471-BFFE-65DB2B9C29CD@yellowswordfish.com>

I am hoping someone might be able to suggest a workaround for the  
above problem I raised a while  back. In short, sometime after 2.1.3,  
'the_title' filter was added to wp_list_pages(). The result is that if  
you run a filter on 'the_title' to change the title of a specific page  
and wp_list_pages() is being used (on a navbar or sidebar) then ALL  
page titles get changed.

Testing in the filter to confirm that the current page being displayed  
is the one you want to modify so that your code runs will, of course,  
test positive for every call to the filter - hence all page titles get  
corrupted.

Can anyone think of a way that I can isolate the one page I need to  
change and make the change without effecting all other page listings?  
Sure be grateful for any suggestions...

Thanks

Apologies if I'm misunderstanding, but can you not filter based on the
existing title?

function foo_the_title( $title ) {
    if ( 'About' == $title ) {
        return 'New Title';
    }
    return $title;
}
add_filter('the_title', 'foo_the_title');

Hi Rob
Oh yes - that works OK and is my fallback. In this instance I do not  
know the title - but I do know the page ID so I can run a query to  
retrieve the title. It works but it's a bit of a hammer to crack the  
proverbial nut. I can at least run the query just once so that it  
doesn't get called for each page when wp_list_pages() executes but  
it's not ideal. I still can't fathom the rationale behind calling the  
filter in the template tag in the first place.
So yes - as I say, it's my fallback - I was just hoping there may be a  
quicker method.
Thanks for the response.
Andy

How about something like:

function filter_current_page_title( $title) {
	if (is_page( $title) ) {
		return "new title";
	}
}
add_filter('the_title', 'filter_current_page_title');

I am still pretty new to WP, so take it with a grain of salt...

That plugin does this:

remove_filter('pre_user_description', 'wp_filter_kses');

Removing kses is not so good for security.  This would be better.

remove_filter('pre_user_description', 'wp_filter_kses');
add_filter('pre_user_description', 'wp_filter_post_kses');

Maybe we should have wp_filter_textarea_kses that allows more tags.
Not sure why <p> is not allowed in wp_filter_kses().

There are two arrays in kses.php that list the allowed tags for
wp_filter_kses and wp_filter_post_kses. I would add the p element to
the $allowedtags array. Actually it is there but commented out. I
don't know why.

Plugins can modify those global arrays. It is also possible to use
wp_kses() to supply your own set of allowed tags. All in kses.php.

Sorry if you already got this but I am not sure that the first one  
made it through.

How about something like:

function filter_current_page_title( $title) {
	if (is_page( $title) ) {
		return "new title";
	}
}
add_filter('the_title', 'filter_current_page_title');

I am still pretty new to WP, so take it with a grain of salt...

Sorry yes - I got side-tracked!
Again - similar solution to the one Rob suggested (although I didn't  
know you could use is_page() like that) with the same caveat - I have  
to run a query to get the page title. But thanks for the response. All  
suggestions welcome!

Actually, you can't. is_page() returns true if you are viewing a Page. 
  It doesn't take an argument of a random title and return true if it 
happens to be the title of a page.

I think is_page() takes a page id, page slug or page title as arg and 
will accept an array of these in 2.5:

It was considered, I believe, but in the end the WordPress development team
decided on jQuery. It's a lot more lightweight, IMO, and it also uses the
chain syntax, which while it may take a bit to get used to, is very, very
convenient.

The way jQuery selects DOM elements with CSS syntax is amazing.

I'd say, set `html { background-color: color; }` to fix that.

Besides, "a lot of graphical amazing possibilities" are available from using
the interface[1] library for jQuery. Anin important point to mention is that
jQuery is quite happy to run at the same time as other libraries, prototype
for example.

wp_filter_kses is used on comments, titles, etc. All the stuff where
you don't want that sort of thing. While I don't see anything that
they could do with <p>, I don't see any reason for them to have it in
the first place, really, since the <p>'s are going to be added via
wpautop.

wp_post_filter_kses would be acceptable on the bio information, probably.

It's not spacing. The page isn't large enough to force the footer to the 
bottom. You can either set the footer as static and have it always 
appear at the bottom of the screen, on top of everything, or you can set 
the background colour so that it looks consistant.

Thanks,
Ryan.

I'd rather it be static or kept at the bottom, rather then just adding a 
background color. If I had more time here, I'd work on it myself, but I 
can't. I basically threw this out to get the "higher ups" attention in 
hopes of them maybe fixing it while doing the redesign itself. IF I get 
some time here soon, I'll work at it then. Or, unless *cough* Jeremy 
Visser wouldn't mind handling lmao. :P Anyway, I have to get back to my 
"stuff" here.

Message-ID: <b3ac26c20801092018r25a54208ge6ebe822499b4555@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

The hooks documentation at the codex and at flatearth is nice, but
incomplete. While they give brief explanations of what each hook does,
these sources do not generally tell us which version of WP introduced
a hook, whether it is deprecated, and where in WP's code to find the
hook applied.

Enter the WP hooks database. Check it out and let me know what you
think. (You can click the "feedback appreciated" link at the bottom of
the page rather than swamp people's inboxes with emails.) My database
does not explain what each hook does--we've got the codex and
flatearth for that--but I think you'll find it useful if you do much
work with plugins. The URL is...

http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks

Enjoy.

That is very cool, but why not contact Mark Jaquith (the maintainer of
wphooks.flatearth.org if I remember correctly) and volunteer to

I did try to contact and volunteer some time ago but I never had a  
reply, so I used my spare time to do something different, like trying  
to get back Gengo to life...  Didn't know that flatearth was Mark  
Jaquith's playground, maybe I'll retry soon :-)

Looks useful!

As a perennial reminder, when you create a resource like this, please 
be sure to link it to appropriate pages in the Codex, so that others 
searching for documentation in the official source can find your 
resource. I have added this one to a few spots (Plugin Resources, 
Action Reference, and Filter Reference).

Thanks,

But note that that doesn't currently happen - it's impossible to have  
paragraphs in a bio without using a plugin.

That was a great idea, but not all ancestors are marked. After thinking 
about it for a bit, I just made a little plugin to label the ancestors 
like I needed. <http://xavisys.com/wordpress-mark-parent-pages-plugin/> 
Maybe it'll help someone else along the way.

Responding to Jeremy and Pixline:

Flatearth appears all but abandoned. Besides, my purpose was to
automate this rather than rely on manual documentation. Towards that
end, I made a couple major changes to the site today. It now scrapes
the WP codex to provide descriptions for over 380 hooks. It also uses
a simple algorithm to give a list of related hooks for each hook in
the database. (To see these changes, you need to be viewing the entry
for a single hook--you won't see them if you're looking at a list of
hooks for a particular version.)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Creating objects within a plug-in
Message-ID: <9842763B-3228-4A80-93AA-AF6DE59805DB@gmail.com>

I am developing a plug-in that will allow archive links and pages to  
be easily filtered to exclude or include specific categories. It  
consists of a filter class that encapsulates the functionality of  
wp_get_archives() with the additional subqueries to limit the  
returned posts to the specified categories.

Currently, I instantiate various archive filter objects at the  
beginning of the functions.php file. I can then use them on any page  
by declaring the objects as global. I would like to be able to go the  
next step and build an admin screen that will allow a user to  
configure any number of archive filters for use on within templates.  
I am planning on either using the options route or creating my own  
table structure to manage the filter settings.

My question is this. How would a filter object be instantiated that  
could then be used within another PHP file?

Not sure if I understand the question correctly, but perhaps you're 
looking at serializing objects?

The person on the forums is saying that that form is not getting any
response, having already tried it twice.

My view is that if we are going to have some kind of ability to host
and manage a directory of plugins on wordpress.org, then there needs
to be either some way for authors to edit their information as he is
requesting.

Also, we need a contact point. The plugins directory was straight-up
broken for a very long time (is it still broken), and nobody had any
idea who to talk to, how to fix it, etc... If we're going to have the
thing, then it has to be maintained, and there needs to be an avenue
to report problems; an avenue that actually works.

I checked and one request was made Monday and again yesterday. It is
being pursued.

This is a reasonable request and I'm certain it will be considered.

I feel your are crying wolf here. As far as I know each issue has been
resolved in a timely manner. Feel free to log tickets under the
wordpress.org component if you want tracability.

I am still new enough to PHP so I am not familiar with how it  
serializes objects, but that might be it. However, let me see if I  
can walk through the use case a little better in case there is  
another solution.

The user will go to an admin page to setup a specific filter for  
archives. They will specify the options such as the type of archive  
links to display, the categories to include/exclude, etc. She then  
wants to use the filter in a sidebar to display archive links. She  
would then need to edit the sidebar template and include something like:

global $all_filter;
$all_filter->get_filtered_archives();

on the page at the desired location.

Presently she would add the following at the beginning of my  
functions.php, say:

$all_filter = new arch_filter;
$all_filter->opt['type'] ='monthly';
$all_filter->opt['exclude'] = get_cat_ID('News').",".implode(",",  
get_career_categories());
$all_filter->opt['show_post_count'] = true;

I am trying avoid the user having to instantiate the filters in this  
manner and would rather the filters be managed through admin screens.  
So the question is where does the $all_filter object first get  
instantiated once the admin screens have been implemented.

I don't really see it as crying wolf when it was actually broken and
not working for 4 or 5 weeks or so. People uploaded plugins, it didn't
make those plugins available to the public. People asked about it on
the forums, people emailed me, people posted about the site not
working on other forums (I even saw conversations about it on
Facebook). I had no idea where to point them or what to tell them. It
was unclear to me as to the correct place to report problems.

And if he's reporting a problem on Monday and Tuesday and not getting
a response until Friday, then I don't see that as particularly
"timely". I'm aware that there are only so many people and so much
time, but simply notifying him that his request was received would
probably be a good idea. Was this done? Does the thing automatically
notify people that their request has been actually received and/or
read by a human being?

Also, if that http://wordpress.org/report-bugs/ is the official and
only contact point (I'd prefer an email address, like
plugins@wordpress.org, but whatever), then it needs to be more visible
on the website somewhere. I'm aware that the "Report a Site Bug" link
is at the bottom of every screen, but having it made a lot more clear
that that page would be where to go for help with the plugins
directory would be nice.

from my previous exerience, it appears that bug reports do get read, but
replying to them would be so time consuming, that not even a script will
want to do it; also, the bugs reported are eventually fixed (I
complained about a problem with the ideas interface about a year ago,
and now it appears to be fixed ;-))

from here it looks like a combination of understaffing and unwillingness
to accept help from the outside (ashamed with how the code looks? :P),
but I may be wrong.

Sorry, if you want to do a post morten to estiblish what, if anything,
went wrong and how it can be improved, then timeline with references
(URLS) are appreciated.

My guess is that their were multiple issues in that time period that
appear to be one, the issue was being pursued, fixed one or more
times, but unfortunately people weren't kept in the loop.

I don't think it is useful to over-analyzing this one scenario. The
original report was overlooked because it appeared to suggest to an
isolated report of a minor problem. Thanks to your follow up it seems
worth pursuing.

Because of the diversity and quantity of issues even in just this one
area regarding extend/plugins sometimes there is no response  and
depending on the issue it can take longer than a week for a response.

Based on the number of submissions to report-bugs related
extend/plugins and the resolutions of the issues, I think the problems
are getting submitted, identified and resolved OK right now. I agree
it can be improved, but it isn't high on my priorities right now.

I was going to say something about this.  I edited a JS file that
calculates the height of the browser window and adds margin-top to the
footer to position.  It also recaculates if you resize the window.
You can see it www.cccconsortium.com.

Subject: [wp-hackers] odd posts query on 404
Message-ID: <780ACFCE-275F-4C10-9049-97DD524C14DD@gmail.com>



Looking at mysql slow queries, I noticed a lot of queries like the  
following:

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS  test_posts.* FROM test_posts  WHERE 1=1   
AND post_type = 'post' AND (post_status = 'publish' OR post_status =  
'private')  ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 10

That looks perfectly normal, except that it was triggered by request  
for /favicon.ico that returned a 404.

It might not be so much of a problem if I didn't have 350,000 posts,  
or if the mysql query cache wasn't voided because I just updated the  
table, but I'd love to hit the database less, and this seems like a  
good place to start.

Thoughts?

Thank you,

Casey

Subject: [wp-hackers] to_ping query optimization
Message-ID: <CB214311-2D68-4217-ACB9-3D84A46DC4B7@gmail.com>


This query from wp-includes/comment.php pops up regularly in my slow  
query logs:

$trackbacks = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT ID FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE  
CHAR_LENGTH(TRIM(to_ping)) > 7 AND post_status = 'publish'");

It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have 350,000 posts (it's a library  
catalog), but I'm at a lost about how to optimize the query without  
getting rid of the CHAR_LENGTH and TRIM functions. I created an index  
on to_ping, but mysql appears to ignore it because of the calculations.

It works beautifully when written as below, but what am I losing? How  
important is the "CHAR_LENGTH(TRIM(to_ping)) > 7" piece?

$trackbacks = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT ID FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE  
to_ping <> '' AND post_status = 'publish'");

Hey Casey! Your query looks great to my eyes. I would guess that the
existing code was written to avoid selecting rows full of spaces or
shorter than 'http://' (7 chars). It would be more efficient to a) use
your query, and b) make sure the field is empty when all valid pings
have been sent.

Could you create a trac ticket and upload a patch with your changes?

That sounds great. I just hope it's approved by Matt and such. Is there 
any way you can submit a patch for this, or provide the files for this 
or whatever? Here's the ticket url: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5626

The code's currently being worked on and broken up into several plugins 
(rather than the one large one it currently is) and then is planned to 
be released as open source.

I'm DD32 :) (ala Dion)
I hadnt read wp-hackers yet this morning, so havnt noticed this.. 
That linked website's footer doesnt move in Opera though..
my trac comment was just a thought i had last night when looking through some other methods, 
CSS hacks are hard and you can never be sure of what the next version of the browser is going to do (ie. all IE6 CSS hacks for positioning footers ave to be updated to support IE7 now), 
JS on the other hand creates jumping around of items unless you hide them via css until the js has positioned it, unfortunately that means if js isnt available, the footer stays invisible.

D
(Oh, and i've probably got worse typing/spelling/grammar than anyone else)

Dude, I totally forgot about the functions.php for a series on Plugins 
that I'm doing. I'll have to do some research and write an article on it 
also.

 From what I understand from your problem. It appears that you will want 
to use options API instead. Your class can still build your "opt" array 
based off of it. The options API will serialize your array and allow you 
to plug it into your class property as it is. This will allow you to 
build a plugin in your functions.php that will also setup an admin page 
for managing the options.

It appears that any existing functions.php file is included during the 
WordPress bootstrap, so you can include anything in it that you can in a 
plugin.

Just kind of have to make sure that you clean up your options when the 
user removes you. If you name your options well enough, 
'yourthemename_{Whatever}' then it will allow for manually cleanup later.

Hope that helps. The Options API, I think, is pretty intuitive, so you 
should have any problem with it if you have classes and objects down.

Good luck.

Well, I was just talking to Jeremy Visser about this, "we" both came to 
conclusion that the Negative margin-top needs figured out specifically 
for the exact height of the footer which is 65px. SO, in negative 
decimal -5.5 we need it to be exact with 65px...

So, we need to find out in "em" what 65px IS. To help make it work even 
better.

 From the Hack page itself...

In the case where the Web page's contents do not take up the entire 
browser window, the footer will naturally be positioned just below the 
bottom of the window. Once we specify a negative margin that is equal to 
the height of the footer, it will bring it back into view, with its 
bottom resting on the edge of the window.

For the case where the Web page content is larger than the browser 
window, the footer will be positioned naturally below the content, then 
brought up by the margin. For this scenario you should provide a bit of 
space at the bottom of your content which the footer can rise into 
without covering anything. This can be done with a bit of padding or 
margin on your content, as you can see in the CSS above.

*The only drawback to footerStickAlt is that you must know the exact 
height of your footer (whether it be in absolute or relative pixels).* 
However, you have to know this roughly with the original version anyway, 
in order to make room for the footer at the bottom of the content. It's 
generally a non-issue with footers anyway, as they have limited 
information and a sparse layout

That varies between browsers.
1em = 1 line height
Various browsers and forced fontsizes have different lineheights, So you cannot convert between the 2.
However, The examples only use em measurements for their size AFAIK, Theres no reason why you cant use px instead.

I've just added a patch to the ticket i'd like you to have a try of too, its much the same, but seems to work in IE.

Ah okay. I just went to a site that did conversions and used the em 
measurement for 65px. But just made it a negative. http://riddle.pl/emcalc/

That seems to work for me as well. Tried it in 800x600 res and up to the 
highest Res in Firefox. I'm not sure about the other browsers though. At 
least it's "coded" nicer too. Mine could be changed though as well, I 
basically just slapped in the default hack wording and went with it for 
"testing" purposes only lol. Ah well, at least we have two options here 
to have tested and see what happens from here out. =D Thanks again for 
that patch!

And if all possible, and need be, maybe this can be applied to ALL 
versions of WordPress and not just the up-coming 2.5. Cause if I 
remember right, this has been happening for a while now in lesser 
versions too? I'm not sure though, I haven't used an older version in 
how long...

It doesnt look too bad in the 2.3, 2.4(pre redesign) as the background of the footer is transparent, I dont really see a need for its footer to be moved since it doesnt draw attention.
It would be simple to backport it though if needed, It'd near be the same diff file i think.

*Slaps self* I forgot, I just had a copy of 2.1-alpha on the localhost 
yet. It was just in a weird named folder. I pulled that one up to have a 
look-see, and you're right. It's not that noticeable really. But at 
least there's options there to use if wanted/needed though. ;) :)

working late and refusing to sleep. I'll probably clean up my patch once

Does he still play it? I thought he had started piano as a new year's

Anyway, happy birthday, Matt. Have a good one. I still remember the 21st

Thanks for the sanity check. Here's my ticket with attached patch:

As this is my first submitted patch, I can now join the ranks of  
people on the list asking when it'll get committed ;)

I tested 5626.2.diff in IE7 with 1680x1050 res, works fine. The position of
the BrowseHappy logo looks better to, although it could use a bit of space
between it and the edge of the window.

I thought that at first too.. But its just a spacing issue, The text creeps too close to the footer there i think.

I'm refering to this paragraph being just above it:
You can find additional themes for your site in the WordPress theme directory. To install a theme you generally just need to upload the theme folder into your wp-content/themes directory. Once a theme is uploaded, you should see it on this page.

The Browsehappy logo could do with a restyling, I'd like it sitting in a bit from the edge, and slightly higher(to center it)

Message-ID: <4789667B.70104@santosj.name>

*Memory Limit*

On the topic of memory limits, the patch [1] works for increase the 
memory limit. Having it in WordPress might do well to decease the amount 
of support tickets based on 8MB limits. However, it will only work on 
hosts which allow for increasing the memory limit and don't disable 
ini_set() function.

As a bonus, there is an additional API function, which will slow 
increment the memory limit as it is needed. So that function can be 
placed in loops that have known high memory usage and it will increase 
the memory limit. The function is also for plugins which also have that 
same problem and only want to increase the memory limit as it is needed.

*Pre-Activation Hook*

There is no dependency API in WordPress, so there has been times when I 
didn't want my plugin to be enabled until another plugin was enabled. It 
allows me to distribute one plugin with most of the functionality that 
is needed, much like the WordPress Plugin Framework and plugins that 
require that plugin to be enabled first.

There needs to be a way to say to the user, "Oops, sorry, I'm dependent 
on several factors and you don't met those." Which is currently lacking 
in the patch. It might be confusing for users to click activate and have 
WordPress say the plugin was activated, but not have the plugin be 
activated. However, I'm unsure how to do this at this point.

I still would rather have something that allows me prevent my plugin's 
activation until my plugin's requirements are met.

As of 2.4 with the deactivate_plugins() function, Its possible, Allthough not as pretty: (Possible with previous versions if you update the active plugins array yourself)

/*
Plugin Name: I need more recent PHP!
Plugin URI: http://dd32.id.au/
Description: Tests non-activation.
Author: Dion Hulse
Version: 1.0

Requires WordPress 2.4 or later.

*/

register_activation_hook(__FILE__, 'nwp_act');

function nwp_act(){
	global $wp_version;
	if( version_compare( $wp_version, '2.5', '>=') )
		return; //Its WP 2.5 or later
	deactivate_plugins(__FILE__);
	wp_die('<h1>NewerWordPress Plugin</h1>
			<p>This plugin requires WordPress 2.5, which you do not have.</p>
			<p>Click  <a href="plugins.php">here</a> Back to plugins list</p>');

But, when I changed functions.php to ANSI, there was no error.

The settings are still changed, though.

Possibly there is a BOM (byte-order mark) sneaking in there somewhere.
Try looking at it in a hex editor.

Yeah, there are workarounds. My solution was similar to DD32, except I 
didn't have the benefit of a function. However, it would be easier and 
more widely used, if the interface was easier. I can live with DD32's 
suggestion, but I would like to have that functionality outside of the 
activate if at all possible.

I might as well suggest with a little bit of documentation added to the 
codex that the ticket be closed out as "won't fix" since the solution 
doesn't involve manually hacking the active plugins list, which I 
seriously don't want any plugins to do.

Yeah, that is the BOM or at least what it appears when there isn't 
support for it. Happens all the time on my site. Damn Expression Web.

That seemed a little bit too "ZOMG! FAIL!" for my tastes. WordPress is often
very good about not doing that. :-)

I would like to construct a query which returns first name and last name

Hi,
I (and probably many other plugin developers) have become aggravated
with the plugin-submission process of the Plugin Directory on
WordPress.org, particularly how long it takes for a plugin to be
approved.

In short, is there any way to help out with plugin submission by
volunteering to help approve them? Or is this job limited to the lead

Message-ID: <478A452D.5000403@pixelplexus.co.za>

For a plugin that needs to cope with chinese names and characters I'm using:

 `htmlentities(trim($value), ENT_QUOTES, "UTF-8"); `

 

(for data fields that might also end up being post titles).

 

When the data is being parroted back at the user via a form, is there 
any reason not to do something like :

 

`stripslashes(attribute_escape($value))`

 

(I figure attribute_escape being native to the WordPress platform might 
deserve to be respected/retained but I don't want to show escaped 
'quotes' e.g. `\'` as its a critical part of many chinese names)




I seem to be blocked from the forum agin/still, so hope someone here can 
help me please.

Thanx

Andr? SC

You need to use a subselect as a scalar operand in your query. So  
something like the following should work:

SELECT
	(SELECT meta_value from wp_usermeta where meta_key = 'first_name'  
AND user_id = 2) as first,
	(SELECT meta_value from wp_usermeta where meta_key = 'last_name' AND  
user_id = 2) as last,
	wp_users.*
FROM
	wp_users
WHERE
	wp_users.ID = 2

For interest sake, I hear '...WordPress still supports MySQL 4.0, which 
does not allow subqueries *at all* (4.1 and up;'
 so you might need to run the selects separately if its for the wild.

Only if a patch is attached, but I swear if every defect had a test case 
given to Alex, it would go a lot more smoothly. I have plans for doing 
so after the phpdoc is finished. However it will probably be during the 
Summer.

Unless I buy a laptop and use school time for writing unit tests for 
WordPress, I'm not (or maybe... nah). Have to graduate this semester.

Thanks for the tip. While this does work for single user, it also confirms
what I suspected after I sent my e-mail this morning and left the house of
the day.  I didn't really phrase my question correctly.

What I am looking to do is construct a query which will return records for
all users and have the first name and last name from the usermeta table
included in the query results.  Using your example, I tried something like
this (my Wordpress table prefix is "wp_ga_" instead of "wp_"):

SELECT 
	(SELECT meta_value from wp_ga_usermeta, wp_ga_users where meta_key =
'first_name' AND wp_ga_usermeta.user_id = wp_ga_users.id) as first,
	(SELECT meta_value from wp_ga_usermeta, wp_ga_users where meta_key =
'last_name' AND wp_ga_usermeta.user_id = wp_ga_users.id) as last,
	wp_ga_users.*
FROM
	wp_ga_users, wp_ga_usermeta WHERE wp_ga_users.id =
wp_ga_usermeta.user_id

Unfortunately the subselect queries don't return a single row so this
doesn't work.  Any further guidance would be welcome.  Adding the DISTINCT
keyword to the query didn't help either.

Thanks,

Mike

You need to use a subselect as a scalar operand in your query. So  
something like the following should work:

SELECT
	(SELECT meta_value from wp_usermeta where meta_key = 'first_name'  
AND user_id = 2) as first,
	(SELECT meta_value from wp_usermeta where meta_key = 'last_name' AND

user_id = 2) as last,
	wp_users.*
FROM
	wp_users
WHERE
	wp_users.ID = 2

This works for me:

LEFT JOIN (

	FROM `wp_usermeta` 
	WHERE meta_key = 'first_name'

LEFT JOIN (
	SELECT user_id AS uid, meta_value AS lname

returns:

Subject: [wp-hackers] group by in SQL queries
Message-ID: <478B3100.3080401@bolarus.de>

Hi everyone!

Just wanted to share something strange that caused some confusion among 
German WordPress users lately. I don't know if this is already known and 
if anything needs to be done about it (I usually don't read SQL specific 
mails on this list too carefully). Couldn't find something in Trac, but 
I thought a lot of you would know if this needs to be fixed.

For all German speaking people, here is a detailed report on this:
http://schnurpsel.de/wordpress-und-die-suboptimale-mysql-optimierung-5051-74/

For everyone else I'll try to summarize it:

In WP 2.0.x queries for posts contain the following:
   GROUP BY wp_posts.ID
   ORDER BY post_date DESC

The "group by" has no real effect here and has been removed in WP 2.1. 
Now lately a lot of providers updated their MySQL to 5.0.51 where this 
group by doesn't get optimized out of the query anymore. So the effect 
was that suddenly the postings in the blog were not descending by date 
anymore but ascending by ID. So the oldest entry was at the top. A very 
strange effect, and it took some time for a clever user to find the reason.

So the first question is does this need to be fixed in the WP 2.0.x 
releases? I seem to remember that this branch still gets bugfix releases 
every now and then?!

And then for the current WordPress version: The user who reported this 
says it also effects the current versions of WP if you use categories or 
tags in the query, like this:
query_posts( $query_string.'&cat=-8' );

So there is the possibility that something needs to be changed in the 
current version, too. Sorry if I made any mistake in summarizing this. I 
haven't looked into it too closely. Just thought I should mention it 
here. :-)

Greetings,
Johannes

I don't get it. If the order is explicitly defined as ORDER BY
post_date DESC, why would they come back in a different order? How
they are grouped shouldn't make any difference.

If this behavior is actually occurring due to this, then it seems that
it should be reported as a bug in MySQL.

As far as I have understood it (and I'm by no means an SQL guru, so I 
could be wrong here), the GROUP BY has preference over the ORDER BY. 
Once the result is grouped, it would be ordered within each group. Now 
the ID column is an auto-increment column, so each group consists of 
only one post and therefore it doesn't get ordered.

Previously, MySQL apparently knew that a GROUP BY on an auto-increment 
column doesn't make sense and optimized it away. With the new MySQL 
version this doesn't happen anymore. I don't know if this a MySQL bug, 
but even if it is it has an effect on WordPress that's rather severe. 
And we can't tell the usual user to upgrade his MySQL, because that's 
usually done by the provider in rather larger intervals.

After having a quick look at the change log[1], I think it's this change 
that causes this effect:
http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=30596

Greetings,
Johannes

It's still a MySQL bug, and it violates the SQL92 specification. If
you specify an ORDER BY clause, then the order of the rows in the
result set should be ordered that way. How you group them is
irrelevant, as grouping is a separate operation. You're doing one
select here, the order by must apply to the results of that select.

Not saying we don't need to work around it in WordPress, but if MySQL
is this badly broken, then I will certainly be rethinking the idea of
using it for any production level systems in the future.

Thanks very much, this is exactly what I was trying to do, it works
perfectly.  Apparently I need to brush up on my SQL!

LEFT JOIN (
	SELECT user_id AS uid, meta_value AS fname

If you read this you can see at the bottom in links to [2] where a  
fix to this issue was introduced for mysql 5.0.52.

So we shouldn't need to do anything - this is a straight mysql bug!

Ahh, yes. I see it now.

http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32202

The bug is fixed in 5.0.52, according to that. I say that people who
are experiencing the problem need to tell their hosts to upgrade, as
this is surely the cause of the recent weirdness we've seen with
reversed post orders and such.

Thanks for the info! I didn't actually read the page to the end. ;-)
The report on the new bug is this one:
http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32202

Well, in this case a further update of the MySQL version would be indeed 
the better way. Let's hope that most providers do this as soon as possible.

Bye,
Johannes

Is there an easy way to find out what fatal error a plugin gives on
activation?  It's only happening on someone else's server that I don't have
access to.  All they see is the "fatal error" message on the plugins
management page.

Server error log.

they may have to activate PHP logging.

In similar situations, I've just commented out the body of the plugin,
activated it (with no errors), then un-commented it.

That can be kind of sketchy, especially if you don't know what you're doing.
If your commenting, activating, and then uncommenting, it seems that your
error lies within an activation hook.

I think he means that once it's activated with the commented file and then
uncomment it, it'll spit out the error (assuming that you have error
reporting on).  The problem with turning on PHP error logging is that I
don't think the user is an expert in things like that.  This might be an
easier solution for them.

Not necessarily.  Plugin activation will fail for any fatal error, not
just those triggered by an activation hook.

if this worked, then probably the activation was failing due to
exhausting the available memory; amazingly or not, there are still hosts
that use memory_limit = 8M in the php config; a vanilla wordpress was
taking up around 5.5 MB of memory the last time I checked (2.2, I
think), and plugins add to that; I had this problem reported to me with
a plugin that I wrote, and discovered that a php library that I was
using managed to eat about 2 MB of memory, and managed to work around
the problem by loading the thing only when needed.

Isnt this what the Error scrape functionality introduced in 2.2(2.3?) was for? To display any fatal errors while activating on the plugins page? 
Of course, If the server has error's turned off, Then it's not going to show much.

(Maybe WP should enable error printing while activating if its disabled)

Yeah, it should indeed force errors to display.

error_reporting( E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE );

include( 'plugin_file.php' );

Hi,

I am new here and have recently started coding on Wordpress.
I am making a plugin.
I've hooked additional input fields to the edit form using an action hook on
dbx_post_advanced()
I want to store the input in the custom fields.
Which action hook do I need to use to do the same.

Thanks

Hi Mitesh,

Have a peek at the code in
http://climbtothestars.org/code/basic-bilingual.phps -- I created a
function called bb_update_language() and call it with a series of
hooks at the end of the plugin. This should help you.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Regarding Tickets (has-patch needs-testing)
Message-ID: <478CB793.3040808@gmail.com>

I was just wondering about these tickets, wouldn't it be some-what 
better to just add a few of these (that are less complicated) to the 
Trunk, while Trunk is being inspected and tested anyway? IMHO, some of 
these tickets would be better added WHILE currently undergoing "testing" 
for Trunk from the get go.

Example: This ticket here: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5477

User Joe decides to come into the whole Testing Trunk and wanting to be 
part of the WordPress Community as a "tester" for future versions of 
WordPress. Now, if a ticket like that was already "In" the Trunk before 
User Joe comes along, this ticket with the patch would have already been 
included in there, and during the installation process "he" could run 
into this ticket patch first hand and then provide feedback for it.

Or, even "he" doesn't have a problem with "it" and doesn't know it needs 
testing, "us" others that know of the patch could easily test it out by 
simply doing a SVN CO on a NEW localhost install, rather then doing a 
SVN CO, then apply patch, then attempt install to test it.

Same kinda goes for the tickets involving "untested new 
importers/improvements to existing ones" like the following:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2665
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3241
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4472
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4611
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2963
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3398

Not sure if "new testers" would come into the game, expecting to test 
these out if added to Trunk during development, but at least it'd be 
"in" a while to get "love" sooner. Reports could come in faster, more 
attention (to get issues taken care of) asap as well. And heck, even if 
those things don't work out, they could be removed before going Beta and 
or Release.

The other thing I wanted to get out on the table, is, the fact that some 
of the ticket patches were tested, but just given up on. Like this one: 
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4360

I can understand maybe why those were abandoned, but rather then let 
them linger around, going uncommented...  why not just add a comment on 
there saying "this is no longer going to make core, it'd be best left 
for plugin" or some such? Sorry, I just wanted to get these thoughts and 
suggestions out on the table...

*Cough* Would also be awesome if "things" were flagged (only for admins) 
as a color with message "needs testing" report results and such to 
wp-testers list. Once tested and figured to be okay with flying 
colors... a new version of that "change" could come through SVN UP which 
removes the "color flagged messages"... But that's too complicated, so, 
yeah.. =P

It would be nice. Even if there was a flag at the top of the plugin file to
display debug information when installing a plugin.

I didn't know this would be such a widely discussed topic.  Turns out that
they had error reporting and error logging off.  She got her host to turn
error reporting on long enough to find out what the error was.  Thanks for
the input!

Look at the save_post and delete_post actions.

Also, this Codex page lists the actions by category, so you can have 
some hope of answering such questions in the future:

Bah, thanks for the reminder.  I still had the "2.1 would be 4.0 and 2.2
would be 4.1" plan in my head from way back when.  

Subqueries provide some great power and I use them for a lot of internal
stuff.  Anyone not familiar with them should really check them out.  

You can use them on inserts too, in order to add multiple rows, like this:
INSERT INTO `wp_usermeta` (`umeta_id`, `user_id`, `meta_key`, `meta_value`)
VALUES 
(NULL, (select id from `wp_users` where `user_login`='imauser'),
'first_name', 'Ima'),
(NULL, (select id from `wp_users` where `user_login`='imauser'), 'nickname',
'Ima User'),
(NULL, (select id from `wp_users` where `user_login`='imauser'),
'rich_editing', 'false')
)


One thing to remember is that mysql doesn't support insert queries don't
support subselects from the same table you are inserting to.  Temporary
views can be used to get you around that.

Haven't tried it, but wouldn't this work without a subselect?

SELECT ID, user_login, first.meta_value AS fname, last.meta_value AS lname
FROM wp_users
LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS first ON
(wp_users.ID = first.ID AND
first.meta_key = 'first_name')
LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS last ON
(wp_users.ID = last.ID AND
last.meta_key = 'last_name')

With some minor tweaks, yes...

SELECT ID, user_login, first.meta_value AS fname, last.meta_value AS lname
FROM wp_users LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS first ON (wp_users.ID = first.user_id
AND first.meta_key = 'first_name') LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS last ON
(wp_users.ID = last.user_id AND last.meta_key = 'last_name') 

Nice use of sequential joins!

I wasnt aware that Join conditions could have things like that (Honestly: Stupid me, I knew there could be multiple conditions, just never thought of using a literal in one!)

Message-ID: <161617690801160849s56b3a508h88c0b3b3901052a6@mail.gmail.com>

After seeing that the WordPress.org website is supporting BlueHost by
having them highlighted on the top of the list at
http://wordpress.org/hosting/ , I'm forced to ask, why?

BlueHost has shown to be nothing but problematic going by posts in the
forums. There's plenty of threads detailing problems they have with
people complaining about "excessive CPU Usage" and sites going down
for no reason, and other hosting issues.

Then today, I see this one: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/152170

Summary: Somebody comments on this guy's blog and uses the F word and
they kill his site.

Seriously, I could not recommend BlueHost to anybody, as I've never
heard anything good about them. I think GoDaddy is a better host, and
that's saying a lot because I detest GoDaddy hosting. So why is
WordPress.org recommending them? Are they paying for top billing or
something?

-Otto

p.s. Posted to wp-hackers since I'm not sure which list in particular
it should be posted to. Will take discussion to a different list
instead, if it would be more appropriate there.

We get hosting feedback through hosting@wordpress.org.  If we get
enough complaints, we remove the host from the list.  We've only had
to do this once before, but we'll do it again if needed.

Along the same lines, how are hosts added to this page? I use  
WestHost.com for all my client hosting. I would like to get them added  
to the page.

Generally I pick one when another one is removed. If you're looking for 
a more general directory of all the hosts in the world, there are other 
places for that.

I have done most of the TinyMCE integration in WordPress. When they
put up a RC, it is still a long way from final. Normally I like to
wait for at least one bugfix before updating core. This is because the
process is not simple. It involves carving around a lot of WP
customizations.

So, I'll get my hands on it in February or March unless you beat me to it.

Something I'd like to know is, exactly (or as exactly as possible) how
many wp.org users actually use this editor?
I always have the feeling it's completely overkill javascript bloating.

Can't we add something relating to tinymce to the data that get sent
to wp.org by the auto-update thing ? :)

There might be some privacy issues involved. Plus, I actually have it 
enabled, but I don't use the Visual part a lot, so the stats would 
probably be a little wonky.

My guess is that a vast majority use if for no other reason than it is
default and they don't know how to change it.  Also, it's easier to
understand for your average user than html tags.

I've been in touch with Spocke, the main developer of TinyMCE, and he's 
offered to help with the customization/integration for WordPress. The 
API in 3.0 is quite different from the 2.x branch, so most has to be 
rewritten. He expects final 3.0 release at the end of January.

Taking the page text at face value, I would assume that whoever made the
call to put BlueHost on that page has had consistently good experience with
that company.

Based on:
"We've dealt with more hosts than you can imagine; in our opinion, the hosts
below represent some of the best and brightest of the hosting world."

If this is the case with BlueHost (and any others listed on that page),
perhaps it would be useful to put up a quick blurb with some specific (or
even general) details for each provider regarding what warrants their
inclusion in "the best and brightest" category.

I don't think you'd necessarily want to get into the business of allowing
and managing individual user comments on each provider, and adjusting the
list accordingly - that would probably be overkill. But some measure of how
the quoted statement above applies to each provider might go a long way
towards clarifying why a particular host was included, if they have in fact
been included based on merit.

If, on the other hand, this list is primarily driven by which companies have
click-thru benefit arrangements with WP, I think it should be made more
clear that that is the criteria for inclusion on this list. It's not that
there's anything wrong with that, and it is alluded to in the intro
paragraph, but it should probably (IMHO) be made more clear if that
relationship is a primary factor in inclusion.

Why in the world would *anybody* turn off PHP error logging? Turning off
error reporting is understandable, but logging?

If I understand correctly, they had logging enabled on the critical sites on
the server, but never took the time to turn it on for the non-critical
sites.

reporting = production
logging = sysadmins who dont want to have to look through error logs, and would rather just turn on debugging if someone complains
(And being in a shared environment, There'd be lots of errors thanks to non-great-programmers, which could cause the log file to fill up quicklyl)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Commenting on new admin screens?
Message-ID: <478E8529.9090205@poplarware.com>

I realize the new admin screens may still be in flux, but are we allowed 
to file bugs on them yet, and/or comment on them? If so, do you want new 
bugs filed, or is there a central bug in Trac that serves as a place to 
comment on things? If not, when will it be OK to comment and file bugs?

I have a couple of comments on the new Post/Page Edit screen. For 
instance, the new tag entry area needs to have the standard "display" 
filters applied to displayed tag names -- displaying raw names from the 
DB is not good for some plugin users, and it is done in both the pop-up 
list and in the existing tags section below.

Also, I'm concerned about the way the edit screen is now set up. Any 
plugin that previously added a section to the edit screen, to look like 
a regular screen section using the pre-2.5 scheme, will not conform to 
the new scheme and will not have an open/close box any more.  I like the 
new scheme - much easier to code than the previous scheme - but the fact 
that it is changing is going to mean that plugins will either have to 
check versions and output accordingly, or be very WP-version-specific. 
This will be a major pain for plugin developers.

And are there plans to put a Manage Tags section in, basically a clone 
of Mangage Categories, but with Tags?

Ooops, I guess I made my comments, whether or not it is OK to comment 
yet... would be glad to put them in the right place on Trac, if only I 
knew where that was...

I'll use that...and the probelm will be solved. However, if we still 
want to keep page-related items using get_page, I need to either modify 
get_page a little to handle page "0" or I need to make some additional 
tests on the data I get back. Any of the solutions will work, but I'd 
like to employ the one that bests fits with where the code is headed, 
rather than where it's coming from. Any input would be appreciated.

The template function in_category('x') will return true even if you are
viewing the category page itself (not a post within it). Is there a way to
determine if you are looking at post within a category or the category
listing itself?

Thanks,

Bugs like that are fine to file.  We just want to hold off on the
"move this over here and make it rounded and darker blue" type stuff.

I'd like to add some API in 2.5 to make doing this easier and more
portable across versions.  Plugins can check for the presence of the
new API funcs and fallback to their old ways if they're not there.
The admin re-design will cause grief for some plugins.  We'll try to
ease the transition, but we can't shackle ourselves.

It's not on anyone's schedule, that I know of.   Given the
freewheeling nature of tags, adding a manager for them is not a
priority for me.  Pulling this into core would require care regarding
scalability of the code and UI since it is common for people to amass
thousands of tags.  I'm cool with someone opening a ticket if they
want to pitch the feature and do some work on it, but I can't say that
it will for certain make it into 2.5.

Message-ID: <478EA79C.2040304@gmail.com>

Just throwing these out, but...

a) In my 800x600 res screen, on the WRITE POST pane, the little box off 
to right there that has the post status in it. Some how the little box 
got stuck downward to the point where I couldn't click the "save / 
publish" button or whatever. I had to resize the screen resolution to 
get to it. I'm not sure how this happened, but I think something was 
quirky javascript wise or the screen temporarily froze up. Mind you I'm 
still on a computer from 2000, 320MB of Ram (most used up), and crappy 
dial-up connections. So, things are bound to be slow and quirky. I just 
went to the WRITE POST now and the little box is fine.

b) I kinda miss the old tag insert field. At least before while using 
(awesome) Firefox... I could just click inside the field, start typing 
in a tag that I had used on previous post and a bunch loads below for 
options for which to use. With this new insert field, I gotta manually 
add all the ones I want to use. And if I forget to add them BEFORE 
saving the draft / publishing post, then I have to manually re-add them 
all again. Where as before, the Firefox basically "remembers" what was 
filled in the insert field previously. That doesn't work with this new 
one, which kinda sucks... =(

c) Another 800x600 res issue, if someone wants to try this out 
themselves please do. Scroll down on the WRITE POST screen, the rest of 
the stuff on left side flows up, the little box on Right Side goes down 
behind footer. I know "we" implemented that footer fix, but I'm thinking 
there should be some more padding at base of .wrap class, or padding on 
the top of footer... Because the Bookmarklet links are behind the footer 
itself too.

I think that's all for now. I just wanted to get these out on the table 
now. =)

That's happening as the box seems to be absolutely positioned a certain ammount from the top of the screen(Allthough, Looking in Operas developer tools, I cant see why thats so), As soon as you get a low resolution it starts breaking.

Whats the lowest resolution which is going to be supported in the new interface though? Its incredibly hard to cater for those of us with large screens, and those with small screens sich as 800x600.
Those on mobiles/small screen devices should probably use a different admin skin all together anyway.

I'd recommend BlueFur [1]. Great host, PHP 5, MySQL 5 (on their latest
servers, soon to be all servers, though) and... well... a lot of other
stuff. :P They offer managed WordPress hosting to.

There's is a minor bug I see, but I don't think it warrents a Trac ticket,
so I'll just post it here.

In IE7 (not sure about others), the comment count is not centered in "the
bubble", but in FF it is...

Since the comment bubble has been mentioned, In Opera (9.5 at least), The comment count is half way between the end of the tab sections and the right side of the screen.. (ie. position is relitive to the comments tab rather than relitive to the left side of the screen).

My feellng is if you actually care if somebody fixes it or not, report  
a bug.

Bug tracking systems make much better planning aids that group mailing  
list inboxes.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Conditional text replacement
Message-ID: <15E60E34-0D2B-4971-AB0E-1324B8A40334@gmail.com>

I'd like a super simple way to have phpthumbs.php use ImageMagick to  
resize images. I tried using a plugin filter to translate, say,  
[[image.jpg]] to:

<img src="../phpThumb.php?src=http://domain.com/path/to/ 
image.jpg&amp;w=400" alt="" />

That works fine but what is needed is for image width (w=400 in the  
example above) to be a set value depending upon the CSS id of an  
element it is contained within (eg. <body id="sales">). That way one  
image tag automatically gets resized to fit the column width of  
whatever template it's used in.

I understand how to create an array but not how to apply it  
conditionally. What would be the most efficient way to do this?

Robert

Why would it do that? It's looking at the global $post, which should
not be set until you've called the_post().

That sounds like appropriate behavior.  If you're viewing the page
that has the category that should return true don't you think?

Yes, the behavior is fine - I just used the is_category function to solve my

That sounds good, if not essential. Is there a trac issue filed on it 
so we can watch, comment, etc.? Anyway, it would be great if it gets 
into place soon, so plugin authors can try to be ready for the new 
release... as I am sure you are aware, many of us fit in plugin 
development and other WP work in between work that pays, so a little 
extra time is always good. :)

I did file bugs on the other two issues I noted in my earlier email... 
will try to work up patches as time permits.

Cheers,
    Jennifer

So the intention with the comments box (the little popup looking thing) 
is for it to be variable width, the text to be centered, for it to have 
a hover of #264761.

The comments number on the manage posts screen should also have the same 
style.

Both are confounding me, any CSS gurus want to take a whack at it? 
Changing the markup is fine.

I finally sat down with a completely clean and virgin install of  
WordPress 2.3.2 and traced what happens when you make a permalink  
request for a non-existent URL.

Two sets of URLs to use as examples and context:

These are valid URLs:
http://site.org/archives/101
http://site.org/page-name

These are _not_ valid URLs:
http://site.org/archivezorz/101
http://site.org/favicon.ico

Valid URLs get parsed, expected MySQL queries get executed, and the  
results are processed and returned to the browser. The problem is that  
invalid URLs that get sent through WordPress still result in a query  
like the following being executed on the database:

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS  test_posts.* FROM test_posts  WHERE 1=1   
AND post_type = 'post' AND (post_status = 'pub
lish' OR post_status = 'private')  ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 10

That is, even after a URL is sent through WP->parse_request() and  
found to be invalid/404, WordPress marches on to WP->query_posts() and  
hits the database with a generic request for the X most recent posts.  
And because this is executed for every 404, it actually results in a  
lot of database activity.

In most cases MySQL has cached the result, and so it poses a minimal  
load on the server. And even if the cache is stale, for most sites  
it's not a particularly resource intensive query.

But, if you've got 350,000 rows in the posts table, it's incredibly  
resource intensive to order all those posts on the post_date  
(datetime) column. I've seen hundreds of them pile up and take  
_forever_ to complete after writes to the table. It's sufferable if  
write activity on the posts table is very low, but that's not  
something I want to hope for.

So here's my question:
Do we actually want to execute that query for every 404 under normal  
circumstances? If not, is this (or something like this) the stupidest  
solution?

wp-includes/classes.php:WP->query_posts()

	function query_posts() {
		global $wp_the_query;
		$this->build_query_string();

		// return if the request URI is a 404
		if( $this->did_permalink && $this->query_vars['error'] == '404' )
			return;

		$wp_the_query->query($this->query_vars);
  	}

The above works, but there's probably a better way to write it.

Thoughts?

wp-includes/canonical.php and some 404 templates expect that
WP_Query::parse_request() has run.  I think calling that on its own
without calling the DB parts of WP_Query would work.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5611 - WordPress 2.5 PHPdoc corrections.

Thanks for joining the effort! Hopefully and if you are interested, if you
search "phpdoc" on the WordPress Trac, you will find open tickets many of
whom have PHPdoc templates for all of the functions.

If you apply the patch, then you can just fill in the blanks and replace
the "{@internal Missing ...}}" content. The choice to do that is if
someone else comes along, they'll at least have the template stuff done
and will immediately conform to the WordPress inline standard [1].

Dude. Totally. This is to anyone that helps out with the PHPdoc effort,
"Thank You!"

I can't see how to make it variable width without either adding a
specific class to the comment li (that might be useful anyway), or
adding another element to the comment bubble (another span, or an
anchor).

Yes, that's the one that's there now.

Either is fine. The markup isn't fixed.

Put it bluntly, nobody can help you here. Wordpress isn't tailored for Asian
languages. Being able to show glyphs on Asian languages is already good
enough.

If we're all recommending our favorite hosts.... Lunarpages FTW :)

Awesome prices, excellent *phone* technical support (toll-free), PHP5,
awesome machines, and no downtime.

Message-ID: <47915E31.6010709@cubegames.net>

Is documentation for the api.wordpress.org service available? Even 
better, the source code? I'm looking into building a version checker 
into my own software and, although it seems easy to build my own based 
on what is returned, it would be really handy to see the source to see:

    * What the php_version parameter is used for
    * What the locale parameter is used for
    * Any other tricks you might use

If not, I'll write my own, but can you answer those questions please? 
It's really bugging me :-)

(Not sure if I sent this already, but it was sitting in my drafts folder)

Thanks,
Ryan.

I would just send the exact header that WordPress sends and see what is 
returned. Then do it again with different data and record. I'm not sure 
if WordPress.org has documentation on the black box they use, but there 
is currently not a way to redirect the ping to your site (unless that is 
part of the Blackbox API based on the URL).

Anyway, I'm not interested in this topic, but if I was going to crack 
the API, that is the method I would use to do so. Sort of like 
regression testing, in my opinion.

Well, good luck hacking the API, if you do succeed (and there isn't any 
reason you shouldn't), then it would be awesome if /you/ documented the 
results.

Pretty easy to do that anyway. Just change the server name and do a 
var_dump(). But that's not what I'm after. I'm after what it does 
internally.

Pure guess here:

$plugins = unserialise($_POST['unsafe_data']); //(Probably some checks in here)
$updated_plugins = array();
foreach( $plugins as $plugin){
	$info = lookup_plugin($plugin['name']);
	if( $plugin['version'] < $info['version'] ) //Use version_compare() here
		$updated_plugins[ $plugin['name'] ] = $info;
}

if( !empty( $updated_plugins ) ){
	echo serialize($updated_plugins);
}

Its not all that difficult to do really, Its simply a version check. I think Matt posted awhile ago they were working on some API documentation, But didnt have any available at the time, The phpversion parameter was just for stats to find out what most users currently use(allthough i dont think they were logging that at that time), And the blogurl they were ignoring at the time.. Probably still do.

Yeah, that's what I figured. If the source isn't available, I'll do my 
own and make it available :)

Both are unused currently, but the idea is that if there was a new 
version of a plugin that was only compatible with, say, PHP 5.2.1 it 
could figure that out and only show you the newest version compatible 
with your setup. This becomes more important when there's one click install.

Same thing with locale, think pre-localized plugins that might get 
updates at different times.

>    * Any other tricks you might use

Having a unique global identifier (like a slug) makes things infinitely 
easier. The only real complexity in our code is the juggling the 
identifiers for plugins. For the core version check it's literally a 
hard-coded file with some version compare switches, designed just to be 
as fast as possible because we didn't know what the load would be like 
post-launch, no DB access at all.

Thanks Matt. I assumed it would be basically that, and had already coded 
the core part up. It's good to know that it's hardcoded, as I was 
wondering about that in particular.

I look forward to --stealing-- borrowing much more of your code in the 
future :-)

Thanks,
Ryan.

Tons. While everyone on this list knows what they are doing when it comes to
HTML, think about all of the grandmas and such who are completely clueless
when it comes to HTML. They all prefer TinyMCE.

At least that's been my experience when it comes to my clients. They ALL use
it.

Yup. Would be interesting to see some metrics though, not just on 
TinyMCE but wordpress blogs ingeneral, maybe a central directory 
including WordPress.com, indi installs with some kind of folksonomy - 
why should del.iceous, MBL and dare i say it G etc have all the fun, 
even a nice synergy with gravatars. Wonder if its something Automatic 
would be interested in...

But I digress, for day to day stuff in my experience even most html 
knowledgeble users prefer the quick-and-easy of T.MCE, why type if you 
can click...

Perhaps including a "WordPress may send anonymous usage stats" option (deselected by default) in the next release, or prefreably, as a plugin(perhaps bundled) to generate some stats of what WordPress users use, ie, PHP Version, Mysql Version, If users use this function, or that function.. 
Quite a lot of desktop applications have something similar these days (usually automatically selected), so i assume a lot of users are comfortable with such details.

Of course, You would want stats to be uniquely identified.. Probably by a hash of the blog URL(To prevent people complaining of a central directory of known functions/plugins running on any blog, as it can supposably increase the risk of installs if its known(Ref: The tinfoil brigade, on the Plugin version checking))

D
(Please, No flames or counter-arguements on that Blog URL business.. A central directory wouldnt increase the risk dramatically(IMO), and allthough security would be pretty good i assume, Some people just do not want information about them or products they use stored anywhere at all, So its all of personal opinion, Not something anyone needs to be argued about right now, Leave that to whoever designs it if it ever happens)

But, what would be the point of having the stats uniquely identifiable?

To prevent counting a users details twice, or to track changes over time(ie. php version has been upgraded every month, only 50% of users upgrade to newwer plugin version when available, etc)

Ah, I understand.

On a more related note, switching between Visual and HTML is now broken in
IE7 (works fine in FF2) on trunk.

That's pretty much what I as thinking. I imagine something like a 
tracking pixel similar to google analytics' urchin but with a smaller 
apparant code footprint, configurable in terms of what it broadcasts and 
how often. e.g. admin data only || front-end stats only || both. Me 
thinks if it offered some real value, e.g. link juice, relevant traffic 
or usefull stats/analytics many if not most users would go for it. Those 
who want to be the www's best kept secrets can stay that way. The main 
challenge I see is scaling and capacity.

Plugin download stats for example only tells you how many downloads but 
a download isn't an indication of whether the plugin was ever actually 
installed or is in use for that matter. (if a plugin throws a fatal 
error on each and every install, maybe the author and potential users 
could be notified - can't be hard for an automated process to provide 
more usefull information than the typical  'your plugin broke my blog, 
what must i do!?' email :-)

More insteresting, how many businesses use WordPress? (I'd vote for a 
human && computer / user && adminestrator approach to organizing the 
information:-) How many wordpress installs are in various languages, 
should we be paying more attention to e.g. Chinese  and other asian, 
Arabic etc. languages and their issues?

Just my 20c in small change

Probably integrate with the current WP Stats and the smiley face icon.

Actually, now that I've had a coffee, it might make more sense to 
transmit the admin data inderectly via e.g. a dedicated RSS feed but I 
can't think of a way to reliably measure and transmit front-end viewing 
metrics without an pixel-cookie-IP combination (and its bandwidth cost) 
without creating temptations for gaming the system.

I think we should let user know we are tracking them, and by default
they are disabled, user can enable them if they want, otherwise, don't
do that.

Here's an attempt at the comment counter.

Just needed an extra anonymous span in there.

The bubble expands out to the left as the number gets bigger, big  
numbers are OK.

Hi,

Might be a stupid question, but is there a way to download the latest  
stable version without "knowing" what the latest stable version is?  
I'd like to be able to do

svn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/current

or something to that effect...

It would be pretty hard to do in SVN. You have to do it by creating a
"stable" branch, and be forever merging changes into it.

Now, my idea was to create a redirect to the latest stable tag, but
unfortunately SVN bombs out when it encounters a redirect ("Error 301"
or "Error 302" or the like) instead of following it.

This has been discussed before, and the general consensus was that it
was impossible/impractical.

If you're doing this via a script, you may be able to query
api.wordpress.org for the latest version somehow, and then download the
right tag from what a.w.o returns.

The subject line is a bit of a joke, but might it be worth discussing
what the MySQL acquisition means to WordPress, if anything? I understand
and recall that wordpress.com experimented with Solaris back in its
early days (It's LiteSpeed and GNU/Linux now), but will the major
development have any impact on:

1. The bottom level of the stack at WP.com;
2. Various optimisations associated with Solaris (see articles from Don
Marti in LinuxWorld/IDG);
3. MySQL exclusivity/MySQL's supported version; and
4. Sponsorship/s of some kind?

Just curious.

If nothing has changed, that's excellent news too.

yeah I know, but those aren't SVN branches, and SVN makes updating so  
much easier ;)

It's not so hard to do an svn switch every time a new major version comes
out.

It's still a frustration that it's necessary to do so. I've delayed
upgrading in the past because I know it means I have to look up the
latest version URL every time. "Not a big deal" is a poor excuse for
avoiding implementing a simple centralized fix that would make a lot
of people's lives easier.

Hmm... I wonder about the possibility of a small plugin that could
augment the little upgrade notice with a pre-fab svn command that you
can then just paste into a shell.

Ok, I just updated my SVN install, and I'm loving in particular the
write post page in the new UI.  I was surprised to see non-modal
windows for adding media, but it is super cool.  Also adding links is
in a much better place underneath the "write" tab.

I am curious as to why "Design" wouldn't be included in the right hand
seemingly admin links.  I would think "plugins" and "theme" would be
both in the same area for info arch.

But never-the-less, I'm excited to see how this develops.

The latest version URL is just
http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/x.x where x.x is the major and
minor version number, i.e. 2.3. Not exactly hard to remember, and by using a
branch rather than a tag you know that URL will remain the latest stable
branch for several months at least (until the next major point version).

It seems like it might be better for us all to focus on contributing to
Integrate Automatic Upgrade
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5560


Link to discussion from last:
[wp-hackers] SVN: /branches/stable/
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-September/008828.html

The main points against seemed to be:

Ryan & Peter:
"svn copying to the same branch over-and-over doesn't work that well
because moves and deletes are not accounted for.  We might be able to
svn merge but that can get messy."

 Matt:
At the end of the day, you probably don't want fully automatic
upgrading as you don't know if the "stable" release of 2.1 (or 2.0) is
going to break something you have.

 My best guess would be a well-scripted way to SVN SWITCH several
installs would be the safest.



Hope that helps,

The code in the patch handles all resizing well.

I have to say, this comment makes sense. Design is likely to be used
rarely and definitely fits more with users and plugins than with posts
and comments. Was there a specific reason to break the otherwise
left=content right=admin organization?

One other thing about the recent changes: In the write screen the new
optional settings boxes ( the replacements to the whole DBX thing)
only drop down if you click the tiny arrow on the left. While the
animation and change make sense, this is a ridiculously tiny target
for people to press (remember, grandma hasn't been practising her FPS
games, so she's out of practice with her mouse). If I was going
through several posts in a row to add optional settings I might end up
screaming.

Is there a reason not to have the whole box heading be active for
opening it? That seems like it would be expected behavior, or at least
no one would be mad if the box opened too easily, compared to it being
a hassle to get open.

Very interesting stuff so far though. I'm excited!.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Category template w/ image -subcat with image
Message-ID: <93FAFE66-DAD4-4E2A-B297-EBDACCC5C2BD@daivmowbray.com>


Hello lis, out of lurk mod, I hope I can ask this type of question here.

I've been editing my category template. I wanted the cat description  
to have an image, I found a plugin which put a full editor into the  
description text window, didn't like that idea. Found a hack to not  
strip out html tags from the text window content, didn't like that  
much either. So with a little more searching I found some code snips   
in the forums and went to work.

Any comments, suggestions on how to make this cleaner or better, more  
than welcome. Also my last issue with this is that when in sub cat  
page, the Sub cat image displays, but the image also displays in the  
sub cat list below. How can I remove the repeated sub cat image?  
Thank you.
view issue here.
http://portfolio.daivmowbray.com/media/sites/personal-sites/

What I wanted was a template which pulled an image based on the  
category name and placed the cat description, plus any sub categories  
would also have an image and it's description as link title. If there  
is no image a default would be placed, if there is no default the cat  
title would be placed. The image size is read from the image so each  
cat can have a different size image.

Here's the result;
php to be pasted into your category.php file inside your template  
folder:
<div class="category-image">
<?php
$category = $wp_query->get_queried_object();
$parent = ($category->category_parent) ? $category->category_parent :  
$category->cat_ID;
$catnice_image = $category->category_nicename.'.jpg';
$catname = $category->cat_name ;
$image_path = (TEMPLATEPATH);
$image_url=get_bloginfo('stylesheet_directory');
$catdefault = $image_url .'/images/category/default- 
category.jpg' ; // default image browser url
$catdefaultpath = $image_path .'/images/category/default- 
category.jpg' ; // default image server path
$catfile = $image_path .'/images/category/'. $catnice_image;
$catimage = $image_url .'/images/category/'. $catnice_image;
// check if cat has a description and set it into $catdesc
if ( !(''== category_description()) ) : $catdesc = apply_filters 
('archive_meta', category_description()); endif;
// check if images are in their place and present them if they are.
if( file_exists($catfile)) {
list($width, $height, $type, $attr) = getimagesize($catfile);
$cat_img = '<img src="' .$catimage . '" alt="' . $catname . '" '. 
$attr.' />'.$catdesc.''."\n\n";
} else if ( file_exists($catdefaultpath) ){
list($width, $height, $type, $attr) = getimagesize($catdefaultpath);
$cat_img = '<img src="' .$catdefault . '" alt="' . $catname . '" '. 
$attr.' />'.$catdesc.''."\n\n";
} else {
$cat_img = $catdesc ;
}
echo $cat_img ;

// check to see if there are sub cats , close category-image div and  
open sub cats div.
$cats = get_categories('child_of='.$parent.'');
if (count($cats) == 0) {
}
else {
echo '<br class="brclear" /></div><div class="sub-cats">';

// start the sub cats image and descriptions with linked images
$count=1;
foreach ((array)$cats as $cat) {
$subcatdesc = attribute_escape(strip_tags($cat->category_description));
$image = $cat->category_nicename .'.jpg';
$subcatimage = $image_url .'/images/category/'. $image;
$subcatpath = $image_path .'/images/category/'. $image;
$subcatdefault = $image_url .'/images/category/default-subcat.jpg';
$subcatdefaultpath = $image_path .'/images/category/default-subcat.jpg';
if( file_exists($subcatpath) ) {
list($width, $height, $type, $attr2) = getimagesize($subcatpath);
$subcat_img = '<div class="sub-cat" id="sub-cat-'.$count.'"'.'><img  
src="' .$subcatimage. '" alt="' . $cat->cat_name . '" '.$attr2.' / 
 ><p>'.$cat->cat_name.'</p></div>'."\n\n";
} else if ( file_exists($subcatdefaultpath) ){
list($width, $height, $type, $attr2) = getimagesize($subcatdefaultpath);
$subcat_img = '<div class="sub-cat" id="sub-cat-'. 
$count.'"'.'>category_nicename .'"><img src="' . $subcatdefault . '"  
alt="' . $cat->cat_name . '" '.$attr2.' /><p>'.$cat->cat_name.'</p></ 
div>'."\n\n";
} else {
$subcat_img = '<div class="sub-cat" id="sub-cat-'.$count.'"'.'><p>'. 
$cat->cat_name.'</p></div>'."\n\n";
}
echo $subcat_img ;
$count++;
}
}
// close either sub-cats div if opened or, close category-image div
echo '<br class="brclear" /></div>';
?>

You would need to place the following images into /yourtemplate/ 
images/category/
<ul>	<li>default-category.jpg</li>
	<li>default-subcat.jpg</li>
	<li>your_cat_slug.jpg</li>
	<li>your_subcat_slug.jpg</li></ul>

The css for this is pretty straight forward:
`
.category-image{
margin-top:12px ;
padding: 10px;

font-size: 0.9em
}
.category-image img{ float: left; margin-right: 20px;}
.category-image p{ }
.sub-cats{ font-size: 0.9em;}
.sub-cats p{ margin: 6px}
.sub-cat{
float: left;
text-align: center;
padding: 6px;
margin: 10px;
border: solid 1px #898989;
}
.sub-cat p{}`

Why does this code:

displays: http://www.absinto.org/?p=38http://tags.sapo.pt/post?v=3&url=

Instead of:

I'm going bezerk :(

Any help would be appreciated.

Because "the_permalink" echoes instead of returning the permalink.
You want "get_permalink" instead.

Hi,

I'm developing a plugin to display a button to a Portuguese bookmark 
service. It's already runninng  well, it appears on all the posts.

But what I'd really like is to have in the write article page near the 
editor a checkbox so users can select only the posts they want to have 
the button.

How can I achieve this ?

Any help would be appreciated.

Which is why it appears before the variable is assigned. Process: echo

You probably want to store this value in the post meta. Look up the
get_post_meta(), add_post_meta(), and update_post_meta() functions.

Now, as for creating the checkbox, you most likely want to look up one
of the dbx hooks (check out <http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks> and
<http://wphooks.flatearth.org/> for a list of hooks).

Is there any reason why wp_generate_tag_cloud() uses explicit font-sizes 
rather than using classes? One would assume that for semantics it would 
be better to use classes, like tag-highpop, etc. I'd be willing to 
contribute a patch to this effect if needed, but was just wondering if 
there was any reason to the thinking behind it.

Using classes would require a CSS file to stylize those classes. Therefore,
I think specific font sizes are being used to prevent the need for a CSS
file.

I think the reason would probably be that so many templates don't have 
classes set up for that kind of thing, so it wouldn't work in existing 
setups.  However, having said that, I'd prefer it to be classes.

What about having an extra parameter in $args to specify whether to use 
classes or to use explicit font sizes?

Thanks,

You could also write a plugin to hook the wp_generate_tag_cloud filter and
either replace stuff in the generated list or completely rewrite it.

The only downside there is that the filter comes after all the other
processing, so if you wanted to build the list a different way, the standard
list would always be generated anyway and then thrown away. It's just a
minor performance concern, but it's probably worth mentioning.

Message-ID: <4795AA76.7080909@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to write a plugin to add a checkbox to the write articles 
page, but it doesn't appear.

My code is:

function sapo_tags($id)
{

//delete the existing field
delete_post_meta($id, 'checkbox');
//Get the value from your form
$userEnteredValue = $_POST["userEnteredValue"];
//Add your value as a custom field with the key 'myKey'
//but only if the form data exists
if (isset($userEnteredValue) && !empty ($userEnteredValue)){
add_post_meta($id, 'checkbox', $userEnteredValue);}

}

Any ideas ?

Any help would be appreciated.

I think it should be a lower bound to change the theme than to create a new 
plugin or hack into WordPress code, to get a different look.

A theme is the view, which presents the information to the users. HTML should 
not be written by PHP code.

It's OK to keep backwards compatible with plugins, but adding new features 
like tags does not automagically -have- to work with older themes.

Make the developers be forced to update their themes; it's called evolution 
and is good for development.

OK.
Are you hooking this function?
Just writing the function is not enough.
And yeah the function u've given is the one to process your checkbox, and
not show it..
I guess u will be having a function to show it.
All of these functions need to be hooked.
The one to show the checkbox needs to be hooked to dbx_page_advanced &
dbx_post_advanced.
This will show your checkbox just below the Upload form.
The one to process the checkbox needs to be hooked to edit_post, save_post &
publish_post.

But as you can see here:

The check box and the green little picture is in the bottom left corner.
I'd like to have them where the red rectangle is.

I can't fin nothing similar to manage_posts_custom_column but applied to

Does anyone knows how to do this ?

I assume by new row you mean an extra box at the bottom.

If so this plugin does just that (and not a lot else)

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to determine install version of MySQL?
Message-ID: <B33C8397-3765-49C2-8B46-BCE40D46C558@gmail.com>

The conversation here awhile back regarding SQL queries brought up an  
issue that I have with a my archive filter plug-in. To filter the the  
archives I am using a query similar to the one in wp_get_archive.  
However, there is a subquery that I use to limit the posts to those  
included (or excluded) from specified categories. Since WP supports  
older versions of MySQL that do not support subqueries, the plug-in  
would not work.

Is there a hook/method that I could use to not allow the plug-in to  
be activated unless MySQL is v5 or better?

Thanks,

Phil

Dear John,

You are right, this the WP guru's list (no offense intended), but I've 
joined the list in order to learn. In the forum there are never answers 
for advanced topics.

Although I've been blogging for five years, I only use WP for a week and 
I'm eager to learn how to hack it.

Warm Regards,
M?rio Gamito

I don't think there currently is, but I'm definitely no expert.

If I was writing it, a true novice, I would first try to borrow some
of the code from:

No. The reasoning was explained recently in trac:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3792

You can write an SQL query to check the version of MySQL installed if 
you really want to, but you're strongly encouraged not to.

Had anyone given any thought to how the content of the classes should work?

I ask, because if the intention is for people to add more classes to
style.css in their theme,  they're not going to add an infinite number of
classes <: and at some point, you could end up in a situation where you have
a tag using the class tag-cloud-item-n+1 which wouldn't be styled properly
(and you'd probably have to go back and adjust the other n styles, too.
Sucks.)

Generating the CSS based on the number of times the most popular tag is used
would be a little more practical;  but has trade-offs in that it would be an
additional CSS file that would need to be included (so themes would need
tweaking),  and you also lose a bunch of control over how it looks (unless
you add eleventy billion parameters to control everything).

(In UTW,  I did it with styles against individual items to avoid the "not
enough classes" issue,  while also skipping the linking-to-generated-CSS
issue (The alternative being, I guess, a wodge of CSS in the page;  but then
there's the issue of making sure it shows up just the once.  So many little
ways it could go wrong!).  That said, it was pretty easy to ask UTW to
generate a tag cloud with classes)

*cough*

And isn't this the kind of interface thing that widgets and plugins can deal
with, anyway?  (jus' sayin')

I agree.  Along the same line for tags, we need to implement a 
get_tag_cloud function that returns the string, rather than echoing it.  
Similar to get_the_content and the_content. I added a patch to trac:

I was thinking something like tag-high-pop, tag-norm-pop, etc. Although, 
the names need not really matter. Anything would be an improvement.

Greeting all and Happy 2008.

On all the clients sites I develop, I make sure to keep the meta  
reference to the WordPress version in the header. This got me  
thinking. Is anyone aware of a stats system that tracks this  
information? For example, somewhere I can submit a client site URL,  
and like NetCraft or similar, it will poll the site on a regular  
period to collect the WP version.

If not does anyone think this would be beneficial information to anyone?

I think the point of the -hackers list is hacking WordPress -- i.e. writing
plugins. Therefore, Mario's questions fall right under that. I wouldn't even
bother asking questions about writing questions in the support forums.

It would sure be nice if that data could be automatically polled through a
search engine or something.  Most people who would submit their blogs to a
service like this would probably be people keeping fairly up to date blogs.
Also, the version number is now being sent to Automattic.  I don't know if
they're storing it or considering releasing stats about that data.

Now this is interesting. I was wondering if somewhere in the code  
there would be some outbound stat information send to some central  
server. Though I was under the impression that the group were fans of  
opt-in options only.

It's part of the update checking process.  At the time Matt said that
Automattic wasn't storing the data yet, because they weren't sure of the
impact it would have on their servers.

There was a big stink about it:

What Tantek does is actually use the <big> and <small> elements, nested. 
He feels that's the most semantic use. You can see it in action on 
Technorati. (Not sure if it survived redesigns after he left.)

How about producing styles of 100+n percent ?  Then the cloud itself  
can have a font size set (say... 80%), and individual tags within  
would be sized relative to that.  The 80% would be the smallest tags....

Matt pointed out in an email to me that it's being sent to WordPress.org,
not Automattic.  He's right of course.  Also, regarding the stink, I'm not
trying to stir anything up, just giving a history.

The current Technorati front page appears to use nested <em></em>  
elements. I read somewhere over the summer the <em> is one of the few  
available HTML elements that can be nested. So in effect each tag node/ 
item is wrapped in a number of nested <em> </em>s. The CSS for this is  
simpler since you can increase the relative font size by using  
something like:

<div id="tagcloud">
	<em><em><a href="">name</a></em></em>
	<em><em><em><em><a href="">WordPress</a></em></em></em></em>


#tagcloud em {
	font-style: normal;
	font-size: 1.05em;
}

This will scale the font very nicely, The obvious down side is the  
extra character count added to the weight of the page. Oh bother.

I?m using and installing in quite every blog I set up this:

http://www.yellowswordfish.com/index.php?pagename=admin-drop-menus-wordpress-plugin

maybe less lightweight than the implementation you suggest but a ready
made wheel without need to reinvent it :)

Is this the same thing?  It has odd things shown in the screen

WordPress developers are concerned about usability so they shun drop-
downs.

By the way, being naturally skeptical of all new ideas, I tested 
Paul's suggestion of nested EM tags, and it does render as larger text 
for more EMs in Firefox 2, IE 6, and Opera 9. I don't do Mac, but if 
those 3 do it the same, probably Safari would too?

Hey guys, I'm a bit of a newbie to Wordpress, so pardon me if I've wandered
onto the dev list.

I'm not a newbie programmer by any means, but today I've been taking a first
crack at extending an existing plugin and running into some ajax problems,
probably due to my lack of understanding of how WP does it.

I've registered an action:

add_action('wp_ajax_nzshpcrt_createbucket','nzshpcrt_createbucket');

And the nzshpcrt_createbucket function exists.. My ajax gets hit in the
admin page and sends the request to:

wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
?action=nzshpcrt_createbucket&name=Tester22233&cookie=[snip...]

That returns a simple 0 which tells me I'm not getting the output of the
function back, which should be JSON. So, what have I missed? How do I check
into why Wordpress is not doing what I think it should be doing?

Also, is there any docs on this side of WP? The only bit I found was a
tutorial that gave me the basics, but no reference material.

This is the most interesting idea I've seen here, but I still don't
see any problems with using explicit sizes.

I do not like the idea of a finite number of size classes for tag
clouds. The wrong assumption is that classes are a better semantic
representation than rational numbers for the infinite-and-bounded
range of values expressed by a tag cloud. When you reduce that range
to a finite set of values, you must force different values into group
together and thereby lose information. It is beyond lossy; it is
destructive.

To answer the OP's question, explicit sizes have the following benefits:

* There are an infinite number of possible sizes because any rational
number (e.g. 3.14159) will work.
* Rational numbers do not need to be defined in a stylesheet.
* Rational numbers are compact and easy to understand.
* It is easy to give the user control over the size ranges: upper and
lower bounds are familiar font sizes.

There are also some interesting things you can do to manipulate the
data in rational number format that you cannot do with nested
big/small tags or pre-defined classes: you can write code to change
the way the browser represents the data.

For example (not that I've seen it done, but feel free to try it)
there can be a javascript function written to allow the viewer to sort
the terms according to any value associated with each term, such as
its font size. In this way, you can convert a cloud into an ordered
list. I have seen tables that can be sorted by different columns; why
not the ability to switch the cloud's size basis to different values
(post count, comment count, view count, etc.) or to convert between
clouds and tables? This would not be so straight-forward without
rational numbers.

So I hope we leave it the way it is.

Are you sending a GET request as that implies or a POST request?

admin-ajax.php handles POST requests.

Did you read:

The only other doc is the WP code itself, such as looking at

In essence, my idea would be solid numbers.  To specify my previous  
note a bit more:

We could use PHP to assign inline styles -- e.g. style="font-size:  
104%" -- based on the "rank" of the tags.  Work the math so that the  
smallest size is 100% (100+0) and the largest is, say, 200% (100 
+100).  Depending on the size of the range, the increments could be  
tightened up -- e.g. if there are only ten sizes, the calculation  
might be 100+(n*10) percent; if 200 sizes, it might be 100+(n*0.5)  
percent.

The theme could then set the overall sizing by giving a size to the  
entire list.

Without any offense intended to Ozh, I think that version is very
weird conceptually and literally challenging from a mousing
perspective to use. (any time you can accidentally 'fall off' the zone
you need to stay on I think you have a usability problem)

I've used the Yellow Swordfish plugins on my sites for a long time now
(i like the earlier ones better actually) and enjoyed them but dont'
give them to clients because they can also be kind of strange to use,
especially because they put the submenus under the headings as
dropdowns in a way that makes them not display at all as children of
the current page. So unlike the normal wp interface, you aren't shown
a buffet of the children of the page you are currently working on to
choose from, you have to mouse over the current page menu item to see
the dropdown just like the other menu items. This makes it harder for
people unfamiliar with the menu choices (i.e. clients) but easier for
pros who know where everything is. So it's a good plugin, but bad idea
for core.

I think an better solution would be to have the menu items display
like they currently do (children or siblings of the current page in
the submenu), but those with children have an arrow or other button
beside them, clicking the arrow shows a dropdown with that page's
children, whereas clicking the menu item  itself takes you to that
page like it currently does (if you can't imagine it, think of the
'back' button in Firefox and the arrow that lists the last X pages
rather than just going back one). This way all current behaviors are
valid and people who don't want to think about dropdowns can just
ignore them, but they are there for those who want it.

Personally, I'm still not convinced that this is completely necessary
for core. If there was a plugin that did what i describe above I would
probably be satisfied to install it on blogs that need a lot of
administration but leave it off those that will be used in a simpler
way.

That said, I would DEFINITELY use and love the dropdowns if they were
already there, and I think that most people would enjoy them once they
got used to using WordPress.

I wholeheartedly agree with all of this. Thanks for taking the time to

I don't understand how anyone would benefit from rounding the numbers.
I don't think there is any need to change tag clouds at all unless
it's to make them more useful for bloggers and visitors.

Is it that you want the theme author to have the final word on tag
cloud font sizes?

Subject: [wp-hackers] RSS dump of posts and comments (separate). How can I
	import?
Message-ID: <5cdeb9b20801231606o47e6d9ecm85aae1951fff06ef@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

a friend of mine has had to export her wordpress (wpmu I think) from
the host http://blog381.com/ -- seems the person running it had a
fight with some guy (old story, didn't get details) and then required
that all the hosted bloggers remove any comments by him or links to
his blog, or she'd wipe their blog.

My friend turned to me for help, and as you can see here
http://flickr.com/photos/bunny/2215594546/ export had been disabled (a
couple of days ago, I'm told). I tried calling the URL directly, but
the script was gone.

So, I did a "last chance" export, as described here:
http://flickr.com/photos/bunny/2215581776/

Result: I have an RSS dump of all posts; I have an RSS dump of all comments.

I can import the RSS dump of posts into a wordpress.org install, then
export it in WXR format, and import it into wordpress.com -- works
happily.

What about the comments?

Are there any plugins that would allow to import that RSS dump of comments?
Or a plugin/script that would splice/convert the two RSS dumps into one WXR?

Added bonus: I did an HTML scrape to pick up all the photos -- I guess
there isn't any better solution than re-uploading them all and
changing all the URLs by hand? She'd uploaded them to her blog, so
they're in the uploads directory of the scrape.

Thanks for any help or pointers.

Steph

Sarcasm aside, this specific solution works in all browsers (well, i  
didn't test anything older then ie6).
It is not a standard drop down, rather it's structured quite like the  
current wp-admin navigation with navigation and sub navigation. the  
only difference is that if you hover over a top level navigation  
item, it shows it's sub navigation.
Also, I'm pretty sure that in oder browsers, the hovering won't work,  
but it will function just like the current admin navigation.
Nothing to loose. I'd take a look.

The commented text used for meta info about plugin came before the
loading of textdomain... few months ago we talked about a way to have
various lines of comments for various languages. so translators should
add new commnent line specifically targetted to a specific locale.. I
cant' find it now.. but if you serach here on on polyglots mailing
list you should find that discussion.

If I remeber correctly after the discussion didn't follow any real
implementation of this method...

This problem has interested me and I do think that if you send me the 
solution in that post, I might be able to create a patch.

1. From what I can think of, the solution might seem to be, either 
choosing the plugin file name by locale, so for German, it would be 
"pluginfilename_DE.php", however, this method is pretty terrible.

2. The second method would be to either have separate files, but with a 
new locale comment description which describes the locale. This will 
allow only choosing to load the correct plugin file by locale instead.

3. The third method extends the second and allows for placing all of the 
locale in the same file. So it extends upon the previous patch, where 
brackets are used, except that the parsing would be a little bit more 
slower and the locale would absolutely have to be before the description 
text.

/*
locale: en_US
plugin name:
version:

locale: de_??
plugin_name:
version
*/

That is all I can think of. Each one has its disadvantages. I think it 
would be neat to have an implementation for this problem. I'm willing to 
implement a solution, depending on the complexity.

I thought of something like this:

/*
Plugin Name: ...
Plugin URI: ....
Description: {de_??} Dies ist eine deutsche Beschreibung. {en_EN} This 
is an English description. {nl} Nederlandse taal.
Version: ...
*/

(or any other delimiter instead {...} like [...] or $...$ which are 
rarely used in descriptions)
This should be easy to parse, is quite intuitive, and you don't have to 
insert the description part more than once.

Another solution would be to place only the English description in the 
plugin header and the foreign descriptions in a single file and parse 
this file. This would keep the header clear:

/*
Plugin Name: ...
Plugin URI: ....
Description: This is an English description. {descriptions.lang}
Version: ...
*/

and the file description.lang:
{de_??}     Dies ist eine deutsche Beschreibung.
{en_EN}   This is an English description.
{nl, dut}     Nederlandse taal.

(or instead of defining the filename in the plugin header there may be a 
predefined filename).
Solution 1 and 2 are sub optimal since you are definitely violating the 
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and they're hard to maintain.

Lutz

BTW: Is this the correct list to discuss this topic or should we move 
somewhere else?)

Hmm, good question. I'm sure someone with more karma will say something,
if it is not. I think it would only be off topic if no implementation is
created.

However, you did give me an idea. Basically, it would be to add locale to
the description to the location (from the plugin description file base).

I think allowing for more than one way should be the best solution. So
instead of having your way or my way, I think I will try to implement both
ways.

The first way is as you say, have one description, and allow for '{' or
'[' and ']' or '}' respectively, to set the locale of the description,
plugin name, etc.

The second way would be to define the PHP file with the alternative plugin
headers, which will be loaded instead for that locale.

/*
Plugin name: ...
version: ...
description: ....
en_US: locale/en_US.php
de_??: locale/de_??.php
az_AZ: locale/az_AZ.php
 */

Execution Flow:

1. Pull in plugin locale file.
1.a. Get locale of WordPress installation.
1.b. Search for "locale:" in comment header.
1.c. If found then go to 1.d, if not found, then skip to 5.
1.d. Open and use that file and continue to 2

2. Find "Plugin Name:" and use text.
3. Find "Description:" and use text.
4. Find etc and use text.

(Basically just how it is now without any further checks for '{...}' or
'[...]' for the locale in the description. It will be assumed that the
locale file does not include any more locale information except the one
listed.)

5. Search for "Whatever:"
6. Search for "{az_AZ}", where az_AZ is the locale of the blog.
7. If found go to 8, if not found, go to 10.
8. Grab text after "{az_AZ}" and either until end of text or until
'{az_A2}' or '[az_A2]' is found.
9. Use text and go back to 5 until all text has been found.
10. If no [...] or {...} exists in text, then use all of text (assume
English) and go back to 5 for next text search else if text does exist,
then use en_US locale or first text before first {...} or [...].

An overview on how both methods can be implemented. Now to just code it
and after an implementation, complain to the commit team until it is in
core. I think it would be great, if this can finally be resolved in 2.5!

As I do have school, it might take some time... hmm. Actually give a few
hours and I should have something. I /should/ be doing homework, but okay,
this fascinates me more than like passing the class with an 'A'.

I like this solution. It keeps the header simple and readable.

By the way you'd need to be able to translate the plugin description of 
course, but also its name, and why not its URL for the (numerous) folks 
who maintain their custom plugin doc in more than one language.

+1 for me. This seems really clean, and won't break anything if that  
file is missing.

Maybe the optional file can be something like:

<lang:en_EN>
[...] the usual plugin header, translated
</lang>

<lang:it_IT>
<lang>

This way will be really easy to parse re-using the same function, just  
after identifying the right language, and so the right language  
block.... At least, it sounds good to me :-)

Subject: [wp-hackers] substitutes for hook wp_footer ?
Message-ID: <OFEA9FC548.E3DB5089-ONC12573DA.0055089E-C12573DA.005628FE@notes.edfgdf.fr>

Hello there

A long run question I think amongst plugin devs: is there a way you can 
make sure something has been triggered by, say, wp_footer hook?

If you want to be compatible with those pesky themes that miss their 
do_action('wp_footer')), would the following be acceptable ?

function myplugin_dostuff() {
        global $been_done;
        if ($been_done) return;
        // do stuff
        // ...
        $been_done = true;
}

add_action('wp_footer', 'myplugin_dostuff');
add_action('shutdown', 'myplugin_dostuff');

The obvious downside is that it would add output (like <script 
src="..."></script>) probably /after/ the closing </html> tag, but is 
there any better way to do things?

Thanks for any idea you'd have.

The solution using gettext that I proposed (if the email ever gets 
through) could also put the URL and the name in similar __() calls.

Again, I think any solution that uses a non-gettext method of 
translating the plugin information is problematic, because of all the 
locales out there.

I would love to read it. If it doesn't get through, then send it to me and
I'll see about implementing it along with the other suggestions. I think
the more options we give, the better.

During some internal debate (with myself), I came to the conclusion that
without a major refactor of the plugin system, it would be impossible to
use __().

The commit team does not seem keen on that solution or any solution which
involves hooks, and reloading of the plugin description. It will also have
to not have any major refactoring of how the plugin system functions.

One thing to consider is that locales are very very specific and there 
are a zillion of them. For instance, if you specify you have a 
description for en_EN, someone who uses locale en_US or en_CA could 
certainly read that description. Then again, for some languages, maybe 
the locale is important for understanding. The plugin author should 
not have to make a list of all possible locales for matching.

Given that, I don't like any of the suggestions so far proposed for 
providing descriptions in different languages. In my opinion, the 
matching scheme should somehow tie in to the POT/PO/MO/gettext 
internationalization scheme, not rely on matching the person's exact 
locale setting with a locale the plugin author decided to include a 
description for.

One possibility that could possibly be made to work is to put 
something like this into the plugin header:

/* Plugin Name: ...
    Description: Plugin to save the world
    (rest of header)
*/

$myplugin_desc = __( "Plugin to save the world" );

Now, the plugin description (as long as it is typed carefully the same 
in two spots) is part of the gettext scheme, and will be translated 
whenever the plugin is translated. The plugin listing page in the 
admin screen could try running the description through gettext before 
displaying it, and if that string has been translated in the MO file, 
it would get displayed in the user's preferred language.

How about that? The main pitfall would be that you have to remember, 
if you edit the description in the header, to put the same description 
into the $desc variable, so they stay in sync.

Well, the description in the header could be deprecated, and we could simply
start using the new method while retaining support for the old where the new
description is not available.

Your proposal is indeed smarter, but another pitfall is that plugins that 
are not activated wouldnt be translated since their plugindomain wouldnt 
load, which lacks some consistency IMO.

Hmm, your explanation makes a lot of sense. Seems awfully hackish though
(but I can get over it), but I'll see about implementing your idea. I will
also see about implementing the others, so that people can see which idea
is the "best" and choose for theirselves. I don't want to shun the other
ideas, because sometimes it is easier to just add the locale information
in a non-mo file.

In my experience, it seems very difficult to create .mo files and the
steps required are quite painful.

There will still need to be an optional extra header, for the directory of
the plugin text domain. Another issue is that you would have to add a
function which plugins can call to see if their plugin textdomain has
already been included. It could be assumed that the plugin textdomain is
the base plugin folder, however, the plugin_textdomain allows for choosing
the folder, so it will have to be supported in the plugin data also.

I think of the ideas, for those plugins that have translated (.mo) files,
it makes sense for them to use your method. For a simple plugin, it might
make more sense to use the other methods.

Your idea is a lot more simple, so I'm going to implement it first. Are
you willing to test the implementation?

This is the simplest solution, it's fully backward compatible, the
external file, if not created by authours that doens't care for I18N
(on plugins are lot less than in theme where 98% of theme are not
I18N) could be created by locale team, and as you said if the plugin
in locale is mantained in other sites these should be inserted in
locale translations.

The only problme I see about having alternative URL is version
management done by last WP version, i can have the XYZ plugin on my
locale site translated in italian at version 1.0 using this locale
version show up that there is a new version available but the one
people will download wont be the locale one (if exist) but an updated
version in english. It's true that plugin developper on worpress
repository often care a lot theyr products, managing locale version if
you send it to them etc.

The proposals were pretty similar to what is being discussed here. One
proposal leveraged gettext:

Introduce a new file called plugin_name-header.php.  Contents are
something like this:

$description = __('blah blah blah', 'plugin_name');
... for other fields

Or we would introduce some API methods instead of setting variables.
Doesn't really matter.  The plugin_name part of plugin_name-header.php
will be used as the textdomain.  WP loads the catalog for plugin_name
and then loads plugin_name-header.php.

Another proposal was to load plugin_name-lc_CC.txt files.  The file
would contain the plugin header translated for lc_CC.

The gettext method requires loading php files that might be broken,
thus allowing a plugin to break the manage plugins page even if it
isn't activated.  lc_CC.txt means lots of little files laying around
in addition to the .mo files.  Either way, we will need to figure out
how automatic upgrade of plugins will deal will locales.

Another proposal was to do it in the style of GNOME and KDE desktop files:

Description: In English
Description[es]: En Espa?ol

That can get pretty unwieldy though.

Created patch for gettext implementation. Will upload later. Have class.
Will need testers, because I can't and won't create .mo files for it. Will
test to make sure it works before I upload.

Will implement second set of suggestions later.

Translating plugin name will break update notification (automatic
upgrade?), so plugin name won't be translated but Title can be.

I think we use the filename, not the plugin name.  We match against
the directory and file names in the svn repo.

The article that includes that example is a good read for anyone working on
this:  http://24ways.org/2006/marking-up-a-tag-cloud

Anything that changes the size of the text (even in a relative fashion)
means that the markup is no longer semantic.  It's not the end of the world,
but it'd be nice to follow best practices.

Tag clouds most commonly use various font sizes, but I've also seen tag
clouds that change other properties (color) and multiple properties (font
weight, size, color).

I might be able to help out with the images problem --

There is a "Find and Replace" plugin that goes through your database  
(using direct MySQL calls, IIRC).  You might dump all the images into  
one directory, and then figure out a way to replace all existing  
image paths (within posts only!) with the one new one.  You're losing  
whatever organization might have existed, but it would probably be a  
lot easier than remaking a whole directory structure....

Plugin:

Hope it helps.

I've found they are quite easy to deal with if you use Poedit.

1) Open .pot or .po file.
2) Edit or add translations as needed.
3) Save.  .mo file is automatically created on save of .po

<http://www.poedit.net/>


Regarding the overall issue of localizing plugin descriptions -- I  
think any viable solution would _have_ to be able to use the  
normal .mo file.  This is most likely going to require a few changes  
to core.  Having a whole extra set of language files (or one loooong  
one with "all" translations would be a bear to maintain, especially  
when there is already a localization system in place!

Primarily, yes.  There is no reason the font sizes should be  
programatically hard-coded.  Your way, changing these sizes would  
require me to hack the core.  My way would require one line of CSS.

Would it be a problem to have WordPress check the .mo file for a translation
string for the description field?  That seems like the simplest solution to
me, but I haven't really researched it.

Ryan, thanks for the tip.

I've been running the fix on a few sites with no problems so far, and  
much, much better performance on the site with the over-sized posts  
table. Trac ticket #5717 addresses the issue and includes my diff:

While people are hashing out this suggestion, how about doing it for themes
as well?

Because then you're limiting it to *explicit sizes*. What if I don't
want to use sizes?
What if I want to use colors?
What if I want to use underlining or emphasis?
What if I want to use absolute position on the page?

By limiting the "cloud" to size, you're limiting it to what you think
a cloud should be. Also, you're putting actual styling information
into the content itself, instead of semantic information which can
have styling applied to it.

There is a physical limit no matter how you look at it. Your use of an
unbounded set has a limitation as well, that being the limitation of
the floating point value. You also have destructive rounding problems
as well. This is all in addition to an inability to adjust the display
of your cloud without hacking the core code or ceasing to use that
core code entirely.

Okay now you're just being silly. Do you seriously think that your
display is even capable of rendering a font size all the way down to
the 5th decimal place? Or that your browser is capable of calculating
it? Frankly, I'd be shocked if the browser rendered even one decimal
place and didn't just trunc the numbr to the int value anyway.

That's not a benefit, it's a downside. Again, I like the idea of using
color instead of size.

I'll give you this one. But an theme defined set of tagcloud-X classes
is easy to understand too.

Let's say you used tagcloud-X classes. You don't need a lower limit,
just use 1 for X. The upper limit can be defined by the call to the
tagcloud creation function, but it can default to some useful value,
like 10 or so. This puts not only the rounding level within the
control of the theme creator, but the display parameters as well. Your
method gives neither to the theme creator, all they can do is specify
size bounds.

I don't follow you. Sure, your font-size is adjustable via javascript,
but so is any form of CSS you like. The class values are well
available and easy to manipulate via javascript. Also, your idea
*requires* javascript to manipulate the display. Ours just requires
CSS to manipulate it, javascript would only be required to manipulate
it on the client side.

The way it is is not only awful, it's non-semantic and completely
against the whole point of separation of the style from the content.

Why would it rule? I will reiterate my position that you gain nothing
when you replace rational numbers with classes.

In the example above, the "somewhat popular" class makes all these
values indistinguishable: 44=52=67=85=72. "Ironbridge" (85) is almost
twice as popular as "125 Shaftesbury Avenue" (44) yet they are the
same size.

I do like that the markup includes the values in spans for screen
readers. But why would yo want to cripple visual readers by reducing
the data resolution to six size classes?

This looks to me like semantics/presentation zeal gone overboard.
There is no semantic equivalent for numbers. They are pure values in
themselves.

If you believe that adding explicit sizes to a tag cloud destroys the
markup's semantic purity, you should check your premise. Are you
trying to help the user? The user is not helped when you destroy the
key idea of a tag cloud, which is this: to convey relative value
differences by VISUAL cues. You can assist the non-visual reader
without hurting the experience for the rest of us.

Now I'm going to counter my own argument by providing an example of
what I believe is the utmost semantic representation of a tag cloud.
http://skeltoac.com/examples/list2cloud.html

Future versions of CSS3 may provide functions to accomplish the same
thing, but that could be ten years away.

Still, I don't think we gain anything by using classes instead of
rational numbers!

OK, I have a dumb question. If I want to test this patch (and I do!), 
is there an easy way to download it as a plain text patch file? When I 
go to the bug report and view the patch, or try to save the file, I 
get an HTML page. Which is not so easy to use to patch Trunk and test...

At the risk of being a blowhard by stating the obvious, I thought the
point of separation of style and content was to write less markup and
be as compatible as possible.

In this case the least markup required is DEFINITELY with the
non-semantic solution, and as Andy said, there is really no risk to
actual users (disabled or otherwise) that isn't at least as bad as the
wonky CSS hacks being proposed to make it 'semantic'.

 Most importantly, this is definitely not worth breaking any templates
over! If a semantic version of the cloud is added it should be by
making it an option inside wp_generate_tag_cloud(), or else adding a
whole new function and letting the hardcore designers use that
instead.

 If 2.5 Kubrick uses the optional semantic option in the function and
accompanying CSS then great, people can switch their themes and use
the Kubrick CSS as a starting point. But incombatibilitating (ha ha
ha) all themes that don't have the semantic CSS classes set up is
obviously not even close to worth it.

This isn't perfect by any means... li value is deprecated.

I was reminded a few minutes ago that I have always hated tag clouds.
I jumped in because I am a data guy and I hate seeing good data go to
waste but I don't use tag clouds so it doesn't matter to me how you
mark them up. I withdraw. As you were. :-)

Indirectly, yes. The user is helped by visual cues, however the "user"
is not necessarily a person. It could be an automated system or some
other kind of parser. It could be javascript code in the page itself.
The markup should not be primarily leaned towards the visual aspect
because my "user" may not have eyes.

Yes. Because you can make the markup non-visual in nature and then use
CSS to transform that into a visual representation.

I do like the idea of values being used in LI elements. Good use of
them. Although I'd use a UL. Still...

No need for CSS3. CSS2 can do it (with attribute selectors), but
current browsers mostly can't handle it.

Like this:
li[value="25"] { font-size: 125% }

Try it. That works in Firefox, probably IE7 too.

Can't do it that way. What about feeds? They don't call the wp_footer.

I think that you probably shouldn't try to compensate for bad theme design.

On the other hand, if you have a config screen, you could search the
currently active theme's footer.php file for the "wp_footer" text and
warn the user if the theme doesn't have it. Bit of a long way to go,
but it would work.

Firstly apologies for starting a new thread but the old one has grown a
bit and I want to try and refocus the discussion a bit.

We have a number of issues with the theme and plugin metadata at the moment:

1. You can't localise it. (#3089)
2. It can cause fatal errors due to things like file size etc. (#5651).

Therefore I think it might be time for a step change:

Come up with a new way of storing and presenting the metadata that fixes
these issues.

We would then support both methods of providing the metadata for a few
releases and then cut over to only supporting the new version (probably
providing a plugin to provide any backwards compatibility shims to allow
old plugins to still be used if they had not been updated).

Think of this like moving from the old wp-hacks to the current plugin
system.  Its possibly a big step but it can allow us to learn from the
experience.

By making this step change we can implement strick rules to govern the
formatting and provide a more reliable and performant process.

Some goals for the implementation:

1. Provide the ability for plugin/theme meta data to be translated.
2. Seperate the meta-data from the rest of the plugin/theme.
3. Combine the parsing code used for plugins and themes.
4. Allow for extensible metadata.

Requirements:

1. Use gettext so as to integrate with the rest of a plugins translation.
2. Protect against malformed plugins breaking the admin with PHP errors.

Possible Solution:

1. Plugins have to be stored within a folder under PLUGINDIR.
2. All plugins have a metadata.php file.
3. metadata.php file is included by the admin plugin page (not in global
scope to keep it clean) as a way of discovering the available plugins.

Example metadata.php file:

<?php

load_plugin_textdomain();

register_plugin( plugin_filename.php,
~                 __('Description'),
~                 __('Plugin Name'),
~                'http://example.com',
~                'Joe Bloggs',
~                 'http://joe.bloggs.name'),);

//The End
?>

What do people think?

No, in fact, that's not the point of semantic markup at all. The point
is to make the markup have actual inherent meaning beyond the
displaying of the content.

If I write <b>bolded text</b>, then that's less meaningful than
<strong>bolded text</strong>. The b tag is describing how to display
the text, the strong tag is assigning a meaning to that text, that it
should be strongly emphasized and, to some degree, is more important
than the other text. Even though they display the same (by default),
the b is not semantic, the strong is.

If I define a div with a class, then that class should be meaningful
in and of itself. I'm marking that entire division of content as some
type of thing. That thing should not be layout related, it should be
content related. If I say that a div holds my sidebar content, then
the sidebar doesn't necessarily have to be on the side of the page. It
can be anywhere, the point is that that content is fundamentally
different from, say, my posts (which are often called "content" in
div's). Ideally, you'd only mark divs up based on the content. Sadly,
browsers sometimes require us to use a bit more of them than required
for layout reasons.

But the idea is that everything in the XHTML should be descriptive of
ONLY what is in the XHTML. It doesn't depend on any outside thing.
Sure, you can use CSS to display it in different ways (and I do just
that on my site with extra print.css and handheld.css files), but the
markup itself should be describing the content it surrounds, not how
to display it or how to do anything else with it.

These "hacks" are not wonky. They're the whole point. You want to
describe the content itself. How you actually display that content
should not be in the XHTML at all.

I'm all for backward compatibility, just allow me to specify some
option to remove the idiotic style tags entirely and use proper CSS
classes. I don't really care if they are the default options for the
function or not, although they darn well should be, IMO.

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to determine install version of MySQL?


The conversation here awhile back regarding SQL queries brought up an  
issue that I have with a my archive filter plug-in. To filter the the  
archives I am using a query similar to the one in wp_get_archive.  
However, there is a subquery that I use to limit the posts to those  
included (or excluded) from specified categories. Since WP supports  
older versions of MySQL that do not support subqueries, the plug-in  
would not work.

Is there a hook/method that I could use to not allow the plug-in to  
be activated unless MySQL is v5 or better?

Thanks,

[still talking about this, feel free to ignore if you don't like
markup-semantics chit-chat]

Yeah, I'm aware of what semantic means (though for the sake of having
an excellent definition of semantic markup in this thread, thanks for
spelling it out for everyone).

I was saying that "the separation of style and content", which you
said is antithetical to the current tag cloud function, and which is
NOT the same thing as semantic markup, has as one of it's primary
goals the reduction of markup and the compaitbility of content across
platforms.

To construe hard-line semantic markup (which I find sexy, exciting and
worthwile almost all of the time) as being the same thing as "using
web standards" or "seperating style from content" I think is to miss
the point of why the latter things are popular and held in high
regard, and I think it's an undertone of this conversation. Standards
and style-free content are extremely useful on a practical level,
semantics is far more theoretical in its utility.

I'm saying that when your strict (doctype or otherwise) adherence to
semantic/standard/seperated markup principles butts up against
practical reality, you have to ask yourself why you are on the
standards boat in the first place, and that in some cases you have to
recognize that you're working against the most important goals (less
code, more coder hapiness) in favor of the more trivial ones (platonic
perfection of your markup expression).

That said, in this case it is worth going for a semantic solution if
the complexity of the CSS can be kept at a minimum (i.e. avoid
anything that involves mandatory relative sizing).

Now who wants to write a patch that allows both methods of cloud creation?

ps: One correction to your solution is that you need to call 
__('text','domain') in the plugin metadata file. Also, the other 
submitted patch to that ticket also gettexted the URL, author name, etc.

Yes. This meets those concerns.

When creating a gettext po file, we search the source for __() and
_e() and extract the strings within them.  Strings meant for
translation must be within __() or _e() somewhere in the source.  If a
plugin's files don't do __() or _e() on the metadata strings, those
strings won't be available for translation lookups.

Doing __($variable) will result in the literal string "$variable"
showing up in the po file.  We don't want that.

Right. But the trac ticket's patch doesn't address that concern; just 
the explanation of how to set up a plugin file was incorrect.

No problem, your stuff is good enough to validate a new thread.

Damn, I knew there was some reason you couldn't use variables, but I
totally forgot what the reason was. I think your suggestion is quite a
good one, but I disagree with one point.

Wait, the variables weren't supposed to be translated. I suppose I should
have just used translate function instead of __().

> 2. It can cause fatal errors due to things like file size etc. (#5651).

Yeah, you know. I fixed both of those issues. Well, yeah, it would be good
to start a topic on why those fixes weren't committed. I don't know about
the patch, or like, WTF, but yeah, I tested those issues and they work for
me.

You've done a really good job cleaning up my last patch, so I'm unsure
whether or not you're doing the same for the current patches. However, it
would be nice to know, if the patch doesn't meet your standards, so that I
could work with you on those issues.

I think, #3141 would solve the memory issue and reduce the support tickets
for this problem a great deal. Let me know what I can do to correct any
issues with #3141 and #5651. I was hoping to get them in before I stopped
having a lot of time, but I'll make the exception for those two and #3089.

Makes sense. This pretty much goes along with number two, because each
plugin would have to exist in their own folder. It would also simplify the
code, if number two was also used.

> 2. All plugins have a metadata.php file.

Lets call it something else, so we can use it for more than just metadata.
See below.

> 3. metadata.php file is included by the admin plugin page (not in global
> scope to keep it clean) as a way of discovering the available plugins.

I would suggest, that 1) we allow for single file (php) files to exist in
the PLUGINDIR root, which we can assume that they are their own plugin and
allow for register_plugin() to exist within that single file.

If there is only one (php) file in directories above PLUGINDIR, then we
can assume that it holds the register_plugin() function.

The reason I suggest this, is that there are too many plugins which exist
in one file anyway, so it would be unreasonable to restrict them.
WordPress 2.5 would go from hundreds of plugins to only a handful. Not
progress in my opinion, even if we provide backwards compatibility.

We also don't want to over complicate plugin authors, if they want to have
just one file, then let them. There is nothing wrong with have simple
plugins contained in one file, and there is nothing wrong with optimizing
plugins and combining many files into one.

I would suggest, that plugin authors that have their plugins contained in
one directory, that they use a library directory for their plugin. That is
to say, that for plugins that I write, the file that contains the metadata
already does contain the metadata and I'm just including other files.
Don't force me to create another file in the root that does the same
thing. If there is already one PHP file, then assume that it contains the
metadata.

I do suggest that metadata be required if it exists, but this can only be
done if there is only one PHP file in the directory. If there is more than
one, then assume that it is using the comment metadata and do not include
it if it isn't valid. This will allow for extra features to be included
eventually, even if it isn't included in 2.5, at least it can get into 2.6
and slow deprecate the old style.

I like it and will begin working on it, I'm sure someone else is probably
doing so, but I think with something this big, it would be good to have
two or more solutions to throw around and pick and choose the best one.

However, I don't believe, that if you have just metadata.php, that it
should be restricted to just metadata. I would suggest that you include
install and uninstall information and add that into the feature set. Why
have one file for just metadata, when you can register install and
uninstall info also?

I would also suggest that if we had a required file, that we can add more
stuff, like registering configuration pages and simplify that process as
well.

Lets clean up a lot of tickets and just go crazy. I've been waiting for
this moment and it would make adding new features a lot easier. If I do go
crazy, hopefully, the ticket will be included.

I'm not sure how much work you already put into this, but I'll be up to
working on an implementation over the weekend, including tonight and
tomorrow.

$source = file_get_contents(THEMEPATH . '/footer.php');
if( strpos($source, 'wp_footer') === false ) {
//No footer action in theme
}

Or similar.. Very easy to accomplish, but something you'd only want to do once on the admin page(and once the theme changes)

Subject: [wp-hackers] wordpress.org plugin problem
Message-ID: <47993DFC.5030808@ezdispatch.com>

I submitted some requests to put some of my plugins onto wordpress.org.  
One was denied, and I was told to "Please make this a core patch on 
Trac" which I did: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5662.  The other 
five were all approved on Jan 13th 2008.  I tagged and checked in two of 
my plugins (along with readme.txt files) on Jan 14th 
(http://svn.wp-plugins.org/authenticate/ and 
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/attachment-manager/).  For a day or so, 
nothing happened, and I assumed some sort of additional approval was 
being run.  Eventually people that used those plugins started getting 
links telling them to upgrade, but they would get 404s when they 
followed the links.  As of yesterday, the links now work 
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/authenticate/ and 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/attachment-manager/) but my profile 
still shows nothing 
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/profile/aaroncampbell), and none of 
the descriptions or FAQs are showing up on the plugin pages.  I'm 
assuming I've done something wrong, but could someone lot me know what 
that is?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Widget Coding Standard
Message-ID: <47996120.8060704@santosj.name>

Is there some reason why widget coders place the widget display code in 
the widget initialize function? I was contemplating that and came to the 
conclusion that someone, Person A, decided it would be cool to place 
functions inside of functions like a closure, because they could. I 
believe that Person B, while trying to learn how to write widgets 
decided that the idea was cool and probably that was how it worked and 
copied the idea.

As many widgets (I've seen three, but those are pretty good odds that 
enough people are infected with this idea, but not enough to get the 
full picture of how many coders actually do this), as I've seen, I think 
the idea is great, but should be shun in practice.

At some point, PHP might (unlikely, but granted there are patches that 
allow this, so it might be a matter of time), at some point implement 
true closure support and woohoo, the widgets will magically stop working 
on that PHP version.

The way it works now, is that PHP sees the function declaration and 
pulls the function to the global space and compiles it. If the patches 
are applied, then the function will be created anonymously to the widget 
init function and gain the variable scope of the parent function. This 
is probably not so bad, in and of itself, because most widget init 
functions don't do much, except register the widget display function.

The question I have is, why are so many widget developers using this 
method? PHP allows it and will continue to allow it, but the widget 
display functions are not closures and should not be developed in such a 
way that they are. The only thing it prevents is the compilation of the 
function until the init function is called. I do not believe there is 
any difference between compiling it when the file is pulled in by PHP 
and during runtime when PHP sees that the function needs to be compiled. 
The function will still exist around the same time.

Does anyone have any rebuttal or authority to tell these people to stop? 
I know you can't prevent them, but I plan to write about it and right 
now I'll very much sound like an ass. I don't wish to, because I already 
sound like one in this email.

And if the theme doesn't sport a footer.php? Yes most do, but it's not a 
required template.

Well you'd add a check in first to see if the file exists.. But that was just to show how its done -- i woudn't do something like that.
Shoot the theme author if its a problem, and tell your users who have the problem to edit their theme i guess.

I don't think it's necessary to put all this complexity into the  
plugins themselves!

Look, we could leave the metadata exactly where and as it is, with  
one addition:

Text Domain: myplugin

The additional functionality should be added _once_, in core, instead  
of in each plugin.  Doing this will avoid issues of having to  
"upgrade" plugins.  In the core function that parses the Metadata, it  
would look for the presence of the "Text Domain" string.  If present,  
it would load that text domain, and then pass each meta string  
through __() with that domain.

A few lines of code in core, one line added to plugins following the  
new system, and NO incompatibilities with older plugins.

What's not to like?

Stephen

Hi,

Stephens solution has a bunch of advantages:
- is pretty simple
- does the job 
- should be fairly easy to add to the existing code
- does not cause any incompatibilities with older plugins
- avoids that any plugin code is executed if the plugin is inactive. With
the original solution from Peter, for each plugin - although it may be
inactive - at least one file would be executed by the PHP parser and may
cause compile or execution errors

I like it. Thumb up

Regards
S?ren

I think this is an excellent solution.  It seems very future proof, too.

A plugin could also use _c().  And when another gettext function is
created in the future, any code scanning the source for them would need
to be updated again to keep this kind of heuristics working correctly.

Sounds neat & simple, but how does the plugin author add the required

Indeed. I was never on intending on pushing a step change into 2.5.

I just want to make sure we think of the bigger picture rather than just
patching what we have with an inelegant solution.

| What's not to like?
|

The main issue here is that the strings will not make it into the
plugins catalogue file automatically - the php file is parsed looking
for the __() calls and the string passed in makes it to the catalogue file.

It would also mean without adding a new translation function in the core
for these strings the variable names will end up in the WordPress
catalogue file.

These changes are however working around the fact that extracting the
metadata from the php file without loading it is a hard problem - lots
of pattern matching when a simple function call would be much better.

Some design improvements below after sleeping on the idea.

Rather than a metadata.php file we move back to single file plugins.

When we are discovering plugins we define('WP_PLUGIN_DISCOVER',true);
the simple plugin file my_plugin.php which is in the root PLUGINDIR becomes:

<?php

load_plugin_textdomain();

register_plugin( __FILE__,
~                 __('Description'),
~                 __('Plugin Name'),
~                'http://example.com',
~                'Joe Bloggs',
~                 'http://joe.bloggs.name'),);

if ( !(defined('WP_PLUGIN_DISCOVER') )
{
	//All plugin code goes here including includes.
}

//The End
?>

You can still use a folder and a metadata.php if you want.

It's only an optimistic assumption: the .po compiler hopefully does not
care about whether a string is inside of PHP comments or not as long a as
the string matches the .po's search condition (which usually is '__' and
'_e' at the moment). I haven't verfied this yet.

Therefore the description string can be encapsulated into a pseudo PHP
function call and so will be recognized by the .po compiler. An example
would look like:

/*
Plugin Name: Blah
Version: 2.0.2
Plugin URI: http://example.com
Author: Me
Author URI: http://example.com
Description: __("My super duper plugin")
Text Domain: myplugin
*/

The encapsulating __(" ") needs to be stripped away by the WP core before
it accesses the gettext functions with the description string. One
downside of this solution is, that even the strings of inactive plugins
will be loaded this way.

I agree with Peter Westwood that this solution also requires a third
translation function for the WP core to avoid that for these strings the
variable names will end up in the WordPress catalogue file.

One thing i dont like about all these suggestions is having an extra file to rely on that will be automatically loaded..

I like this solution though, Kind of, However it could work rather ok.

Rather than defining a value, any good plugin shouldnt do any install actions on anything other than the activation hook, So what i'm thinking is maybe there needs to be a discovery mode, where no init/activation/etc hooks are run, only discovery hooks/actions are run.

So instead:
* Plugins page is loaded, Notices that there are plugins which it has not seen before
  * Redirects to a discovery page instead(Note: This is NOT done inline with the usual admin interface for a reason -- We dont want a failed plugin, or a plugin silently modifying the admin page while its loaded) 
  * Redirection is placed for redirecting back to plugins page afterwards(incase plugin fails to load, or does something stupid and unexpected)
  * Discovery page includes the plugin file
  * Discovery page does NOT run admin_init/init/activate hooks, nothing that a plugin should attach itself to currently
  * Discovery page runs a hook "discovery_<plugin_file>"
  * Plugin hooks onto discovery:

<?php
/*
* Meta: Data Still here as normal as a back-fall
*
*/

add_action('init','example_init');
function example_init(){
//modify wordpress behaviour
}

if( function_exists('register_plugin_discovery') ){
   register_plugin_discovery(__FILE__,'example_discovery');
   //Or For those people who do not want to wrap it in a function exists call and retain backwards compatibility:
   // add_action('discovery_' . __FILE__, 'example_discovery');
   function example_discovery(){
	load_plugin_textdomain();
	register_plugin( __FILE__,
		__('Description'),
		__('Plugin Name'),
		'http://example.com',
		'Joe Bloggs',
		'http://joe.bloggs.name');
	//Other things which could be used for feature creep in peoples minds, but shouldnt be implemented
	register_plugin_requirement('PHP','5');
	register_plugin_coniguration_page('options','example plugin');
	
}}

?>
  * Repeat for any more plugins that were also found, assuming no errors have occured yet..
  * Discovery complete, Information needed saved, Hopefully no changes were made to WP. 
  * Redirection takes place back to plugins page (maybe ?discovery=success atthis point to show it went right through)
 * Plugins page is loaded again, Any translated stuff is shown.

Is there any stats on the current spread of English vs. Localised versions of wordpress out there?
How about the number of plugins which currently have translations available?



I apologise to those people who i've just repeated.

I tried that already, but at least xgettext knows about the syntax of
the language (it is, after all, told about it being PHP).  It happily
skips comments.  I'd expect PoEdit to behave similarly (but maybe it
doesn't -- I haven't tested that).

My second thought was to extract the Plugin Name and Description fields
from the comment header and manually craft a pot (po) snippet that would
be merged with the other strings using the merge option to xgettext.
However, I didn't have time to write the script.  (And it would be UNIX-
centric if I wrote it.)

The "put more burden on the plugin author" approach would be to ask the
authors to duplicate the comments within __() calls inside some never
called code.  Mind you, if the plugin has an admin page, then its name
at least probably already gets translated (sort of by accident, though).

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

Hello guys

I don't get how is_feed() is supposed to work. Consider the following
in a plugin:

add_action('init', 'breakfeed');
function breakfeed() {
	if (is_feed()) die('moo');
}

I wasn't able to get the breakfeed() function triggered:
site.com/feed/, site.com/wp-feed.php etc work as usual.

What am I missing ?

podpress does it, as far as I can remember. it checks for wp_head and  
wp_footer, but I can't find where in its code, at least after a quick  
read..

I say, I think after Matt's announcement, we are going about it slightly 
off.

I think we should fix the current localization issues with the current 
base, since both issues have patches which with a few slight 
modifications can fix the issues for 2.5. The current discussion can 
make it into 2.6, and by the time that happens, probably will have an 
awesome solution.

The patch for #3089, only needs to have all __() functions switched to 
translate(), so that it doesn't pollute the WordPress catalog. The 
current patch by Hodgdon works, except for that one issue. Once that fix 
is committed, it will remove that ticket from our minds for 2.5 and we 
can move on implementing a better way in 2.6.

The patch for #5651, only needs to be completed and should reduce the 
memory load on big single file plugins. Add in the fix for #3141, and 
you have the recipe for something that fixes three central issues, two 
with memory usage and one with localization of plugins. I think it would 
make 2.5 even better than it already is and will mean a lot to those 
that use the features.

However, since they have patches and have been partially tested, I think 
it would be better to get the fixes in to 2.5, where it won't make a lot 
of changes to the core and think about moving on for 2.6. I look forward 
to having the new proposal in  2.6 (hopefully it is implemented in 2.6). 
We really should be looking at 2.5 and what we can do for it on 
this/these issues.

"init" is too early.  Try "template_redirect" for the action hook.

At "init," everything is loaded, but the actual parsing of the feed
query---when WP_Query sets is_feed to true---hasn't taken place yet.
That will happen when the wp function is called.

I just tested it.  In Poedit, the strings are _not_ automatically  
imported.

It's not hard to add them manually to an existing .po file, but it is  
an extra step and kind of a pain to maintain....  Dang it.

...But no less a pain than maintaining a second copy of every thing  
in a special metadata file.

The easiest solution to this is to add a line just *under* the comment 
setting the text to variables, e.g.:

$desc = __("My super duper plugin", "myplugin");

Then POEdit will find the strings. I tested this yesterday with the 
patch to

We've come back around to what was said at the beginning. :-)

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3089#comment:18

That plus calling translate() instead of __() in the manage plugins
page to avoid WP catalog pollution will work.  Ugly as hell, but it
will work.  Care would have to be taken to make sure the strings in
the plugin header match what is in __() exactly, new lines and all.

Message-ID: <cc3bc5c70801251010q1f24f3cdse0f4bd01ec9f15bc@mail.gmail.com>

Just an FYI to plugin developers.

The Calais Application ( part of Reuters ) has a $5,000 bounty for a
WordPress plugin.

Details: http://opencalais.mashery.com/page/bountyprogram
----------------------------
Here's the basic concept: A highly configurable plugin for WordPress that
enriches a blog with several capabilities

    * Tag auto suggestion: Using the content of the blog entry the plugin
will provide a list of suggested semantic tags. For example, if the post
talks about company "a" buying company "b" the plugin would suggest
"Acquisition", "Company A" and "Company B" as potential tags
    * Semantic cloud: We all love tag clouds and we'd like to take it a step
further. The plugin should support the generation of a configurable semantic
tag cloud of entities and facts derived from the blog's content
    * GUID Incorporation: The Calais web service returns a Globally Unique
Identifier (GUID) for each document submitted. The plugin should modify the
RSS feed for the site to incorporate the GUID in a TBD location.

As long as the plugin puts in its own text domain name, why would 
calling __() pollute the main catalog?

The call to __($variable_name) in the WordPress code will end up with

I am not comfortable with introducing one solution for localisation now
when we are already talking about replacing it with something better.

I think we would do better to push the localisation of metadata for
plugins (and themes) out to 2.6 so that we can develop a good all-round
solution.

Introducing localisation for this metadata is going to cause work for
plugin and theme authors to make use of it.  We do not want to give them
more work by changing how it works in the next version - we do better to
do it once in a way that works best and we are going to support forever.

Optimising the current code for less memory usage and better performance
is good for 2.5.

Yeah, we already established you can't use variable names. The plan 
would be:

/*
    Description: My great plugin that you need.

(rest of header)
*/

$mydomain_desc = __("My great plugin that you need.", "mydomain" );

Again, how will that pollute anything?

That code is fine from a plugins catalog point of view.

The problem is code like this is the current patch on #3089:

$description[1] = __(trim($description[1]), $text_domain);

This would be in the core WordPress code - and so the text within the
__() call would end up in the WordPress catalogue

We're going to get wild and crazy and bump our PHP requirement to 4.3.
 Some 4.3 specific functions crept into 2.3.x, so we already have
dependencies on it.

No, we're not going to require 4.4 or 5.  4.3 for this release, and
then we'll see about further bumps down the line.

And now I duck and cover for the inevitable PHP 5 thread.  :-)

Message-ID: <70088.27189.qm@web52906.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm replacing the title of a post to be a combination of two custom fields if they are present, e.g. artist "title". Generally, it is possible to get the id in the 'the_title' hook by:

        $post = &get_post();
        $id = $post->ID;

Now, this does not work on the Latest Activity box on the Dashboard (2.3.2) -- does anyone know how to (always) get the id of the post that the_title() or get_the_title() refers to using the 'the_title' action? Seems to me like there isn't enough context for this action.

Cheers,
Henrik.

Isn't $post a global at that point?

global $post;
$id = $post->ID;

That should work.

This bugs me because such redundancy is best avoided.  I've been  
pondering it, and here's an idea:  DON'T repeat.  If a header string  
has a localization, _only_ put it in the __() line.  The new core  
code would look for one or the other, and if it finds something in  
the __() line, it would not be needed in the header comment.

/*
Plugin Name: My Plugin
Plugin URI: http://example.com/myplugin/
Version: 1.0
Author: Stephen Rider
Author URI: http://example.com/
Text Domain: myplugin
*/
$loc_Description = __("My great plugin that you need.", "wpplugin" );

It would have to be there for any plugins requiring backwards  
compatibility, but after a while the redundancy could be dropped  
entirely.

Note also in the example:

1) A new special domain of "wpplugin".  This would trigger a minor  
fork in the normal __() function telling it to use the found "Text  
Domain" string, _and_ to not add it to the WP catalog.  (Otherwise we  
_can_ just use a different function -- just bouncing ideas here!)

2) _Any_ of the metadata strings can be localized by turning it into  
a variable name $loc_ + metadata name -- e.g. $loc_Plugin_Name or  
$loc_Plugin_URI

Isn't that is essentially the same as &get_post, which works fine for the 'Recent Posts' bit, but not for 'Recent Comments'. For the comments, the id of the post is stored in $comment and is passed  as get_the_title($comment->comment_post_ID). So, I could make $comment global too, and get the ID from there, but there's not enough context to tell if we're looping through $posts or $comments. 

Does that make sense?

Isn't $post a global at that point?

global $post;
$id = $post->ID;

That should work.

We're going to get wild and crazy and bump our PHP requirement to 4.3.
 Some 4.3 specific functions crept into 2.3.x, so we already have
dependencies on it.

No, we're not going to require 4.4 or 5.  4.3 for this release, and
then we'll see about further bumps down the line.

And now I duck and cover for the inevitable PHP 5 thread.  :-)

Ah, thanks, thought so.

So, for this reason, shouldn't the id be available to the 'the_title' action? As it stands now, all one can do is to format the existing title.

Hi -

I'm trying to write a simple plugin on the lines of Matt's no-www (
http://photomatt.net/2006/06/13/wordpress-no-www/ ).

For a site: mysite.com, the idea is to make m.mysite.com redirect to:

http://www.google.com/reader/m/view/feed/http://mysite.com/feed/atom

But it doesn't seem to work. Appreciate if someone could take a look
at the code below and tell me what's wrong with it:

<?php

if ( !strstr( $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], 'm.' ) )
return;

header('HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently');
header('Location: http://www.google.com/reader/m/view/feed/' .
substr($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], 2) . 'feed/atom');
exit();

?>

Thanks,

Not for another 8 months at least, then the inevitable PHP5 thread will 
commence. Until then, I will bide my time, dreaming of what will never 
come in 8 months or 10 months or probably not even 12 months.

Some of my immense hatred for WordPress has been relieved, as XML DOM 
can now be used (except for the sour fact that DOM for PHP 5 would also 
have to be supported if XML DOM is used. Sigh, XML is so much easier in 
PHP 5, but that is neither here nor now). XML DOM is fairly decent in 
its XML support and I have been itching to write patches that used it to 
replace the way it is currently done. Writing compatibility layer XML 
code is fascinating and something I look forward to hopefully getting in 
to replace the current method of XML.

This also opens up a whole list of PHP functions that would otherwise 
have to be avoided. So I do look forward to the outlook of code that 
uses PHP 4.3 to the fullest!

Dude, I'm so totally going to love not going to school in the Fall. I 
just hope you guys accept my crazy, insane ideas during the Summer and 
Fall. I can't wait to dive back into XML DOM and debate the issue on 
whether it should be used to replace what is done now.

Message-ID: <479AAD08.9040101@santosj.name>

Hmm, I think we both agree that the new way is totally awesome. I just 
have to once again disagree, but let me explain.

I don't think the current way is going to be replaced. It would be crazy 
to go from hundreds, if not thousands of plugins to only a handful, as 
I've stated before. Therefore, it makes logical sense that the current 
method will be supported for the next few versions. Given WordPress 
awesome backwards compatibility record, I don't believe the current 
method is going anywhere within the next few versions. Perhaps you are 
going to deprecate it, but it seems illogical and unreasonable to 
completely remove it.

I don't believe it is going to be removed, but I have no authority on 
that matter, you do! However, I'm sure you'll see the reasoning. Right 
now there is a chance to fix it for WordPress 2.5, and let me explain.

1. The patch is simple, should not cause any huge problems, once the 
issues are addressed and trust me by this weekend they will be. The 
counter to this is that by adding this feature, WordPress will then have 
to support it and supply fixes for something that is going to be 
eventually deprecated. That I can understand. However, I would suggest 
that any major defects be marked as "won't fix" until the next solution 
is implemented.
2. The patch will get plugin developers ready for the eventual improved 
solution, which also uses gettext. So you have a fix for WordPress 2.5 
that uses gettext and to the user, it will appear to be a bump up in an 
already established feature.
3. We don't have an implementation right now that replaces the current 
behavior. My interest is almost diminished to be honest, so I'm unsure 
if I will devote time to a project that won't see the light of day until 
probably June or July. That is only if it is completed by April. If an 
implementation is not completed by April, then it is unlikely that it 
will get into 2.6, so it will be skipped to 2.7. By then interest will 
be completely diminished and as there probably won't be a huge interest 
in this feature, it may completely die before 2.8 comes out.
4. The current method isn't going away, so it might as well match 
functionality for internationalization for developers as much as possible.

I'll say, that for myself, I would rather have a fix in 2.5, in the 
event that the worst case comes to pass. Not that I don't have faith in 
your skill, but that I don't have faith in anything that is so unsure. 
Plus, there have been several times that interest on a project has 
peaked and then died shortly thereafter with barely a whimper (of 
course, I say that after several months of finally doing something about 
an issue that has peaked and died many times).

You know, if you are planning on getting this awesome feature into 2.6, 
then I'll totally bow to you and will build an idol in your image. 
However, do consider my arguments on why something should be done in 
WordPress 2.5.

Either use .htaccess, or make the subdomain "m" and then just use the
header(); parts. That's the easiest ways, at least. :P

I don't know of one.

I usually just rely on the version info on php.net:

http://uk.php.net/floatval
(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5)

Certainly.  Agreed.

I think the idea is to leave the current method working, but if  
somebody wants to make it localizable, they can use the second  
method.  Kind of the difference between using strings in a plugin or  
passing all strings through __() -- adding the __() function didn't  
stop anybody from ignoring it completely and using plain strings.

I don't believe anybody is talking about deprecating or removing the  
plain jane meta-data-in-a-comment method.  This is an enhancement,  
not a replacement.

_THAT_ is the reason not to do a "quickie" fix that is effectively  
going to be deprecated before anybody even sees it.  Doing a new  
method for v 2.5, just to replace it with a _different_ methodology  
in 2.6 is a bad move, because either the next version of WP will  
screw up plugins for 2.5, OR we will then have to support two  
different methods (three!) for the forseeable future.  It's a short  
term fix that will add unnecessary overhead in the future.

They both use gettext, but that's under the hood code.  You're  
talking about introducing one method, and then a second that is not  
compatible with the first.

I'm sorry if the (probably) one version delay makes you lose interest  
in WordPress, but respectfully, this community has a responsibility  
to look after the project, not the interest level of one coder.  No  
disrespect intended there, but shoring up your interest level is not  
cause to implement an ill-advised plan.

Not sure what that statement means, actually....

I suggested a plan that I thought would work well, and it _does_  
short of the fact that .pot editors won't harvest the string  
automatically.  Okay, that's a problem, and requires things to be  
done differently.  I'm not going to walk away just because things  
don't go the way _I_ want them to.

Peter makes me look long winded.  That sentence is my entire argument

I dont know of any existing maps like that, So i've just hacked together a quick table:
http://dd32.id.au/php-functions-by-version.htm

Its rough, Dirty, and potentially inaccurate(Scraped the local HTML manual with regular expressions), But it might be useful.

It doesnt care if a function is in a extension or core either, But it should be simple enough to tell from the function name.

(Hey, We've got sha1 now due to PHP4.3)

Message-ID: <479BFBC8.2060700@santosj.name>

I thought about your arguments for a long time and I've come to the 
conclusion that you are missing my point. It might be that I was just 
unclear, so allow me clarify.

I'm talking about an implementation which has been partially tested, 
shown to partially work, and the new patch should fix all of the 
complaints for the last patch. I'm talking about a patch for a version 
which the behavior is not deprecated, which solves a feature request a 
year old. I'm talking about 10-20 lines. I'm talking about something 
that if it was committed now, could be tested within the month before it 
goes live.

You both are talking about an feature, which has no implementation, has 
no release date (can only make one with an implementation) and by 
estimates, the ticket will be almost two years old when one is released. 
You are talking about a lot of code, which would have to be reviewed, 
debated, and then tested when committed.

I'm talking about fixing the issue for those who will be using 2.5 for 
the three to six months until the new feature is released that 
deprecates the old behavior. I'm talking about implementing a feature 
that most people will continue to use up when the new feature is 
released and continue to be able to use it even after the new feature is 
released.

The new feature could make building plugins a lot easier, safer, and 
with a better feature set than can be supported now. The current plugin 
data method works and has been tested and I believe with some partial 
evidence to support my argument that by committing my implementation 
would benefit a whole lot of people for WordPress 2.5 and beyond until 
the Super Awesome New Method is implemented.

I fully support you and anyone that builds this great feature and if no 
one stands up, then when May comes, I'll take up the challenge. If 
someone else does stand up, they have both my support with testing, 
suggestions, and help, and my appreciation because I'll love you forever 
for making my plugin writing awesome! Until then, I believe this is a 
non issue and if you don't know, we've spent more time debating whether 
the implementation should be WordPress 2.5, than it actually spent to 
write the implementation. You are right that whether I implement it or 
not does not matter, I'm just saying that I won't devote any time to 
something, when I have no extra time to give.

You know, I have no power whether or not the current implementation gets 
in for WordPress 2.5. If Peter and everyone else on the commit team 
thinks this new idea is the way to move forward, then great. However, I 
would be more content if it was a sure thing. I just totally hate the 
idea that something so minor has to go through so much debate, it is 
just crazy. So basically, I'm just politely trying to knock of the 
commit teams doors in the hopes that they'll listen to my reasoning and 
just commit the patch and see where it goes.

Basically, another reason I can't agree with you, is that I've been 
wanting to "replace" the implementation of query and rewrite with 
something more easy to define and more inline with Controller 
functionality. Trying to crack open the query is like drilling a hole in 
my head. I would rather like an easy to use function which adds both the 
rewrite path and query and load my script in the process. However, since 
I've stated this intention, should be just block all enhancements to 
query and rewrite until the new implementation is completed?

I think not and I think this debate is the same.

The debate could easily be ended by marking the ticket as "won't fix" 
and I'll supply a new patch which removes the behavior included in #5651 
patch.

Hello, I'm a bit new to WP development, so if my questions make me seem like
a total newbie, it's because I am.  I apologize in advance for if I ask
anything stupid.  I haven't been able to find good documentation on what I'd
like to do, so I figure this is the best place to go.

I'm looking to write a plug-in which uses the in-place posts table; however,
I'd like to use the 'post_type' column to insert a type other than 'post' or
'page,' such as 'album' or 'group.'  This is desired because it would keep
these posts out of the Page and Post sections under the admin Manage
screen.  Ideally though, I'd like them to be treated as regular pages so as
to take advantage of the existing template system.  The problem I've run
into is that the &get_post and &get_page functions seem to pretty much
ignore any records that have a 'post_type' entry that isn't 'post' or
'page.'  I'm wondering if there is a hook or other sort of mechanism that I
can use to make WP handle other values of 'post_type.'

Also, on a bit of a side-note, how much of a taboo is it to alter existing
WP table structures?  For instance, to add a column to the comments table?
Will it break upgrades and the such?

Thanks in advance for the help.

There are hooks allawing you to modify components of- or the entire MySQL
query that WordPress uses to fetch posts/pages.
I would keep plugin specific data in separate tables.

Yes, apparently, it does. Thanks for that. I was unable to confirm
because of an ongoing problem on my host at the moment. Much
appreciate your reviewing of this code snippet.

One way you can do this is setting the post_type query variable before
the posts are retrieved, say at the "parse_query" action hook, by
doing something like set_query_var('group') or whatever.

One of the most popular plugins, Mark Jaquith's "Subscribe to
Comments," alters the comments table by adding a "comment_subscribe"
field, and the lead WP developers featured it on the WordPress Extend
page for months, so I would say there is not much of a taboo.

*That should be set_query_vary('post_type', 'group');

I'm not sure I understand exactly how I would use the set_query_var()
function for my needs.  I'm also not sure that I explained my needs very
well in my original email.  So, I'll try and clarify a little bit
hopefully.  Take two:

I do not want these special pages to show up under Manage Pages or Manage
Posts.  I do want them to show up when one navigates to the pages'
permalinks.  See, simply changing the 'post_type' of an existing page makes
WP pretty much draw a blank.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I can
tell this is because by default WP only displays posts that have certain
pre-programmed 'post_type' values.  Again, correct me if I'm wrong, but it
seems like using set_query_var() will return only those posts which are of
the special value when used in a separate query.  This isn't what I want to
do at all.  I want the main query that handles usual post and page display
to simply get a little extra code functionality to display posts with other
'post_type' values.

Unfortunately I'm still just in the planning stages of my plug-in, so I
don't have code I can run immediate functionality tests on, but I'd like to
have an idea of how I'm going to implement my main functions before I start
coding them.  I'd like to keep database structure changes as minimal as
possible, so being able to use the existing structures with a little extra
code is what I'm going for.

So you want posts of both post_type "post" and post_type "group" to be
included together? Then I would use the 'posts_where' filter to call
back a function where a regular expression replaces post_type = 'post'
with (post_type = 'post' OR post_type = 'group').

To keep the admin area from being affected, just test with
"is_admin()" before applying the filter.

Well, that fixes one problem but creates another.  I created a simple test
plug-in to run the following code in a function applied by the posts_where
hook:

if ( !is_admin() ) $where = eregi_replace ("post_type = 'page'", "(
post_type = 'page' OR post_type = 'group' )", $where);

This does make it so that WP will display.  However, I think basically it
eliminates distinctions.  Under both 'Manage Pages' and 'Manage Posts' all
records of the posts table are returned.  Any idea why that would happen?

	added via a hook
Message-ID: <54526ec20801280338k1aec0328k69a6ba58aaa16e55@mail.gmail.com>

Heya,

I am writing a plugin that adds a page to the admin area. The added page
displays posts using a loop that is VERY similar to wp-admin/edit.php  -- In
fact, the loop is nearly identical except that $posts is filtered.

I see that I can control the display of posts by editing wp(), ie:

wp("posts_per_page=5");

and that works fine on my plugin page.

What I am trouble with is doing the pagination should it be necessary.



Since the user of the plugin will be able to change that setting, and since
even unchanged the list of posts displayed could get quite long..


Whats the easiest way to accomplish that on a plugin added page?

Thanks in advance,

Cherie

Just thought I'd share a hack we did on a video project called Semanal.
http://semanal.org/2008/01/27/week-5-2008-video-commenting-is-live/

You can see we added extra fields to the Comments so people add a
video URL and thumbnail URL.
This creates an embeddable video.

Here's how we did it:

Heh.  That's the exact same plugin. :)   For some reason I had the  
German Language page -- you linked the English page.  (The page you  
link has a link to the "German language version" that is the same URL  
as the one I gave above....)

What's your filter look like?  Did you return $where ? If you messed
up the return line, then you'd get all the posts and pages and
everything back even if the replacement works correctly.

Also, for a simple text replace without regex, you should use
str_replace. Faster.

Well, the filter is just two lines.  The first is the replacement line, now
with str_replace instead of eregi_replace (thanks for the speed tip).  The
second is 'return $where;'.  That's it.  Is there something I'm forgetting?
Again, I'm new to using hooks.

Anyway, I already tried switching the double and single quotes and
eliminating the parentheses within the replacement string just to be sure,
but no luck.

Subject: [wp-hackers] New uploader from #5722 in [6659]
Message-ID: <e6ec604d0801281329r229d6588p3f0c253f4b6602bd@mail.gmail.com>

Since http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/6659 we have a new uploader
in trunk. It will need some attention before 2.5 is released and I
think it's best if some people besides Alex and myself can hack it.
Thus I am posting the remainder of the todo list and ideas that we
didn't complete so that you may familiarize yourself with the code and
contribute something to its completion if you are interested.

First, a bit of explanation. The picture uploader accepts a single
image file, uploads it with a progress bar, attaches it to the post,
pre-fills some info from the file's metadata into the attachment
record, and gives the user a form for editing that record and
inserting the image into the post. The multimedia uploader lets you
select multiple files of multiple types (double entendre, heh) and
uploads them one at a time, shows individual progress bars, and lets
you start editing the titles/descriptions/taxonomies as soon as the
first file is done. It also lets you edit all of the attachments on
any post after-the-fact, including attachments uploaded using earlier
WordPress versions. Finally, the multimedia uploader will send the
entire set of attachments to the post as a little macro (shortcode)
that works like the embed codes on WordPress.com and an API is
included for plugging in new macros.

Error handling: the single uploader is pretty solid but needs testing.
The multi uploader needs testing and error display work. The basic
idea is to show errors without changing the work flow. Errors may be
shown on individual progress bars or description forms if appropriate.
Otherwise they should appear at the top and disappear when
appropriate.

Attachment sorting: the queries for displaying attachments already
have "ORDER BY menu_order ASC, ID ASC" but there is currently no UI
for sorting the attachments. I tried to make the bars sortable with
the included jQuery library but something about the positioning made
it all go haywire. I hope somebody can add sorting to the multimedia
uploader without creating additional UI elements.

Attachment template tags: we need functions to find adjacent
attachments (having same post_parent, using ORDER BY as above) and
displaying those much like previous/next post links. Also, support for
taxonomies is included in the multimedia uploader and it needs to be
added to the default template. It should at least display the taxonomy
title and list the terms.

More about taxonomies: there is an example at the bottom of media.php.
Basically, one line of code is all you need in order to add an
attachment taxonomy; it will automatically be added to the multimedia
uploader (thanks to the excellent new taxonomy API). What's missing is
a template tag for displaying plugged-in taxonomies. It should have
options for formatting (paragraph or list style, before/after tags,
etc.) and be added to the attachment template. These taxonomies will
need to be links and work with rewrite for pretty URLs, too. This is
intended to make it easy to add stuff like people tagging as seen here
http://ma.tt/photos/log/1-24-2007 and here
http://ma.tt/photos/person/andy-skelton (Matt's severely hacked
Gallery).

MIME types: the multimedia uploader is meant to accept all allowed
file types. We need thumbnail representations for more of the default
types. I added an audio thumbnail to the default theme a long time ago
and the attachment thumbnail function already looks for the right
thumbnail for the media type in the theme dir. That function needs to
fall back to core thumbnails for important types and such thumbnails
must be created, as well as a catch-all thumbnail. This way, themes
can supply their own MIME-based thumbnails if they want to. The idea
is to allow all attachments to be displayed in a thumbnail grid. There
should be thumbs for pdf, zip, txt, and probably a few others. (The
MIME type of each attachment is in the posts table, iirc.)

Gallery templates: Because we made it so easy to upload and describe
many images at once, we expect the multimedia uploader to make
WordPress a more attractive choice for people who otherwise might
install Gallery or use different web services. These people are going
to want their galleries to look a certain way. The included macro can
be overloaded by themes or plugins. There should also be gallery
template file support, along with all the rewrite stuff to make it
work: is_gallery().

Backward compatibility/progressive features: we used Flash because it
let us do cool things like progress bars and multiple file selections.
With JS but no Flash, you should still be able to upload files and
have them added to the multimedia upload list without reloading the
page. With no JS, the uploader window cannot be opened so it doesn't
need to work without JS. I think we should keep the iframe uploader
around in a noscript tag for that case. All of this needs verification
and testing.

There are probably more things I've forgotten and I hope Alex can
supply his list as well.

You do not need to ask anyone for permission to work on these things.
Form teams if you like, ask the list for opinions, post demo URLs, and
upload patches to trac, but I have other projects and I don't expect
to have time to work on this one. I will be happy to answer questions
about any code I might have written.

Cheers,
Andy

I tried your example, and it worked fine.

When I can't figure out stuff like this, I activate Ryan Boren's dump
environment plugin[1].  It will show you the final database query so
you can see exactly what's going wrong.

Ah, wow.  I feel a bit stupid now.  I forgot to pass $where into my filter
function.  The dump_env showed the query using "WHERE 1=1" which should only
happen when $where is empty, which meant that the $where my function was
returning had to be empty, which didn't make sense.  Okay.  Well, now that
that's fixed, it works great.  Thanks for all the help guys.  Hopefully I
should have pretty much all the info I need to get to work on that plug-in
now.

Seriously???!? You mean there is Flash in the core of the WordPress 
admin screens? I am truly shocked, and I am not kidding.

Why? I've not looked the patch over but I'm presuming it falls back to
the old method of uploading if the user doesn't have flash. Why
artificially limit ourselves when there are superior solutions that
degrade gracefully?

Jennifer, if you got as slick experience up your sleeve without Flash...

I thought WordPress was supposed to be based on open-source 
technologies. Can you even develop Flash without buying some Adobe 
software? I'm not sure about that, but it's definitely not open-source.

I can just imagine how well the JS version is going to be maintained.

Anyway, I've lodged my protest, now I'll be silent about it.

Flash itself isn't open source, but you can create Flash files with
non-Macromedia software (although none of them are as good as the
"real thing"), and the source of this particular flash app[1] is
freely available.

For better or worse, Flash is the ubiquitous web technology for
animation and interactivity.

As Rob suggests you can create Flash without using proprietary tools,
and good open source players. Though I don't even have flash installed
on this computer currently.

I appreciate you lodging your complaint, but I would be before
surprise if there is any reason to be concerned. Our anti-flash
compatriots will sure to tortue any developers that don't fix issues
in the non-flash experience.

Lets stay solution focused,

Actually, doing it using the standard loop was just a matter of adding the
regular pagination stuff - if you look at edit.php, the important bits are
inside wp()

I ended up NOT using the standard loop and so ended coming to a dead-end. I
figure eventually someone will figure it out for me, especially after it
becomes necessary in this new plugin.

Hi all,

first thing, I'd like to introduce you to the new alpha version of  
Gengo [0], ported to WordPress 2.3. Now it almost works! :-)

Afther that: if the plugin file is loaded as ajax it needs to know the  
ABSPATH, and the original author did it like this:

if (!defined('ABSPATH'))
require_once(dirname(dirname(dirname(dirname(__FILE__)))) . '/wp- 
config.php');

this usually works, but don't work if wordpress is installed in a  
different way, as you can see in [1]. There's a better and safer way  
to find that file? I can't find anything better...

By the way, if some of you can get in touch with Jamie Talbot please  
teach me how to do it, I'm trying since october without success. While  
I'm getting embarassed by this fork-that-is-not-a-fork, I'd love to  
talk with him and maybe merge our effort with the regular codebase on  
wordpress.org. But I couldn't find a working email address.. :-|

Thank you!

can you define better this step?

I'll explain: here at Amisnet we are building a huge audiofiles  
dealing system, and would be nice to have the ability to store some  
info (like audio bitrate and duration) and to have the ability (with a  
plugin hook maybe) to *write* some info to those files just after the  
upload (for example: hardcoding post title and post url into the id3v2  
tag of an mp3 file).

I can't find at my first read any ability to do this, so can you  
please explain if there's a hook for me? I'd love to work on this side  
next month....

Thank you!

I'm voting down

To solve this "a lot of javascript in an iframe" (problem?), it chould be just 
a form with an "Upload file" button that works just like "Save draft" which 
also handles the uploaded file. When hit, the post is saved and the file is 
uploaded. Easy? I believe so.

I finally understood what purpose having more than one dirname() has and 
well you don't need it. The same can be solved doing this: <?php 
require_once( realpath( dirname(__FILE__) .'/../../wp_config.php'); ?>. 
I would have to suggest that you first check whether the file exists two 
folders above you and if it doesn't, then check if it is three folders 
above you. However, since ABSPATH can be anywhere in relation to where 
your plugin is, I would say, just record ABSPATH and just call that path 
for AJAX. It would add some overhead, but you'll be right every time. 
Not sure how the user will feel having their full path stored in the 
database though. I wouldn't mind myself.

What in the WordPress API, do you need?

Why not just

    require_once( '../../wp-config.php');

The dirname() and realpath() calls are not needed, as far as I can
tell.

Using require_once inside a strictly proceted with relative paths is
ok, as long as you don't mix something like this:

    require_once( '../../wp-config.php');
    require_once( './../../wp-config.php');
    require_once( '././../../wp-config.php');

In other words, leading "./" is going to be problematic and isn't
needed with WordPress.  WordPress already uses include statements
without a leading dot directory, and in my humble opinion should
get rid of the few include statements with leading single dot
directories.  This would make it work within a directory tree
where the whole path to the root directory (on a UNIX system) is
not readable (only executable, i.e. searchable).

Calling realpath() is another problem for strict permissions and
in every case I've seen in WordPress, completely unnecessary.

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

True, that. In several projects, I just use which ever method pleases my 
eye at the time. However, I don't use relative paths such as those. As 
with WordPress, there are some safe mode issues (possible or whatever). 
It /is/ my convention to always use 
dirname(__FILE__).'/whatever/to/path'; However, a co-worker uses your 
method just fine. This is just one of those convention things that has 
no real end debate, so use whatever pleases you.

The reason you would use realpath, for your information, is so your path 
doesn't look like:  "Path/to/folder/../wp_config.php" which looks 
terrible. If you use realpath, it removes the folder and ../ and looks 
tons prettier. It also has the advantage of not giving you the path if 
the file doesn't exist. However, realpath also has overhead which is 
best not used.

However, I can't understand using dirname() multiple times, because the 
call just adds unnecessary overhead.

I think all of these are reasons why 'ABSPATH' exists.

ABSPATH doesn't exist until you include wp-config.php.  In the plugins I've
recently developed with ajax calls, I used the '../../../wp-config.php'
method and I haven't had any complaints with it.

I use this function in FireStats:

and it works well enough.

Why are you requiring wp-config.php? You should be requiring
wp-blog-header.php if you want to load the WordPress functionality.

I don't like making assumptions when I write code. You assume that the
include path has '.' in it, which would make your relative link work. By
using ABSPATH when it is defined (if you are going to insinuate further),
you bypass those assumptions.

The only time I use relative paths like that is when my code defines the
include path and I always define both ABSPATH and set the include path to
that. It is all in the boot strap file.

Which going off what another said, your path would evaluate to
'./../../../wp-config.php', so I mean the entire argument is pointless,
which is what I was stating. You have so many ways, that universally,
using ABSPATH is by far the best one to achieve uniform results of "Where
is the top application folder?"

I could go on, but I think we are just talking in cycles. You obviously
know what you are talking about, so I'm not telling you anything that you
didn't know and you are basically doing the same. This is probably useful
for others who don't know, but there are many (better) resources for
finding out this information.

In this step, we look for EXIF data and use it to fill the post_title
and post_content. Alex wrote that part. If nothing was found, we just
use the filename basename as the title.

It would be a great improvement if id3 data could be extracted from
the file and used much like we use EXIF data. However, the uploader
was not intended to modify uploaded files. That would have to be
accomplished by a plugin.

Cheers,
Andy

I would like to have a hook to play with this part.
For example: including getid3tag class, and reading the mp3.
Maybe something other for some other kind of files..

I would really do. I did even a patch to have a new hook and do this  
with the old wordpress code:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3831

Now I'll have to sort out a new hook and a new proposal :-)

Paolo.

If you want to start sketching out the ideas for the MP3 uploader with
me off list that would be awesome. As you may be aware, I need a very
similar thing for my own project - uploading MP3s, getting tags,
adding them to a database, all within a Wordpress plugin. We could
work on some kind of library with functions we can fold into both
plugins.

Excuse the off-topic (ish) post, but does anyone know the recommended

forum and then bring it to somebody's attention? If so, here's one I
made earlier: <http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic.php?id=16571> .
The word count is wrong and has been ever since it was introduced. If
it's going to be updated live by Javscript, it might as well be
correct.

Some users of a plugin I write aren't correctly retrieving option

previous get_option() calls. I have a niggling feeling that I might be 
misusing the _option() calls in one way or another. What I'm doing on 
installation is...

if (get_option("myoption")=="")

and later...

get_option("myoption");

returns "".

Any ideas?

This code works fine for me(While yours did too)

if ( false === get_option("myoption") ){
	var_dump(get_option("myoption")); //false
	add_option("myoption","defaultvalue");
}
var_dump(get_option("myoption")); //defaultvalue
delete_option("myoption");//cleanup for next test run

I've got the Object cache enabled, Or, what is left of it in trunk.

I've looked through the functions and i cant see why it'd not work..
I suggest using add_option rather than update_option, as that reduces the ammount of code which is run(Which decreases the possibility of something going wrong).


Note: get_option() return boolean false when the option doesnt exist, PHP evaluates "" and false as the same thing (When using ==), so thats not likely to be a problem unless you try to store a empty string in that option.

First thing:
get_option('doesnotexist') returns false, not an empty string.

Then, what about the following:
if (!get_option('myoption')) {
        update_option('myoption', 'default');
        wp_cache_flush();
}

Thanks I'll try this. It probably doesn't help that I've developing with 
the cache turned off, although I wasn't able to replicate the problem on 
a test install outside my development environment. Enough users have 
contacted me to convince me there's a real problem though =)

There was a bug (#4429) back in 2.2 that may have been the problem.  
Fixed in one of the later updates.
Maybe your users with the problem are using the older version?

Yes, "" == false. But it's still returning false, not "", so he should
be checking for identity, not equality.

Equality is trickier than identity because it uses the casting of types.

"" == false == 0 == "0" == null // all of these are true

"+010" == "10.0" // this is true too

If it's an MU-specific bug, then I suppose the MU trac. That said, I'm
pretty sure the word count feature is WP.com-specific. You could try the
WP.com forums (good luck, heh), but I suppose it'll attract attention from
the appropriate people here.

because it works fine.

I was not even aware of wp-blog-header.php, and looking at it, I`d say 
that it might have some unexpected output I`d rather avoid.

Including wp-blog-header.php does not produce any output at all unless
you have WP_USE_THEMES defined to be true.

Including wp-config.php directly means that the Loop will not be
initialized properly, and a lot of functionality won't be called
correctly if you're running something in the wp-admin directory. This
latter part probably means little to a plugin, I grant you, but if you
want it to get the normal posts Loop, you need to include
wp-blog-header.php, not wp-config.php.

wp-blog-header.php is basically the starting point for all of
WordPress. Starting with wp-config.php skips bits.

I believe you could also use the template_redirect action using some  
sort of unique request token. Then exit the function once your ajax  
job is complete. This basically stops WordPress cold before it  
includes template files. This probably would start some headers  
though. something like:

function do_my_bidding() {
	// Kill intruders
	if ( !defined('ABSPATH') ) exit();
	
	echo 'You are the boss!!'
	
	exit;
}

if ( $_REQUEST['do_my_bidding_token'] == 'yes-master' ) {
	add_action('template_redirect', 'do_my_bidding');
}

Then the request should look like:

http://my-wordpress.com/?do_my_bidding=yes-master

I don't know if this is what you are looking for, but I found it very  
useful for overly complex ajax functions that need a large set of  
built-in WordPress functions.

This works very well -- I use it to "highjack" control based on the
requested URL as well.

And because template_redirect is (ab)used like this due to the lack of
a better option, I've patched the non-template case to call the action
hooks as well.  Otherwise many plugins won't work in an embedded WP
installation.

But maybe there should be a common action hook and a private one for
each branch?  But template_redirect probably should become the common
one in that case, to preserve current functionality of plugins.

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

Hey all.  I'm a new one to the list here - figured as much as I hack WP 
myself, I might as well join the list to see what others are doing too!

So, I was interested in getting the upcoming version (I believe it's 
2.5?  Although I've been seeing some talk that they're trying to wade 
through 2.4, even though they plan to "skip it"...I may be wrong though) 
- I'd love to try it out and see if I could help with it a bit. Whether 
or not you actually *want* my help is another thing, but I thought I'd 
give it a shot!

Would anyone know where I could go to actually obtain a copy of it to 
install and run through?  I'd appreciate a point in the right direction.

Thanks!

~Shelly

Subject: [wp-hackers] Problem with wp_get_referer and IIS?
Message-ID: <FC3310AB-C695-49F8-B948-D52AEB650905@amphibian.info>

Hey all,

This is kinda a repost of a thread I started in December:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-December/016687.html

But the replies didn't really address the root of the problem.

Here's my situation again:

My plugin (GigPress) has its own Options page, located under a new top- 
level page.  So the URL of my options page is:

http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gp-options

This page posts its form contents to the main WP options page:

http://example.com/wp-admin/options.php

as instructed in the codex

http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Options_Pages

Under most configurations, this functions correctly - the form posts  
to the Options page, and then the user is sent back to the GigPress  
options page with the 'updated=true' string appended to the URI.

However, the problem people on IIS are having (I'm not sure it's all  
IIS setups, but this has been isolated to IIS so far), is that the  
'admin.php' part of the URI is stripped, so instead of landing at:

http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gp-options&updated=true

The user lands at:

http://example.com/wp-admin/?page=gp-options&updated=true

Which leads to an error page: "Cannot load gp-options."  (since the  
index of /wp-admin/ doesn't know what to do with '?page=gp-options')

 From looking at the options.php source, I can only think that the  
wp_get_referer function is not functioning correctly under these  
certain server configurations (whatever they may be, haha, very clear,  
I know).

Has anyone else encountered this problem?  Ideas?

Best,
Derek
