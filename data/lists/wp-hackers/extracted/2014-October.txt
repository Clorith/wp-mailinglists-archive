Please let me know if there's a better place to post this:

These download links are not working. Seems to be a server problem as
it is redirecting to the corresponding home pages.

* https://br.wordpress.org/latest-pt_BR.zip
* https://br.wordpress.org/wordpress-4.0-pt_BR.zip
* https://de.wordpress.org/wordpress-4.0-de_DE.zip
* https://ja.wordpress.org/wordpress-4.0-ja.zip

Left this very same message here:

Thanks.

Hello everyone! I just registered for the list. Does anyone have any advice for a newcomer in regard to finding ways to contribute to the WordPress project? I thought about contributing to the codex but thought my programming skills might be better utilized elsewhere.
Kindly,

Do you have any areas of expertise? User interface design? Javascript?
MySQL? Writing documentation? Testing?

Hello Eric, thanks for the response!
My expertise includes UI/UX design and programming but not so much Javascript. I would still consider myself a novice with JS and jQuery. I would probably be useful writing documentation or testing but even still, I wouldn't know where to begin without some guidance. Any further input would be much appreciated.
Kindly,
Robert Cummings

Cool! So.

If you?re interested in UI/UX design, you can take a look at what the UI group has been working on (http://make.wordpress.org/ui/), which has been mainly the Image Flow feature plugin. Of course, that?s not the only place UI/UX design is discussed. You can check out tickets in Trac that have a UI focus (https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&focuses=~ui&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority).

There?s also the core development team ?Make? blog (https://make.wordpress.org/core/).

I would suggest participating in a dev chat (https://make.wordpress.org/core/weekly-developer-chats/), and you might hear about a project that piques your interest to help with.

There's a reason for having contributor handbooks.

If you want to get involved, I recommend you to check out the handbooks
here:

what kind of issues? the php code showing as text?

if so you might have short tag off in your php.ini, I found this when
creating a new server, and forgetting to edit php.ini

Does WordPress core really not work without short tags? I've seen plugins
use them and I don't really like it, but I don't remember seeing issues
with the WordPress code itself.

Not with core, I think just plugins that decide to use them

No raw PHP displayed.  I was bit by that on the initial install. The default theme (or any other) doesn't render...

This is a dev system running as a Linux vm (Centos 7).  When I access using a firefox (either at localhost or the IP address of the interface) on the VM, all is well, when I access
the IP of the vm from outside the vm, No theme, no css.  Very weird.

Any relevant console errors or debug.log errors? Does the install work with
the default themes? Can you access the dashboard or is it completely
impossible to get in at all?

If you're able to log into the Dashboard, try switching to another theme
and see if that displays properly.

If it's a development system, turn on WP_DEBUG. Does the white screen
provide any Fatal Errors or anything?

Just taken a quick look on line, and I found this:

Source: https://www.apachefriends.org/faq_windows.html Under "Why are
pictures and style-sheets not displayed?"

Sometimes there are problems with displaying pictures and
style-sheets. Especially if these files are located on a network
drive. In this case you can enable (or add) one if the following lines
in the file "\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf":

EnableSendfile off
EnableMMAP off

This problem can also be caused by programs for regulating bandwidth,
like NetLimiter.

Not sure if this the same thing though.

Daniel Fenn

There also this as well: https://www.apachefriends.org/faq_linux.html

XAMPP runs, but why are none of the images being displayed?

That's a special problem with some Linux systems. Please open your
/opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf and look for these two lines:

#EnableMMAP off
#EnableSendfile off

Remove the # in both lines and restart your Apache. Your images should be back.

Daniel Fenn

Message-ID: <72B27557-7D2C-4D45-9580-611CBDBC25C4@manifestbozeman.com>

I'm working on developing a plugin for a client site that I think may have some value to the WordPress community. It's purpose would be to allow a site to connect to a RETS based MLS site and import real estate listings and images into the site. I'm looking to garner feedback on the implementation and to determine whether it would be of use to others.

Can anyone suggest methods that they've used to test the waters and determine if a plugin would be of use?

There are a few premium plugins on the market that do RETS and many more
third party website companies that offer WP / RETS support. If you are
suggesting a Free on on the repository then I think it would be very
popular.

Subject: [wp-hackers] New wpdb instance
Message-ID: <54406B13.5070603@duechiacchiere.it>

Hi list,

I need to connect to a different database to retrieve some data. So I'm 
instantiating a new $wpdb object:

$new_wpdb = new wpdb( params );

It happens sometimes that I enter the wrong credentials, and if WP_DEBUG 
is true, this renders the WP admin totally inaccessible and I need to 
rename my plugin's folder to get it back:

https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/wp-db.php#L581

How can I check that the credentials I have are legit without blowing up 
the admin?

Thanks,
Dino.

Hello at all.

I will ask here in the hackers community. Maybe you know more about the
project
https://github.com/post-forking/post-forking

For a year was the project very active, but currently in sleep. A lot of
pull request inside the project, but no working. I think the project have a
lot of nice features and it was helpful, that a group of guys work on it.
Thanks for hints or feedback.

Message-ID: <CANWKvSyc6KcFg--CDvETRwFAe=tGqLNQouv6WnDA9P-Mt++B+g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm having trouble configuring WP's auto updates to work with a plugin that
I have hosted on my own server. After troubleshooting within the plugin
without luck, I finally stripped everything out to a simple plugin that
ONLY tries to update itself, with no other functionality.

//
require_once 'classes/plugin-updates/plugin-update-checker.php';
$myPluginUpdateChecker = new PluginUpdateChecker_1_4(
    'http://example.com/myplugin.json',
    __FILE__,
    'myplugin'
);

add_filter( 'auto_update_plugin', '__return_true' );
//

The Plugins dashboard shows that an update is available for the plugin, and
clicking "Update Now" functions properly, but ideally I would like this
plugin to automatically update when WordPress goes to run its 12-hour cron
to update plugins.

By manually running the cron, I've proved that all wordpress.org-hosted
plugins *do* update automatically... so I guess my question is, what's
different? What do i need to DO differently in order to get my self-hosted
plugins to behave in the same fashion as plugins hosted in the official
repo?

In the end of this, I'd ideally like for ONLY my plugin to automatically
update (by using code similar to what's found here, only reversed logic...
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/131394/how-do-i-exclude-plugins-from-getting-automatically-updated
) but for now I'm trying to just use the __return_true value to prove that
it works at ALL.

Thanks in advance! I've spent countless hours trying to get this to work,
and I'm just at my wit's end with it. I've about run out of ideas to try,
so I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.

Dave

I think real problem you have with wpdb->bail() which has wp_die() inside.

Anyway, whenever where problem is exactly, you can always extend wpdb class
to your my_wpdb() class (name it better) and overwrite some methods. Then
call new my_wpdb( params ) and all will be good

I'm not sure that this list is the right place to discuss third-party  
libraries, but I'll answer anyway. It looks like you're using an older  
version of my update checker:
https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker

Like WordPress itself, this library defaults to checking for updates every  
12 hours. However, it uses a custom cron hook, so maybe it didn't get  
triggered by whatever you did to run cron manually.

You can change how often it checks for updates by passing the check period  
(in hours) to the constructor:

require_once 'classes/plugin-updates/plugin-update-checker.php';
$myPluginUpdateChecker = new PluginUpdateChecker_1_4(
	'http://example.com/myplugin.json',
	__FILE__,
	'myplugin',
	42  //Check every 42 hours.
);

If you want your plugin to have full control over when exactly it checks  
for updates, you can turn off automatic checks by setting this argument to  
0. Then call $myPluginUpdateChecker->checkForUpdates() directly.

You can use the Debug Bar plugin to see the last update check time, when  
the next automatic check will happen, and other useful information. It'll  
show up in the "PUC (your-plugin-slug)" panel.
https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/

Most of the above described in the documentation:
http://w-shadow.com/blog/2010/09/02/automatic-updates-for-any-plugin/

Message-ID: <CAEi=p50Sz7Y1Kp1xFXnCwV0HSZgNcSO=scq=E74ngMnm7ek_Og@mail.gmail.com>

Before I open a Trac ticket, I wanted to talk through a minor frustration I
have with the link tool to see if a) it's an issue others have and b) if
it's something worth changing.

When I'm writing a post, I often highlight text and want to use *that same
text* as the text for the link (which is used as alt text when the anchor
tag is rendered in markup). This is particularly relevant when I'm linking
to a book title, another article, or a person's name.

What I'd really like to see is the link text pre-populated with my
selection when the link modal opens.

Does this make sense to anyone else? Does it feel like a good idea? Should
I take some time to open a ticket and work on a patch?

I find your question confusing. What is the ultimate markup you're looking
to end up with?

I ask because anchor tags (links) don't have alt text. Alt text goes on
images.

Now, anchor tags can have "title" attributes, but the title should not be
just a duplication of the anchor text (the stuff inside the <a></a>). The
anchor text should name the link, while the title should provide additional
information about it. They should never be the same.

So, what you have selected should be what text becomes the link. You should
select the anchor text. Which means that it naturally should not duplicate
that text anywhere else in the anchor tag's attributes, as I see it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] getting pending\future posts
Message-ID: <CAKZEVgend+WECx3avK4B37T=PSKbuW6wnN5_ZAb-ejJUxfyR3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,
I have a lot of experience in develop for WordPress, but I am new at this
mailing list.

I am working on some plugin that calls future and pending posts.

There is nice core function that return the draft posts of the user:
get_users_drafts( $user_id ). But there is no other function for getting
the future state posts.

This function suppose to be very easy to write. Something like that:
http://pastebin.com/B1PYweRC
Also, maybe there is a need similar function for getting the pending posts
for the user. There was function with the same functionality:
"get_others_pending", but it is deprecated.

Since I never contributed to WordPress core. Should I add those two
functions (and the matching tests of course) to WordPress user.php ?

Sincerely yours,

I get what Eric is talking about - we don't have a "link text" field in the
popup. We have a title field for the actual title attribute, which we
really need to get rid of (and not use for internal linking) because it
promotes bad accessibility practices. I think switching to a more typical
"link text" field would be much more sensible, and be able to insert a link
without first selecting text, which is quite nice for people who aren't
mouse users. Would be curious what a Trac search turns up.

Subject: [wp-hackers] term_exists returns (string) based $term_id value as
	opposed to (int).
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2+edhAMqPeqba72Pa=ocH6m1Qx6fBuiDHv_Fv6JB2M2Q@mail.gmail.com>

I spotted this bug while I was migrating a legacy site into WordPress

In the wp_insert_term function, there is a section that goes like this;

    if ( $term_id = term_exists($slug) ) {

        // if you are here, then you got a string based $term_id in your
hands.
        // example: (string

    } else {

        //do stuff here

        $term_id = (int) $wpdb->insert_id;

        // here, there are no problems here... cause $term_id is forced to
be an integer!

    } endif;


    Having a string term_id causes a problem later on down the road,

    When the wp_set_post_terms() is called with its $tags argument having
string formatted term_ids, those terms are considered as no-show under the
corresponding taxonomy, and wordpress creates new terms on the fly.
