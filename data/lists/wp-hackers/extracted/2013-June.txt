Thomas,

Thank you for the response.

Even I think that backward compatibility will be a big issue that needs to
be taken care of. I thought about the points you put in and I was able to
come up with a plan.

I feel that if this change is to be implemented, it needs to be done when
the release cycle enters 4.x a change of this type cannot be catered by any
other method. Moreover, when this upgrade takes place, the user will get a
security message. If he approves the change, a script will check the
installed plugins and detect if they are compliant to the change. If
they're not, we deactivate the plugins.

Also, the database will be exported before the change, so that in case of a
failure, it can be rolled back.

The import/export functions will be changed accordingly.

Subject: [wp-hackers] API layer
Message-ID: <CA+6Lma3iN2ugBkSDgRSwc1pmCeSy=HHzOnmbAQDPxknW6CwURA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been working on a developer oriented API layer for WordPress - it's a
separate (but smallish) application that sits alongside your WordPress
install to help ease development of mobile, flash, JS clients etc.

Mobile-------->
JS Clients--->    A
Flash---------->    P    ----> WordPress Admin
Feeds/Data->    I
Other---------->

It lets us use WordPress for what it is awesome at - the content
management, and helps provide a nice clean interface to that content. It
returns content in any number of configured media types using the Accepts
header or a content type in the URL (/posts/123.json). In progress or
completed so far are:

xml
csv
text
yaml
plist
pdf (with templating)
json
hypermedia formats:
- hal+json
- collection+json
- json+api
- hal+xml

Oauth2 authentication is also implemented with a start on scopes and api
endpoint access restrictions. I've been researching the different
approaches to secure JS clients.

My questions are:

a) is anyone interested in the project?
b) are there any features that people would like to see in a project like
this

It's built using the Lithium PHP framework - which is incredibly flexible.
At the moment it is built as a basis to work off, but there is no reason it
can't be changed into a standalone application with custom
routes/controllers in your own plugin.

Cheers.

Hi Christian,

I am highly interested. Is there any code or a repo to look at? I'd really like to see your approach and how it handles the processing of requests.

Sure - the repo is private at the moment (no real reason, just not
complete) but send me your github id and I'll add you as a collaborator.

Hey Christian,

I'm working on something similar as part of GSoC this year, but as a
plugin (with the eventual goal of core integration). You can check it
out at https://github.com/rmccue/WP-API

I'd love to hear about your experiences building your application. I've
previously implemented my own in a similar method (external application
hooked into WordPress) and although it's a little easier to implement,
it's less distributable.

Thanks,

Hey Ryan,

Just had a look at WP-API - looks great. There is definitely some stuff in
there I can use.

Main issues for me developing are:

a) should it accept all parameters to WP_Query/WP_Comments_Query etc or
provide a simplified subset of available parameters (like the rest api on
wordpress.com)
b) output json - some clients (Ember for example) like particular formats
and there are lots of different conventions. I.e. wrapping the response in
a top level element like "posts", and sideloading comments instead of
embedding in the post themselves.
c) how to output menus - in a hierarchical format or flat with parent/child
keys and let the client deal with it
d) outputting media - should it just provide the URL to the media file or
do more like convert/optimize etc.
e) security - how to authenticate securely, assume it's not possible unless
site is on SSL. Different oauth grant types, scopes etc and how to use from
a JS only client.

Anyway - have added you as a collaborator, would love any ideas/feedback
you have.

Cheers.

Hi all,

I've been using Aptana to work with WordPress for quite a while and I
am very happy with it.
I'd like to know if someone has ever used Aptana's debug/run utilities
to debug WordPress sites and, if so, can suggest a tutorial guide with
all steps needed to correctly configure the IDE.

Thank you!

I use also Aptana and it works wit WP and xDEBUG to debug on local client.
You can use the helpers in Chrome or Firefox to activate the debug trace in
xdebug and match this to Aptana.
You find tutorials in the www, how is this possible.

Subject: [wp-hackers] on the role of guid
Message-ID: <51AF0F71.7020805@gmail.com>

Hi everybody,
I  was looking for info about the guid field in wp_posts and I stumbled 
on this page, which states that you should never-ever change the guid 
field even if you change your site's domain.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_The_Site_URL#Important_GUID_Note

I've recently started to hack around some wordpress plugins, and I noted 
that at least one of those I encountered rely on the guid field as a 
source of redirect.
As I understand this is clearly in contrast with guidelines as described 
in the above page. If the guid field is to be used as a globally unique 
identifier for the post, wouldn't it be better to rely on a kind of SHA 
hash?
Doing that will avoid any wrong use of the guid field by less informed 
plugin developers.

What do you think?

I found this old post:

http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2011-May/039280.html

I don't know if it has been further discussed, anyway I think a good way 
to generate unique GUID is to generate a hash from the post URL plus a 
timestamp. In this way even if the domain is reused by somebody else on 
a later time, the guid would remain unique due to the dimestamp. For 
additional uniqueness, the post body can be included in the hash. Of 
course, this step is to be taken only on create.

Hey everyone,
some time back there was a post on the list which gave a rough idea on how
themes and plugins are uniquely identified on WordPress.org to located the
right update packages etc.
Can anyone here give me some more insights?

Obviously, plugin names are not unique. Author+plugin name won't do the
trick either I guess. The author can change. How is .org doing it?

Regards,
Alex

Plugin Slugs are unique, however :) That's how we do it.

I don't believe that is how it works actually. A plugin can live in a
directory with a different name locally and updates to it will still
be found.

IIRC from past threads, the API makes an informed decision based on
the plugin name, author, URI, and filename. Maybe other fields too.

Correct, John.

WP.org uses a combination of the plugin slug, plugin name, plugin URL,
etc., to identify a plugin. Assume that we use any header sent back, we use.

Alex, for your GSoC project, use the plugin's slug + filename, as returned
by plugin_basename(), and as used for activate_plugins().

Thanks Andrew. Atm I wanted to use author, plugin name, file name.
Idea of asking here was to do it the same way as .org because others maybe
already spent more thoughts on it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using the Nav Menus UI else where
Message-ID: <CAJLhW7Kfd7BbnNK8uLGvTsRg9uQ3Lhypxr2GoFbgHGp4CMmCng@mail.gmail.com>

Is it possible to use the existing Nav Menus UI else where within the admin?

What I'm looking to do is register a post type of "nav menu item", use it
from within custom page in the admin, then filter/hook into the interface
(changing some form fields, etc.)

I'm aware that nav menus is a custom post type (built-in) with custom
taxonomies.

I've dug around in core,
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.5.1/wp-admin/nav-menus.php,
finding functions, but from what I'm seeing it doesn't seem possible.

I'm trying to avoid copy/pasting/re-writing code from within core as much
as possible.

There's been talk of changing the field to a UUID, or at least adding a new
column for a proper UUID. You're right, plugins shouldn't be using that
field as a permalink, but they do. And even if they're wrong, they're out
there.

Someone even submitted a GSoC proposal for setting up a proper UUID. I
don't think it was accepted, but it would be nice to see someone try
building an implementation and seeing what issues crop up with different
plugins & themes.

Someone did put in a GSoC on this and it was rejected. I think there
was other things that needed to be sorted out first.

Message-ID: <CALri7M=Vi91ZOUU5pxAp6KK_4S5aH8WKkSxDLWd0spWdA8dnzQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've got several sites running on a WPMS install, and I'm making use
of get_last_updated().

On the default blog index page, I'm listing all blogs using
get_last_updated(); it's a neat way to have a dynamic homepage with
the most recent blog at the top of the page.

http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU_Functions/get_last_updated
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/ms-blogs.php#L733

Description: "Get a list of most recently updated blogs."

What exactly does "recently updated" mean?

Is that only when a blog post has been created/updated/deleted? Are
there other things that will update the last_updated value?

Thanks!
M

The value changes when a published post is created, updated, or deleted
(for any public post type); and when update_blog_status() or
update_blog_details() are called.

Awesome! Thanks for the answer Andrew, I really appreciate it.

I wonder if this info would be helpful on the Codex page for get_last_updated()?

Thanks again!

The great thing about the Codex is the fact that it is a wiki. I'd say add it if you think it will help other people.

Message-ID: <51B492D7.9040307@rotorised.com>

Hi hackers!

I'd like to announce as part of my GSoC project, repositories for my
JSON REST API are now up. You can access them via GitHub or SVN:

https://github.com/rmccue/WP-API
https://gsoc.svn.wordpress.org/2013/rmccue/trunk/

I've written up a bit about the plan for WP API on my blog:

http://journal.ryanmccue.info/224/introducing-wp-api/

At the moment, I'm slightly behind schedule due to exams and sickness,
so I'm working through the design document stage at the moment. You can
take a look at the spec as it stands now:

I'd love to have feedback on this if you're interested in the project,
as this is where I'll be making some crucial decisions on how the API
acts. The best place for that is the GSoC Trac:

https://gsoc.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/264

Thanks hackers, and I look forward to your feedback!

Buddypress can make much more then you saying.

Or you can find some one who can make custom profile and social network for
you.
For example ? make a music website for artists and fans peoples can be fan
their artists and they can write wall their profiles
http://www.raptun.com/uye/sinanisler/ look it is cool. this is not plugin
by the way custom code.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Hashing user_activation_key in the database
Message-ID: <51B9A75C.7060002@dxw.com>

Hello all,

During a recent penetration test, the tester found an SQL injection in a 
plugin. He used that injection to identify an administrative account, 
then requested a password reset using the form, and then used the 
injection to retrieve the user_activation_key. Because the key is not 
hashed, he was able to immediately log in, without having to spend any 
time trying to break the password hash.

Without finding an SQL injection or arbitrary code execution 
vulnerability, this is not too much of an issue. But having found one of 
those things, WordPress generating and setting an unhashed password for 
the account (which is what it boils down to) makes obtaining 
unauthorised access very much easier.

I think this is a straightforward enough thing to fix, and I'm happy to 
jump in and do it. But I thought it might be sensible to consult this 
list before I go and spend time making a patch for a trac ticket.

What do people (and in particular, core committers) think about this? Is 
a sensible patch likely to be accepted?

Cheers,

Harry

adding, or making pluggable.

If the injection came via a plugin, can you also email the plugin name and details to plugins AT Wordpress.org please?

I think the security team (a superset of the core committers) would have
some pretty interesting opinions on this. In the future, is best to email
security at wordpress.org to get initial feedback before posting to a public
forum. We'll thank you for responsibly starting a private communication
with us and direct you to a public forum as appropriate.

I would suggest that, while it is not a bad idea, such a vulnerability
could always be used to change the user's hash. Of course, there are
situations where a vulnerability will only result in reading data, not
writing it. Again, security at wordpress.org in the future please, thanks.

I'm just wondering about the semantics of plugin names for wordpress; in
particular if I change the capitalisation of the my plugin name, will it
have any implications for the plugin on http://wordpress.org/plugins?

The plugin name in your readme.txt file can be anything you like. You can change it as much as you want, but your plugin will still live on the same page at http://wordpress.org/plugins, will use the same SVN repo, and will reside in the same folder name on WordPress installations and continue to recieve auto-updates. This is because it's the plugin slug that matters ( http://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-slug ), not whatever you name the display name set in readme.txt or as 'Plugin Name:' in your plugin PHP file.

It's quite popular, but it's already been patched and a new version 
released. So if you're up to date you'll be fine.

Where is the plugin-slug defined, then? It doesn't come from the source?

Nope. It is built from the plugin name you enter when you submit the plugin to the WordPress.org repo, much in the same way a permalink is built from a post title in WordPress. After then it can't be changed.

Ah, this is all fine then. I can change the name a bit and no one will
be affected.

I went to login to my WordPress site today but it was not accepting my
username/password. It kept saying invalid username which I knew was valid.
I accessed cpanel then phpmyadmin to find the username, password, and
email had been changed. I used the generator on your site to provide a new
password hash then using phpmyadmin I change the username and email back
and set a new password. The password has been changed along with my cpanel
and mysql passwords. It does not appear any changes were made other than
this.

The wired thing is the username was changed, which cannot be done in
WordPress you have to do it in the database itself. Leading me to believe
it was the web host that was hacked not my WordPress install. What are you
thoughts? What else should I do?

I should also mention that I also changed the keys in wp-config as well
and have notified my host to see if they can tell if the server was hacked
or not.

Sounds like a server side hack.

Step 1, Inform the host and ask what they are doing about it.
Step 2, Wait for a reply from the host blaming WP.
Step 3, Move hosts.

Sorry to hear about your compromise.

First things first, make sure your WP installation is up to date as well as
all plugins.

once a machine has been compromised, It cannot be trusted. if starting from
scratch is not an option, dig through your code and look for any suspicious
code/files that may be used as backdoor.

Use strong passwords with over 10 characters and special symbols for
maximum effect.

If you have access to host machine and/or network... add firewalls, host
and/or network based.

Also check logs for any suspicious behavior!

It's on shared hosting, unfortunately it has to due to budget.

You should still be able to get access logs for your websites.

I have been in the same boat no long ago, it actually happened more
than once. After I changed it all back(username/password) within a few
days it was compromised again. I didn't and still don't use the admin
username but the username I use for administrative purposes was changed
to admin.

After some investigation it was clear it was not a WordPress issue.
Some other site on the shared hosting got compromised and the hackers
were able to access a majority of tables in MySQL. I know for that was
it, as I did a bit more detective work.

I changed my theme to do the following:
When somebody tried to log as a admin user and it wasn't from my IP,
don't log them in. Send me an email with username, undecrypted
password , http referrer etc. With this info I was able to determine
they used a kiddie script from a certain site. That site was located on
the same shared server I was on. I got hold of the same script, it was
freely downloadble on the Internet, installed it on my server and I
could access several other sites on the shared server.

Long story short, just because you changed your username and password
back to something you know, does not mean your site won't be
compromised again.

It could be as mundane as getting file system access to your 
wp-config.php file.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress#Securing_wp-config.php

I use both the relocation and  the .htaccess methods described there. 
They do work.

Message-ID: <CAEgmxabu8wDdXu0EzG52+GHQ23i0U0O79ipHAr1hCN34LLv9aQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a WordPress network (subdomain), with domain mapping
(sunrise). Admin is alway done via the non-mapped domain. One blog (not
mapped, if that makes any difference), has an SSL certificate and is

Is there a way to stop users that flick between the secure and non-secure

Subject: [wp-hackers] Missing upload filter and api calls to
	api.wordpress.org
Message-ID: <51C1C305.4070703@one.com>

Hi guys,

I've been following the mailing list for a while, but this is my first 
post. I've been searching far and wide, with no results yet, so I hope 
that you will be able to help me out.

I've been looking for a hook to rewrite filenames (both paths and urls) 
on uploaded files. I've been using wp_handle_upload_prefilter with 
success, but it has no effect on uploads done with XMLRPC. I haven't 
been able to find any way to do this yet.

Another thing I've struggled with is stopping the version checks 
WordPress sends when a user logs in to admin. I'm using 
DISALLOW_FILE_MODS as I do not wish any users start those updates 
themselves, and thus I do not need to check for new versions. I feel 
that WordPress should know not to do that, but it does not seem to care 
that updating is disabled. Is there any other way to disable the calls 
to api.wordpress.org, without placing: "127.0.0.1 api.wordpress.org" in 
the /etc/hosts file on the server?

Have a nice day!

I'm not sure about the first point in your email, so I'll leave that
to someone else, but there are plugins available for disabling
automatic updates to WordPress:

 * http://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-wordpress-core-update/
 * http://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-wordpress-plugin-updates/
 * http://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-wordpress-theme-updates/

Your site will still perform calls to the browser update check
endpoint though. There's also an API call on the About WordPress
screen which fetches the list of contributors. I'm not sure if there's
a plugin to disable those calls, or indeed disable all wordpress.org
API calls at once. Might be worth a Google.

Hello all,

In case everyone been under a php rock, there is a new version of php:
5.5.0 and I can see a serious issue cropping up, the support for mysql
has been dropped and one will need to use PDO_mysql or mysqli.

Does anyone know when WordPress will be supporting mysqli?

There have been some discussions on trac, to be sure. Seems like PDO has

And just to set any fears aside, the mysql extension still works in php
5.5, it's just deprecated, just like core deprecates things in favor of a
new api's all the time.

So for now, if you move to php 5.5, just make sure you enable the
extension, since some distro's may not enable it by default.

I don't think there will be a big jump to 5.5 for plugin/theme 
development as 5.2 is still the predominate version used with WordPress 
installs. I'm still waiting (hoping) for the day 5.3 becomes the minimal 
requirement (namespaces and closures anyone).

Travis CI won't even test for PHP 5.2! :-)

An impressive number of hosting providers does have really bad practices
about that, either because their server imaging system isn't so easy to
upgrade and deploy (this happen mainly with pre-cloud providers with
real machines) or because their hosting system requires server admins to
compile each time a fresh Apache + PHP stack (like CPanel).

Good thing is that the managed WP providers wave should help a bit on
this side, forcing other providers to get on pair.

Another great subset are personal and self-managed servers, many won't
upgrade until they switch to another server. Absurd but real.

I've seen on twitter that some WP core developers would like to push for
PHP 5.3 base support in the next major release, hope it's real, it's
about time :-)

Actually, although it's not documented any more, it will let you. The
Travis team were having some problems with building it so decided to
drop official support, but it looks like it's still working:

https://travis-ci.org/rmccue/Requests/jobs/8209092

The reason hosts are still on 5.2 is because they've been on it for a
while and they know it works. Changing that for their customers
inevitably means breaking things, so it's easy to see why they don't
upgrade faster.

And hosts don't give a crap about some software refusing to work that
clients may want to use? Also from my understanding php 5.2 isn't
getting any more updates as well.

Adding to that, what about security issues?

Nice! I'll try it in the next commit, thank you for sharing.

I understand this view, but I think that a major release (or two) behind
should be enough. 
PHP 5.2 was out in 2006 while PHP 5.3 was in 2009: I'm not sure about
how many legacy code runs online, but from the internet point of view
feel like it was a century ago :-)

As many open source project pushed a lot for PHP5, maybe it's time to do
that again and set an higher base PHP version. Would help a lot both
WordPress and developers out there.

I second that, but many providers aren't. Stats are quite impressive,

This isn't the problem at all. All of the major hosting companies
using cPanel (and other control panels) offer multiple versions of PHP
at the customer's choice, and multiple customers on the same server
are even running different versions of PHP (depending on what they're
hosting and it's requirements).

The fact is, all of them already have the choice to run PHP 5.4 (and
likely 5.5 very soon), but (in the case of shared hosting) it's up to
the customer to take responsibility for upgrading themselves when they
know the software they have chosen to use supports newer versions of
PHP. You might also be surprised to learn that quite a lot of
perfectly healthy websites out there wont work on PHP 5.3+.

I can assure you that the hosting companies still providing 5.2 are
monitoring the health of those accounts, and are weighing the costs of
breaking a large percentage of their customers' sites when being
forced to upgrade versus letting those sites be hacked if security
becomes a problem. Eventually, they will drop support for 5.2 entirely
and automatically upgrade everyone to 5.3, but honestly, most exploits
out there for 5.2.17 require some very specific and rare conditions to
be met before anything is exposed. Very few sites still on 5.2 are
actually in any danger, assuming the software itself (not PHP) is
secure. Most of the time, it's the custom scripts and web applications
you have to worry about, not PHP, and upgrading PHP (assuming it still
works) usually won't even solve the types of security issues they
should be worried about.

Try finding a linux-based global attack vector that poses a serious
threat and works everywhere from this list [1]. There's only DoS
attacks that work regardless of the PHP scripts installed, and not
only are those easily detected and mitigated by hosting companies
without any serious damage done, but they are also always possible
even with the latest version of PHP anyway (it's just harder to pull
off).

This won't happen in 3.7 or 3.8, and likely not even in 3.9. It would
be great, and everyone would love to be able to use the newer features
of PHP (hence why devs love to rant about it), however, none of those
features are mandatory, and absolutely none of them are worth leaving
60% (let alone 20%) of WordPress users in the dark with an old,
insecure version of WordPress just because they haven't upgraded their
hosting (or can't).

Hi WordPress Lovers :)

I have done the first version of my new plugin "Momtaz Nmwdhj"
http://wordpress.org/plugins/momtaz-nmwdhj/

Simple it's an API for creating forms elements via code. I think it will
help many WP developers as it helps me a lot in my thems/plugins.

Happy to read your feedback :)

Were you aware of https://github.com/jbrinley/wp-forms
To me, it would make sense to collaborate on one strong project, rather

Message-ID: <CAEgmxaa-y99_BxnGSYAoXMeHnp1jvc=Kg__r0TnjzNAW4rEc7A@mail.gmail.com>

I have a network that was set up using www (even though the guide says not
to).

Is there a way to fix this?

I have tried updating wp-config.php, wp_blogs and wp_site.

I can get it to the point where all the non-primary sites and their domain
mappings appear to work. The primary blog works, and the /network/ can be
browsed.

However, the two issues appear to be:
1. Browsing /network/ is done on www site
2. Adding new sites fails with 'Are you sure you want to do this?'

Thanks!

Yes, I know it :)

"WP Forms API" is not that kind of big, active, long-term project, In
addition:

1- The plugin focused on the thing that me and many others doesn't need,
for all my common cases, I just need a plugin to create and render the form
elements objects to HTML code. The form Validation, Processing are
something I will not add to my plugin.

2- Some of the plugin logic need to re-think about...
How to add/replace the element Types/Views/Decorators?
How the plugin define the Views,Decorators?

You can think of "Momtaz Nmwdhj" like a new "fork" for "WP Forms API"..
and absolutely I don't want to develop "Momtaz Nmwdhj" alone, the project
is open for every one want to make it better..

Check wp_options too. The home and siteurl entries often remain oroblematic.

Actually, you may want to search the whole DB to see what lingers. But beware serialized data :/

A script like this one can help with the serialized data search + replace, at least:

http://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/

Have used it a few times when moving a multisite over to a new core domain (in addition to any non-db changes like wp-config.php) and has worked well.

Thank you, Leho, for pointing that out. I would love to get feedback (and,
of course, code/documentation contributions) from anybody using or
interested in using WP Forms. Even if you don't want the
validation/submission features of it, WP Forms can be used for simply
creating the form HTML.

And whether it's this or a better form API, it's my opinion that having a
solid, community-supported API for rendering and processing forms would
have huge benefits for WordPress. If anyone agrees, and if you have ideas
for getting us there, I'd love to hear from you.

Have a nice day,
Jonathan

Thank you for your reply @Jonathan Brinley,

The Diversity is really helpful, to get many ideas and a lot of options,
this why the people have the "alternative" word :)

Sure thing having a solid, community-supported API is a needed thing, and
because there is not something like that yet! We want to give this more
attention, most of this current plugins are not much stable, I really did a
hard search before I build "Momtaz Nmwdhj".

So if you think to re-build the "WP Forms API" get me in touch.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Need WP/PHP guru eyeballs/feedback on my WP_Widget
	wrapper class
Message-ID: <CALri7Mk+U5FKzehxaOB2k4bLrGuRzNjGoWF4TvOdTmiFZ3CwBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Currently, I have a setup for custom widgets where I create a simple
class for each new widget. For example:

class.widget_1.php
class.widget_2.php
class.widget_3.php
...

While the above works well, I'm finding that I'm repeating a little
bit of boilerplate code for each widget (even after extending an
abstract class with most of the boilerplate in that).

In an attempt to improve my code, and avoid repeating myself, I
created this class:

<https://gist.github.com/mhulse/5860561>

Inspired by WPAlchemy, I thought it would be cool to create my custom
widgets like so:

[code]

$medium_rectangle_1 = new foo_Widget(
    array(
        'id_base' => 'medium_rectangle_1',
        'name' => 'Medium Rectangle 1',
        'description' => 'Standard Advertising Unit',
        'template' => STYLESHEETPATH .
'/includes/widgets/medium-rectangle-1.php',
    )
);

[/code]

Unfortunately, I keep getting this PHP notice:

[snip]

Notice: Undefined property: Foo_Widget::$option_name in
/.../wp-includes/widgets.php on line 291 Warning: array_merge():
Argument #2 is not an array in /.../wp-includes/widgets.php on line
777

[/snip]

... and the widget does not show in the admin (well, there's an empty,
useless, widget box with no label).

Now, I know my code could use some more work (I'm kinda pushing the
limits of my WP/PHP skillz) ... I just wanted to see if anyone here
had any tips as to what I might be doing wrong?

Thanks!
M

Oops, typo: That should be "new Foo_Widget(...". With a capital "F".

Kind of hard to debug your code having no idea what version of wordpress you're using. Someone would have to download your thing and run it himself to figure out what's going on. A version number would be helpful for on-the-fly debugging.

Also, Xdebug.

Thanks for the feedback. I apologize for lack of WordPress version.

I'm running version 3.5.1.

I'll try to create a simple version of my code. I'm pretty sure I get
the same errors when I remove everything but the very basic code.

Thanks for the kick in the pants! :)

Well, here's a new version of my code:

https://gist.github.com/mhulse/5861847

I tried to boil it down to just the basics.

Now that I've simplified the code, I think I discovered a core problem:

----------

In Foo_Widget's constructor, this works:

parent::__construct('eeeeeeeeee', 'wtf son?', $widget_ops, $control_ops);

... but this does not:

parent::__construct($id_base, $name, $widget_ops, $control_ops);

Why can't I pass $id_base and $name as string variables to the parent
WP_Widget constructor?

----------

I feel like the above issue could be the root of my problems.

Another question:

----------

In Foo_Widget's constructor, if I do this:

... __construct($arr) ...

I get this PHP notice:

"Undefined variable: arr in /.../class.foo_widget.php on line 9".

If I change the constructor to this:

... __construct($arr = array()) ...

... the PHP notice goes away.

Why does this happen?

Shouldn't $arr be defined by the time it reaches line #9? Is this a WP
timing thing, or just a general PHP5 OOP constructor thing that I've
never been privy to? :D

I don't mind setting a default argument value here, it just feels
overkill and I've never run into this type of "notice" before.

----------

With all that said, I hope you folks can see what I'm trying to do.
Basically, I would like to wrap WP_Widget in a Class which has some
customizations, and then call my custom widget class like so:


[code]

include_once('class.foo_widget.php');

$foo_test_widget_1 = new Foo_Widget(
    array(
        'id_base' => 'foo_test_widget_1',
        'name' => 'Foo Test Widget 1'
    )
);

$foo_test_widget_2 = new Foo_Widget(
    array(
        'id_base' => 'foo_test_widget_2',
        'name' => 'Foo Test Widget 2'
    )
);

[/code]

... and so on.

Maybe what I'm trying to do isn't feasible? All the examples I've seen
show a new class for each new widget; this is what I'm doing now, and
that technique works great ... I just thought it would be even better
if I could create new widgets using the syntax above (i.e. one custom
widget class that extends WP_Widget where the name/title/other are
passed during instantiation).

I hope that helps to clarify what I'm trying to do.

I guess, at this point, I'm look for tips ... I feel like I'm close to
getting this code to work ... I'm kinda confused as to why I can't
seem to pass variables to the WP_Widget constructor but hard-coded
strings work no problems.

Thanks for listening.

Micky

Just as an update, a few folks have been helping me out in the
comments of my latest gist:

https://gist.github.com/mhulse/5861847

It's looking like it's not possible for me to instantiate my custom
widget in the way that I desire.

I guess I'll stick to the more standard way of creating widgets (e.g.
one class, that extends WP_Widget, per new custom widget).

Thanks for pro/guru help Dobri and JD, I really appreciate it!!!
Thanks to everyone for listening.

Have an excellent day.

Cheers,
Micky

Hey Micky, I was thinking about this and I think I've found a good solution for you. Just extend the Foo_Widget class with child classes like this:


class Foo_Widget_2 extends Foo_Widget {

	function __construct() {
	
		parent::__construct(
			array(
				'id_base' => 'foo_test_widget',
				'name' => 'Foo Test Widget'
			)
		);
	}
}

I've tested this and it works fine as far as I can tell.

Interesting!

You know, that's not much more typing than my desired way of doing it.
I'll play around with your suggestion. :)

In fact, what you have posted is kinda close to my current setup:

<https://gist.github.com/mhulse/5864117>

(see "3. class.foo_widget_1.php",
https://gist.github.com/mhulse/5864117#file-3-class-foo_widget_1-php)

The above was about as modular as I could make it without doing a lot
of repeating of code.

Anyway, thanks for the tip off. I'll play with your idea. I like the
thought of using Foo_Widget() as the code is all in one class file
(compared to the code linked to above, which uses a few different
classes to do things ... Six of one, half dozen of the other, but I
think I'd prefer Foo_Widget() and extending like you show).

Thanks again! I'll be back with my updated code/findings. :)

Message-ID: <CANtG5LM0fHPd37fDS=kVYKFpPO3BqxJaxGjVF352iVe0rxNp7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Hackers,

I'm using Posts 2
Posts<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/posts-to-posts/description/>
plugin
to create connection for artists and posts. This way the site can display
the artist details and connected posts (news/photo galleries/videos) about
the artist on a single page.

I modified the single-artist.php to show the artist details (primary loop)
and connected posts (secondary loop) below it. I can get the connected post
and paginate them by the following code but the pagination links are not
working.

// Find connected posts
$connected = new WP_Query( array(
    'connected_type' => 'artists_to_posts',
    'connected_items' => get_queried_object(),
    'paged' => (get_query_var('page')) ? get_query_var('page') : 1,
) );

As a result, when I am going to
http://localhost/artist/artist-name/page/2 redirects
me back to http://localhost/artist/artist-name/ so I can't go to the
paginated links and can only see the most recent connected posts.

Here is:

*single-artist.php<https://gist.github.com/iammahmudur/19d944872cfac1c285cf>
*

I know the single post template is only meant to show the current post, so
I'm not sure what should I do in this case. Hope someone can give me a
clue.

Have you tried get_query_var( 'paged' ) instead?

Hi

I have tried that as well. But no luck.

The pagination links are part of a secondary loop on a single page
template. And I can see that get_query_var('paged') always returning 1. As
a result the pagination links are not working.

Is it possible to paginate through a secondary loop on a *single page
template*? For example, on a single page template can I have a URL like
below:

http://localhost/artist/artist-name/page/2

Here is the link for:

single-artist.php <https://gist.github.com/iammahmudur/19d944872cfac1c285cf>
loop-artist.php <https://gist.github.com/iammahmudur/8f38979f143cdc668ff9>

Pagination code on functions.php<https://gist.github.com/iammahmudur/5881276>

Many thanks.

Does it work if you add the page number as a GET parameter?

For Example, http://localhost/artist/artist-name/?page=2

Hi

If I set the page number as a GET parameter then it works for the first
loop/primary loop and not for the secondary loop. As a result the URL
becomes:

http://localhost/artist/artist-name/2/<http://localhost/artist/artist-name/?page=2>

Here is the response (WP_Query Object) for the first loop:

https://gist.github.com/iammahmudur/88beda1b000acd806144

And here is the response (WP_Query Object) for the second loop:

https://gist.github.com/iammahmudur/2b526713a14fb3b8fd05

How can I set the 'page' parameter for the second loop?

Many thanks.

Hi,

This is now working. I have changed the arguments for my second query as
given below:

// Find connected posts
$connected = new WP_Query( array(
    'connected_type' => 'artists_to_posts',
    'connected_items' => get_queried_object(),
    'paged' => (get_query_var('page')) ? get_query_var('page') : 1,
) );

Thanks for your help.

Cheers.

Mahmudur

Subject: [wp-hackers] Enforced magic quotes?
Message-ID: <51CD3818.9030206@wordshell.net>

Hi,

Today, after a lot of debugging, I came across a fact that after a 
decade tinkering with WordPress had somehow escaped me... apparently, 
WordPress enforces behaviour as if PHP's (deprecated, now removed) 
magic_quotes_gpc was always on. (Not 'always off', as most (all?) other 
frameworks... which is what I'd merrily assumed for years).

Codex (http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/stripslashes_deep) 
says that this is " WordPress does this because too much core and plugin 
code has come to rely on the quotes being there".

That's rather unfortunate (that WP took the opposite approach to PHP - 
PHP decided the long-term solution was "always, permanently off"; WP 
decided "always on") - are we stuck with this forever, or is there a 
plan to reverse it at some point? Are sane plugin authors doomed (as it 
says on http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.whynot.php), 
to be permanently having the maintenance/performance burden of WP always 
adding unwanted slashes, and then we remove them?

David

Message-ID: <CAOwx47foMSEhz7=ETd1Hgg-3EngEYAwN7Mye4RnA-1okVDHtCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm currently working on a (yet-another)multilingual plugin for WordPress.
I'm willing to add an uninstall functionality that would allow the user to
remove all data created by the plugin(so any options, custom meta, posts,
terms, etc). The plugin works by creating a duplicate post/term in a custom
post type/taxonomy for each enabled language.

I've noticed that when I have for instance 7 enabled languages and I want
to delete a bunch of posts, my WAMP installation would time-out at 60
seconds if I try to delete more than probably 10 posts, since I hook to the
delete_post hook and use wp_delete_post to remove the corresponding
translation posts - which means, that wp_delete_post is actually called for
up to 80 posts.

I realize that wp_delete_post is generally a heavy function, since deletes
all post meta, comments(?), etc.

What I'm wondering is whether I should use wp_delete_post or if there would
be a different approach to deleting multiple files with less load on the
server. Obviously if I stick to wp_delete_post(), I would use ajax-driven
uninstall process which would only delete a handful of posts at a time.

I assume one way to beat the timeout would be to try to use
set_time_limit() whenever I delete translation posts, but obviously I can't
use this solution for plugin uninstallation, since there could be a lot of
data(let's say a thousands-of-posts situation).

If this is a one-off operation, use php directly, from the command line:

php <your-bulk-delete-program>.php

You may need to load WordPress in your program.  For an example, see wp-cron.php

It should be a one-time operation indeed, but the question is how would I
use the command-line from inside PHP itself - the idea is that (for
instance)the user would go to a page and click a button that will then
trigger the uninstall process.

It should work on various set-ups and in some cases(well maybe most, I'm
not sure), you won't be able to execute CLI commands from PHP itself, since
that will be disabled.

This has been discussed at excruciating length for the past few years.
Welcome to the rabbit hole. Enjoy your stay!

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22325
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18322

Additionally, WordPress 3.6 will be introducing some new wrapper
functions for dealing with slashes, and various API functions are
being changed to accept unslashed data instead of slashed. See

I think the best way is using AJAX to delete the posts in batches. A bonus for this method is, that the user has visual feedback about the process. Much better than waiting for a page refresh that might not even happen.

Best,

Yeah - I guess that this will be my choice at the end - just wanted to
check if someone else has any better ideas.

I'll also have to look into not timing out the Posts page when the user
batch-deletes multiple posts/pages. But that's another story.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Introducing Resource Chainer
Message-ID: <E9E6728A-096B-4364-8D08-8B251B7C216B@matthiasbreuer.com>

Hi all,

For the last few weeks I have been using my spare time to work on a resource concatenation plugin that kind of works like wp minify minus the minify part. I tested the plugin on a variety of installations and for me it works great. Before releasing the plugin into the wild however I'd like some real dev feedback.

My aim was to keep things simply, that's why there is no UI or automatic minifying. The plugin uses filters when appropriate to allow other devs to build minifying on top of it or exclude certain scripts/styles.

If you want to give it a try download the repository at https://github.com/matthiasbreuer/resource-chainer/tree/release/1.0.0

I'd love some feedback from all of you!

Best,
Matthias

	plugin
Message-ID: <CAOwx47c6R5MNWEUATZW2N8EcnNqefL6tHcpkR8xAbCKgoFOrrA@mail.gmail.com>

About 7 months ago I started developing a plugin for multilingual content -
with the intention to replace the now slow and buggy qTranslate. I've been
working on it mostly in my free time and when I had nothing to do at work.

I'm glad to say that it's finally getting into a presentable shape and I
would love if someone wishes to help me with testing the plugin in various
configurations.

You can find the code on GitHub -
https://github.com/nikolov-tmw/multilingual-wp . You can download either
version 0.1(it's tagged), or download the latest code(which I would kind of
recommend in order to explore the latest features - well not that many
compared to the "stable" version 0.1, but still).

Please take a look at the Issues page
https://github.com/nikolov-tmw/multilingual-wp/issues in order to see
what's still not fully functional/doesn't exist.

Now a bit about how the plugin works - it generally registers a custom post
type for every language and every post type that the user selects on the
plugin's settings screen(by default only "Post" and "Page" are selected).
Then for every existing post "n" translation posts are created in the
corresponding custom post types, where "n" is the number of enabled
languages. The cloned posts are generally almost the same - they start with
the same title as the original posts, same publish date, same
tags/categories, etc.
Taxonomies are handled in similar fashion - except that initially the
translation terms get "||xx" appended to their Title(where "xx" is the
language code) - otherwise WordPress creates kind of "clone" terms which
change when the original one is changed.

I've tried using as much built-in functionality as possible and using
filter/action hooks in order to make the plugin work - thus hoping for
better compatibility with future versions of WordPress and less maintenance
on my end.

The plugin supports a lot of customization regarding permalinks - you can
change the "page" part of paginated URL's for each language, you can change
almost all of the english-defaulting parts of the URL to better match each
language.

You can have different slug for each taxonomy(like you can have "category"
different in each language), post type, etc.

There's also support for the Google XML Sitemaps plugin (
http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/ ), which extends the
sitemap and generates entries for each language.

Generally I'm very happy with my work so far, but it's impossible for me to
test it in all possible variations - different themes/plugin/etc. That's
why I'm looking for help - if anyone is interested in giving me a hand with
that - I would highly appreciate it.

If you decide to do so, please file any bugs you find on the Issues page on
GitHub(as mentioned earlier in this message).

Just a note - the plugin will not become paid in any point in the future -
it will remain free for anyone to use. It's "copyleft"-ed and licensed
under the GPL v.3 license.

PS: so far there are two production sites(for which I know) that are using
my plugin - one of them is my small blog - themoonwatch.com .


Thank you for your time,
Nikola Nikolov

I would really appreciate some comparison table type thing on "how is 
this any better than WPML (or other established multi-lingual plugins, 
there are more than just qT)"

Well the first and obvious difference - it's free, compared to WPML. As far
as I'm aware - WPML creates additional tables in the database - and
honestly I'm kind of really annoyed by such plugins(especially when you
end-up with double the number of tables just by one plugin). Of course just
the fact that it's free doesn't make it better. Actually I would probably
recommend WPML for a company, since their CMS version is very affordable,
especially if used in multiple projects. And it has one year of support and
upgrades - which is pretty cool.

Like I said - initially I started working on it as a replacement for
qTranslate - since it was buggy and slow and all of that. Initially I'll be
targeting mainly users of qTranslate - offering them a way to move on to a
better-working and better-supported plugin. That's why I've created a
migration tool which automatically moves the content from qTranslate to my
plugin.

Honestly - I haven't intensively used almost any other multilingual plugins
- I've tried a couple of them and I can't say they're bad at all.

Another aspect - by creating my own plugin I get:
    a) better understanding on how WordPress works
    b) experience in developing in PHP

So, you can also look on this as a self-improving project, besides
everything else.

Now - to answer your actual request - I will do my best to try out multiple
plugins in the next couple of weeks so that I can gather information and
make that comparison.

Thanks for your input,
Nikola Nikolov

I've had a bunch of experience with WPML now and can say that 
multi-lingual is a complicated thing to attack. Much more complicated 
than it appears at first sight.

I guess it depends on what your scope is, but to gain any sort of real 
market share eventually your plugin will need to solve a whole bunch of 
issues.

>> I would really appreciate some comparison table type thing on "how is this
>> any better than WPML (or other established multi-lingual plugins, there are

If you come up with a good comparison matrix in your github README.md, 
that alone is quite great value.

On http://comparewp.org/ you will find a link to a google doc where a first rough start for comparison has been done.
You could add your plugin there and fill it in.

Wow, nice.

This effort will eventually be CMS-d right? I can already see each of 
the feature boxes could use real world experience commentary from users..

Hey Marko, thanks for the link!

I've sent an email using their contact form and until they reply, you can
check-out the modified version of the document(you can't edit the one
linked to from their site) here -
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At0iw59f82GhdG5OelJfTWhWNEx6enhJV25WaEU0Ymc&usp=sharing
 .

I guess my plugin doesn't stand that bad, taking into account that it's
still in beta. Of course I know that no other developer has actually
confirmed the information about their plugin, so it might not be all true.

For a bit of history:
When PHP first introduced the magic_quotes feature, it was permanently on,
Then there was an option to disable it (but recommended NOT to disable
magic quotes). WordPress based on the PHP developers guidelines at the
time, decided to ease the pain for Plugin & Theme developers who possibly
weren't PHP experts, and were not aware of edge case installations, chose
to standardise the PHP Environment to a single "sane" environment,
something developers could rely upon.
However, years later, the core PHP Developers realised their mistake, and
that  defaulting to off was a much more sane approach, and changed it.. Of
course, that has left WordPress in a difficult spot, as Plugins and Themes
RELY upon WordPress to be quoting things, just turning it off causes all
sorts of breakages (slashes in posts, SQL vulnerabilities in old plugins,
and new plugins even, etc) and just isn't possible.
As mentioned in a previous reply, the solution going forward is a new API
and helper functions, it's a issue that's being actively worked upon in
other words.

You probably don't realise it, but, magic_quotes are not the only thing
that WordPress does for developers, just off the top of my head we also
standardise Error reporting levels, register_globals (We force it off by
undoing it's work), various $_SERVER paths and uri's (so many different PHP
configs and server environments cause those indexes to be unset, set
incorrectly, or unreliable), and I'm sure there's even more things I'm
missing..

tl;dr: WordPress isn't totally insane :)

Hi J.D.,

I finally had a chance to test your suggestion using my test
Foo_Widget class. Unfortunately, I'm getting the same results as
before.

[snip]

include_once('class.foo_widget.php');

class Foo_Widget_2 extends Foo_Widget {

    function __construct() {

        parent::__construct(
            array(
                'id_base' => 'foo_test_widget',
                'name' => 'Foo Test Widget',
            )
        );

    }
}

new Foo_Widget_2();

[/snip]

The above gets include_once into my functions.php.

This is the Foo_Widget() class (same one from before):

<https://gist.github.com/mhulse/5861847>

When I test the above code, I just see an empty widget under
"Available Widgets". When inspecting with Firebug, neither "id_base"
or "name" made it through.

If it's not too much trouble, could you confirm that the code you are
using is the same as the stuff I'm using?

If you got it to work, I must be doing something wrong (or, maybe I
need to upgrade to the latest WP? We're one version behind).

Thanks so much! I owe you one! :-)

Hi Micky,

You need to register the widget with the register_widget() function like this:

function myplugin_register_widgets() {
	register_widget( 'Foo_Widget_2' );
}
add_action( 'widgets_init', 'myplugin_register_widgets' );

Then it should work.

Nikola, thanks for contributing to that very important question.

As Marko says, having a feature comparison table is a great thing. Who
is maintaining that one?

There are some other multilanguage plugins that might be added to the survey:

Multisite Language Switcher (46'607 downloads)
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multisite-language-switcher/

Multilingual Press (27'614 downloads)
by Inpsyde GmbH
http://wordpress.org/plugins/multilingual-press/
(there's also a paid version, Multilingual Press Pro)

Babble
by Simon Wheatley (Code for the People)
https://github.com/simonwheatley/babble

Anyone been using them?

For sure, providing solid solutions for multilingual websites is one
of the big upcoming challenges for WordPress.

Here's an interesting twitter discussion thread on that topic, featuring Nacin:
https://twitter.com/nacin/status/270975913754238976

Best,
Manuel

Maybe you are, because it's still there, and it's still called
page_comments. On the options-discussion screen.

Ahh, that makes sense. Thank you for the clarification, I really appreciate it.

I assumed that I did not need to register_widget() because I have that
in the class I'm extending.

add_action(
'widgets_init',
function() {
register_widget(__CLASS__);
}
);

Maybe if I passed __CLASS__ from the child class into the parent
class's register_widget()? I'll have to play around with that.

Either way, thanks to your help, I now have a better understanding of
WP widgets. Thanks so much for your help and guidance. :)

Thanks again to everyone who has given me help.

Cheers,
Micky

I think you could do this instead of using __CLASS__:
$class = get_class( $this );
See here:

I'm not sure if that works in all versions of PHP, but according to the poster there it works in 5.2.9.

Ooooh, that's cool!

get_class($this) looks really convenient. I'll play around with that.

Thanks again J.D.! You rock! :)

Have an awesome weekend.

By the way you can also do the registration of all widgets in one function.
Store all of your widget classes in a static variable in your "Foo_Widget"
class - like "self::$registered_widgets[] = get_class( $this );"

And then you can add the action like this:

if ( ! has_action( 'widgets_init', array( 'Foo_Widget', 'register_widgets'
) ) ) {
    add_action( 'widgets_init', array( 'Foo_Widget', 'register_widgets' ) );
}

And then in your static "register_widgets" function, you can loop through
"self::$registered_widgets" and call register_widget() with each class
name.

Of course, you'll have to define "$registered_widgets" as a static array in
your class first :)

Your best bet is to offload this onto wp-cron, which runs without a
timelimit (similar to CLI) in the background.

Oooh, that's a good idea! I'm looking forward to playing with this technique.

After I've experimented, I may be back with some questions. ;)

Thank you Nikola! I really appreciate the help!

I always thought wp-cron is running as a synchronous process when not called via real cronjobs. Is it done asynchronously?

wp-cron wont run unless someone actually hits the site right? so if you
have zero visitors it wont run? with crontab it will.

maybe i am mistaken.
