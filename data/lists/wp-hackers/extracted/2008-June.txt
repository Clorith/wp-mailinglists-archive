 wonder why someone hasn't created a TinyMCE plugin for syntax
highlighting. Maybe one clicks a button which opens a pop up where the
code is pasted, and only something like [code-listing-#] where # is
the number of the code listing. Then when the post is, well, posted,
it interprets that as the code using some type of filter (Of course
that would mean that the code would have to be inserted into a
database on its own). Pretty complicated but it's the only way I can
imagine being able to use syntax highlighting plugins with TinyMCE, or
does anyone else know another way?

I think that what I meant in that paragraph is something like this:

What do you guys think about it? I myself have been using reCAPTCHA (I'm the
developer for the official plugin for wordpress:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-recaptcha/ ) but of course I'm open
to new solutions. I gave up on Akismet after having to continuously check
the queue to make sure that it didn't eat something up that it wasn't
supposed to, defeating the point of it being automatic.

Because not everyone uses TinyMCE (I don't for example).

That's true, but that's why I said a 'TinyMCE Plugin'. I too used to not use
the TinyMCE Plugin, I used to just type raw XHTML and obviously I had more
freedom back then. I recently switched to TinyMCE though and I feel myself
being more productive. Not that I type slow or anything, but I can
concentrate on the content rather than the coding (Yes, I know it's not
complicated coding or anything).

Do you use any other WYSIWYG editor? Like I said, I come from the
non-WYSIWYG editor world but I recently switched, and it's annoying when
elitists go around saying 'durrr just dont use teh tinymce edit0r d00d!,
gr0w j00r epen1s!'. The TinyMCE editor is there for a reason and most casual
bloggers use it. I'm not limiting myself to TinyMCE but I don't know of any
other editor that works well with WordPress, do you have any suggestions?

I know HTML better than any script ever will and I don't want extra HTML
needlessly being put into my posts. That's why I don't use RTEs. ;)

Plus, I find it no faster, even slower perhaps as I have to fiddle with it,
than just clicking buttons to insert bold, etc.

Yeah that's how it used to be with me. It doesn't add any extra HTML for me
anymore (In other words it doesn't make it like if you exported to HTML in
MS Word or something), maybe it's been 'fixed' in recent versions. Also the
whole bold deal, that's as simple as CTRL+B :P Some things like images take
longer but after getting used to it it could be pretty instant.

I just gave it a quick look, from a coder's perspective. Looks rather
clean, compared to Defensio which code is awfully messy and doesnt
show any WordPress knowing.

I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use 2 similar plugins (ie, plugins
supposed to try and learn from mistakes). I mean, if one plugin catch
a spam that's in fact a ham, or the other way round, the other plugin
won't know and won't learn ?
Definitely sticking to Akismet for now :)

Yeah, the Defensio source is a huge mess, although this one isn't too much
better. I really wish more people would use PHP classes for their plugins.
It's sooo much nicer.

But anyway, I'm stickin' with Defensio. I can't argue with it's
spam-catching accuracy (although it had a little trouble with marking
legitimate pingbacks as spam in the beginning):

(since March 23rd, 2008)

119799 spam
383 legitimate comments
56 false negatives (undetected spam)
34 false positives (legitimate comments identified as spam)

Not sure if anyone caught this in the new TypePad AntiSpam service
announcement.
http://antispam.typepad.com/blog/2008/05/welcome.html

Interestingly enough, they are releasing the core code as GPL v2 for the
AntiSpam service!
Latest subversion: http://code.sixapart.com/svn/antispam/

I am not a Perl guru to appreciate the code, but it sounds like a bold move
by TypePad.
Especially considering that they are promising the service to be free for
any, including probloggers and enterprises.

And the API is exactly like Akismet's. The plugin should be easy. And  
there's also mollum: http://mollom.com/ frome the drupal guys.

Hello list,

Just wondering if anyone here could tell me how long it normally
takes for a newly registered plugin to be approved at wp.org/extend?

I registered a new one may 28th and the page says Approved: 2008-5-30.
But there is no menu which normally would say:
    * Description
    * Installation
    * Faq
    * Screenshots
    * Other Notes
    * Stats
    * Admin

I've never used wp.org/extend and I'm not sure what to expect, nor when.

Thanx for any assistance or info.

Not really hackers.
It'll take as long as it takes, until someone gets round to it.
There are instructions on completion on how to get the separate information
pages

Sometimes it takes them a while to approve the plugin and create the 
repository, but once you have access to the repository and check in your 
files, it takes about 15 minutes.  All that info comes from your 
readme.txt file in your trunk directory.  Make sure you've read up on 
the readme.txt format, etc.  If you have specific questions, you can 
contactme off list and I'll take a look at your repository to see what 
might be happening.

Thanx guys,
I have the readme format clear.
I thought maybe there was a glitch in my registry process.
As it says approved, but there's no access.
And I don't recall any instructions on completion on how to get
the separate information pages.

would my svn be :
http://svn.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/myPluginName

You'll get your svn info by E-Mail when it's been approved.

I had never heard of Defensio, I thought it was Akismet haha. So you guys
think Defensio is better than Akismet?

My latest plugin just got submitted, approved, and committed all
within 25 minutes. It can take several days (or even weeks for some)
though, so be patient and your time will come :)

Well you said 'latest' so I'm assuming you've submitted more, I just
submitted my first one a few weeks ago (WP-reCAPTCHA) and it took about a
week or so. I guess after a few plugins of having uploaded you start to get
reputation/priority which allows you to get to the top of the approval list.

I can[1] tell you it's not the case :)
I think it's just a couple of guys checking the queue of awaiting
plugins, and sometimes they're just too busy.

How is it not the case, you have tons of plugins up there...or are you just
trying to show off? If so, here's a pat on the back and a thumbs up to you
:)

I only have two plugins:

But yeah you're probably right.

My point was just that it doesn't get any faster after you have one or
10 plugins. I've once had a plugin approved within 10 minutes, and my
latest plugin was approved after like 10 days and an email I shoot to
ask if everything was ok. It's just random delay.

Wow, I didn't mean to create such a huge discussion.  There was some
good pro/con going on however.

Was a decision made?

Only WP-Spamfree catches 100% of spam, but I like to use hive  
solutions, and I like to be able to feed the firewall with spammy IPs  
harvested from spam submissions* (which can't happen with WP-SpamFree,  
since spam never gets into the comments table to begin with). Akismet  
does seem to be letting a lot more spam through to the moderation  
queue in recent weeks, which has been annoying. I'm running the  
TypePad plugin now, and it seems to be doing a somewhat better job  
than Akismet (but that's not scientific).

Would be interesting to see someone set up a handful of equivalent  
honeypot sites, publicize them equally, and have each run a different  
spam solution. Then we could run some interesting comparative numbers.

/** Do you use any other WYSIWYG editor? **/

I remember trying out tinyFCK editor a year back.  I was using nusphere
plugin, but due to some compatability problems, i manually replaced existing
tinyMCE with latest version of it.

I felt, tinyFCK is somewhat faster than tinyMCE.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Parent-Child Themes and New Page Templates
Message-ID: <a8405fa30806020945r75b1120ewd6f5384519adafe6@mail.gmail.com>

PROBLEM: I can make new, CSS-only, child themes by including "TEMPLATE:
define-parent-theme-here" in the comments of my stylesheet, inheriting all
the page templates of a parent theme. I can override and add new functions
by including a functions.php file with this child theme. BUT! What if I want
to add new page templates? Can I add foo.php or bar.php in the folder of my
child theme and make it available in WRITE > PAGE?

EXAMPLE:

sandbox
..header.php, sidebar.php, etc.
..links.php
..archives.php
[links and archives are existing custom template files]

child-theme
..style.css
..functions.php
..foo.php
..bar.php
[foo and bar are new page templates that should become available when child
theme is the active theme?but they currently don't]

BONUS: Why would I want to do this? More custom themes, less work.

A blog is a blog is a blog: most custom theming work happens on the home
page. Make a new home-page.php file in a child theme and with some fun CSS
and javascript you can make a host of easily maintained themes; most of the
code is recycled from the pristine "parent theme". Imagine a hundred clients
with drastically different sites, all with easily upgraded code: overwrite
the parent theme, tweak home-page.php. Done.

This should also add a lot more options and possibilities to the coming
WordPress Theme Marketplace, speeding up theme vetting (most of the code
being inherited from The Sandbox) while providing some even more
dramatically new variations.

Anyone know how to do this?

Or don't. How you do things is up to you and you alone, and the codex
is not right in all circumstances (or even most of them, in fact).

In this particular case, there is some debate on the subject, so you
do what you think is right.

I put my plugin configuration pages on the Plugins menu, not the
Settings menu. And I will continue to do so.

Hi Guys,

I have noticed two things:
- The combination of the Words WordPress and Hack mostly return topics
about making WP do cool things (the spirit of this mailing list)
- Most requests for info about fixing hacked blogs are dead ends on
wordpress.org

Today I am trying to fix a hacked blog without simply starting over. I
want to know what happened to create the following problem:

All request in the address bar to ANY wp-admin files returns a 404 error.

the .htaccess file seems clean.

All files were at 2.5.1

I have already overwritten all files in sequence to spot which one
would have rogue code.

I checked the theme it seems fine (no encoded bits of javascript or rogue code)

I have removed the javascript functions at the bottom of the index.php
that a bot inserts everyday on the site.

Your pointers will definitely help me understand the source of the issue.

What is your opinion on the usefullness of this plugin?
http://www.askapache.com/wordpress/htaccess-password-protect.html

(I know this is easely done the classic way but don't we all have a
gazillion blogs to manage!?!)


Thanks a lot,

WP-Spamfree does not "catch" any spam, it simply prevents a client
without javascript from submitting a comment. Adding a manual hidden
field into your comment submission is just as effective, and also will
not block blind and other disabled people from commenting (which
WP-Spamfree does, as many of those browsers do not process
javascript).

I refer you to our conversation back in April on this topic:

Here's a few things that would be useful to know:

Are you sure Wordpress was the point of entry for the attack?

What kind of hosting? ie, shared/dedicated.

I've been talking to Marie, and from what I can see there are no affected
Wordpress files, there are some silly 777's, but all the files have either
been refreshed or checked manually. Nothing seems to be in the directory
that the blog is, either.
It's strange. 
How else would that 404 be achieved, without editing any files. Also, a
javascript tag has attached itself to the bottom of the </html> on each
page.

(I'm replying because I've been talking to Marie for the last half hour :) )

I was about to say something witty because I thought it was another 
cracker trying to get some info. There is probably a hole somewhere in 
the software if this is continuing to happen. I would try to look at the 
logs and see if there is an IP address trying to access some weird URL 
string. If there's nothing there, I would see if it may be something 
else on the server creating a vulnerability in MySQL allowing them to 
add an administrator account to the database.

The only odd thing I found was a file in the /wp-content/ called
index.php which has an encrypted javascript call.

removing it didn't change anything.

Hi Dave,

The database has been picked over and is clean.

Either this is a brilliant WP Hack or it is not even a WP Hack.

We also think it is Bluehost specific.

Thanks for your input!

Shared hosting has the potential to get ugly, fast.

Basically, you are potentially vulnerable to script insecurities on 
other domains hosted there. I think it is very safe to say it had 
nothing to do with WP.

Well of course it's on shared hosting as most other WP installations.

I am reinstalling my way (not the fantastico way) from scratch and we
will see what happens in the next 24 hours. I have documented that all
necessary precautions are taken so when it becomes hacked again
Bluehost will not be able to hide its head in the sand.

Thanks for all your help today, espescially George (Pearce) who walked
me through a lot of checks I had not thought about.

On a hilarious aside: About a year ago, the CEO of Bluehost's blog 
hacked / spam injected.

Is Bluehost a good place to host blogs? (historically)

Currently my list is:

1and1 - The Best
Dreamhost - People seem to recommend it a lot but haven't used it yet.

Never worked for me:

A small orange
Yahoo Small Business Host

I used to use 1and1 but they're too 'corporate' and not 'flexible', I
currently use DreamHost and really like it. They have a nice automatic
installation and upgrade of WordPress which is really nice, it's not half
as*ed or anything, it really works (As long as you haven't modified any core
files, and if you have, when dreamhost upgrades wordpress it copies your
entire site folder so you can simply diff and merge them together).

Hi Everyone,

My client is back up and running on a fresh WP 2.5.1 install.

The culprit of the whole redirect debacle with /wp-admin is exactly
the one I mentioned in my first post. I was able to re-create the
problem when everything worked fine and I re-activated THAT one.

Ask Apache WordPress Protector
http://www.askapache.com/wordpress/htaccess-password-protect.html

Could be an incompatibility with another plug in. I will have to test
this at some point.

Right now I'd rather be watching my new favorite porn: The Tudors.

Marie-Lynn
The Friendly Webmaster

Subject: [wp-hackers] Allow Wordpress to use a Slave Database
Message-ID: <4845223A.2040103@colinogilvie.co.uk>

I filed this as a ticket on trac, but also felt it might be worth 
emailing it to this mailing list.

At work (http://community.plus.net/) we have found that we are sometimes 
hitting our MySQL connection limits (although we do tweak them). We also 
have a replication setup where there is a slave database which is idle 
as Wordpress does not allow you to connect to it.

We have been looking at adding the option to use a slave database, and 
have attached an initial patch to http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7081 
which we have submitted.

We would appreciate any feedback on this from others.

Thanks

Colin

A handy feature to have, although why not just use an object cache (I use an
XCache-powered one on my personal blog) or go full static with
WP-Super-Cache (I use that as well on another site of mine).

Using a persistent object cache will cut your queries in half and using
WP-Super-Cache will cut them to essentially 0.

MySQL replication is simply more scalable if you have a lot of data
(i.e. not single user),

Even you are comparing with memcached (not those local file/memory
kind of caching...).

No. WP only looks for templates in the template directory. I'd like to
see it patched so that any template file existing in the stylesheet
directory takes precedence. Is that something you could do?

I'm not sure that reducing the number of queries will help if he's
hitting the MySQL Connection limits (although, of course, super-cache
would certainly help).

I do like the idea of being able to optionally provide a different
connection for cases where you are going to execute select statements
only (reads, basically). But with WordPress, I'm not certain that it
would help a lot with regard to the number of connections. WordPress
does do some updates pretty much all the time, what with the options
table getting updates so often for some plugins and such.

Once again, I wish MySQL was capable of bi-directional replication.

Have you tried HyperDB? It's what we use on WordPress.com to
distribute queries among slaves. It also detects write queries and
sends them to masters.

http://svn.wp-plugins.org/hyperdb/trunk/

HyperDB has fallen behind WPDB (e.g. it lacks the new prepare and
update methods) so it needs some attention but nothing terribly
difficult. I'm sure the maintainers would be happy to see a patch from
you.

http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/hyperdb

Then again, if its capabilities were smartly integrated into WPDB it
could be even more beneficial.

Just need to make sure auto increment ID will not conflict with other
node, then master-to-master replication is easy to setup, right now.

I'd thought about using that, but I'd rather see it implemented in the
core than having to use different plugins and other DB files which, as
you said, start to lag behind the core.

Also, hyperdb seems to be a bit advanced for what we were actually
wanting to do.

I agree. I'd like to see WPDB gain simple slave awareness without
sacrificing anything for single-db installs. If you do it, I hope you
do it as a core patch with those goals met. Ping me if you need help.

Well, yeah, but then that's sort of the problem, isn't it? It works
fine if you don't mind dealing with setting auto_increment_increment
and auto_increment_offset everywhere and then dealing with big gaps in
your auto-increment table. Auto-increment columns are pretty much
everywhere, having them look all strange by using offsets and such
just strikes me as a strange and somewhat annoying way to go.

I grant that it's the simplest solution, and simple is always good,
but it somehow offends my sense of beauty. :)

Sure, master-to-master setup is only for realtime, write hungry applications.

Personally, if I really hit that limit, I would think about reduce the
number of write or update per request.

E.g. Use of memcached for temp storage and write to DB in a batch.

I second Andy's suggestion.  I was looking at the Hyper DB source  
again just last week, with idea of making the core WordPress database  
class write versus read aware.

This was the idea I was considering:

	- Be able to configure 1 (or more?  multi-master?) MySQL database  
that writes are sent to
	- Define 1 or more (array) of MySQL database servers to send reads to
	- This should require zero changes to queries, plugins, other core  
files/code beyond the database class and config info above

That last requirement is something that Hyper DB does by inspecting  
the queries to determine if they will perform a write.  My suggestion  
would be to take the useful bits from Hyper DB and add them to the  
core WordPress database class.

In a word, no. The spirit is willing but my code is weak.

That said, that would be an awesome development in WordPress theming. Adding
new template files from the stylesheet directory and overriding existing
ones would be a huge advance.

Hey all,

On Friday, I released the plugin that I've been emailing you all about.  
I've gotten some useful feedback from users, but I'd love to get some 
feedback from fellow developers, especially since this is my first 
Wordpress plugin.

Generally speaking, the plugin automatically generates a flash slideshow 
displaying the site's most popular posts.  I've attached a screenshot to 
give you an idea of what it can do.  If you've got a spare moment, take 
a look.

Hi Guy,

How about borrow the codes (or concept) from wikipedia, rather than
reinventing the wheel, they have a quite good database access modules
which is able to a lot of these stuffs such as load balancing, HA
ect...

There is some good stuff in that patch and it looks like a good start
but I would not be quick to commit it to core. It does not consider
replication lag. It supports only one slave. The new bail has an
inappropriate message. The coding style could be more consistent.
(Aren't I critical?)

The lag issue appears when you write a record and then try to read the
same record from a slave before it has caught up. We don't handle the
case of old data being read in subsequent page loads but when it
happens in the same page load it can cause very nasty problems. We
handled this in HyperDB by staying on the write connection after any
write, in the same page load. In other words, never use a read-only
connection after having used a master connection. It's not perfect but
you can't imagine how many problems this caused in the early days of
WordPress.com.

If I think of anything else WPDB needs for slave awareness I'll let
you know. I have a sneaking feeling that I'm forgetting something
important.

Agreed. You can help the process along by filing a trac ticket
requesting this enhancement.

Somebody may eventually code it for you but I like to encourage those
of willing spirit to learn to hack and upload patches.

That's exactly why it was posted, to get Feedback :)

Replication lag is something that I'm planning on adding in (either 
through your method or by checking SHOW SLAVE STATUS output) - we're 
still internally checking it's not doing anything weird with the 
Read/Write connections first though.

I'll add extra slave support in to it when I'm back in the office.

The same could be said of a lot of the code though... I try to keep to 
the coding standards at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards but lots of bits 
of the code seems to be differing from the standards documented at the 
previous URL.

Could you point out specific instances in the patch that doesn't correspond?

Any other comments so I can look at them tomorrow?

Colin

WordPress looks in TEMPLATEPATH for template files, including standard
files (e.g. single.php, home.php) and page templates (e.g. link.php or
any php file with a Template Name).

OP wants it to look in STYLESHEETPATH first. That way, if you
distribute a theme that depends on another theme's templates you can
include overriding and additional templates.

For example, you can distribute a theme consisting of nothing but a
stylesheet and use the Template directive (in the stylesheet comment)
to have it rely on the php templates in the Sandbox theme. What you
can't do is include php templates and have them supercede the Sandbox
templates. Instead you must include the desired Sandbox php templates
and not use the Template directive.

I don't understand. As of now there are loads of things that have to
be translated directly in the PHP-files since those parts can't be
handled by gettext (po). How would those parts of the translation work
be taken care of in the proposed plan?

Just a few quick thoughts:
wp-includes/strings.php
  * Contains any hard coded strings in english, Ie. strings for before  
gettext is loaded.
wp-load.php:
  * Checks to see if wp-content/strings.php exists
    * If so Include that file
    * Else, include the default wp-includes/strings.php file

wp-load/wp-settings/etc for before gettext loaded:
  * Reference to $hardcoded['no_db'], or $hardcoded['php_too_old'] rather  
than hard coded strings.

Result:
  * Core files not modified, Localised distributions have to include a  
single extra file in the distro in the users content folder
  * Static files would notbenefit from that, but, i would hope that  
instead, translated versions were included, ie. readme.html = english,  
readme-fr.html = french translation

Once again, Thats just quick thoughts, I dont know if any would actually  
be implementable or not..
I guess i shouldn't comment when it comes to internationalised versions  
given i'm not 100% sure how they work..

I was about to propose something similar. You could do checks for the 
hard coded string first and if it doesn't exist do whatever is done now. 
It would remove the need for a strings.php in the wp-includes directory. 
I do believe having a strings.php in the wp-includes directory would 
help translators with the possible strings that they can translate 
instead of having to look through the code, even if there is a Codex 
page on the topic.

Hello all,
I'm about ready to release an update[1] of my WP-Crontrol[2] plugin, but I
wanted to mention it first to the wp-hackers crowd in search of
feedback/bugs.  The people on this mailing list are the target audience
anyway, I believe.

New in this version is:
* Input of PHP code for cron entries
* Non-repeating cron entries
* Cron entries with arguments

All comments are welcome.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <28406b400806041519j43d9569dx3c28b0f121c1a186@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I'm the developer for a plugin (wp-recaptcha) and it has been my
intention (Due to many requests) to make it MU-capable, the only 'problem'
is I haven't gotten around to figuring out what it is that this entails.

Does MU use actions and filters? The main filters I use are:

wp_head - CSS for the reCAPTCHA related things on the blog such as hidden
emails (filter)
admin_head - CSS for the admin settings (filter)
login_head - CSS for the reCAPTCHA on the registration page (filter)
register_form - To display the reCAPTCHA on the registration page (action)
registration_errors - In case the user typed in the wrong CAPTCHA or failed
the test, display the errors (filter)
the_content - Email hiding using MailHide (filter)
get_comment_text - Email hiding for comments (filter)
the_content_rss - Email hiding for the content in RSS (filter)
comment_text_rss - Email hiding for comments in RSS (filter)
comment_form - To display the reCAPTCHA form (action)
pre_comment_approved - To mark comments as spam (action)
preprocess_comment - To check the comment before we post it (filter)
comment_post_redirect - To redirect if the user failed the CAPTCHA (filter)
admin_menu - For the plugin options (action)
admin_footer - For plugin warnings (action)

Or is it even a matter of what hooks aren't available but something else? Or
maybe they are different hooks that I must hook to? I'll gladly figure this
out myself I just don't know where to start, thanks I would appreciate any
help.

I don't wish to start a discussion on here about this topic, but I
thought some people on the list may be interested in this post, and
the ensuing comments, about people who charge outrageous prices to
install WordPress (eg. ?550/$850/?430) :
<http://www.mulley.net/2008/06/04/wanted-people-to-install-wordpress-without-robbing-others-blind/>
. The comments cover most angles of all the arguments. Obviously there
is a need and a market for people who install and configure WordPress
for those who cannot do it themselves, but, as with a lot of things,
it's a shame that there are people out there who are so willing to
take advantage of these people by charging unfair prices.

Hi all,
I apologize in advance if this has been covered before, or somewhere else.

I believe I'm missing something very simple here, because I can't seem 
to make the rewrite_rules_array filter do... well anything.
I've even tried just throwing a "die" in the function that the filter 
points too... nothing. It's not the add_filter call, because if I set it 
to any other filter, it works fine.

I'll probably have a embarrassing, forehead slap moment briefly after 
sending this email, but in the mean time: Any suggestions?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Seeking feedback on Plugins UI
Message-ID: <op.ub9fxwi7k6w4mc@dd32.no-ip.com>

There are 2 major UI's which i'd like to get some general feedback on:
  * Plugin Management - Delete/Group activation/deactivate
  * Plugin Installation list

The first one went into trunk last night:  
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7091
There's an online demo here:  
http://dd32.id.au/files/wordpress/plugin-delete-stuff/manage-plugins.html  
(Just a save as of the plugins page)
Nothing is active in that demo, but it shows the general layout.

Notes:
  * Deactivate all / Reactivate all have been removed, They are replaced by  
the Bulk selection and Recently Active plugins list
  * The plugin list is seperated into 3 groups:
    * Active plugins: Plugins which are currently active on the blog
    * Recently Active plugins: Plugins which have been deactivated in the  
last 7 days
    * Available plugins: Plugins which are installed, But are not active.
  * Plugins can only be deleted if they are deactivated.

Thoughts? Anything missing? Anything needs adding?

Todo:
  * Better wording
  * Confirmation before deleteing plugins
  * Cleanup of the back-code.



Next, As part of Google Summer of Code this year, I'm writing in a Plugin  
installer; I'm seeking feedback on the basic UI.
Trac: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6015 (Ignore any attachments there,  
Its not current code/UI)
Demo's:
  * Plugin Search page:  
http://dd32.id.au/files/wordpress/plugin-install-ui/install-plugins-search.html
     * Needs Fleshing out a bit, Probably allow uploading of a plugin  
archive too
  * Plugins Listing page:  
http://dd32.id.au/files/wordpress/plugin-install-ui/install-plugins.html
     * Anything missing?
     * Anything needs to be there?

I have not got the next install ui up yet, However:
  * Clicking Install will most likely bring up a thickbox page with fuller  
details about the plugin, Much like the WordPress.org site, Once the users  
had a chance to look at the full details, They can confirm installation.

Thoughts on the Layouts?

Anything missing? A detail you'd like to see in the table? (ie. Recently  
updated, Or maybe the total number of ratings which have gone into that  
rating)

(Oh and Yes; Hopefully the installer will make it into 2.6, So i better  
get cracking :))

The filter would only be fired when the rules are regenerated.

You have to trigger flush_rules. Changing your permalink structure or
saving a page will do it.

Knew i forgot something:
While the Delete function has been tested and worked on my local setup,  
And is the same routines as used by the plugin upgrader:

Please make sure you've backed up any changes or unpublished plugins  
before attempting to use it, It'd be bad to hear someone loose work  
because of a bug.

Actually, I did a bunch of experimentation with caching and different
browsers a few months ago.  Most browsers will not cache files if the
server doesn't properly set the Etags and/or Cache-Control directives.
 Most vanilla versions of apache do not do this.  This results in a
real request for the files on each page reload.

There's a firefox plugin that let's you view the headers, and on most
web sites I tested with WordPress, pretty much everything was reloaded
while bouncing between pages (since there was no caching information
in the response).

You can manually get around this by adding caching instructions to
your .htaccess file for Apache, which is what I believe Google said
they were going to do for these libraries.  For example, here's a head
request for the prototype library from Google:
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/prototype/1.6.0.2/prototype.js

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Last-Modified: Sat, 24 May 2008 00:39:29 GMT
Content-Type: application/x-javascript
Expires: Fri, 05 Jun 2009 06:20:49 GMT
Date: Thu, 05 Jun 2008 06:20:49 GMT
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
Content-Length: 126127
Server: GFE/1.3

Notice the cache-control and expires directives which tells browsers
to cache it and for how long.

I think it's actually a neat idea, but I'd much rather the files be
hosted on WordPress somewhere if possible.   And in fact, if WordPress
hosted minified versions and encouraged theme/plugin developers to use
those, it could very well result in a large performance increase
across all WordPress sites that use these libraries in the future,
since the caching benefits would be shared between sites.

Oh, good thinking, thanks. I'll test on a different install than my

I do it all on my local dev machine with a single install, So i've got a  
lot to loose, I figure, I'm going to proect my own code..
Theres been a few times i've managed to royally screw myself. Just the  
other day apache went loose deleteing my documents/settings/emails, And  
then PHP overwrote them with trace logs, so recovery programs couldnt work  
either :)

At first look there is nothing missed ad i like this new management a
lot!

A look like the one for PressThis screen, with tabs with same info you
have on plugin repository, like description, installation, FAQ, i
would miss the screenshot that is not so usefull. This info will be
catched on demand using ajax

Would be nice having the version of WP for the plugin works, unless
the list it's already filtered

Much the same as the Media uploader, So a similar format to Press This  
too, just not in its own window :)

Caching the information clientside while flipping through the  
Description/FAQ/Installation tabs would be done of course.

Ajax would probably not be needed at all, Just Load the page in an iframe  
in thickbox(like the media uploader) The delay in WordPress querying  
wordpress.org's plugin database should be minimal for most webhosts  
(Fetching external data is generally pretty quick)

Ah yes, Compatibility.

The list could be filtered server side to not show plugins which require a  
later version of WordPress, However, I think this might work instead:

Displaying the "Requires" & "Tested up to" field is something that would  
be on the detailed view, But also would be good on the plugins list,  
Perhaps differing background colours (As well as a value shown somewhere)
Green: Known to be compatible
Yellow: Has not been tested with the current version of wordpress
White: Unknown tested up to version
Red: Plugin requires a later version of WordPress

The benefit of this (rather than filtering out incomparible plugins) would  
be to allow users to know that there *is* a plugin which will fill the use  
they want, However, to use it, they'll need a later version of WordPress.  
(Installation would also not be offered if the plugin requires a later  
edition)

Maybe another colour for "Has been tested to work with this branch"(eg.  
Running 2.6.1, plugin has been tested up to 2.6.0, It should not give the  
same warning as if it was only tested up to 2.3 or 2.5)

Or even a column "Compatible": "Yes", "Maybe: Tested to 2.5.2", "Unknown",  
"Requires WordPress 2.7"

Just quick thoughts there on the colours.

Like the idea of colours, I dont' like the idea to have full
background couloured, even if some plugins shoudl show up a nice
combination of grren/white/red that's tha italian flag :)

Text would be more clear, with coulors only you will need a map to
explain the use of colour, what about a ribbon with thext inside, the
ribbon is coloured in the way u said above, with an extra explanatory
text inside? The colors suggested for various status it's ok for me.

My original thought for colours was trying to limit the ammount of text  
which is in the table,
The table width is rather slim, and adding extra columns really does  
decrease whats available for the description.
(That, and a column reading "Required WordPress 2.7" takes up 2-3 rows  
generally.. Possibly not a real issue other than in my mind :P)

I'll have a play and see what i can come up with.

Hi,

The main difference between WP and MU for plugins is where the plugin 
lives. There is a plugins folder still, but there's also an mu-plugins 
folder too. Any file in mu-plugins will be included/loaded on every 
request. It's likely that your plugin will be dropped in there.

Also, almost every user on an MU site is untrusted, even admins. The 
only people who should have access to edit css or html in your plugin 
are site admins. You can check if the current user is one by using the 
is_site_admin() function, any time after init.

My thoughts:

I don't see much improvement in the Plugins page. The bulk selection stuff 
is cool, but I'm definitely not fan of the "let's split the plugin list in 
3 parts" move: yet another area in the admin where I will be scrolling 
back and forth like crazy to find what I'm looking for (especially between 
the "not active" and the "recently active" lists)
What I find more efficient and would like best would be a single list with 
filtering capabilities:
<http://planetozh.com/download/plugins/better-plugin-page-demo/>

Note about the wording: "available plugins" might be confusing here. A 
plugin can be available "on my blog" or available "for download from 
wp.org", so I recommend the good old "inactive". "Available" makes more 
sense on the page where you browse and pick a plugin to install.

The other pages under the "Install Plugins" page are definitely cool and 
bring true features.

I'm not sure we need a "recently updated" list: either we get notification 
updates for plugin we have installed, or we find a cool plugin by browsing 
through popular or by searching, right? "Newest" can be a cool page to get 
some inspiration ("hey, nice plugin idea, I'm going to try this") but I 
can't imagine why I would ever look at the "recently updated" list.

More infos in the "Install Plugins" pages would be cool: average rating, 
sure, but how about the number of ratings, the number of downloads, and 
infos about version compatibility (a lot of plugins are mentioning they're 
compatible up to 2.3)

I think there's an inconsistency between the main plugin page and the 
Install Plugins / Popular Plugin page: plugins URL are either the real 
plugin page or the page on wp.org/extend, plugin authors are either linked 
to their own websites or to their wp.org profile. I think I like first 
option best (real page, website).

Wording: "term" is unclear to me on the search page. Does it mean "search 
from title / description" ? I wouldn"t have thought about searching by 
authors but this is very cool.

A cool feature to consider would be a way to rate a plugin right from my 
own Plugin Management page. That would increase connectivity between blog 
users and wp.org/extend and make those ratings more relevant with more 
votes.

All in all, very impressive work again DD. Definitely something I'm 
looking forward to using in next WP.

I know it depends on api.wordpress.org n' whatnot, but I think  there
/has/ to be some indicator, per-plugin, as to whether it's available
from WP Extend or whether it's using something else.  The current
situation is confusing and leads folks to think that EVERYTHING is
being checked for updates, which unfortunately isn't true.

So, I dunno if there's a way to integrate that information into your
current layouts, DD32 and Ozh, but visual cueing on the subject would
be most helpful.

++1 it's quite a necessary function cause with this new function less
people will go to plugin repository and for sure fewer will go after
installing a plugin just to rating it.

Theres a ticket for that: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5117
I'm not sure of what/how to go about it on that one, I've been steering  
clear of that as no thoughts of what to do have come to mind.
If someone came up with a UI mockup, Then i'd have a go at implementing it  
if they could not do it themselves.

I guess it comes down to the user really.
A few people who i've talked to about it rarely goto the plugin interface,  
When they do, they're generally after deactivating an active plugin, or  
activating a plugin.
Or its to upgrade a plugin, In general, They're only interested in the  
Active plugins.

My thinking was "Here are the plugins you have installed which are  
Available for use"
However, I do see what you mean.
It didnt make much sense to me at the time for "Here are the plugins which  
you have installed, but are not activated" "Deactivated Plugins" just  
didnt fit in as a title to me.

I'm open to All ideas, I wasnt expecting it to be commited so soon to be  
honest, i was expecting to end up making some changes to the patch  
beforehand based off some feedback :)

I just grabbed the current views the wordpress.org site referenced to.
That list is filterable, So a plugin could come along and add a tab;
Eg: Cool-site.com hosts some wordpress blogs, it installs a plugin and  
adds another tab "Premium Plugins", They'd be plugins that the user has  
access to from that host..

Yep, Compatibility needs to be mentioned, Still unsure how to show that
Total downloads... Thats not really a statistic which needs to be  
expressed in the downloads list IMO, I'm not interested in a plugin being  
downloaded 1000 times ot 5 times, What i want is something that is rated  
well, and completes the needed task.
I am open to ideas though :)

Ah.. The main reason its linking weirdly there is because that mockup was  
pulling data from the RSS feed, as such, most of the data had to be bodged  
:)
The plugin name should link to the plugins homepage, The author link  
should link to the authors homepage, same as the plugins page.
Might need to add a link to the wordpress.org page in there now you  
mention it.

I took the inspiration from the Last.Fm player, It allows searching by  
Artist or Tag, It seemed like a good idea.
I wasnt sure of what to call the "Term" one, But it'd basically search the  
title and description.. You've searching for a term in the plugins  
directory, or a tag, or a plugins author.
The search page needs some work though.

That is a good point, I'll have a think about it. It does increase the  
conection between the 2 significantly..
There's possibly going to be a few changes to change that in the future  
too, So i think i might leave that thought until later, and just get the  
core installation working first before looking at the integration issues.

I agree... and i got an idea, actually in the dashboard show up a
message that inform about new WP version available, woudl be nice
having a message that inform about avability of new updates for one or
more plugin, not a list of updatted plugin but somethign that inform
there is updates available.. a rd icon with an exclamation mark
besides the plugin menu entry would nice too... sometimes i forget for
a couple of weeks to check plugins pages of one of my blog and this
would be a nice remind. The exclamation icons beside the plugin menu
would be better than a message in dashboarda cause ti woudl be visible
in every admin page.

>It didnt make much sense to me at the time for "Here are the plugins which  
>you have installed, but are not activated" "Deactivated Plugins" just  
>didnt fit in as a title to me.

"Unactive Plugins" sound better? I will change the "Currently Active
Plugins" in a more simple "Active Plugins" too

Well, of course, wordpress.com does already have those files...

http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js
http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/prototype.js

And so on. So the same plugin given before could be made to pull from
there, if you really wanted. Also, if you check those, I think the
headers are good for caching properly as well.

Are they charging just for a default install, or for an install and
some support? Because those prices don't seem all that unreasonable to
me to hire somebody for custom work.

Now, yes, if it's just to install it and then to go away, then that is
ridiculous, but quite frankly anybody who cannot work out how to
install WordPress by themselves probably will need to hire somebody to
do support work for them at some point in the future.

It is definitely no a neat idea, if people don't know what we are doing.

Hosting at Google is a poor choice, hosting at workpress.com, seems
better but we still need to tell user the potential issues, e.g. their
visitor information might be logged at wordpress.com - the problem of
privacy which has been discussed before.

It's a great choice for many reasons, the most basic being that in this case
Google is acting as a free CDN for the library, and as a CDN Google blows
away any other option in terms of reliability, speed and capacity.

In case you're using Google Analytics, then you're already letting Google
host JS for your pages.  This is conceptually no different.

I don't want WP as a opensource project, to be particularly favoring
one vendor, no matter Google, Yahoo or blah.. Just my $0.02.

I don't think people who have their web server mind serving a little
bit more JS.

The point is you have choice, you know what you are doing, rather than
we do them anonymously.

The files may not be, but the transport certainly is. When I pull up
http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js , and check the
headers, it shows Content-Encoding: gzip in them.

Oh really? I took a look at the Prototype file, and it is not getting 
compressed at all.

I aggree with OZH that three sections to display the plugins in your
plugin folder is too much. Also, if most people are there to activate
or deactivate, then the hardest thing to get to (a
never-been-activated plugin) is tied for most likely to be used.

I'm not sure about the statistics about how many plugins most users
have installed, but I think that the demos that DD32 and OZH posted
are examples of extreme edge cases where the person not only has tons
of active plugins, but is also hoarding inactive ones for some reason.
If users can delete plugins and install them from inside the admin,
there's really no need to help them sort a giant mess, they should
clean it up instead. It also seems unnecessarily complicated for new
users with very few plugins. We all have tons, but a new user might
install one plugin, go to that page and see what: two confusing empty
sections and their new plugin hiding at the bottom. Until you have
more than 10 plugins it is totally fine to have them all together in
one list with color defining active/inactive status.

I think going back to a single list is a good idea. The checkboxes are
a SUPER useful upgrade to the screen and will make the difference
we're looking for for batch maintenance. If the 'recently deactivated'
information is really useful (i'm pretty skeptical about that but if
everyone else thinks its a good idea) then we should have a column in
the table that shows 'status' including how long ago an inactive
plugin was deactivated, or a special icon or something that defines it
as 'recently deactivated'.

The section appears and disappears when necessary, if u go tafter
first install to plugin page u see only last section

Would be nice too, but i would like this list be sorted by the status
anyway...

The recently disactivated is necessary cause with this new interface
you don't have reactivate plugin button anymore (if i'm not wrong) but
you can activate a bunch of plugins using checkboxes, so having the
recente disactivated plugin grouped in a list would help to reactivate
plugin after the canonical disactivation required for a correct WP
upgrade

Thanks! I looked at your Super Cache plugin which is MU friendly supposedly
and I saw this line in the readme.txt:

If you are using WordPress MU you will need to install this in
'wp-content/mu-plugins/wp-super-cache/' and the file wp-cache.php must be
copied into the mu-plugins directory.

Must I do something like this too then? Also in the mu-plugins directory one
cannot put plugin folders like say the entire wp-recaptcha folder? Only PHP
scripts? In that case if I have more files like stylesheets and libraries
then I will need to do what you said in the above line right? Ah I finally
found what I was looking for:

add_submenu_page('wpmu-admin.php', __('WP Super Cache'), __('WP Super
Cache'), 'manage_options', __FILE__, 'wp_cache_manager');
add_options_page('WP Super Cache', 'WP Super Cache', 'manage_options',
__FILE__, 'wp_cache_manager');

That allows me to place the options page under the so called admin settings
or whatever, which was what someone was telling me about, I assume. I guess
is_site_admin is a WPMU only check then.

Thanks for any help you can provide Donncha!

Ok, thanks again for the help :)

There is one other thing I don't really understand...
Could you explain the precedence of the rewrite rules? I would image 
that they would be ascending, so rules added last are checked first, but 
that doesn't seem to be the case.

For example, while running your test plugin, it doesn't catch any of the 
artist rules, it just assigns "artist" to the pagename query var.

So, what I am doing wrong? Is the permalink structure in the Settings 
page overriding the rewrite rules? Because that's what it seems like.

Thanks in advance!

They are processed by a foreach in WP::parse_request()
(wp-includes/classes.php).

Ahh, perfect.

So, if I need rule to be matched first, I'll need to array_unshift() it 
onto the rules array, instead of appending it.

Thanks!

Well, you don't even need the function call.
But, it's definitely good to know that they are processed in a 
descending order.

I've updated the source and I think I'm almost done getting it working, if
anyone would be so kind as to get the HEAD revision of
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-recaptcha/trunk/ and test it I would really
appreciate it.

Instead of background colors, which have at least one drawback -- 
accessibility (colorblindness, other limited vision conditions depending 
on the colors used and level of contrast), I think that simple icons 
accompanied by a short text label would probably be more efficient.

For a "Compatible?" column, a few simple icons could be used: (1) a  
green check-mark if the plugin is compatible with the user's current 
version; (2) The WordPress Circle "W" logo with an arrow pointing up if 
the user would have to upgrade to the current version of WordPress; (3) 
A "prohibited" icon (a circle with a slash through it) if the plugin is 
not compatible with the user's current version and no newer version 
exists; and (4) a question mark if compatibility has not been checked.

* * *

I was wondering if there's any traction for modifying the existing 
Plugin Management table by hiding the options for each plugin via 
JavaScript -- similar to how the "Write Page" part of the Administration 
Panel has collapsed boxes under the "Advanced Options" heading.

This enhanced UI would be equally appropriate for what DD32 is currently 
working on: integrated plugin installation. Applying this enhancement to 
his plugin search results pages, just the basic information can be 
listed on the first line/row: name, version, author(s), what the plugin 
does, and compatibility. The second "row" can contain a longer 
description, any important notes, extra links, etc.

All in all, I think that this would be a solid UI enhancement, which 
increases the usability and simplicity of the Plugin Management table as 
well as the new integrated search results page(s) for plugins.  If there 
is traction,  then I'd be fine with digging into the code and doing as 
much of the groundwork as I could for DD32 or whoever the lead person 
for this improvement would be.

Oh.. Damn, I havnt updated the plugin example since WordPRess 2.5 was  
releasd, The final queries are greedy and match everything.. Need to add  
them either at the start, or just before the Page queries.

As for precidence, Its whatever is first in the array that matches, Look  
at the rewrite_rules option: print_r(get_option('rewrite_rules')); and  
you'll see the order in which they match

2.8.3 now fully supports WordPress MU. Make sure you follow the
instructions. It is available here [
http://wpmudev.org/project/WP-reCAPTCHA], but I PREFER that you
download it from here
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-recaptcha/ where you can also find
installation instructions.

I was thinking of changing the Actions column to say:

"Compatible; Install"
"Tested with 2.5; Install"
"Requires WordPress 2.9"

Maybe with some icons too.

There was a Icon in the 2.5 Status column for a day or 2, But IIRC Matt  
removed it (As well as the issue it wasnt under an licence that was  
compatible).
I do think a icon would be nice, But So far i've not seen *any* icon sets  
which i think work in the WordPress admin.. (And convey the meaning  
without me having to hover for a title)

That does sound useable, My only thought is what about those that do not  
have Javascript enabled? Are the rows allways visible? If thats the case,  
Then it'd cause a jumping effect as the JS hides the extra rows on  
pageload.

But it would also allow more links relating to the plugin

I think a combination could work:
Current layout for Static items
Hover over the row for a few ms, and a extra box pops up(fades in?) that  
allows you to view the rating, the downloads, extra links, etc.
Maybe? But i'm also thinking that might be too much.. Or it might not be  
as useable as having to hover over stuff all the time gets anoying

I personally like the 3 tables, However now see that There are some people  
who would have a hard time with it.
One of the reasons i split it was to allow for the bulk managing, You dont  
Activate an allready active plugin, And you dont want to Delete an Active  
plugin.

I'd suspect that the default CSS state for the second row would be set 
at "display: none;" so there shouldn't be any extreme jumping effect.

Though, checking how WP displays certain Admin Panel pages when JS is 
disabled revealed the following:
(1) On the "Write Post" page, the "Advanced Options" boxes are expanded 
and the disclosure triangle is hidden.
(2) On the Widgets page, after a Widget is added to a sidebar, it's box 
is still collapsed, though the box does appear expanded for a few 
milliseconds before collapsing. To edit the settings for a widget, the 
user needs to click on the "Edit" link, which seems to be processed 
server-side via PHP rather than client-side with JS.

Before the paragraph that was quoted, I mentioned "I think that simple 
icons accompanied by a short text label would probably be more 
efficient." I can't find any definitive UI discussions at the moment, 
but icons alone for a new UI are generally to be avoided unless they 
follow conventions that make them instantly understandable. That's why 
text+icon would be a better choice. And, I find that processing the 
meaning of a familiar icon is faster than processing text. Plus, the 
current choice of background colors for the Plugins Management table 
doesn't seem that helpful.

As far as icons goes, those can be done from scratch.

I do think that regardless of what changes are integrated,  one table is 
best. Just make sure that the new interface is flexible enough to allow 
for exceptions: If a user selects an active plugin among the plugins 
that he or she wants to activate, then when the activations are 
processed, just skip that one. If a user selects an active plugin to 
delete, then on the confirmation screen you're working on, add a notice 
that "The Following Plugins are Currently Active. Please deactivate them 
before deleting." But still allow the user to go ahead and delete 
plugins that are inactive.  And, maybe allowing an over-ride checkmark 
on that screen, something like: "Yes, I really want to delete these 
active plugins."

Whether one table is used or not, I think that instead of just putting 
"Selected plugins *activated*" (or "...deleted," or "deactivated," etc.) 
as a notice box, that box should list the names of the plugins. If we do 
go with one table, then, to replace the recently activated table,  then 
the plugins that would go into that table could have a little star icon 
beside their name. Though, if under the status table, if there could be 
some sort of "uptime" notice: x minutes, x hours, x days, etc, that 
would be helpful for troubleshooting.

When reading the post I found it is plain standard install...
This is ridiculous.

Whenever there is more behind it (telling people how to use it, custom
theming, searching and installing plugins, whatever) a price starting from
500? would be OK in my eyes. Just remember the normal costs for seminars...

Since I can not imagine some individual will pay 500 ? and above for a blog
I think this are bussiness prices and I never had any bussiness partners
which didn't wanted to have someone they could call when they are in
trouble. They belive this is self-evident. If it is or isn't doesn't matter
- if you want a good reputation. So you will start to say it is self-evident
and calculate you prices alike. Then you say: Installing WordPress with a
freely available theme and putting your company logo into them plus short
tutorial on how to use wp starts at 500 Euro since I will have to answer
them some questions later anyway. (I wouldn't even start writing a bill for
answering a questing which maybe took me 15 minutes. But 15 minutes are
worth some money anyway and so you will have to put them into the first
bill...

That's the silliest thing I've ever heard.

Maybe, but that's no reason not to use replication.

I've not been impressed with master-slave replication in MySQL, so go  
for master-master if you have the chance. Evaluate the pros and cons  
though, sometimes master with lots of slaves is ideal, but master- 
master has more advantages in my situation.

Something to chew on:

Except google is not a CDN - since I very much doubt they are doing  
any geo targeting of the user to the server that serves it. Its just  
more expected that users will have gone to a google service, or some  
site using this service, and would already have it cached. This does  
not a CDN make.

I wouldn't say that at all. Never underestimate your value - not your  
worth - your value. And never be ashamed of making money. If the  
customer values the service enough to pay that price, who are you to  
say its a rip off.

I can make up to $300 / hr consulting. Often times, wordpress is  
involved. Obviously I'm doing more than just installing wordpress, but  
that's not really how the world works anyway.

perception is almost everything. results are the rest.

I agree with that.

Most on this list can install WordPress in a matter of minutes.

Most mechanics can change an oil filter in a matter of minutes, Does that  
mean they shouldn't charge you for their knowledge and know-how?

Specialising in something and knowing how to do it well and right gives  
you the ability to charge for it :)

If someone wants to pay $1000 then so be it, If they ask around and find  
someone who'll do it for $200, Then as a consumer they've looked around  
for what they're willing to pay.

If i payed $1000, I would personally expect other services to come with  
it, But thats not everyone.
I had someone come to me a few weeks ago after paying $500 for a wordpress  
blog and theme from a company, The theme didnt even work properly, There  
were extra html tags scattered through it which made it look horrible as  
soon as you posted content. Instead of going back to them and paying the  
$200/h consulting rate, He asked me and for a much smaller ammount i  
cleaned up his theme, I could've done the same and charged a higher  
ammount, But i felt charitable, and got him off cheaply after spending so  
much for a broken product.

People need to make a living :)

Message-ID: <EEE3C345-FF83-4DB2-99E6-19C8422B7F9D@striderweb.com>

Hi all --

Is there a way to automatically get a plugin page link, e.g. "options- 
general.php?page=myplugin.php"?

I'm adding a "Settings" link in the Plugins page.  At the moment I'm  
hard-coding it; I would prefer some sort of reusable code that figures  
the link out itself.

Setting $page = add_submenu_page... returns (in this case)  
'design_page_pull-quotes' which isn't going to work.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Stephen

Google is not a charity, the most important thing is

you-should-let-user-know-google-is-monitoring-your-visitor-if-you-host-js-at-google-and-it-should-be-disabled-by-default

That' all.

Use a stub rather than your plugin's path/filename and then just hardcode
it.

add_options_page( 'My Plugin', 'My Plugin', 'manage_options',
'your-plugin-stub', 'myfunction' );

Firefox is an opensource project and greatly favours Google, thats what he

Working on client Intranet type blog. The bloggers will be upper  
management folks and the readers the general employees. They want to  
associate a photo with each post. So far nothing major, use WP 2.5.1  
and the built-in Gravatar support. Not quite. The site will be  
internal ( as in behind a firewall). They want to manage the users and  
photos internal.

I noticed on the WordPress.com sites under the author edit there is a  
nice 'My Picture' box. Is that code publicly available??

Outside of that I'm looking for a plugin (or someone's hack) to manage  
an author photo. Sure, I can write my own but why do that when I can  
use other's work.

Anyone have a suggestion?

get_avatar() is pluggable if you want to hack together an alternate to

Thanks Aaron. Was really wanting to avoid hacking code. My thought is  
someone somewhere out there has already put together a plugin to allow  
author photo management. And I just found a plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-photo/

Are you kidding me? Google has farms of servers setup all over the
place. They do a *lot* of traffic, you know. I would not be surprised
if they did some kind of shortest path targetting for pretty much all
their hits.

No sir, I am not. They go where the power is, not where the Users or  
the fiber is. As this is the one cost they have a hard time  
controlling. And I'd be very surprised if they are geo targeting users  
for this ajax api thing. Again, I would not call them a CDN. Same way  
I would not call S3 a CDN.

You can edit the theme to do something like:

echo '<img src="' . $author . '_pic.jpg">

No hacks, just a small addition to the theme.

To expand on that:

<img src="<?php echo get_bloginfo('wpurl') .
'/wp-content/authorimages/author_' . $post->post_author . '.jpg'; ?>"
alt="<?php the_author(); ?>" />

Then just name your images "author_1.jpg", etc. with the number being their
userid.

I found another plugin already made to do this sort of thing:
http://blog.clearskys.net/2008/05/28/google-ajax-libraries-api-plugin/

There was also some discussion about this on Dion Almaer's blog:

I have been looking and working on a plugin that will give you a collapsible
widget. I want to add content but be able to set a flag on whether it
starts hidden or open.
Any ideas ...I have seen some that kind of work if you have only one
sidebar, but in this day and age I have a WordPress 2.5.1 with multiple
"sidebars"...perhaps it is time to change the sidebar to dynamic Area?  Let
sidebar go the way of the blogroll.

Thank you,
Scott

I kind of like the idea of separating the plugins into multiple lists, 
but I think three is excessive.  What's wrong with just an "active" and 
"inactive" list?  Once you give the user an easy way to delete and 
install plugins, I don't think there will be a ton of plugins that 
aren't used, so that third list will only hold "recently added and 
not-yet-activated" plugins, which probably shouldn't be on the bottom 
since the user is probably planning on activating them.

I agree with OZH, I'd use "active" and "inactive" and then use 
"available" for plugins that are available to be installed.

I think that "recently updated" shows that a plugin is under active 
development, and hasn't been abandoned.  However, it's not perfect 
because often plugins have a longer release cycle than what wp.org 
considers "recent" ...So I understand its purpose, but I'm not sure it 
quite accomplishes it.

I think that total number of votes and total number of downloads are 
both important.  Total number of votes because a plugin rated 5 stars 
with only one vote (probably the plugin author's) shouldn't look the 
same as a plugin with 5 stars and 100+ votes.

As for the total number of downloads, I think this gives similar 
information on the viability of the plugin.  People don't often come 
back to the plugin page and vote for a plugin that works.  However, if 
the plugin causes them problems, they come back and vote it down.  So, 
if a plugin has a couple thousand downloads, only 5 votes, and a 3.5 
star rating, I can probably assume there are a lot of people out there 
that like it, would rate it in the 4-5 star range, and just didn't vote.

Which leads me to the next point:

What is changing that would keep this from being accomplished?  As a 
plugin author, I'm continually frustrated by the lack of feedback from 
users.  I have one plugin with 1800+ downloads and 5 ratings, another 
with 2300+ downloads and 4 ratings, and yet another with 6300+ downloads 
and only 5 ratings.

I think the 3 lists are necessary cause new design miss the reactivate
plugins button that reactivate only th plugin reviously disactivated
with one click button (deactivate all plugin.

Now you can clcik the table header checkbox to deactivate all the
active plugin in these will appera in the only second list mixed with
never activated plugin you can't revert the situation back easily.

The deactivate/reactivate buttons for a group of plugin was a hig
requested features for years, the new design shoudl mantain this in
some way, and sin checkboxes for group operation need to have 3 lists

I agree with you even if not a plugin developper, giving the feedback
info to user and allow them to vote inside wp admin interface will
encourage people to vote, an action that maybe they actually don't do
after installed a plugin cause they need to go back to the site nd
vote.

I've got a plugin [1] that does sidebar widget collapsing and stores
the state for what is collapsed / expanded in a cookie. It works with
multiple sidebars. You're welcome to use whatever you can take from
that if it helps you out.

Yeah, that's basically what I'm doing.  I've been trying to make my  
code as re-usable as possible across different plugins, so I was  
hoping for something a bit more flexible.

(The Settings Page form will be different every time of course, so  
that's not a big deal, but I'm also writing code to add the Settings  
link directly to the Manage Plugins actions.)

Actually, even as I wrote that I think I've figured out what to do.  I  
anticipate a Trac ticket that does something handy. ;)

Thanks Jared,
I have already tried yours and it is very close. but it only works with 1
sidebar, where I will have many. I am looking for almost a TEXT widget that
has the function to collapse when the header is clicked and has a flag to
set the initial state of open or closed. I have already tried yours and you
have alot more code than what I currently have running on my sight but yours
is more dynamic and that is what I need more of in my own code.
Getting there just not enough time with a Regular job!

Cool. Hopefully you can pull out whatever might work for you from mine
to help in your efforts.

For what it's worth, I'm currently using this on my blog with two
sidebars (sandbox based 3 column theme w/ left and right sidebars) and
it seems to work fine. I don't recall making any mods to my personal
copy after releasing the one I published, but it's possible that I did
and just forgot.

It's been a while since I had time to do any plugin dev / maintenance,
so I may not get around to updating it anytime soon. It sounds like
you may be looking to do something different enough to be a separate
plugin, but in case you want to "fork" off of mine I'll gladly refer
people to yours going forward.

I have a few things to say about this.  First, looking at the wireframe, 
there are two rows dedicated to one plugin.  I'd make it one row, and 
hide unnecessary data by giving the table row a "collapsed" class using 
a "hide" class on whatever you want hidden.  I've done this a lot 
before, and you can observe the onclick of the table, grab the table row 
that was clicked, and remove the "collapsed" class or put it back.  You 
combine it with CSS like this:
tr.shrunk .hide {display:none;}

The problem then is people with no Javascript right?  Well, you can use 
the same principle that I laid out in my article about  Properly 
degrading JavaScript Effects with Script.aculo.us 
<http://xavisys.com/properly-degrading-js-effects-with-scriptaculous/>. 
Basically, create an empty CSS class for what you want "tr.shrunk .hide 
{}" and then use javascript to add the display:none to the class.  This 
way, people with JavaScript get the elements hidden, and have the 
ability to expand them.  Those that don't see everything, which I would 
say is the best possible degradation.

I'm pretty sure I put it in another reply, but I still think 2 tables 
would be enough to accomplish this.  I find it a little unintuitive to 
have my inactive plugins broke into two groups, but not my active 
plugins.  However, rather than break up active plugins, I think we 
should combine the inactive ones.  Especially for bulk management, what 
if I want to active two "recently activate" plugins and two inactive 
ones?  Combining the tables would make that a lot easier.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Regarding Authors privs and comments
Message-ID: <484DCB73.8070001@gmail.com>

Just curious, is there anyway to "hide" ALL comments from authors,
except comments placed on their own posts? Currently, authors can view
ALL the comments under > Comments. For some reason, this doesn't feel
right to me. Let me give an example...

User Joe is made author, they write, they post, and so forth. That's
fine. However, IF User Joe for some reason wants to be nosy, track down
a specific user via the Comments section, they could view any and all
their contact information. Well, maybe not their Messenger usernames and
such. But, their email address, IP address and such.

Now, I know you could just make them Contributors and or Authors for a
certain time frame, then remove that status again. But, if you don't
know of a user being "stalker-ish / spy / drama feeding" from the get
go, allowing them Author status for even a short time frame, could do
more damage then not.

I guess what I'm asking / suggesting / throwing out on the table, is...

1.) Authors/ Contributors should only be able to VIEW their OWN
comments, on their own posts. And or comments held in moderation and so
forth, for their OWN posts.

2.) Administrators should ONLY be able to view ALL comments, no matter
what. Of course, this is already done. So...nothing to worry about there.

I hope this wasn't confusing...

Plugin, yeah... that would be nice at least. :D I just see it as, it 
really isn't anyone else's business but the Site Administrator's to see 
all those other comments. Those other comments, weren't even for authors 
or contributors to begin with. The only comments the authors and or 
contributors need to worry about, are their own, from their own posts.

That would kinda be like... bank workers leaving important account 
informations papers laying around, on tables, counters... then the late 
shift clean crew comes in after closing hours... and can see the same 
documents and etc... That wouldn't be good if 4 ppls accounts were 
drained the next day, just because people's documents were left out on 
tables / counters "just because"...

It uses the parent script and then adds your script's stub/filename as a
"page" variable.

Mr.Awesome,

check http://www.im-web-gefunden.de/wordpress-plugins/role-manager/ .
It might not give you exactly what you want, but it will let you hide
comments management from authors entirely, and really that sounds like
what you need, there's no reason for them to manage their own
comments, they can do so from the article pages like visitors.

Perhaps we don't understand your question? When I add, say, a page on
top of plugins.php, I do it like this:

add_submenu_page('plugins.php', __('My Plugin Configuration'), __('My
Plugin Configuration'), 'manage_options', 'my-plugin-config',
'my_plugin_conf');

The resulting URL for this is "plugins.php?page=my-plugin-config".
Both of those come from that call I just made. The plugins.php is the
first parameter, the "my-plugin-config" is the fifth. If you look at,
say, "add_options_page", then it's just doing the same call but with
"options-general.php".

The code that builds those URLs in the menu-header.php file, and it's
not a function you can call or anything, it's building it just like
that. Line 150 or thereabouts in 2.5.1.

Message-ID: <d9311c01bfac23404a4ffe1ebc583c6a@striderweb.com>

Hi all --

Per this trac ticket: <http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5117>, I am gearing
up to work on a patch that will have the Plugins admin screen indicate when
a particular plugin is _not_ automatically checked for updates.

I would like some feedback for how people think the notification should
_appear_.  Remember: these are effectively permanent, so they should be as
unobtrusive as possible.   Among the possibilities (and please suggest
others!):

1) A modified "update stripe" below the plugin row.  "<plugin name> is not
automatically checked for updates".  Make it a different color from "Update
found" notice so it's easy to distinguish.  DRAWBACKS: adds permanent
clutter

2) Add text below Version # in the version cell of the row.  "Update not
checked"

3) Add text below Description, but in the same table cell.  Formatting to
distinguish it from the description text (italic?)

4) Icons instead of text???  Add it to the "Actions" column instead??? 
Other ideas?

I know others have expressed interest in this, so let's hear it. :)

Thanks,

To me it seems like it would be more suited as a part of the status 
column.  It looks like the status column contains one of the following:
<span class="active">Active</span>
<span class="inactive">Inactive</span>

I would probably change those to a paragraph tag instead of a span, and 
add another paragraph tag with a class of "notchecked" (or something 
similar) that says "Not checking for updates" or "Does not check for 
updates" and style the notchecked class to display in italics.

Just my opinion.

"Not checked for update" is not relevant

Actually, all plugins are checked for updates, and are or are not found on 
wp.org. If they are not found, it means either that the plugin is not 
hosted on wp.org, or, and this is probably not uncommon, that the plugin 
is hosted on wp.org but locally installed in a way that prevented the API 
from matching the local install and the repository.
(Something like this: 
<http://planetozh.com/blog/2008/04/4-checkpoints-to-make-sure-plugin-update-notices-in-wordpress-will-work/>)

So, basically, the messages must be something like:
- up to date
- outdated
- unknown: could not check (and we can't be more specific at this point)

I don't care much for the additional row below the plugin row to
notify of updates anyway. It's not visually distinct enough, and it's
difficult to scan through and find.

I know this is not going to be a popular opinion, but I think we need
a new column entirely. Here's a quick mockup. Obviously, this is fast
and dirty, the widths are wrong and I picked a bright-ish color at
random. ;)

http://img76.imageshack.us/img76/498/mockupag0.png

I think that that is much simpler and easier to scan through when
looking for updates. You need to grab the users attention that an
update is available, and the second row just does not do it.

Not quite accurate, as that's actually the "Action" column.  (You'll note
that there is also already an "Edit" link there if the plugin directory can
be edited.)  This is also the place where plugin authors can put Actions
such as Uninstall, links to a Settings page, and so forth.  Not the best
place for an information field, IMO.

The messages "must" be whatever we make them.  ;-)   I think you're looking
at this from the code end of things -- we should consider it from the
User's perspective.  The distinction of whether it's not on WP Extend or
there's a problem that prevents checking is of no concern to Joe Blogger.

I'm using "Not checked for update" for the simple phrasing, in place of the
slightly more accurate "We're not automatically giving you update status,
regardless of the reason".  I'm trying to choose phrasing that suggests:

a) it's not a program fault, it's just a statement.  ("unknown" to me
suggests something went wrong)

b) there might be an update out there, but you'll have to look yourself.

c) is self-explanatory.  "Unknown" doesn't work -- it would have to be
"Update status is unknown" or somesuch -- which again, IMO, suggests a
program fault as opposed to a simple statement.

The phrasing _is_ important, so I appreciate this discussion; but it's also
easily changed later.  Right now I'm mainly looking for discussion on Where
and How to display the status within the existing interface.

Regards,

Stephen

Hopefully there will be more info on it next week.  For now I can  
tell you that the plan is to make the app open source, allowing for  
community contributions.

How about N/A (not applicable) for when it isn't or can't be checked?  
As a user, I could care less if its because its not in the plugin  
directory (which I probably already know, since I probably installed  
it) or if its because its just a problem with installation or coding  
that is causing the up-to-date to fail, so the additional detail is  
unimportant.

And I agree with otto - if we are going to basically add a third (or  
more) status type, then this should move to a column, and the row  
underneath should be replaced, or at least amended. If this is not  
possible, then the third status needs to be communicated some other  
way (if up-to-date is lack of an extra row, and out-of-date is the  
presence of the extra row). Maybe we don't collapse the two - up-to- 
date vs out-of-date with checked vs not-checked - and give this other  
status its own indicators... Maybe an icon, a different row color, or  
maybe even grouping the plugins into two groups. None of these seem  
incredibly appealing, but this may be a start.

It looks to me like the "status" and "action" columns are two separate 
columns, with the action column being the right-most column and the 
status column sitting just to the left of it.  Looking at lines 148-153 
of wp-admin/plugins.php it doesn't look like there are any hooks to add 
anything to that cell.  It will only be one of those two things.

For some reason I'm not getting my emails.  I'm actually checking  
these out on the online archive, so if I'm slow responding, that's  
why....

My bad.  I responded without looking at the page.  You are correct, of  
course Aaron.

Not sure of the idea though.   I do think that info about version  
checking should go near the version.  "Status" is sort of a  
semantically correct place to put it, though....

Possibly followed by a "Learn more" link to explain why?

Yeah, it would be nice to have a little message notifying users that they
will need to keep the certain plugin(s) up to date manually.

Where exactly on the page do you propose we put this longish sentence?

Remember that it will _always_ be visible for the applicable plugins.

I'm trying to keep the text as short as possible while still expressing the
fact that update information is not being given.  That's how I came up with
"Updates not checked".

"Not Available" doesn't do it.  _What_ isn't available?
"N/A" doesn't do it.  _What_ is not available/applicable?  (Not to mention,
other languages do not necessarily have such a compact equivalent.)
"Unknown"? Nope.

"Update information for this plugin is not available" and the like are
_great_ in terms of information and politeness, but it's way the heck too
long unless we want a permanent "modified update stripe" underneath each
and every plugin that's not on WP Extend.

I am aware that the word "checked" is not as precise as something else
might be, BUT language is a flexible thing -- you can just as easily argue
that the database didn't have any information on that plugin, and thus was
unable to check it....

>From a programmer's precise perspective, it was checked and the answer was
unavailable; but from a _user's_ perspective, that fine distinction is
meaningless.  (Can you tell I've read Alan Cooper?*   ;-p  )


I'm really leaning toward a short bit of text just below the version
number.  The "Status" column would also make sense.  I don't see too much
advantage in adding a whole new column, though ironically it might look
less cluttered if the verbiage is kep short.

I like this interface, under the Version number:

   Just the version number if it's up to date (nothing extra)
OR
   Update Available
   Download | Auto Update
OR
   Update Not Checked

Alternately, "Update Not Checked" could be a discrete icon of some sort
with a tooltip and possibly a link to a separate explanatory screen.

I was busy yesterday evening.  I'll get a mockup screenshot up tonight if I
can (after work).


One last thing -- I know there is a push to get rid of the "update stripe".
 I dislike it as well, and would love to replace it with something better.
Although that has become part of the discussion, that change will most
likely _not_ be in this patch.  I think if the patch focuses tightly on the
goal of "not found" info being returned from the server -- which only Matt
and Co. can do -- we have a better chance of getting that change made.

_Then_ we can go back and push for the changes that we can code entirely
ourselves. ;)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Theme structure
Message-ID: <330299.33696.qm@web58306.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

I'm working on building an interactive theme editor.  The idea is that the editor would enable definition of various layouts, and support styling.  The goal is to enable relative novices to design their own theme, then if they find cool stuff somewhere and put it in with a text editor, then the theme editor will still be able to work with the modified files.  Obviously, not every change can be accommodated, but I'm thinking to cover certain "normal" changes.
 
At this point, I'm just working out the concept.  

First though, I want to understand better the structure and conventions of a theme.  Obviously, WP generates HTML files using PHP, but in general people could do all kinds of wacky things in PHP.  I was wondering if there are solid standards about how a page comes together.  For example, are functions usually expected to create balanced HTML, or is it common to produce unbalanced code that must be closed off by another function?  For example, get_header() generates HTML which is incomplete without calling get_footer().    In cases like this, I could just pair off the two elements, and allow arbitrary stuff to be added between..

How much can a not-totally-stupid editor attempt to understand the structure of a document?  What are the gotchas to watch out for?

Message-ID: <006301c8cbec$507c4160$f174c420$@net>

I haven't had time to check up on this issue in a while, so I'm not sure of
the current state of:

 

1)      Is WP mysql 5.x+ compatible ? more specifically are we capable/using
the mysqli lib as opposed to the mysql lib ? at one point we needed to run
both mysql and mysqli libs because wp couldn't handle the mysqli

2)      Any further issues with WP charsets/data collations ? I've tracked a
number of issues past few years, haven't noticed anything major lately so
I'm guessing it's mostly been resolved, and there especially shouldn't be
any issues with utf8_general_ci or utf8 collation

3)      Any probs with php 5.x or associated libs ? we've got a ton of
plugins across a bunch of sites that just seem to break under more 'modern'
version of wp and anything beyond php 4.x, I've been to lazy to
re-write/correct these, so those sites haven't been updated yet, but the
time is coming.

No. WP uses the mysql library. However, this talks to MySQL 5 just fine, AFAIK.

Not in general, no, but in specific some people have issues during
upgrades if they set their collation to the wrong thing. This could be
fixed by converting their database, but in general it's simpler to
just tell them to remove the collation setting in wp-config.php.

WP itself runs fine under PHP 5, and more and more plugins are
requiring it nowadays.

PHP 4 is dead. It just has not stopped thrashing yet.

I would start by learning add_action(), add_filter, do_action(),
apply_filter() like the back of your hand.

These would be a very good way of having themes that allow users to insert
custom stuff into specific parts of the theme without actually editing the
theme files.

Good luck with this, I think it's an interesting idea. :)

Oh, you might also want to base your design off of something like the
Sandbox theme.

Not sure I really understand your idea.  You would want to allow more
"interactive" smart editing of any template?  How would people use a text
editor to "add" things without knowing html?  For some reason I am imagining
people cracking open their interactive theme editor and typing "More like
apple.com, please" and hitting update.  Most themes abide by basic
conventions but as far as div names, structures etc. there is a lot of
variation.

Stuff like left/right sidebar, single column, colors is pretty easy to
change in a specific theme.  Check out hemingway theme
http://warpspire.com/hemingway/ for an example, or this blog post about

Agreed, but they can't change the server output until a change is made
in WordPress itself. Look closely at the wp_plugin_update_row
function. If there is any sort of response from the server for a given
plugin check, it says that there's an update available. In order for
them to send back a "not found" sort of flag, WP would need to
recognize it first.

I think everyone starts thinking about building a management panel  
after a couple dozen WP themes. The concept is root in our need to  
make things as efficient as possible while providing ease of  
manageability to the user. I myself have been guilty of trying to  
build a generic theme engine based on blueprint where I can control  
the number, position and width of columns, header footer information,  
color, images and all that crap.

The problem you run into is you are needing to tweak your theme for  
each 3rd new client because they want something you didn't include or  
think of in your original theme engine design. Before you know it you  
are spending more hours tweaking your theme engine then it would have  
taken to built the simple theme from scratch in the first place. And  
because you don't want to eat the hours you try and pass these 'extra'  
hours to the clients. Pretty soon your rates are putting you out of  
the competition.

Worse than all this, you have created a beast of a theme engine that  
has to run through more queries then WP on it's best day just so the  
theme can pull together the information it need to dynamically build  
it's layout.  And this causes even more server load.

Katie mentioned some good example of theme with control panels you can  
deconstruct. I've added a few more.

Actually, I think that method only works to add them to "comment" "link" 
"page" and "post" unless you combine it with do_meta_boxes.  The $page 
parameter of add_meta_box (4th parameter) can be whatever you want, and 
then you use that same name as the $page parameter (1st parameter) of 
do_meta_boxes to actually create the boxes.

Thanks for the info, that's more or less what I thought. I have some good
information on resolving/avoiding the charset/collation probs when
installing/upgrading, I'll see if I can make some time to post it somewhere.



Thanks again../c

No. WP uses the mysql library. However, this talks to MySQL 5 just fine,
AFAIK.

Not in general, no, but in specific some people have issues during
upgrades if they set their collation to the wrong thing. This could be
fixed by converting their database, but in general it's simpler to
just tell them to remove the collation setting in wp-config.php.

WP itself runs fine under PHP 5, and more and more plugins are
requiring it nowadays.

PHP 4 is dead. It just has not stopped thrashing yet.

Thanks for the links.  Those are interesting themes.  

To correct you on a thought though, I'm not a theme designer, I'm a programmer.  I'm tackling this, not because it's going to save me time, but for the challenge of building the tool.  

My intention is not to create "a beast of a theme engine", but a replacement or supplement for the WordPress Theme Editor.  That is, I want to edit theme files.  The resulting theme can be very lightweight.

One possible approach to this is to build a database of code snippets and have ways of adding or removing these.  I have much more specific thoughts on this, but I'll save those for another post.  In the meantime, I'll be examining how these themes work.  I really like the Sandbox coding style, and the K2 column editor interface.

You're going to be better off creating more of a desktop like tool  
rather than anything web based. Think of it like a 'dreamweaver' that  
only speaks html, css, js, and wp template tags. In other words find  
the right tool for the job; to build the tool for this job.

That's certainly one possible direction.  From one perspective it would be easier to build the interface using desktop tools, and actually the whole app may be easier.  But it would be much harder to test whether the edited template is any good.  I think it would require users to setup PHP and Apache on the local machine.  On the web, the interface may be harder, but you have near-instant feedback as to your changes.  

Please explain why you think a desktop tool is better than a webtop tool.  

Alan

Phrasing may not matter much to us, but to the end-user it does.

As for the location of a "lengthy" phrase like that, it could simply
go right beneath the description text, in italics or a diff colour, or
something...

The WordPress db class (wp-db) only uses mysql_* calls, However, There  
should be no reason why a MySQLi based wp-db class couldnt be createed and  
used by those who want it.
(For reference: wp-config/db.php will be loaded in favour of  
wp-includes/wp-db.php if it exists, Just make sure to have all the same  
functions and whatnot in there :))

That's it.  I'm going with 42 pt pink lettering below the plugin  
Description.  :p

The phrasing is easily amended, but I do have to code it into the  
Plugins page in a particular location.  That is the _entirety_ of my  
question.  Phrasing only enters it in that we can't put a long  
sentence in a narrow table cell.

So to get back to the original inquiry -- pic one, or give me option 4:

1) Add text below Version # in the version cell of the row.  "Update not
checked"

2) Add text below Description, but in the same table cell.  Formatting  
to
distinguish it from the description text (italic?)

3) Icons instead of text???  Add it to the "Actions" column instead???
Other ideas?

Here's a test screenshot.  The top three plugins have a different  
version:

I thought i'd just throw my thought in here:
While not everyone likes it, At present, The plugins page has been  
seperated into 2 groups: Active, And Inactive plugins (as well as a  
recently activated list, but lets not worry about that right now); as a  
result of that, The Status column was removed.

Having an extra status column in the case where its 2 lists was useless.
(But: Please dont turn this into a lets change it back thread, its not  
what its about, Thoughts on how it can work with *both* layouts should be  
discussed)

Thoughts:
A row underneath the plugin saying "This plugin isnt checked for updated"  
looks messy to me, Too much space used up, potentially when there are a  
lot of plugins which do not appear on WordPress.org.
Having an extra column with the update information is kind of anoying,  
Theres too much text (Update available, Upgrade automatically, Version  
available) for a single discrete column
That was why a extra row was added for the plugin update notification,  
Generally, That row will only be there for a short time, as people will  
upgrade the plugin when they see it, Thats not going to happen with the  
non-hosted plugins, They're not going to uninstall or find a different  
plugin because of that if it does its job.

So that still leaves the question, What is left to actually show the  
plugin is not checked?

Maybe a paragraph at the top or bottom of the page:
"The following plugins cannot be automatically checked for updates, or  
upgraded automatically as they are not hosted on WordPress.org:  
<strong>Plugin 1, Testers Plugin 2, My In-development plugin 3</strong>"

Or maybe the text "<i>Cannot check for updates</i>" under the plugin name?

Not necessarily.  For testing purposes, you could replace the WP 
template tags with static content and save it to a temp html file that's 
opened in a browser.  Some things would be easier than others with this 
method (a paragraph or two of lorem ipsum for <?php the_content() ?> for 
example), but most things should be easily doable.

It might not be the best way to do it, but you'd at least get an idea of 
what your theme is going to look like with content, but without the 
weight of setting up a web LAMP/WAMP/etc stack.

This article: http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Converting_to_MySQLi
actually mentions a tool that simplifies the manual switching of code
to use the mysqli_* functions. Of course, it doesn't give any of the
other benefits like prepared statements, etc. Interestingly, they use
Wordpress as an example for using the code converter tool.

Aside from prepared statements and any of the implicit benefits
brought by mysqli, can anyone think of any other explicit advantages
to switching? Not to diminish the impact of what I just mentioned -
prepared statements is a great feature.

DD32 -- Good suggestion at the end there.  Beyond that, you're reading  
my mind. :)

Okay, here's another screenshot.  I don't have great vision, so I am  
normally against shrinking text; but it occurred to me that because  
this is a message that will repeat frequently and won't likely change  
much, there is no real harm in doing so.

Also, per DD32, I've removed the Status column, and I widened the  
Plugin Name column a bit:

http://striderweb.com/wp-content/docs/no-updates2.png

I'm definitely liking the notice in the version column.

I can't be the only person here who uses WP on internal-facing servers
with no external connectivity. Regardless if it's hosted by Google or
Wordpress, tying functionality to a persistent WAN connection will
cause a lot of trouble, especially in the corporate universe.

Subject: [wp-hackers] odd behaviour vs. global variables
Message-ID: <de824f710806120530o4bb84b40veb99576843bb84f2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was working on my plugin for Mollom (http://www.netsensei.nl/mollom) when
I started noticing some odd behaviour when declaring certain variables
global. For instance, If we create this simple plugin: (omitted the
obligatory header for brevity's sake)

function dosomething($do_comment) {
    global $do_comment; // let's declare it global
    print_r($do_comment);
    return $do_comment; // or alternatively: die();
}
add_action('preprocess_comment', 'dosomething');

The $do_comment variable seems to be non-existant or empty! Meaning
everything else breaks from here on as the input got lost somewhere along
the way. But when we remove the 'global $do_comment' line, everything works
like a charm and $do_comment  passes the commentdata $correctly.

Then again, why would you want to create extra global variables? Well, my
plugin contains several different functions which are referenced on several
occasions. Problem is mess with function signatures which make it easier for
me to pass variables through globals.

I know it's bad design and there are more gracious ways of passing stuff on.
Like using OOP. But then again, I wanted my plugin just to work and pass
data without getting it lost along the way.

imho, this is just odd behaviour and I was curious if the list could give me
some feedback or reasonable explanation on this one.

With regards,

Matthias Vandermaesen

In the function that handles my options page I've added

add_meta_box('fcbox','My box!','something_in_the_box','petition');
do_meta_boxes('petition','default',null);

and later I have

function something_in_the_box() {
    echo "Living in a box world!";
}

defined. But I don't see that box, or text anywhere on my page. Am I
calling do_meta_boxes wrongly (what should that third argument be?)?

I was wondering if there are solid standards about how a page comes together.  For example, are functions usually expected to create balanced HTML, or is it common to produce unbalanced code that must be closed off by another function?  For example, get_header() generates HTML which is incomplete without calling get_footer().    In cases like this, I could just pair off the two elements, and allow arbitrary stuff to be added between..

Obviously, the Codex is one of the best places to look for information 
on building templates. It contains information about the "standard" 
template structure, and how the files are broken up (header, footer, 
sidebar, index, single, page, etc.). I know somebody else already 
mentioned Sandbox, but I'll put in a second vote for looking to it as a 
good example of a "blank slate" template, ready to be shaped by CSS. I 
realize you've got more than that in mind, but it's still a good theme 
to learn from.

I would also recommend checking out the "One True Layout" article[1] for 
tips on how to get some of the flexibility you want just with CSS, and 
not having to resort to rearranging the HTML. Another framework for this 
is YUI Grids[2], which achieves a remarkable amount of layout 
flexibility simply by changing which classes you use on key HTML 
elements. They also have an online "builder" app[3], similar to (but 
more limited in scope) what you have in mind, I think.

Oh, and to answer another question, WP functions do their best to output 
valid XHTML snippets. Exactly what they output depends on the context of 
how it's normally used. For example, most of the list functions (e.g., 
wp_list_pages(), wp_get_archives(), etc) will output <li> tags, and 
expect that the wrapping <ul> or <ol> is already in the template. Again, 
look at existing themes for examples.

Here's one I've never really found an answer to: what's the WP2.2+

Most people (and I) still use the Settings section, while others are  
location them on the Plugins section instead.

Any insight on this, or is it just a matter of choice?

I posted far too soon - I should have used

add_meta_box('fcbox','My box!','something_in_the_box','petition');
do_meta_boxes('petition','advanced',null);

Which does result in something_in_the_box() being called although it
looks like there's some CSS and/or Javascript missing at this point.
What do I need to be including?

Message-ID: <48515FF1.3030906@warproof.com>

Hey all,

My latest plugin 
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/featurific-for-wordpress/) performs 
a bunch of initialization during activation.  However, if the activation 
generates PHP errors (e.g. file not found, etc.), they are not reported 
to the user.  The problem is that I know that errors are being 
generated.  If I call the activation method from another method, the PHP 
errors are successfully reported.

What's wrong?  Is this the default behavior of Wordpress?  And if so, 
how can I work around it?

Thanks so much in advance! :)

I'm worried about the impact of prepared statements not using the query
cache at all for older MySQL versions.

    7.5.4. The MySQL Query Cache
    http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/query-cache.html

See the 5th paragraph (3rd "Note").

Beginning with 5.1.17 prepared statements use the query cache under
certain conditions as described in

    http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/query-cache-how.html

Search for "prepared statements" to find the relevant section.

Beginning with 5.1.21 the cache is used in more cases.

I'm still running the 5.0 branch of MySQL, and many are probably
still stuck with 4.x.

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

 From the #wordpress-dev channel earlier today:

Thu Jun 12 21:09:34 UTC 2008	aaroncampbell	I tagged a new version of one  
of my plugins in WordPress extend last night (about 6 hours ago), and it's  
still not showing.  http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-google-analytics/
Thu Jun 12 21:09:41 UTC 2008	aaroncampbell	The new version is 1.2.2, and  
it looks like it says 1.2.2 for the stable tag in the trunk readme, and it  
looks like the 1.2.2 tag directory is there, and it looks like the readme  
and main file in the 1.2.2 tag directory both say 1.2.2
Thu Jun 12 21:09:43 UTC 2008	aaroncampbell	However, the site is still  
offering up 1.2.1 http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-google-analytics/
Thu Jun 12 22:44:14 UTC 2008	mdawaffe  	aaroncampbell: looks like a  
networking issue somewhere in our servers - will try to get it fixed soon
Thu Jun 12 22:48:11 UTC 2008	aaroncampbell	mdawaffe: Thanks, as far as  
that plugin goes, the 1.2.1 to 1.2.2 upgrade is pretty critical.  However,  
in the scheme of things, the whole plugin as actually rather minor.  Just  
wanted to make sure someone knew what was up (and get a second pair of  
eyes to make sure I didn't miss something...it's happened before)
Thu Jun 12 22:49:05 UTC 2008	mdawaffe  	thanks for letting me know, I  
think a whole lot of plugins are behind the times because of the same  
issue.  Looks like it happened yesterday sometime

That plugin is reporting the latest version again.. But there might be  
some remaining issues still..

Did you update the version in the readme.txt? Does it match the version
in the plugin? If yes, perhaps search the archives for more info:

I do like notice in version clumn too... it's more visible, the one in

Prepared statements is the only reason I can think of to switch. And
except in a few cases, I'm not sure that those would help WordPress a
whole lot.

The most obvious place that prepared statements would help would be
the wp_options table. On a complex site, those queries are frequent
and all similar in structure. But for most of the rest, there's not a
lot of benefit. The wp_posts pull is the biggest query, and it's built
on the fly based on lots of factors, so it's not going to gain a
tremendous improvement there.

Security-wise, mysqli is safer both in the use of prepared statements
(explicitly being able to define types for data is a very good thing),
and in the login functionality (mysqli uses the new security / login
model that was introduced in MySQL 4.1).

However, speed-wise, most tests and benchmarks I can find suggest that
mysqli is somewhat slower at straight queries than mysql. The
differences I've seen seem to be significant, but only in the
multi-thousands queries range.

Looking through 2.5.1, I see that there are no mysql_* calls outside
of wpdb right now, so it is entirely possible to convert that file and
use the wp-content/db.php hook thing to replace it on your own site,
if somebody wants to test the idea out and run some benchmarks.
There's only roughly 20 calls to replace, and replacing them is fairly
simple and straightforward to do. However, the benchmarks are likely
to show that mysqli is (fractionally) slower without use of prepared
statements.

And the use of prepared statements is much a bigger challenge. There's
SELECTS and such sprinkled all over the code. A new model would likely
need to be designed for that, one that keeps the prepared statements
somewhere centralized, so that functions can a) create them if needed
and b) reuse them when they get called again.

$do_comment is a local variable before the global keyword. After the
global keyword $do_comment refers to the uninitialized global. You
must use an assignment. The global keyword doesn't work the way you
assumed.

function dosomething($comment) {

Totally normal and expected given your snippet.

dosomething() runs with a variable given by the add_action, which content 
goes into $do_comment. But then on first line of the function you're 
telling it: don't care about what you've been sent in, use the global 
variable instead! Which is probably empty since you probably didn't 
declare it anywhere.

In other words:

$do_comment = 'hello';
function dosomething($do_comment) {
    global $do_comment; 
    print_r($do_comment);
    return $do_comment;
}
add_action('preprocess_comment', 'dosomething');

This will always return 'hello', no matter what's actually sent into 
dosomething().

Suggestion: read again some PHP docs about variable scope :)

Harder might be <?php get_header() ?>.  Or if someone wants to design the sidebars, we're looking at incomplete documents.  I suppose we could also add a generic context, and that would work provided the files are well behaved.  Generic context won't work if the header says <div id="bluegreen">, as the sidebars would miss out on the styling.  Then again, if we use index.php as the context, that could work.  Of course 404.php might have a different structure.

You have a good idea.  My biggest concern is not handling all the unknown php stuff in rendering HTML.  Ignoring function calls doesn't seem like the best idea.

Well, if we don't worry about perfect results, it could very well be much easier.

Attachment taxonomies work. They are not included in core. I don't
know if a trac ticket exists to add them. It's already been done in
plugins. I just asked Matt to publish his.

There were code examples in core a while back:

The main gotcha is that to "understand" a system of G complexity, you
have to write your system with at least G+1 complexity. G?del, etc.

You need something to act as an interpreter of PHP, with awareness of  
wp template tags. It needs to generate and edit theme files that not  
only are whole and complete html files, but have all the appropriate  
tags, file names and other bits that turns it from a template to a  
fully functional wp theme. The tool should tell them the theme is okay  
- forcing them to check it out on the web is kludgy and inefficient.

If the user (or your tool) outputs a bad set of files, then you've  
just corrupted their site. Easy to reverse maybe, but most users will  
probably not go through the trouble of setting up a local server, so  
you can be sure your tool will be used on their live site.

All in all, I think that you haven't thought through the problems your  
app is trying to solve enough. And given your insistence on doing it  
on the web says to me that you are limiting yourself and your thinking  
to what you know. When you only have one hammer, everything looks like  
a nail... even when its a screw.

Its not whether or not it would work on the web or not, I just don't  
think PHP is an appropriate tool to use.

Good Luck,

You are misunderstanding how PHP works with global/local variables.

When you put
    global $var_abc;
inside of a function, that says that inside this function, when you 
type $var_abc, you are referring to the global version of $var_abc.

So your function is ignoring the passed-in local version of 
$do_comment, in favor of the global $do_comment (which presumably has 
not been defined).

Here is what you need to do to fix this (or something similar):

// this is the global variable,
// which you need to declare outside the function
$do_comment = 0;

// use a different name for your local variable argument
function dosomething($do_comment_loc) {

     global $do_comment;

     $do_comment = $do_comment_loc;

     print_r($do_comment);
     return $do_comment_loc; // or alternatively: die();
}

add_action('preprocess_comment', 'dosomething');

The declaration statement

global $do_comment;

is the same as saying

$do_comment = $GLOBALS['do_comment'];

so effectively you're re-defining $do_comment, losing the value that
was passed to the function.

Message-ID: <4852981B.40606@byu.net>

Hey all,

My latest plugin 
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/featurific-for-wordpress/) performs 
a bunch of initialization during activation.  However, if the activation 
generates PHP errors (e.g. file not found, etc.), they are not reported 
to the user.  The problem is that I know that errors are being 
generated.  If I call the activation method from another method, the PHP 
errors are successfully reported.

What's wrong?  Is this the default behavior of Wordpress?  And if so, 
how can I work around it?

Thanks so much in advance! :)

I actually believe plugins should go under what they do. If the plugin
primarily changes your theme, it should go under design. If it adds
features to the comments, it should go there.

While sticking everything under "plugins" is easier for the first
couple times a user needs to find the plugin, after that point, the
plugin has become an inseparable part of the blog and I stop thinking
of it as a "plugin" and more as just part of the install.

At this point, it makes far more sense to look for it under what it
does. Especially, if it is a plugin that I only use once every couple
months.

Of all the plugins I have installed, I only have one plugin listed
under "plugins." Most are under "manage" or "settings."

The majority of people believe settings belong under Settings and stuff
related to plugin management, etc. belongs under Plugins.

The function activate_plugin, defined in wp-admin/includes/plugin.php,
uses output buffering to check for fatal errors upon activation.  You
can comment out the call to output buffering functions there to see
the errors.

The global $do_comment line brings the global $do_comment variable into 
local scope.

This overrides the $do_comment variable passed into the function.

If you the global variable and the function argument differently then 
both will be available.

Here's my take on it:

Plugins should be invisible.  That is, _the fact that it is a plugin_
should be invisible.  The best design for a plugin is to seamlessly blend
into the existing interface so that someone who didn't already know would
not realize that it's an "add on" to the system.

Therefore, if you have a plugin that has something to do with managing
plugins, put the screen under Plugins.  If it just has a basic settings,
screen, put it under Settings.  If the screen lets the user _manage_
something, then "Manage" is the right place.

I have a plugin that lets people easily put pull-quotes into a post.  The
admin screen for that plugin allows people to set options that control what
the pull-quotes look like.  I put the screen under "Design" (or "Themes")
because **that's where it made the most sense**.

So:  Don't make your plugin scream "this is a plugin" to the end user.  If
it were going to be part of core, what menu would you expect the screen to
be under?  Put it there.

(On a related not, the header on the top of your plugin's page should not
say "Such and Such Plugin" -- it should just say "Such and Such".)

Hope that helps. :)

The only problem I see is that not everyone runs 640x480 or whatever. :P

I'd hate for the rows to get too much taller...

Subject: [wp-hackers] PHP 4/5 Classes and WP filters. $this is not working.
Message-ID: <44816a1f0806131659g54304118k1dfafd9fba5719a4@mail.gmail.com>

In one of my plugins I just noticed that it works great on PHP 5 and
not on PHP 4. I dind't start using classes until PHP 5, but I've
narrowed it down to the $this keyword used in filters. Below you will
find a brief snippet of the scripts involved, please let me know if
you can see why there would be an issue.

The problems I'm having are weird and are specific to my plugin, but
they don't cause PHP errors and go away if I change the filters from
$this to the actual class name. It seems to me that $this is referring
to two different things. One in the contents add_filter and one in the
remove_filter. I tried moving everything inside the first init()
function outside, but it didn't change anything.

My guess is that it has to do with the way the class is being called,
but I'm not sure what part is causing it.

Thanks,

Aaron

p.s. If anyone is interested, the plugin causing the trouble is the
latest SVN version of
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajaxd-wordpress/. The problem is
occurring when inline posts are being loaded with AJAX.

p.p.s. I can explain the logic behind what is going on if needed or wanted.

function init() {
	include_once('aclassfile.php');
	include_once('anotherclassfile.php');

	if(count($classes) > 0){ // $classes is just an array of class names.
		foreach($classes as $class){
			$$class = null;
			global $$class;
			$$class = new $class;
		}
		reset($awp_init);
		foreach($classes as $class){
			$$class->init();
		}
	}
}

	init();
	do_action('awp_ajax_type_post');


aclassfile.php
_____________________

$classes[] = 'AWP_inlineposts';

class AWP_inlineposts {

	function init(){
		$this->awp_live();
		add_action('awp_ajax_type_post', 'AJAX');
	}

	function awp_live(){
		add_filter('the_content', array($this,'afunction'),-10,1);
	}

	function AJAX($content){

		remove_filter('the_content', array($this,'afunction'),-10,1);

		$response[] = apply_filters('the_content',$content);
	}

Thanks for the response, Austin!  I'd like to configure my plugin so 
that the errors are accessible on all installations automatically, 
without having to edit plugin.php.  Does anyone know how I might do so?

The function activate_plugin, defined in wp-admin/includes/plugin.php,
uses output buffering to check for fatal errors upon activation.  You
can comment out the call to output buffering functions there to see
the errors.

I didn't read the OP so maybe this isn't what you're looking for but
at a glance I can say you need &$this.

It is the default behaviour.
Upon a fatal error in activation, it should redirect back to the plugin  
page with:
"Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error.
<Small inline frame here which contains the fatal error messages generated  
by the plugin>"
The iframe simply tries to activate the plugin once again, it should hit  
the fatal error then again too.

It should work properly if you pass $this by reference to the array in 
add_filter/add_action.

I agree, which is why I shrank the text size just a bit.  Also, I  
don't think it will be a problem except for plugins with unusually  
short descriptions.  Most plugins I have have a description section  
that is at least four or five lines tall, so...  some height increase  
but not huge.

I'm going to go forward with a patch with that interface.

Thanks Jeremy. I don't *think* I'll be worrying about this "issue / 
concern" anymore. I used that plugin before, and I think it was quirky 
or something, so I stopped using it. It has ALOT of options, just too 
much for me to worry about managing and such. I'll just make most 
authors > contributors or whatever for now. Thanks everyone for your

Looks like I've been using WordPress over IPv6 since May of 2006.

The only glitch was when validation of IP addresses (for the comment
table) was introduced, it didn't initially account for IPv6.

AFAICT WordPress supports IPv6 as is.  The open proxy checks probably
still only do IPv4 lookups, but I don't think there are any open proxy
blacklists for IPv6 yet.  (I might be just out-of-touch, though.)

(Since I was checking... I've been using WordPress since May of 2004
and IPv6 since August of 2000.  Just not together until May of 2006.)

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

Since we are talking about a template editor, what we need is a backup of the template only.  They won't corrupt their entire site.  Ultimately the only reliable test is to put the files on the site, and see what gets produced.  And when that happens, the author better have a backup in case the results turn out to be not what she wanted.  

Besides that, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest interpreting PHP is waayy beyond what I want to attempt.  I think the other poster is on to something with Renard.  By substituting HTML for PHP, we can approximate the end result, and that could work as an external tool.

I agree I haven't fully thought through the problems, and that's why
I'm discussing the issues on the forum.  More talk will help us come to
a better plan before I start coding.

Huh?  I'm not *insisting* on a web interface.  Read my post again!  I also wrote:

Do you have another suggestion?  I suppose it's wide open for everything from C# to Perl.

That's only if you intend a total system.  The editor I'm contemplating needs only to understand the structure of PHP files, and not their meaning.  This means it should be a good deal less complex than the PHP interpreter.  To make things easier for myself, I don't even intend the editor to fully parse PHP/XHTML.  Just enough to cover the basic templates.

That project looks like a good reference point for what to cover.

Hi All,

I have a plugin that hooks into 'save_posts' to keep a digest of each post
in a separate table. Now that the post revision system has been introduced I
am getting entries for all the post revisions too. Is there a better hook to
use or must I check the post_type before I do the digest?

Message-ID: <485608E6.9060607@mullenweg.com>

The idea is but a foal, but some of the more observant amoung you have 
noticed the new branch in the WP subversion, crazyhorse.

Basically the idea is to create a one-time sandbox for experimentation 
on a number of different approaches to the WP interface, which will then 
be systematically tested (with lasers!) and different elements compared 
to 2.5 and 2.3.

The crazyhorse repository is here:

http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/crazyhorse/

I hope within a few weeks to have it resemble the look and functionality 
outlined in this PDF (beta):

http://ma.tt/dropbox/2008/06/wordpress-prototype-1.1.pdf

(Just a work in progress, there will be more of these.)

Like a movie set, some things (like global search) will probably be left 
as placeholders. 95% of effort will be on the front end functionality, 
and if the idea sticks we'll make it more robust.

A few notes:

* This is an experiment!
* Releases will still always be named for jazz musicians.
* We will be free with commit access to the crazyhorse branch in the 
interest of expediting the prototype -- this doesn't change policy or 
access for core committers.
* The branch will be highly volatile.
* If you want to help out with this sprint, speak up. :)

This document is really interesting, and some ideas it present sound
really cool, so cool that i have change my mind about the opportunity
to have a new design so early after the big change of 2.5. I will set
up a local tesbed to experiment all these new stuff to give some
feedbacks in the future. Maybe i will put a online version to let a
large audience of our italian community to access it and give
feedbacks too.

Love to experiment :)

First blush impressions:

1) The interface is a fairly close function-alike to Tiger Admin
and/or Fluency Admin.
2) The return of the draggable elements is a welcome one.
3) The quick post widget is a waste of space, IMNSHO. I know it's
looking to save some clicks, but you could go one further and save
yourself clicking through to the admin interface entirely and simply
install a Prologue-alike theme to allow posting from the front page.
4) Testing with frickin' lasers might not be the best overall plan
unless they come pre-attached to ill-tempered mutant sea bass.
5) Who's the Neil Young fan?

Not bad.. even if i would prefere horizontal menu to vertical ones.

++1 for me too and i think lot of people will agree.

I agree too, considering that for a quick post using the new
bookmarklet function can do the same iI agree is a waste of space.

I love the  comments that show up editing a post, would be usfull to
have them visible during an editing to complete/integrate a post

Firefox has a system where, when you upgrade, addon's that are not
tagged as being compatible with the new version are automatically
deactivated. This prevents incompatible plugins from horking things
up. It is not without flaws, but in general it works very well.

WordPress could introduce a new plugin field, "max version" or
something similar, where a plugin can specify this as well. It could
then keep incompatible plugins from being activated on upgrades.

Discuss.

I was thinking about something like this lately, but my conclusion
(for what it's worth) is that it would lead to more trouble than gain.
Most plugins on wp.org/extend are tagged compatible up to XXX because
they were made when it was version XXX. Now we have version YYY,
plugin still runs fine but the author didn't update the readme.txt to
bump version compatibility up.

Some plugin authors (like me) are too lazy or forgetful to update their
plugin's max version when new versions of WP come out.  That doesn't mean
that they don't work, but they could get incorrectly flagged.  So my
question is this, is it better to inconvenience people using plugins that do
work fine or the people using plugins that won't work?

Discuss.

D'oh! I didn't see this email.  I'll blame gmail for not updating.  Or maybe

I actually think it's not a problem to put a bit bigger of a burden on  
the plugin
authors. I think we should prevent our users from encountering ill  
maintained
plugins... There's just no room for laziness here ;)

It seems likely that this would cause more problems than it would solve:

* It breaks private or custom plugins.  Firefox lets extension authors
specify an update URL specific to that extension, so that updates can
be downloaded from a custom location.  WordPress has the wordpress.org
API hard-coded into the code.  So WordPress setups using custom
plugins would 1) never notify their users of updates 2) would
consequently lose their functionality upon upgrades.

This is not a trivial problem: I try to write plugins for clients with
a large degree of forwards-compatibility, and although I can't
guarantee that all future versions of WordPress will be supported, for
the most part they have been.  The max version proposal would mean
that someone would have to increment the max version for every custom
plugin, even ones that work fine; this means greater expense for
businesses and more time wasted for owners of self-hosted blogs.

* The risk of upgrades causing significant problems is low.
1) Most of the time using the WordPress API keeps you from
encountering problems.  I frequently use plugins that haven't been
updated since WP 2.0, and on a few sites I'm still running some from
1.5 with no problems.  The exceptions are unusual, such as the change
in 2.3 in the taxonomy.
2) Matt Mullenweg stated recently that WordPress upgrades will no
longer involve significant stepwise changes, for this very reason of
not breaking setups.

* There are possible better ways:
1) The (future) automatic WP upgrade could simply warn users about
wordpress.org plugins that have a "Tested up to:" version that is too
low, and let them decide if they want to disable them.
2) Or the automatic WP upgrade could de-activate all plugins, then
re-activate them in turn and catch fatal errors.  This would have the
advantage of testing functionality rather than version numbers.

So someone who spends 10 minutes writing a simple plugin and then
uploads it to the repository for the benefit of other people, will
then be *required* to update the plugin each time a new version of
WordPress is released?

Remember, just because someone wrote a plugin doesn't mean you have
the right to tell them they must keep it updated.

-1, it'd be a pain to keep those version numbers up to date and people would
just end up setting the max-version to like "10.0.0".

1/2 the Firefox extensions I use that aren't marked as 3.0 compatible work
fine for me, so really it doesn't work as well as intended IMO.

I really like the changes that are being made!  It's not clear to me based
on that PDF how someone gets to the pages to manage posts and whatnot.  I'm

Firstly I disagree with automatically disabling the plugins which are not
tagged as compatible. But, a reminder system would be good for developers
who are just forgetful...

When the plugin author adds thier plugin they are given the option to
recieve reminders when their plugin needs updating. If selected, they will
then recieve an email like this when a new version of WP is available:

====================

Hey, <Author name>!

A new version of WordPress has recently been released!
Is your ['Foo' plugin][1] compatible with the new [2.5.2 version][2]?

We would recommend updating it, so as many users as possible can enjoy it.

*To let people know when your plugin works with the newest version, [click
here][3] to update your *'*Compatible up to' version number on [the plugin's
page][4]. That way, users can be safe in the knowledge your plugin will work
as expected.

Thanks,
WordPress.org

====================

[1] Link to the plugin page
[2] Version release blog post or Trac link
[3] The edit plugin page, with a #compatible-up-to at the end of the link,
so that text box is focussed and has a colour around it perhaps?
[4] **Link to the plugin page

====================

Becuase it's an opt in thing, devs who create quick plugins and dont want to
update their plugin won't recieve reminders; but those of us who are just
forgetful will be reminded.

Just an idea, any thoughts?

Alex

No argument, however that would be a valid option for somebody to do.
You can do that with Firefox extensions as well. Few people do,
however.

Still, for a plugin which is always going to work (say it's something
simple, like a mere filter on the_content), then marking it as forward
compatible for several versions is a valid choice to make.

I greatly disagree with that assessment.

When I upgraded to FF3 RC3, several extensions of mine stopped
working. When I manually overrode that behavior, FF3 would crash on
startup. I had to switch to safe mode to disable them and get it
working again. Later, newer versions of those extensions were
released, and FF3 notified me and upgraded them.

Yes, same here, not all of my extensions worked under FF3, but a greater
number did which is why I have extensions.checkCompatibility disabled.

But anyway, as long as it's optional for developers, it's fine by me.

There was discussion recently about adding a _minimum_ WP version to  
plugins.  This I would certainly support.

I don't like the idea of a "shut it down" max version.  Not even sure  
if I like a notification....  Are people really having big problems  
with this?

1) A plugin author can hook after_plugin_row (or something like that)  
and add his own custom update notice if he chooses.

2) Hopefully, not-checked/unknown notification is coming: <http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5117 
 >.  The patch is made; it's waiting on approval and a change in the  
update server output.

Each time a new release approaches, there is a codex page listing 
compatible/incompatible plugins.

Perhaps we can do that the other way around: disabling the plugins that 
are known to be incompatible. That would certainly save a lot of 
headaches for the users (and calm down the support forum just after 
release).

Te remainder email sounds good.

A fair number of the problems on the support forums are due to
incompatible/broken plugins after a new release. And people never
really believe us when we say to disable all their plugins and switch
to the default theme to test the problems out.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Discussion about Optional Closing PHP tags in the
	WordPress Library
Message-ID: <4858557F.7090600@santosj.name>

You know, it is a really good thing that the discussion is a closed 
matter. The Coding Standards aren't up for debate, however, there are 
some issues I've come across, which I would like some input on how it 
can be addressed in the least amount of elitism as possible. Luckily, 
everyone here is educated enough to understand the debate, so it should 
be more about solutions than debating about something.

The first problem I've encountered is a Trac ticket, which questioned 
the lack of a closing PHP tag at the end of a file. It was handled 
pretty well. The coding standard states that all library files and PHP 
file have a closing PHP tag. Sort of like XHTML, you have a opening tag, 
then you have closing tag, even if it is optional (like HTML). So the 
tag was added, end of story.

Right, so the problem is this. If you leave the closing PHP tag out, 
then you have people informing you that you have a bug since PHP 
"requires" a closing PHP tag.

The second problem is in #7149, where you have the opposite problem. A 
new line is accidentally added to the end of a WordPress library file 
causing errors to occur in the execution. The solution is to remove the 
offending new lines and carry on with your merry day. However, so a 
"solution" came in, which really isn't a very good one. To avoid 
worrying about new lines creeping into files and causing issues, you 
could remove all of the closing PHP tags from those files (see problem #1).

I'm not sure if there is a proper channel for relaying PHP 
troubleshooting to users or if one should exist. The problem doesn't 
affect enough people to actually do anything code wise. If there isn't 
already, would a Common Troubleshooting page on the WordPress Codex for 
PHP errors that come up be helpful? You could just point them to that page?

Really, from the commonly quoted message on the subject, the conclusion 
translates to that it is better to have the closing PHP tag, so that 
those who don't know better don't get tripped up on the small stuff. 
Whether or not WordPress should have the closing PHP tag is not at issue 
here. How is this problem, when it occurs troubleshooted for users?

I'm not sure my response, "Learn PHP!" would be all that helpful and 
could come across as being an ass.

Thanks.

It may not be all that helpful, but I'm also not sure it's that far 
off.  In my opinion, anyone messing with files that are part of the 
WordPress core (all files that WordPress is responsible for managing), 
should understand PHP enough to handle the problem.  If they don't, they 
shouldn't be bringing the problems to WordPress.  I'd say just make a 
page that offers common PHP errors, explain that if they are being 
caused by WordPress with no modifications, that a ticket should be 
opened.  However, if WordPress has been modified at all, look for help 
at ______ (list some places, ##PHP on IRC, htmlforums.com, possibly paid 
support through the wp-pro list, etc).

If this is a problem with patch submitters and not users, then I 
honestly don't know the solution, except to maybe highlight it somewhere 
along the process of submitting a patch.

I don't really see how this could be of any matter to the end user. If
there's a problem, they should upload the file again. Problem solved.

The one exception is wp-config.php where it's best to leave the end tag off
due to how easy it is for a novice and their editor to add a trailing
whitespace.

Depends, it is more likely than not, that the person that filed in the 
ticket in question did open the file in their editor to figure out where 
a function is. Some editors have issues (Dreamweaver) with the different 
styles and doubling the new lines.

To answer your question, if it was more of a problem, then there would 
be a lot more people facing the problem, so I doubt that the exception 
will be made. My opinion of course.

Actually, it is probably that no one edits their wp-config.php file 
after WordPress makes it. I doubt many end users are going to do it, 
even if it should be done for the SECRET_KEY constant.

I suppose there should be some way to tell people who face this issue 
that they shouldn't be editing PHP without making them feel like they 
are idiots and shouldn't be editing PHP.

Sigh, actually, I do know of a couple more instances where the dreaded 
double new lines caused issues and tickets on the Trac. Just close as 
invalid and inform the submitter that the problem is not the fault of 
WordPress. Just one solution I suppose.

Is it kinda obvious though that people who don't know what they're doing
shouldn't be editing the core files? It's no different from randomly pulling
hoses and wires out from under your car's hood. If a user doesn't know not
to be doing that, then they have bigger issues to deal with.

PHP does not  require the closing tag, as it is assumed when the file 
ends. Also, not specifying the closing ?> helps prevent (often hard to 
debug) accidents like the addition of trailing whitespace, which will 
cause, for instance, session initialization to fail.

I seem to recall very early in my PHP hacking days being told that I  
was _supposed_ to leave a single line break at the end of the file  
after the closing "?>"

Best of intentions + bad advice =  what the heck is wrong _now_???

Requiring you to leave off the closing ?> is just sloppy. At the very  
least it discourages mindful coding, and being aware of common bugs.  
Its akin to leaving off the semicolon... you're going to get an error.

And I have to disagree to the previous poster, these issues are not  
hard to debug and very easy to diagnose.

Can you provide us with instructions on how to reproduce this?

Looking at one of Matt's galleries:

http://ma.tt/2008/06/exploring-ios/

...the markup on Matt's page doesn't contain anything like you describe.

Perhaps it is a problem with your theme -- can you reproduce it with the
default theme? Your theme should contain the code:

<?php do_action('wp_head'); ?>

Does it?

Open up a terminal, set the text to be green-on-black, type "hjkl" a few

I'm going to politely disagree with your comment here, leaving off the ?>
when the file contains only PHP code, or ends in a block of PHP code will
not generate an error.  This is well documented (
http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.instruction-separation.php)
and actually is recommended use.  Projects such as Zend Framework have
actually made this a part of their coding standards to prevent just these
sort of problems.  It is hardly a sloppy practice, it is simply a different
practice, and one that make sense in the light of this problem.

I hear that you can hook a fax machine up to an ipod and tape it to a screen

As has probably been pointed out, this is incorrect. PHP does not
require the closing tag, and it is in fact recommended practice to
leave off the closing tag when the file ends with a block of PHP code.

This is the recommended coding standard for virtually all PHP projects
out there, WordPress being the notable exception.

No, actually the correct conclusion is that it is better to omit the
closing tag in all cases where it is not needed. And, in fact, I
recommend people remove it from wp-config on a regular basis.

This is, in fact, a huge and often repeated problem that occurs
regularly on the support forums. So much so that we have made several
statements in the codex about it. Search the forums for "Cannot modify
header information - headers already sent". This is almost always
caused by a blank line somewhere.. And 80% of the time it's in the
wp-config.php file.

Also, people create the wp-config.php file manually, because the
installation instructions tell them to do so. They don't let WordPress
create it for them, even though it can. In fact, I pointed out to
somebody the other day that it was capable of doing this, and they
were amazed. People who have used WP for years have no idea that it
could create your wp-config file for you.

Just something to keep in mind. And I recommend that we remove the
closing ?> from *all* files that end with it.

It is in fact, absolutely NOTHING like leaving off the semi colon.

It is good practice for files that only include PHP code. For example, 
it is a _required_ coding standard for a number of PHP projects, 
including the Zend Framework.

This causes the whitespace to be injected into the content sent to the 
end user and very often causes session initialization issues (ie, 
"headers already sent") errors.

Hi,

I have installed wordpress mu in our corporate intranet for further
customization.  But i could not login if i install in intranet.  it displays
a message "cookies are disabled".

Whn I debugged, i find that setcookie function in wp-login.php is not
setting the cookie properly..

The same problem exists in 1.3.3 and also 1.5.1 of the MU.

I dont know if its a bug or only a problem at my machine.

Regards,
Senthil Raja

I would rather not, since it's in "production", but it's not the theme it 
depends on, it's the code that replaces the [gallery] string in every post.

I see from the links Benedict provides (ticket #6496) that this is a known 
issue... Too bad it hasn't been fixed yet.

yes it does


For an example... look at the source code of http://hovenko.no/blog/ around 
line 85. The style-element is invalid inside of <body /> in xhtml.

The first menu move give a good impression but, there is always a but,
the text is to big the colomn consume lot of space and i some case
menu text flow on 2 lines (e.g. active akismet and check it's menu
entry added to plugin section... actualy the menu is 16px i tried 14
and it's better... i qould like to have a 12px but i suppose for most
people would be to much little

Maybe would be great for this crazyhorse testbed to try a full
conversion to ems maybe, cause 16px is the stardad font size for IE
and FF and i suppose quite all browser, and large percentage of end
users never change this, cause ooften they doesn't know how to do)
making the base font 0.625em to have a base font of 10px  so will be
easy set in a tipical environment havin 1.2em pfor a 12px 1.4 for 14px
etc, I'm testing it actually in a new version of wordpress italy site
(testbed not online)

So...is it fixed for 2.5.2 or for 2.6?  because 2.6 isn't due out for 
nearly two months, which is quite a while to wait for a bug fix.

Hmm, it may or may not be committed. I'm not sure:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6380

But regardless, bugfixes go into the 2.5 branch, so you won't have to wait
for 2.6. ;)

No, it causes nothing, because PHP ignores the first line break after 
the closing PHP tag. If you had two, then you would have issues.

I should probably correct you in saying that I already know that the 
closing PHP tag is optional and have known about it for about a year or 
two now. You may notice the title and the various references in my 
original post pointing that out. I don't need people "correcting" me on 
something I'm already well aware of.

If you read the sentence again, you might notice I was speaking in the 
voice of /other people/ and not of myself. You are the second person to 
take out the context the sentence and twist it into something it is not. 
If I didn't write clearly enough, then I'm sorry I didn't explain it 
better for those who like flame-baiting, same goes for the other guy. It 
is obvious that both the subject line and the various hints that I know 
what I'm talking about didn't quite get through to the both of you.

I would write next time, "I know what I'm talking about!" However the 
previous attempts with that disclaimer have backfired quite badly, so 
I'm not going to start doing that again.

On the subject of Coding Standards, there are advantages and 
disadvantages, so much so that you are pissing in the wind trying to 
debate the subject. Which is why I stopped after the first attempt to 
get the closing PHP tag removed. You should be wise to do the same, 
because it isn't going to happen. Something that is a matter of 
preference is very difficult to debate, because there are hardly any 
"facts" that will convince someone otherwise.

This discussion is not about convincing the commit team that the closing 
PHP tag should be removed. From you reply, it appears to be a bigger 
issue than I had thought. From the codex references, it also appears 
that those on the forums aren't using Google to their advantage. I 
suggest stop answering their questions or pointing them to Google.

You know, I really wish I had saved that page, but alas I'm not going to 
spend an hour or two finding the page again. What it comes down to was 
that the senior developer of PHP was telling the novice user of PHP, 
that since the novice did not realize that it could be removed, that the 
novice should not remove it. When you get into optional parameters, the 
novice might forget that in some instances it is required and until the 
novice realizes when the closing PHP tag is required and when it is not, 
then the novice user should always have the closing PHP tag.

This was also one my main points back when I did debate the issue. Look 
where we are now? At the same place where the closing PHP tag is still 
required in WordPress as a Coding Standard. Funny huh?

Ah. So there is some firewood for switching. However, the main debate is 
that WordPress should follow the standards, opening tag must have 
closing tag. If you leave off the closing PHP tag, then you violate this 
principle. I don't think it is logical to compare PHP, which is a 
programming language, to XHTML which is markup. I don't believe there is 
a comparsion, even if markup can be used in PHP. If you think about it 
in the frame of Opcodes, where there isn't any closing PHP tag anyway, 
then I don't think the principle applies.

I should mention that since I started using WordPress, that I've never 
once read the manual all the way through or at least by the time I did, 
after the third or fourth time of using the automatic wp-config.php 
creator, I knew that it could do so already. I don't believe there are 
many popular PHP applications which don't create the configuration file 
for you. My focus is limited however, but there were never an instance 
where I had to create the configuration file myself. May had to edit a 
few for the Database, but the file was already available.

I install WordPress MU on internal sites (mainly localhost) all the
time and never have a problem.

Make sure that the hostname you are accessing MU by is the same as the
one you installed it with (in particular, you should never access it
via an IP address).

Yeah, but Install4Free only do non-commercial (non-profit or personal)
installations. We send commercial people to the wp-pro mailing list.

Also, we don't do upgrades, plugins, or themes. Very vanilla.

Yes..  i did the same..  later i edited etc/hosts file to map the ip to some
internet like address and tried installing it.  it works fine.

localhost doesnt work, and that's understandable.

eg:

http://senthil/   --> can install and view home page.  But could not login.

http://senthil.domain.com --> can do everything.. including admin login.

the problem i traced is that in wp-login.php, the cookie could NOT be set,
if installed in intranet url.

one possible reason is that the cookie will not be set, if there is already
a header output in the buffer.

Senthil

Not necessarily. You can remove the style with a plugin pretty easily,
it gets run through the 'gallery_style' filter.

What is the best way to prevent people downloading a specific version
of one of your plugins on Wordpress.org/extend? Is deleting the tag an
acceptable approach?

(Context: I just found a security hole in one of my plugins, I'd like
to stop people from downloading that version)

You should check this way to proceed with wp-pro, because in the last  
days that list was fullfilled with people with "install this for $5"  
kind of request, and some of the pro's are a little upset with  
install4free for that... Please read out the archives of that list to  
know more.

I suggest to alert people that wp-pro is a professional list, and not  
a "it won't take you more than five minutes" kind of list, before  
redirecting them to wp-pro. It will save time for each of us :-)

Here's what we tell people requesting commercial blogs at install4free:

<quote>
Your site appears to be of a commercial nature. Install4Free is a service 
intended for personal blog sites. People requesting installation for 
commercial sites are better served by joining the wp-pro email list at 
http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-pro and submitting a request 
to that email list.

I have two points to add to this conversation.

First, cost is not how much money you pay for something, it is how much you
are willing to lose to get something. 1500$ may be what someone is willing
to lose to not have to learn how to install Wordpress on their own. We all
say that it only takes us 5 minutes to install, but to a complete newbie, it
takes much longer (maybe even days). They may not know what a database is,
what sort of webhost to look for, how to get the setup information, etc.
When you look at it like that, an IT Director may be willing to spend 1500$
to get someone to do 5 minutes worth of work (and do it correctly) instead
of paying an newbie staff member a few days worth of salary to guess at it.

Second, some people may charge a higher rate because they don't want to be
bothered by people who merely want to install wordpress. Taking 5-10 minutes
to install wordpress for someone could cause a busy developer to completely
lose train of thought. I work for a Network Consulting firm and sometimes we
overbid a customer because we don't want the job, we know that those sort of
customers usually end up costing more money than we ultimately get back.

Third, some businesses equate high price with expertise, so there will
always be the high price market out there.

And Fourth, if someone cannot afford to pay the 1500$ or feels like it is a
rip-off, than they will find someone more reasonable. My rate is only 75$/hr
- min 1 hr. Some may say that I am ripping someone off for only doing 5
minutes worth of work and charging for an hours worth.

Just my thoughts on the subject.
Lew

+1 for custom plugins not in the repo not being part of this system
(if it exists). They shouldnt' need a manual upgrade for new versions
unless something breaks.

> Here's what we tell people requesting commercial blogs at  
> install4free:

Here's a sampler from wp-pro mailing list:

- hey i was transford over from  install 4 free they said im more  
commercial web sight http://xyz.com that you guys could help me

- I tried doing a bunch of google-searching, only found one similar  
problem with a guy using FastCGI, which doesn't apply to me.  I tried  
asking the "Install4Free" guys for help, but they said since I have my  
own server I ought to just know how to do this, and directed me here  
instead.

-  Wordpress's Install4Free service told me (very politely, but very  
firmly) that the site was a commercial one and they wouldn't do it for  
me.  Their installer said it's maybe five minutes of work and  
suggested I try here for help.  Cheap help.

I'm just suggesting to explain (again, politely but very firmly) that  
wp-pro is supposed to be a professional list, somewhat different from  
scriptlance or rentacoder, on a different level, because people tend  
to misunderstand this point, and people on wp-pro list aren't really  
happy.

I did not say anything against you or your service, I have really high  
respect for you and your project, but a notable amount of requests  
like that makes your service bad appearing on wp-pro, and this is not  
good for you as well as for us.

Just wondering if you can say (politely, but very firmly) that wp-pro  
isn't properly "a cheap help". I'm just reporting what's happening.

You are not normally interrested in removing the style, but -move- it to the 
head. And since WordPress outputs HTML while looping through all the posts 
that potentially contain galleries, you are fucked if you have not already 
included the style in the head.

I wasn't proposing this as a fix for the issue, just responding to
Viper007Bond's suggestion that Matt might be running a patched version
of trunk and explaining that was far from the only possible cause.

As far as I'm concerned, this kind of styling is really the
responsibility of theme authors, and leaving it to them would make
this a non-issue, but obviously the core devs don't agree. However,
the filter I mentioned does mean that a theme developer can add
gallery styling to their stylesheet and remove the default WP gallery
styling.

I would suggest that the gallery be modified to remove the style
altogether. Why are we including styling elements in the core code
itself? Isn't that up to the theme to decide how a thing looks?

When a theme has to add filters just to get full control over the
style, something is wrong.

subject.

No, I'm sorry, but you keep talking about standards as if that
actually changes anything, when it does not.

If the standards say do to things other than the actual correct way to
do things, then the standards are wrong.

Rules exist only to make you think about it before you break them. If
the rule says to do X but Y makes more sense and prevents more
problems, then you should do Y.

I presume the thought behind it was to make it newbie-friendly and
reduce the number of people saying "Oh no, my images don't look like
they do on Matt's blog! WordPress is broken!" just because their theme
hadn't been updated with styles for the gallery markup. This kind of
issue would have been especially prevalent when 2.5 was first
released, since I imagine the number of theme authors who update their
theme as new features go into trunk is pretty small.

Perhaps include the styles needed as a plugin, installed by default, so then
themes which have been updated can encourage their users to disable the
plugin?

Yeah, that'd probably do the trick.

This is also the main reason I keep my latest release in trunk rather than
having my readme reference a tag version. That way the download button
doesn't reference a specific version number and people who copy/paste the
ZIP URL won't reference an old version.

Would have used edit_post_link() directly, except for the "<a"  
sitting in it's output. str_replace, or the above.

One small change I'd make is not assuming the default is a "post" type. Have
the default case fail (i.e. not a post, page, or attachment by rather
something custom or added in the future).

Thought about it, and decided to steal the logic verbatim from  
edit_post_link() instead, which does have post as a default case. It  
should probably be changed too.

There's no minimum price (or really any guidelines) for posting to the 
list, and I wouldn't be surprised if those people you quote got help 
from someone.

Ideally in the future there's something more structured than a mailing 
list, that was part of the idea behind:

I would highly recommend basing your work on HyperDB. There are a lot of 
little gotchas that you don't find until you're in production.

I don't think replication support is really needed for core, especially 
when we already support drop-in WPDB replacements.

You should wrap it in a conditional -- the link only makes sense on  
single posts or pages.  Thus:

function ueb_add_head_link() {
     if( is_single() || is_page() ) {
         global $post;
         switch ($post->post_type) {
                case 'attachment':
                        return;
                case 'page':
                        if( !current_user_can( 'edit_page', $post- 
 >ID ) ) return;
                        break;
                case 'post':
                default:
                        if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_post', $post- 
 >ID ) ) return;
                        break;
         }

         echo '<link rel="alternate" type="application/x-wiki"  
title="Edit this page" href="' . get_edit_post_link($post->ID) . "\" /> 
\n";
     }
}

Oh, indeed!

Yeah, I hate extra options too and that's a clean solution. Make it a filter
or whatever and themes that want custom CSS can just remove the filter.

I actually don't understand this whole thread. In trunk we have support 
for wp_register_style(), wp_deregister_style(), wp_enqueue_style(), etc. 
working exactly the same way as the similar js functions. Why not use 
them? Something like this should work well:

function register_gallery_css() {
   $url = WP_CONTENT_URL.'/themes/default/gallery.css';
   wp_register_style( 'gallery', $url, array(), '20080619', 'screen' );
}
add_action('init', 'register_gallery_css', 5);

function print_gallery_css() {
   global $wp_styles;
	
   if ( isset($wp_styles) && $wp_styles->query('gallery') )
     wp_print_styles('gallery');
}
add_action('wp_head', 'print_gallery_css');

The gallery.css can be added to the default theme or other appropriate 
place.

Then the themes that have styles for the gallery can do this in the 
functions.php:

function no_gallery_css() {
   wp_deregister_style( 'gallery' );
}
add_action('init', 'no_gallery_css');

Even plugins that want to replace the default gallery.css but only for 
themes that don't have styles for it can do this:

function plugin_gallery_css() {
   $url = ...
   wp_register_style( 'gallery', $url, array(), 'ver', 'screen' );
}
add_action('init', 'plugin_gallery_css', 4);

(it won't be registered second time if the handle already exists).

Also we may need to do something similar for the .alignleft, 
.alignright, .aligncenter css classes too.

It was long, but not entirely pointless. I'll shorten it for you.

1. Coding Standards exist for consistency, even if they are consistency 
wrong.

2. Debating Coding Standards is like debating Politics, what it comes 
down to is a matter of preference.

Matt Mullenweg is the person you should be talking to. Email the guy and 
try to convince him. You might be a better at getting your points 
across, than I was. I'm willing to bet that he won't change the coding 
standard based off of the amount of end users facing this problem. He 
has changed his mind before, so it is possible.

I would explain further, but it might become "pointless", so I'm just 
going to say that if you reply, don't a reply from me explaining the two 
points. You should do research or you should debate the subject with 
Matt. The answer might come to you then.

I will leave with an example. My personal set of coding standards for 
brackets, is that every curly bracket is on its own line. The reason I 
do this is because I've been burned before trying to find the missing 
opening or closing bracket and it is easier for me to just scroll up and 
down and match the two. For WordPress, the opening curly bracket rests 
is not on its own line. I do not apply my person coding standards when I 
write patches for WordPress, I use the WordPress set of Coding 
Standards. Do I always agree, no, but I realize the purpose of Coding 
Standards and do it their way.

I agree with this entirely, which is why I was saying that the
conversation was more than a little pointless. Coding Standards, as
such, have no right or wrong way. Just "the way" as it is defined by
the standard.

But that doesn't mean that the standard must be a rigid unbending
rule. If there's a good reason to break from the standard in a
particular case, then the standard should be broken for that
particular case.

A rule that doesn't bend for circumstances is worthless.

Do we really want to require themes to remove bits just to make it
work properly for themselves? That's my fundamental issue with all of
this, the core code should not be adding styles and other such
visibility things like that.

The gallery should put a simple unordered list of the pictures into
the post, with useful classes like gallery and such. Then it's up to
the themes to style those.

This is a perfectly acceptable way to do things, and themes and users
*will adapt to it*. We can just tell them to copy the gallery stuff
from the default theme's CSS into their own theme's CSS. There should
not be a need for any particular coding associated with this. All that
has to happen is to remove the styles from the gallery code and move
them into the theme's stylesheets. That's it. Finished.

The problem comes with themes which aren't updated regularly; users will
implement the gallery feature and won't have the necessary skills to fix the
stylesheet, and they'll think WP is broken or something. I completely agree
that the core shouldn't be adding any styles, but I think we do need a
fall-back for older themes.

This fall-back should be in the form of a default plugin which adds the
styles for older themes. Newer themes could instruct users to disable the
"Gallery Styles Plugin", or of course the Codex can have ready a piece of
code theme authors could paste into the functions.php file to disable the
plugin if it is installed?

Or, if we don't want the plugin installed by default, when people say on the
support forums that "my gallery doesn't look like Matt's, it's just a list",
forum staff can just direct them to the "Gallery Styles Plugin" to get
things sorted.

Just an idea.

I disagree. Users are generally smarter than you are giving them
credit for. Any person capable of running WordPress on their own site
*will* customize their theme somewhat. Nobody really runs stock
themes.

And if they don't know how to customize their theme to fix the gallery
in particular, then they go searching online, find some forum posts
(the WordPress support forums are extremely well indexed by Google),
and finds somebody saying "insert this chunk of code into your theme's
style.css file" and voila.

This is less of a problem than you're making it out to be. We don't
need full and total backwards compatibility here. We don't have that
for the alignleft/right/center classes, it's not been a big issue. We
never had that for the new tag stuffs either, it's also not been a big
problem. New classes have been added to WordPress in almost every
release, we never had to deal with this before, we don't have to deal
with it now.

Make the default and classic themes work properly, and be done with it.

No. Just put the code into the theme stylesheet. When forum users ask,
we tell them "put this code into the stylesheet". It's a problem we
know how to cope with. Don't make it excessively complicated.
Installing a plugin is harder than copypasting into a theme file.

Doesn't the proxy then become a single point of failure?

WordPress.com does more than 9 billion queries every month through 
HyperDB -- it works. :)

This is a solved problem. If HyperDB is behind on anything, I'd happily 
accept patches.

One thing that would be cool which HyperDB is lacking is replication  
lag detection.  If a database server is down, HyperDB deals with it  
gracefully and goes on to try the next one.  If a slave is lagging  
behind the master, however, HyperDB returns old data to the client.  I  
think MediaWiki's distributed database class deals with this problem,  
but it is the only one AFAIK.

I have two plugins, one is named "Performance Testing" (changed to 
Performance Benchmark Testing), which is conflicting with the "Memory 
Increase" plugin.

This should not happen and I'm not sure what the reason this is 
happening is. It not comforting to have WordPress say it will upgrade 
the plugin for you when you the plugin that will be downloaded is not 
the one you have currently installed.

Is there a reason there would be a naming conflict between the names of 
two plugins?

I've noticed that this happens to me when plugins have the same plugin

keeps trying to have me upgrade thinking that they are one of my

Thanks.

That is fascinating to me, because I had thought that it depended on the 
name. It has been a long time, since I was last informed about the 
plugin updater. If that is the case, then it is not documented and could 
also be a bug. Should ping wp-testers and will do so after I try something.

The plugin updater notification works on a variety of items, It attempts  
to match Plugin Name, Plugin Author, Plugin URL, and also the filename  
(all AFAIK). There isnt really much of a published set of rules which can  
be used, Only a handful of people have seen the code behind it (I'm not  
one, so i'm only going off what i know).
There have been a few times when people have mentioned about the wrong  
plugin being picked up, its allways the plugin URL, I believe it works on  
the plugin URL & Author to determine it when the plugin has been renamed  
for some reason..
I personally allways add a ?plugin=test1 to my generic plugin URL if i do  
not have a published plugin page for it yet.

Subject: [wp-hackers] A theme that adds Pages on install
Message-ID: <62553.208.97.187.133.1214144718.squirrel@mail.mysoutham.com>

Hello,

I'm currently developing a theme that will be used for one specific
purpose, and when it is complete I am hoping to distribute it.

I am interested in the opinion of people on this list as to whether they
see any problem in a theme adding Pages to the database when it is
activated(if that is possible, I haven't yet looked), considering that the
theme will not be used for a conventional blog, and in effect 'needs'
these pages.

Of course, I could always say in the readme, "to make full use of the
features of this theme, please create Pages A, B and C", but why not make
it easier?

Another question I have is whether it is 'right' to sell a theme if it
requires free plugins to use all of the theme's potential features?

Thanks
Alex

A theme is just a visually-oriented plugin, and can do anything that  
a 'normal' plugin can do, including wp_insert_post()'ing Pages. The  
theme's functions.php file is loaded in wp-settings.php, just after  
the plugins, but before the init hook, for every page load. I think  
that the switch_theme action is processed before the theme's  
functions.php is ever loaded, though.

Certainly, consider it work for hire. There may be restrictions (GPL  
compatible?) on the licenses under which you can distribute it, but  
that has no bearing on what you charge for initial development.  
Compare: is it right to sell a theme if it requires (free) Wordpress  
to use the theme at all?

It might be better to add a user-exposed control; 'Click here to add a
special archives page' or somesuch. That way you can add the
functionality you need, but without adding extra pages that the user
might not want.

Subject: [wp-hackers] flickr Short Code Questions
Message-ID: <000001c8d53e$84e57ce0$8eb076a0$@com>

I found some information on a flickr shortcode for including video:

http://faq.wordpress.com/2008/04/22/how-do-i-embed-a-flickr-video/

Is there something similar for slide shows?  I have looked through the
WordPress source code and can't figure out where these short codes are
defined.  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.  I have a bunch of
photo sets on Flickr I want to post on our swim team web site but the only
solution I have found to work so far is the IFRAME tag solution mentioned
here:

http://paulstamatiou.com/2005/11/19/how-to-quickie-embedded-flickr-slideshow
s

The OBJECT tag solution mentioned in the article didn't work.

While I can certainly post using the IFRAME solution myself, I'd like to be
able to give our photographer a simple solution so she can post slide shows
herself.  A short code would do the trick.

Thanks,

Mike

Message-ID: <48604654.2080407@santosj.name>

Just a note for those testing WordPress using PHP 5.3 and using the 
mysqlnd driver for either mysql or mysqli.

You will need to make sure that your authentication for your connection 
username and password is using the 4.1+ or you won't be able to connect. 
Just had this happen to me. Just wanted to let everyone know in case 
they decided to use those in combination.

As an aside, WordPress does not pass certain E_DEPRECATED checks, so you 
may want to turn error_reporting off, unless you are testing. Also, 
since WordPress still supports PHP4, there won't be any fixes for the 
errors, or at least until WordPress sets the requirements to PHP5+.

since WordPress allready sets the error_reporting() isnt it possible for  
WordPress to set it to ignore the E_DEPRECATED errors?

I know that constant will not be defined on older installs, But a simple  
if( ! defined('E_DEPRECATED') ) define('E_DEPRECATED', '0'); should take  
care of that?

Message-ID: <CB6DBD69-D90F-4938-88D1-0B17F876C3CB@striderweb.com>

Can anybody explain the logic of the "comment_form" action hook being  
located _after_ the submit button on the Default Theme?

<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>

This makes _no_ sense to me.  If I want to add something to the  
comment form, I almost certainly want the end user to see it _before_  
they click on "Submit".

I see plugins all the time that jump through hoops to try to relocate  
their additions above the Submit button.  Can anyone think of a good  
example of a plugin that makes good use of the hook after Submit?

It's just puzzling.  To my mind it's a mistake and should be fixed.   
I'm curious what others think.

Even if it's "fixed", it will only affect people who use the default theme
and those who aren't using a modified version (as their version would be
based on an older version of the default theme). Simply put, if you want it
for sure to be before the submit button, have the user edit the template.

Hell, I have plugins that need the wp_head hook to function and I still
commonly get support requests from people asking why it's not working on
their site. You can't rely upon a hook being in the proper spot.

Subscribe To Comments uses the hook, but aborts if the output has already
been done (i.e. manually farther up the page). This is the best solution
IMO.

Oh yeah, and somebody pointed out in a comment on my site that the same 
thing is happening in branches/2.5 ... Cc'ing wp-hackers, since I'm 
seeing it on a more-or-less production version.

I meant to investigate in more detail, but I just haven't had the time.

Subject: [wp-hackers] When HTTP_HOST does not point to the blog
Message-ID: <48613D25.6090007@ohohlfeld.com>

Hi,

I'm using WordPress on an Apache Vhost which -- for some reason I didn't
figure out so far - does not set the correct HTTP_HOST as specified in the
ServerName setting. Thus, requests to $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] will not be
directed to the requested blog.

I noticed this issue when updating WordPress to version 2.3 which caused
an infinite redirection loop due to canonical URLs. When examining the
problem I noticed that some other users experienced the same problem and
this is the main motivation for my post. I'm not sure whether this is an
issue that should be really considered, as this is probably caused by a
misconfiguration of my Apache HTTP server. But maybe it is worth a pointer.

The initial problem with the redirect loop was caused by an HTTP_HOST
environmental setting that does not correspond to the true host name of the
blog. Further analysis showed that also some other parts are affected by
this; the cron functionality can not be accessed and the self link in ATOM
feeds points to a wrong host. I ignored some places where HTTP_HOST is used
in the admin interface so far.

To fix these issues, I mostly changed the host to the one specified in the
configuration:

   $site_url = get_option( ?siteurl? );
   if (strlen($site_url) > 0) {
     $parts = parse_url( $site_url );
     $requested_url .= $parts['host'];
   } else {
     $requested_url .= $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
   }

I briefly described these changes in my blog post, in hope of some other
people experiencing the same problem might find that useful:
http://blog.ohohlfeld.com/2008/06/infinite-301-redirect-loop-in-wordpress-due-to-canonical-urls-fixed/

Regarding the cron, requests are directed to the correct host, as specified
in the configuration ( $argyle = @ fsockopen( $parts['host'], .... ), but
by supplying a wrong HTTP Host attribute. When using name based virtual
hosts, several servers will listen on a single IPs. Requests are distinguished
by the "Host: " attribute supplied in the HTTP header. As
$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] != $parts['host'] in my case, requests will be directed
to a wrong virtual host causing a 404 - file not found (wp-cron.php does not
exist on this particular vhost).
In general, I'm not sure whether it makes sense to establish a connection to
$parts['host'] but then issue an request for HTTP_HOST.

However, these changes fixed the host related issues for me, but I'm not
sure whether this is useful in general...
Would it be useful to add a getBlogHost() procedure whose code might look like
the above mentioned block?

Message-ID: <1869B7C2-252F-4269-A053-EA8B425EFCFC@red-sweater.com>


It recently came to my attention that WordPress is planning to disable  
the XMLRPC and AtomPub based interfaces by default in 2.6.

This decision rubs me the wrong way, and I want to start a dialog here  
to see if others agree (or disagree for that matter!).

My thoughts are, in summary, that this is a short-sighted attempt to  
prevent uncertain security risks, and has negative downsides that will  
affect WordPress users, remote app developers, and even has the  
potential to injure WordPress's reputation as an easy, elegant, and  
secure solution.

I wrote more extensively on my blog:

http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/512/wordpress-to-disable-remote-access

WIthin just a few minutes of writing this post and tweeting about it,  
I received several Twitter replies. Granted, these are people who are  
following me on Twitter and are therefore more likely to agree with  
and be sympathetic with my views. But I think it's worth considering  
the possibility that this is but a small indicator of how the public  
as a whole will react to the change when and if it goes public:

fraserspeirs: @danielpunkass Implies a lack of confidence in their own  
code. Windows-esque.

joemaller: @danielpunkass toggling a setting is easier than fixing the  
codebase. feels weak.

aslakr: @danielpunkass WTF! That seems rather short sighted.

onecrayon: @danielpunkass Screw that! Any way to give negative  
feedback on that change to WordPress?

psionic: @danielpunkass Agree w/Jalkut: not only is disabling  
WordPress's WS by default a step backwards, the web UI should eat its  
own WS dogfood.

I look forward to hearing the thoughts of others on this subject.

Isn't $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] basically data supplied by the browser?
Shouldn't WordPress use $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] instead, which is
data provided by the web server?

Since I run my site on a dedicated IP (for https) I sometimes get
requested without $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] set at all.  I always thought
that was because there simply was no "Host:" header in the request.

They aren't implying, he's inferring.

It's common to disable services that you don't use.  If you have a Linux web
server, you will only open up the services to the outside world that you
actually need.  Don't need FTP? Disable it.  Don't need SSH? Disable it.  I
think that is the thinking here.  Reduce the possible vectors of attack.

I don't know what kind of stats there are about how many people use these
interfaces. Anecdotally, I mentioned this change in an IRC chat and one of
my friends said "huzzah!" This is a friend who has been simply deleting
those interfaces every time he upgrades WordPress, because he has had
security problems in the past (the distant past, in WP terms).

Daniel:
You would be in a far better position to answer the market segment
size question than I, but to me this seems to be a simple question of
audience sizes.

WordPress is an Open Source project and thus, like it or not, the
stuff that gets worked on is the stuff that people /want/ to work on.
Most (decent) XMLRPC clients (like MarsEdit) seem to be on the for-pay
side of the spectrum, which conceptually limits their market share to
those willing to pay for software, thus also limiting the number of
folks able to test any implementation of XMLRPC.

The simple fact of the matter is that the vast majority of WP users
are going to be using the web front end and simply can't be bothered
with the extra care and feeding a remote client requires.  Add the
Gears functionality that is coming and you've even further
down-selected the sample size.  I am willing to bet, though, if you
decided to go the NewsFire/NetNewsWire route and dropped a free (as in
beer) version of MarsEdit tomorrow, you'd see a lot more interest in a
robust implementation of remote access. (We'll leave aside the Leo
Laporte "What's worth money?" question for the time being.)

I agree with Dan Coulter's assessment as well -- if you're not using
the XMLRPC interface, it's probably a great idea to disable it as a
potential point of entry, just as one ought to lock down one's
wp-content/.

I tend to agree. I discovered this yesterday and posted it to FriendFeed
where there were also several negative reactions. Suggest that if it stays
turned off by default (I'm actually okay with this, Expression Engine does
the same thing) that there be some sort of notice in wp-admin (admin_notices
hook?) to alert recent upgraders of this setting. I will certainly cover it
in my 10 Things post too but not everyone reads that and a lot of people are
going to be, like, "WTF?!?!"

Communicate this change effectively.

$_SERVER['HTTP_*'] are populated with HTTP request headers. So if I
include this header:

X-Andy: awesome

you will find:

$_SERVER['HTTP_X_ANDY'] == 'awesome'

WordPress and countless themes and plugins rely on HTTP_HOST. You must
figure out why it is not being set to the value of the HTTP Host
header.

Hi,

Right. I forgot to mention something. Our web servers are not directly
reachable from the outside world and are accessed though an Apache
server running mod_proxy. The proxy will direct the requests to the
right machines and will thus change the HTTP_HOST in the internal
request (from the proxy to the web server)...
This causes the host mismatch. The correct host is supplied in
X-Forwarded-Host, but there is probably a way to solve this Apache
related issue.

Basically, I'm aware that this is a very special issue and I only
posted it as I noticed some other people had similar problems with
canonical URLs. Of course, they may be caused by something different.
Thus, I'm not sure if this issue really needs to be considered, but
I thought it's maybe worth a pointer.

Argh. Never mind. Cancel. Firefox 3 only has half-assed support for this stuff.

>>"The WHATWG draft specification indicates that all requests should come from the offline cache, when available, even if the browser is online. Firefox currently only accesses the offline cache when offline. For that reason, the online whitelist is also not supported yet."

So long as this is documented and part of the 'read this before you 
upgrade' - then it's probably a reasonable change.

There have been a few people bitten in the past few upgrades by not 
reading the readme.. I think the comment on getting a note in the 
dashboard would be nice too.

Also Windows Live Writer uses the xmlrpc interface - that's free; and 
works really well with WP.

Dunno if I'd go that far. Windows Live Writer, ScribeFire, Flock...
All free. Not to mention the dozens of services like YouTube and
Flickr and Digg and such that can post directly to your blog over
XML-RPC.

Perhaps allowing the user to enable it during the upgrade process  
would negate any confusion?

Okay, there is a huge, ***HUGE*** difference between

1) turned off by default on new installs, and

2) silently turning it off on existing installations where it has been  
_on_.

Which are we talking about here?

I have no problem with changing the default for people installing for  
the first time.  I _do_ have an issue with turning it OFF for people  
who previously had it ON.

If we want to undertake a public campaign of recommending that people  
turn it off if they don't use it, that's just fine.  I would even take  
part with my blog.  But if you just turn it off when people aren't  
looking that will mess  up a lot of people who just want things to work.

As for MarsEdit and such, it is probably not too much trouble for them  
to include some sort of notice to check that such and such is set  
within WordPress; but again this should only really happen to people  
doing initial set up.

We do _not_ want a bunch of people upgrading to 2.6 and crying "this  
is broken -- it worked before!!!"  That kind of thing will foster a  
difficult-to-live-down reputation for unreliability.

I just switched a 2.5.1 install to trunk and when I went into my writing
settings and both Atom and XML-RPC are disabled.  I agree that they either
have to be turned on by default for people upgrading or a prominent notice
has to be displayed explaining why things like posting your Flickr photos is
going to break suddenly.

Alexander: Thanks but I was referring to something like
[flickr]37603554@N00/2116110595/[/flickr]
but I guess it's not possible. All the flickr plugins that I've seen so far
make you integrate with your flickr account and import from your
photostreams or something, that's frickin annoying, I just want to frickin
be able to use something like [flickr]someid[/flickr], anyone's picture.
I'll just directly insert it for now.

The problem here is that it did not have any sort of off switch before
now. So either you turn it off or you leave it enabled by default.

Dan, you are completely right.

Security is about minimizing exposure, not the ability to survive an  
attack.

Okay, now this is familiar territory! Since it is an issue with your
configuration, you should put the fix in your customized wp-config.php
file rather than in WordPress. Something like this:

if ( isset( $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST'] ) )
    $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST'];

Of course, HTTP headers should be treated as suspiciously as any
user-supplied input. Take precautions against clients spoofing headers
even if it just means verifying that your proxy won't allow that
header to pass. Maybe you should also ensure that the request came
through the proxy by checking REMOTE_ADDRESS and X_FORWARDED_FOR for
sanity, but here you have the basic solution.

Cheers,
Andy

Embedding images even by URL is supported with a button in TinyMC or  
by inserting an <img /> tag in the body - no shortcode needed.

It's been interesting to see how the general vibe on this list has  
been more supportive of the limitation, while the comments on my blog  
are in both directions but I think with a bit of lean against the  
limitation.

A common argument in favor of the limitation is that it "shuts down  
another vector" that may be a security risk.  I think what Jens Alfke  
said in my blog comments is very pertinent here:

"Some people seem to think there?s something special about XML-RPC  
that makes it inherently less secure. Not so ? It?s just an HTTP POST,  
just like any other change made via the web UI."

When you consider the number of distinct HTTP POST access points into  
a typical WordPress blog, all secured by a cookie-type authentication,  
it makes the SINGLE POINT access via the xmlrpc.php URL seem rather  
easy to manage and to secure, by comparison.

Most (possibly all) of POST calls on the admin side are also secured with a
nonce.

Every XMLRPC interface is secured with a user name and password. At  
least as much as would be required to obtain a "nonce" via the web  
interface, right?

The bottom line is that users are getting into their blogs via the  
web. Using GETS and POSTS, and providing passwords when needed.

It does seem a bit arbitrary to me, to call out these two URLs, the  
ones corresponding to AtomPub and XMLRPC, and treating them as if  
they're in some way more vulnerable to attacks than all the other URLS  
in the blog system.

How true. I have a blog where the there are no comment forms on any 
posts and pages, but somehow the spammers are getting through. The 
problem with securing with nonces is that they can be broken depending 
on how creative the hacker is.

Interestingly enough, I think the nonce system I made has a great track 
record with blocking bots, however the problem is that it sometimes 
blocks actual users as well. I'm paranoid, but I think everything should 
be protected by a nonce (as if most things aren't already). HTTP headers 
can't be trusted and neither can cookies. Hell, you can't even trust 
users and sometimes you can't even trust yourself.

The way they've been more vulnerable in the past has not been checking the  
username/password, but rather, if the user could perform the action AFAIK.
(Eg, A Subscriber signs up, can pass the user login stage, Next is  
checking that the user has all the permissions to do a certain action, In  
the admin section, this is pretty complicated, Then you need to duplicate  
all the security checks in XMLRPC.. etc)

A lot of the XMLRPC/Atompub code has only been looked over by a small  
number of eyes, Most of us do not have a clue about it, dont use it, and  
steer clear of it.. Because of that, Less Developers look at the code, and  
as a result, less chance that a bug will be caught.

If there was the same ammount of active development on both the API and  
use of the API was there is for the main admin panel, I'd say leave it  
enabled by default, But fact is, the API's are used by a rather small  
minority of users, Just as a lot of other functions, The difference here  
however, Is that if the API is *not* going to be used at all by the  
majority, Why leave it enabled when theres a chance something might come  
along and exploit it?

Yes; Theres chances something will come along and exploit the main admin  
panel too, But thats a chance that has to be taken - as the majority of  
users use it.

And IMO, The code needs a good lice comb run through its hair to check for  
any more bugs; Theres a number of code branches in there which seem  
utterly pointless to me, checks being run twice(Just to be sure), and  
quite possibly, some which call admin functions without first checking for  
the *right* permissions; Ie. Its checking for a permission, But there may  
be race conditions where the role manager has assigned a lesser user  
access to that function, Or maybe a user will be granted access to a post

No disrespect meant towards anyone who has done work on the XMLRPC/Atom  
API's, We're all human and may miss something, or type something wrong.

Sorry, dumb question...how do we figure?  Based on people I know, I'd say about half are using blog editors of their choice rather than the fairly-clunky browser interface.

Ok, I admit, That was a huge assumption on my behalf.

4 million downloads of WordPress in 2007, and theres a lot more installs  
of WordPress around the web i'm sure
I personally, without numbers, Doubt a majority of those users use a  
desktop application, Allmost everyone *I* know are avoiding using desktop  
applications if there's a Web-based equivilent, I'd guess that we both  
come from different demographics,

Theres allways going to be a % using offline clients, And theres going to  
be an increased % using Web-based non-WP blogging interfaces, but AFAIK,  
the API's are not currently the primary access method of most of the users.

This is an elegant work-around. Thanks for the hint! Sometimes one

In my opinion, this just means that we need more regression testing, 
especially for XML-RPC. If we had automated regression testing, then 
this would not be a factor.

Implementing something like you want is pretty simple.  What you want is
slightly differently then what I wanted but you may be able to glean
something from what I ended up doing.

I created a post on my Flickr Slideshow shortcode solution here:

This whole discussion reminds me of the REGISTER_GLOBALS default setting
change change in PHP a couple of years ago, when they decided to turn it off
by default.

Simply changing a default for a new installation is not that big a deal.  We
simply need to get the word out about it, and make sure that the upgrade
process does not interfere with existing settings, though maybe a reminder
note on the dashboard about turning it off if you are not using it (or don't
know what it is).

I like the idea of adding the step to decide to the install process as
well.  It will ensure that it gets the attention it needs and minimizes the
"Why doesn't this work!" complaints.

Communication is simply the key here.

Regards,

Jason M.

Yeah, that is somewhat difficult because it really falls under 
acceptance testing. I've heard of a HTTP proxy for PHPUnit, which 
simulates the HTTP environment, but I really think you have to do it 
live over HTTP to be accurate. Generally, if it did do it the functional 
testing way, then it would take forever to run with all of the latency 
of HTTP and having to do it many times. Saver to probably try to get as 
much done with just one HTTP request as possible.

Selenium RC is probably the one you've heard of:

But this is straying a little off-topic.

Here's an idea:
Those with skin in the XML-RPC game ought to put out bounties for
improving the code.  i.e., free Ecto/MarsEdit/etc. licenses for those
with _verified_ found and fixed bugs/flaws/exploits in the WP
implementation.

Also, I cannot imagine that the rumored Automattic iPhone client is
using anything other than XML-RPC... Right?

It is, actually, you just have to use the Flickr API to get the URL of
the picture.

Here's the basic code you'd write.

function flickr_func($atts, $content = null) {
	// $content contains the ID number
	// do the flickr API stuff here to get the photo URL.. you might want
to cache this value somewhere
	return "<img src='PHOTO_URL' />";
}
add_shortcode('flickr', 'flickr_func');

The "flickr API stuff" would be what you find here:

Can we get some stats from the WordPress.com side of things? Not
equivalent, I understand, but at least it would save us from arguing
this point.

Number of posts vs. number of hits to WordPress.com's XML-RPC
interface, or something?

you could as well do that:
[WordPressImager pix="picID" /]
or if you someday want to use more than only one pic:
[WordPressImager pix="picID,pic2ID" /]

(afaik - I didn't work on it lately, as I allready mentioned)

Yes, it does use XML-RPC.

The percentage of posts added to WordPress.com via XML-RPC generally  
fall between 5 to 10 percent a day.  You can review the data at  
http://wordpress.com/stats/posting/ to get specific numbers.

This is pretty interesting, because it puts Automattic into the same  
support conundrum as the rest of the remote clients.

So whether it turns out to be "no big deal" or not, Automattic will  
share in the experience. I like it!

Needless to say, it's quite possible that iPhone access to blogs may  
increase the number of XMLRPC users considerably.

Don't you think the iPhone client would get more adoption if users  
could easily "start using it" without a configuration change?

Oh so it does do it, then again the WordPressImager text is too long so I
might shorten it to flickr myself (As that's the only thing I'll use
anyways). Thanks Mike Walsh, Otto, and Alexander Beutl, that should help.
I'm going to try and find a way (Perhaps in the Flickr API, though I can
also take a look at the photo dropper plugin) of choosing the size,
something like [flickr size="small"]theid[/flickr]. Thanks again guys.

I along with 2 other people wrote an iPhone interface a while back, but it
hasn't led to widespread adoption:

I disagree.  I don't think there is any reason to draw the line here.  Old
blogs can get grandfathered in having it turned on during the upgrade
process. New blogs have it turned on by default.  Don't bother putting in a
checkbox or anything in the upgrade process. When CrazyHorse comes out an
announcement can be added to the inbox that says "You have this on. If you
don't use it, turn it off." The blogger reads it, dismisses it and takes
action if they want to.  If the inbox implementation allows, it can have an
"Address this issue" link that connect to the page with the check box on it.

1. New blogs are safe

2. No one loses features

3. Bloggers are made aware of how to increase the security of their blog.

All concerns have been addressed.  Yes?

Subject: [wp-hackers] NextGen Photo Album Plugin Patch
Message-ID: <20080626153834.rgcc731dfk0kcocc@www.dimensionmedia.com>

I am working on a patch for NextGen album plugin on behalf of a client.

As part of the project, I added this function to the plugin

// TRR - NEW function - adds a new gallery to the default album (i.e  
the lowest Numbered
album)
function addToDefaultAlbum ($galleryid){
         global $wpdb, $ngg_options;

         list ($firstAlbum,$sortorder) = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT  
id,sortorder FROM
$wpdb->nggalbum ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1");
         $sort_array = unserialize($sortorder);
// if something went wrong, initialize to empty array
         if (!is_array($sort_array)) $sort_array = array();
// Adding first Gallery to end of the array
         $sort_array[] = $galleryid;

// Put it back where you found it
         $sortorder = serialize($sort_array);
         //$result = $wpdb->query(" UPDATE $wpdb->nggalbum SET  
sortorder = '0' WHERE id =
$firstAlbum ");
         return;
}
// TRR - END


If I uncomment the wpdb->query at the end of the function, the plugin  
dies during
activation complaining that a function in the same file (using an INIT  
callback) has been
previously declared. Specifically - Fatal error: Cannot redeclare  
nggallery_init()
(previously declared in
/sites/wptest/wp-content/plugins/nextgen-gallery/nggallery.php:121) in
/sites/wptest/wp-content/plugins/nextgen-gallery/nggallery.php on line 122

If I were doing an include or causing some recursion in my code - I'd  
figure that out.
But I can toggle the error by uncommenting this line.

Any insight (or brickbats) would greatly be appreciated.

A significant factor is the way your article frames the issue and
excites people. There are numerous problems with your analogies and
comparisons, but that is off topic here.

I think your concern is a valid one, and I value a good protest. Still
there is no "WordPress's decision". It's the thousands of WordPress
participants, particularly the regular contributors in the remote
access area including yourself. "A real solution" is ultimately
offered through code.

Still I'd like to do a little talky to, as I'm also intriged by this
change. I wonder if it is something that will last many versions, and
might end up being short sited (pun intended). I'm surprised the
discussion has been so focused on traditional clients. Publishing from
other social tools and sites into WP is increasing popular -- upload
your video to service X and publish to your blog; go out for coffee
and let the world know.

It seems like an OAuth or like solution is desirable, or soon will be.
Then again on wp-xmlrc, people didn't seem excited about
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-xmlrpc/2008-June/000208.html
Assuming OAuth does get hawt, what addition benefits and protections
does disabling provide if you also have OAuth? The extra hoop the 1st
time would seem to add little benefit if OAuth is always the first
gate. Of course, it might be a tough pill to swallow because it would
really break all existing clients.

Thanks,
Lloyd

Hi,

The "Platinum SEO Pack" plugin [1] has copied large portions of the  
code in my robots meta plugin [2] without proper attribution, and  
without notifying me. That's a direct violation of the GPL, and as  
such I'd like to know who to contact to have the plugin removed from  
the repository until it's author decides to attribute it correctly.

Best,

Which sections of the GPL forbid 1) copying without attribution and 2)
not notifying the original developer?

The original author of the code holds the copyright, and the GPL states that
you must maintain the copyright notices of the code that you use.

Thanks Dan!

So we agree on that, could someone help me out by telling me where I  
have to go with this complaint? :)

I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, just (apparently) ignorant:
which are the lines that forbid 1) copying without attribution and 2)
not notifying the original developer?

In the sections Alex King points to, I see requirements that the
derived work must maintain license compatibility with the GPL, which
this ripoff plugin has done explicitly.

The closest thing I can find to that is that one must "keep intact all
the notices that refer to this License," which isn't quite the same,
and is obeyed by the ripoff in invoking the GPL.  Could you quote the
section you had in mind?

It's also worth pointing out that there are no notices of copyright in
Joost de Valk's code available at
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/robots-meta/, so even if your
interpretation is correct the ripoff has nothing to maintain.

Is he hosting the download on his site?  If so, contact him with a  
cease and desist.  If he ignores it, send it to his hosting

At first, my thought was "get over yourself". So they based theirs on yours.
Big deal.

That was before a look through the two codebases.

It was a direct lift with no changes at all for that section.

It is only a portion of the whole, but it is bad form. Attribution and
discussion with your should have been part of their path.

I don't think there is much you can do about it over what you have done.
Public embarrassment and scorn works pretty well.

You might add a line to your readme file to further highlight the GPL, but
other than that, I don't know that there is much recourse.

Exactly, I'm quite fine with them making a better / more complete  
plugin, that's why I released it under the GPL in the first place and  
uploaded it to wordpress.org. I only want them to attribute it  
correctly.

At first, my thought was "get over yourself".

At second, my thought is "get over yourself". You publish things on
the intarwebs. They are copied. End of the story.

hehe I understand your feeling Ozh, but it's not that simple :) That's  
why we HAVE the GPL in the first place.

Yes.

Most coders are pedants of the first order, and LOVE such minutia.

It is more a question of "community standards". What are the societal norms
for this little coding community that makes widgets. We have people coming
from intense coding backgrounds. We have open source enthusiasts. We have
novice coders making tweaks to existing code, and saying proudly "Look what
I did!". There are pros making a living off this stuff, and amateurs
contributing for the global good.

There are going to be lots of these talks. And like anything web related,
every September they will start over.

With regard to your first point, based on GPLv3, Section 5 (a): "The work
must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a
relevant date." This fact, in combination with the fact that the original
creator of the work retains the actual copyright leads me to believe that
the copying must include attribution.

With regard to your second point, I do not believe the original developer
has to be notified.

This may be a moot point. I don't know about the Netherlands, but in the
United States, copyright is automatically granted with or without a
"copyright" sentence. In short, de Valk's claims of infringement could
actually bolstered by the lack of GPL inclusion because he should still
retain all rights to his work.

However, I think that since it's a requirement that all work posted on on
wp-plugins.org has to be licensed under GPL or GPL-compatable, de Valk's
code does have a de facto GPL license attached to it.

de Valk's best bet might be to send a nice email to the wordpress.org folk
and state his case and if that doesn't work, send a DMCA takedown notice
(yea, ick I know).

Thanks Andrew,

now, might I propose making this into a page on the plugin directory  
immediately, with some more explanation, with the intent of trying to  
prevent Ozh from going mad when someone else has the same problem and  
starts emailing? We need him to code :)

Cheers,
Joost

Interesting points from Austin. Just out of curiosity and for my own
education, I'm interested in specific thoughts on the following
aspects:

1. It's my understanding that the GPL carries / implies NO requirement
for attribution in derivative works (as Austin mentions), so I'm
unclear as to what the allegation is as it relates to that.

2. The closest thing that *might* apply would be the section that
references ""keeping intact all the notices that refer to this
License,", so that if the source contained an original reference to
the license, written by the original author, subsequent copiers may be
obliged to keep that. However, I just downloaded the robots-meta
plugin, and can find no such references for anyone to "keep intact",
so I think you're out of luck there as well.

Granted, it's a crappy thing to do, and giving attribution would
certainly be the *RIGHT* thing to do, and any considerate developer
should do it, especially in a case of exact copying like this.

The problem is that I don't think there's any technical violation of
the GPL or anything else here; just a breach of etiquette. I think you
might need a bit more than that before you start talking about
take-down notices, etc.

All the code that de Valk writes is under his copyright purview. He still
owns it, but it letting other people use it.

Yes, and by releasing it under the GPL, he has already "let" everyone
else use it under terms that do not require those people to give
attribution, AFAICT.

PS - Andrew, I missed your initial quote from the GPLv3, but I don't
know if you can necessarily apply that, since this plugin does not
directly reference the GPL v3. WP is under GPL v2 (IIRC), and I don't
think there is any implication that plugins in the repo are
automatically v3 if not otherwise stated. Be happy to see something
that indicates otherwise, though.

I should probably clarify that I'm in NO WAY associated with either
party in this, nor am I defending the behavior. Just wanted to make
sure people weren't getting all worked up (talking about DMCA
takedowns, etc.) when the "violation" may not actually hold water,
outside of common courtesy.

While we do not agree on the violation, I'm certainly not planning any  
DMCA's :P

I just think they people / person who did this is an *&^*-hole, and am  
trying to see the scope of what I could do about it :)

Cheers,
Joost

Here's my final thought: at the very least, the originator of the work must
be legally know in case questions he/she must be contacted for whatever
reason. In short, attribution is given by ensure that a trail of contributor
names are left.

GPLv2 is essentially the same. Section 2(a): "You must cause the modified
files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the
date of any change."

The facts are fairly simple but often missed.

In order to enforce the GPL someone has to own the copyright in the 'program'.
They should declare their copyright in the 'program'  source files,
and include a copy of the licence.

Anyone who distributes a modified version or a new work derived from
it is *required* to include their copyright notices and a copy of the
license.

Here are the relevant FAQs.

That much we can definitely agree on :-)

I do think it can be interesting to explore these issues too; just
hoping no one gets their blood pressure up to high over it...

Mike,

while I do not include a GPL, the GPL is implicit due to my uploading  
it to wordpress.org (I'll make sure a next version does carry a GPL  
btw), if he did not think of it that way, he's breaking "normal"  
copyright, which would allow me to take out his entire website with a  
DMCA notice (still not planning on that :) ).

And damn it, all I want is credit, nothing more, nothing less :)

Cheers,
Joost

And let's not forget that leaving the GPL out might actually restrict
others even more. i.e. The default position in copyright law is that
others can't copy your stuff, with or without attribution.

This does get a little murky since you uploaded it, which could be
construed as an implicit granting of your code to the public domain---but
I really, really doubt that argument would fly in court.

Hm... Now that I think about it, you could really nail this guy for taking
away your right to control who gets to modify your code. By GPL'ing it he
is telling others they have the right to modify it under the GPL when they
don't.

David

Aren't both of these plugins in the WP directory? If so, I can't help
but wonder if this could be resolved more easily by getting these two
authors in touch with each other and sorting things out. "Hey, could
you give me attribution on that?" "Yeah, sure; sorry about that".

Much easier and less drama. Realistically, no one is ever going to get
"nailed" (legally, at least) over this issue, because it would be way
too expensive to try to take to court for little or no resulting
damages (in the monetary sense) at the end.

Can't we all just get along? :-)

Message-ID: <93c3fbd10806272333l3bc66c02m60f6e426add8e62f@mail.gmail.com>

I'm thinking that, 1) since wordpress.org requires q GPL compatible (key
word: compatible) license, 2) no copyright notice was included to indicate
who owned the copyright, or what license was used, 3) GPL requires licensed
product to include GPL copyright notice as well as requiring qnyone using
GPL'd code to include the copyright licenses that were inncluded in all code
sources before the modifications (in this case none)...

I'm having a hard time seeing how this can be considered a GPL covered
plugin. If I looked at it I would assume that it was in fact released in the
public domain simply from the lack of copyright notice and the fact that it
was uploaded to a site that requires GPL compatability. I would assume that
anything not defining a propper liscence on such a site was public domain,
and I would hope that if that assumption were wrong that the author would at
least contact me to explain the oversight of forgetting the copyright
license in the original file and give me a chance to continue their efforts
in correcting that oversight by propperly including the licensing and
copyright information that they had somehow forgotten.

If I were the original copyright holder and I made such a mistake I would
greatly prefer to keep that on a level that would not involve making all
parties look like degenerate fools...

But that's just me, I am not a lawyer, and I certainly don't know what all
the possible licenses that can be uploaded to wordpress.org require, I
suppose it is posible that there are others, besides public domain, that may
not require a copyright or liscensing notice. I wish everyone involved the
best of luck untangling this twisted licensing mess and I am very gratefull
that I am not a part of it.

Sincerly.

I've tried. He just emailed me back and says he DIDN't copy any of my  
plugin. Now I'm sorry, but everybody who's seen that plugin's code  
knows it isn't true.

Joost,

I don't think uploading to wordpress.org does not imply GPL.  I've
uploaded a number of things to wordpress.org under the BSD license.

It is always best to explicitly declare the copyright and the license
in any code you make available to others.

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

Ok I have resolved it with the developer, he'll be attributing  
correctly and I'll be helping him to further improve the plugin, in  
true GPL style :)

I still think it would be good to put some of the discussion on this  
subject into a page on wordpress.org :)

Best,
Joost

Indeed. Made a start for it.

I know it's not Twitter, but there is a WordPress Development Mugshot
group that I created a long time ago:

http://mugshot.org/group?who=npFL0SSbsg9X5Z

If you add yourself to that group, and install the Mugshot desktop
client (Winders and Linnix, no Maccas), you'll get popups of SVN commits
on your desktop.

Point taken. I wasn't trying to be particularly exciting, but I guess  
I do have strong feelings.  Mostly I just wanted to get the thoughts  
into the atmosphere, and it looks like I've succeeded if at the cost  
of possibly offending some people with my style. I acknowledge that  
the metaphors, especially of the bank/ATMs, have some major flaws.

Good points. However, you have to agree that policy decisions are made  
in deciding which code gets integrated and which doesn't. For  
instance, my offering a "make sure XMLRPC support is enabled" patch  
isn't going to get me anywhere :) A subset of WordPress contributors  
do ultimately make decisions, and I think it makes senes at least  
conversationally to call those decisions "WordPress's".

I think you're right that more talk should be done about the varied  
(and increasing!) uses for the remote APIs.  Many people seem to be  
dismissing the disabling as insignificant because of the relatively  
small number of people who are using dedicated desktop clients. But  
it's a great point and worth considering how many "mash-up" type  
plugins and services will not work unless the interfaces are enabled.

Good point. The major breakage would probably be undesirable enough  
that it would have to be an opt-in. But I guess we have to start  
somewhere!

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the matter,

Daniel

I think because when you click on it, it selects the <input>... Not
really 100% sure though.

It's reasonably common practice for <label>s to have a pointer cursor.
Not sure if any of the browsers display this by default though?...

FWIW, a plugin could easily change that setting (or any other WP setting)
when activated.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Possible optimizations to rss_enclosures and
	atom_enclosures
Message-ID: <48672995.2070406@santosj.name>

Before I create a ticket I want to confirm that there isn't something 
I'm missing with the code. I'm not sure if this is intentional and there 
is something that I'm missing. However, with what I know, it seems like 
it can be improved.

{{{
foreach (get_post_custom() as $key => $val) {
        if ($key == 'enclosure') {
            foreach ((array)$val as $enc) {
                $enclosure = split("\n", $enc);
                echo apply_filters('atom_enclosure', '<link href="' . 
trim(htmlspecialchars($enclosure[0])) . '" rel="enclosure" length="' . 
trim($enclosure[1]) . '" type="' . trim($enclosure[2]) . '" />' . "\n");
            }
        }
    }
}}}

Can be reduced to

{{{
$metadata = get_post_custom();

    if( isset($metadata['enclosure']) ) {
        foreach( (array) $metadata['enclosure'] as $enc ) {
            $enclosure = split("\n", $enc);
            echo apply_filters('atom_enclosure', '<link href="' . 
trim(htmlspecialchars($enclosure[0])) . '" rel="enclosure" length="' . 
trim($enclosure[1]) . '" type="' . trim($enclosure[2]) . '" />' . "\n");
        }
    }
}}}

or even:
{{{
$metadata = get_post_custom();

foreach( (array) $metadata['enclosure'] as $enc ) {
    $enclosure = split("\n", $enc);
    echo apply_filters('atom_enclosure', '<link href="' . 
trim(htmlspecialchars($enclosure[0])) . '" rel="enclosure" length="' . 
trim($enclosure[1]) . '" type="' . trim($enclosure[2]) . '" />' . "\n");
}
}}}

Depending on the amount of the post metadata, looping through all of the 
metadata when it is not needed doesn't seem efficient and could become 
very slow on systems which have posts with a lot of metadata.

Both rss_enclosures and atom_enclosures are this way.
