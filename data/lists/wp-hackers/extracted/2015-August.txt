Subject: [wp-hackers] TinyMCE 4.2 with Image-edit
Message-ID: <CAFnKAk31YkKctSHP4Cc2-pjkAqqqOCGjzdCq-PmGiH-+rsBuzg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I see there are a good number of changes in Wordpress 4.3, and one seems
particularly interesting - The latest new version of TinyMCE installed now
has its own image editor:
http://blog.tinymce.com/2015/06/25/tinymce-4-2-with-image-tools/

I'm curious what the long-term plan is for this, since there has been a
basic image editor in Wordpress for media items for some time. Do you think
it could be replaced with MCE's eventually? Or will MCE's editor be
ignored/removed in 4.3 or another soon release?

Best regards,
Luke

Subject: [wp-hackers] The OAuth2 Complete plugin for WordPress uses a
	pseudorandom number generator which is non-cryptographically
	secure (WordPress plugin)
Message-ID: <fb36f9943f674f3981e163021d03cd8c@security.dxw.com>

Details
================
Software: OAuth2 Complete For WordPress
Version: 3.1.3
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/oauth2-provider/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/the-oauth2-complete-plugin-for-wordpress-uses-a-pseudorandom-number-generator-which-is-non-cryptographically-secure/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 10 (High; AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Description
================
The OAuth2 Complete plugin for WordPress uses a pseudorandom number generator which is non-cryptographically secure

Vulnerability
================
The following refer to the generateAccessToken() function in library/OAuth2/ResponseType/AccessToken.php, and?the?generateAuthorizationCode() function in library/OAuth2/ResponseType/AuthorizationCode.php.

These functions attempt to generate secure auth tokens, but do not use the WordPress random number generator. Instead they use a series of fallback calculations depending on which PHP version is being used. Some?of these calculations?are not crypographically secure:
The first is mcrypt_create_iv(100, MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM). MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM is expected to change to a different random value whenever it is called, but on Windows, on older versions of php it is known to be a constant value
if no other functions (e.g. /dev/urandom) are?available then the access token is generated solely using mt_rand(), microtime(), and uniqid().
mt_rand() (Mersenne twister) is not a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
According to the documentation mt_rand() is also biassed towards even return values in some circumstances.
According to the documentation uniqid() is as secure a PRNG as microtime().


Proof of concept
================
See the documentation:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.uniqid.php
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mt-rand.php

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 3.1.5 or later.
If this is not possible then ensure that you are using a recent version of php (at least 5.3), or?disable the plugin.

Message-ID: <37107D5B-95BA-4EF0-88AB-13FFA07949C7@cogeco.ca>

is the include_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/feed.php' ); 

needed when using fetch_feed inside a plugin?

i see its loaded in wp-settings.php, on the codex page in the example it shows the include, curious if i need it.
