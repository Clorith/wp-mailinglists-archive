Of course when its open source then anyone can work on it.
But this will also require some support from the Wordpress community like
feedbacks on my
UIs and code and slight help sometimes.
Also as Eric said, are the efforts towards this app welcome?
If  the community gives heads up, then i would like to start some time
after GSOC ends.


Best.

Rejoice: PHP 5.3 is, at last, on the threshold of overtaking PHP 5.2 as 
the most common version that WordPress is being run on...

http://wordpress.org/about/stats/

... just in time for the PHP 5.3 end-of-life! 
http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&m=140605526629324&w=2 (though for 
many, there will continue to be security patches for several more years, 
since PHP 5.3 was part of RHEL 5 and hence Cent OS 5).

 From the end of this month, around 21.5% of WordPress installations 
will be running on non-EOL-ed PHP versions.

Best wishes,
David

Message-ID: <53E1FA7C.5070405@wordshell.net>

This isn't specifically a WP issue, but I think it will be relevant to 
lots of us, trying to maximise our resources...

Issue: I find that a disproportionate amount of server resources are 
consumed by a certain subset crawlers/robots which contribute nothing. 
I'd like to just block them. I have in mind the various semi-private 
search engines run by SEO companies/backlink-checkers, e.g. 
http://en.seokicks.de/, https://ahrefs.com/. These things happily spider 
a few thousand pages, every author, tag, category, etc., archive. Some 
of them refuse to obey robots.txt (the one that specifically annoys is 
when they ignore the Crawl-Delay directive. I even came across one that 
proudly had a section on its website explaining that robots.txt was a 
stupid idea, so they always ignored it!).

I'd like to just block such crawlers. So: does anyone know of where a 
reliable list of the IP addresses used by these services is kept? 
Specifically, I want to block the semi-private or obscure crawlers that 
do nothing useful for my sites. I don't want to block mainstream search 
engines, of course. I've done some Googling, and haven't managed to find 
something that makes this distinction.

Or alternatively - anyone think this is a bad idea?

Depending on the web server software you are using you can look at using the htaccess file and block users/bot based on their user agent.

This article should help:

http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess13.shtml

Alternatively do drop me a line if you would like a hand with this as we manage the hosting for a number of WordPress blogs/websites.


Cheers
John

At first this looks potentially useful - since it is in a 
machine-readable format, and can be parsed to find a list of bots that 
match specified criteria.... but on a second glance, it looks not so 
useful. I searched for 3 of the recent bots I've seen most regularly in 
my logs: SEOKicks, AHrefs, Majestic12 - and it doesn't have any of them.

The issue's not about how to write blocklist rules; it's about having a 
reliable, maintained, categorised list of bots such that it's easy to 
automate the blocklist. Turning the list into .htaccess rules is the 
easy bit; what I want to avoid is having to spend long churning through 
log files to obtain the source data, because it feels very much like 
something there 'ought' to be pre-existing data out there for, given how 
many watts the world's servers must be wasting on such bots.

Best wishes,
David

The best answer is the htaccess-based blacklists from PerishablePress. I
think this is the latest one:

http://perishablepress.com/5g-blacklist-2013/

He uses a mix of blocked user agents, blocked IP's and blocked requests
(i.e /admin.php, intrusion scans for other software). He's been updating it
for years and it's definitely a WP-centric project.

In the past some good stuff has been blocked by his lists (Facebook spider
blocked because it had an empty user agent, common spiders used by
academics were blocked) but that's bound to happen and I'm sure every UA
was used by a spammer at some point.

I run a ton of sites on my server so I hate the .htaccess format (which is
a pain to implement alongside wp+super cache rules). If I used multisite it
would be less of a big deal. Either way, know that you can block UA's for
all virtual hosts if that's relevant.

Note that ip blocking is a lot more effective at the server level because
blocking with Apache still uses a ton of resources (but at least no MySQL
etc). On Linux an iptables based block is much more effective.

Set up a trap. A link hidden by CSS on each page that if hit, the IP gets
blacklisted for a period of time. No human will ever come across the link
unless they're digging. No bot actually renders the entire page out before
deciding what to use.

Almost forgot, the link should be in a subdirectory that is marked in
robots.txt to ignore, so anything ignoring robots.txt is whats hit.

I like to use a nice tool from http://www.spambotsecurity.com/ but it
may cause more issues for some people though. Best thing is that it
very fast and dowsn't slow down unlike .htaccess

It also works for forms, in addition to a captcha have a hidden form and
anything touching that input gets denied :)

Nice! I'm looking forward to giving that a try. Thanks again for sharing tips!

This looks like an interesting list, but doesn't fit the use case. The 
proprietor says "the 5G Blacklist helps reduce the number of malicious 
URL requests that hit your website" - and reading the list confirms 
that's what he's aiming for. I'm aiming to block non-malicious actors 
who are running their own private search engines - i.e. those who want 
to spider the web as part of creating their own non-public products 
(e.g. databases of SEO back-links). It's not about site security; it's 
about not being spidered each day by search engines that Joe Public will 
never use. If you have a shared server used to host many sites for your 
managed clients, then this quickly adds up.

At the moment the best solution I have is adding a robots.txt to every 
site with "Crawl-delay: 15" in it, to slow down the rate of compliant 
bots and spread the load around a bit.

Best wishes,
David

Message-ID: <CAOwx47ee4KD2n7bCtreg4hxA=p5-rCJzuVo716Xau2225Ujhng@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I was working with a client that was using the Fundify WordPress theme,
which was powered by a combination of Fundify Crowdfunding(
https://wordpress.org/plugins/appthemer-crowdfunding/ ) and EDD.

I wanted to download the source of the plugin to my computer to easily
navigate through the codebase. On the plugin page they've added "(Moved)"
to the name of the plugin.
Once I extracted the archive, there was nothing but an empty .php file and
a readme.txt file.

My question in this case is - is this allowed and isn't that a terrible way
of discontinuing a plugin? What if someone updates the plugin and their
site stops working? Or someone installs the plugin and nothing happens...

Is there anything the WordPress.org plugins team can do about it?

Best regards,
Nikola

Yes, that is a terrible way to discontinue a plugin, but people do it
anyway. When we find them, we close them so that listing is removed.

I'm aware that I can download the previous versions of the plugin(well most
users are probably not though), but the thing is that you shouldn't have to
do that.

Otto - I guess it's probably more headaches than it's worth, but what about
reverting the last commit(or just moving the code back to /trunk or the
stable tag) and changing the readme to state that the plugin is no longer
going to be supported.
You then revoke access to the plugin's repository(so that the authors can
no longer do the same thing).

Ultimately I think that if there's a list of plugins that are no longer
supported by their authors and are put up "for adoption" by other
developers everyone could benefit(not sure if that's fair/possible?). Yes,
you can just fork the plugin and upload it as a new one, but the users of
the old plugin probably won't be aware that there's a new version of the
plugin.

Anyway, just some thoughts.

Well, it is their plugin. If they don't want to support it or have people
download it anymore, then I have no real problem with that. So removing the
listing is the best way to do that, as I see it. I don't think we should
revert it and force it to be available if they don't want it available
anymore.

If somebody wants to remove their own plugin from the listings, then we can
do that. Simply nulling it out and putting "moved" on it is a bad idea, but
just getting rid of the URL entirely is fine with me.

Among the reasons we don?t keep an official list of ?plugins ready for adoption? is that the plugin team doesn?t have the time, and any attempt to use a wiki would be easy to mess up by people listing plugins that are not ready to be taken over.

I say this a lot. If YOU have a plugin you want to stop working on, push an update that makes it clear on the plugin settings page, the plugin listing on the plugins.php page, AND in your readme for the wporg repo. Tell people ?I?m not working on this anymore.? and if you?re inclined, give them a way to contact you to take it over.

Because y?know :) We?re cool with that!

Also remember we generally aren?t going to hand over your plugin to random people.

https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2014/02/06/clarification-on-taking-over-plugins/

So keep your email address on WPORG valid and up to date, and do please whitelist plugins AT wordpress.org :D

## Chris replied, on Aug 8 @ 11:15am (AMT):

the issue is that there are a lot, probably thousands of users running
that plugin and by pushing an update that nulls it those site owners
are losing real money in a very big way. If they didn't want to
support it use the adopt me tag or something. The problem with
removing it from the listings IMO is that those users who we're
running it live need to have a way of getting the previous version
zip, and for most users the easiest way (other than reverting the
update) would e to grab the last version zip off the dev tab on the
listing.

Well, it is their plugin. If they don't want to support it or have
people
 download it anymore, then I have no real problem with that. So
removing the
 listing is the best way to do that, as I see it. I don't think we
should
 revert it and force it to be available if they don't want it
available
 anymore.

 If somebody wants to remove their own plugin from the listings, then
we can
 do that. Simply nulling it out and putting "moved" on it is a bad
idea, but
 just getting rid of the URL entirely is fine with me.

I'm aware that I can download the previous versions of the plugin(well
most
 users are probably not though), but the thing is that you shouldn't
have to
 do that.

 Otto - I guess it's probably more headaches than it's worth, but what
about
 reverting the last commit(or just moving the code back to /trunk or
the
 stable tag) and changing the readme to state that the plugin is no
longer
 going to be supported.
 You then revoke access to the plugin's repository(so that the authors
can
 no longer do the same thing).

 Ultimately I think that if there's a list of plugins that are no
longer
 supported by their authors and are put up "for adoption" by other
 developers everyone could benefit(not sure if that's fair/possible?).
Yes,
 you can just fork the plugin and upload it as a new one, but the
users of
 the old plugin probably won't be aware that there's a new version of
the
 plugin.

 Anyway, just some thoughts.

LOL. Honestly, every time the issue of adoption comes up for plugins, I
can't help but laugh a bit. :)

Plugin adoption is not a real issue, because there is nobody out there
actually wanting to adopt other people's code.

Seriously, nobody wants to do it. People keep asking why there is no
"for-adoption" list, and the answer is simply because it is not necessary.
There's no shortage of abandoned plugins, but there's a serious shortage of
caring wanna-be-parents for those plugins.

I can think of maybe 10 times that a plugin has been adopted. Total. Ever.
It just doesn't come up that often. The whole thing is a total non-issue
because the truth of the matter is that no coder really wants to take over
somebody else's code. It's a lot more fun to write your own code instead.
And when you're doing things for free, "fun" is your primary purpose.

If anybody wants to adopt a plugin and cannot get in touch with the author,
you can email the plugins team and they will facilitate the process or make
contact or whatever. But this virtually never happens. There's no need for
a list because it's not like we're swamped with requests or anything.

It depends on the plugin. Given the one in question was used by a lot
of people and is a mandatory plugin for several themes not written by
that developer there would probably be a very high chance this one
would be adopted if allowed

support it use the adopt me tag or something. The problem with
removing it from the listings IMO is that those users who we're
running it live need to have a way of getting the previous version
zip, and for most users the easiest way (other than reverting the
update) would e to grab the last version zip off the dev tab on the
listing.

Among the reasons we don?t keep an official list of ?plugins ready
for adoption? is that the plugin team doesn?t have the time, and
any attempt to use a wiki would be easy to mess up by people listing
plugins that are not ready to be taken over.

 I say this a lot. If YOU have a plugin you want to stop working on,
push an update that makes it clear on the plugin settings page, the
plugin listing on the plugins.php page, AND in your readme for the
wporg repo. Tell people ?I?m not working on this anymore.? and
if you?re inclined, give them a way to contact you to take it over.

 Because y?know :) We?re cool with that!

 Also remember we generally aren?t going to hand over your plugin to
random people.

 So keep your email address on WPORG valid and up to date, and do
please whitelist plugins AT wordpress.org :D

Well, it is their plugin. If they don't want to support it or have
people
 download it anymore, then I have no real problem with that. So
removing the
 listing is the best way to do that, as I see it. I don't think we
should
 revert it and force it to be available if they don't want it
available
 anymore.

 If somebody wants to remove their own plugin from the listings, then
we can
 do that. Simply nulling it out and putting "moved" on it is a bad
idea, but
 just getting rid of the URL entirely is fine with me.

I have "adopted" three Plugins (one of which - thankfully - the primary
development was taken back over by the original developer). But what Otto
said is entirely correct: if someone wants to adopt a Plugin, just contact
the developer. From there, it's a simple matter of the developer entering
your WPORG username in the correct field on the Plugin's Admin page in the
Plugin Directory.

On a related note: I forked a Plugin a long time ago, and eventually, that
Plugin's functionality was entirely superseded by core functionality. The
Plugin had tens of thousands of downloads, so I couldn't simply stop
maintaining it, or blanking out the latest version in SVN. Instead, I added
information to the readme.txt explaining why the Plugin's functionality was
no longer necessary, then in a later version, I gracefully backed out the
Plugin's hooks, then in a much later version, removed the no-longer-hooked
Plugin functions:

http://wordpress.org/plugins/cbnet-ping-optimizer/

I had thought about asking the Plugin team to remove it, but since I still
see quite a bit of misinformation about the Plugin's necessity from time to
time, it seems to be more beneficial to leave it as-is.

So, that might be an approach worth taking for the OP's Plugin.

As a reminder, if we ?remove? your plugin, it just means not?s not going to be listed in WPORG anymore. You can still check in SVN code and all that. So in this case, Chip, closing the plugin would prevent anyone new from using it, while leaving your support forum intact. I?d probably do that since it?s not needed anymore.

Just ping us at plugins AT wordpress.org and let us know :)

(There?s also a way to disable the plugin, so you can push updates while not allowing new people to download, which is also a good idea to do WHILE you?re backing it out)

Tons of great information on the subject - thanks everyone!

Otto - it's true that usually no one likes working on other people's
code(yuk!), but Chris is right I think - this is a pretty popular plugin
and I'm assuming there would have been someone interested in adopting the
plugin.

Hi,

For those of you looking for the Crowdfunding plugin sourcecode. I added 
this to my Github repos a few months back. The last commit from the 
original repo was from 23rd april. If anyone has a newer version, let me 
know, but for now you'll at least have access to the sourcecode.

https://github.com/BjornW/crowdfunding

ps: I'm not planning to maintain this plugin, just sharing it as a 
courtesy to fellow developers.

Revisionary (http://wordpress.org/plugins/revisionary/) is one such plugin
that looks to provide what you need.  Note: it hasn't been updated
recently, so make sure to test thoroughly.

I'm sure there are other plugins with similar functionality.

Hi Mike,

I had already stumbled upon Revisionary, indeed. But, as you noted, it 
hasn't been updated in a while. I was wondering if this is something 
that could be considered as a core feature to enhance the revision 
system already available in WordPress. Basically a way to edit a 
"future" revision and preview it.

Thank you,
Dino.

I'd think that you can have a plugin that allows you to select which
revision is visible by default - you'd select an older revision, but you
should be able to preview the current state of the post as well. Doesn't
sounds like too much work and should in theory work - haven't tested
anything like that before though.

There?s also the Post Forking plugin <https://github.com/post-forking/post-forking>

I?ve never used it, and I think maybe it?s overkill for what you?re after.

Also happened to spot this: https://github.com/ibotty/wp-post-merge I think it would let you create two different posts, and then merge them.

Hi,

does anyone know what's the status of this feature?

http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/

Otto had announced this feature in version 3.7: is there a page where we 
can learn more on how to implement it in our plugins?

Thanks,
Dino.

A lot of language stuff is in 4.0. It will be coming sometime after that.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Extensibility and shortcodes
Message-ID: <CAFnKAk2jXvS7wHwdPD77ZO7PoEuQY9UcTUOnubOYE9i3=4oPUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings all,

I was looking at the wp media shortcode and wp-views, and noticed a few
things that seem not-too-portable in the view ajax and rendering:

In ajax-actions.php of Wordpress 4.0 we see this render-and-return routine
requiring a post_id of post the user can edit:


function wp_ajax_parse_media_shortcode() {
    global $post, $wp_scripts;

    if ( ! $post = get_post( (int) $_REQUEST['post_ID'] ) ) {
        wp_send_json_error();
    }

    if ( empty( $_POST['shortcode'] ) || ! current_user_can( 'edit_post',
$post->ID ) ) {
        wp_send_json_error();
    }

    setup_postdata( $post );
    $shortcode = do_shortcode( wp_unslash( $_REQUEST['shortcode'] ) );

    if ( empty( $shortcode ) ) {
        wp_send_json_error( array(
            'type' => 'no-items',
            'message' => __( 'No items found.' ),
        ) );
    }

    $head = '';
    $styles = wpview_media_sandbox_styles();

    foreach ( $styles as $style ) {
        $head .= '<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="' . $style .
'">';
    }

    if ( ! empty( $wp_scripts ) ) {
        $wp_scripts->done = array();
    }

    ob_start();

    echo $shortcode;

    if ( 'playlist' === $_REQUEST['type'] ) {
        wp_underscore_playlist_templates();

        wp_print_scripts( 'wp-playlist' );
    } else {
        wp_print_scripts( 'wp-mediaelement' );
    }

    wp_send_json_success( array(
        'head' => $head,
        'body' => ob_get_clean()
    ) );
}


Why must this ajax call tie to the post-id of the post page containing the
shortcode to be rendered? Is it meant to soon have "symbolically-linked"
galleries and shortcodes that are linked to multiple post-ids, not just
embedded as shortcode in post_content? Or is there another reason for
requiring a post-id of a post the user can edit, not just "0", when
rendering playlist views?

I also noticed the Javascript mce object functions calling that ajax
action  were hardcoded to look for an element with a certain id, #post_ID.
(in wp-includes/js/media-views.js, wp-includes/js/mce-view.js). While it
works well for the wp-admin pages as given by Wordpress, it seems it could
use a more generic item, like a property in whatever the current tinymce
editor is? What do you think?

Glad to see there is good progress in wp 4.0

Best regards,
Luke

This is meant for rendering the previews for these shortcodes in wpView, 
not for returning the HTML for arbitrary shortcodes.

As this happens only when a user is writing/editing a post, the AJAX 
action requires the post_id and checks if the current user can actually 
edit that post.
