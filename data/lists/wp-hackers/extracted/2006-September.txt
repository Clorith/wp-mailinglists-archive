It  seems  like  Google  wouldn't specify  anything  in  the
headers  (I had a quick look through yours). It's rather odd
because,  at  least in UseNet, it identifies itself  as  G2,
which stands for Google Groups, as the user-agent.

I'll  add an exception for GMail and recompile. There is  no
way to guarantee that a sender with a GMail address actually
uses  GMail.  I think I have just found a candidate  though,
e.g. in your case:

Message-ID: <891be9410608312358l49ff4e8elfe43cb840640fb99@mail.gmail.com>

Can catch the domain with a regex.

I second that.  With wp_insert_post(), you can pretty much fill in as
little info about the post as needed, and WP takes care of the rest.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Putting mod_rewrite rules in httpd.conf
Message-ID: <44F87ADD.9050503@plumlee.org>

I know there was a recent discussion about .htaccess files here.  My 
question, somewhat related, is whether it would be possible to make WP 
honor rules in httpd.conf versus using .htaccess files?  I mentioned 
this once on the support forums, and was properly reminded that not 
everyone has access to the main configuration file for apache.  But if I 
do have access, would this gain any performance increase, and is it even 
possible?

Recommendation from Apache: 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/howto/htaccess.html#when

Basically they say use .htaccess if you don't have access to the config 
file.

Possible? Desirable as an option only, not the default (ain't broken, 
don't fix it)?

WP should do nothing with httpd.conf. We provide the rules, if someone
is so inclined, they can put them in httpd.conf. They need to be put
in a <Directory> block for the WP root, and that's about it.

Hmm, I had tried it and immediately threw an error with WP not being 
able to find the permalink.  I assumed WP didn't honor the rules in the 
<Directory> block, but I didn't test to verify.  Sorry for the noise.  I 
had assumed it WOULDN'T work, instead of actually testing more.  Thanks 
for the response.

Anyone actually do this, or does everyone stick with .htaccess?  I'm 
thinking the best way to do it might be an include statement so the 
rules could be kept in a separate file.

Sure.  Swing over to the support forums (http://wordpress.org/support) and
do a quick search (hint: search support for syndication for a common
response).

This is most definitely:
1) A forums question
2) A plugin issue
3) Addressable by a quick search for 'rss' on wp-plugins.net.  For
instance, http://www.iconophobia.com/wordpress/?page_id=55 and
http://www.zachinglis.com/projects/getrss/ look like decent places to start.

This list is devoted to core WordPress development, in most cases, and
thus isn't a very good place to get such questions addressed in a timely
and/or non-snarky fashion.  *grin*

Or get devs pimping their stuff? Check out SimplePie <http://

Although I know, that is not really what the Codex says:
"The wp-hackers list is meant for people interested in extending
WordPress either through plugins or improvements to the core code."

Doug, I am glad most responses are not snarky, because from the
outside it is not reasonable to know the difference -- I did not find
your comment snarky.

It should read, IMO, "through plugin development..."

Search the forums for "RSS Aggregation"?  OR "CG-FeedRead"? ;)

My two cents:
If you just want the headlines off to the side in your theme, get a
widgets capable theme and use the RSS widget.

If you want to syndicate feeds and import them as posts into your
wordpress installation, get FeedWordPress.

If you want full control now or ever, get SimplePie.

Hmm, let's try this again. It's been an hour-and-a-half, and the first copy
of this message hasn't yet posted.  That's never happened before.
Hopefully, this isn't going to be a re-post...

[...]

>>>somewhat related, is whether it would be possible to make WP  honor 
>>>rules in httpd.conf versus using .htaccess files?

Actually, as I understand it, WP will 'honor' everything you put in either
file (when they are active).  It has no choice.  WP has no idea anything is
happening until after the rewrite engine, wherever it is configured,
releases the formatted request.

So, in short, you can put the stuff anywhere you want it to be.  One thing
though... In the newer versions of WP, all the rewrite rules say to do is
"If this doesn't point at a file, send it to WP.".  If your file has more
than those 9 or so lines total, then either it contains your own
customizations or it is all legacy WP stuff.  The legacy WP stuff is
redundant to what is now included in the WordPress PHP code.  For the
current version of WP, you just need: # BEGIN WordPress <IfModule
mod_rewrite.c> RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteCond
%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule .
/index.php [L] </IfModule> # END WordPress

And all should work fine.

>Anyone actually do this, or does everyone stick with .htaccess?
It is an optimization to stick the rules in the conf file and set
"AllowOverride None".  With "AllowOverride All" every request to the server
results in it repeatedly searching up the directory tree for .htaccess
files.  Any optimization that avoids disk access (even if it is cached) is
to be desired.  I would suspect many people put their stuff in the .conf
file and set it "AllowOverride None" making the server ignore any and all
.htaccess files.

Since Chris did not know a plugin existed and was interested in modifying
the core code to do this, the question seems to be entirely appropriate.
Admittedly searching Google for "wordpress rss feeds on a page" does reveal
a number of related pages, but I think Chris did no harm.  Doug was indeed
polite, as always, in his response.  But IMO, at other times, this list is
too jealously guarded to the detrement of people starting into code
modification.

It's not too hard to keep track of, but will require some tweaking  
for cross browser support.  It may not be worth it in the end.

My SQL db is suddenly 5MB, and not that I mind, but it was 1.x last month.....

Bad Behavior is 1.3 MB, no problem....
Comments, another 1.2 MB, understood...
wp_options is 1.2 MB, no idea why.

I'm not at home or office, so I can't dissect the SQL table ATM, but
off the top of your minds, anyone know if 1.2 MB for the WP_options
table is a bit much?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <44F9D326.8010401@mullenweg.com>

I'm curious about people's thoughts and opinions on the Ultimate Tag 
Warrior plugin.

In my experience, it can often be the source of pretty significant 
performance problems when traffic and/or # of posts/tags goes up.

That said, it's very popular which indicates it is providing 
functionality that is needed.

What's your favorite part of UTW?

Is there functionality UTW provides that we could do in core? (Clouds, etc.)

As a community are there code fixes we could contribute to UTW to help 
its performance for current users?

Probably RSS, probably the planet or technorati ego feed. The RSS 
serialization stores all the info in the RSS feed, event things like 
content:encoded which it might not need.

I use it and like it. I find tags more useful than categories for the way my
site (or is it my brain?) works. Adding additional tags to a post on the fly
is good stuff. I *have* a tag cloud, and occasionally use it, but it's not a
major requirement. 

Good time to ask, as Christine's site (http://www.neato.co.nz/) appears to
be down.

The story there is I thought most of the page overhead was in the 
regular expressions of autop, etc so I thought that just reading the 
post text directly out of the DB would be faster, if less flexible.

The change was so small it was unmeasurable. It's a good example of why 
when tweaking performance it's critical to know where the actual 
bottlenecks are before getting your hands dirty. Premature optimization 
is the root of all evil.

We should distinguish UI issues (how you enter tags/categories) from 
presentational. In core WP provides all the functionality of adding 
categories on the fly currently, although the UI could be done less 
Flickr-like.

I'll ditto Les.  My categories were a disaster at one point, now they're
quite lean as I found tagging worked better for my brain.  At one point I
was pretty sure they helped folks find similar topics, but now I'm not quite
so sure...

And yeah, I have a tag cloud somewhere but it's really not the reason I use
UTW.

Tags seem to be what just about everyone wants. Categories and tags  
play well together and UTW does seem to be the best but it is rather  
top heavy. Personally I'd like to see basic tag support in the core  
and leave the rest (clouds etc.,) to plugins.

IMO, both categories and tags should exist.
Categories explain the overall reference/classification, and tags can
go into post details and proper names of something.

If I wrote a post about the PS2, Xbox360, and Wii, I'd probably file
it under Video Gaming ( or, Video Gaming, Video Gaming -- PS3, Video
Gaming -- Xbox360, Video Gaming -- Wii ) and then tag it with Sony,
Microsoft, Xbox, PS3, Playstation 3, Wii. Nintendo, and perhaps any
games I mentioned.

This is kinda off topic because I myself have never used UTW, but I DO
NOT want categories to go away or be replaced.
I love tags, I love categories, each have their own seperate roles,
and bringing them together makes excellent classification and
organization possible.

*The* common acronym is LAMP.  It originally stood for
Linux/Apache/MySQL/Perl, but it has been expanded to include PHP and
Python for "P", and occasionally "W" instead of "L" for Linux.

AMP is registered trademark of NYPHP, they've got a lot of members from
the local BSD group, which is probably why they found it difficult to
call themselves a LAMP/WAMP group.

Try my plugin: http://ink.bur.st/wordpress-plugins/#kqf

It allows you to embed RSS feeds in posts, pages and templates. It's pretty 
configurable, so should meet most needs.

Our tag/category system is pretty flexible and *can be used for either* 
transparently on the backend. Some people are religious about one or the 
other, nothing said on this list is going to change their minds. I see 
them as a difference in UI, not anything fundamentally different in storage.

*Especially* if you have a tech-related site (my example is the
NeoSmart Files), tags are a godsend. With something new everyday, it
just doesn't warrant the creation of a category.... which _seems_ to
be a bigger deal because it's a part of the core of WP's
functionality. For me, I used to have a trillion different categories
with one post each, but now I have 4 general categories, a couple of
subs, and a million tags.. my load has gone DOWN although readership
has gone UP... not sure what that's all about, but I have 6 million
hits a month, and NeoSmart's tag pages are some of the most popular..
so I dunno...

I still disagree entirely. Categories have heirarchy. It is the
fundamental difference that keeps me using categories instead of tags.
Categories are organized, tags are not. But instead of summing up my
thoughts again, here's a few links to some likeminded people.

The category table has some stuff in it that is not needed for a tag, 
but it's not a lot.  I use cats as tags (actually I'm pretty lazy about 
using either). I type comma separated lists of tags into the Category 
box on the Write Post screen and never bother with the Manage Categories 
page.  Nor do I bother with the Cat checklist on the Write Post screen. 
  I just type tags into the Add box.

How many folks use both cats and tags?  Adding a "type = cat|tag" field 
to the categories table or introducing a new tags table is easily done, 
but the UI is the hard part.  Having both concepts exposed on the Write 
Post screen would be confusing.  Perhaps only expose Cats and let people 
use them as either cats and tags use a plugin for those who want to both 
categorize and tag.

They're not the same, but it doesn't make much of difference to the 
backend which way they are used.  We don't care if category_parent is 
always empty.

I agree with what others have said.  Categories are a more permanent
solution, whereas tags are kinda throw-away.  I have no problem giving
a post a tag that I might not ever use again.  Just whatever is on my
mind at the moment.

Categories on the other hand infer something long-term: You'll be
putting more posts of a similar nature in that category, in the
future.

I also have hundreds of tags, and I don't want to see a long list of
tags similar to the list of categories on the write page.  So even if
they're some what similar on the backend, they need to be treated
differently.

With default filters, yeah... it's useless.  With Textile2, it is of  
more use, because Textile2 is much more of a CPU/memory hog than our  
lean 'n mean wpautop and wptexturize.  So, not really of use for  
default, but if you're adding a whole bunch of third party regex,  
preprocessing might eventually benefit you.  Of course, pick your  
battles, this shouldn't be your first optimization.

To compare with printed media, categories are like the table of
contents, tags are like the index.  Both have value -- categories are
the author's way of saying: this is in this section; tags are raw lookup
for things the indexer (tagger?) thought you'd want to look for.

In fact, you could argue that Search is better than tags, I can look for
anything I want.  One could even say that tags are simply "suggestions
for searches".

I, like I think many people, have struggled to make categories fit my
needs.  Do I simply categorize like crazy (as one replier suggested) and
risk having a category list that is huge/impenetrable?  Or do I have a
sparse and useful category list (as another suggested) at the expense of
making things findable (if I don't use UTW or similar)?

I'd like to see the core code provide both a category and index (tag)
system.  As you suggested, this is a minor change to the base tables
(one field in the category table?).  I think the changes to the write
post interface could be made easily enough (one add'l field for tags).

But I recoil at making UI changes that use this system part of the core.
I find clouds to be a cute trick, but really not that useful.  Is it
that meaningful that some keyword is tagged 1,000 vs 10 times, if I'm
just trying to find that keyword?  It's neat for social sites where you
want to see what people are talking about, but is it that useful for
more informational sites?

I'd prefer an "index page" where I could search the index, then find the
references.  But that's just me.  This, to me, makes the
display/UI/presentation part of this question very much theme/plug-in
author territory.

I agree.  I have a tag cloud, but mostly because I think it's nifty.
It also gives some idea of what's on my mind the most, but for the
most part when I'm looking at a tag cloud, I go straight for what I'm
looking for.   So I think it would be great if WP had core
functionality to support tags, but leave the clouds and such up to
plugin developers.

Not to be redundant, but I second that opinion. Just have place under the
categories when posting to add tags in comma separated values.

Agreed. Having tags only would drive me nuts. I use UTW on my blog 
that's in development.

When I write a post there, I file it under a category (like everyone 
does), and then I tag it with some post specific keywords. This makes it 
easy to browse posts of a certain type (via categories) and yet still 
find posts on a certain subject (via tags).

Performance might be a bit better now that UTW doesn't make any  
queries to get its tags (I told you about this in SF).  Now it caches  
them in a serialized postmeta array, so no additional queries are  
needed for regular WP views.  Tag views will still have to hit the  
DB, obviously.

The problem that I see is that although WP's category system can be  
used as a tagging system (you just ignore hierarchy), it can't be  
used simultaneously as a tagging and categorization system.  It's  
hard to store a flat, gratuitously-added world of tags in conjunction  
with a more planned out hierarchical organizational category  
structure.  Some people want both.

There's also the issue of the category list.  For a pure tagging  
interface, you do away with the list altogether and just do Flickr- 
style tagging.  Text entry box, list of currently applied tags, and a  
way to remove an existing tag.

Hopefully my "cache in postmeta" patch helped... it certainly sped my  
site up.

In-Reply-To: <44F9EF71.40105@mullenweg.com>
Message-ID: <MJEEIIFCKOJBBNFPJGJCKELIONAA.angsuman@taragana.com>

Hi,

One of the problems I face with comments is the inability to archive comments. Let me explain. Often I get comments which can neither be approved, because they are personal and directed to me only, nor can they be deleted, because they are important. I don't like to defer them either because a. they very soon tend to clutter up the queue and b. they have a tendency to inadvertently get approved. These are the comments I want to reply to in my own time. In an email client I have a special folder where I archive such action items.
So my specific proposal is - can we create a way to archive / file certain comments without approving them?

My generic proposal is - can we create a framework to create multiple comment folders and drag-n-drop comments to them instead of the current simplistic workflow or approve/spam/delete/do nothing?

Best,
Angsuman

Yep, that's another UI issue. When we originally added the on-the-fly 
tag adding I put a limit on the # of category checkboxes shown on the 
write screen and limited it to the top 100 by use.

This limit introduced a bug, which will be fixed before 2.1, which is 
why it's temporarily off in the 1.5 series.

If people can to step back from their biases and frustrations and try to 
examine the root cause of their thoughts, I think we can come to a nice 
middle-of-the-road solution that addresses a good variety of use cases.

In some ways our system is like a really, really good tag 
implementation. If you look on delicious or flickr and what power users 
of tags complain about, and it's generally the same thing: they want to 
group them (create hierarchies) and they want to retroactively rename them.

Someone could start off using WP in a tag-like fashion, and then 
organize it later should they so choose. Or they could do like 
avalonstar.com and have 8 categories with every post only in one forever 
and ever amen.

Perhaps a better question would have been: For folks using the WP 
"thing" in a tag-like on-the-fly manner, are there things we could do in 
the interface or template functions we could provide to make that easier?

One of the strengths of tags over categories is creating ad hoc
hierarchies with tag joins of various kinds (so "wordpress AND
community" is like a child-category of either "wordpress" or
"community"). I can't remember if this is possible in the core or not.
If it is, there's still no exposed UI for navigating such hierarchies
-- for example, a link from the "wordpress" category archive page to
the "wordpress AND community" category archive page.

It'd also be nice to have:

* A template function to get a list of related tags. (That is, other
tags used on the same posts as the tag being viewed.)

* A template function to display a tag cloud.

* A simple text input for free-form tagging on the post screen. Even
better if it can do some Javascript tag autocompletion and
autosuggestion magic. And doubles as a pony.

* A way to see on the post screen how often you have used certain tags before.

* A template function to display a list of posts using similar tags.

I don't want to speak for Sean, but  my concern would be with output, not
UI on the backend.  I may want to simply list the more generalized
categories, and only show the tags on a post, with a possible cloud some
where else on the site.  With UTW and WP cats, i can easily do that.
 Admittedly, I haven't explored the categories template tag in 2.1 that
much, but is that easily done with the current system?  And I emphasis
easily, as new users and theme coders would want to be able to use a few
simple parameters or template tags.
I suppose a work around would be to create a category, "tags", and then have
all the tags as a children of the parent category, and simply exclude that
cat from the list, but that seems as a hack.

Another concern I would have with building on tagging in future releases is
backward compatibility to plugins like UTW or Bunny's.  Would there be an
import feature of some sort?  Or would that be a one time use plugin?
Otherwise, current users who employ UTW would be left out of the new
features.

One reason I personally started using UTW wast he fact that prior to 2.0,
cats couldn't be added on the fly, so I opted to go the tagging route.  So
more or less, I'm stuck with that system, unless I want to go  back to go
back to each post and manually create categories for each tag.

So I guess a second question would be is the emphasis on embracing this
approach more for new users, or would existing users, especially pre
2.0adopters, be covered?

Also a lot of the necessary bloat in UTW could be trimmed off if the
functionality was built into the core.  I've written generic tagging
systems in under 40 lines of code, and UTW is at least a few thousand
lines of code.  That's not saying a WP tagging system would be so
light-weight, but it wouldn't need to be as big a project as UTW.  So
that might increase performance.

Yes, there are plenty of hooks in place for this. A plugin should be
perfect for this behavior.

I agree with the suggestion to take a step back with looking at it as
a question of user experience without the hefty weight of the terms
categories and tags.

Based on the discussion so far the general goals seems to be:
* navigation
* searchability


Navigation: generally it seems that an interface for visitors that has
a few terms is desirable. Things like "personal", "shopping", "job",
etc. For a publisher it is desirably also being able to choose easily
from this few categories.


Searchability: the ability to improve searchability by having many
terms associated with a post.

(Term recommendation was also mentioned, but I generally dislike the
concept of "white sheep" terming unless it is purely synonym
searching, and that should really be handled on the search engine
side, but it is not currently)


Other concepts mentioned:

Hierarchy: hierarchy is useful for navigation. My experience has been
that most people only create shallow, simply hierarchies, if at all.

Relationships over hierarchy  seem more interesting to me.


What else?

If there was some kind of a tag repository in the core,  I'd be fine with
pointing the presentation-grade stuff at it (Which, really, is the most
interesting bit of the plugin).

(I also periodically think about turning the tag suggestion bit into a
separate plugin - is this something people would find useful?)

I use it (UTW Plugin) on my blog/site. Mostly because I was new to  
tagging and really liked the idea of offering a tag cloud to the  
user. Since my initial install of this plug I've come across other  
coding examples to build my own tag cloud. Here is one: http:// 
www.codeprofessor.com/journal/2006/03/15/building-a-tag-cloud-in- 
wordpress/

I've also not come to the understanding that WP can use it's own  
categories as well tags. I had no idea this was so functional. I tend  
to think of content categories as a separate concept from tags. Here  
is a article I read a while back that for some reason set my bias  
against using categories as tags. http://lorelle.wordpress.com/ 
2006/03/01/tags-are-not-categories-got-it/. since reading through  
these emails I've been playing with just using categories and setting  
up my permalinks so my posts show up in the URL like '/tag/...'.  
Seems simple enough and functional.

All of this makes me wonder about this WP pages http://wordpress.com/ 
tags/ Are tags being offered in the next WP release?

And I also update the table wp_postmeta.

But sometimes I have the following error :

I don't actually use UTW, but I got annoyed that Typo had both
categories and tags built into the core, when it seemed like a lot of
duplication of functionality. Can't you do an awfully good facsimile
of tags by simply having two top-level categories for "Category
Parent" and "Tag Parent", and then working from there?

Obviously the primary difference between the two is how you enter
them---tickboxes versus a text field, but couldn't that difference be
provided-for in plugin hooks?

That's exactly what I was wondering about.  I'm going to try this out

I've tried and and it works. For the sake of example here is my  
actual Virtual Host entry. This is a local copy of WordPress pulled  
from Subversion this weekend. Fresh install.

During the setup I went through my normal configuration via Options - 
 > Permalinks. Once I have generated the .htaccess file I copied the  
contented into my httpd.conf and then removed the .htaccess file.

I'm not sure what happend to the Options -> Permalinks coding if you  
later attempt to update the .htaccess file.

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
     ServerName dev.wpsvn.com
     ServerAdmin webmaster
     DocumentRoot 	/usr/local/htdocs/dev/dev.wpsvn.com

     CustomLog 		/private/var/log/httpd/dev/dev.wpsvn.com/access_log  
common
     <Directory 		/usr/local/htdocs/dev/dev.wpsvn.com>
         AllowOverride All
		# BEGIN WordPress

			RewriteEngine On
			RewriteBase /wordpress/
			RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
			RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
			RewriteRule . /wordpress/index.php [L]
		</IfModule>
		# END WordPress

	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

[4163] trunk: Revert accidental commit.Hi there.

Possibly off topic - apologies if it is. 

How do you get the HTML formatted emails that you send out of subversion. I have set up the post-commit hook in subversion and I get emails from it to say a comment has been added plus all the details, but they are in plain-text, I have tried a few I have found on the net, but they all seem to put out in plain text.

Any help or pointers to any of your help pages would be much appreciated.

Cheers
Nigel.

Not directly related to SVN, but if you want to send out HTML- 
formatted email summarizing recent posts from a WP blog, I've  
released WP-Digest 2.0, which is now capable of sending your choice  
of plain text or multipart text/html messages. It includes the  
phpMailer class to handle the multipart stuff.

I take it you've moved .htaccess out of the way? If so, the above should 
work fine. However, you're not going to get any performance improvement 
unless you also set "AllowOverride None", like Brian said. The whole 
point of moving the rewrite rules into your httpd.conf is to /not/ go 
checking the drive for .htaccess files.

The .htaccess file doesn't need to be updated when permalinks change. 
(It used to in a former version of wordpress, which resulted in huge 
lists of rules.)

Yeah sorry. The line 'AllowOverride Al' was the original line.  
Agreed. Now that I moved the rewrite rules to the httpd.conf I no  
longer need this and can allow the global setting to apply.

As for the change in the Permalinks I mentioned. What I meant was the  
warning or error or whatever it is if you attempt to update the rules  
and you do not have an .htaccess file. You get the message something  
like 'Please update your .htaccess file.' I'm sure I've mis-quoted so  
no flaming please. Anyway it's not an error and correct the rewrite  
rules in the httpd.conf don't need to change.

That is just run off the regular category system, we just call it tags. 
People like it because it drives traffic to their blog and allows them 
to discover similar blogs.

Interesting notes from WP.com experience:

* We get about 2 tags/categories per post, which is in line with 
Flickr's average

* When we asked recently about people's favorite feature, categories 
were the overwhelming choice:

http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/09/02/favorite-feature/

Which makes me hesitant to rock the boat too much.

Is it fair to base the future  of  WordPress  on  comments from bloggers at
wp.com?  Specifically beginners who don't work with modifying or editing
their template files?

Agreed.  I recall when I first started blogging I was quickly up to 50+
categories in a deep hierarchy.  Happily.  Because, frankly, I didn't know
any better or alternatives.

When I finally came to grok the concept of tags/taxonomy I quickly cut down
to 4 or 5 categories -- and lots of tags.  My complexion cleared up, I lost
10 lbs and my cholesterol dropped dramatically.  Truly, tags are a win.
(ok, maybe that last part was a bit exaggerated).

To me, what people do is much more interesting than what they say. That 
said, "categories" is the last feature in WP I would have expected to be 
on top.

It sounds a bit clunky to me as it means we need to force a db upgrade of
everyones categories on update to reparent them under this hidden root.

Can we not extend the schema for the wp_cats table to have a cat_type
field which could be set to category|tag|keyword|something else to allow
for multiple types of information to be stored in the one table much in
the same way we support posts|pages

We can then change the category template and db support functions to
support this new schema and extend them to build tags into the core

No different than what you propose below via a column addition to the
wp_cats table.

Would you store this as a VARCHAR or as an ENUM?  The advantage of
Mike's suggestion is that, in order to add further category/tag/etc.
types, all one need do is add a parent node and then make all
cats/tags/etc. that they add from then on children of that node.  Plugin
auths could then automatically take advantage of this capability simply
by specifying a category as a root node and working their namespaces off
of said node.

I wasn't thinking of it so much as a core thing, more just as a
mechanism for plugins to implement tagging in a non-disruptive way.
Kind of like the comment-parent thing; if there's a common way that
tagging is done across all plugins and themes, then it becomes more
portable, etc.

If it were going to be core, it would probably make more sense to add
a new field to the table.

UTW is installed an in use on my site, although I don't feel all that
strongly about them. Tag clouds don't excite me. I do think, however, that
at least some part of UTW could be in the core because I know that many
people consider tagging to be essential.

I don't notice any load, but I have a low-volume site so it really doesn't
matter that much anyway.

Why no link to the plugin page itself?  Usually that's the place for
detailed instructions, problem-solving, etc.

There are possibly dozens of questions that can be asked for each
plugin.  In the end I decided to let the plugin authors have control.
Some plugin authors may not want to be bothered by so many questions.
If they want to put a link to the plugin page in the description, they
can.  The [url] BBCode tag is supported. :)

However if more plugin authors agree with you, I'll add it.

I don't care a bit about tag clouds-- but I vastly prefer tags over
categories  (and they aren't the same thing, though cats can act like
tags in a pinch). However, the one thing that is really missing from
the tagging implementations-- as far as I can tell-- are tag
intersections. Which are vital to make tags work. Then I don't need
categories at all-- I don't need hierarchy, just association.

Even when intersections are possible, there don't seem to be
standard/automated ways to choose a tag and then be presented with all
tags associated with that tag (in order to choose an intersection),
etc...

I believe dev.wp-plugins.org is strictly geared towards plugin
developers, and not bloggers.  A blogger looking for a plugin doesn't
go to dev.wp-plugins.org, that's mostly for plugin developers to use
to share their work with each other.  It's just a trac front-end to a
SVN repository.

WPPlugins.org is geared towards bloggers looking for plugins, and
authors looking to distribute their plugins, and get feedback.

Please make it optional, then--what happens when a plugin author lapses 
in their updates of the WPPlugins site and subsequent visitors to the 
page end up downloading an old version?

The way wp-plugins.net does it is better, IMO :)

As I see it, the author give his/ her web address, when the register,
and that address is shown on the page for that plugin.
This of course is not necessarily the authors plugins page.

I added the number of votes per Austin's request.  I'll add an option
to put in the page on your website for the actual plugin's page.
Anything else?

For now it's the same thing.  If you update your plugin's info, such
as changing the version number, your plugin gets relisted on the front
page as being updated.  I'll be keeping on eye on that, and if it
becomes a point of abuse (authors always making minor changes to
relist their plugin), I'll make changes so that only updates to the
version number warrant a relisting.

I am also basing my point on the time I spent in the forums over the past
year and a half, specifically before UTW was released (and Bunny's tagging
app was updated), when people were looking to implement tagging systems, and
Technorati was more of a rage.  As I stated, users who've been with WP since
1.5 wanted a tagging system.  Many discussions, and implementations arose.

I still stand by my point, and question.  Is this about new users, and users
of WP since 2.0?

I think it'd be great if tagging were a concept supported by the core.

I haven't seen this mentioned, but it'd be nice if tag synonyms were native.
(JavaScript = ECMAScript, etc.)

How about trying to make as much of the process as possible automated?
I listed WP-Cats on there, but I seriously doubt I'll log in to update
it on new versions. Couldn't you have it download each one on a cron,
and actually *check* the plugin's internal version number?

That's not a bad idea Mike.  Also I've got some XML-RPC services built
into the system, and I'm hard at work now on a WP plugin that'll let
you manage your plugin data from the WP admin area.  Which is probably
a place you spend a lot of time anyway.

Assuming that plugin authors have followed such a standard methodology,

Yes and No. You remove the need for extra entries in the table just an

Varchar all the way - the same as the posts tables post_type (in 2.1 at
least) - if you go  down the enum route plugin's have to do table
upgrades to extend it and it gets broken by the db upgrade stuff on a
WordPress upgrade

Surely the best people to ask what they want are the people who use the 
product. :)

I think its great that the developers care enough to want to improve their 
product to incorporate what people want, mind you I am trying to incorporate 
WP into some Social Networking stuff a client of mine wants, and for the 
most part my client doesn't know what they want :)

wp-login.php?action=register? Right now, there's code duplicated in both 
(some Javascript, the header HTML, etc.)  So, I think we should merge 
the registration into the login script.

I'd be more than happy to make a patch if people think this is a good 
idea, but I thought I'd ask before I went to all the trouble.

lol...

Yeah, Google Groups (abbreviated <GG> :P) is just a nice frontend to
mailing lists. It lets you treat them kind of like forums, for those
that prefer not to use an email client for these kinds of things.....

There are other sites for starting your own mailing list... but
anything officially WP would have to be @lists.automattic.com.... did
you have an idea?

This is outside my experience level, and it seems suspect anyway (as Westi
has already commented), but is leaving the relevant code in the post good
form?

Probably best to strip the code.

The source is here:

I tried this against my sandbox 2.0.4 install and it didn't do anything.

No sign of SQL inject into any of the database queries as examined from
the dump produced by Ryans excelent dump_queries plugin [1]

Fine by me, but you'll have to make wp-register.php redirect to wp- 
login.php?action=register, in case people have hardcoded links.

No, I didn't want to start a mailing list, although if I did, I would be
using Google Groups for sure.

I had previously seen the mirror option in Google Groups while creating
my jv-guestbook-svn group which logs the SVN commits for my Guestbook
project. And yes, I did get the idea from the K2 folks :).

I did have an idea that an easier interface to wp-hackers could be made
although I already knew of Nibbles or whatever it was that that FlipCorp
guy used to reply to that Chameleon thread. The Google Group was just an
experiment...I guess I should have experimented on my own list than on a
busy public list.

I guess we all make mistakes but here's a sorry from me.

We cast "paged" to an int and then take the absolute value.  We've got 
it covered.

Thanks for all the feedback.  For future reference then, to be sure, I'll
copy any relevant code, delete it from the post, and forward it to security
AT wordpress dot org?

I agree.  A simple solution would be a spin-off of the new
'admin_head-' . $plugin_page action hooks in the admin header: add
something like do_action('admin_head-login') to the header in
wp-login.php

+1 (I'd do a +20, if I could).

This is the only code I have to touch with a new install as well
(wp-login and the .css).

I've often found myself wishing I could easily add additional fields to 
the login form, not just CSS to the existing form. Action hooks in the 
form body (and probably right after </form>) would be wonderful.

Actually, just having a hook into the wp-login head would be a huge step
forward. If you could put in your own CSS, I'd be well on my way. Having it
as part of the theme system makes sense to me, but I'm guessing that there's
some reason it wasn't done in the first place.

I have, and I think it looks great. The only thing is that I force a login
to view some of my sites running on WP, and people were getting confused
with all of the Wordpress stuff when they expected to see something else
(like the name of the site).

What I'd like to do is to customize the new login page, though, because I
think it looks pretty nice.

Trying to develop a theme (at test.samdevol.com) that has 2 columns and 
a sidebar. I'm trying to use the query_posts (running 2 separate loops 
in index.php) and have success with hard-coding e.g.; 
query_posts('cat=2,-11&showposts=10'); in each separate loop, but when I 
try to make use of Ozh's Theme Tool Kit to allow users control of which 
categories are displayed in the columns it breaks. Whether I build a 
function and use it
$cats2=corporate_slave_col2cats() . corporate_slave_postquant(); 
query_posts($cats2); echo $cats2; 
or I use variables
global $corporate_slave; $cats2= 
"'".$corporate_slave->option['col2cats']. '&showposts='. 
$corporate_slave->option['postquant']. "'"; query_posts($cats2); echo 
$cats2;
I end up with the correct string echoed from $cats2, but it just 
displays all categories.

Any suggestions?

Good day,

I'm rather new to the WordPress development area, but looking at the API,
I've found it to be slightly inconsistent?

An example of what I'm talking about are these two functions:
* the_time($f) vs get_the_time($f) -- to print vs return a date/time for a
post
* single_cat_title('prefix', 'display') -- set 'display' to true or false
to either display or return the value

I'm wondering if there's a desire to move 'all' the functions to one or
the other method of doing things?

Cheers,
Mike

I've noticed that the top part of the login / registration / etc. form 
code is in the 2 files like 6 times in whole.

I was thinking of making some mini-functions within wp-login.php to 
output the top and bottom parts of the HTML so that it's all in one 
place (rather than duplicated multiple times).

Thoughts on this?

Oh, and you can checkout what I have so far here:

http://test.viper007bond.com/wordpress-latest/wp-login.php

The only new things really so far are just some tweaking. The whole top 
is now a link to WordPress.org in FF rather than just a little bit and 
the bottom links are rearranged and such. Still some issues in IE 
though, but those were in the current SVN copy too.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Make wp_setcookie() accept an expire parameter?
Message-ID: <45028E58.9060304@viper007bond.com>

I was thinking it'd be cool if wp_setcookie() could accept a parameter 
for when to make the cookie expire. Modifying $remember might do this, 
but I'm not sure if that'd break things, so adding a new parameter may 
be the only way to maintain backwards compatibility.

The idea came up while modifying the login form and I saw this:

<input name="rememberme" type="checkbox" id="rememberme" value="forever" 
tabindex="3" />

If a filter was applied to that "forever", then a plugin could control 
how long users stay logged in for (for those who want users to 
auto-logout after X amount of time from logging in for security 
purposes). Although I guess a plugin could do this manually via standard 
PHP and admin area hooks...

Thoughts?

I'm new to the development side of WordPress as well (hello all :)), and
I've noticed the same thing. Doing it the single_cat_title('prefix',
'display') way is in my opinion the preferred solution, it's much easier for
the template designers to work with a single function for both displaying
and returning the value, than to use two different functions.

Why can't one make the_time() and get_the_time() identical, except have the
one return and the other display the value as default? For example
the_time($d='', display=true) and get_the_time($d='', display=false)? After
all the_time() is a wrapper function for get_the_time() which again uses
get_post_time(). Then template designers can use both functions in the same
way, and older templates won't be affected because of the default display
parameter. The same applies to other similar functions.

Just my 2 cents.. Hope I can contribute and give back to the wonderful
WordPress community :)

The WordPress way favours the current way get_the_time and the_time work
I believe.

WordPress Template tags in general are designed to work without you
supplying any arguments getting a sensible default result.

The ones that do take arguments are tending towards query string style
over argument lists as it makes it _much_ easier to provide just the
arguments that you are interested in.

I just downloaded Barthelme from plaintxt.org and found this in the footer:

Is this common in themes now? For people running theme directories, what 
is your policy on themes that have ads in theme?

Personally I'm fine with a credit link, but I'd rather not have someone 
else's ads in my theme any more than I'd put their Adsense code.

This is something that would put me off.

I wouldn't mind it there if the list of features detailing the theme
told me it was there _before_ I downloaded.  But even then I would
probably remove it.

It's becoming more and more common.  wpthemes.info all the downloads there,
I believe, have similar links in the footer as well.

And to think, my first release, I felt guilty putting a link back to my site
in the footer...

I've noticed that, and well, if someone wants to use it, let them, I  
wouldn't. Personally, I just leave the credit link to the original  
designer (i've ported quite a few open source designs from  
openwebdesign.org) and anyone can remove that if they wish.

themes.wordpress.net has it's share too.
I used to make noises in the forums when I found hidden links in
footers, hidden adsense blocks and such but then some theme authors ...
made a financial decision and some crap businesses knocked a few themes
together for SEO.
Average user look in the footer? No - why would they?

Exploitation?
Fair business use?
Reward for days of toil and sweat over the burning CSS?

It's a scam.

I don't agree to this, even if it's a bit funny ;)
I don't think it's fair play to pick on this old ( Internet time wise ) 
story, that Mat got tough treatment for at the time.
He has recognized he was in a gray zone, and explained the what and why.
That "experiment" was also firmly brought to an end.

IMHO, of course ;)

I installed that theme on my own site, and didn't notice the ad until after.
At first I was put off by it, because it wasn't really "spelled out" that it
would be there, but then I decided that I would leave it, given the fact
that it was there to support to the author of the theme who had put a lot of
time into the work.

However, after a short time, I removed the theme totally. For me, it came
down to this; LOTS of people have given LOTS of time and energy to WordPress
to make it successful, and they ask for nothing but a simple "thank you"
once in a while. It's all about the good karma (see Podz's tagline -
couldn't say it any better than that).

I don't have an issue with someone wanting to be compensated for their time
and efforts -- thankfully I have many options available and can choose to
install a theme or plugin that doesn't have such an ad built in.

This isn't a judgement of anyone, I'm just stating some simple facts as I
see them.

Cheers to all.
Craig.

Hello,

Well, I'm not really a newbie...really.  I'm just a newbie on
wp-hackers.  I've been watching this plethora of information dribble
into my inbox (and at times flood it), and I am really anxious to help
out if I can.

I've been developing plugins for quite some time now, although none
have ever been released to the public...until today.  I've created a
plugin that allows me to customize the display of the login,
registration, and reset password forms on my site.

I pretty much copied the core logic from wp-login.php and
wp-register.php into the plugin and I've now made it available.
Interestingly enough, there was a discussion just last night about
this which is what prompted me to clean it up and release it.

I've also downloaded, installed, and am familiarizing myself with
Subversion so that I can hopefully contribute in some small way to
WordPress itself.  Two areas I am deeply interested in pursuing
further:

1)  The discussion about hooking into the WP login/reg process (in
hopes to make my brand new shiny plugin obsolete)
2)  The discussion about categories.  One thing that seems like it
should definitely be included in the core is the ability to sort
categories.

Thanks for the amazing tool and system.  If anyone is interested in
looking at the plugin, they can see it here:  <http://www.jameskelly.org/wordpress-plugins/custom-login-and-registration-forms-plugin/>

Please let me know if any of you have any comments regarding the
plugin or otherwise.

After 18 months, you'd think that water was way under that bridge...

Have you thought that perhaps Matt and others have listened to the
feedback and are more careful about commercialization because of it?
Hence the concern now?

Live and let live is quite a bit different from "let you use my website
for your gain".

Live and let live means (in this case) don't do anything to stop you
from putting your ads wherever you want in your theme.

But that also means I don't have to use your theme and Matt doesn't have
to promote it.

Eh.  <shrugs>  WordPress's default blogroll links have the same effect
(times a few hundred thousand), and I don't think anybody would begrudge
Matt that.

All I'm saying is that I don't think it's worth your time worrying about it.
There's really no positive effect to be had in denying WordPress fans link
karma crumbs.

Should I take your response to mean you believe the theme author
should realize the use of text ads is a big mistake*, perform a
(very public) mea culpa over it, and then pull the ads from all
current and future themes?

Otherwise I don't follow the purpose behind the reference.

It's funny how everyone here is responding. Like it or not, It's his  
full right to put ads in his themes. I don't like it, but I still  
believe it's his full right.

Yes, it's his right. But WordPress doesn't have to support this practice by
excluding all themes with a text link ad in the footer from the official
repository (themes.wordpress.net). Personally, I agree with you taht it's
his full right, but if WordPress is morally opposed to this, then it doesn't
have to support it.

First, I don't consider my email to be a response; I intentionally did
not give a viewpoint or opinion on it. I was querying Charles to ask
if he viewed the addition of the ad as a mistake, based on the issue
he refers to (and its actual outcome).

Second, I could be wrong but I don't believe anyone is asserting theme
authors do not have a right to place ads in themes. Similar to non-GPL
themes, plugins and whatnot, rather I think it's being asked how we in
the community view the practice, and whether we should make the wp.org
resources available to them or not.

Full Disclosure:

I think this is about full disclosure.

If a theme author (or other open source developer for that matter) includes
links and adsense ads with their own account number (yuk) etc they should
simply declare that at the point of download. They should also say whether
they allow you to remove these or not.

Nice and transparent and helps somebody gain recognition or money or
whatever - nothing wrong with that.

If it is not disclosed up front I think it is simply wrong.

It's not the fact ads are there.
It's the fact that the ads are in the footer - a file rarely touched by
most bloggers I would guess - and that there is no acknowledgement that
the ads ARE there. It's stealth linking. It's relying on ignorance to
get backlinks. There are spammy companies that are creating these themes
for this very purpose.

If you look in the footer you will see that information. Should that

"Feel free to use and modify but please provide credits." is not GPL.

Same no-licence-declared behaviour at wpthemes.info and yet lots of ads
and not a single mention anywhere that if you use a theme you are
providing a backlink.

I can see that author's want reward for creating a theme - that isn't
the problem. But they are getting bloggers to pay for that reward
unwittingly. But then spammy crap like Indigo is almost there _just_ for
the sponsor cash.

"This theme has a sponsored link which you are free to remove" would be
better surely? Telling the blogger and allowing them to make a
considered decision - or would telling the blogger have them removing
the link?

If people want to run these types of ads on their own site, that's their 
own business.

The core of what's bothering me here is themes are being used as a 
trojan horse to get thousands and thousands of links across unknowing blogs:

http://technorati.com/search/digitalflowers.com

Everyone has their own reasons for what they do, and I'm not saying we 
should attack anyone. The real question is: As a community, is this the 
type of thing we want to encourage in the future? My gut says no. It's a 
slippery slope.

Some interesting suggestions have been brought up thus far:

* Up front disclosure if it is a "sponsored" theme
* Themes with ads, plugins with ads, etc should not be promoted on 
WP.org sites

(As an aside, I would love to see a way for more theme authors to get 
paid, and it's something I'm working on.)

Good  call, Matt. It's inappropriate in my eyes. I know  you
don't  want  to say how you truly feel about it,  being  the
'nice  character'.  I mean, you weren't even blunt when  DRM
messed about with your Windows PC.

Previously, it was the removal of WP credits from blogs that
had  you bothered, as well as De Bernardy selling  WordPress
(including  modification  of  plugins  without   re-release,
disclosure,  or collaboration with the original authors).  I
think  that  policing WP in this way is nothing that  should
leave  you in an uncomfortable position, let alone have  you
too shy to raise it.

Best wishes,

Roy

I  think Charles flagged a possible case of hypocrisy, but I
have  always  stuck with the assumption that each person  is
permitted  to make impulsive mistakes, especially at the age
of 21.

Please  do  criticise me if I'm wrong, but as I said  in  my
previous  message,  I  actually  think that  it  verges  the
unethical  (no notification), adverse to openness (no option
for  removal), and a wee bit greedy. I wouldn't like to find
KDE  peppered with all sorts of links any time soon. Windows
Vista,  on  the  contrary, does take this approach  (ads  in
login  screen and, more latterly, links to Windows Live  all
over  the  O/S). My speculation is that there will  be  many
last-minute  changes  to tackle antitrust laws,  before  the
product hits production and ends up on the shelf. Unethical,
closed,  greedy  (and not competitive). Even the  shills  at
Microsoft Watch have criticised the move. And to return back
to  topic,  I think WordPress (Automattic) should have  been
contacted  before some supposedly viral content was embedded
in  the  theme.  WP  1.5.0 was criticised at  the  time  for
HotLinking  an  image, which could raise  spyware  concerns.
That was benign, but enough to stir up a storm in a teacup.

Best wishes,

Roy

After reading through all responses to Matt's question whether 
wordpress.org should  promote  themes with  built in ads.
For wordpress.com, which offers free blog hosting there could be the 
suspicion that WP.COM is secretly promoting some flowering business ;)

I'd  say no!

Themes that are released under the same license as WordPress, should not 
contain the author's sponsor links or any other ads.
Such a theme is free and the reward for the author is the appreciation 
of bloggers using it.
Harsh? I don' think so.
We contribute to the community effort for fun, the possible 15 minutes 
in the lime light and for social reasons.

A link in the footer pointing to the author's site is more relevant, and 
in my opinion a good idea.
I have fond myself looking in the footer of a good theme to see who made 
it,
because I like it and want to test it for my own blog.
If it is there, I don't have to check out the CSS or the html <head> 
section for the origin of the theme.
As for plugins, a link to the author is relevant and useful.

Admittedly these themes are GPL, and the blogger is allowed to change 
the theme.
In the referred case, the ad link is not hidden, but as Podz expresses 
it, "stealth linking",
and will in most cases not be removed. The blogger is in many cases 
unaware of his/her
promotion of some business, that the he/she may not want to promote.

Something like that, I believe should not be part of a GPL'd product.

Let's ask the authors of free themes, plugins or other additions to the 
WordPress platform, not to include such promotional machinery in their 
products.

The authors spend much time in the development of themes and plugins, 
and i is reasonable to want some money out of it, but if they do, they 
are going pro, and there is nothing to stop them from drilling their own 
license and selling their products on a commercial basis.

Exactly. And if Charles had bothered some reading up a bit on the

he shouldn't have made that reference.

It might be difficult to judge.  Maybe the defensive side of
the story was neglected for brevity.

Best wishes,

PS  -  I  strongly  agree with your previous  post  on  this
thread.  Several  valid points were made. To add  just  one:
'third-party' links that are bought for SEO purposes subvert
otherwise-fine  SERP's.  That  in itself is  an  abomination
which  harbours  the death of an Open and democratic Web  --
one of those aims that WordPress, being standards-compliant,
Free and suitable for all, strives to address.

Check it out boys and girls:

Feel free to test the registration, login, lost pass, etc. and let me 
know if you encounter any problems. That's my test blog, so I don't mind. ;)

For those who missed my previous e-mails, here's what's new:

* It's now totally skinned (the register page looks poor in the current 
SVN as it's only 1/2 skinned)

* Cleanup of the bottom links

* Now looks correct in IE (had to use an IE conditional tag though sadly)

* Tons of new hooks and filters so you can customize to your heart's content

For example, one of the new hooks in action (this was done totally via a 
plugin):

http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/1278/iheartwpyn2.png

There's also now a hook in the <head> so that you can load up your own 
stylesheet and such if you want.


I'll make a .diff in a bit for those who are interested. I have a few 
minor things to finish off. :)

Hmm, seems like a lotta work when you coulda just copied the login 
form's HTML into a WP Page and had it post to wp-login.php. No core 
modifying needed and it'd look exactly the same...

And the register and login links can even be pointed at your Pages via a 
plugin and 2 filters.

Really, any link in the footer "let(s) you use my website
for your gain".  Whether it's to the theme designer, wordpress, or an ad.
It's always up to the user to decide whether to retain the link or not.
Trying to use the footer to promote your own blog will only get you knocked
off technorati, so a sponsorship link that proclaims itself as such doesn't
seem like an evil alternative.  

And considering that the theme is GPL, not linkware, there's no reason that
you can't remove the link, rather than banning the theme.  You're trying to
prove a point to theme authors who put ad links in their footer, but you're
taking it out on users who just want you to upload the theme and remove the
link.
And we are talking about wordpress.COM here, where automattic is already
running their adsense on top of users' blogs.  Whatever people think about
theme authors advertising on your content, is completely off-topic here.

After 18 months, you'd think that water was way under that bridge...

Have you thought that perhaps Matt and others have listened to the
feedback and are more careful about commercialization because of it?
Hence the concern now?

Live and let live is quite a bit different from "let you use my website
for your gain".

Live and let live means (in this case) don't do anything to stop you
from putting your ads wherever you want in your theme.

But that also means I don't have to use your theme and Matt doesn't have
to promote it.

Perhaps, but not everyone is a css junky.  Many want the ease of use
of a typical plugin.  I have in the past done exactly what you've
suggested, and it works well.

I wanted a plugin that used the theme of the existing site, would work
for most people, and it wasn't a lot of work anyway.  Plus, if people
want to style it they can.

Gotta agree with both points.  Never have heard a peep about the default 
blogroll links.  At the same time, someone develops a theme with a link, let 
them!  It's one thing to be open source, it's another thing to think that

BTW, just got a rush of hackers emails through, and wanted to update my 
statement. :)

I think 'hiding ads in plain view' is bad, without the mentioned caveats 
prior to download that Matt and others have mentioned.  But a link back to 
the author's site would be a different story -- I thought that's where the 
conversation was going (i.e., author's shouldn't put links in at all, 
shouldn't benefit in the slightest...), and obviously disagree with that 
extreme. ;)

Barthelme is my theme, so I should sound off here.

Podz suggested posting the following on the download page for my sponsored
themes:

"This theme has a sponsored link which you are free to remove" would be better
> surely? Telling the blogger and allowing them to make a considered
> decision - or would telling the blogger have them removing the link?

I think this is a fine suggestion. At first I had assumed that the comment
with the sponsored link (which others noted here was reasonable and
GPL-friendly, and essentially said "Delete the sponsor's link if you like")
would be sufficient. And it sure was. I received a number of emails from
users who said, essentially, "I saw your note in the footer and I deleted
the sponsored link. OK?" and it always was.

Also, directly above the download link to my themes there is licensing
information and the following statement: "Please feel free to alter this
theme in any way that pleases you. All I ask is that you allow my original
design credit to remain."

However! being resonable, I see that placing a note in the statement above
could not possible be harmful at all, and instead act as yet another layer
of assurance that, yes, my themes are all GPL, and yes, please feel free to
change them as you like. So up it goes. Thanks, Podz.

Of course Barthelme could on WordPress.com without the sponsored link. If I
had been emailed as the consideration was in progress, I would have
initiated the suggestion that, well duh, that link should probably go. I
don't think it's such a good idea to make an example of Barthelme as a "bad
theme" because it has a text link ad in it.

The consideration should be, does this theme benefit WordPress.com users,
and if so, how can we make it available to them? I am disappointed in the
possibility that the badness of the downloadable version of Barthelme
outweighs the goodness of a text-link-free version might have to
wp.comcommunity.

I have spoken.

Also, it should be noted that I know nothing about nothing.

Thank you for your time.

scott

The  blogroll  is a well-deserved reward that  benefits  the
owners of the linked sites /directly/.

One  of  the  gains  of participating in  Free  Open  Source
project  is recognition. No-one is here to deny this. It is,
to  an  extent, the /raison d'etre/ and source of drive  for
projects  such as Apache, from an historical perspective  at
least.  Links  to  one's  site  grant  recognition   whereas
advertisement  are intended solely for financial gain. That,
I  must admit, I find a tad 'over the line'. I have read the
very  reasonable response from the theme's creator and I can
agree with many of the points made. However:

The  gain from the links may be better off distributed among
lower  levels of the stack, e.g. WordPress developers. I  am
not  surprised  to  find that folks like  smallmouse  (David
House)  are rarely around here anymore. If only more  people
bother to reward the giants whose shoulders they stand upon.
It's  like  non-GPL-compliant Linux  distributions  (notably
Mepis/SimplyMEPIS)  that  build upon the success of  another
(leeching),   e.g.  CentOS,  without  necessarily  having  a
healthy  state of reciprocity. And while Red Hat is a mature
and successful company, not all is fine and jolly. Look, for
example,  at Canonical (geared up towards a business sector)
and their messed-up relationship with the Debian project.

The  only 'beep' I recall with regards to the blogroll  goes
over  a  year  back. It was a mild tiff that  involved  Mike
Little.

Money  made through FOSS is not black money. However, I fear
that  by encouraging embedment of link in a stealthy manner,
WordPress  may, by offering a precedence case, fall into the
class  of software that manipulates the user for self  gain.
There  are  many examples of such projects and you find  one
every  day  in  the  technology section.  This  varies  from
spyware to lockins.

I   think  it's  important  for  Autommatic  to  police  the
community  every  now  and  then.  WordPress  has  excellent
reputation  which  is improves by the day owing to  word  of
mouth.  This  can  easily  be ruined by  a  bunch  of  shady
headlines,  e.g.  Waxy and Scoble's "WordPress Sucks".  It's
not  always  a case of disinformation. Lenience  can  permit
WordPress  to  evolve into a malicious monster that  it  was
never intended to be (e.g. IE5/6), not by design anyway.

Best wishes,

Roy

And, oddly enough, barthalme has a similar means of changing _some_ of the
footer content, though not the link to wordpress, plaintxt, and fresh
flowers.

Perhaps the compromise could be to put the link to fresh flowers as the
default text for the editable footer?  Although it could be equally
suggested that wordpress and plaintxt links should go in there as well.

I think that Rob Miller's "Now Reading" plugin is an excellent example
of how to do this correctly.  It would be a shame for it to be pulled
from any plugin list.  His plugin links to Amazon for the purchasing of
the books you've added to your "library".  His configuration page has a
field where you can fill in your own Amazon ID or, as it states, you can
leave his as a way to say thank you for the plugin.  It is a well
organized discrete technique and I did leave his code in there for
several weeks when I started using that plugin.

There are definate right ways and wrong ways to go about this...

I'd like to correct that. I'm rather consistent at sharing my hacks and

a few candidate security holes recently.

Concept:
Authors wishing to be listed in the official repository must build their
themes to an accepted minimum standards (whatever is deemed appropriate.)
Authors include full metadata about the themes, including, but not limited
to, licence of distribution, version number, support site/forum links,
inclusion of links. Even how to remove any ads or links if allowed would be
good.
Themes are then sorted accordingly, and when community members are browsing,
they will know exactly which themes are GPL, which are linkware, shareware
or whateverware.
If the author does not supply the minimum metadata, then their themes are
simply not added, and they get a polite, generic reply to their application
stating why the theme will not be included.

I think WP has a lot to gain by making all options available and visible to
people, and if WP as an "organization" makes it easy to find these
resources, and ensures that users know what they are getting, then it
benefits everyone.

I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this.

+1 for this, time ago i proposed in other list (polyglots) and during
a IRC weekly meeting to have a sort of "WP Quality Ribbon" fotr theme
and plugins that meets some standards (i pushed for
internationalization too).

The only problme i see is who will care to check and certify this? I
can voluunteer for this and i think some other will do.

My  apologies  for  the  inaccuracies, Denis.  I  have  been
following  this  WordPress-related  project and  was  merely
using  its memory to support exemplify cases of  controversy
--  those that stir the community up. If I recall correctly,
everything  was settled at the end and everyone was pleased.
*smile*

In  general,  I  think  that any shakeup  in  any  community
(either  developer  community or users community)  paints  a
grim picture that makes a project's vocation seem uncertain.
In  accordance,  people choose software which  they  believe
will  have a long 'support rope'. That, for example, is  the
reason  for damaged reputation among the Debian team,  which
lost valued members and leaders. Character (or friction) was
a main drive, as opposed to technical issues [1].

Best wishes,

Roy

If we have folks who would be willing to check and maintain quality of 
themes, maybe it's time to resurrect the idea of a wp-themes.org repository?

The main reason I think it didn't work before where wp-plugins has taken 
off is that theme authors had a really hard time getting their heads 
around SVN.

Thanks for the concern Petit, but I mentioned it because I know the
background.  I'll explain it a bit more for you.

The point of the reference was to highlight the similarity of the
blood-in-the-water attitude toward the theme author, Scott, to the
blood-in-the-water attitude of the blogosphere toward Matt once upon a time
(even though what Scott did was exponentially more trivial).  Everybody puts
a link in their theme, because a little Google Juice is generally the only
benefit of creating a WordPress style.

To Roy's point, there's obviously some hypocrisy involved too, but I
certainly didn't fault Matt then, and don't fault Scott now.

Cheers,

I'm not a theme developer (though I have designed a few for clients and
hacked others themes), however, I'd be willing to volunteer for QC regarding
the above mentioned repository.  It sure would be nice to have a
couple of "official" locations for themes and the like.

I'd also be willing to try to work
with theme authors regarding SVN.  It'll be a good exercise because
I'm just starting on SVN myself so I have the "new user" perspective.
It seems pretty straight forward from what I can tell so far.

Probably cause lot of theme developpers are more design centric and
less programming centric than plugin developpers, but cause we plan to
certify the themes the SVN stuff can be managed by the people that
care for quality control.

I first did a *html blah { }, but that didn't fix it in IE7.

If anyone else can find a better solution, I'm all ears. I hated to have 
to go that route. The problems is that it looks really funky right now 
in the latest SVN and I think this is better than having it broken. :/

Oh, and just so anyone doesn't get the wrong idea -- no, I didn't come 
up with this new blue styled login page. It's been in the core for quite 
a while and was brought over from WordPress.com (I think). My 
ticket/patch is just improving (IMO) upon what was previously added. ;)

I'm not sure this is improvement enough.  I believe many, including
myself, would like to be able incorporate my login/registration/forgot
password forms directly into my theme, as I'm doing on jameskelly.org.

As far as I can tell, I still have to override the whole thing should
I wish to fully integrate it with my theme.

It's not browser sniffing, though? I'd much rather have a conditional 
comment for IE, so that IE-specific stuff only gets downloaded by IE, 
than bloat all of the CSS with hacks.

I agree, I think that browser specific stylesheets are a great way to  
handle this. It keeps the main stuff clean and only burdens browsers  
that don't behave properly. *Much* better than mucking up the CSS  
with a bunch of hacks.

This is different from browser sniffing in the sense that Robert is thinking of, and is best practices per the CSS list.  The manta is "design for the standard, then add IE exceptions/hacks as necessary".  It's the compromise between the ideal and, erm, Microsoft.

That's generally frowned upon since it requires browser-sniffing (which is
bad).
	
"Hacking" doesn't always have a negative connotation.  Hacks to handle
browser-specific exceptions are well-known and well-documented, and
generally add only a few bytes to a stylesheet.  The CSS wiki also points to
(sometimes tricky) ways to avoid browser-specific CSS hacks.

I agree, browser-sniffing, by way of checking the User Agent and such, is
a Bad Thing(tm), but that's not what's being done in this case.

>From the patch:
+       <!--[if IE]><style type="text/css">#login h1 a { margin-top: 35px;
} #login ul { padding-bottom: 65px; }</style><![endif]--><!-- Curse you,
IE! -->

In Safari, Firefox, Oprah, etc... this is just a pair of normal, well
formed, HTML comments.  In Internet Explorer, however, it parses it and
includes the extra style tag.

No browser sniffing involved.  All clients get the same data, they just
process it differently.

Cheers,
Mike

Actually, i don't think the conditional tags are "hacks." Even the IE team
at Microsoft suggested their use to target only IE or specific versions of
IE (namely when IE 7 is released, you don't want hacks that were for IE 6
there too).

Now you are getting into semantics. One person's hacks are another person's
workarounds are another person's SOP. :)

That's certainly true in general, but in this case browser-specific workarounds are really just considered "hacks" because In An Ideal World CSS would be supported perfectly and completely by every browser (which of course will never happen).  They were once hacks, but now are SOP.

To sanity-check CSS techniques for "correctness" I can't recommend the CSS list highly enough.  The experts there will have no qualms tearing you a new one if you do something stupid.   :^)

Just copy/paste in the HTML results (not the PHP) of the form onto a 
Page of your theme and have it POST to wp-login.php. No hacking required 
and it should accomplish the exact same thing.

I could add some hooks though for above and below the forms so you could 
load up your theme, but it'd be kinda ugly to pull off.

My only concerns are aesthetic really. I think it looses its umph by being
as wide as it is, and while I'm all for larger input fields for the login
screen, I think they are too large. And finally the Login button is also too
big and still uses the old-school WordPress style, which is horrendous :)

But I'm biased.

Subject: [wp-hackers] remove a category name from the internal rewrite rules?
Message-ID: <4506B276.70208@plumlee.org>

I browsed through the support forums and thought this might be a little 
too involved for there, so I'm trying here.

I use wordpress as a CMS for our site (which has worked superbly, the 
flexibility is excellent).  We run some monthly specials, and I use the 
category of 'specials' to indicate an item is on sale and to replace the 
price with the sale price along with some other trickery.

I didn't realize when I set up my permalinks using categories and post 
name that I would be creating a problem.  When I add an item to the 
'specials' category, the permalink changes because the 'specials' 
category is one of the lowest numbered categories, lower than the normal 
category of the item.  So instead of the permalink being 
'/itemcategory/itemname', it's '/specials/itemname'.

I considered changing the category number of 'special' to something like 
9999 and then resetting the auto increment setting to start at a lower 
number. But before I do that, I'm wondering if it's possible to exclude 
certain categories from the internal rewrite rules, in effect hiding 
those categories from the process that creates the permalink.  If anyone 
has another idea about how to do this, I'd be interested.

Filtering out the category is going to be nasty.

You could hack get_permalink to ignore the "special" category with a check
on the id of the category select.

Do you use the "special" category for anything but marking things as special?

Could you use post meta attributes instead - thereby using the meta
information on a post to do all the funky stuff you want to do.

Hacking the get_permalink might be the best way, hadn't thought that 
simply.  :)

I would normally use the custom fields, but the person who handles 
putting things in the specials is not technical enough to handle that 
without getting a lesson each time.

Instead of hacking it, use the 'post_link' filter it applies right
before returning the permalink, to change the permalink for those
posts in the "special" category.  It should be pretty straightforward,
as that filter gets passed both the permalink and the $post object.

Even better.  I had started looking at the get_permalink and wasn't too 
excited about trying to figure out the best way to get the first 
'non-special' category (I should have elaborated, we have several such 
categories that serve different purposes).  Thanks for the idea.

get_the_category($post->ID) should return an array of the categories.

Mmm, I like that one as well.

I didn't really change the look of the login form at all though. I just 
mostly changed the stuff behind the scenes. ;)

Message-ID: <af0a550f0609140010h57fcb987xc97c6ffd7ab09459@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I was wondering if I could make a plugin that will run automatically.
Something like a cron job. Let me give you an example.

I want to be able to retrieve data form a site say delicious and post
them in a regular post every day, week or 2 weeks (whatever). But the
catch is I don't want this to be a hack I want a plugin. Meaning I
activate it provide with some details and that's it, everything is
done for me.

My question is if there is any hook in wp that will allow such
operation. Of course this can be used in many ways such as "improve"
the backup plugin to be run automatically.

Somewhere I did a patch that lets you toggle between RTE/quicktags. It
requires the RTE to be switched on in the profile because otherwise
the required js is not loaded. It would be possible to code it so the
RTE can be flicked on during an edit. This probably should be done.

However it should always remain a per-user option settable on another
page; I've seen certain instances of IE6 regularly crash by TinyMCE
until it was switched off.

Or, if you can wait for WP 2.1, pseudo cron is in the core.

+1

I would *love* to see this abstracted into a plugin. Sure, include the
plugin by default and even activated by default if need be, but I
think having TinyMCE totally self-contained in a plugin so that we can
completely disable or even permanently delete it would be super slick.
Surely that would satisfy the power users as well as give the
"regular" users the RTE that their hearts so desire.

I think it'd be interesting to see some stats from WP.com on how many
active users are actually using TinyMCE as opposed to the quicktags
interface.

Maybe so, but I was just throwing it out there since I've seen Matt
share several varieties WP.com stats. I'll overlook the fact that you
just compared Automattic to AOL... Sheesh.

Sorry, sacred cow?  And I compared wordpress.com to aol, just so we're
clear.  ;-)

Yeah, I used the daily blog posting for a little. It worked fine, although
the UI on del.icio.us is a little... rough? (You'll see what I'm talking
about if you choose to use it)

SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM `wp_usermeta` WHERE `meta_key` = 'rich_editing'

190497

That's how many people have a set preference.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `wp_usermeta` WHERE `meta_key` = 'rich_editing' AND 
`meta_value` = 'true'

183995

So about 6500 people turned it off, I'd say that 10% of them are from 
this list. :)

Then again, this -is- WordPress.com. Drawing conclusions from that
number for users of Wordpress itself is a bit... not smart, heh.
WordPress.com is somewhat targeted at beginners, so they'll logically
have RTE on. Wordpress itself and the people who use it are different
in that respect, imho.

These are good things and I've seen some such plugins out there. Are
they maintained any better than the core editor?

Considering how much grief RTE gives me whenever I check to see if it's
ready for prime-time yet, I find it hard to believe anyone leaves it on,
but that's just me.

I did.  I performed a three day experiment using the Daily Post
Formatting plugin
(http://www.el73.be/drunkey-love/2006/01/19/ddpf-plugin-11/) and found
that the signal-to-noise ratio was way too low, so much so that I was
annoying MYSELF as much as my readers.

Which causes me to wonder how many of those who DON'T turn it off even know
that:
A) They CAN turn it off.
B) They know HOW to turn it off and
C) There is an alternative available to them.

Fair enough.

However people on this list who are turning it off because it's "buggy" 
are missing the point.

How many trac tickets have you filed before you turn it off? We should 
be fixing the bugs, not ignoring them.

We need to make writing as easy as humanly possible, and get out of the 
user's way as much as possible. For non-coders -- which is the bulk of 
the .com and .org audience -- this means no angle brackets.

That's roughly 3% of the users with a recorded preference. And if the
'rich_editing' meta_key isn't there for all users, 3% is actually a high
estimate for the whole user base.

Just for fun, I did an inner join on that second result set with: 

"SELECT * FROM `wp_usermeta` WHERE `meta_key` = 'the_meaning_of_rich_text'
AND `a_clue` = 'true'"

And got "No result returned". 

Interesting!

I still think more people would know they could turn it off if it was
under Options >> Writing. But that's just me, that, you know, thinks
putting Options under the Options menu makes sense.

Options->Writing requires admin privileges.  RTE is a personal 
preference that anyone should be able to change.  That said, the 
personal prefs are rather hidden away in the profile.

Or add it to the Write Panel, as originally suggested in this thread,
which is viewed WAAAAY more than the "profile."

Fair enough.

That they are, but we still only have one. My other proposal from a
while back to fix this problem (and rid us of the dbx on the write
page) was to have a link from the Write page that lets users customize
their view. Sortof like sidebar widgets, users would individually
choose what boxes should be shown to the right of the editing area,
and which editor they would like to use. It'd let us keep all the drag
and drop goodness, but remove it from the Write page where it is a
hassle and an annoyance since state is not saved across browsers or
machines, whereas this new approach would be. I posed this before on
hackers, but never got much of a response, and so I'll open this as
another thread (hopefully this worked right) and see if we can get
some responses this time around.

I think that's not the "write" answer either. (groan...)

Blogger does this well, there is just a tab to the top-right of the 
writing area which switches inline from plain-text to HTML instantly.

I guess most users of WordPress, outside of .com, are one person blogs, 
but I still think the option of using RTE, should be per user.
A check box for the option directly on the "write post" page would be 
good though.
Couldn't that option set a cookie?

I second that.

The current WYSIWYG editor is buggy as hell and horror to use for big editing tasks. I keep it switched off by default on all my blogs. You can read my experiences here:
http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/

I was also writing a plugin for a client which inserts some text into the WYSIWYG editor and realized to my horror that it has strange browser specific bugs which are extremely hard to overcome.

It may not be a proper evaluation as most WordPress.com users are unlikely to even know how to (or even that they can) turn it off. 

Can you exclude blogs with less than 2 posts in your stats.

SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM `wp_usermeta` WHERE `meta_key` = 'rich_editing'

190497

That's how many people have a set preference.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `wp_usermeta` WHERE `meta_key` = 'rich_editing' AND 
`meta_value` = 'true'

183995

So about 6500 people turned it off, I'd say that 10% of them are from 
this list. :)

Fair criticism. I have blogged about it and turned it off. However I haven't reported any bugs thinking that they were so obvious surely dozens must have already reported them. I will soon report several I have found.

I agree with you. Also TinyMCE is a fair choice to start with. However in my brief excursion into the TinyMCE integration I felt the design was lacking in quite some aspects. I wouldn't mind elaborating if there is an interest on this topic.

Fair enough.

However people on this list who are turning it off because it's "buggy" 
are missing the point.

How many trac tickets have you filed before you turn it off? We should 
be fixing the bugs, not ignoring them.

We need to make writing as easy as humanly possible, and get out of the 
user's way as much as possible. For non-coders -- which is the bulk of 
the .com and .org audience -- this means no angle brackets.

Why not put it directly in write post & page tab?
People with a pain will know how to turn it off immediately :)
After all it is relevant for only those who can write a post / page, isn't it?

How about something like two check box:
[] Turn off WYSIWYG for this post
[] Turn off WYSIWYG for all your posts & pages

Ooo - ouch... Sorry man...  I've yet to hear of a chance were anyone's
raid system saved them from a faulty drive.  I'm sure it happens.  Cool
hot swappable technology or not, I've heard of four raid systems going
bad - counting yours - and each time the whole array had to be rebuilt
from external backups.  Other than for speed benefits, I'd feel safer
with a good backup regimen.  

For recent posts, if you were setup to send complete articles, you'd
probably be better asking your rss subscribers to send you what they've

Strange coincidence, I lost all the data on my VPS last night when a
RAID array died.

Ok. Now in my experience, RAID is now 0-5 in recovering from failures.

That's not a bad thought.

Owen, I think my Liferea cache has your 100 most recent posts - don't
think it cached images, unfortunately, but there's a fair chance that
I could help out in recovering a bit of the HTML side of your content.

I couldn't agree more on that. I don't run into many problems with TinyMCE
(although I use the Editor Monkey plugin), but I do get tired of having to
reset my DBX boxes on every different computer I post from. It would be nice
to incorporate an ajax method on the dbx state and store it as user meta.

I  can't  help but think of Poz's story. He too lost  pretty

A  similar  proposal  was  made  not so  long  age.  It  was
suggested   that   the  dashboard  should   be   made   more
customisable  and adopt the concept of widgets. I don't know
if  this was implemented or not, but anything that makes the
interface  more 'fluid', or adaptable to the user's need  as
they involve, would have merit.

Uh, ok.  :)

Yes, the server is pretty dead.  I guess the RAID card fried a bunch of 
the drives that were connected to it.  I don't blame Unixshell for my 
inability to restore backups I don't have, and I should have known 
better than to trust only their snapshot system.  Getting the new VPS 
running is another question, however.

I'm not sure what all I have backups of, specifically the code for 
RedAlt.  Not a lot has changed since the backup I know I have (from 
March), but I'm not sure what the status of the function reference is 
for the moment.

I've recovered the blog posts that weren't backed up from Bloglines, 
where I hadn't read anything since the last backup.  All 175 posts.  :)

I'm hoping to get some things back online today and over the weekend. 
Once again, use the misfortunes of someone you know to take the time to 
verify the workings of your backup plan.

Thanks to everyone for the kind thoughts.

Owen

I  know  I  can  offer no advice that is  genuine  (and  yet
unheard  of).  However, I have learned from  some  miserable
experiences  that  one  should store all all  files  in  2/3
separate  (and  preferably distant) sites. There  are  tools
that  automate  much  of this and a one-time  investment  of
time/money  is  worthwhile as it stays with you forever.  To
speak  from  personal  experiece (hope you  don't  mind  the
rambling):

I primarily use rsync (the bandwidth-efficient way) and scp.
It's  possible  to  make complete copies of  the  hard-drive
every  night,  along  with  a stack of  snapshots  to  avoid
'contamination'.  It helps me sleep better at night, as well
as use wildcards. *smile*

The  problem  (and biggest enemy) is that  with  complacency
comes  greed to be lenient and too trustworthy, which is why
I  *force* myself, using a calendar, to do particular backup
tasks  (and I still get sloppy on occasions). The routine is
mostly  scripted (as much as possible), but it needs  sanity
checks  (I'm doing one at this very moment). Procrastination
is  an  enemy and that's only ever realises if when you  say
"if only I had been more careful, I would have lost 1 day of
work  instead of a week, or a month". In my case, a disaster
last  stroke  two weeks ago when I broke my Firefox  profile
(third-party extension). It took hours to restore and it was
overall  lossy. Another possibility that I take advantage of
(in case of 'contamination' on the server) is mysqldump as a
cron job on the Web server, or a stack thereof.

Be  sure  to  check your browser cache for the  very  latest
posts.  Another  backup procedure worth having is  a  nighly
wget  of  the front page. There have been cases in the  past
where  recent  items  somehow got b0rked,  so  the  snapshot
proved to be useful in recovery.

It  happens  to all of us. It's only a question of:  1)  how
often;  2) how severe; 3) recoverable/lossy/irreversible; 4)
how  we  handle  this emotionally. I think of data  loss  as
though  it's a mild analogy of recurring illness or the loss
of  a  loved  one... but data and blog posts are  the  least
terrible thing that can happen, so we must be lucky.


> Thanks to everyone for the kind thoughts.


Good to hear from you again.

Nice site and good practices even if it is a sales gimmick, it's a good
one..  It took me a little bit to realize the yin/yan symbols were arrows.
I've emailed them about the 404.  Yeah, I'm more of the "Jesus Saves. So
should you."  Persuasion myself. ;)

Somewhat related, at our wedding reception, each table had a balloon
containing a note with task that the guests at that table must complete.
One of the written "Ten Commandments of Marriage" was "Thou shalt not format
thine husband's hard drive in a fit of anger.".  I was glad to have that
established early, but I still back up to DVD just in case. :)

Aha, you're on unixshell just like I am, and on the same VM. What a
shame, I lost some very important things. I'm still praying they can
restore at least the snapshots that I had, even though it was from
long, long ago.

While I agree that it would be cool to be able to theme the login &
registration forms, it seems as though this is a good step forward all on
its own.

Theme-able content for the forms could come next?

This should be a warning to anyone using an unmanaged server of any sort... 
Back up off-server yourself, whether paying the host to do it, or doing it 
yourself.  Don't 'trust' in any 'snapshot' backups in the hosting package 
unless they are expressly defined as off-server or off-site.

I think Matt@unixshell/tektonic has unfortunately tried to offer amazing 
cut-rate VPS service, not factoring in support overhead -- i.e., planning 
and consideration of an 'unmanaged' bullet-proof backup system (i.e., you 
NEVER back up data to the same drive(s) as the original source data).  He's 
continued to get higher demand for his cool services, but this is one of the 
'costs' of a small/one-man show (I don't know for a fact he's one-man, but I 
believe he started that way -- and most cut-rate companies are basically 
remote sysadmins!)

I don't necessarily blame unixshell.  I mean, failed hardware is failed 
hardware -- at that point, I'd start making RAID hardware manufacturers hold 
some kind of 'insurance' policy on card failures that destroy data. ;)  And, 
unixshell/Matt is VERY upfront that it's an extremely-unmanaged system. ;)

OTOH, a host is a host.  You can say you don't charge enough to really 
support folks, and that's how you keep things so cheap, but the moment 
something like this happens EVERYONE on the system realizes that a few bucks 
apiece, per month, to cover a teeny bit of 'support overhead' for disaster 
planning, would be well worth it.  If the plan promises backups, they 
shouldn't be on the same box -- hardware failures happen, don't rely on RAID 
to save your ass. ;) ;)

To Owen: if you need any help from the community, please ask!

I don't know, but I can't imagine it would be all that complicated to
get it working again. It's not a huge patch.

Messing with post content is a very sensitive operation. I had to
clone wpautop in js and this is not well tested with complex HTML. So
it needs testing. It also needs an interface (a tabbed editor would be
fine).

Sorry, no more cookies, I promise ;)
I lost my logic for a while there, and forgot about the "you should be 
logged in to write" pattern.
The user db is a good place, but I still believe the switch should be on 
the Write Post page, which is logical and accessible.
( I guess, in the background there is a cookie supporting the session, 
and the "remember me" thingy ;)

Definitely a good wake-up call. I have a laptop that I leave running
almost all the time now; I've just set up a cron to dump my DBs and
then sync the whole folder down to local.

Of course, the funny thing is that I'm using about 2 GB of my 80 at
Dreamhost, and I'm using locally about 70 GB of my 80 GB drive... I
really should just be syncing them *both* ways.

Did I miss the part where someone suggested wrapping the editor in a div 
and using Ajax to swap it out for the alternate version containing the 
appropriately formatted content?  I mean, if you're going to run 
TinyMCE, you're going to be Ajax-capable anyway.

On-the-fly swapping is the way to go.  Blogger and Gmail do this pretty 
well.

Yeah, I just noticed Gmail's "Plain text" and "Rich text" buttons. I think
the AJAX method is a good idea. Uses AJAX in a constructive way, rather than
just for the heck of it.

Storing it in per user settings in the database is the best way to go IMHO.

Cookies are unreliable and people clean their cookies and can even set it to clean automatically on browser shutdown in Firefox.

On a different note everyone seems to be referring to "dbx boxes". What are they?
Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dbx ) couldn't shed light on it in the context it is used in this mailing list.

FWIW, that can be fixed with a plugin. Here's one I put together just
to see how hard it would be.
  <http://rephrase.net/box/word/dbx-save/dbx-save.phps>

It uses AJAX and dodgy object prototype replacement to save the dbx
state to usermeta whenever the cookie is updated. Not well-tested but
works for me. (Using 2.0.4.)

Ok, so I lost a drive on one of my 3ware RAIDs about two years ago.
I replaced the drive (with a larger one -- couldn't find the same old
small size anymore) and the RAID rebuilt happily and everything still
works today.

Just to even the score a bit ... :)  (Also, seems to have been the case
that Owen's and Robert's RAIDs were the exact same one.)

It's already a per-user setting.  That will be maintained.  Those who

Here's a tiny patch (to WP2.0) that adds an action 'user_options_update',
equivalent to 'personal_options_update'. It's called when administrator edits
user details, useful for storing metadata in extra forms added via
show_user_profile and edit_user_profile. Can't see an equivalent in 2.1 (yet).

 * Is 'user_options_update' a good name?
 * Should I just be recycling 'personal_options_update'?

(As the method for getting the user_id to update differs, a different action may
be indicated).

I've lost count of how many drives I've replaced in RAID arrays over the
years. Never lost an array yet. But this is dependent on the hardware being
up to the job. And I still have tape backups of every system I manage. Tapes
in various sets kept in a fire safe and in a bank vault. Snapshots to disk
are a valid method of backup, so long as they're not on the same hardware,
and ideally not in the same building. As far as my personal WP sites go, I
have wp-backup email me my database every day. Automated backups are much
better than ones you have to remember to get round to....

Toggling the editor on the write page won't affect the persistent 
setting?  I'm not saying it should, but I'm interested in hearing ideas 
on why it should/should not.

I don't think it should. If you choose not to have it on, I'd rather
not have to wait for all of TinyMCE to load just so that I could
switch it back on on-the-fly.If its off, its off. If its on, well, I
guess you can switch it on the fly? I'm still not sure why we're
switching on the fly, but I say if its off, its off.

Perhaps I'll clarify with a list-

Option A: Editor loads based on user page option.  Regardless of loaded 
editor, toggle on write page allows switching to other editor.  The 
toggled state is not used to change the user page option.

Option B: Regardless of the loaded editor, the toggle on write page 
allows switching to other editor.  The toggled state changes the stored 
preference so that subsequent loads use the toggled state.  There is no 
user page option.

Option C: Editor loads based on user page option.  Only TinyMCE allows 
toggling to a textarea editor.  This toggle does not change the user 
page option.

There are sure to be a few other combinations, but these few are what I 
considered sane.  What are the pros and cons of each?

Eliminating an obscurely located user option checkbox and simplifying 
the concept of what happens when you toggle the editor leads me to 
believe Option B is a good choice.  Your thoughts?

I could become a large fan of just about any of these.  Option B appeals the
most.  I look forward to removing the phrase "Go to Options -> Users, scroll
all the way to the bottom of the page and toggle the "visual rich editor""
from my copy/paste WP Support phrases.  :-)

I won't mind this, if it can be done in a way where TinyMCE is not
loaded if my option states I want the regular editor (afaik, nobody
has done this in a way where TinyMCE isn't loaded normally with the
rest of the JS; and the UI is _extremely_ unobtrusive, the Write page
is crowded as it is). Otherwise, I'd rather see C.

I think the best route would be similar to option B, but also allowing an
option in the Profile or whatever that totally turns off the loading of
TinyMCE (ie - it isn't even an option). 

The one problem I do see with the tinyMCE/html area switching is how tinyMCE
cleans the html code. You can write a full page and then click on the view
html button and you get a single line of code. If someone changes midstream
(similar to Blogger), then they would switch back to some highly condensed
HTML. Also this would apply to someone trying to do something such as
embedding video, such as YouTube, as TinyMCE totally hacks that code up to
the point it doesn't work. I don't know if there is an option that can be
set in TinyMCE to prevent that or not.

I've already resigned myself to not getting what I want (option D - no 
TinyMCE, heh) because it's probably not in the best interests of 
WordPress users at large.  I expect to be able to write a plugin that 
removes the TinyMCE script tag from the write page if it's never used.

Are our Ajax libraries robust enough to handle script execution that 
includes TinyMCE?  In other words, if you have the editor set to come up 
as a text area, then you hit the toggle, can it not only replace the 
textarea but add the additional TinyMCE support script?

Prototype has script execution features for this sort of thing, but all 
of the script is evaluated, so you can't declare functions normally, you 
have to write them as:

myfunction = function(...) {...}

I doubt TinyMCE's code looks like this, and I'm not sure what happens if 
you just dump script tags into the replaced HTML.  Nothing?  Bedlam?

There would also need to be a check for TinyMCE to make sure that it 
doesn't load twice if the area was toggled twice.  ("Let's see if the 
WYSIWYG editor can do something here...  Oh, that's no good switch 
back...  What's all this HTML in my textarea???...  Oh, crap, two 
TinyMCEs.")

Perhaps a better solution would be to make TinyMCE the full-time default 
for supported browsers, and then plug in its removal either entirely or 
by added options somewhere.  /me waits for upheaval.

I still say moving it out of the core to a bundled plugin activated by
default would be nice. That would mean I could just deactivate it and
remove the wp-content/plugins/tinymce/ directory and be done with it.

That is one of the reasons I went with the EditorMonkey plugin (which is no
longer being maintained). When I have set up a few sites, I have disables
the core TinyMCE by default then put this plugin in - that way they can
easily turn it off if they want. That and it gives a lot more
functions/plugins to the editor as compared to the basic WP TinyMCE.

For what it's worth, I still agree with this. I think users that want to 
switch between TinyMCE and the regular text box on the fly are a very 
small minority; why make things needlessly complex?

The plugin idea is even simpler and more efficient than the existing 
behaviour; it caters for those who want to keep the RTE--probably the 
majority--and is easier for those who want just a regular textarea.

I am in favor of option B. Additionally I think the editor should be implemented as a plugin, as others suggested. The plugin will obviously use filters & hooks to implement the functionality. So it will be easier to swap it with something better and more stable. Users will have more choice.

The user page option is pretty well hidden away from normal users.

Perhaps I'll clarify with a list-

Option A: Editor loads based on user page option.  Regardless of loaded 
editor, toggle on write page allows switching to other editor.  The 
toggled state is not used to change the user page option.

Option B: Regardless of the loaded editor, the toggle on write page 
allows switching to other editor.  The toggled state changes the stored 
preference so that subsequent loads use the toggled state.  There is no 
user page option.

Option C: Editor loads based on user page option.  Only TinyMCE allows 
toggling to a textarea editor.  This toggle does not change the user 
page option.

There are sure to be a few other combinations, but these few are what I 
considered sane.  What are the pros and cons of each?

Eliminating an obscurely located user option checkbox and simplifying 
the concept of what happens when you toggle the editor leads me to 
believe Option B is a good choice.  Your thoughts?

Owen

The editor is already fairly pluggable.  Almost everything passes 
through a filter.

Click "My Profile". It's at the top (in 2.1 and on wordpress.com).

+1 on moving editor to a plugin, even having it default ACTIVE in a new 
install to accomodate average users over us techie types.  makes it easier 
to then replace with other competitive RTEs, and no hunting for how to 
disable it site-wide (i.e., just deactivate it! ;) ).

But that's a techie's opinion, someone who won't ever use the RTE bc I don't 
need it or want it, it causes headaches for most of my cool plugins, etc. ;)

I see two benefits to making it a plugin:

1) The TinyMCE plugin could more closely follow TinyMCE development,
so those who want the newest version wouldn't have to wait both for
someone to include updates in WP and for the release of the next WP
version: they'd just upload the newest version of the plugin.

2) It seems more in line with WordPress's philosophy of keeping core
code simple and web standards-compliant; TinyMCE is neither.

I'm not sure what evidence you have, but several people that I've set up WordPress want to easily switch between WYSIWYG and code views.  They eventually shut TinyMCE off only because it's so hard to switch back and forth.

An RTE is an essential core feature.  WP is worthless to most people 
without an RTE.  tinyMCE is our RTE, and it is tightly bundled by 
default.  If those on this list are unwilling to help make it better and 
want to drop in something of their own instead, hijack the filters that 
tinyMCE uses.  If we need to add filters anywhere to make this easier, 
send a patch.

I'll reiterate Matt's request.  Write specific bug reports to help make 
tinyMCE better.  Invest some time in making tinyMCE better for all of 
the people who rely on it. As it is, the only people who really 
contribute to its improvement are wp.com users.  Contribution from those 
on this list would be a welcome change.

I disagree. If WP was worthless to most people without an RTE, 1.2 and
1.5 would have been nowhere. Granted, it is a feature that many would
miss if it disappeared, however dropping it from the core into a
plugin that is bundled, officially supported, and activated by default
won't make a bit of difference to normal users. But for those of us
who want it gone, it makes all the difference. (For someone who said
you can disable it and delete the files, try hosting a multi-person
blog, where one user tries to reenable the option and wonders why
nothing happens. Just deleting the files isn't a solution. The bit in
the profile cannot be removed without output buffering the whole page,
which is nasty.

I think one of the fundamental problems with Matt's request is that
99.9% of the people on this list wouldn't want TinyMCE whether or not
it functioned perfectly, catered to their every whim,  and functioned
dually as their personal sex slave. I remain +1 for moving it to a
plugin, and still implementing whatever else you'd like.

Oh!  Sorry, I'm an idiot...I don't use TinyMCE, and I'd never noticed that little HTML button before I re-enabled it just now.  The blind (me) leading the blind (them)...  <slapping forehead>

If we didn't add it in 2.0, we would not have broadened our audience. 
wordpress.com certainly would not have the uptake it has has without it. 
  WYSIWYG and spellchecking are absolute requirements.  We had people 
turning away in large numbers until we had a spellchecker in tinyMCE.

We need folks willing to develop for people other than developers. 
Instead we get long threads over how to marginalize WordPress to serve 
developer tastes.

I'm against making it a plugin. It is pluggable without moving it into a 
plugin.  Some things are core, and tinyMCE is one of them. Having a 
"Deactivate" button next to a vital feature suggests that instead of 
developing that feature we just dumped it off to the side so that we 
could ignore it.

We have a lot invested in tinyMCE and none of the other RTEs are 
convincing enough to warrant a switch.  It provides a core feature and 
should be treated as core.  Those who don't like it already have options 
for turning it off or replacing it.

Sorry to oversimplify this but with any product the consumer decides. So if
WP (org or com or other) wants to be the product of choice (my vote) as a
web based communication medium (blog is too narrow a term) - then writing
has to be a no brainer.

In fact it has to be a simple as writing a MS Word (Openoffice if you are
offended) document.

An angled bracket is what people use for putting up shelves.

Coming in on this a bit late, but..

RE: The adding it to the Write Post section, sounds like a nice idea! Would 
make it so much simpler when trying to explain to the users on the forums, 
about where to go to turn it on or off.

However, if you're going to keep it, (please keep in mind, I didn't read any 
of the list discussion on this previously, busy with other stuff.) Make it 
OFF for default maybe...

After I had done over 30 WordPress installs for people already.. out of 
those 30, I left the RTE ON for one person, only to get an email later that 
their blog was screwed up. So, I went into their blog CP, cleaned up ALL 12 
posts, because they decided to copy/paste from something like MS WORD..

I know it's not "our" fault though, but..after handling support threads of 
"My blog's messed up! HELP!!" And it turns out they *usually* copy/pasting 
from a word processor, right into the RTE.. "we've" come to find out, they 
didn't know how to turn off the RTE, or they knew.. but didn't care about 
it...sigh. IMHO, If all possible.. maybe make it OFF for default.. and have 
it added in the Write Post window?

spencerp
p.s. If ya rip my head off, can I get it back before later today.. I'll need 
it then. ;) =P I just wanted to throw out my thoughts and such.. =)

Not so! I just downloaded it and it was like a dream come true! Just
when I'd been contemplating learning complex SQL for several hours it
did the job in a few clicks. Thanks! :)

Someone posted this on this list a few months back. It is still in beta, but
I and a few others have been using it and it works great.

http://uwmike.com/wordpress/wp-cats/

You can assign or remove a post from one or more cats via that manage screen
and it is all ajax based so it is nice and quick.

+1 for the idea as long as somehow tackles the design problem of  
handling multiple category assignments at once.

Example: I list most of my comics under the category of "comics" and  
the category of the comic title, so that my users can navigate by  
either. I'd love to be able to batch out category changes on the  
Manage Posts page, but I'm usually doing it because I accidentally  
assigned a bunch of comics to the "blog posts" category, which means  
I have to remove "blog posts" and assign "comics" and "comic title".

thx :)

Speaking of what should be core / what should not be, the  
functionality provided by this plugin is built into Movable Type, and  
I was really surprised to see that it wasn't in WP when I switched a  
year ago.  I'd love to see that functionality present in WP by default.

I'm the author of that plugin, and yeah, it sounds like pretty much
what you're looking for.

As far as I'm aware, it's now quite stable... the only big outstanding
request I've heard from a few people is to have an option for
cascading categories, and only loading sub-categories on the click.
(for those crazy folks with dozens of them in a big snarly
hierarchy...)

As for implementing in core, I'm another one of those big bad nasties
that would rather keep the core simple and just clean up and ship a
bunch of default plugins if it's felt that such functionality is
critical. I'll be the first to admit that the JavaScript in WP-Cats is
more than a little awkward; if such a thing were to end up in core, it
would need a once-over. (I'd rather see *all* Ajax enhancements done
in such a way that they're fully implemented via the plugin
interface... which should be possible given enough markup hooks and
REST-y methods)

Copy/paste from Word is very common, and something we should handle 
better. Thankfully, Word 2007 has a built-in blogging client which works 
well with WordPress and generates sane HTML.

Pressing ALT+B inside TinyMCE causes another toolbar to show on with
Built-in "Paste from Word" and "Paste as Plaint Text" buttons.

No need to remove RTE, just tell users this functionality and also make'em
aware about problem of pasting from Word.

Macromedi(Adobe) Dreamweaver has a great built-in functionality, It cleans
up MS Word HTML on the fly (on CTRL+V) and make them Valid XHTML. It would
be a nice feature to be added to TinyMCE.

It doesn't always generate great HTML. For some reason, images always botch
up when I try to use it. Don't know why. Maybe we should encourage use of
something like the Performancing Extension for firefox for people to use.

Examine the markup that PE for FF generates...

Ironically, the best client I've seen so far as far as markup and image
handling goes would be Windows Live Writer (beta).

How do I make this happen?  When trying from my own 2.0.4 blog, alt-B, in
Firefox, gets me a bookmarks menu...

Maybe integratign this plugin:

http://www.ndsinternet.com/blog/archives/2006/08/wordpress-plain-text-paste-plugin

into the WP/TinyMCE distro would be a greaat help for this problems.

You have to click into the RTE to give it focus and then press Alt+b.

When is 2.1 coming?  That one little thing, alone, will save so many wasted
hours in wp.org support that I'm almost in tears of giddy-ness.

I don't understand what the issue is.  A RAID 5 by its very nature is
pretty solid if set up correctly, especially with hardware arrays.

I've worked with many and NEVER had one corrupt in the event of hard
drive failure, especially with a hot spare in play.

I agree that all the forms should be "themeable".  That's why I
created the plugin located at
http://www.jameskelly.org/wordpress-plugins/custom-login-and-registration-forms-plugin/
which allows the user to include the login, registration, and forgot
password forms into their themes and includes the ability to set up
custom redirects.

Note that this is not a hack, I detest hacks causing me to have to keep
track of files changed.  This plugin overrides the forms completely
while using 99% of the core code within the plugin to reduce the
amount of security testing I had to do.

I intend to write this functionality into the trunk for consideration
at some point in the near future through the hook system; I just
wanted to let the dust settle on the latest changes first.

Message-ID: <236d6d6a0609180351m637431c0p5ef8a02b8f3c6e7c@mail.gmail.com>

WordPress Developers / Hackers --

As a plugin author it would be great if we could get a heads up (say a week)
before the launch of WP 2.1. The last few major WordPress versions have
borked my plugin to varying degrees, and I inevitably get an influx of mail
from my users. Having a heads up to make necessary plugin changes on a
near-final version of 2.1 would be great.

Is the current SVN in a close enough state to start testing my plugin? I'm
trying to avoid wasting work at this point -- but I also want to be able to
log bugs before 2.1 is completely locked down.

Thanks!

Good luck with that request. Doubtful it would ever happen.

Its never too early to start testing off SVN, and it'll likely make
your life easier if you track the changes and adjust gradually instead
of trying to fix the many areas it may break in all at once.

I made something similar as a plugin, but for Pages. You could get the
basics out of this one and apply it to Posts, methinks:

Ryan, I'm lost here! Like many here, I turned the darned thing off. In 
my case because I couldn't spell check with th Google bar spell checker. 
It completely destroys an post if I use TinyMCE. I was surprised to hear 
that it has a spell checker of its own, so I turned it on briefly to 
find that. I can't, but I may be blind, so please inform me! I'd be 
happy to use it if I could spell check.

Petit,

It appears as though this is going into 2.1.  I checked my 2.0.4 install
and, as you said, I couldn't see it.  Flipped over to my copy of trunk and
there it is (with a ABC+checkmark, as you'd expect).

Something must have happened. I use the WP ver. 2.04 and in my TinyMCE I
get the same result form Ctrl+B, Alt + B and Alt Gr + B, that is I get 
*bold* text..

I begin to wonder, what versions do you guys use?

NOP. Gives me bold text ( visibly activates the B button on the toolbar )

Ah, that explains it.
I thought it could be something like that ;)
In the support forum, I'll continue to say "Did you paste from word or 
such? then just don't!!"
It is bound to cause headaches, and it does.

Ryan said there would be a beta release at least a week before the  
launch.

Well, hopefully longer than that.  I want to do at least a couple of bug 
hunts after we go beta.  Before we had a rather lengthy, undefined beta 
period but didn't do much to motivate testing efforts.

Subject: [wp-hackers] giving original plugin author credit when altering code
Message-ID: <451009F3.8020101@plumlee.org>

Is there a de facto/approved/agreed upon/'hey, that works!' method for 
giving an original plugin author credit when extending his/her plugin?

I've got a couple of plugins that I love to use, but I sometimes make a 
couple of changes to them to tweak them exactly as I want.  I don't know 
if I should create a new plugin based off the original and give credit 
somehow, or just patch the plugin whenever a new version from the 
original author comes out.

Any preferences from plugin authors on the list? I've read this: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#Plugin_File_Structure, so 
I'm wondering if adding some sort of 'Original Plugin Name' line to give 
the correct credit.

A lot depends upon the license that people choose. If the original is
GPL'd, you do have to keep the original licensing terms and conditions
intact before redistributing the plugin.

Most I've seen have just listed the original author as co-author--that 
is, set the author field to "Joe Bloggs and Dave Smith".

Understood.  With all the various licenses out there, I wonder if I 
would just be better off contacting the specific authors and asking how 
they would prefer it be handled on a case by case basis.  I could 
probably spend hours trying to unravel exactly what each license allows.

In the case where the author does not mind if I modify their code, I'd 
still like to give credit to them as the original author somehow.

Thanks Ryan! That will be great for the WordPress ecosystem.
Projecting of a month or greater would allow projects around
documenting, translating, plug-in, theming, supporting, and marketing
to really take part in the success of a release.

Tried the forums but I'm not sure if that's the place for it.

Anyone know the query to add a sub-category and a sub-page in install.php? I
want to be able to use it to do auto set-ups for custom themes. Any help
would be great.

I'm also trying this for WordPress MU for a different project.
I've successfully added an extra category, post and page. I'm so close!
Thanks for any help.

Most of the stuff I've reedited and release for Wordpress has been for
WPMU.  I usually just add in a 'Modified by me' to the description
field with a link under the me bit.  I also drop the original author
an email although not everybody writews back.

Not really doing any of this for credit although I can see why it
would be needed.

Message-ID: <cede70600609191328v6f27cc3fk2afd33bb73655049@mail.gmail.com>

Esteemed WP Hackers,

I have been assigned the task to create a WPMU blog network consisting of
over 20 blogs with a cumulative +40K articles. Though challenging at times I
have completed 95% of all the work, however I am now pinned to a wall
staring into a performance/scalability nightmare.

I am looking for a caching solution compatible site-wide with WPMU.

Anyone have any insight on scaling WPMU blog networks?


Thanks ahead of time,

Shayne Sweeney

Nightmare? Even local-machine caching is really good.

If you want something shared, use memcached:

Yes, I use Memcache and it works well for me. I used Ryan's post here
as a reference:

Anyone know the query to add a sub-category and a sub-page in install.php? I
want to be able to use it to do auto set-ups for custom themes. Any help
would be great.

I'm also trying this for WordPress MU for a different project.
I've successfully added an extra category, post and page. I'm so close!
Thanks for any help.

Like you said, I'm not sure if this is the best place for a request like
this, but here's my answer:

Categories: A category is made a subcategory by setting category_parent to
something other than 0, namely the ID of the category which is its parent.
If it is 0, then it will just be handled as a root category (no parents). If
you can't figure out the SQL for this, feel free to ask.

Pages: First off, a page is differentiated from a post by the setting of
post_status. Pages always have it set to "static" (without quotes, of
course), and posts can have it published, draft and private. That said, a
page is made a sub-page similarly to a category. There is a field
post_parent which is the ID of the page's parent. If it is 0, it is a
root-level page.

I hope this answered your questions.

Thanks for the help. It is the SQL that I'm having trouble with but your
explanation helped in other ways. Here is what I've used for a subpage
without success:

$wpdb->query("UPDATE $wpdb->posts SET post_parent = 3 WHERE post_ID =
4 AND post_status = 'static'");

Got no results from this. And no clue what the query would look like with a
sub-cat.

In my (upgraded from 1.5 -> 2...) posts table, the key field is ID, not
post_ID.  When I run
"UPDATE xx_posts SET post_parent = 1 WHERE ID = 2 AND post_status =
'static'"
in phpMySQL I get a returned row.  Haven't tried it in PHP.

Corresponding T-SQL for categories is
"UPDATE xx_categories SET category_parent = 1 WHERE cat_ID = 2"
I believe.

Stupid question, but you *have* inserted the post already, right?

Also, as the email after mine suggests, use ID instead of post_ID.

Cori, thanks. I'll give this a try. Makes sense.
Robin, not a stupid question. I'm placing the query right after the first
page INSERT query. So I'm figuring that the post is setup at this point.
Right?
After I get this to work I'll try updating the codex as well as well as
adding in the parts about sub-pages and sub-cats.
Thanks again for the help.

Hello,

> Nightmare? Even local-machine caching is really good.
this seems to be my only-one chance to mail to wp-hackers: Webmail. I'm sorry for the advert below. :-(

@Matt: How many plug-ins have you installed to test your blog software? I have more than 20 plug-ins installed (see here: http://blog.mxchange.org/system-infos/ ) and it's painfull slow. Lots of SQL queries are slowing it down and even the filter-system (still execelent piece of software!) is slowing down my blog. I have generation times around 20 secs. This is definedly to slow.

BTW: Have you read my entry in forum? Its here:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/81860?replies=57

I will upload my latest changes very soon to my blog so you can download it soon. Please read my entry in forum first. :-)

Thanks a lot. I will try them out. I have found some core functions anyway which can be accelerated by caching. More in a minute about this.

No one can vouch for the collective quality of 20+ plugins.

Looks like a good example of why development topics are probably better 
for the mailing lists.

> I will upload my latest changes very soon to my blog so you can download it soon. Please read my entry in forum first. :-)

If you mean the $wpdb cache changes, I don't think this would be a good 
candidate for core. Even when not hitting the query cache, WP's queries 
are usually less than 5% of its total execution time unless something on 
the DB end is really badly configured or there is an unusually high load.

Far more time is spent in the compiling and execution of PHP, which is 
why things like APC give such a huge boost in performance and something 
like wp-cache which prevents most of WP from loading performs great.

> Thanks a lot. I will try them out. I have found some core functions anyway which can be accelerated by caching. More in a minute about this.

There is a built-in caching system in WP. It's not turned on by default 
anymore because the performance boost was insignificant and it caused 
lots of support errors. You can enable it in your wp-config.php file.

My classmade has "interpreted" this sentence for me. You mean I have to much plugins installed and that's why my blog is slow? Is that how I have to interprete this? My English is a bit poor. :-)

Well, if you mean this I need to tell you that I'm "benchmarking" and testing WordPress a little by hacking core code, modifying templates and patching other's plugins. While this progress I have improved several plugins for other people (e.g. Ozh's Click Counter, Bot-Check, BDP RSS Aggregator and many more, Spam Karma 2). I made them all all work together.

Now I'm targeting on the core of WP. I want to improve it in many cases. Let me give you an example here:

wptexturize() is a core function. It uses a bundle of preg_replace() and str_replace() functions. When you send one text, e.g. "The lazy dog jumps over the brown fox." (or so ;-) ) it will always (!) produce the *same* result. And here my optimization comes:

When the same source text will always become the same target text why don't we cache it on disc and/or in an array? We don't need to let the interpreter do the same thing 20 times (e.g. when the script shall 20 times do wptexturize() on the same text).

I have done it here and the result is a lesser usage of preg_replace() and str_replace(). The result is a much faster execution time. :-)

Yupp, I know. :-) I still have trouble sending signed and unencrypted emails with my mail program "KMail" to this mailing list. I can only send email here from the GMX' webmail website. Sorry for the advert on bottom of this email. :-(

In general, when no data is updated by queries like UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, ALTER there is a good chance to cache the data because there is no need to communicate with the database which is time-consuming (PHP has to send the query to the database, the database processes the query, utilize the discs which takes time, and finally send the fetched data back to PHP).

A good point for me starting development on it. Well, I have already activated it here and experienced no problems with it. Let me see what I can do.

Forigve me, this *is* support, and I don't normally spam the list for
things like this, but I have a feeling this can't be helped in the
forums.....

I found a bug in WP that is driving me insane. I've been writing a
Windows Vista RC1 review since it came out, and this week the
extremely long review is done.... I go to post it, and it just hangs
when I press "Save and Continue"  and no matter what, I can't get that
post to display in the write panel: it just hangs.

It's REALLY long, but if I "Save and Continue" it as a *page*, it'll go through.
I've unchecked "Attempt to notify any Weblogs linked to from the
article (slows down posting.)" although it shouldn't matter (though
the post has many links I'm still saving it as a draft, so it
shouldn't ping....)

I can save and edit the page at will on WP 2.1 on my local IIS test
server, but on the remote (real) server, it just goes haywire (WP 2.1
as well).

Doing page.php?action=edit and using that post number shows it right,
but no matter what post.php?action=edit doesn't show it.....

I really need to publish this (and posting the full article here isn't
actuallly an option)... does this sound familiar to anyhting?

Works as a page but not as a post
happens when pingbacks are disabled too
works on local IIS server but not on remote linux/apache

Again, really sorry about posting it here, and hope someone can help.

IIS has a very powerful (and free) rewrite engine (same as mod_rewrite
actually)..... would it be possible for WP to employ it so that users
of IIS aren't stuck with "index.php" before any custom permalinks?

Just a thought....

OK - I'm going to ask the old chestnut question. It's just not an  
area I'm that familiar with...
Does WP have any core functions/ routines for checking whether js is  
enabled? Or are plugin authors on their own with this one? And if  
they are - any recommended strategies would be appreciated...

If you really want to go down and dirty on it and get the post up
immediately.  Cheat. 

Post it via php my admin...  Publish the post with just your intro paragraph
in it on your real blog, to get the benefits of ping-0-matic.  Then copy the
contents field from the raw tables via phpmyadmin (and the clipboard) and
paste it into the your contents field for that post in your online DB.

Nasty but it would work...

Nobody has mentioned that you can also monitor this information yourself in
the trac...

If everyone does what their supposed to, releases will be given a date.
For example when 2.0.4 neared, you could go to see an estimated date at this
url:
http://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.0.4

You can see that 2.1 is far enough off, that there is no date set yet:
http://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.1

The date isn't written in stone and wasn't followed precisely for 2.0.4. 

But if you want a ballpark notification, just track that page for changes
and you'll know when the time is drawing near.

Using the default theme and showing ten posts, wptexturize() is called 
less than twenty times total.  That's for the entire page.  Are your 
plugins doing all of that extra texturizing?

Yes, that's for the GNU GPL: No warranty. :-)

Back to topic: I have continued my SQL cache.

wptexturize() is only an example. I added also some caching to wpautop(), 
sanitize_user(), sanitize_title_with_dashes(), backslashit(), get_settings() 
and mysql2date().

Only mysql2date(), wptexturize() and sanitize_title_with_dashes() are flushing 
their cache to disc by creating lots of small files.

The goal of this is to reduce function calls and so execusion time. I have 
already tested it with my 20+ plugins and a basic WP installation (only one 
anti-spambot plugin).

Hmmm, the elapsed times are differing very much between two cached executions 
or between two uncached execution. :-( Is there a way of measuring the 
execution time where you can count on?

One of the servers you ping (like pingomatic) is most likely causing this problem. They are probably blocking the request.
I too have seen such delays but the post do get posted because of a plugin I use to increase the allotted time.

You can simply delete all the servers from the list (after saving a backup) and you should be able to post fine.

A final option is to change the status in the database directly.

Hello again,

one important thing before: Have you seen my mail from *this* email address? 
In my previous emails I have signed it with OpenPGP/MIME. I guess that was 
also the reason why mails cannot come through here from my GMX address 
(will-hier-weg.de is a "fun-domain" by GMX.net)

Okay, I have found a little "bug" in the function add_filter(). There you are 
typing:

// SNIP
if ( $filter['function'] == $function_to_add ) {
	return true;
}
// SNAP

But it must be three equals or else you will get a notice that the 
object "blabla" cannot be converted to int. You will get these notices when 
you say "error_reporting(E_ALL);" (without the quotes) in wp-settings.php and 
comment-out the other error_reporting line.

And here comes another one:

The same include file again:

Replace is_feed() with this snippet to reduce another notice:

//--------- HOTFIX - 09/20/2006-19:52 -------
function is_feed () {
     global $wp_query;

     if (isset($wp_query->is_feed)) {
          return $wp_query->is_feed;
     } else {
          return false;
     }
}
//--------- HOTFIX - 09/20/2006-19:52 -------

The reason why I'm fixing notices is simple: The PHP interpreter is generating 
a notice when e.g. an undefined variable will be used in an if() container or 
in an addition like:

$target .= $undefined1.$undefined2;

All these must be handled by the interpreter and this is time-consuming and 
uninitialized variables *can* be used for attacks when register_globals is 
on.

I have found many many other notices in core functions. May I send you a link 
to my patch which you can download and (hopefully!) include in your next 
release?

Best wishes,

I don't know if the following is desired, but I'd like to suggest a 
couple of changes to the image/file uploading process and see what the 
gurus think.

1. For the upload fields, how about indicating what each field can/will 
be used for?  For instance instead of just Title, could it read Title 
(for links) / Alt Text (for images)? This would be a simple patch, but I 
don't know if anyone else thinks it is warranted.

OR

2. I think this could be accomplished by a plugin, so I'm going to 
investigate more, but how about another option to allow either the title 
or the description to be used for alt text on images? Currently (2.0.4 
version) description is not used that I can see from testing with files 
or images.

 From my standpoint, it seems that Description would fit more naturally 
as the alt text than title when uploading images, especially since the 
Title field text IS used for the title attribute in links.  When 
uploading files, perhaps an option to put the description below the link?

Perhaps something like the following options:

IMAGE UPLOADING
-Radio button- 'Use Description for Alt text'
-Radio button- 'Use Title for Alt text'

FILE(NON-IMAGE) UPLOADING
-Checkbox- 'Show Description with link'

So I guess what I'm proposing is to use all three fields, File as 
filename, Title as title, and Description as alt text/file description.

Sorry for the brain dump, but I'm currently in the process of uploading 
a bunch of images, so I've been looking at this most of the day.

I have finished now reducing the notice messages. Hmmm, the number of cache 
hits and database hits are significantly reduced, too.

As it looks like the notices has also caused lots of function calls. My weblog 
(with 20+ plugins) on my Intranet is very fast now.

Okay, I send the bug-report including this discover.

Hi everyone,

My apologies if this is seen as spamming the list.  My employer, the New York 
Times, is looking for someone to act as lead dev for our editorial blogs.  
We're looking for someone with extensive WP experience, and not having much 
luck via the traditional outlets (Monster, HotJobs, etc.) hence this posting 
to the list.  This is strictly an *on-site* job here in NYC.  (I am currently 
acting as interim dev while we look for a permanent candidate.)

If you're interested, please contact me at <sheckler@nytimes.com>.  Here's the 
formal job posting:

----------

Wordpress Web Developer

NYTimes.com, the #1 newspaper site with 1.7 million worldwide visitors a day, 
is seeking an experienced Wordpress Developer to manage our highly-trafficked 
and growing set of blogs (http://www.nytimes.com/blogs).  The blogs have all 
been highly customized to fit into the NYTimes technology stack and 
publishing environment.  Beyond having deep experience with the Wordpress 
platform and its plug-ins, the ideal candidate will be a savvy, all-around 
web applications developer who is comfortable in a LAMP environment.

While the web developer?s primary responsibility will be to manage, develop, 
and enhance the various Wordpress blogs produced at NYTimes.com, it is 
expected that his/her responsibilities can and will expand to other 
technologies and areas of the site depending on the developer?s specific 
skill set and interests.

This position is in the software development group of NYTimes.com.

Requirements:
3-5 years expertise in hand-coding HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and DHTML across a 
range of browsers
2-3 years experience programming in PHP
2-3 years experience developing and maintaining Wordpress blogs
Strong working knowledge of SQL and Apache (mod_include a major plus)
Experience working in a Unix environment (FreeBSD a plus)
General familiarity with internet networking
Enthusiasm for emerging technology, especially AJAX and Web 2.0 APIs
Ability to weigh editorial and design concerns against technical constraints

The New York Times Company is committed to a policy of providing equal 
employment opportunities without regard to race, color, religion, national 
origin, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation or disability.

I'd also like to see an option to not create thumbnails.  I size images
exactly as I want them, and never use the 'nail.  The thumbnailing takes
time and resources, as well as creates a slew of "...thumbnail" files
that I just have to go and delete.

I've tried to find a hook/option/filter where I can talk WP into not
creating thumbs.  Maybe I'm just not finding it.  But if there's a
discussion about cracking open the uploading code this option would be
on my list.

Thx.

That's going to be hard to find, I'm not sure many people (except the  
automattic guys, who aren't going to go and work for new york times)  
have 3 years experience with WordPress... All those big companies  
with stupid requirements in their resumes. what you should be looking  
for is:
- A guy who knows what he's doing
- and is serious about it.
Sorry, just letting out some of my personal frustration at all those  
job ads, nobody gives newbies a chance nowadays... This is more of a  
general rant, not specific to this ad, I don't live in NY anyways.

On a similar note-- I already wrote a patch to make the thumbnail size 
configurable-- it doesn't seem to have stirred up any interest:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3073

Maybe this is the time to write a few useful hooks into the image uploader?  
Right now it's kind of half-baked and impossible to fix w/ plugins.

Actually to work at Automattic you need 8 years of WordPress experience, 
and at least 15 years with PHP.

(And I agree. :))

Zend's Studio software has a script profiling tool that works very
well for this purpose.

The last time I ran the profiler, the function with the worst
performance was remove_accents. I resolved this by adding a fast
preg_match at the top of remove_accents and the profiler indicated wp
loaded a few percent faster. So it's a good tool.

Now, about your pages taking 20 seconds to generate. That is almost 20
seconds too long unless the server is a Commodore 64. I don't believe
you are running 20+ plugins and you haven't found THE ONE that is
causing this. Nothing in WordPress is that slow.

Have you tried var_dump($wpdb) on wp_footer to find badly-written
queries, insane joins, or tables that could use an extra index? Have
you called the datacenter to ask if somebody over-watered the ficus or
something? ;-)

Cheers,
Andy

Why not just do all of it in the INSERT query? Unless you have no control
over that query...

At a glance at the documentation, it looks like it uses a similar syntax as
Apache's mod_rewrite.

What exactly would be needed to change? Apart from where the rules are
inserted... I doubt ISAPI_Rewrite uses .htaccess files as well.

I agree. My WordPress pages were taking a while to load (almost 10 seconds,
unheard of by me with my host before), and it turned out that they were
doing some stuff on the backend of the server. After normal conditions
resumed, the execution was back to around a second and mostly under that.

Interesting, My resume says I have this experience, you think I should 
apply...

> ROFL

I'm with Roland on this one.

we just tried to hire a java developer guy, we put down the job requirements 
that we needed, you know, must be able to spell "Java" and knows that Object 
Orientation is not running round the countryside on the weekend with a map 
in your hand... and the HR department added: "Must be educated to degree 
level, with 3 years industrial experience"

I asked what my job entailed as the teams manager, it seems I need 6 years 
experience... I asked if I needed to resign if I didn't have it.

Idiots.

No idea what the syntax for this would be. Just got WP set up on my local
machine with MAMP and going to get this going. What would you suggest?

Thank for all your hints. I have uploaded a little patch which will fix lots of notice messages which are normally surpressed (and they shall always be surpressed on a "productive/hot" blog) but they can be made visuable with error_reporting(E_ALL);.

I want your oppinion here: Do surpressed notices slow down the interpreter while parsing PHP scripts? In my view they do. Some mails past I wrote that the interpreter needs to "handle" them by doing some analysis (e.g. undefined variable or non-exisiting object used string-to-int converting where the most notices when I debug WP).

Do you share my oppinion about this matter?

I use the APD and pprofp program here. :-) But which time is the most important? Total elapsed, system or user time? Sorry for the n00b question.

I will try out to get my blog installed in Intranet and then disable every plugin step-by-step.

Btw: the Extended Archive Plugin (or so?) did show up the most notice messages. And I could fix everyone. :-) I send my patch to the author to let him know it.

I will try this var_dump($wpdb) thing out. Thanks. And I'm "root" of my server. :-)

I already have an account (quix0r) on wordpress.org and cookies are accepted for the whole domain. Maybe a session-timeout has also caused this? I try it again this evening. :-)

Yeah, it's basically a port of mod_rewrite, and works with almsot the
same exact syntax.
It doesn't use .htaccess...... it uses httpd.ini and can be used
globally or on a per-directory basis - exactly like mod_rewrite.

>From teh docu:
There are two types of configuration files - global (server-level) and
individual (site-level) files. The global configuration file should be
named httpd.ini and should appear in the ISAPI_Rewrite installation
directory. The shortcut of this file is provided through the start
menu. The individual configuration files should be named httpd.ini and
could appear in physical root directories of virtual sites. All
configuration files have the same format. And it is the format of a
standard Windows INI file where settings are broken by sections. The
only section allowed in this version of ISAPI_Rewrite is
[ISAPI_Rewrite]. All directives should be placed in this section and
each directive should be placed on a separate line. Any text outside
this section will be ignored.

Full documentation at: http://www.isapirewrite.com/docs/

Sample file:

[ISAPI_Rewrite]

# This is a comment

# 300 = 5 minutes
CacheClockRate 300
RepeatLimit 20

# Block external access to the httpd.ini and httpd.parse.errors files
RewriteRule /httpd(?:\.ini|\.parse\.errors) / [F,I,O]

# Block external access to the Helper ISAPI Extension
RewriteRule .*\.isrwhlp / [F,I,O]

# Some custom rules
RewriteCond Host: (.+)
RewriteRule (.*) /$1$2 [I]



Very straight-forward,, just create the .htaccess file AND the
httpd.ini file, and let the webserver chosse which to use.
Wouldn't that work??

I'm still moving, (hence my lack of activity), and though I'm done I
don't have internet at home yet, so I can't test this (my IIS server
is at home).... but I'll see if the university has a testbed vertual
server I can use to check this out on..... but what do you guys think?

The only drawback is that not everyone uses it. Everyone with apache
uses mod_rewrite, but htis is a relatively rrare product, though it is
the only free implementaton of mod_rewrite for windows.

But in the options in wp-admin I tried unchecking "notify linked

Hackers, code cracker's, slackers...

Looking for another one of your great collaborative solutions that is a
product of the ingenious minds reading this email. :)

I am using Wordpress MU.

Lets say, I want to generate a "mobile" version of ALL the content on my
WPMU network of blogs dynamically.

My requirements.

1) Our current URL structure...

http://domain.com/joes-blog/2006/09/21/article-title-here/

...here's what I am thinking of ...

http://domain.com/joes-blog/mobile/2006/09/21/article-title-here/

2) Use of a single theme. I have been exploring the possibility of adding
alternate template files as there are plenty of lines of shared design code
I don't want to separate.

3) Efficient as possible. :D

Word (press) to my hackers,

Shayne

Message-ID: <e6ec604d0609210404q70c43624tea97eb2e65920a03@mail.gmail.com>

Internet Explorer users sometimes see images reload/flicker when
toggling the draggable boxes, widgets, or when working with TinyMCE.

In working on the upcoming tabbed editor, I ran across the following
article about the way IE refuses to cache some images:

http://www.ahinea.com/en/tech/ie-dhtml-image-caching.html

This affects DBX, TinyMCE, Widgets, and any other scripts that add
images to the page. It only happens in certain circumstances and
supposedly not in IE's default state. However it's been a problem for
me for ages and this solution made my day, so I'm sharing it. Cheers!

If it's just your browser bothering you, check that the following is
not set to "Every visit to the page."

Tools -> Internet Options -> General -> Temporary Internet files
Settings -> Check for newer versions of stored pages: Automatically.

If you're dealing with lots of people complaining and you run the
server, use Apache httpd's mod_expire. This is probably not a bad idea
anyway, unless you frequently modify images on your server without
renaming them. I added text/css to the list of matching types because
TinyMCE also causes the editor's stylesheets to reload when TinyMCE is
toggled on and off.

Cheers,
Andy

WordPress should already "support" ISAPI_Rewrite if it's configured
correctly, the same way pretty permalinks are available via 404
handler even if mod_rewrite is disabled. Use of the `/index.php`
prefix isn't enforced, just suggested if mod_rewrite isn't detected.

I doubt very much that ISAPI_Rewrite auto-configuration will ever get
in the core, but it should be workable via plugin -- maybe by hooking
into the `update_option_rewrite_rules` action.

Both sites are running on IIS, I assume...?

Perhaps your INSERT query is exceeding your host's max_allowed_packet
size.  I would look into getting access to your webserver's logs.  See
if php is logging any weirdness there.

Not to reply to myself here or anything, but a quick hit on mysql'd
max_allowed_packet is available here at the head of the page:

If you did it the other way around:

http://domain.com/joes-blog/2006/09/21/article-title-here/mobile

There is a function in WP 2.1 (not sure about MU) that allows you to add 
new endpoints to URLs that are parsed by the rewrite class.  A couple of 
hooks later, and you could display an alternate template based on the 
presence of the new endpoint ("mobile") in $query_vars.

Look for the function, called add_endpoint().

Message-ID: <p225h21u5tkd9ekb7tnm4n2sf9rh5etrcg@4ax.com>

More and more theme and plugin developpoer ask how to make they
products I18N and even fi there si some codex docs lot missed it and
launch theyr product with no I18N at all.

IN the ticket list for 2.1 we have setted to have plugins with theyr
own text domain and then locale .mo files will be included by the
localization teams, for plugins we arranged a method to have the info
shown in the plugins dashboard localized too (even if is not a good
method caus it need to edit the plugin files).

For theme we are still at what we setted since 1.2, stripping out all
the I18N functions and having every locale team choice to have a hard
coded translation (as ve do for it_it) or having thyr own I18N version
with the right locale language files.

I think this caused that tons of themes (someof them really nice and
widly used) wasn't and still aren't I18N and have no localization and
thousands of users spend time to translate them in they locale
language hard encoding the transaltion and introduciong errors in the
php code also causing questions and asking for help (for italian forum
this ihappens very often).

I would like to see the I18N of distro thems back again. If most agree
i can set up a patch in few days

I doubt this would cause the page to not load. MySQL would return a
warning, as I have intentionally lowered the limit to hit it before
and it doesn't cause the page not to load, just a warning/error to be
displayed.

It definitely exhibits that behavior on every Apache server I've ever
seen, but I thought we were dealing with IIS here, a subject area with
which I have mercifully little experience.

Hmmm, perhaps RichEdit on one tab, standard edit on another, TRUE html
source on a third?

That would work better than the HTML popup and forced RE choice.  Of course,
you'd still have to put a preference in the user profile to optimize the
screen load...  Interesting...

Here's hoping!

Hello boys and girls,

I'm currently "porting" my "notice-patch" which I have introduced and 
described why you shall avoid notices in previous emails now to the latest 
SVN files.

Just to let you know it. :-)

More conversation on this topic continues in the ticket:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3155

I find it interesting that it seems to take PHP longer to figure out 
what to do with an uninitialized variable (as in the sample code), but I 
don't know that there is anywhere specific in the WP code where adding 
declarations would make as significant an impact as in the sample.

Nope.
First: I can save it as a page: hence, its not too large. Its
something WP for sure, since I only experience this with *posts* and
not pages.
In my first message I believe I said it was Apache on Linux that was
the remote server.. IIS is only local (IIS 6 > apache... all other IIS
blow though!!)

Its not the MySQL, its not the pingbacks, its not the Apache, its not
the server, and its not my internet connection, it's just WP going
crazy for some inexplicable reason.

To recap:
1) Saving as Page works great
2) Saving as post *submits* the page, but attempting thangs on
reloading it. Doesn't work.
3) Disabling sending of pinhgbacks has no effect.
4) 100% Valid XHTML
5) Doesn't happen on IIS

I'm going to create an account at wordpress.com and test posting it
there soon as I get the chance, thanks for bearing with me guys!!

I'm not sure what you mean by that....
WP adds index.php whether you have isapi_rewrite installed or not, and
if you create a custom permalink without the index.php bit, it'll fail
to get redirected to WP for proceessing.
You have to manually create a rewrite file for isapi_redirect, and
*then* create a custom non-index.php permalink structure for it to
work same as on linux.....

As the title says..... the only difference is what happens after you
press post: where it goes.
As far as the SQL goes, it's a single field that is different..
meaning there is a lot of redundant code between the two.

I don't know if this has been discussed before (sorry in advance if it
has), just wondering if that would be a possible
de-bloating/optimizing course of action :-)

(plus we could easily change post to page in that way!!)

It doesn't, the logic in the ticket is flawed. It takes PHP longer to
generate a notice. Thus, if we had E_ALL on by default, there might be
a performance hit. But as you can see in line 77 of wp-settings.php,
all of it is a bunch of premature optimization. Setting the variables
even to an empty string probably takes longer in PHP < 5.2 because of
the extra malloc (PHP 5.2 has a new memory manager which takes a bit

I should have worded the initial response on the ticket better, but I
can't go back and edit it. At any rate, its premature optimization,
which might end up having a negative impact on the execution time in
the long run. (Benchmarks coming)

I'd like to fix notices where we can, but I agree that we shouldn't
necessarily be optimizing for E_ALL.  Who runs E_ALL in a production
environment?

I'm no hacker, but I'm not sure that  "Attempt to notify any Weblogs
linked to from the article" on the Options > Discussion page stops WP
from pinging the sites listed at Options > General. To me, it would
appear that options stops pingbacks/trackbacks linked to in the actual

That's right. But if you do manually create the file, it *will* work.
Your original message seemed to suggest that it was impossible to use
ISAPI_Rewrite without changes to the core, and that isn't true.

It'd be nice to be E_ALL clean. The performance hit for doing the
isset and alloc on each var is negligable, but if we're going to E_ALL
clean it let's not let it masquerade as a big performance fix, as
it'll likely be the opposite.

Yes, I do. But they're not the problem (refer to previous emails in
conve for details, but basically I can post anyhting and it'll work -
but not this one article. I disnbaleed that checkbox in particular
because my article has a lot of links...)

Simply: Saved it as a page
http://neosmart.net/blog/wp-admin/page.php?action=edit&post=262
that uri works perfect
http://neosmart.net/blog/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&post=262
this one just hangs.

It doesn't make sense. The data is IN the SQL server, its not being
stored, not actions are negin taken> data should be pulled from the
DB, and displayed on teh write pael. but something is stopping that
from happengin. Not sure what. Is the requesting code for post.php
different from page.php???

its definitely WP, there is nothing left, and itss certainly a bug.

(forgive my spelling please, this isn't my laptop, and i hate qwerty!!)

My apologies, I hadn't brushed up on my ISAPI_Rewrite reading :-)

My previous email clarifies the necessary steps: WP-Core just has to
"clone" the .htaccess file as httpd.ini... it doesn't hurt to have
both.

If that's the case and if there is a reliable way to determine if 
ISAPI_Rewrite is enabled, we can probably add this to core.

Memoization of function results can be done with the object cache we 
already have.  Memoization of the formatting functions may or may not be 
worth it.  Often times creating keys for the cache takes enough time to 
not make it worthwhile for functions that will only be called a few 
times with the same data.  Usually we are better off making the function 
faster, if possible.  We have some patches for texturize that make it a 
good deal faster.

Caching SQL results, especially the results of the front page query can 
make a big difference. We've played with different approaches to doing 
this but none have been committed thus far.

There's a function called wp_insert_post that does all the work for you. It
takes an array with all the post info in it, just make sure to have an entry
in the array with a key post_type = page and post_status = static.

The more important time is the time it took on the server to process the
request, so the system time. The user time can vary, due to many conditions
such as their internet connection (56k vs. Cable), their location (you're in
USA, they're in China or something), and so on.

I would be more worried about the system time, for the user time is often on
their end.

PHP will do the logic whether or not the variable was defined. It
still needs to test to see if the variable was defined, and if not,
then it can trigger an E_NOTICE. Adding code to do issets() and an
extra alloc to set the variable to an empty string will be more of a
performance hit than the variable being undefined, as that is an extra
call to isset() which PHP is already doing internally before trying to
fetch the variable, and an extra alloc if its not set.

At any rate, either way, the difference is negligable, and isn't
something to MFH if you're having performance issues.

As I said in my last email, I think 3 tabs would be better. One with TinyMce
one with Quicktags and one with unfiltered HTML that saves directly from
that tab. The preference could still be set in the user profile.  (Perhaps
you only choose std or advanced and advanced defaults you to using QuickTags
as the first tab.)  This would also address the concern of all of those who
have requested an easy way to switch between the quicktags editor and the
WYSIWYG editor.

I usually use the quick tags editor.  On rare occasions, I will use TinyMCE
for its convenience and for normal posts, it is not THAT far off the track.
I'd probably use it more if it were just a tab.  There are certain times,
often when bringing in content from external sources, that you need the raw
HTML to fix issues - misaligned tags and ill placed <br/> vs <p/> etc.  Even
then, there have been times when I've had to edit it within PHPMyAdmin just
to get it to do exactly what I wanted it to.  It will be nice to be able to
save directly from the RAW html tab without re-loading it into the other
editors prior to the save.  Any editor will interpret what it loads and
saves.  Loading and saving bitwise (or even functionally) identical content
from a third party source is difficult, if not impossible to achieve in ever
case.  It's a standard 95/5 situation, where the last 5% of the work of
getting an editor to be perfect would take 95% of the work and effort.
Saving from Raw HTML will fix that...

Very nice.
"Compose" and "HTML" don't really tell the user that they are looking at
options for an editor. That said, I'd have to think a bit to come up with
some wording that makes more contextual sense.

The Quicktags editor uses a plain textarea. It doesn't get any more
"unfiltered" than that.

I'll append this to the Trac ticket, but I cannot seem to get the new
tabbed interface to display on Firefox on my RedHat Enterprise 4 box.
I'm running 1.5.0.7 (downloaded from the Moz group's site).  I see a few
JS errors in the console that indicate potential issues with tinyMCE,
but I don't think they should be holding up the loading.

I'll post more details as I find them to the Trac bug, as I stated

No joke: do a poll on wordpress.com.  Give folks like 4 graphical mockups 
with different words, see what they choose.

I'd think that the RTE should be 'WYSIWYG' or 'Rich Text' or 'Graphical' or 
'Preview', etc.  and instead of 'HTML' maybe 'Raw HTML' or 'Plain Text' or 
something like that.

Generally, folks that:

- don't know how to change it
- don't have access to change it

Either way, it's a very poor experience for those users. WP has  
always been E_ALL clean as far as I know, if there is a release that  
isn't, I think there will be a lot of support chatter.

FWIW - I bundle PHP iCalendar which is not E_ALL clean with Tasks  
(which is E_ALL clean). When I forgot to disable Notices in PHP  
iCalendar for a release, I received *way* more reports about it than  
I expected.

I know that this will be controversial, but I recommend "Normal" and "HTML
Code".

I'm sure almost everyone on this list (and many the WordPress forums) will
instinctively recoil from the label "Normal", but the average Office-using
person actually considers WYSISYG normal rather than a special feat of
arcane magic.  It's easy to make fun, but really, why shouldn't they?

Being normal is overrated :)

How's about "Standard" and "Advanced" or is that too Microsoft?

I'm still for the pluggable option with a camel case converter :)

Then why don't you have to put <br/> after every line?  How come you don't
have to indicate paragraphs with <p></p>?  It does get more filtered that or
putting a new line in the editor would not result in a new screen.  

Anyway, I'm not saying the edit box is the problem. It's the processing that
is done during load and save.  When you look at a post in HTML it is not the
same as looking at it in the Quicktags editor.

How about Rich Formatting (that's what Gmail says) and HTML (it's not
just text, and it's not unfiltered, but people who want to use it will
know what "HTML" means, and everyone else will know enough to avoid
it).

How about "Graphical" and "Plain". But aside from the name, the tabs are that 
obvious that one should just click there at least out of couriosity.

That'd be cool, the problem is that there is SOOOO much overhead with
TinyMce, it'd need to either be AJAXified or IFramed (yuck).  The
point is that all that overhead needs to be encapsulated so that those
of us that enjoy self mutilation can use the editor.

Of course ideally we have an editor that has a tiny footprint
and is completely bullet-proof...oh yeah, and get on genetically
eliminating aging while you're at it will ya?

So long as it's all nice and pluggable, that's the main thing.

I swear by Markdown on my blog; it's the perfect balance between
readable and usable, without having to stuff every post full of
angle-brackets.

WYSIWYG is too domain-specific.  I can tell you from user-testing that average people don't know this.

That, Sir, is a very good point.  I wasn't thinking of this in terms of
doing this via AJAX, but it would provide the smoothest and fastest
interface.  Probably, the only one that would be widely accepted.  It if the
clicking of the "tab" brought up the next editor through a post, that would
thin it out, but would not be as "pretty".

Good point. Not only that,  WYSIWYG probably doesn't mean much to a LOT of
WP users whose first language isn't English.

wpautop and other WordPress filters make it so. If you really want to
edit your HTML and have it served as-is, write a quick plugin that
removes all of the output filters.

Look in the database. If you have the unfiltered_html capability, you
will find exactly what you typed in the editor. The HTML you see on
the blog is filtered on output, not save. See
wp-includes/default-filters.php.

WYSIWYG is also a misnomer. What they see is a rendered preview of
their HTML out of context.

Actually, I think WP has _never_ been E_ALL clean. Thus,
error_reporting() is called in wp-settings.php to hide notices.

On a lot of email clients "HTML" refers to wiewing in rich text (images,
bold, italics, etc..). "Rich Text" and "Code" make sense to me.

It would be great to break out these discussions in a separate thread,
or better yet involve the technical communication enthusiasts and
professions on the wp-docs mailing list. Possibly someone could
summarize the discussion and move it there?

I have emailed a couple friends that are senior TCs to see if they
have some time to give their perspective.

Cheers,
Lloyd

Hello,

I have read all your comments and I will make it better next time (in case of 
the ticket system).

With my SQL cacher I'm not targeting only one page (like the index page) I'm 
targeting the whole database system. This will surely produce lots of cache 
files on big blogs (big in number of posts, comments and installed plugins) 
but today there are big hard disks in servers installed where there are such 
big blogs.

So I continue my SQL cacher and place a new ticket when I have finished 
it. :-)

Thanks again for all your posts both in trac.wordpress.org and here in mailing 
list. I really appreciate them all very much. :-)

Roland

Ah, I see that now.  So, the problems I have been facing come into play only
because I am trying to use sections of HTML in Quicktags and because
Quicktags  DOESN'T filter at all and my post are manually doing some stuff
normally done by wpautop, I'm getting the doubling up of line feeds that I
sometimes see.  A quick query shows that I have '<br' in roughly 10% of my
posts.  I'll dig in to wpautop and see if I can identify more specifically
what situations I see failing.  There are probably situations where wpautop
or some related filter are not able to identify that an linefeed does not
need to be added because the html code already provides it.

Thanks for the pointer.

Message-ID: <ca7320070609221425i766c437duc22eb160c21d6147@mail.gmail.com>

We have a persistant problem and I can't seem to figure out why. As some of
you know, I support 150+ WP blogs. One particular ongoing issue has got me
stumped. A user can't login. I can login with the users account, but the
user can't. Neither on her PC or on her Mac. Another user can't login. He
also uses a Mac. I can login with his credentials, but he can't.

Is there a plugin out there that will log errors? I means, the details. HTTP
requests, mysql errors, etc? Something that can generate a text file that I
can look at?

Thanks for any help.

In case you hadn't thought of it, and off the top of my head, disabling 
cookies could cause this.

Been there, done that. It's not cookies. We've done all the obvious things.
Cookies, cache, etc. Nothing. Of course, I can't _look_ at the system
because we're all remote, so I'm basing that on her say-so.

Couldn't you just log the error from wp-db.php? Seems like writing  
this out to a log file would be easiest.

That almost sounds like something is being sent before the headers
resulting in the cookies not being sent.  Just a shot in the dark but
is there something like a warning or a space or something coming
through in certain situations?

No plugins that I know of, and I doubt there really are for security
purposes. The best option I can think of is to back up wp-login, then add a
small section into it to write the login information to a file in a password
protected directory on the server, then get them to try. That will give you
an idea of the password and username. Try to get it so that you can put this
in and have them login in a small time frame, so that you can revert back to
the original wp-login.

I have had the same problems in the pass with MAC users. One case was the
person not entering the login information with proper case. Another was a
cookie issue. Some program they were running was preventing the cookie from
getting set and they ended up having to put the site as a trusted site (or
whatever it is MAC calls it LOL).

Now if was cool enough to render it using the same CSS used by the site,

I've seen this problem when frames are used. For example, when WP is
installed in a subdirectory (/wordpress) and then a frame is used to view
the directory from an index.html file in the root. With FF on my Mac it has
not been a problem though. I've only seen it happen on IE6/Win (that's all
I've tested).

Once you've gone that far, you have all the workings of an edit-in-place system.

Actually TinyMCE lets you specify a stylesheet for use in the rich
editing box. You can edit in green on black if you like, or try to
match your blog's typography or whatever. That is pluggable already.
The filter for the editor stylesheet url is mce_css. Have at it!

+1 pluggable tabbed interface.

I usually use TinyMCE, and then switch to the HTML editor to enter 
<dl><dt><dd> lists (or other non-usual html) and/or fixing the 
inevitable trailing <br> tag.

With this tabbed architecture, will plugins be offered hooks by which 
they can
- add their own tab to the top of the editor block (eg: Markdown)?
- become the default editor tab without overriding the new interface?

If Post is going to be used to switch between the 
Raw/Normal/TinyMCE/Markdown/etc views, then it's relatively* simple to 
convert between formats.

Converting between formats in Javascript would be painful. Doing it with 
ajax calls which run native tested conversion functions on the webserver 
would be slower and less prone to errors.

* converting Raw => Markdown might be tricky?

Ideally, yes. But no one's said 2.1 is coming soon.

Agreed.  All I was really saying was that the 2.0.4 release had a date
up there, and if that procedure is followed again, you can use those
links to know when the release is weeks away.  

But to address your question: Yes, all open issues assigned to 2.1 will
be "resolved" before the release.  Now, keep in mind that, as far as a
software release  and requirement tracking is concerned, "Resolved" us
not the same thing as "Fixed".  You could "resolve" some of those 2.1
tickets by defering them to 2.2 for completion.  You can't release
something until you say it is done.  Whether you get to "done" by fixing
everything or by pushing some stuff to a later release is a management
decision.

Not so long ago, links that are embedded in themes were discussed.

The article makes some very good points, especially about the volatile 
state of URL:s, and on the question of what
should be done, if I want to change the theme and then redistribute it - 
should the links stay?

I don't think that we, meaning wordpress.org or ditto.com, can set rules 
against linkware licensed themes or plugins.
Anyone is free to offer addons to WordPress with any license they fancy, 
as long as they are not offered as GPL'd.

The original question was, I believe, if wordpress.org or .com should 
promote themes with ( mandatory ) links, and
here we may well have a rule, not to do that. I think we shouldn't.

If themes or plugins are offered under the GPL, anyone is free to add or 
remove links, but the grey zone remains.
The problem here is that many users of a theme don't bother or doesn't 
know how to remove a link in the footer.
For the link back to the authors site, I like it to be there, so I can 
contact the author.

I disagree everyone. There are people who don't speak english that well
and who simply need a pointer. Great job Matt in posting a good place to
help this person out.

Although I'm new to the list, when I first started I found it very
frustrating to get non-constructive emails about this as it:

a.) mis-represents the project
b.) discourages newbies
c.) encourage more posts that could spiral into a flame (a bad precedent
to set)

No, no, you've got it all wrong - his mail was a declarative statement
(note the lack of question mark).   It's almost a Zen thing, if you
think about it.  It's like free verse, man.  "HOW CAN I BE AN HACKER"
- that's deep.

Maybe it's a musing on the different tacks American and British
English have taken - after all, that telltale "AN" before "HACKER"
almost proves that Adewale pronounces it " 'ACKER ".  We might have a
genuine linguist on our hands here, people.

Or maybe we just need to redirect his energies towards the nearest
"HOW CAN I BE AN CRACKER" list.

While I don't agree with assuming that this person is not honestly
asking a question, I do think that the term hackers has changed meaning
and might encourage this type of thing.

wp-developers sounds like a more app. title (however, don't fix it if
its not broken).

Subject: [wp-hackers] atom 1.0 support? + dev interest + howto get involved
Message-ID: <1159064365.20642.77.camel@localhost>

Hello all,

I have implemented atom 1.0 support wordpress that is similar to
wordpresses rss 0.92 and rss 2 support in that it allows for both.

This also brings up the question as to why wordpress has not changed
over to atom 1.0 or added this support and if the dev. community is
interested in this? Do you want a patch? I see there are a couple in the
tracking system, but they just replace the old atom 0.3 support which I
think is not good in wiping this old support out.

I have added this in support of two project: creativecommons.org's new
site and also a new project, http://overlap.org (sign up!)

I also wonder about how to get SVN access to the project. I am now
running off the trunk and would like to become a regular contributor to
the project.

What must I do to get commit into the trunk?

With Inkscape we run the ship where we require two patches before we
give someone SVN access, is there a similar hurdle to be jumped to get
dev. access? I would be interested in this as I'm adding much code to
the core of the app.

Also, how does one get access to the plugins in trac? Is this spelled
out somewhere?

I have many projects I would like to help out like to:

a.) add webdav support to wordpress' upload system
b.) add proper unix-style users and groups to wordpress

Anyway, Wordpress is great...I met a few of you at wordcamp and am
excited to start plugging into development.

I also dev. an app for Creative Commons called ccHost which is akin to
wordpress, but for media (http://wiki.creativecommons.org/cchost) It
powers ccmixter.org and openclipart.org/cchost (if anyone is curious to
check me out for legitimacy).

A patch that added 1.0 support in addition to 0.3 would be appropiate 
for trac.

Regular contributors operate through trac, and after things are reviewed 
and tested either Ryan or I commit the patches.

What do you mean?

> I have many projects I would like to help out like to:

The factors I consider when evaluating a new feature for WP:

* Intended audience interest
* Audience size
* Code / maintenance overhead
* Cross-platform compatibility

The answers to these doesn't mean a feature shouldn't be done, but it 
may be better suited for a plugin rather than the core codebase.

> a.) add webdav support to wordpress' upload system
> b.) add proper unix-style users and groups to wordpress

Each of these probably deserves its own thread to flesh out a bit more 
what you had in mind. If you want some background, particularly on the 
roles system, I would suggest Googling the wp-hackers list for some of 
the thinking behind the systems (and also the current proposed 
improvements).

(Please read fully for personal attack disclaimer. ;) )

You are not the first.  There is at least one Trac ticket that does 
this, and there's an Atom 1.0 syndicator that was posted to the list. 
Even I wrote such a plugin last year.

Atom is not just a syndication format.  Atom is also a complete and 
well-documented substitute for XML-RPC in regards to what XPL-RPC 
provides to WordPress.

The question is not whether you have implemented Atom 1.0 support for 
WordPress, but whether you have *fully implemented* the Atom 
specification in WordPress.

For pity's sake, **BLOGGER** has Atom publication support. 
**LIVEJOURNAL** has Atom publication support.  I never assumed that 
WordPress, with the minds on this list, would be the last tool to 
implement the full spec behind these other guys, but...

Please, I beg your pardon.  I don't mean this as an attack on your work, 
or to be directly hostile when you're new to the list.  I simply mean to 
emphasize a single point to the full membership, which is this:  I can 
syndicate just fine with the current RDF, RSS, and Atom flavors that 
WordPress currently outputs, so now if we're going to beat this horse to 
death let's at least get some glue out of it -- Implement the full spec.

That all depends on the operating system you're running. If it's Windows,
merely drop to a command shell and enter:

	FORMAT C: /X

However, if you're running any derivation of Linux, you might try:

 	rm -r *

And if you're using OS X, you can't be a hacker - sorry.

Is the APP final yet? I know the syndication format is, but I think the 
publishing protocol is still in development.

I think this was the best APP implementation I've seen thus far:

http://torrez.us/archives/2006/08/23/487/

Works as a plugin.

OS X is FreeBSD and then some, so that'd work just fine to haxx0r
somebody's Macbook real l33t-like.

Well, Mac OS X is not much different from GNU/Linux. Recently, for

That assumes uid=0 or sudo-level access, though.  I think Chris was just
kindly trying to help Adewale reduce his current home/working directory

Subject: [wp-hackers] Useful caching
Message-ID: <45166686.1010207@mullenweg.com>

On most WP blogs I've seen, there are two pages that get far and away 
the most traffic: the front page and the RSS feed. Ofter it's 5-10x the 
amount of traffic of anything else on the site, so it makes sense to 
focus some attention there.

After the built-in object cache has kicked in, there are really only a 
few queries left on the front page, sometimes as few as 5. Here's the 
queries that are left:

1. Get * wp_posts front page posts.
2. Get the categories of those posts.
3. Get the postmeta for those posts.
4. Get all pages for the menu.
5. Get the total number of pubished posts to decide whether to page.

(These combined took 55 milliseconds, 53 of which was 4 and 5.)

Of these, 4 & 5 are discretely cacheable.

1-3 seems like they could be put into a big $posts object and saved in a 
special case front page cache that's used for the front page and the 
regular RSS feed.

To go a step further, the root RSS feed would be a good candidate for 
wp-cache style output buffer caching, since we don't have to worry about 
things on that page that aren't controled by WP. (And we already send 
the correct caching HTTP headers.)

Well, if people don't read what the list is about, it's pretty easy to
assume that it is indeed a list for hackers. Unless you've used wordpress,
you're not going to know what wp stands for. A lot of people get hacker
confused with cracker. A script kiddie is a type of cracker.

There have been issues in the past with WP.org accounts not having  
Trac access... maybe you signed up during one of those periods.

Matt (or maybe Barry) can help you with this.  If one of them doesn't

I'm not familiar enough with the language of task forces and drafts to 
decipher how complete the format is.  Considering that they've updated 
the spec in September, I'm guessing that they're still working on it. 
Just because it's in flux doesn't mean that we can't target it for 
implementation when the spec is finally approved.

This is the only attempt I've seen to even try it, and it's still 
missing quite a bit, significantly media support.  I would certainly 
much rather see efforts like these than yet another Atom syndication patch.

While that "makes some sense", if it has anything to do with the "built-in 
object cache", it doesn't help the average user -- unless something's 
changed in 2.1. ;)  Last I knew, the object cache was now disabled by 
default, and it actually harms performance in more cases than it helps (in 
some cases, drastically, due to some odd thrash).  Caused/causes a LOT of 
support forum traffic.  And this is especially true on shared servers, and 
cheaper hosting.  I only recommend WP-Cache (or other Staticize derivatives) 
when asked, unless the person is on a dedi box, and knows what they're doing 
(i.e., memcached backend, et al).

That said, always great to do some further caching, if you're really 
targeting the wider audience of folks downloading/using WP.  For all I know, 
the average DL user is no longer the target, and the WPMU-based users are...

One thing I had done (that seemed to make a difference) was to NOT grab * 
from page posts, but only those fields really needed.  ie., if showing only 
excerpts, then grabbing full post content is wasteful, extremely in big-post 
cases.

Frankly, the discussion about caching post-filtered content to the field 
that's sitting in the DB should be re-raised, since that's most of the 
content 'translation' occurring on each pageload, and for large posts that's 
a heavier hit (multiple filters re-processing the body content -- which 
depending on the code can cause PHP to copy the entire block of text over 
and over again...) than the SQL lookup.

At what point do we start discussing rolling WP-Cache/Staticize 
functionality into the core, even if it's just handling certain things (like 
the RSS feeds might be a perfect example)?  Obviously, if you're running any 
random-lookup sidebars, Static-type stuff gets tricky (as it has to be 
wrappered).

Just IMHO. ;)

Just a quick note about the original posters header shows that he or
she is sending it from 68.208.24.194 which is a Bellsouth IP address
assigned to Nigeria.

I vote script kiddy myself.

The most logical thing to put in core would be *if it's writeable,
cache the feed directly to /feed/index.xml*, so it can be served up
without invoking PHP at all.

I watched Typo abandon this approach on a wider scale after investing
fairly heavily in a lot of JavaScript to make the pages not look quite
so static. Caching actual HTML pages this way is something each user
has to decide for themselves... but doing with the main feed makes a
lot of sense.

This is something I actually ended up doing on one blog I maintain (with
over 750,000 feed reads a day LOL). I didn't do it through WP, but instead
used a shell script to read the feed and save the contents to the
appropriate directories as files.

I'm not suggesting we change the current default behaviour, just to plug 
in our current cache infrastructure (which is on by default) to look at 
these high-use situations.

That's a good idea, I don't even think we need excerpts.

You're welcome to try it, just write a loop to dump the output of 
the_content into that DB field, and then modify the_content on your site 
to use that field instead of running filters. It's been a while since I 
ran that test, but I couldn't measure a significant difference. (And 
that was when our filters and regex were less efficient.)

I think wp-cache is at the opposite end of the spectrum from where WP is 
today, and that's good. However I think we could move a little more 
toward the middle without creating any additional complexity for the user.

This might be moot, since after some tweaking and testing I found that 
the built-in MySQL query cache brought the total query time down to 2 
milliseconds. The remaining 298 in the page execution time was PHP.

An email header answers your question. It is not Trac it is at the SVN 'layer"

I've been doing it for a while.  But I'm running additional regex via  
plugins, so what may be a slightly > 1 cost/benefit ratio for me with  
my setup may end up being < 1 for a default WP install.  I was, at  
one point, convinced that this would be of universal benefit, but  
upon more testing, I find that it's only beneficial in certain  
circumstances.  And as the default filters get faster and faster,  
those circumstances are being less and less common.

Once people try on WordPress 2.1 with its cachable posts queries  
(DEATH TO $now!), I think they'll be quite pleased with the  
effectiveness of MySQL qcache.  That completely takes care of the  
costly and frequently-accessed front-page queries, reducing them to a  
couple ms.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Mass install script help
Message-ID: <1372825867.20060925164410@blandt.com>

Hi!

I made a script (mass-install.php) which I run and it then makes multiple installs of wordpress. But I have some trouble with it. Primary mass-install.php
contains all the codes and commands from wp-admin/install.php. And I have a "for" loop in it to change the database prefix for multiple blog installs using
the same database.

The first run is ok (all tables and files get installed 100%). The next run I get the message "You appear to have already installed WordPress. To
reinstall please clear your old database tables first." ... and that's the problem. I have no idea why. The prefixes are unique etc. everything is fine. I
have that feeling that I need to CLOSE and RE-OPEN the mysql connection for every blog install ... but I don't know how to do that. 

How can I reset the complete db connection ??? Could this solve the problem?

Thanks for your help!!

Message-ID: <d54e183d0609250857m57b81c1esb2e26207a8e6868d@mail.gmail.com>

I've been working on a dual-login for a site I maintain that uses Wordpress
and PunBB (the forum). The goal is to have one login page that logs you into
both. There are a couple of odd things I've run into that I've been able to
find workarounds for, but one thing that I can't figure out for the life of
me!

I use this code at the top of my header.php file:

if (isset($_POST['punwp_login'])) {
punwp_login();
$url = 'http://www.newathens.org/login/';
wp_redirect($url);
exit;
}

... which uses some Wordpress and PunBB login code to check things out and
set ye olde cookies... But the problem is that the redirect redirects me to
this crazy message:

OK
The document has moved here.

... which is cool (I'm glad everything is OK) but I'd much prefer to figure
out a way around that.

I don't know if it has something to do with these Trac tickets:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2409
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2360

... or what. I've also used regular PHP header redirects and gotten the same
thing.

Does anybody have an idea that might help me? I'm going nuts!

Self reply...

If anybody has the energy, try putting this code into your header.php file

if (isset($_GET['test'])) { $url = get_bloginfo('url'); wp_redirect($url);
exit; }

... And then visit your blog like so:

http://www.example.com/?test=1

... And you can see what I mean.

It's a bug, wordpress calls status_header(200) in WP::handle_404 which is 
called from WP::main.

status header(200) prints the headers:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Status: 200 OK

But if you want to make a redirect you need status code 301 or 302.

Put status_header(301) or 302 before wp_redirect(..) and it works.

The bug is, that status_header(30{1,2}) should be in wp_redirect.

As you said, If the themes are GPL'd you can drop the link if you want. IMHO
it's themes can be very difficult to "license" in the real world, and track
these licenses is something I can't figure out how it will be. There is, the
code is "licensed", but if i rewrite it from scratch to have the same look
and feel am I breaking the license?

It's so weird linkware licensing...

You're breaking the copyright on the design then (at least in Germany).

All of these tables are going into the same database with the same
user/pass? How are you changing the prefix? Paste a code snippet.

Browsers never advertise their javascript capabilities to the server,
e.g. in HTTP headers. Only by inserting javascript in the page can you
detect js execution.

The discussion fizzled but Robert's sentiment above was shared by
many. To help things along, I've done a bit of hacking.

I have a trunk checkout modified to do the following:
* add Sandbox as wp-content/themes/sandbox
* remove the admin page from Sandbox
* remove the template files from wp-content/themes/default
* retain themes/default/images
* modify default/style.css to use the Sandbox templates
* modify default/functions.php to accommodate the Sandbox header
markup in the custom header routine

What this means:
* The default theme is still based on the famous Kubrick
* The default theme uses Sandbox templates
* Kubrick code is ALL GONE (except functions.php) (this breaks all
existing stylesheet-only themes which utilize default templates)
* Sandbox "skins" are redundant -- they should be released as
stylesheet-only themes -- so Sandbox doesn't really need an admin page
* Sandbox itself is naked (is this a problem?)

Other options:
* Place Sandbox templates in themes/default
* Remove "Sandbox" credit link from theme markup (Default has the
Kubrick URL in an HTML comment, which we could do with Sandbox)
* Add custom header image uploading for Kubrick from WordPress.com (new)
* Scrap Sandbox as a default theme candidate

What do you think?

How about not even putting a style.css in /sandbox?  sandbox would 
strictly be the basis for other themes.

Back-compat for template only themes based on default could be 
accomplished by shipping /kubrick sans style.css and have the template 
loader direct all requests for default templates to /kubrick.  That way 
themes could still inherit default templates and get kubrick templates. 
  We'd also have to change the code that looks for broken themes so that 
sandbox and kubrick don't look broken because of the missing style.css. 
  Those two should be unlisted.  Hmm, maybe have style.css have a 
special header that says, "I'm virtual".

I can dig that. The "Broken Theme" issue could be resolved by calling
stylesheet-free themes something other than Broken, e.g. Virtual or
hidden or whatever. How much good does it do to list themes as
"Broken" when they're missing style.css?

Regarding the Kubrick-based stylesheet-only themes, we might even be
able to get away with leaving the php files in the default dir and
counting on the Template directive in default/style.css to make WP
ignore them.

Hi!

I change it it with simple fwrite (php). But somehow I have that feeling that wordpress is using the database
connection + prefix of the first run of my script. Can you tell me where I can find database
config / variables which is used when you install wordpress?!

Thanks for responding Andy
I did know this. But there are lots of hacks out there that (hidden  
small forms etc.,) that make the attempt and I  was curious if  
anything was embedded deep down in the core that did this on startup.

We might be able to help more if you shared the script you're trying to 
use, where you got it, and what you're trying to use it for.

well, if necessary...

Blundtdotcom is a portal site. No issue there, but in seeing that and seeing
what you are doing here, I immediately start thinking of this issue as being
an attempt to leverage WP simply for advertising gain / page ranking /
splogging or whatever.

Please tell me you are doing this to help hundreds or thousands of people to
enter the blogging world - please.

Message-ID: <a491f91d0609251514m55b71b30ge8b97c2dc1205f12@mail.gmail.com>

As everyone may have already seen via the testers list, many are not
happy with the functionality of the XML export as it stands. Let's see
what we can do to improve it.

As I was writing a plugin yesterday that involves the XML export, I
noticed a few of its limitations. I slept on a few ideas on ways to
improve it, here's what's survived.

(1) Make it essentially a database dump, but in XML format. Include a
way to recreate the entire database schema as well as repopulate it
with XML. One main drawback of this is everyone will immediately ask
"Why do what the database backup plugin does over again in XML?"
Simple, its export. This means that the format should be database
agnostic, so that it can be imported into other systems, across
versions of WP, etc. I am particularly fond of this method.

(2) Keep the system as it is, adding hooks where necessary to allow
plugins to inject their own data where they need to to have it
exported. We also (imho) need to include some other information in the
exports which the above method would fix. Some things to include are
users, options, categories, links, etc.

Thoughts?

They were too busy at first, but when I pointed out that they speak
now or forever see awkwark language in WordPress, Vera Horiuchi was
able to find some time.

'"Compose' sounds a little strange to me.'

'Call it "Editor". People are accustomed to the phrase "text editor."'

She thought the title of 'HTML' for the other tab was fine.

One thing I would like to see, which ties into this, is some filters for 
the dump.

For example you might want just the posts from one author, or in one 
category.

It might also make sense to add "id" attributes to elements in the XML 
that could have them, though we might have to namespace these to 
maintain RSS 2.0 compatibility.

Category hierarchy.

Hooks are a great idea.

I'd just as soon leave out users and options.

What do you mean by "on startup"?

The original question can be answered like this: Design it so it
doesn't matter whether js is enabled.

(I don't claim to be perfect in that regard. Hold your fire.)

"Editor" seems to make sense, but how about honing it just a bit?

Examples:
========
"Post Editor" in the WRITE panel.
"Theme Editor" in the PRESENTATION panel.
"Plugin Editor" in the PLUGINS panel.

Upon thinking about this more, I am wondering if people will assume that
"Editor" (or "Post Editor) is for editing *content* while "HTML" is for
editing the look of the post itself.

Sad thing about English is that sometimes it is to ambiguous for its own
good! Maybe I'm just over-thinking this, so I'll just end this for now and
await further discussion.

Part of my idea about honing the "Editor" nomenclature is for support
purposes, to more quickly and clearly ascertain what editor is causing a
problem or is not functioning as expected.

We could easily copy/duplicate some of the code for doing the main
posts loop and create a set of filters that functions similarly if not
identically with an export_ prefix on the filter names.

Options I can [almost] imagine being left out. Its still kinda hard to
fathom, but I am beginning to be able to see it. Users, on the other
hand, I think would be a rather important thing to export, because
post_author can reference them, and so I think its important to have a
seperate index of the users.

Well, both tabs are editors.  (Did you see all of the other suggestions that

That's nice, and similar language is used by Dreamweaver and other dual-mode
editors.

bad phrase choice. Initialisation perhaps? I realise this is with

Atom would work, and probably should. RSS isn't nearly powerful enough. 
And it should be Atom 1.0, not 0.3.

I'd say it should always be possible to use whatever you're doing without
JavaScript. For example, an AJAX view of some database records should be
able to work without the flashy AJAX stuff (plain old pages).

Always design it with the people who don't have JavaScript in mind.

This is still pretty vague. This is a WordPress list so I'll assume
you mean that you want this information available at the "init"
action.

There is no such information available in core. As I said before,
browsers never expose this info in the request headers. You have to
either make the browser do this, or just send both versions of the
page and write it so that the js code upgrades the non-js HTML.

If you insist on "knowing" whether the browser can do js, possibly the
leanest way to accomplish it would be with a plugin that did the
following:

1. Check for a cookie named "my_plugin_js_test" or similar.
2. If the cookie is set to 'on', the browser probably has js on.
3. Else If the cookie is set to 'off', add some js to the page that will:
 a. Set the cookie to 'on' and
 b. Reload the page, returning you to step 1.
4. Else the cookie is missing, invalid or expired, so do the following:
 a. Set the cookie to 'off' and
 b. Add the js from step 3 (set 'on', reload)

If JS is enabled and the cookie is not set to 'on', this program will
set the cookie 'on' and reload. Otherwise it'll set the cookie to
'off' and continue loading.

See how convoluted that is? I advise against it. :-)

If the themes are GPLv2'ed, then you can do as you please so
long  as you redistribute or make the code freely  available
(probably  granted  when you deal with (X)HTML/CSS). And  as
the ruling in germany demonstrated a couple of days ago, the
GPL holds valid in court.


> It's so weird linkware licensing...


It  is.  And since nothing that we speak of is encoded as  a
'binary blob' (e.g. binary form, Digital Restrictions Mess),
it  would be rather hard to restrict people from  exploiting
freedoms they deserve.

Best wishes,

Roy

Best recommendation I've heard so far.  
* Simple and straight forward.  
* Works for all plugged editors 
* Follows the golden rule of not making the user stop and think.

+1 on this one...

I should probably add one more:

Trunk would be fine, I suppose.  Putting it in a branch would allow 
parallel work on the theme without breaking the working theme in trunk 
for people who are working on other issues and don't want to worry about 
their themes going haywire.  Then when the theme changes are finalized, 
it can be merged back into trunk.

Make Subversion do the heavy lifting.

I know this isn't strictly WP related, but I'm setting up a theme  
preview inviorment for a project I'm working on. I'm using the theme  
switcher plugin to preview the different themes. My problem is that  
they're some themes with the same name, and Theme Switcher uses the  
theme name to select a theme. I would like to set it up to use the  
theme's directory name instead. Anyone know where I should look /  
what i should do to get started?

Convoluted indeed, but is points 3 - 3a possible?
That would mean that a user who in good faith did set his/her browser 
not to accept cookies,
would be forced to accept them anyway. I would prefere to think not.

Hi Joe,

What themes have the same name? This and related info seems to be in a
theme's style.css .

Please let me know if this helps or not,

Yes,. I saw the other suggestions as did Vera. She has specifically
dealt with the same problems before having worked on Netscape, Flock,
Safari, and other products.

One important thing I sometimes struggle to remember in design is that
I are not my user, and in this case neither are Dreamweaver or Front
Page users.

Of course, both tabs are editors, but as you point out language is
often ambiguous for its own good. More so here, for most people the
first tab is the editor, and the other tab shows their post in
gibberish.

A label of more than a word is also often awkward. There are also
considerations of translation.

Ironically, multiple (clarification) word terms often actually
backfire, as people naturally shorten them in their conversations.

Cheers,
Lloyd

Message-ID: <27954c430609261249g6fd539d9i531744bf20739a02@mail.gmail.com>

I would like it introduced (partially) within the core.

Currently the only way I can sensibly use Wordpress with the plugin
choices I want to use is to post using a 3rd party application which
is capable of supplying the same keywords to multiple of plugins.

Thus supplying the same keywords for

Tags
Pictures
Various advertising sources
Social Bookmarking (well maybe in the future)
Etc etc

Thus I would like some way of defining keywords relating to a post
globally, and for the global data to be available to the plugins.

Keywords should be possible to define remotely, either through xml-rpc
or with something simple like <tags>keyword, key word, keyword
keyword</tag> at the top of a post. (you need to be able to change it
at a later date)

Honestly I haven't used UTW

When I setup my last blog, it was decided to use Taggerati
http://www.i-marco.nl/wp/wordpress/

The reason for this at the time was that UTW didn't support adding
keywords within a post. It only supported the default online editor. I
think Simpletags supported offline as well, but didn't have other
functions.

Currently you can have RSS feeds for categories, but I don't think
anyone offers it for multiple tag selections (not sure if this is even
technically viable)

Tagging has a lot of benefits for SEO - it automatically creates lots
of highly focused niche pages, each of which would currently be looked
at as fairly unique by the search engines. 100 tagged posts can quite
easily generate 300-500 additional niched pages of content.

If tagging could be linked with an aLink plugin for links within the
content (using the same keyword list), it would be great for
crosslinking between posts.

Thus introduce a common data table for keywords, even if tag authors
still keep their own custom data tables for how certain tags are to be
represented on the pages.

Agreed.  Additionally, since most people are either task or spatially
oriented, that carries through when they use the computer and they already
have their global context in mind.  They know they are in the process of
creating a post or they feel that they are currently located on the post
page.  Repeating that information on the multi-tabbed editor (in addition to
what's already at the top of the page) will not be a clarification for them.
It will be a complication.  Less is often better.

I agree with this too. I'd like to see a basic tagging system
introduced into Wordpress and then let plugin developers extend on
this functionality by creating features like tag clouds or UTW's
automatic tags. Offline support would also be really cool so that
posting from Live Writer or other desktop blogging tools could add
tags while posting.

Cheers - Stuart.

+1 on Tagging.
-1 on UTW

UTW is powerful but highly unpolished. It seems every change to WP wreaks
havoc on UTW. We've had bloggers ask for tagging, we've installed UTW, and
then they plead for us to remove it.

I'm absolutly against introducing tags to WordPress, because they are the same 
as categories. Having two systems doing the same is something very nasty, I 
think.

Tagging is NOT the same as categories, though there are plenty who
[erroneously] think that. Don't think this thread should go down that road
though.

How about using icons? Or better yet, an animated paper clip! But seriously,
people respond well with icons as they can create associations in ways a
single word might not.

No, but anyone who's created any content for the web before will find the
terms familiar and understandable, and anyone who hasn't won't touch the one
labeled "code".

Yes, please let's not.  Everyone who thinks tags and categories are identical (rather than complimentary), please move along...nothing to see here!

Hello,

I'm currently developing on a SQL query cacher. If you are interested in the 
current state please contact me and I send you my patch + some extra notes.

I will surely release it as free software (not free beer) so all can benefit 
from it. I hope it will be useful for you.

Also, note that it may not be enough to just test for JavaScript being
on/off.  If compatibility is a high priority, you'll want to also test
whether the specific JavaScript feature you need is supported.

+1 Tagging.
-1 Tag clouds - USELESS! :) Yeah, I know, you said they can be part of the
extensibility of a possible core functionality.

As far as the debate over Tags vs. Cats, well, I'm not clear on that myself,
but I agree that it should be another thread.

Just discussed a bit with Aaron and it seems that there is a need for tags in 
WordPress, so I should add, that if tags go into WordPress core, they should 
be optional, so that people who just want to use one system (or maybe belive, 
that tags and categories are the same) can use one system.

You are completely incorrect! Tags are NOT the same as categories. The
way that Wordpress have implemented categories means that they share
some likeness, but they are definitely different. Read the mailing
list archives for more debate on this.

Okay, no more voting...   :O)

This thread is too valuable to go careening off-topic again.

My understanding is that WordPress doesn't currently have even a standard way to represent tags, much less edit them, so every plug-in that does tagging does so in an ad-hoc fashion.  Is that correct?  (I'm still a newbie to many technical aspects of WP.)

Wait. One question about Craig's vote.
I understand the +1.

But on the, -1 does he mean No - he doesn't think tag clouds are  
USELESS? Which means he is for Tag Clouds.

Is there a way to get the full content of a post in the loop while 
ignoring the presence of <!--more-->?

That is, I want something like the_content but I don't want to stop 
where <!--more--> is seen. I want it all. (There are other pages where I 
do want to stop when I see <!--more--> though.)

Surely there's an option to the_content to provide this? Or another tag 
like the_full_content? Whatever it is, I couldn't find it in the codex. :-(

Not a template tag, but the last bit of code there does what you

I think once you modify something, you should credit yourself as the
author, solely, because otherwise you may do a great disservice to the
original author based on his/her getting complaints about your code when
he's not responsible for it and can't do anything about it.

You should of course give full credit to the original author, but
without exposing them to the potential fallout from your modifications.

ex:
   Author:   YOU
   Based on: The hard work and amazingly useful plugin by THEM,
             which I have modified slightly/heavily to do XYZ.
             Please don't bother THEM with any bugs/support issues
             with this modified plugin.

Listing it this way:

   Author: YOU & THEM

suggests THEM worked with you to release this modified plugin, which is
most likely not the case.

One of the ways you show your appreciation for the work of others is to
give them proper credit.  One of the other ways you show them
appreciation is by not saddling them with the consequences of your
modifications.

When 2.0.4 came out I did a post called "Upgrade your sites to the latest
WordPress in 35 seconds.".  It's found at
http://www.thecodecave.com/article243.  I now have a much more updated
version of the script that has a variables section at the top of the script
so that there's only one place that needs to change, optional backups to be
made of the original files, support for blogs running in the "wordpress"
directory, comments (gasp), a password parameter to prevent accidentally
execution, an option to get the nightly build instead of the latest stable
release, and a few more optimizations and improvements.

Now, I want to make certain that I won't be helping people shoot themselves
in the foot if I promote this when 2.0.5 comes out.  With the plugins I use,
I've been able to automatically update three of my sites without disabling
their plugins first.  Other people who use this script have reported the
same.  

Yet, I don't have any proof that some plugins don't require a disable and
re-enable.  It seems to me that you wouldn't need to disable anything, but
I'd rather ask for confirmation than find out, after the fact, that I'm
wrong on this... 

Please ignore the issue that some plugins required manual PHP changes - I've
addressed that already in the Warnings section.  What I'd like to know,
specifically, is if anyone knows of issues that occur when updating WP
without first disabling all active plugins.  I can write a routine that will
disable the active plugins and then re-enable them after the site is
updated....if I have to.  But I'd just as soon keep it simple and not have
any web interaction with the running site.  

So I'm asking, in short: Is this method flawed, or does it, fundamentally,
look OK to you?

I have only recently had issues with plugins when installing and testing

Hi Wordpressers,

Elliotte Harold tells me there has been some discussion here about  
the use of an XML-based import/export format. I would  suggest that  
it is in everyone's interest to settle on a single format for import/ 
export of content to/from all blogging engines.

I have a proposal for just such a format, based on Atom syndication  
(with elements from APP and Atom Feed Threads).

This is driving me insane here:

Not just sometimes but very often when I open my blog (even without the SQL 
cacher) Firefox provides me a "Save as" form and not the page. When I open 
the same blog with Konqueror there are no such problems.

Does Firefox understand something wrong? What is the matter with him? Does 
anyone else have this problem or is it my Apache2 config? Btw: No other PHP 
script is making such trouble and works perfectly with Firefox.

Best regards,
Roland

Subject: [wp-hackers] Useful caching
Message-ID: <200609272334.57855.webmaster@mxchange.org>

Hello,

my patch is done now. You need latest SVN sourcecode so please update your SVN 
before applying it. First of all here is a list of what I have changed and 
why:

- Direct accesses on class fields replaced with getter/setter methods. This is 
about better security - currently only in Java but in PHP6, too! - and a 
better "design of code". There is a good guideline on Sun's webpage which you 
shall read and follow when you code object-orientated.

- Fetching RSS feeds on the dashboard can now sitched off by a constant. Put 
this one line to your wp-config.php:

define('DISABLE_RSS_FETCH', true);

You may need this if you want to use WP behind proxies installed on your 
company's workstation (*always* ask for permission! This can be a reason for 
getting fired). I will start another topic about this after I have finished 
this.

- Closing the database connection is implemented by a shutdown-function in 
wp-settings.php. This is always a good idea... ;-)

- SQL query cacher in alpha state added. This is my youngest baby and it shall 
reduce the number of queries on your database and increase the speed of your 
blog. Remember every request must be *send* to the database. Even when it is 
over a uni* socket (on Linux boxes the most case) its still slower than 
loading a "local" file. PHP needs to send the request over it's library to 
the SQL process, the SQL process loads some database files and processes 
them. Then the result got sent back to the PHP library.

Okay, you told me that your SQL queries are already optimized but 19 (!) 
SELECTs are still 19 queries and way too much for high-usage blogs.

Does someone know what kind of SQL statement (SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT or 
DELETE) is the most used? My opinion on this is SELECT.

Surely this cacher needs some improvement, including the compression methods. 
The functions gzcompress() and base64_encode() which are being used in my 
cacher are currently slowing down the blog too much. So let's have a look for 
faster PHP fucntions.

The cacher also has a built-in debugging function which displays some arrays. 
You can enable it with this:

define('DEBUG_SQL_CACHE', true);

The cacher itself can be enabled with this:

define('ENABLE_SQL_CACHE', true);

I have already added a new ticket you may want to read it here: (same text)
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3174

All your comments on this work are welcome. :-)

Roland

And sorry for my poor english. :-)

Actually, isn't that plugin just for WordPress 1.5, before the
usermeta tables were included?

The usermeta table seems pretty simple: you have three columns of
importance: one for user ids, one for the meta key, and another for
the meta value.

get_usermeta( $user_id, $meta_key = '') returns the meta information,
given a user id and the key value.

update_usermeta( $user_id, $meta_key, $meta_value ) updates the meta
value for a specific user, meta key

This is generally a problem with your web server.

Another strange thing: Even with the default theme there is not the title from 
the blog in title bar. The title in tab bar of the blog is fine. You can 
reproduce it:

- Open your blog and click around.
- Open another new tab and enter e.g. http://www.wordpress.org
- Switch back to your blog-tab.
- The title in main title is not changning
- Open another new tab and enter an other URL, e.g. http://www.akismet.com
- The title changes to akismet's title.
- Now switch through these tree tabs. When your blog is activated the main 
title remains in the previous title.

This can't be a bug in FF (or maybe? does someone have an older version????) 
because with any other pages (maybe not with other WP blogs) it goes fine.

It usually means that the AddType for *.php files is missing. Without
knowing to parse these files, it merely sends the PHP file to the user as an
application/x-ocelot-stream, which prompts Firefox to open a Save As dialog
box.

@Roland: Either contact your host or, if this is on your own server, look at
one of these links:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.php#install.unix.apache <-- if you
have Apache 1.3.x, look at steps 16 and 17 and search for them in your
httpd.conf. If they're not there, add them.

http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.apache2.php <-- if you have Apache
2.x, look at steps 16 and 17 and same as above.

If you're using IIS, you should use Apache. ;)

But, seriously, on IIS, I have no idea what could be causing this problem
except for a bad ISAPI filter.

That would sound reasonable but in practice (I've seen this on several
servers), WordPress displays some of the admin pages properly, and prompts
the user to save the php file for other pages. This leads me to think that
the issue is related to the headers sent by WordPress at one point or
another.

My php4.conf file looks like this:
<IfModule mod_php4.c>
  AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3
  AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
</IfModule>

I have Apache2 on Debian Sarge (Stable) here. Latest packages and security

Hmmmm. I have Linux here with some extensions. Shall I make a screenshot of 
the extension box so you can compare it with your list?

So I'm the only one in the whole universe with this "thing" ?

When I read all this, I came to the conclusion that my extensions might cause 
this?

Well, this also happens with FF on my computer at workplace. So I will 
screenshot there everthing and send it to Mozilla and to this list.

If you send a stream of ocelots after a red panda, it better be
running for its life, not stopping to open up a dialog with anyone.

I guess you're right. People don't touch 'code' until the know what it 
means.
Well, some do - you may have seen the horrific results some time.
I guess 'Normal' and 'Code' would be simple and useful.

Reason:
Those who not code will find WYSIWYG normal and those who do code will 
find code normal.

Sure, I've seen it happen on perfectly configured when the server is 
under a lot of load. I have no idea what causes it, if you open up the 
downloaded file it's usually blank. I've seen it happen on non-WP code 
so I don't think it's something inside of WordPress.

Figure it out - will ya? LOL. I actually got a PHPBB site that I run which
does the same thing also. It does seem to happen under very heavy traffic
times, so I kind of wonder if it is a combination of number of spawned
daemons -vs- php being able to handle the load.

I think it probably has something to do with that high load causing the 
PHP process to choke and die, thus leaving the webserver with ... well, 
not much.

That's the one, yep. Prompts me to think: Could it be some kind of out of
memory error that would occur after the headers are sent or something
equally awkward to detect?

Anyway... thanks for the highlight on the server load. Much appreciated. :-)

You wouldn't happen to be running XGL/Compiz would you? Older versions
of gnome-window-decorator have a problem with window titlebars not
updating. Or are you using Windows?

It has been around since 1.5 and as far as I can see it is a lovely wrapper
to the usermeta table (locally caching metadata, not overwriting exiting
values if required etc)

I might be wrong, but aren't WP's built-in user meta functions fine for
almost all purposes? I've never messed around with usermeta so I might be
missing something here...

While on this topic, what should be done to store a list of values  
for a user? Let's say I wanted to 1-5 urls for each user. Does the  
{userid,metakey} tuple have to be unique, or can I add/retrieve  
records like

id, uid, metakey, metavalue
45, 1,      theurl,   http://google.com
45, 1,      theurl,   http://wordpress.com
45, 1,      theurl,   http://example.com

I believe that the above cannot be done. As an alternative, a  
serialized array of urls could be stuffed into the metavalue, which  
is a `longtext`. Assuming that urls don't get long or numerous, this  
could work. What's the preferred method of storing a list of user  
metadata?

Message-ID: <451B3C6F.7060505@plumlee.org>

Not particular to Wordpress most likely, but hopefully someone has seen 
this.

Been attempting to get a local copy of a production Wordpress site 
running on a laptop for testing.  Did a database dump, run a perl script 
across it to replace the site name with the local site name, then 
another perl script to adjust some serialized values (the site name goes 
from ABCD.com to ABCD.com:8000, so I'm adjusting the value of the string 
length indicator for those values to be 5 characters longer) and then 
load on the laptop.

Anyone know if adjusting the serialization values in Wordpress this way 
would break the unserialization?

The only thing that is strange is that only ONE particular value (for a 
plugin, it's in the wp_options table) seem to NOT be unserialized 
correctly.  Most of the values seem fine, but this one in particular is 
no longer recognized as an array.

Anyone seen something like this before with Wordpress?  The original 
machine is a FreeBSD server with PHP 4.4.2 and MySQL 4.1.18, the laptop 
is a Mac running PHP 4.4.1 and MySQL 4.1.21. Changelogs for PHP and 
MySQL don't seem to have something particular that would be about this.

Getting back on track - there seems to be some interest from lots of
users to get tagging support. An updated Windows Live Writer has also
just been released which has built-in tagging support, it would be so
cool if Wordpress could access these tags too!

Sorry for what's probably a newbie question, but what blog scripts and
spiders are expected to consume the output?

I think it's worth moving toward Atom, since it solves several issues with
RSS (no namespace, lots of random extensions, no central place to discover
extensions, horrible parenting, etc.).

Okay, so you could just set $more = true; ... but it never hurts to

See the function get_the_content() to see where $more is implemented.

Yeah, I think you have to change not only the string in question, but 
also the definition of how long the string is.

something like
  "s:5,s:abcdef"  ->  "s:6,s:abcdef"

I've never had a problem.  I wouldn't bother.  Most issues will be  
related to major WP upgrades breaking plugins with antiquated code.

BTW, My upgrade "script":

$ cd ~/www/wp/

I've implemented the same function without the presence of the more
expansion code...

It's in my CompleteRSS plugin, you can get it here:
http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=2

The source
(http://neosmart.net/mint/pepper/orderedlist/downloads/download.php?file=htt
p%3A//neosmart.net/downloads/software/WordPress/Plugins/CompleteRSS/Complete
RSS_0.2.phps) is moderately commented, it's the section
"NST_get_the_content" and it's original WP "get_the_content" but without the
splitting code (notice how slim it gets!!)

My host didn't, but all I had to do was ask... (L) Micfo!!

;-)

Anyway, why --force? I haven't ever used it... just
# svn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/trunk
# wget --delete-after http://neosmart.net/blog/wp-admin/upgrade.php?step=1

Am I missing something?

(or lftpget instead if host blocks wget for "security" reasons!)

Yes.  Use WP's built-in user meta functions:

        function get_usermeta( $user_id, $meta_key = '') {
        function update_usermeta( $user_id, $meta_key, $meta_value ) {
        function delete_usermeta( $user_id, $meta_key, $meta_value =  
'' ) {

It can't be done, unfortunately.  I wish usermeta had been designed

If not done correctly, it would.  Why not just feed the whole option  
value into your script, unserialize, change, serialize?

He's using export from the stable branches. This means that the .svn
folders are never made, so subversion doesn't think it has control
over the dir. --force forces it to voerwrite the files when it
exports, unlike if you just do export, where it would complain that
the file already exists

Sorry. I should clarify that I did that.  This would be one of my first 
attempts at using perl like this, so this is pretty ugly:

perl -p -i -e 
's!s:(\d+)(?{$val=5+$1}):"\\http:\/\/abcd!s:$^R:"\\http:\/\/abcd!g'

I'm adding :8000 to the name of the site, so I added 5 characters to the 
  string length.

I'm feeding the entire database dump into the script to globally change 
the site name, so I'm trying to keep it quick and easy.  And for some 
reason, this is the ONLY value that doesn't get read correctly.  At 
least, so far as I've noticed.

Thanks Robert!, don't know how I missed that export there...
I didn't know you could eport straight from the repo, I always thought you had to co then export from the checkout itself..

Don't know if this helps anyone, but I usually keep track of the latest 
svn revision that I'm on, and the revision that WP is up to, then do:

svn diff -r1:2 > wp-1-2.diff
(where 1 was my old revision and 2 the new revision number)

Then go to my WP install and do:
patch -p0 < /path/to/wp-1-2.diff

This has the advantage of keeping any local changes from being 
overwritten, so long as they don't conflict (and if they do, patch will 
tell you and it's usually an easy task to manually fix just those bite)

Also, you don't have to worry about your host installing subversion 
because you can create the diff locally, and just copy it over (or you 
could do the whole thing locally and copy the whole thing over when you 
are satisfied with the results)

Just a thought,

Yeah - not all of us are so lucky...  I expect I could get install it myself
if I ever really cared to.  But this new version of the script should allow
you to change a 0 to a 1 and grab nightly builds.  Put in crontab, it would
meet my needs if I cared to go with a liver blog without SVN.

>--delete-after  

I did not know of this parameter!  I have some cron tasks that will benefit
from this.  I can delete the following rm commands.  Thank you!

It sounds like all is good for this process.  Thanks for all of the
responses.

Message-ID: <d54e183d0609280819t3714aed9m7eeee11ba4ddeed7@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on some very funky stuff in a theme, and I found one strange
thing just by accident. Certain things I do, like self-submitting forms
don't work if I use the get_header() function, but they work just fine if I
use a regular php include('header.php') or what have you.

I was wondering if anyone on this list has had a similar problem. Also, if
anyone happens to come across this again, it's nice to know there is a
workaround. I'm not user why this difference would make-or-break stuff,
since get_header() should just be doing a similar thing to using a php
include()...?

Message-ID: <d54e183d0609280824j33ea8629g1ef3df71af371948@mail.gmail.com>

Another strange problem I've found (with an easy workaround) is that putting
the Template Name at the top of a template file causes some headers already
sent errors with some tricky self-submitting form stuff I've been doing with
themes.

Just to clarify, there are errors when I put this:

<?php /*
    Template Name: PunBB/WP Login
*/ ?>

... at the top of the template file - but no errors when I put it at the
bottom.

I just happened across this by chance, and there's a workaround, so I'm not
that worried about it. I just thought that somebody on this list might have
come across a similar problem, or maybe somebody can explain why it's
happening...?

Thanks,

The thing that is likely to cause the headers already sent stuff is blank
lines either before or after the comment section with the template info in
it.

That is strange since PHP comments are not sent. Check to make sure  
you don't have spaces or blanks line before or after the template  
name section. I would guess that WP will have to read your entire  
template file if you place the template  name section at the bottom.  
Have not checked the code. I could be wrong.

Paul, yeah - it was a blank line between the template name and the call to
include the header. I wouldn't have thought that would cause a problem, but
here we are! Thanks again.

Remember, when using get_header() you will lose a lot of previously 
defined variables because the inclusion happens inside a function.

The list of what variables do get "globaled" in to your include is in 
the function load_template here

(For the dev branch, anyway)

Ah, I guess I missed the point here: Export format means that you download the

So many good reasons to change over. :-) I don't know ATOM but I believe in

I am trying to provide a method to edit a database field that my

this is have my plugin prepend a text string to the content as it goes
out over xml-rpc, and strip it back out as it comes in. The latter is
easy with content_save_pre, however format_to_edit doesn't seem to
affect xml-rpc data. Does anyone know of a filter that does?

I'd benefit from there being a "stable" branch of WordPress.  Right  
now it'd point to 2.0.4, and when 2.0.5 comes out, it'd point to  
that.  When 2.1 comes out, it'll point to that.  Basically, just the  
most recent official release.

No development should go on there -- it should only be updated when a  
new WP version is released.

I have a lot of WP sites to sync, and it'd help if I could just point  
them at that branch and forget about it.  Anyone else think that's a  
good idea?

That's more of a tag than a branch.  Can't you just "svn switch" to the 
2.0.5 tag when it comes out?

Tags are supposed to be frozen... snapshots in time.  Basically a  
revision number given a name.

I could svn switch to the 2.0.5 tag when it comes out, but that  
requires manual intervention... not as simple as setting a cron job  
to svn up to /branches/stable/

+1.

I run Dad's blog off the 2.0 branch currently because I don't want to
spent ages fixing 2.1 problems (I don't mind doing it for my own blog
- it's fun!) but don't want to spend ages doing upgrades when I have
the convenience of a "svn up" running from a cron job.

Having a "stable" branch would really benefit me.

Seconded.

It might be easier than that though... couldn't a symlink on the repo server take care of all that without a need to actually link the latest content? 
No need to actually physically copy or sync the branch/tag, just ln the code to the new DIR... 

I think it would work, but I've never tried it. Does SVN support ln?

Only on *nix, I believe.  It doesn't have it's own links, as far as I 
know, but will accept a filesystem link as just another thing to version.

It *is* on *nix ATM though, isn't it?
Client OS obviously doesn't matter... so so long as automatic has it on a ln-capable server.....

Worth a shot?

svn copying to the same branch over-and-over doesn't work that well 
because moves and deletes are not accounted for.  We might be able to 
svn merge but that can get messy.

That will get messy and hard to track.

How about a REST webservice (as was discussed before with regard to the
Update Notification stuff to go into core which I need to update for
current trunk - see http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1476)

If we have some REST services on wordpress.org like the following:

http://rest.wordpress.org/1.0/stabletag

Which returns the full path to the current stable wordpress version tag
all this nifty cron jobs can just use that to do svn switches as
necessary.

We then would also have:

http://rest.wordpress.org/1.0/lastestversion

Which returns the version string of the latest version.

http://rest.wordpress.org/1.0/releasenotes

Which returns a link to the blog post announcing the latest version.

http://rest.wordpress.org/1.0/updateseverity

Which returns a string from the enum [critical|recommended|informational]
these are used to grade the update where security issues which are present
in a default install would be rated critical, those which require
non-default options (like for example enabling registration could be
recommended) and major version iterations would be informational.

Thoughts?

Probably not. Subversion has two backends, one uses Berkeley database 
(bdb) the other uses the filesystem as backing (fsfs). Like CVS, you 
probably shouldn't mess with the repository. That includes symbolic 
links (and if they use bdb then it is a moot point anyway).

What if you just kept up-to-date using /branches/2.0?

Or even better, rather than changing the repository (i.e. forcing the 
devs to *move* a tag every time a new release is made, in addition to 
the tag that is normally made for each release), change your update 
scripts to dynamically select the revision to grab.

One option would be to look at all the tags and figure out which one 
looks like the latest, and update to that tag.

Another option (probably safer, and certainly easier) is to have your 
script grab a particular URL that you control and inside its contents 
you have the tag name, then have your svn update script use that tag. If 
you want to push all your wordpress installs to a new revision, just put 
the new tag name into the url and wait until the following morning (or 
whenever) for the upgrade script to run. Best part is that the WP devs 
don't need to do anything to make this work.

Just a thought,

Just a thought - does SVN support HTTP redirects? If so, instead of
"reporting" the location with a REST service, you could simply do a
HTTP redirect from a fixed url
(http://static.wordpress.org/svn/latest) to the latest tag.

Unfortunately not, Jeremy.

It's not a "web server" so to speak, it's a version-control system. Technically speaking, whatever file you put in there will be treated as a static file (with some svn-specific things), so even if it is hosted on Apache or whatnot, it'll treat .htaccess files as data in its own way...

I use it to sync .htaccess files across servers as a matter of fact ;-)

Redirect's don't work:

With the following .htaccess:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /wp/
RewriteRule ^latest$ https://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.0/
[R=301,L]

doing "svn co http://sandbox.ftwr.co.uk/wp/latest" gets

svn: PROPFIND request failed on '/wp/latest'
svn: PROPFIND of '/wp/latest': 301 Moved Permanently
(http://sandbox.ftwr.co.uk)

Even if this did work I think svn would get very pissed when the contents
of the root of the repo changed underneath it to not be the same url.

AFAIK, SVN does NOT store the individual source files (nor their
sequential diffs) as actual files on the filesystem ala CVS; rather, it
uses a Berkeley DB backend or binary files on-disk to encapsulate the
repo data.  This has been one of the reasons we haven't seen massive
adoption of SVN internally - there's a fear that, if something goes
wrong, there's no way to even attempt to rescue a few of the most
important files in the same way that CVS, RCS or even SCCS (*shudder*) do.

Engineers are a skittish lot and really prefer that you not lose their
hard work, thankyouverymuch.  *grin*

Think outside the box.  The .htaccess file doesn't need to be in the SVN
branch. It can be right at http://static.wordpress.org/ (no SVN involved at
that level) and still catch the specific url in question even if it is a
mile deep within the SVN structure.

We'd just have to create a TRAC issue so that this is done during the
release.  Are there standard TRAC issues that are created and marked as
complete for each planned release?  And if so, is that an automated process
or does someone have to go through and duplicated the issues form one track
to another?  Just curious....

BTW +1 on the implied switch to the term "latest" instead of "stable".  All
of the previous release were reportedly "stable" when released into the
wild. But you want the LAG (latest and greatest) version.  And we already
have the term "latest" used in the release structure...

When you want to get the LAG release via HTTP, no matter what its label, you
go to this url: http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz

So, "we" should be consistent across the board.  I think....

I agree with that sentiment! However I don't understand the concern about
the Berkeley DB backend.  Is there an inherent stability issue with BDB?  Or
are you people just concerned about the info being in a DB rather than a
file system?  StarTeam, the versioning system with which I'm most familiar,
stores your versioning info in a MS SQL* db.  That just means that your
backup procedure has to include the database.  There are plenty of mission
critical operations that depend on MS SQL DB data never being lost.  So,
after implementing our procedures (RAID (grin), Backups and etc), we feel
quite safe and haven't lost any code since the switch over to MySQL.


*You could also use other backends like MS Access if you REALLY want to
stress that backup system... When our StarTeam system was setup in the mid
90s we used MS Access and definitely had corruptions over the years...  But
then again, that's one thing large Access DBs are known for...

+1 from here.

The ability 'svn up' would be nice instead of having to 'svn switch'
or usually in my case, I somehow end up with a corrupted svn copy and
have to 'svn export --force' to get the latest release from
/branches/x

At the end of the day, you probably don't want fully automatic upgrading 
as you don't know if the "stable" release of 2.1 (or 2.0) is going to 
break something you have.

My best guess would be a well-scripted way to SVN SWITCH several 
installs would be the safest.

You're not looking at this as an engineer.  Backups run nightly, meaning
that it's quite possible to lose up to and including an entire working
day's worth of work.  Most use cvs as a real-time backup option,
checking in intermediate versions/working copies of stuff that's only
halfway to compilation-ready status so that they can have the security
of knowing they have copies out the wazoo ready to fall back on. In
these situations, falling back to last night's tape is cold comfort for
engineers who lost 4 man-hours of blood, sweat n' tears to a protracted
fight with gcc.

CVS lets said engineers get at the raw files and diffs which could
theoretically allow them to reconstruct a valid codebase BY HAND,
whereas SVN uses binary files or DBs to obscure the code in such a
fashion as to make such by-hand reconstructions difficult, to say the least.

If your _that_ paranoid about losing your changes you can use the svn hook
scripts to run svnadmin hotcopy [1] or svnadmin dump --incremental to
ensure you always have a backup of your repository.

That way you don't need to rebuild your broken repo as you always have a
backup.

Ahhh, but see, you're making the classic mistake of assuming that you're
dealing with 1) rational actors who 2) read documentation.  I don't know
how much time you've spent in the corporate world, but those are both
highly specious claims to make in any company with over 10 full-time
employees. *grin*

It's a plain and simple fact: Users. Don't. Read.  One has to hand-hold
through the muddy valleys of actual use cases in order to get 'em to the
grassy fields of self-sufficiency whose wide vistas and uncharted
territories oftentimes frighten users to such an extent that they're
still unwilling to venture off on their own or (Quel shock! Quel
horreur!) enter a search string into Google to find their own darn answers.

And, if anyone's interested, I have a whole closet full of cynicism at
home that I can put up on eBay, because I certainly can't use it all.

OK, I see your concern.  I'm sure your stuff is working well for you, but if
this info helps in some future meeting, I figured I'd share...  We handle
the need for a live backups though Database Mirroring.  It is very similar
to what you describe for file system, but with database tables.  In many
other engines, including a Berkeley DB and MySQL, it's known as Replication.
Basically all writes on a master server are automatically passed to one or
more clients.  That allows not only load spreading by creating multiple
query servers, but also creates a live backup that can easily be promoted to
a master - even if it is kept off site.

Here's BDB's take on database mirroring:
http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/rep/intro.html

It's not something I'll ever use for BDB but if I ever find a sweet spot and
end up with an incredibly popular WordPress site, I figured I would use it
for the WordPress DB...  If you have *AMP at home, it should be a really
easy way ensure you have a good offsite backup of your site that can go live
in seconds or be fodder for a quick and complete restore...
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/replication-howto.html

I should try it in the RW and make a post about it sometime...  I've not
played with it under MySQL yet.  BTW - this does not protect against having
your site attacked.  All writes/deletes, good and bad, are mirrored to the
other db.  So, this is not a replacement for full and rotating backups.

Not complete convinced by this.

To me they work well where they are...

If we are to start moving the options around they need to stay under  
options for one thing - it may be better to review all the current  
options and try and come up with some simpler heading and better  
groupings.

We could also extend the install process (in 2.5 i would think as  
this needs thrashing out) so as to expose some more of the core  
configuration options at install time.

I say that the whole admin panel could well be redone. Don't know what
happened to the Shuttle project, but I digress.
I think that there a lot of opinions on how the admin panel should be
structured, and many of them have been voiced here in the mailing lists
often. There seems to be little consensus, but a lot of opinions.

I suppose, Lloyd, you've opened a can of worms here! :) The back end needs
an honest-to-goodness examination by usability folks. Plugins and such add
menus on a whim and I find myself stumbling through the menus trying to
figure out where to change this or switch off that. Is it under MANAGE? No.
OPTIONS? There it is. Oh, wait, part of the plugin settings are in OPTIONS
and the other part is in MANAGE. HUH?

This job is not unlike herding cats, I suspect.

Odd, $_POST is a super global and should always be accessible. For 
otherwise set variables, you can just

<?php
// your template
global $missing_var;

?>

to regain access to it.

Bah, you're right.  That's not fun.  I guess I'll just do it the ugly  
way (the svn rm * way) myself on my own SVN server.  Actually, that's  
not a bad idea anyway, because I can bundle commonly-used plugins in  
the repository as well, and those will be automatically updated for  
clients.

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/89039

Hi
 when trying to open some WordPress URLs Firefox has started to 
interpret it as trying to open some kind of application. This happens on 
only some machines (both PC & Mac) and not others.

I notice that there is usually a trailing backslash involved, and the 
page opens fine if manually removing said backslash.

Seems the phenomena is spreading so thought I'd mention it here, hope 
it's not too off topic.

Forget proprietary software and its issuese:
Just install a shadow-copying service on the PC, and use hardware (RAID) mirroring.
Shadow-copying prevents damage from software-related things (and human "errors"), while the RAID protects the hardware-side of the picture.

In my experience that's always been the best way to keep things secure *without* the hassle, cost, and slow-downs associated with daily backups and manual recoveries.

That support is actually from a plug-in. The current version of Wordpress
doesn't support video embeds. I believe 2.1 is going to support it.
Currently I am doing embeds with the TinyMCE editor and enabling the flash
plugin that comes with TinyMCE.

I don't think 2.1 supports this natively.

This is something that wordpress.com does though I believe - probably
via a plugin to wordpress-mu

Thanks,  folks. I was misinformed by the guys at Netscape. I
thought  that support was native, so I suspect that, judging

WordPress.com with or without enhancements.

Best wishes,
