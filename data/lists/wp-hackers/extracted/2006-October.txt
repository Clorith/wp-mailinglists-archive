Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin suggestion - archives
Message-ID: <451F8ACE.1040802@tamba2.org.uk>

This came from the .com support but it's valid for core I reckon.

Archives. In a default wp install click an archive month and all you get
is a list of posts. For prolific posters that's a long page. There is no
way to display by cat/tag, author or any other criteria.
There are plugins out there than can do this and as WP blogs come toward
their 3rd year it's getting to be a lot of archives. I don't think this
has been addressed at all since WP 1.0 has it?

Message-ID: <200610011319.45037.webmaster@mxchange.org>

Hello,

I have now released the first alpha-version of my SQL cacher. There are still 
bugs in this piece of software. E.g. cache files with same content. They 
shall normally not be created but it looks like the allocation table is not 
working probably.

You may want to check-out my dev-blog (sorry hacker-blog) entry here:
http://blog.mxchange.org/trunk/2006/10/01/sql-cacher-still-in-alpha-stadium/

Your comments and suggestions are all welcome.

Greets,

When I develop a theme, I generally make changes to any of the 'archive'
pages (this includes category, archives and search)
In the template pages (category.php;archive.php;date.php;etc.) I switch
the_content() for the_excerpt().

I've also been making the post list to use <dl> tags.

There's talk of getting the WordPress 2.0 series into Debian Stable. 
This would require that the 2.0 branch be maintained for 3 - 5 years. 
Are we up for maintaining security updates to 2.0 for that long?  If 
not, WP will not be in Debian stable but will continue to live in Debian 
unstable/testing.  Anyone feel strongly enough to help maintain 2.0 for 
several years?

I can also update WP by hand. Its not so much work. :-) But to speak for 
people who has 10+ blogs this might be helpful.

For my own I'm already exhausted by other projects. Sorry you have to wait for 
other replies. :-)

If nobody else feels terribly strongly about it, I would be willing to
help maintain the 2.0 branch for any bugfix/security issues that may
arise. I'm sure that whoever takes on the project won't be alone in
maintaining it.

"Maintain"

That just means that we issue security fixes, right?
And, like if in 5 years WP 2.0 doesn't work on MySQL 9, does "maintain" involve making it work?
Also, do you mean 2.0 or 2.x?

:D

Definitely 2.0, as the next version is still in alphas and Debian
Stable would never consider alpha software for inclusion.

Doug, there's a website you can go look at if you care. I'll spare the
rest of you folks my rebuttle.

Wordpress 1.x is less than 2 - 5 years old and it is no longer
maintained.  I don't expect 2.0.x to hang around too long after 2.1
comes out.

It'll come out..... but with more bugs than features, more holes than mouse-infested swiss cheese, an ugly interface that doesn't load on anything newer than IE4, and not before Duke Nukem Forever comes out.

But that's besides the point: phpBB2 is ancient :D

Hi Andre,

This topic was recently discussed on this mailing list in a thread
titled "Firefox vs. WP"

"I've seen it happen on perfectly configured when the server is  under
a lot of load. I have no idea what causes it, if you open up the
downloaded file it's usually blank. I've seen it happen on non-WP code
 so I don't think it's something inside of WordPress."
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-September/008787.html

This seems to agree with my own experience and others on the list.

Seeing the condition clear when removing the backslash may be a red
herring if the issue is timing / load related.

You write that "this happens on only some machines (both PC & Mac) and
not others". Is it reproducible always on those computers? How often
does it occur on those computers? Is it only on particular sites?

Being also involved in Flock and Firefox development I am interesting
if the "phenomena is spreading". What makes you suggest this?

Has anyone seen it in IE, even if not, IE could be working around a
server side problem... maybe as simply as re-requesting a page. Who
can say without the source.

Thank you,
Lloyd

Hello,

I was the one who started the topic. :-)

I have "fixed" this issue by reducing the number of spawned threads of the 
Apache process and increasing the memory limit in php.ini:

128M in php.ini and the following settings in apache2.conf:

<IfModule prefork.c>
StartServers         5
MinSpareServers      5
MaxSpareServers     10
MaxClients          16
MaxRequestsPerChild  500
</IfModule>

I have "just" 512 MB RAM and 1 Gig swap here on my server. Kinda low for today 
but it's still a good exercise for me to write low-memory-usage scripts. :-)

This might be related to APC as well. I have increased the APC shm_size 
to see if this behaviour goes away. Roland, do you have APC enabled?
If this does not solve my issues, I might disable APC and see if it goes 
away.

Nope, sorry. :-/ Btw: what is APC?

Its working here. If you have a RAM-based cacher then give more RAM for 
PHP. :-) Without my SQL cacher I can have 64 enabled. But maybe this is not 
exactly the fix but currently I have no more problems. :-)

I didn't have a lot of time on the site where this was happening - at 
the co. for whom I have set up the site, it does this on three of about 
six machines, always the same page (+ Wordpress root folder, i.e. 'view 
site' admin panel link)

[ Okay, maybe this is a good time to admit that I've broken the 
WordPress site's pagination in order to sort 'post' lists by all kinds 
of weird and wonderful customised grouped orders - but this issue 
doesn't seem to affect those views per s?, but that plus a lot of UTW 
links has me a bit nervous that I may be inflicting unusually cruel and 
nasty demands on the shared server (@ 123ehost) :-{ ?. Still, it was all 
working fine up until last week sometime, will check with the ISP if 
they've recently changed anything.]

Admittedly that statement may have been a bit premature, about an hour 
after posting this in the forum a response was posted saying: "That 
happens with my Firefox on just about every site I land on ..." (LynnR, 
I'm BCCing her, perhaps she would be so kind as to supply more examples 
to look into). However briefly searching the forum nothing similar comes 
up, except for one thread 
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/84555?replies=11 where the problem 
was 'resolved' by reinstalling firefox with a new profile - which seems 
like sweeping it under the carpet.

Unfortunately I'll only be able to go to the site where I know this is 
happening again next weekend :-(

Thanx for all the input

Andr?

Indeed.  I talked to the Debian folks and committed to maintaining the 
2.0.x series for the next several years.

Hello,

does someone use WP-Medic in his/her WP installation?

I just want to say that I have "hacked" wp-medic to get it working with 
2.0.4 :-)

Here is my little patch:

It can't be that hard to maintain. I mean MediaWiki has three different

I take it you are volunteering?

Maintaining a package in Debian stable is a big commitment. Three
years is forever in Internet time. For us that find 2.0 does
everything we need -- sshhh -- this is more generally a commitment for
security maintenance for the same length of time. Thank you Ryan for
taking this on!

I don't know what you mean by MediaWiki has three different versions
going. I find *zero* packages of mediawiki in Debian stable.

If GPL'd there is also the opportunity to collaborate on having
wp-medic added to wp-plugins.org .

It seems that to keep signal to noise as high as possible, plugin
announcements are discouraged from wp-hackers.

I think I was told the Plugins and Hacks forum was a good place for
such announcements

I'm not kidding here. The kernel32.dll has not (!) been changed so much since 
Win3.1 (or 3.11?) Only some very minor things has been added/changed there.

This is what is said in computer clubs and I have heard this from different 
people, too.

If you don't mind, would you e-mail me a zip of the original plugin if
you have it as well? It actually belongs to Firas and myself, and its
one of the things I lost in my server crash and haven't been able to
recover. Its one of the things that I used to have new unreleased code
for but don't anymore, but I still need to put this one back out
there.

I personally have been here for years and don't ever remember
complaints about plugin announcements. Wouldn't your time be better
spent working on something else, like the debate on what remains
unmaintained for the longest?

I don't have strong feelings about plugin announcements on this list.
My suggestion was based on what "seems" to be the case to me. I think
if we started seeing many plugin announcements and the plugin
discussions that would result, it would change the dynamics of this
list.

I have only been lurking on this list since mid-May, and I don't
recall seeing plugin announcements. Since following this list more
closely for the last couple of months, I have seen people get "shot
down" for non-"core" discussions.

What is your intention of your statement/question about my time? I
haven't found a positive implication.

Except, in addition to the core app, you are also forgetting about all of us

I get it know. I asked on IRC, I did not understand what discussion he
was referring to. I had stopped reading that other thread when it
mentioned Windows. I thought he might have been telling me to go do
real work -- which I try never to do.

Oh, I see, dang, I should not have invoked "signal to noise"

Message-ID: <cede70600610011959q60d4d170o5e53d87dcbd40ece@mail.gmail.com>

Hackers,

I am hoping to seek advice from a WPMU expert.

I have recently setup and configured a WPMU installation with ~20 blogs and
over ~40,000 articles. A single blog's article count ranges from only 72 to
over 15,000. I hope this is sufficient enough information as to the content
loaded into the system.

I am using a dedicated database server located on the server's LAN.

Hardware/Software Specs:
- Web Server
* P4 3.0GHz HT
* 2GB RAM
* 160GB IDE 7200RPM
* Litespeed Webserver (Std.)
- Database Server
* Dual 3.0Ghz Xeon
* 2GB RAM
* 160GB IDE 7200RPM

Here's the situation ...

With all the blogs configured (themes, plugins, etc..) I was only able to
squeeze max., 8 requests/sec.

Instead of going through all the plugins and theme customizations that are
bundled into this WPMU system I decided to run a second benchmark, using no
plugins and the default Kubrick WP theme.

Even then my benchmark maxes out at 33 requests/sec.

I am using the app 'http_load' to benchmark the system using the following
command:
$ http_load -parallel 5 -seconds 10 bench_urls

The 'bench_urls' file contains random locations to blog indexes, categories,
dates, articles, etc...

Given the information provided, where did I go wrong? I have to be missing
something big, as these numbers just don't make sense.

I am praying for a WPMU optimization solution.

Thanks,
Shayne

Yes we do support it in WordPress.com, and the syntax has been very 
popular and easy for people to use.

For WordPress similar functionality would be nice, but it'd probably be 
better left in the realm of a plugin. (Perhaps we can pluginize the code 
we use on WP.com.)

Message-ID: <45208951.5030503@mullenweg.com>

One of the biggest problems I think with WP is that our release cycle 
can be quite erratic. It makes it hard for people to plan around 
releases, because it's never quite sure when they're coming, and it also 
allows development to go far beyond when it should as more and more and 
more stuff happens.

2.1 still hasn't had a release, even though it's been very stable for 
months.

I think as an experiment after 2.1, we should aim to do a release 
exactly 120 days after when 2.1 comes out.

What could the release cycle look like?

2 months of crazy fun wild development where anything goes
1 month of polishing things a little bit, and performance
Feature freeze.
1 month of testing, with a public beta release at the beginning

After we're done and 2.2 is out, we can see how it went and decide where 
to go from there.

What do you folks think about trying this type of release schedule out?

that it sure helps with planning especially for someone who has to
update dozens of WordPress standalone installations everytime a new
version or patch is released. Mark J's "changed files" package release
sure helps quite a bit. imho, it should be made available official on
the site but i guess resources among developers are too limited. :)

btw, are there any plans to have future releases (or more on specific
set of features) of WordPress audited for security like what GulfTech
and Netcraft offers?

In general, yes.  There are thousands of plugins for WordPress and  
announcing every single one here would gum up the works.  But when a  
plugin is of wide appeal or of specific interest to the wp-hackers  
crowd, I don't see a problem with announcing it.  WP-Medic is like a  
hackers toolkit, which makes it pertinent to what we do here.  I also  
announced my WordPress 2.0.3 Tuneup plugin here, because at the time  
there were several seriously annoying bugs in 2.0.3 that would not be  
fixed until 2.0.4, which was several months off, and the plugin fixed  
those bugs.  I thought long and hard before posting it, because I  
didn't want to seem like I was hijacking the list for self-promotion,  
but I figured it was of general interest.

Well, to date WordPress has been played "by ear" where ideas just come along and people volunteer patches on trac to add certain functionality and stuff.
You can say that 100 days of patches will be accepted and 20 days code-lockdown with only improvements coming in, but that just doesn't sound like WordPress :)

It's more than just a release cycle, it's an entire way of development. WP is a loose collaboration of hackers that put together code. When "it feels ready" it goes out. 

120 day release cycles are nice and dependable, but they're just not us, are they?

Stupid question, but you *are* using local caching techniques?
I don't know if litespeed has url-rewriting, but consider using .httpd instead of .htaccess, that should help some

I thought a lot about that, because I like the casual-ness of 
development as well.

I think from most people's point of view, not much will change. It'll 
mostly be part of where ticket energy will be focused. Mostly what'll 
change is that for 30 days every few months we'll ignore or schedule 
feature tracs and focus on bugfixes. We do this now, but it's adhoc and 
no one knows it's coming.

I look forward to seeing the impact of a fixed length development
schedule and six months is what quite a few projects use. It is a nice
cycle for keeping relevant with the public, but more importantly a
regular, date based release cycle helps keep non-developer
contributors engaged.

Sounds good, so long as (god forbid) emergency bugs are still patched
immediately, unlike MS's "wait 'till Tuesday" model.

I wouldn't assume WP would follow that flawed model, just wanted to
get the question out there before things get set in stone...

Exactly. The somewhere else would typically be the unspecified killer  
blogging engine of the future.

Implementing this now benefits all blogging engines because it  
reduces the barrier to adoption. Users know they can trust their  
content to a system that supports a documented export format because  
they know they are not going to get locked in. I tried to explain  
this in the introduction to my document, which in case you've  
forgotten is at http://girtby.net/offerings/atomexport :)

Yes although I should point out that you don't have to support Atom  
syndication in order to support my Atom export proposal.

One of the advantages of using an Atom-based protocol is that there  
is the potential for code-sharing between syndication feed generation  
and content export. But there is no strict dependency.

I think this is a great plan. I'm among the confused by the current  
schedule. I think it will help a lot to have a more consistent  
release schedule. Even if you deviate from it, we'll have some  
concept of when we might expect new things to come.

suggested addenda:

- Extra-long wp-meetup session around week 2, to discuss proposed  
goals for the next version
- Put these goals up on Codex, but stress that they are not set in stone
- Weekly reviews of these goals, during the first two months (during  
wp-meetup).
- If, at the end of the two months, some of these goals are not yet  
implemented, we should push them off to the next version, and at that  
point we can release a list of major features that'll definitely  
appear in the next version (two months away, at this point).
- At feature freeze, we should document any API changes, or changes  
in best practices (i.e. deprecated functions or methods of  
accomplishing something).  This will give plugin authors one month to  
upgrade their plugins.

Reasons for those suggestions:

- plugin authors complaining that changes are not explained clearly,  
and that they don't have enough time to prepare, or don't even know  
when to start
- users/developers complaining about lack of milestones
- users/developers complaining about features that didn't make it

This schedule is only for major "point" releases, minor releases (2.1.x) 
would still be released as needed.

I would agree with these suggestions as long as each and every one of
those goals/milestones gets translated into their Trac equivalent so
that all of the development information is centralized. It would be
quite easy to get the Codex and Trac out of sync and create confusion
and dissent unnecessarily.  Since there are explicit concepts of
"milestones", "features", "tasks/tickets remaining", etc. on Trac, we
should use them to their fullest extent.

It's better to set up separate branches in the source repository so the 
crazy fun wild development can run in parallel with the testing and 
polishing.

We would continue to create branches for major releases to release

What would be the implications for the support forums?  Would they be
expected to provide support for both the "Debian" WP version as well
as the current version?

I'd imagine support would be for the latest 2.0.x version just as they
support the latest 1.5.x version. If WP releases a bugfix release, that will
become the support version for both WP and Debian WP. Right?

Unless  I  misinterpreted  something, I think  Elliotte  was
referring  to  the  need for constant  vigorous  development
where  testing  milestones are reached and future  extension
carries  on  simultaneously  (not only  bugfixes  for  older
supported  releases). A bit like stable and unstable Debian,
or  even  the  Kernel Mm tree that is maintained  by  Andrew
Morton.  I  suppose  that Fedora and RHEL would  be  another
example...  that  in  itself signals the need  for  multiple
patchmasters or maintainers, I think.

Again,  sorry  if I misinterpreted that short reply. I  just
think  that  have the 'cutting-edge' version  of  WordPress,
apart  from the one which is in its 2-month testing  period,
would be awesome!

Best wishes,

Roy

That's what I think Elliotte meant as well. I'd throw myself behind  
breaking it up into three branches (like Debian), unstable, testing  
and stable; however, implementing slightly differently to Debian: so,  
we move unstable to testing once we have the feature freeze (then  
starting a new unstable branch), with testing replacing stable at the  
end of the 4 month release cycle.

Yes, that's correct. The main example I was thinking of was 
Firefox/Mozilla. I don't think work on new features necessarily needs to 
stop just because the upcoming release is in lockdown mode.

These approaches are responses to need in those projects. For example
the needs of QA and localization to get their work done after
development has completed, a developer to work on something that will
not be ready for months, or a marketing team that needs releases to
launch in favorable market conditions.

Lets demonstrate the need before planning the perfect project.

Having as much of the development community focused on a release is
often the best way to get that release done and move on to working on
the next fun thing.

Thank you,
Lloyd

PS. Linux distributions are generally poor comparison points because a
large part is its role as a publisher of other projects, and its
dependencies on those other projects schedules.

>Three major releases a year is an awesome challenge.

I expect everyone here knows the axiom:
"Speed (of the release), Quality (of the release), Price (of the release) -
pick two" 

The "price" or "cost" is already set for WordPress release.  This is a
volunteer project.  The people working on the core now, are gonna be,
roughly, the same people who are working on it under a 120 day schedule.  In
fact, a few people might drop off as it moves from sounding like fun to
sounding like work.  It could go the other way too, I suppose; I guess we'll
see.  But chances are that full time people are not gonna be hired just to
meet that 120 day goal. I could be wrong, but I don't think there's gonna be
an extra 10 or 20 grand tossed into the pool to increase the workforce
temporarily.  So, the "price" of a release is set.

The "Speed" of the release will now be set too.  120 days. Period.  A hard
deadline.

That means that it is only the quality of each release that will change.
I'm not saying that the schedule will make the release buggier.  What I am
saying is that you'll eventually have to make some hard choices about some
desired feature being dropped because it simply aren't ready for prime time.
That could make a release very thin - if a major feature (the major feature)
just isn't up to snuff.  Right now, WordPress would just slip the time/speed
of the release and fix the problem.  The 120 day hard release would
eliminate that possibility.  That is if you are saying it is a hard
deadline...*  

If it is a 120 day "goal", that makes life a little easier.  You shoot for
120 days, but it might be 140 or 150...  That's probably better than what is
done now.  It is a still a jump to the other side of the scale, but it is
probably more realistic...  

All of this is to say, that you really need to decide now, how you want to
handle that choice you'll eventually face.  Is it: 120 days is 120 days is
120 days; features be damned**.  Or when push comes to shove, will you, 1
month out, choose to continue to work on the next big thing even though you
have significant problems in it still and you know you might not get a
quality code freeze.  Something for Matt and Ryan to think about...


(* Additionally, with a young project like WordPress, the features come fast
and furious.  As the project matures, you're gonna have to start thinking a
little more strategically and put more time into planning.  Plus big
features will need to be worked on for a longer period of time and that
takes resources from the current release.  That 2 months of free for all
development will be eaten up by more and more design time as the future robs
from the present resources.)
(** Sorry - I don't swear, but nothing else fit there and the literal
meaning applies...)

Another thought about this.  If the developers do commit to a 120 day 
release cycle, then should the version numbering become consistent? IE, 
we should now see 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc etc.  If I remember right (aha, see 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_1.6), 1.6 was skipped because the 
changes were so major between 1.5 and 2.0 that a new major version 
number was wanted.

OpenBSD (just picking one I'm familiar with) rolls out 2 releases a 
year.  May and November, and the version number goes up by .1 each time. 
  Doesn't matter what the changes, it's always a .1 increase.  This way, 
it's very clear what's the latest version, what the previous was, and 
what the upgrade path is.  And releases are not longer supported after 2 
new versions (when 4.0 comes out, 3.7 is deprecated).

 From a (shudder) marketing standpoint, it may not be as sexy to only go 
from 2.1 to 2.2 to 2.3.  Most commercial software seems to like jumping 
up versions to give the feel that more has been done, from what I can tell.

The Linux kernel used to use something like an even number for a stable 
release, and an odd for the development release.  So you got slightly 
faster numbering, but still consistency as to releases.

Just my two cents as 5 PM approaches.

Those two options make no sense. There is no decent explanation of what they
are for or how to use them in the panel. To be perfectly honest, I've never
understood these two fields. This is something that really needs to be
addressed. No pun intended.

I'm a strong advocate of version numbers having meaning.  If you want to
indicate time and quarter release. Do that, but make it only the public
version number: WordPress 2006 followed by WordPress 2006.1, WordPress 2006
rev 1, or WordPress 2006 SP1 

This has the additional benefit of the peer pressure, with the years
passing, forcing the masses to update.  "Ugh, you're still running WP2004???
Isn't that when you bought that Pentium II you just threw out?  You probably
still use MySpace too..."

But then have a internal number that actually means something to those who
know what they are talking about.  Have it mean something.  Then something
as vital as adding nonces to the security mix can get noticed.

+1.

Imho, the single most important point is to give some advance notice when a
release is around the corner. A month is good enough for this. A week is
not.

My $.02.

I have to agree that this is confusing.  I know what it means now and know
peoples who use it.  You can have your index.php in a parent directory and
your blog in a subdirectory underneath it.  I don't remember the benefit of
that, but that's the point of it.

The problem is that those two labels meant the same thing to most people
(including me).  I'll try to think up an alternative.  I expect someone here
can come up with a way to make a distinction between the two.

Aye.  And the Codex page linked below was even worse.  I cleaned it  
up a few days ago, but still... those labels should be explained  
better.  Maybe a line of explanation below each.  I'll whip up a patch.

There's another thing I'd like to do:

Edit index.php so that there is a commented-out  require_once() for  
WordPress in a /wp/ subdirectory.  That, plus a line of explanation,  
and maybe more people will figure out that you don't need to dump all  
those files in the root.

The only problem I see here is how big new features and new features  
from external developers get integrated. As it is supposed to work  
now, they exist as patches in Trac. If they sit for (potentially) 2  
months, it is likely that the patch will no longer fit. This puts the  
onus on outside devs to maintain/submit new patches through the 2  
month "polish and fix" part of the cycle.

I can also see potential for features to be dropped from a release  
somewhat indefinitely because of timeline. Coordinating large new  
features is a good reason for creating branches, which can merged  
back even several releases later when they are ready for "polish and  
test".

I'm not saying this is a bad idea - everything has trade-offs. I just  
thought I'd bring these points up.

Cheers,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Free JavaScript blowfish implementation?
Message-ID: <200610030041.01924.webmaster@mxchange.org>

Hello,

I'm searching here on the Net for a freely available blowfish implementation 
in JavaScript. For PHP I have already found one: 
http://www.koders.com/php/fidBE302167DA8C64B24344F8AAB9ED89EF031783C5.aspx?s=blowfish

Hmmm, one problem might come up here: How shall the JavaScript get the secret 
key from the server's harddisk?

What I want to do is to encrypt a currently in plain-text readable key in my 
HTML code so that simple regular expressions cannot find it.

Does someone know where I can find Blowfish? Or is there a "better" solution 
out? I really need this encryption for my plug-in here.

Some people (may) like to add some JavaScript pre-checking (e.g. useful for 
AJAX) to their plugins (contact forms, wherever the "blog reader" has to 
interact with the blog).

Currently you have to "hack" comments.php a little but what about a 
filter-based solution? So plugin coders can very easy add their JavaScript to 
a onsubmit and onreset "stub".

I you don't know what I mean please let me know it. :-)

Why not put the JavaScript in the header, via the wp_head action hook?

The reason for this is that some want to pre-check via this code:

<!-- Somewhere in the a-tag: //-->
onSubmit="return submitHook();" onReset="return resetHook();"

Now we "just" need to add something like this inside of the <form></form> 
comtainer and everyone is happy:

<?php wp_javascript(); ?>

Inside wp_javascript() we must check if the user wants to submit a comment or 
something else.

Just an idea. :-)

Mark,

That is the way I run all my client WP installs. I do this to keep  
the site root clean.

Put the engine into a folder, /wordpress/ under the site root, Copy  
the index.php into the root and add the path reference. This way the  
OPTIONS page values become:

WordPress address (URL):  http://www.mysite.com/wordpress
Blog address (URL): http://www.mysite.com/wordpress

Though I've also played with leaving these as:
WordPress address (URL):  /wordpress
Blog address (URL): /

Figuring the relative URLs will be properly translated by Apache. But  
have notice the some RSS items to not yield the full site URL. Have  
not had a chance to dig into this.

One thing I've often wondered about is why the full URL is stored as  
part of the Post guid field?

P-

You'll probably get more help and ideas on to solve whatever problem you try 
to solve if you explain what you want to achieve.

Include a reference to prototype or a prototype-like library in wp_head, 
and add an event observer:

Event.observe(window, 'load', function(e) {
$('commentform').appendChild(Builder.node("input", {
type: "hidden", name: "myfield", value: 'foo'});
// Or whatever
});

Dumping javascript into the page to run as it's downloaded might not be 
the best idea, especially since I've provided an example of how to do it 
well, but here you go:


add_action('comment_form', 'my_php_function', 1);

function my_php_function($postid) {
	echo "Post ID: {$postid}";
}


This hook is already in the default theme's template code.  See 
comments.php.

I mean a hook inside the <form> tag itself like:

<form <?php do_action('comment_form_tag', $post->ID); ?> action=".......>

So everyone can choose to add onSubmit and/or onReset to it or not. :-)

Okay, might be a non-WP question. But no, I code a plugin here which puts 
sensitive data into the HTML code. It's "just" a hash of several data from 
the server but this hash is the "secret key" which unlocks my CPR plugin 
(Comments Post Rewriter).

I have written this in general words because maybe someone knows where to get 
Blowfish JavaScript functions. :-/

Event.observe($('commentform'), 'submit', function(e) {
// The submit event code goes here.
});

Don't try to force PHP to do what you can already do more easily with 
javascript.

GUID is not "a place to store a canonical URL" or any such thing.
Changing the slug will invalidate the URL stored in the GUID, but the
GUID must remain unchanged. Storing the URL there is a quick-n-dirty
way to provide a string that will probably be Globally Unique.

If anyone would like to propose another way to generate a reasonable
GUID that is less confusing to db peekers, now's the time.

How about hashing the site url, time, and post id?

Andy,

Sorry. I didn't mean to touch a nerve or open a can of worms.

I will say I have been guilty of developing a site on my laptop or  
under a development URL. When the time comes to migrate to a  
production system, I will generally export the full database and  
change all references (including the post->guid and various options  
to the new production URL. Was not really sure what the GUID column  
was used for, Though as the name implies and you presented, this is a  
unique value.

I've not delved into this issue much deeper than what I've written  
here to see how/what/where/why the guid is used the way it is. These  
are things on my agenda to investigate one of these days.

The only I have is if this value must be unique, why is it not a  
unique key in the database. More specific, why is it not 'the' unique  
key?

I'm sure this could get into some deep discussion so feel free to  
tell me to GRTFC (Go Read the F***ing Code).

Because it's not the "ID" field, it's the "Globally Unique ID" field.

That means the value stored in that field must be unique not just for 
one site, but for any site anywhere.  The GUID is used, for one example, 
to differentiate posts on different sites for feed aggregators.

Presumably, if you switched sites and also changed the URL in your 
aggregator to the new setting, it would know not to re-load posts with 
the old GUIDs because they haven't changed.  Unfortunately, there is 
plenty of aggregator software that doesn't obey the spec, and when they 
ignore this, it causes some issues.  But you can also see why the GUID 
should not change when you change the slug.

You can't use the ID field of the posts table as the GUID because that 
value is *very* common among all blogs.  Creating hashes from existing 
data is never going to produce a more globally unique ID for a post than 
the actual URL for the post.

Hi Roland,
couldn't you rewrite your plugin to be an extension to the wonderful 
Spam Karma? Also take a look into Spam Karma to find a solution for your 
form-manipulation problem ... it has a similiar method of sending a 
md5-hash with each comments (but it doesn't block out people without 
javascript).

Secondly, wordpress is capable of manipulating the .htaccess file, your 
plugin isn't ... why? Also, fail gracefully instead of always dying on 
the user ... if something is not configured correctly or the server 
doesn't support certain functions DON'T EVER DIE! When do coders realize 
that everytime they do this god kills a cute little kitten? Don't do it! 
You may have learned that in a computational engineering class and it 
was a good practise, but it really sucks in the real world ... 
especially if it's a plugin that is killing the main application :-/

Just my 2 cents,
Sebastian

It's not *just* a unique key. It's used in Atom feeds for the `id`
element, for example, which is required by the spec to be a valid IRI.
In Atom 0.3 it was required to be a URI. That limits the format fairly
drastically.

Anyone looking into it should read this article by Mark Pilgrim: [1]

[1]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/28/howto-atom-id

He recommends using tag URIs [2]. Some examples:

    tag:timothy@hpl.hp.com,2001:web/externalHome
    tag:my-ids.com,2001-09-15:TimKindberg:presentations:UBath2004-05-19
    tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-555
    tag:diveintomark.org,2004-05-27:/archives/2004/05/27/howto-atom-linkblog

They're still readable and informative, but aren't going to be
mistaken for HTTP URLs. I don't think any of the other options are as
good.

That's actually a great point.  Many of us develop off 'test urls', which in 
cases could end up being NOT unique when the site is 'published'.  This then 
gets into going through the database and changing all the guids.  Maybe 
having an (advanced) override option for the guid 'prefix' would help in 
those cases -- even if it was a PHP variable with no interface (given that 
this is for >real< dev types!).

And let's not forget that we're using it as an actual URL for  
attachments.  We really should fix that for 2.1 ... people who move  
their blogs are left with broken images and the solution requires  
changing the GUID, which you're not supposed to do.

I don't know much about "litespeed" but I would recommend lighttpd. Also
look into caching that is part of PHP, not necessarily WordPress. I can't

I agree. If there was one XML-style import/export format, the world would be
a better place [not really, but still].

It lets users choose their blogging system, whereas some people I know stick
with MT because they don't want to go through all the "hassle" of importing
everything to a better platform, such as WordPress or Textpattern. No need
for "proprietary" formats, I deal with that enough with WMV and so on...

*Do* they support the latest 1.5.x version? I was under the impression that
it has been made obsolete and that everyone should upgrade to 2.x. I know
some people, such as Podz, still run 1.5.x at last check, with some
patching, but Podz can more than hack the code to fix any problem that might
come up... but I don't know about blogger Joe out there.

This is a problem more suited to the support forums,
http://wordpress.org/support/

But just to mention something, /?feed=rss2&p24 is *meant* to show the
comments for whatever post #24 is. With "pretty" links enabled, it would be
something like /2006/05/05/some-post/feed/.

It shouldn't be hard to make another file that takes only one post, selected
by ID from the URL (?p=2), then just show that file. If you don't know what
I'm talking about, the codex (http://codex.wordpress.org) might be a good
place for you to get familiar with WP's code.

Once again, though, the support forums are better for this kind of stuff.

It's actually not supposed to be good practice to include JS in the HTML
tags.

This is why libraries such as Prototype, which Owen mentioned above, exist.
Using events and DOM insertion, you can put the attributes in, with a script
that was included in the <head>.

Robin,

Litespeed is actually what Wordpress.com uses. According to their
benchmarks, Litespeed's, Litespeed is faster. My tests have also shown
numbers accurate to theirs. I've also tried Lighttpd in the past, both
Litespeed and Lighttpd are showing numbers much faster than Apache.

I am using a PHP caching as well, in fact, APC (Alternative PHP Cache). In
the past I have used eAccelerator too. Both provide op-code caching and APC
also has key based caching, similar to that of memcache.

I'm currently writing a caching plugin that acts similar to WP-Cache but is
computable with WPMU.

Still looking for some solution.

EEEEK.  +1...million!

All prior notes were that the guid is JUST a guid -- while it might LOOK 
like a URI, it shouldn't be USED as one.  Bad form! ;)

You can try out the memcached backend to the WP object cache.

In my tests, the memcache object-cache was slower than the same APC based
object-cache, not by much, but it was.

Not surprising.  If you need a distributed cache, though, memcached is nice.

If you know it, specifying the time in the 'm' argument seems to work:

For October 2nd, 2006 @ 14:35:01 <-- Local Time!

Works:  /?feed=rss2&m=20061002143501

It's still possible, though, that two posts will be published during  
the same second.

Note - if you fully specify the time with the other, easier to read  
arguments, you'll end up with the comments again.  If you leave out  
one argument, you'll get the post (but maybe some other posts as well).

Doesn't work: /? 
feed=rss2&year=2006&monthnum=10&day=02&hour=14&minute=35&second=01

Might work: /? 
feed=rss2&year=2006&monthnum=10&day=02&hour=14&minute=35 <-- seconds  
not specified

Having a scheduled realeases would be great, I think that a 4 month
cycle it's a bit short thinking to have 3 major version per year sound
a bit inrealistic, moving to a 6 month cycle can be a better choice,
tha 2 additional month can be used to:

1 month to see first ueser feedbacks and pallnning what to include
into next release... a peace period of no development but just brani
storming for next release could help to concentrate to have new
features well determined on "paper" with less chanche we shoudl revise
them after a large base of end users used them.

>What do you folks think about trying this type of release schedule out?

The 1 month test period with a beta would be a greta time for plugind
devs to upgrade theyr plugins and for we translators to have the new
locale ready with less rush than in the past.

This can be mostly sorted by branching before the beta release, making it so
big changes can still go in on the trunk, and only bugfix releases are
applied to the branch, that will probably work on the trunk as well.

I'm not sure that the above article applies to WordPress. If you visit 
the website of the FF extension used to generate the leak reports (see 
http://dbaron.org/mozilla/leak-monitor/) you find this text:

"This Firefox extension detects one very specific type of leak in chrome 
JavaScript and in Web pages. (Not in JavaScript components, though.) It 
detects when JavaScript objects in the chrome or Web page are still held 
by native code after the window is closed."

Basically the extension looks to be for firefox and firefox plugin devs, 
not website authors.

That said, there are rumors of actual javascript memory leaks floating 
around the web. In particular, IE seems to have trouble reclaiming 
memory in certain instances. 
http://laurens.vd.oever.nl/weblog/items2005/closures/ looks like fun. If 
you find that mozilla/firefox is not reclaiming memory after you 
navigate away from a page, that is a bug in firefox and should be fixed. 
Of course there isn't a good way to test this, so probably not worth 
worrying about unless someone finds a specific instance that is causing 
browser trouble.

A quick digression:
It is not always necessary for a program to "clean up" after itself. For 
example, if I were writing a small utility in C and (for example) I 
malloc() the size of a particular file, read the file in and count the 
number of lines and print out the total count (I know there are more 
efficient ways to write this, plus I could just use the wc program) 
there is no reason for me to call free(). Sure, a leak manager will 
report that my program "leaks" memory but since the program isn't 
designed to sit around, as soon as it terminates the memory will be 
reclaimed by the OS (if the OS forgets to reclaim that memory, that is a 
bug in the OS, NOT the program). All operating systems that I know of do 
just that.
The same applies to web browsers. If I were designing a webapp where the 
user never navigates away from a page and all interaction is done 
through AJAX (like gmail?), I would be concerned about memory leaks. But 
so long as the JS implementation cleans up once I navigate away (and 
everything I have read indicates that at least firefox seems to do this 
properly in most cases) memory management/leaks shouldn't matter.

Of course, a browser restart will always fix everything.

Summary: I don't think any cycles need to be wasted looking at JS leaks. 
WP doesn't even use _that_ much JS in the grand scheme of things.

In RSS 2.0, it has an attribute "ispermalink", which defaults to  
true. If it is not set, or is set to true, it can be used as one.

For internal development - yes. However WP has never (to my  
knowledge) used branching for this in the past. Doing so with this  
new release strategy makes sense, but there has to be a choice to use  
branches this way. So far, that part of the equation had not been  
part of the discussion (as far as I could tell from this thread).

Message-ID: <d54e183d0610031354y6e2344der9c6421e99495103c@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to convert an existing WP site I've got with many Pages (with
subpages, etc) into some kind of non-web format. I've seen some PDF
outputting plugins, but they don't seem to have a bulk one aside from this:
http://wp2pdf.sourceforge.net/. I'm wondering if anyone has used that?

The Staticize Reloaded plugin seems to be broken, and I haven't been able to
find anything else to fit this need.

So, if anyone has had to dump a WP site into static non-web content, please
speak up if you have any tips!

Thanks for any advice,

Just a quick observation:
No matter what you use as the GUID, exporting the entire MySQL DB and
putting it on the remote server means its not ging to be unique no
matter what. So URI or otherwise, exporting SQL from test to
production means there'll be a guid overlap in there somewhere. :-)

If you can produce PDFs of posts / pages via a plugin on demand, then 
wget or curl can easily handle the bulk processing.

I  have used it happily for over a year, but I suspect  that
it  /might/  not be fully compatible with 2.0.x. It  doesn't
appear to be maintained anymore (I tried to report some bugs
that I had fixed, to no avail). There are a few minor issues
like   restoration   from  MySQL  dumps,  which   may   drop
wp2pdf-specific  settings. Lastly, the nice thing about this
plugin/project  is  that  you can assemble  PDF's  in  large
batches    using   typical   filters/pseudo-'wildcards'   in
WordPress,  e.g. produce a document that contains all  posts
from September. This may suit you well.

You  can get a list of links (full URL's) to all your  posts
quite  easily.  I  would  personally  use  narchives.php  to
achieve  this although one SQL query might be enough.  Then,
put all the URL's, newline-separated in a file.

use wget in the following way:

wget -q  -erobots=off -i links_file.txt

Another approach (just a recursive crawl):

wget -q -r -nd -N -np -A.html -erobots=off http://example.org

Upload  file  to  server at end. They should  prevserve  the
directory  structure if you choose/set the right option (man
wget,   plenty of  stuff  there). To  avoid   breaking   old
(perma)links, careful attention and testing will be needed.

Hope it helps,

Roy

Not if 'hackers' had a way to set the GUID prefix in say wp-config, so a 
given local test-site's GUID's would be generated with the eventual 'real 
URI'... something like that.  Heck, I'd prefer to not store the WP site URLs 
in the DB, so that moving a site around becomes that much simpler (change 
something like wp-config, and not entries in the DB).  That's of course just 
IMHO. ;) :)

I read the blog entry, then I went to the page for the actual Leak Monitor 
Extension that he used to produce those pretty pictures.

Here is another quote from the page:
"If you see alerts when leaving Web pages, there's definitely a bug in Mozilla 
that should be filed"

There is a good chance that many of the mozilla bugs will be soon fixed if they 
have not been already. IE may have its own set of bugs, but the leak monitor 
extension is probably useless for helping out there...IE has its own JS/DOM 
implementation and any bugs that look similar to those in firefox are merely 
coincidental. JavaScript (when accessed from a webpage) does not require you do 
perform any manual memory management.

As far as I can tell, development on the minor branches 2.0.x and 1.5.x has
pretty much always lived on the branch, though I'm sure this would not
really phase anyone too much, allowing people to keep making big changes if
they so desire will outweigh the slightly change in procedure.

How about html2tex (or one of its derivates). Might be a bit of work but

I am running the theme viewer.

Every day I receive a massive amount of emails from the theme viewer, and
I must admit that i don't have 1/2-1 hour every day to go through all
mails. I, as far as possible, go through the mails once a week, and stops
when I have had enough. That is what's causing the delays some users
experience.


Sincerely,

If by "you" you mean the person writing the JavaScript, that's not really
true.  For example, if you want to support IE6 you need to be careful with
circular references, and understand how to avoid memory leaks when you must
use them.

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4339 = Awesome!!!

Is there a list of the new hooks or something? I'm trying to figure out how
I can add CSS... I'm looking for everything with do_action()...

Is this right...?

wp_logout
lost_password
login_head
lostpassword_post
retrieve_password
lost_password
lostpassword_form
password_reset
register_post
register_form
wp_authenticate
wp_login
login_form

...?

And can you use these to change the words output...?

apply_filters('login_headerurl', 'http://wordpress.org/')
apply_filters('login_headertitle', __('Powered by WordPress'))
apply_filters('login_message', $message)
apply_filters('login_errors', $errors)

I've never used that, but I'm guessing you can change them via a plugin or
what have you.

Thanks so very much :)

This bug hunt is an awesome success and it is not over yet. While
going to sleep last night, I rememberd a lesson learned in similar
contexts. We probably should have been more conservative on what made
it into 2.0.5 .
http://trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=2.0.5

Each of the fixes seem to stand on their own, but quantity of change
increases the risk of fault.

In the future, particularly at this "late" maintenance release and
where we are in 2.1 development cycle, lets consider the first gate to
be "is the issue major?"

This is particularly relevant if you are interested in others such as
Debian distributing WordPress.

I don't want to have a 2.0.6. I want us focus on releasing 2.1.

Thank you,
Lloyd

Message-ID: <CCAEB951-8EE7-4847-B34C-BABDA0A4B4AE@gmail.com>

Hi, this is my first post to the WP Hackers list, though I've used  
WordPress for a long time.  Thanks for an awesome product.

I run FreeMacWare.com and a few sister sites, all powered by  
WordPress.  I've had to make a small change to the source to meet our  
needs, and I wonder if the change ought to be incorporated into the  
WP trunk.  I'm hoping you can help me understand whether or not this  
issue is a bug.

On line 130 of wordpress/trunk/wp-includes/classes.php, you'll find  
this:
	if ( isset($perma_query_vars) && strstr($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], 'wp- 
admin/') )

For our needs I've had to change it to this:
	if ( isset($perma_query_vars) )

To my understanding, $perma_query_vars should be unset no matter  
whether it's a wp-admin/ request or not.  This would seem to make it  
consistent with lines 124 and 127 as well.

Here are the symptoms:
* With a permalink structure of /%postname%/, accessing  
www.example.com/wp-atom.php DOES NOT return any results.
* With any other permalink structure or none at all, accessing  
www.example.com/wp-atom.php DOES return results.

I can give specific details about my case if necessary, but I thought  
I'd open this for discussion first.  (Is that the right way to go  
about this?  Should I provide a patch?)

Best regards,
Richard

Compared to 2.0.3, I think it *is* conservative.  Maybe not in number  
of commits, but definitely in terms of scope.  The vast majority of  
the 2.0.5 changes are trivial tweaks or bug fixes, unlike the huge  
nonce backport into 2.0.3

I'm confident about my commits, but yeah... point taken.

Yes and no.  Most of those changes are very small.

I disagree with this.  At work we have always striven for Maintenance
releases to contain only low risk changes - i.e ones where we can see the
bug and test the solution easily - rather than to keep maintenance
releases small.

In the future with the proposed 120day model we wouldn't need this
maintenace release as we would already have released 2.1 months ago.

Agreed - In general though maintenance releases for WordPress are
triggered by a security issue rather than anything else.

I think we also need to be aware of the fact that in general our end-users
don't always upgrade straight away and we need to understand why:

It is because maintenace releases are difficult to upgrade to - Hopefully
this is simplyfied by Mark, myself and others who provide diff files and
instructions for generating them.

It is because maintenace releases do not fix the issues that are most
important to people - or don't contain enough fixes to be important - or
we do not publish enough easily digestible information about the fixes to
make people keen to upgrade - linking to the trac milestone for a release
in the dev blog post probably doesn't help most of our users.

It is because people are just too lazy - I can see from the small sample
of users who have installed my Verson Check plugin that there are people
out there still running 1.5.2/2.0.1/2.0.2/2.0.3 even with a big flashing
warning  on every admin page!

I love that quip - it makes a lot of sense in a lot of specific  
instances. Unfortunately, it leaves a lot of unspoken, but  
intrinsically associated factors out. The tradeoff on each of those  
three points only makes sense as they relate to *other* unspoken  
attributes of a given project. For example, two major elements are  
"feature requirements"  and  "cost of operations."  With an  
operational cost that approaches zero, you can afford to have the  
price also be zero.  With a zero complexity feature set, you can  
afford to release something of highest quality, and at an arbitrarily  
soon time.

Interesting deduction, especially if we did believe that those three

My intrerpretation of Matt's suggestion is that the 120 goal would be  
more a "hard guideline." I don't think anybody is going to want to  
ship a release just to get it out in time, if it's a piece of crap.

And it might be 110 days. Not all software development has to go over

My reading of this is that when the "fun chaos development time" is  
over, project leaders will hunker down and evaluate which of the fun  
chaos is actually in good enough shape to polish up and ship within  
the next 2 months.  So there's still quite a lot of opportunity to  
wisely choose achievable features.

And with a more frequent release schedule, anybody who was close to  
finishing a feature, but it wasn't quite stable enough, wouldn't feel  
as much pressure to just "sneak it in," because the wait time for the  
next release wouldn't be so far away.  I'm not familiar enough with  
WordPress's code base history, but in general I could see this as a  
stabilizing force for quality.

Thanks for sharing all of your interesting thoughts on the subject. I  
think they are definitely worth considering, even though ultimately I  
think the 120 day schedule will be a great a boon to the project.  
Operating under constraints always seems to help.

I am in need of a Wordpress plugin that adds tagging functionality to posts.
I have found numerous of these plugins via Google, however, before tackling
a fairly steep integration I was hoping that The Hackers could point me in
the right direction.

I will be using this plugin on WPMU and will/can modify if needed.

The plugin has to be efficient, so don't offer up Ultimate Tag Warrior,
because it's ultimately, too inefficient. :)

If anyone has recommendations on a great, flexible, efficient tagging system
for Wordpress/WPMU I would greatly appreciate the feedback.

-Shayne

PS - I do not care as to if it's provider specific as that can be changed.
Ex: Technorati only tags.

Thanks. This seems to work. However, it returns the unformatted content, 
straight out of the database. Now what do I do if I want to format the 
content as HTML in the feed? For instance, turning blank lines into 
paragraph breaks and so forth.

That is, I want to apply the same formatting WordPress does to the raw 
story text before sending it to the browser but in my feed.

That's also in the code:
In "function NST_CheckRSS()"

    $content = apply_filters('the_content', $content);

That will do everything that needs to be done :)

Awesome. This is very important consideration.

Provide diff files: Unfortunately, don't image the impact is that
great as you are getting close to people that likely already have a
handle.

I think your work with Version Check plugin is very important and I
look forward to it or some variant being included in core.

I think it comes done to convenience. I think a nag to inform is an
important small step, but  any thing short of click to upgrade is
probably not going to be the medicine.

Thank you,

The goal is not to keep maintenance releases small, but to keep risk
low. "Low risk" and/or well tested fixes for a a maintenance release
is a second gate.

One of the awesome aspects of the WordPress project currently is that
near trunk is deployed regularly on WordPress.com . This is unique in
my experience and an awesome commitment by Automattic.

Yes I think we would. The maintenance release would be for 2.1
instead, as this release is triggered by a security issue.

You are correct that a regular release cycle reduces the desire of
fixing the niggler bugs in maintenance releases.


Thank you,
Lloyd

I've got another angle on the whole "people aren't upgrading" issue::: Who
Cares? The only thing I can think of that might make upgrading easier is to
run any upgrade.php stuff automatically. That might be dangerous, though, so
I don't think anything is going to change from the technical side. Other
than that - what are you going to do with lazy people that are too lazy to
be bothered to upgrade? You already have a great system that allows people
to use themes/plugins without editing core files - what more could you ask
for?

Also the list is a little bit smaller, as this query doesn?t take tickets
that are still open into account.

The 2.1 release is still some time away so I?m quite happy that some of
these fixes made it into 2.0.5, because I?m actually facing some of those
bugs/issues now on my 2.0.4 blog. So even though they?re not critical, I?m
happy that for instance #3109, #3019 and #2663 (and ofcourse #3142) made
it in. And I?m sure others have similar issues they face fixed by 2.0.5.

As far as I know when a security issue in a Debian package is discovered,
a fix for that particular issue for that particular version is included.
So if Debian starts including 2.0.5 in stable for instance and a security
bug is found, they?ll patch that bug. They won?t "upgrade" to the then to
be released 2.0.6. The 2.0.6 package will still have to follow the normal
path to get included in a future (re-)release of Debian.

I agree, although this service is invaluable to people who want to upgrade
and have made modifications to core on their own. ("hacked" default
templates for instance)

Most non-developers I know have an "install and forget" way of working. If
it works they don?t look into it. Therefore most of them won?t even know
that there even is a newer version out there than what they?re running.

The group that uses your Version Check plugin is most likely already more
savy with computers than most users. And if even they can?t be bothered to
upgrade...

Therefore I?m a big fan of including some of this functionality into core.

I?d even go as far as to have the admin area disable certain functionality
(writing posts for instance) when a security release is released (don?t
bother visitors, only backend users) to "force" people to upgrade. This
functionality should be on by default, but give people a configurable
option to turn it off. Then they have to make a conscious decision not to
upgrade.

Any suggestions on this?

A nag is appropriate, but forcing seems too much.

I have a different but similar idea.
AJAX is "in" now, isn't it?

A "nice" nag would be to grey out the text box for posting, just make it 'disabled' with the text 
"A new version of WP is now available. You can download it at ------ to stop this reminder. 
Click here to continue"

And an option in the WP-admin center to disable this nag....

Maybe?

I like the idea of giving people a notice/warning/heads-up about a new
release, especially one that is done for security purposes. However, if you
put something into the core that sends a ping to the WP Mother Ship stating
what version is running, and then the Mother Ship sends that installation
instructions to inform the user, then people will howl about privacy.

In order to do this in a way that minimizes such claims, you really should
have something in the Install routine that clearly illustrates an opt-in
choice to be notified of updates and what information may be transferred and
how one's privacy is assured.

Given that I am code-clueless, there may be a way to accomplish this without
raising the ire of privacy advocates, in which case you can simply ignore my
comments. :^)

Yeah, it's very simple.
You *don't* send a ping.

You do *all* the checks locally. It's what I do with my programs and scripts, and it works great.
Just have the local WP install grab a text file off the automattic server that contains the latest version (for instance grab version.php from the repo), and *locally* compare the version in that file to the version installed.

That simple. No one ever knows what version _you_ are running, and the only information being exchanged is what version is the latest that exists.

I think that addresses the privacy concerns?

No that doesn't really.

What does is using the privacy option builtin to 2.1 as a way of not  
doing the checks.  This really protects the privacy of the install by  
never contacting the central server - and thereby never sending any  
info about it's existance.

The checks themselves won't need to provide the current version info  
to the central server but instead request the current version from it.

I intend to update the patch for the version update info ticket in  
the next few days to implement this for the core.

Maintain means just security and bug fixes.  Unless MySQL9 manages to
come out, be accepted by Debian, and pushed to testing before Etch
freezes for a December 2006 release, it's not relevant here.

Google's Spider will only find things that are linked to (thus, the name
spider). So, unless you're making a public repository of your database
backups and creating a link to that folder from your website you should
be safe.

I can't speak for how its set up now, but I would imagine it would put
them in some directory outside of your web root or one where the
directory listing is denied to a browser via .htaccess. The latter is
most likely the case.

Howdy !

Standards Group Community. Outside my official work, I'm trying to 
saturate my brain about web knowledges, and to develop slowly the Eight 
O'Clock project - https://sourceforge.net/projects/eightoclock/ - to 
make wordpress a professional tool as stable and useful as Spip for 
example even if wordpress was developed in the mind of blogging.

I'm contacting you to convince you to upgrade to some web standards 
basics. wow. I think I will list some specific subjects later. Anyway, I 
could start with the RSS Feed subject. I think the following article and 
its links explains truly the way of using a unique format for the rss feed:

Also, in what ways do you feel WP does NOT support Web Standards?  
Instead of just leaving a link (trying to drive traffic to your own  
site no doubt), why not leave some details that might be discussed.

It looks like it's not parsing the file on the server. It looks like a lot
of people left the zip or tarball on the server with the config file in it.
It's parsing the archive with the file in it.

Google finds things if you use the Google Toolbar, even if nothing
links to it on the web.  Don't think something can't be found simply
because no one has carved a path to it.

I also provide a "changed files only" zip, that has been very  
popular, especially with people who are not technically inclined.   
People who only have FTP access and have dial-up Internet access also  
like it because it makes the tedious upload process faster.

I'm thinking... spam?

Besides, Kubrick, the default theme, validates as XHTML and CSS last time I
checked. And WordPress generates valid RSS and Atom feeds.

I really don't mean to intice this holy war... but Atom 0.3 has been
considered old and obsolete for some time now...

*But that's not the key point, please note that everything else, RSS2,
XHTML 1.0T, CSS, is all on track, and tentatively valid.*

(Tentatively, because if an author makes a theme that isn't valid,
there's really nothing Wordpress can do about that.)

Yeah, that's why I said that the Kubrick theme (default theme) is valid. We
can't do anything about other, 3rd party themes.

I believe the idea of implementing Atom 1.0 into the core (I'm sure there's
a plugin that would do it) has been floating around for a while. I can't
recall why exactly it was never done.

There's a Trac ticket (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1526) that was done,
but as far as I can tell, it's still waiting for dev feedback.

Hmm - big changesets are bad IMHO.

It makes it very hard to understand what has changed - and to track down
any bugs that may inadvertantly have been introduced later.

Matt could you split your changes out a bit more next time - reading
through the changeset I think you changed the following areas which
could have been individual changesets:

	1. Location of Import and Export menu items and other importer changes.
	2. Styling of the admin pages.
	3. Layout and textual changes on other admin pages.
	3. Removal of the quickjump links to and from the preview view.

This would also lend itself to more descriptive checkin descriptions.

Also a few other comments:

I do like the new styling of the menu now - much better without the links.

Why have we lost the hyperlinks to switch between edit and preview mode?
- - they were very useful.

The Atom syntax is seriously out of date, and most importantly WordPress 
seriously violates the HTTP architecture. Nobody with committer 
privileges seems particularly concerned about either of these, though, 
so I doubt there'll be any movement on them short of a fork.

I agree, that Atom 0.3 is out of date and should be replaced with a full 
implementation of Atom 1.0. But I disagree to remove it.

And could you please explain where and how WordPress violates the HTTP 
architecture?

That is true for bloggers I think, but not for the blogging platform 
(WordPress). Besides, it isn't a web standard to only use one feed.

We've been through this before in the not too distant past. Check the 
archives. The biggest problem is that WordPress uses GET for non-safe 
operations such as deleting POSTs, but there are other issues as well.

Supposedly hidden files can often be exposed by referers in log files on 
someone else's server, There are probably other ways. If you really want 
to hide something, you need to lock it off behind a password.

I'm fairly new to the wp-hackers and I'm not involved with the development of
WordPress, but I'm a bit curious about the right out dismissal of 
someon coming
to the list, with a suggestion that he wants to participate. Why not 
welcome him
and ask for his ideas?
He may be looking for back links, but it's not at all certain.
If he is, it's not very efficient.

IMHO, of course :)

Please go ahead and do just that. WordPress is fairly standards 
compliant as it
stands. Third party additions to WordPress may not be, but for the WP core and
default themes WP is quite good.

<snipped a bit here>
I read the referred article(s) and the comments. I stay unconvinced thogh.
Why is it a bad thing, that I offer more than one feed format?
Feed formats are still under development and test, many clients can cope with
more than one format, and the debate on what is effective goes on.
Religion should have nothing to do with selection of format.

Well, what do you say?

That was just a fragment of something larger (this one was a
whopping  192KB)  with  an enclosure. The 'diff'  is  always
included to reflect on the changes made.

I think that actually about 600 changesets ago, here:

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3769#file5

(I love trac.)

That's kinda old but we can still talk about it if you want.

What I fixed was actually the fact that when you're on an individual 
importer the submenu disappeared, the above brings it back.

> Yes - changes are - http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4349#file2

I was removing the headings entirely as they seemed a bit redundant. I'm 
not crazy about how the preview works currently, but I haven't figured 
out the best way to improve it.

Yellow,

Thanks for your replies. Keep cool, take it easy, and please don't argue 
about what I didn't say. I'm not criticizing Wordpress. To my mind 
Wordpress already supports primary web standards features. And of course 
Wordpress is not responsible if a third party makes a theme that isn't 
valid.

To resume I just wrote to tell you Wordpress could be more standard and 
web standards (I mean a higher level) regards to the code. So I 
motivated myself to contact you and take part in the wordpress politics.

First we should agree about the definition.

I define the Web standards as a way to apply truly and realistly the 
specifications from the W3C. The Web Standards Project (WaSP) fights for 
standards that reduce the cost and complexity of development while 
increasing the accessibility and long-term viability of any site 
published on the Web. (From http://www.webstandards.org/about/) WASP and 
other communities are helping to use those web standards.

I define standard(s) (not standards as the shortcut for web standards) 
languages or technologies that are using the approach to define the 
basics every developer should follow. Following this way, developers 
agree and unify themself to use those resources. There are not 
especially and automatically references to the web world.



===============================================



About the RSS Feed which is not a web standard topic, if you 
think/shure/need multiple formats, considering the current blog platform 
you should still not excess two versions and to use the latest - RSS 2.0 
and ATOM 1.0 - for each feed (Posts and comments). Anyway the ideal for 
users and hardware is to support a unique format for each feed. Here is 
a wiki link to compare RSS 2.0 and ATOM 1.0 :
http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Rss20AndAtom10Compared.

As I am working from my side for the eight oclock project, I thought it 
would be better to talk together about the subjects I'm going to work 
for. To reply to petit with IMOH, using multiple format is just using 
more bandwidth and is giving you many hours to maintain them to the 
right formats. From a general point of view, using a unique format per 
feed :

* Easier to maintain
You can dedicate a specific person from your web development team to 
update the rss technology to the latest stable specifications. This 
person or the group can spend more time to be up to date to his specific 
technology and your platform is not groochy with multiple usual problems 
or bugs, even little, to fix.

* Reduce the amount of bandwidth
Just take your multiple formats and for example calculate the bandwidth 
for a single user who is using a rss reader which default verifies or is 
voluntary configured to verify the new entries every 30 minutes. Use the 
statistics from your host to get an approximative result. Your structure 
and site is growing ? It's time to start slowly optimizing. Rss seems to 
be forgotten. It's worth doing.

* usability : third party can easily access and manipulate your 
informations.
PHP - one of the most popular open source web technology :) - can be 
used in the version 5 with its powerful xml parser which is respectful 
regards to the DOM (a standard). His brother number 4.0 is using the API 
SAX, which is not really the best method as a standard to manipulate xml 
data, but offers possibilities to play with them.
While using a unique format, you are influencing others communities to 
follow the way, to develop tools appropriate to the original needs, and 
to guarantee the easiest access to share informations.

* New interface and marketing strategy
Now you can take time to define new strategies. Instead of giving 
multiple formats links for each feed, you could turn back to a 
completely new offer. Ex: http://www.time.com/time/rss/ (Other examples 
are welcome)



===============================================



The Kubrik design is ok for me. There are various resources on the web 
to get valid xhtml / css templates, and in the web standards state of 
mind. Anyway a better way to promote WS for example could be the use of 
tools from the famous alistapart.com website for the basic template 
xhtml / css.

I suppose xhtml 1.1 is not the best doctype for Wordpress. I would try 
to implement script to serve xhtml 1.0 doctype documents with the right 
mime-type such as 
http://www.htmldog.com/guides/htmladvanced/declarations/. In this case, 
we are working in a "dangerous" environment and an effort of 
arguementing in a polite way should be made before starting any discuss. 
I know this is a hot topic, sometimes even for professionals, and "I 
prefer to warn you and avoid a mailing list panic" ;)

Later I would like to talk about the way of implementing / using 
accessibility with wordpress, default templates and admin panel too.



===============================================


I need to sleep hehe. Regards and good night,

Peter

As a member of WaSP, I agree with your concerns.

Yes, but it's important to be wary of 
standards-for-the-sake-of-standards, or ones that do not provide 
meaningful benefit over current standards-based conventions.

Lots of standards "suck", HTTP has mispelled "referrer" longer than I've 
been on the web, but changing things to make them "more correct" is a 
bad idea. (*cough*frakincommentsRsS*cough)

If something doesn't solve a real-world problem, I'm not particularly 
interested in it.

That document is mostly FUD, very little of it applies to us. I'm not 
sure which of the points there, or the points later in your email, are 
meant to apply to WordPress. RSS 2.0 can be ambiguous in parts, which is 
why we follow conventional RSS:

http://thresholdstate.com/threshold/4166/conventional-rss

If there was an aggregator which could not parse any of the feeds that 
we produce, that would be a good reason to re-examine things, but by 
definition such an aggregator would probably never reach a point of 
success that we would care.

Subject: [wp-hackers] alternative database support
Message-ID: <1160201374.6135.2.camel@sled10-laptop.mdcom-network.com>

I've looked through wp-db.php and it seems supporting an alternate
database (say db2, oracle or even postgresql) wouldn't be too
difficult... has anyone tried porting wp to another database before? Are
there other complications than changing the syntax to match a new
database?

The main complication you will come accros will be mysqlisms in  
queries - either those in the core or those that plugins pump through  
$wpdb.

There have been attempts to port to sqlite (http://trac.wordpress.org/ 
ticket/2317)

The best place to start is to write a extended version of the wpdb  
class which uses the alternative database engine and converts any  
mysqlisms in queries to work with the new database engine.

You code can be loaded in by the pluggable db code in 2.1 (http:// 
trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4154 and http://trac.wordpress.org/ 
changeset/4160)

This is being discussed fairly regularly, e.g.:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005428.html

Maybe it's worth inclusion in some FAQ under wp.org...?  Also, it's bound
to become a serious  problem from  a political  and a technical point  of
view.   I recently discussed  this  elsewhere,  also  in  the context  of
WordPress < http://tinyurl.com/s7kbt >. The sooner people get choice,  
the better, IMHO. Transparency is among one of WP's selling points.

Which is a really nice thought of course. I'd say I'm all for keeping up with
the standards development, wherever it is feasable.

Most WordPress users are one man efforts. The work of changeing a feed 
from the
default, if I think the standards compliancy is faulty, is done by simply
dropping in a new RSS feed PHP script as a replacement.

Of course, the third party may now choose to work with the feed he/she 
wishes to
use.

There is no conspiracy. Make it happen. Check in with the people that
previously volunteered. Co-ordinate the project.

I just don't get people talking about things and not making them
happen. You have to be the change you want to see in this world.

Steps:
1. Write the code
2. Make the code available
3. Have people test the code
4. If the code is ready, find people that find it useful
5. Rince
6. Repeat

I  was going to mention the (hypothetical) possibility of  dedicating an
unstable dev branch for  something like this--one whose  sole purpose is
interoperability (maybe even MAMP and WAMP). If it struggles to progress,
not all is lost.

And if more developers are needed, take the Slashdot (subculture) approach:

1. Get pile of dirty underwear (for rinsing)
2. Send it somewhere up north, along with code
3. Somewhere up north, code makes programmer
4. ???
5. Profit!

Hmmm... In hindsight, it's too dense. Now my brain hurts...

Howdy,

Honestly I'm feeling ridiculous.

I didn't know you were the lead developer of Wordpress, a wasp member 
and webstandards.org was developed with this platform.

So I am a paddawan in front of a master regards to your skills and you 
don't need me (It would be me to need you : ) So I'm going to stop 
"annoying" you about standards topics and wordpress politics you already 
thought about.

I wish you and Wordpress a great future.
Best regards,

Peter

I put my hand up to add Oracle support when this discussion came up in March.
While I no longer need an Oracle port for work ('cause I'm resigning
tomorrow...*choke*), I am still keen to contribute; especially if the
goal is to use ADODB(.sourceforge.net) to add alternative DB support.
Between ADODB's automagic conversion of many MySQLisms to other syntax
and it's availability as a C extension, I still think it's the way to
go.

I didn't start on porting wpdb back in March because I wanted to wait
for the 2.1 branch to stabalize. Well, here we are. Who else is in?

More options does not make something better. With rare exceptions, the 
cost of the options often outweighs their benefits.

WordPress doesn't do anything that fancy with the database. There is 
feature-comparable software driven purely by text files.

I used to be fairly enamored with the idea of DB-independence, but then 
as I tried it I found the entire concept to be a farce. I have the same 
level of interest of making Oracle, Postgres, DB2, a part of core WP as 
I do having the program also run in Perl, Python, ASP, Ruby, and Erlang.

It's theoretically possible, and even attractive if you imagine *how 
much larger* our userbase could be if we simply supported every 
conceivable server configuration, but at some point the costs add up:

1) Infinitely more complex testing (we have enough trouble with W/LAMP)
2) Same for debugging
3) Non-trivial overhead in code
4) Much slower development (WP Vista in 2008!)
5) No visible benefits to regular users

I will be the first to admit that it is entirely luck that WP happens to 
be attached to the most popular and fastest growing database in history, 
and written in the most successful server-side scripting language, but 
let's not throw away so lightly the benefits to development the 
luckiness in our platform choices provided.

Lastly, as someone pointed out, $wpdb is structured as such that all the 
hard work could be done as a $wpdb replacement with some clever regex, 
with no core modifications. (Aka, a plugin.)

The relatively mature WP ecosystem has generally shown that development 
closely follows market demand, where WP has lagged behind people's needs 
(image handling, tags) dozens of plugins have sprung up to fill the void.

All that said, the one other DB I would see as interesting in the 
context of WP would be sqlite, simply because it is so small and light 
and simple that it could potentially be run in places where any normal 
DB system would be prohibitive, like a Linksys router. Also its bundling 
with OS X and a future version of Firefox (maybe?) opens up even more 
possibilities for the use of WP as a standalone desktop app for personal 
use and/or development. How small a desktop download could we squeeze a 
self-contained light web server + PHP + WP-sqlite into? I have no idea 
if that would actually work, but at least it'd be something compelling 
and different than anything easily available today. However now I'm 
daydreaming and we should probably start another thread if we're going 
to discuss that.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP cron and "multi-threading"
Message-ID: <45290427.9020709@midnightcircus.com>

I've used wp_schedule_event() to register a cron event during the 
activation of my plugin, and I have a couple of issues.

#1: The cron event seems to leave remnants of non-existent args in the 
serialized options array.  Every time it runs it adds an array wrapper 
to the existing zero-length array of arguments.  I don't know if this 
patch (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3169) will fix it.  I'm not sure 
if it's causing any issues with the plugin itself since I'm not using 
the parameters, but I don't think it will be a problem, at least until 
the size of the data exceeds the field length.

#2: I need the cron to run *exactly once* at each interval.  Assuming 
that traffic on the site is buzzing along, the current cron 
implementation could allow events to be processed more than once, 
depending on how long it takes for the hooked function to run.  In my 
case, the computation in the cron hook usually takes 2 seconds or more, 
leaving plenty of room for another incoming hit to trigger the same event.

I've implemented a flock() check in my own code, something I'd rather 
not do.  It might be beneficial to rearrange the cron code so that it 
unschedules the event before it executes it.

Any other clever suggestions as to how to keep the cron from executing 
more than once on a single registered instance would be helpful.

Is anybody else using this functionality in their plugins?

Your side in this debate makes perfect sense (in isolation), but  
please allow me to play devil's advocate. I know for a fact that I am  
not alone in this stance. This debate is also related to hidden  
options and preloading of functionality (with or without plugins).  
I'll present some counter arguments.

Very true, but these scale badly.

P/L's and DB's are very different. There are common interfaces for  
databases (e.g. SQL) whereas P/L's are more 'fluid'. There are also  
ambiguities that make transition/conversion a non-deterministic  
process. So while the comparison is convenient, research contradicts  
it. Languages are unified by their FSA's, but finding correspondence  
at a higher level is infeasible. Moreover, there are different  
paradigms and, contrariwise, while some databases are object-oriented,  
they preserve the same interfaces.

If you use the strategy pattern, then not only will you attain good  
modularity, but you will also make testing more 'distributable'.

True.

If done tactfully, the effect of this can be mitigated.

True. But if you can expand/divide a team to work in a non-interfering  
fashion, then you never deal with 'code spaghetti'. Vista (formerly  
Longhorn), on the other hand, was scraped in October 2005 because the  
code was not modular. It still requires 60% of its entirety to be  
rewritten.


> 5) No visible benefits to regular users


"Regular" raises a brow. A more open set of options could appeal to  
more people who seek to integrate WP with something else. And there is  
also something to be said about security and monoculture. WP has had  
security breaches in the past.

Okay, but here you seem to justify what earlier you described as a  
repellent route. This could develop to become akin to GNUzilla or  
IceWeasel, or forks like Flock or Swiftfox. I am aware of similar  
projects such as LightPress that emerged to address other types of  
demand. Maybe it's something worth thinking about... *smile*

What do you need exactly?  "tagging" means way to many things.  For
instance I wrote a tagging plugin for my site that is very simple and
flexible.  Of course that is my idea of flexible and simple.

Give us a more detailed idea of what you need.

You should definitely keep contributing when and where you can.

Although newbies like us (of course) won't have as much WordPress-domain knowledge as those who've worked on it forever, it's safe to say that there are plenty of opportunities to make WordPress better.

In fact, "beginners minds" will often have interesting ideas for solving problems that the "old guard" may no longer even consider to be problems.

I have nothing clever to offer. Even unscheduling beforehand leaves a 
window of contention, although the window is narrowed.

I've run into this before in testing and I've thought a lot about the
best way to handle the race condition. The best I can think of, and I
think it may work, is in wp-cron.php, we set an option that says "we
are busy doing the cron" along with some random hash. Then we sleep
for 500 usecs, and check the value of the option. If the option has
the same value, we continue. If the option has a different value,
there was some race condition, and the other thread run, and we die.
Psuedo-code:

if(get_option('cron_is_running'))
    die(); // Something else definitely beat us to it.
$localhash = generate_some_random_hashval(); // Possibly based on
microtime, as there is no way with current computing power that we'd
generate a hash twice in the same usec.
update_option('cron_is_running', 'something with the hashval to tell
us its true');
usleep(250000); // Sleep for 1/4th of a second
if(get_option('cron_is_running') && $hash_from_that_option != $localhash)
     die(); // Something else had a race condition with us and won, we die();

Message-ID: <71ddd7490610081411y5a2a210cq1d56262ef40aba11@mail.gmail.com>

So Matt's earlier contributions to the "Alt DB" thread got me to
thinking - I think there's quite a bit of merit to supporting SQLite,
EVEN in situations where the background DB is MySQL.

Here's how I see it:

SQLite allows for "real" relational DB features in what is essentially
a file-based format.  For smaller sites, the performance gains
realized by hosting the DB on the same server as the WP install itself
could be considerable (much of the slowdown for my site on Dreamhost
seems to originate in slow-to-the-DB-server performance, for
instance).  SQLite _also_ allows for essentially on-the-fly backups
simply by saving the DB files themselves - no mysqldump, no
phpMyAdmin, no WP-to-XML export necessary.   If we could architect a
"write/read the entire contents of WP to/from SQLite" solution, we
could essentially work around all of the backup folderol we've seen
recently.  This would also allow for all plugin-created data to be
backed up easily.

Downsides: ALL plugins would have to use some sort of DB abstraction
layer in order to take advantage of said features, and we have enough
problems getting people to use $wpdb already (how many raw SQL queries
have you seen in plugins recently?).  SQLite isn't a given in all
hosting environments, although most people with command-line access to
their setup could potentially utilize a self-installed version.

I definitely think SQLite support (as opposed to ADOdb, Oracle,
Postgres, DB2, etc.) is worth looking into, if not actively pursuing.

ADOdb supports SQLite, if you used it as the db layer for your SQLite  
port it is likely folks could use your work to get closer to  
supporting PostgreSQL and others. I think it would cost very little  
to go this route, and would obviously have great potential benefit.

I've been pleasantly surprised with how easy it is to support MySQL,  
PostgreSQL and MS SQL Server using ADOdb.

Cheers,

I've used ADOdb a bit too and it's almost transparent, at least what I did
with it.

I think some MySQL-specific queries might fail, I'm not sure how ADOdb
handles them (if it converts them at all)...

Okay, given what has been discussed in re: ADOdb support, what
possible downsides are there to making WP rely upon ADO, with the
obvious exceptions of 1) reliance upon yet another outside package and
2) potential performance concerns?

Not potential. Definite.

Size is another concern. Adodb would almost double the size of WP.
Rewriting every query to work with Adodb, which means rewriting the
whole method for which we handle dates, which is MySQL DATETIME
reliant.

Other possible concerns are upgrade path if this was to (for some
unknown reason) ever make it into the core. Personally, I am -1 for
adodb.

There might still be other problems: does `dbDelta()` need to be fully
pluggable?

The dynamic query replacement could be better. If WordPress made use
of prepared statements, for example, frequently-used queries could be
substituted with a single lookup in a hash table.

I mean, something like this (PDO style):

    $stmt = $wpdb->prepare("SELECT post_status, comment_status
                            FROM :post_table WHERE ID = :comment_post_ID");

    $stmt->bindParam(':comment_post_ID', $comment_post_ID);
    $stmt->bindParam(':post_table', $wpdb->posts);

    $status = $stmt->execute();

The query sent to `prepare()` could be a key in a MySQL->SomeOtherSQL
map array -- much faster. That's on top of the other benefits of
prepared statements, obviously, like automatic escaping and repeated
queries.

I was talking with Michael Hampton (io_error) about this for  
something he was doing, and that was the solution I gave him as well,  
with slightly different details.

You need to expire the "cron_is_running" option, in case your winning  
race candidate dies before it gets to unset it.  You could set a  
separate timestamp option "cron_start_time" and have WP autoload and  
check that, deleting both options if 15 minutes or so have passed  
(it's just for emergencies).

I'm not really privy to the details of how the cron works, you can  
decide if this makes sense:

you need to mark the cron as having been run BEFORE the wait time  
begins, to avoid another race, or do another wait after marking the  
cron as run but before erasing "cron_is_running"

I've written up the p-code as part of the plugin.  The idea seems sound, 
and has been working so far.  I'm going to leave it running for a while 
to make sure.

Grr.  Ok.  Logging success/failure of all of this would be useful, too. 
  Ah, if only you could count on the presence of try-catch exception 
handling.  Alas, PHP4.

So has someone implemented all this already, or what?  I don't want to 
waste days testing cron anomalies if someone's already got the code 
written.  Pony up.

No, if it loses the race condition, something else has overwritten it.
The other thread that won the race condition will clean it up when its
finished.

I don't have it, but I will write it after school today if someone

I worry that this might feed some script kiddies, but it's very  
important to explicitly tell people _NOT_ to share their files too  
openly.

I think what is being discussed here is a drop-in replacement for  
$wpdb (as described by Matt) that would use ADOdb and could support  
PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL Server, etc. - I don't think anyone is  
talking about putting any of this in core right now.

For anyone who wants to support an additional DB for whatever reason,  
I think working together on an ADOdb port makes a ton of sense.

Cheers,

It'll clean up *IF* it finishes.  What if one of the cron'd actions  
causes a fatal error?  Then you're stuck with "cron_is_running" set  
to a key that'll never be matched again.

Pretend that Tom Hanks is a process.  He claims Helen Hunt by  
marrying her.  Then, his FedEx plane crashes and he's stranded on a  
tropical island with only an inflatable ball as a companion.  Helen  
Hunt is stuck, because she can't confirm that Hanks has died or  
otherwise *explicitly* relinquished his claim on her as his spouse.   
Should she wait forever?  Nah.  She waits a few years and Hanks is  
declared legally dead, and she remarries.

Sort of like that. :-)

You forgot to remove it from the Page editor:

Agreed that the current preview isn't great.

Here's an idea.  How about we add another tab above the Post  
textarea: "Preview"

On clicking the tab, we could save the entry asynchronously, and then  
swap in an iframe (it'd need more height, but that's okay) with a  
preview of the entry.

That'd also fix the issue of the preview loading every time you edit  
an entry, which slows you down a bit.

Since you mentioned upgrades, I guess plugins could be an issue
as well.   It would be nice  if an  abstraction  layer has been
there since day 1.

Since you mentioned upgrades, I guess plugins could be an issue
as well.   It would be nice  if an  abstraction  layer had been
there since day 1.

Now that, right there, is funny.

As long as you don't try to get all "current entertainment events" on
us and claim the process is some dude named "Desmond" on a race around
the world who mysteriously disappears in a magnetic anomaly who spends
several years typing out a series of lottery numbers on an ancient
green screen, overseen by a former CIA agent whom Desmond pursues and
finds is secretly reconstructing his boat in order to escape from the
island and accidentally kills and then triggers a second anomaly which
causes a planeload of very attractive people to break up over the
island and...

Okay, I'll stop now.

I've no particular loyalty to ADOdb, as you can see by the thread

     Advisory: PHP unserialize() Array Creation Integer Overflow
Release Date: 2006/10/09
Last Modified: 2006/10/09
       Author: Stefan Esser [sesser@hardened-php.net]

  Application: PHP 5 <= 5.1.6, PHP 4 < 4.3.0
Not affected: PHP 4 >= 4.3.0,
               PHP with Hardening-Patch,
               PHP with Suhosin-Patch
     Severity: User-input passed to the unserialize() function might
               trigger an integer overflow in array creation that
               might result in remote code execution
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Fixed in CVS, no security update planned, wait for PHP 5.2.0
   References: http://www.hardened-php.net/advisory_092006.133.html


Overview:

   Quote from http://www.php.net
   "PHP  is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that
    is especially suited for Web development and can be embedded
    into HTML."

   The PHP 5 branch of the PHP source code lacks the protection
   against possible integer overflows inside ecalloc() that is
   present in the PHP 4 branch and also for several years part of
   our Hardening-Patch and our new Suhosin-Patch.

   It was discovered that such an integer overflow can be triggered
   when user input is passed to the unserialize() function. Earlier
   vulnerabilities in PHP's unserialize() that were also discovered
   by one of our audits in December 2004 are unrelated to the newly
   discovered flaw, but they have shown, that the unserialize()
   function is exposed to user-input in many popular PHP applications.
   Examples for applications that use the content of COOKIE variables
   with unserialize() are phpBB and Serendipity.

   The successful exploitation of this integer overflow will result
   in arbitrary code execution.


Details:

   Several years ago when integer overflows inside the calloc()
   function-family became popular in the security industry, many
   function libraries that contained similar allocation functions
   were hardened against the possible multiplication overflow.

   The ecalloc() function used in the Zend Engine 1 was one of the
   functions that were hardened against this kind of attack.
   Unfortunately the PHP developers never bothered merging this
   protection into the code of the Zend Engine 2, which powers PHP 5.

   However when Hardened-PHP was created by us in 2004 a similar
   protection of ecalloc() was added to our patch. Therefore our
   users are safe from the problem described here.

   unserialize() is a PHP function that allows deserialisation of
   previously serialised PHP variables. Many applications use it
   to store PHP variables in an easy accessible data format. Some
   of them even put serialised strings into COOKIEs and later
   unserialize() them again.

   Unfortunately passing user-input to unserialize() is a bad idea
   because it also supports the deserialisation of objects, which
   might influence the application. Additionally it is trivial to
   crash PHP with a large amount of nested arrays.

   Furthermore we discovered that storing a large value for the
   number of array elements into the serialised string will trigger
   an integer overflow inside ecalloc(), resulting in the allocation
   of 0 bytes (plus the Zend Memory Manager management headers).
   When this happens unserialize() will continue working with a
   to small bucket array. When the string is parsed for the array
   elements the HashTable functions will operate on memory not
   allocated for this purpose. This can lead to several different
   memory corruption attacks.

   A carefully crafted string can use this to execute arbitrary code.
   In our proof of concept exploit this is achieved by storing a
   HashTable with our own destructor into the PHP array. When the
   PHP variable is destroyed this will result in the execution of
   our shellcode.

   Note: In general this kind of attack on HashTable destructors
   is impossible when Hardening-Patch or Suhosin-Patch are installed
   because both detect modification of HashTable destructors.

   Note: In general we dislike to release advisories while there are
   no official fixed versions available, but the fact that Linux
   distributions already are shipping patched versions and that the
   PHP CVS contains an explicit commit message we believe it is
   important all parties about unserialize(). It is not really a
   problem to find out with a few grep commands that unserialize()
   is allowing dangerous ecalloc() calls.


Proof of Concept:

   The Hardened-PHP Project will release a proof of concept exploit
   for this vulnerability after the release of PHP 5.2.0 has happened
   and a few weeks have passed.


Disclosure Timeline:

   30. September 2006 - Notified security@php.net, vendor-sec
   30. September 2006 - Patch was committed to PHP CVS
   05. October 2006   - Redhat, Mandriva release PHP updates
   06. October 2006   - PHP security updates in media
   09. October 2006   - Public Disclosure


Recommendation:

   It is strongly recommended to patch your version of PHP with the
   following patch until php.net is providing updates.

   http://www.hardened-php.net/files/CVE-2006-4812.patch

   As usual we very strongly recommend to install our Suhosin-Patch
   and the Suhosin Extension. Once again it was proved, that our
   patch protects users of PHP against unknown flaws within PHP.
   Users of our patch have been protected against this flaw for about
   2 years now.

   Our Suhosin extension on the other hand supports transparent
   cookie encryption. When TCE is activated, which is the default
   setting, and the encryption key is set it is not possible for
   an external attacker to exploit the unserialize() flaws in our
   examples: phpBB and Serendipity.

Since WP relies on a minimum of 4.1.2 (I seem to recall this was the
version) then I'm not bringing it up as a "what do we do about PHP" area of
concern. We won't be relying on 5.2 for a long time, methinks.

However, maybe looking at why we serialize arrays and if there's another way
to skin the cat that circumvents the issue altogether.

I don't know how critical this really is. The bugtraq reporter calls it that
but I don't know that it's easily exploited, etc. Maybe a non-issue, but I
figured bringing it to the attention of the list might generate some
conversation on it.

It was raised in response to another `unserialize()` issue, also
mentioned in that advisory, that it's "trivial to crash PHP with a
large amount of nested arrays".

Text compresses. The more text you have, the more you can compress it. 
Where does spam come into the picture? Is this assuming that spam is the
only comment long enough to be compressed?

Or am I forgetting something?

How about this.

Kind of like the approach I take in my sk2-digest-plugin to stop getting
multiple digest emails with concurrent spam attempts.

1. Cron event is detected to be run
2. Reschedule event for now+10mins
3. Run event
4. Unschedule the now+10mins event

i.e some way of marking an event as in progress but ensuring that if
something die()'s we give the event another chance.

That's Paul Mitchell's site. He posts here all the time.  I'm sure you'll
get a quick answer.  I can't even get the download from the plugin site to
work...

I think we'll find out it is the manner in which the "compression" is done.
If you eliminate all links and lines with a single word and eliminate the
words "poker", "casino", "blackjack" and
"worthless-wastes-of-bandwidth-and-oxygen" and you might find spam messages
compress to a rather high ratio. Yes, that compression is lossy, but what's
it matter if you aren't keeping it...

Good question though and I'm curious to the answer.

Just a guess, but I suppose it's based on the spams that contain looong
lists of links, all with a common domain. Which would compress really well.

But I don't think I'd want to rely on this as a spam detection method.
There's too much of a chance of false-positives if this thing is as
simple as he seems to be indicating. He's saying that a 5-1 compression
ratio indicates spam. I've seen non-spam texts that compress at ratios
10-1 or better.

Not the more text you have, but the more text that is similar, I guess.
"spam spam spam" will compress more than "abcdefghijklmn" despite being the
same amount of letters.

I understand this.. I just don't see how it relates to Spam but not (or at
least more than) normal text...
That's really it.. Just curious on how this works, because it's an
interesting concept where all of a sudden we're focusing on the _way_
spammers type more than what they write - the latter being what most other
spam filters check for.

Combine both together and you get something close to infallible... but they
both have to be great in the first place.

Guess we just wait for Paul?

Agreed.

I can't see why WP wouldn't support multiple DB platforms - most of the 
DB calls seem very basic and there's nothing really binding to MySQL.

A few seem to be asking the obvious question: why bother? The problem is 
it's missing a large part of the market (corp types) where DB platforms 
may not be so open to options and then weird things happen - like the 
"short list" is based on all the blogging apps that do run on your 
current infrastructure. At my company for instance, WordPress would not 
be possible or an option simply b/c of the database - which is dumb, 
yes, but fact of life.

Message-ID: <a491f91d0610100424i29c2ac0ag2ae99f926c4a0a68@mail.gmail.com>

Here's a summary of all the reasons why I think this is a bad idea.

1. Its a lot more work than I think a lot of people are willing to
admit. For something like ADODB, all the queries will have to be
rewritten, and the structure of the posts table will have to be
changed since the way we store dates is reliant on a MySQL specific
extension to the ANSI specifications.

2. Speed and scalability. I'll leave the fact that ADODB has overhead
out of this. Rather than that, think of how we're supposed to optimize
our database schema for different database servers. We don't have the
opportunity to create indexes that may be blazingly fast on MySQL and
do nothing on another database system, and vice versa. The speed of
the database has long been a complaining point on WP for many, and I
doubt that without the ability to fine-tune indexes to their best
performance point on each individual system, we're going to see any
gain, and more likely a loss.

3. Plugins. A large portion of the reason WP is so popular is its
plugin architecture. If a seperate ADODB version is created and
released, this now means plugin authors have to choose, as queries
will not just drop in and work. This means that popular plugins
already out for WordPress would have to be adapted, or the users of
the other version would have to go without them. Any new plugins for
the new version wouldn't work with the current one, and once again we
have a dilema with a portion of the audience being left out.

4. Controlling the environment. I personally think that with a
software that is supposed to work on the widest range of servers
possible without being a burden, we've already hit that burden. The
amount of issues we field with IIS vs Apache vs Some other httpd is
large enough, we're still fixing IIS redirect problems to go into
2.0.5. To keep WordPress as sucessful as it is, I think we need to
still control the environment that we operate in as much as possible
without sacrificing current users. This means not giving up our
preference for database servers, our choice for programming language,
etc.

5. Support. I don't think the support staff would appreciate having to
field the new questions about things they've never heard of. We'll
have the support asking us support questions on what all these
database systems are.

It's all up now...

And his intro says it all
"I have a theory that what makes a spam message is repetitiveness. My plugin
calculates how repetitive a message is and marks it as 'spam' if the
repetitiveness is too high. It cannot and will not catch all spam, but it
covers those messages that contain long lists of links."

And this uses a standard GZCompress.  I suspect that this will only catch a
certain kind of spam and will have to be tuned to each person's blog
messages. For instance, Pop Song lyrics in a comment would be kicked out
immediately.

Yeah, reading his intro pretty much confirms yesterdays discussion..

I just think this is a very good idea, and it strikes me that it has serious
potential... Not the repetitiveness itself, but the analyzing of word
patterns in spam.
I mean, tie up a grammer-checker and a flesh-kincaid meter to a compression
test, wouldn't that work?

Don't focus on what's being said, rather focus on how it's being said?

Message-ID: <71ddd7490610100656w3df8b3f9ge2859da7b9bce64e@mail.gmail.com>

I've noticed that WP coders, developers and plugin devs seem to have a
real thing for Prototype and its derivatives (Script.aculo.us, moo.fx,
etc.) and have largely given the Yahoo! UI and JS libraries a pass.
First question is: why?  Does the Proto codebase fit more easily into
people's coding worldview?  Do the methods and functions provided by
Proto lend themselves to easier deployment?  Or is it simply a matter
of popularity leading to further popularity?

Second question is: have you seen Jack Slocum's use of the Y!UI in a
TOTAL revamp of his WordPress blog's commenting system?
http://www.jackslocum.com/yui/2006/10/09/my-wordpress-comments-system-built-with-yahoo-ui-and-yahooext/
 ?  Hooo-leeee crap.  It's still kind of raw, but it adds a whole
dimension to blog comments that I've never seen before.  It gives
comments the ability to be true annotations, spatially associated with
the portions of a post to which the comments actualy apply.  It's
almost wiki-like - I could see it being extremely popular in
group/corporate blog situations.

So, that being said: who wants to help convince Jack to release his
work as a plugin? *grin*

Sorry to keep bringing this up, but it's obviously unclear from the  
resulting e-mails in the thread:

Is this discussion about:

1.) the best way for people who are *already* going to port WP to  
another db to work together on a fork of some kind by building a  
$wpdb replacement and seeing whatever else they need to do[*]?

2.) changing WP to officially support ADOdb?

I was sure it was #1, yet folks keep popping up to explain why #2 is  
a bad idea so maybe I have it wrong.

[*] Changing the string escaping and dates in all queries will be  
required for ADOdb.

I thought it was #1 - it makes sense to find at least some semblance of 
continuity if a port is made though to push some of the code changes 
back into the mainline if possible which is where I think everyone is 
jumping to #2...

Anyone who's done extensive performance testing of MySQL can vouch that 
it is one of the worst performing and least scalable database options 
for demanding workloads - now a blog... it doesn't really matter b/c 
these are fairly lightweight workloads. But if the index is so tapped 
for performance... maybe there are other options.

Now I like MySQL b/c 1) it's free (at least until you try to 
distribute...) and 2) it's everywhere and well supported by the 
community. I don't want to get into a perf/scalability argument but 
there's nothing to say that just introducing other database platforms 
will hurt performance. It's how you introduce other database platforms 
that could affect performance.

This issue is just a result of the architecture as it's been; not 
necessary how it has to be going forward. Besides if someone is going to 
port on their own, they'll probably just do the same with the plugins 
they rely on.

I completely agree but there has to be a way to manage this through 
testing/etc. And if it's just someone doing a port for their own use - 
it won't affect your support anyway.

Other application vendors seem to find ways of supporting just about any 
database on the market. If the right design is built in, it's easy. 
Maybe this is something for v3.0....

(snip)

I worked with the Yahoo UI libraries for about three weeks, designing a
wordpress theme and some other pages. 

My personal stopping point came when I was trying to make it 'look
right' on IE and on FF displays. I don't care if they look the same or
not, but some of the IE problems I had were just ugly. I went from
there to trying to validate the HTML and CSS with the W3 consortium
parsers. At the end of the day, I was spending as much time on it as if
I had tried to build it myself, and so the overhead of the libraries
seemed to be overkill.

Prototype, etc, I have an easier time implementing and having it look
non-ugly.

YUI is one of the best Ajax/JavaScript frameworks, not only from a
technology standpoint but from a documentation and user community standpoint
as well.

I use YUI's "CSS Reset" and "CSS Fonts" tools
<http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/> to normalize the visual experience across
different browsers and browser versions.  (You can use these with Prototype,
too.)  Without these, I would go insane.

Remember kids:  Just because MySQL offers enough performance to satisfy Yahoo! doesn't mean that it offers enough performance for your blog.   :^P

Seriously, my fianc?e regularly consults with Fortune 100 companies, and often speeds up database operations 100X-1,000X just by fixing stupid code.  Typically, the problem is the loose nut above the keyboard rather than the database itself.

I'm not the biggest yahoo! Fan, but to be brutally honest, Yahoo! Has the
very best dev-friendly outlook for small-to-medium developers.

Google is just getting started and so far their kits suck. Microsoft is all
about big projects (I could never implement their Atlas AJAX library on a
blog or simple theme), and Yahoo! Is just great.....

That whole e-mail was an idea of why either one is a bad idea. The
principles apply to both, if someone is going to try to release it for
all without completely renaming it and distinguishing it in every way
possible, then everything in that e-mail aplies..

Forking is part of Open Source - if the core product is (for whatever  
reason) not willing to satisfy needs/requests that people have, they  
can choose to do so themselves. You may not like this and/or disagree  
with what they are talking about doing - that is your right.

All I'm saying is that if the folks that want PostgreSQL/SQLite/etc.  
all work together on an ADOdb port, this work can benefit and be  
leverages by others. I think that having a single fork around  
additional database support is a lot better idea than a fork for each  
database type.

Surely the best thing is to try and work with the support that is there.

Try and write a port to another db that uses the ability in 2.1 to
replace wpdb with a different version without changing and WordPress code.

Write the new wpdb such that it translates the queries and deals with
the mysqlisms.

If this can't be done without any changes to the core code them submit
them as small simple well reasoned patches to trac - if they improve
WordPress and help the ability to integrate in on other dbs then they
will likely get into the core code.

By doing it this way and creating a "plugin" to get the alternative db
support in you can concentrate on one thing - db independance rather
than ending up with a db independant old version which doesn't lend
itself to merging back in.

Agreed about the tracks/forks.  

Also, perhaps the adoption of the WP API (so to speak) to access the DB
rather than straight SQL commands has to be more universal before this can
take off at full speed.  Heck, people still insert posts using queries
rather than core code.  We just saw that question here this month and I'm
sure there are other examples in the field.  When the core can do everything
needed and the current plugins authors and hackers can teach
those-who-come-after to only use core calls to access the DB, you'll be able
to make the DB access a modular black box that can be replaced at will.

The team that eventually does this might have a good start if they looked at
where SQL is used in all of the plugins and determining if there are methods
to handle that in the core and if not, adding it if it is needed.  By
completely modularizing the DB access this way, their job might be a lot
easier in the end.

Textpattern does something like this. It has the plaintext textarea, then
another tab for just the HTML, and a preview tab.

Could do something similar -- Rich Text tab, Raw HTML tab and Preview tab
which is just an iframe.

Why don't we move the SQL calls to a translation style dictionary lookup,
and wpdb is already quite modular, then if someone wants to write a
different DB layer, they can, it just won't be supported by the default, no
skin off our noses, but we have added a great deal of flexibility to the
database side of proceedings.

Subject: [wp-hackers] svn: language_attributes() undefined for 5 minute
	install
Message-ID: <452DA3BC.3030906@verselogic.net>

In working on my wpopenid plugin, I was testing against wordpress' subversion trunk head, so 
I exported a fresh copy and tried to run the 5-minute installer. It didn't work.

On /wordpress/index.php, instead of the link to /wordpress/wp-admin/setup-config.php:
PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function language_attributes() in 
/Users/alan/Sites/wp21/wp-includes/functions.php on line 1112

The link uses wp_die() for a pretty message.
As of [4259], wp_die() uses language_attributes() in the <html> tag.
language_attributes() is in includes/general-template.php
general-template.php is require_once()'d by wp-settings.php
wp-settings.php is require_once()'d by wp-config.php

If wp-config.php does not exist, language_attributes() is not available in wp_die(), so a 
PHP Fatal error is displayed instead of the useful error message / link. Depending on PHP 
config, the user is left with a blank screen, or the error above.

I believe my logic above to be sound, but would welcome commentary. I opened a ticket on 
trac: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3231

I'm not seeing it. Do you just mean the "department" tagline? If so,
you can create that effect just by editing your template files.

Message-ID: <baa7f7d60610121426h63419abk794372cee7e9c1f2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.
I am wondering why the Patch which is attached on
#1008<http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1008>isn't merged to the
public. Is there any reason for that?
When i am searching for the bug in my application i read the api-doc of the
MetaWeblog-API: http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi#metaweblognewmediaobject
and there the following written: "bits is a base64-encoded binary value
containing the content of the object.", so i think the patch is doing the
absolute right thing:
decode the base64-encoded string.
There is a second ticket #679 <http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/679> which
is closed with WORKSFORME.

It would be nice, if someone could tell me the reason, so i can understand.

Thank you

It would not be hard to punch in to the theme manually.  It would be a good
way to wet your toes, if you're new to php.
VIA WP put the path to the image in your category description field.  Then
just modify your theme to include that image (if any) in your post header.

Should be a fun quick change...

Or perhaps print a category-based class for the post div (some
themes--like Sandbox--already do this) and assign in the CSS the image
as a background for that class.

I think quite a few changes have been made in 2.1 towards the goal of
making the template tag functions contain as little hard coded html as
possible.

Does the new wp_lists_bookmarks [1] functionality in 2.1 satify your needs?

Hello

I hope not rise a flame war on this, but I have been on a blog with
quite a long list of comments. Its linear display made is somehow
difficult to follow who answered whom.

The question is: could wordpress provide a display which would be more
similar to a newsreader, in which every thread gets a subject and a
indentation or something similar.

Thanks

This wouldn't be a bad idea with the capabilities of Actionscript.
Integrating it with TinyMCE is also easily done through
Actionscript/Javascript integration. The only big problem I see right now is
that the file uploader class in Flash is a feature only found in Flash 8.
Adobe currently only has Flash Player version 7 available for Linux. They
are talking about releasing a Version 9 for Linux, but who really knows
if/when that will happen (there was talk for a long time about a version 8
for Linux but apparently Adobe scrapped that idea). This means, for the time
being at least, that the uploader won't work on Linux/Solaris systems, so it
would be best if we offered both methods that can either be selected via the
options panel or through a Javascript flash version check (or a combination
of the 2).

Agreed.  You'll make this Linux user very angry ("Hulk angry!  Hulk
smash!") if you force me to use Flash to upload schtuff.

Hi Uwe,

This has been discussed in the list several times in the past (search  
for threaded or nested comments in the wp-hackers archives). At  
present, this functionality  can be  integrated using a  plugin (I  
suspect that several
exist).

Best wishes,

Roy

Might it be a good idea to make the bookmark links (wp_links) "hook-able"?

This will give plug-in developers the possibility to modify the links. For 
example the wp_ozh_click_counter and dofollow plugin may benefit from it.

It is a very small and simple hack:

For WP 2.0.4:
- Open wp-includes/links.php
- Search for "function get_links("
- Continue seach for "} // end while"
- After it add this: $output = apply_filters('wp_links', $output);

Surely both searches without the quotes.

I'm just asking this here. Not giving you a patch.

Cheers,
Roland

Message-ID: <baa7f7d60610131236p35916891ic1c000413d4d29de@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.
I am wondering why the Patch which is attached on
#1008<http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1008>isn't merged to the
public. Is there any reason for that?
When i am searching for the bug in my application i read the api-doc of the
MetaWeblog-API: http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi#metaweblognewmediaobject
and there the following written: "bits is a base64-encoded binary value
containing the content of the object.", so i think the patch is doing the
absolute right thing:
decode the base64-encoded string.
There is a second ticket #679 <http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/679> which
is closed with WORKSFORME.

It would be nice, if someone could tell me the reason, so i can understand.

Thank you

I would expect the main reason why this patch has lingered is the
majority of the developers who hang around trac and this list don't use
xml-rpc to post and don't have the easy ability to test the patch and
check that is it doing the correct thing.

Can you suggest a free client that we can use to test the patch that
uses this API? Or even better a number of clients we can test?

Could take BubbleShare's approach... have the fancy Flash-based one set up
by default, then have an option both on the write page and in the options to
change it to a HTML-based uploader.

Wow, it's a surprise to me that most people here don't use external editors.

Doesn't "everything" use this API?  Just from memory, Windows Live Writer,
Performancing, RocketPost, NetNewsWire, Qumana, MarsEdit, and Ecto.

I have sent a private message regarding a suggested tool. 

One major problem is the way clients can sometimes work around or ignore
bugs in xml-rpc. It is easier for the client author to do this than get a
change made globally in a single platform.

Plugins can also cause xml-rpc errors

Well I can't see any reason why we would, I'm just saying that usability
isn't a top concern when the functionality is optional and degrades :)

WordPress.org does super-funky things in IE7, with pages disappearing 
and jumping around when you hover over the menu.

I don't have easy access to IE7, do any CSS gurus have a few minutes to 
debug what we need to sacrifice to the IE7 demons?

It isn't to me. It they did I don't think we would have seen so many

Do forget we support more than one API.  We support Movable Type,

I've seen the disappearing menues/Button on quite a few web sites. 
Ufortunately
I haven't had the resources to investigate what kind of menus/buttons it
happens to ( out of office :), but I'd think it is CSS gouverned widgets.

Even if Microsoft hides the fact a bit on their site, IE7 is a Release
candidate, and hopefully they will correct it before it gets to the official
release. It is too early to use the IE7 serously, I guess.

According to Eric Meyer, as of a few months ago, CSS behaviour won't  
change. It is, in that respect, feature complete (or incomplete,  
depending on your feelings about IE).

Yes they can.

According to my testing and code review no change is requried for either
of these bugs as it works fine.
(http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1008#comment:9)

If you are having issues with image upload over xml-rpc I would try
disabling all plugins and seeing if any of them interfere.

For what it's worth, I've had 3 clients tell me they are having problems 
with their sites in IE7. I use a conditional comment such as [if lt IE 
7]. The fix was to change that to [if lt IE 8] (or was it [if lt IE 7.1]?).

Effectively serving IE7 the same css as IE6 'fixed' it. So yeah, I'd 
have to say Eric Meyer's observation is still valid.

It's probably going to require some IE only style sheets. IE7 does some
funky stuff to a lot of sites. I test my designs in IE7 since I figure
people are going to be upgrading soon. I don't know who did the site
originally, but maybe you can drag him back to fix up some stuff.

It's a grotesque hack, but if there's some situation where a piece of
generated markup simply will not do---for whatever reason---you can do
a little str_replace/preg_replace magic to fix it up.

It may taste awful, but it does the trick, and you can always turn on
caching, to deal with any performance concerns.

It's a pretty simple fix from what I remember on css-d, but I'm running
out and don't have time to research.  Maybe someone could post a quite
note over there and someone certainly could tell you the fix.  If not,
I'll look into it tomorrow...

Sorry for the late reply. I did not know this page, thanks for the  
link. So I found out, that get_links() does what I need.
get_links() looks almost similar in syntax like wp_list_bookmarks().  
Will there be a upated version of get_links() named e.g.  
"wp_list_links()" whith a syntax like wp_list_bookmarks()?

Andr?

I ended up writing a simple plugin for this:

http://www.almosteffortless.com/wordpress/page-dump/

Basically, I re-implemented some existing WP code from the core and
hacked it up until it did what I wanted :) The idea is that it dumps
all of the pages on your site onto a single page. It preserves the
order of your pages, and shows mdash characters in front of sub-pages.

That's about it! I found that it makes it easy to turn the site into a
PDF or Word DOC or whatever the hell the client can think of. Enjoy!

It is very unlikely that www.techdirt.com is using WordPress as the CMS.

WordPress will add the following tag to the HTML source:

<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 2.0.4" /> (or whatever the version is)

Not all WordPress sites will add the tag, but most certainly will.

WordPress will not expose the plugins running on the site. Some
plugins expose themselves, such as Spam Karma 2 or Bad Behaviour, but
they are few and far between.

The best way to find out that sort of thing would be to contact the
owner of the site.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP Auto-Save drafts causing slight havoc with my plugin
Message-ID: <43253ec50610170708y2642e752u6455b87f2a813784@mail.gmail.com>

Hi. I'm writing a plugin dubbed "Match Scores" which is designed for
sports club blogs, where it will allow you to input the score of a
match into a post (via the dbx_post_advanced hook) and it will use
add_post_meta to add it to the table.

This is not my main problem, but I noticed that add_post_meta will
refuse to overwrite already existing metas. I realise there is an
update_post_meta function but then I will also have to use
get_post_meta to see if the meta already exists and whether I should
use add_post_meta or update_post_meta.

Anyway, my main question was this. What's the best way to work around
the auto-saving drafts feature of WordPress 2.1 not sending along the
custom form fields. The AJAX drafting will send only the contents of
the post, not my custom scoring fields, but the wp_insert_post hook is
still being called.

My plugin makes use of the wp_insert_post hook by deleting the post
meta if it is blank, i.e. if the user blanked the form to get rid of
the scores, or the side-effect of it also being blank when the AJAX
draft posts, thus deleting the post meta. If the custom fields are
sent along, then any of my post meta is deleted (only for this plugin)
and the fresher one is updated.

I would presume that is the normal way to do it, but the AJAX drafts
seem to have funny side-effects. Perhaps the wp_insert_post hook
should not be called when the draft is auto-saved? I noticed this
side-effect also affects Ultimate Tag Warrior, which also works in the
same way. I find that my tags are blanked after an auto-save took
place.

My project page is here, where there is a link to the current source code:

There are sometimes tell-tale signs, but not always.  The names of some 
classes/IDs in a theme might hint at something, or might not.  The permalink 
structure.  Certainly any files with "wp-" prefix. ;)

I'm guessing techdirt is home-grown, but it really could just as easily be 
built on top of an existing blog system (doesn't look like a nuke-like CMS, 
looks like a blog...).

Well, its the easiest thing to not add that tag. The best way to tell  
is the stylesheet, in WordPress it'll be in /wp-content/themes/

Erm...
Ever try Spam Karma 2?
It does just that: it's one "shell" plugin that runs a series of different
anti-spam plugins and then adds up their result into a "spam index" that
determines its fate.
Check it out.

Spam Karma 2 works fine ... but what we have with wordpress is multiple 
plugins competing with Spam Karma instead of multiple plugins working as 
SK-plugins ... right? I rewrote the Akismet plugin, so it can be used 
with Spam Karma ... others don't do that.

If wordpress had an universal anti-spam plugin interface (letting 
multiple plugins judge a comment, weight these decisions and than flag 
it as either spam or ham or moderate) in the core, rewriting wouldn't be 
neccessary and there would be some development on the anti-spam front 
(Spam Karma had no update for ages now) ...

Ah... 'k.. get you know.

I agree.. the whole thing is littered with hooks, so why not Akismet as well
:)

What's the DL URI for your plugin?

My idea is to create another "hook" where all spam-plugins shall return their 
weight value into it:

- Zero: No comments / cannot complain about it / plugin doesn't know how to 
deal with it
- minus values: more spam than ham
- plus values: more ham than spam :-)

An example:

plugin-one.php
<?php
function plugin_add_rating ($currRating) {
	$myRating = 0;
	// Some analysis bla bla
	return $currRating + $myRating;
}

add_filter('comment_spam_rating', 'plugin_add_rating');

?>

Now somewhere in WP's core we need a "handler" to decide if spam/ham or 
moderate:

function wp_spam_rater ($comment_ID) {
	$totalSpamRating = apply_filter('comment_spam_rating', $comment_ID);
	if ($totalSpamRating == 0) {
		// Send it to the admin as "moderated"
		do_action('comment_rating_moderation', $comment_ID);
		return '0';
	} elseif ($totalSpamRating < 0) {
		// Send it to the admin as "spam"
		do_action('comment_rating_spam', $comment_ID);
		return 'spam';
	} elseif ($totalSpamRating > 0) {
		// Send it to the admin as "approved"
		do_action('comment_rating_approve', $comment_ID);
		return '1';
	}

}

Got it? :-)

I think this new behavior is going to cause some chaos with various  
plugins, and it's worth talking about. A new plugin I'm working on  
will be affected here, and I've been trying to figure out th best way  
to handle it without adding a large load to each save/update.

Should there be an "auto-save" state that doesn't fire any of the  
standard "post creation" hooks? If not, then I think we have to  
expect plugins that need to do something "on post save" will likely  
cause the auto-save function to become heavier as they each have to  
check their existing data, the add/update their meta as needed.

I'm not saying that the WP behavior should change, I'm saying that  
plugin devs have likely relied on existing behavior that is now  
slightly different because it no longer requires user interaction.  
Perhaps a "best practice" doc in codex from someone who is intimate  
with all of the "post saving" hooks is a good solution.

Cheers,

I'm not opposed to making autosave perform like a normal post draft
save. The requests to the server will become larger, and its a little
bit more difficult to maintain. We could also somehow add some hooks
in the javascript that add whatever a plugin wants to the autosave
request. I'd rather not extend the WP API to have a special state on
the backend for autosave in wp_insert_post or wp_update_post, etc.

Good idea ... I think it could be handled only by plugins, too ...

Anti-spam plugins would hook into preprocess_comment and do whatever 
check they do (against Akismet, a RBL, etc). They would have to save 
their result into some global array (the same one for all plugins 
dealing with spam). Then, in the pre_comment_approved hook the 
uber-anti-spam-plugin collects the values in this global array and 
decides whether it's spam or ham.

Needs no modification of the core ... or am I wrong?

At first glance, that sounds like the best solution.  I really don't  
think auto-save should be saving any other data, like custom post  
fields.

Spam Karma 2 does exactly this.  There is an SK2 Akismet component.

The topic here is the standalone Akismet plugin, so we're getting a  
bit off track.

The topic on the spam-stopper list was about standalone Akismet. It got 
offtopic there, so Roland continued on the wp-hackers list.

And yes, Spam Karma 2 does this, but nobody develops for it ...

I would recommend that *negative* spam rankings = less spammy, like  
SpamAssassin does. So

	elseif ($totalSpamRating < 0) {

And things like whitelisting give the message a -100 score, etc. Just  
for semantic consistency with other systems.

They don't?

Just a few of the SK2 plugins out there not written by drDave:

http://www.grooblehonk.co.uk/sk2/rbl-plugin/
http://www.sebbi.de/archives/2006/01/31/spam-karma-2-akismet-plugin/
http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/sk2-simple-digest-plugin/
http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/sk2-moderate-plugin/
http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2006/08/04/a-new-kind-of-pingback-spam/

Two of which are included in the core SK2 distribution.

They are very easy to write - as easy as writing a WordPress plugin in fact.

Okay, I have grabbed them all. But some people does not.

I guess they are not against SK2 nor Dr. Dave. :-) But they just don't want to 
use SK2 for what reason they have. They shall have this reason and you cannot 
force them to use product A (SK2) to have product B (e.g. my CPR plugin).

Anyway. Your script is in GPL and GPL allows us all to write our own version - 
with new title and version number, of course - when we like.

I already have some reasons to not upgrade to 2.1 or what comes next because 
this will destroy my (released) patched core scripts.

With this hook we are talking here we all (or maybe some of us) have another 
reason to not upgrade. That means in other words: Sooner or later people will 
go away from WP because an other "split" of WP is much better than the 
original one.

I guess Matt is interested in patches which makes his core script 
more "comfortable" to us plug-in coders. So why is he not taking his chance 
in this matter? Maybe he does already think in background about this 
idea. :-) Let's hope it! ;-)

And a little extension to the core files (no changes, just a new core 
function) and we can continue develop WP plugins and not SK2-plugins :-)

I don't see why autosave shouldn't save *everything*.

Here's an idea:
1. Submit the entire form via ajax.
2. That entire post array is saved in the appropriate post's  
'_wp_auto_save' custom field.
3. On normal save, delete that field.
4. On edit of post with that field, say "WP has recovered some  
automatically saved data for this post, would you like to use it".   
Click the link and it populates the form with the data from the  
custom field.

Advantages:
1. When working on an already published post, changes won't go live  
as WP autosaves.
2. Since the post and the autosave data are stored in different  
places, there's no chance for a data destroying race condition.
3. Easy to maintain on the JS side.  We just grab everything in the  
form and send it.  No need to pick out specific fields.
4. Autosave wouldn't need to trigger post_save or post_edit (or  
whatever the hooks are).

Disadvantages:
1. More bandwidth.
2. A little more coding on the backend.

(Ask.)

Techdirt is using a highly modified version of Slash, the ancient CMS 
that grew out of Slashdot. However they were getting killed by spam, so 
their integrated Akismet into their version of Slash, which they report 
has solved the problem.

You're calling functions that are defined in pluggable.php, which is
loaded after plugins. You need to delay the execution of that code to
the init action.

Greetings,

I am developing a plugin and would like to allow admin users to enter
text in a form (in the administration), have it saved to the DB, and
then output it wherever needed.  I have everything as I like it except
that if the user wants to have markup in the text (as submitted by the
backend form) then things go funny.  It looks like update_option is
sanitizing the input an striping out dangerous input.  Probably a good
idea.

My question, is there a way to allow users to use only certain markup
like a href and IMG?

Thanks,
Kirk

It shouldn't be.  It could just be that you need to do:

> echo wp_specialchars(get_option('your_option'), true);

When you are printing out your backend <input />s  You need to  
convert HTML entities and quotes when inside a value="" parameter.

Still, Robert is right... if you want to allow some HTML and block  
others, you should additionally be passing the output (on the front  
end) through KSES to prevent things like script execution.

We've also seen some problems where people click publish and the post 
reverts to a draft or a previous version of the post.

OMG! I thought I was imagining things! For me, posts were going into DRAFT
and were not being published. I simply thought I had been careless when
clicking buttons.

On the subject of buttons, wouldn't it be nice to have some colouring on the
SAVE | SAVE and CONTINUE | PUBLISH buttons to set them apart visually? Just
a thought.

I would posit that an independent plugin system like that would always 
be less effective because none of the weightings would know anything 
about the other weightings, and it would really only be useful to people 
interested in endlessy tweaking the scoring. You'd have to test every 
change in weighting against a non-trivial corpus of known spam and ham. 
(At least a million of each.)

Also how would you weight an external system like Akismet, which already 
does thousands of tests and is being constantly adjusted?

I don't like tests that sit on the fence. Either call it or don't.

You are right. I even do this in the Spam Karma version of the Akismet 
plugin ... it skips this test if the other tests are fairly sure it's 
spam or ham. So the order and the weighting lead to the final decision, 
but getting both right could be too much for the ordinary user ...

> Also how would you weight an external system like Akismet, which

I'd weight Akismet very low, because it is external. It simply has not 
as much information about the comment as I (meaning my webserver) have, 
so it can only be a rough filter or a last test if other tests don't 
lead to a clear decision, but nothing perfect (Akismet still does not 
recognize a minimum of 2 spams a day on my blog).

Akismet is the Dirty Harry of spam protection.  5 shots or 6?  Pull  
the trigger and find out.   Punk.  :-)

If you send me your blog URL I can look up your exact stats, but unless 
you are getting tens of thousands of spams per day 2 getting through is 
really unusual. When I see reduced effectiveness like that, it's 
generally because of an external factor, like another plugin overriding 
the response, bad network connectivity on the server, or not enough data 
being sent to Akismet, for example if a plugin as not sending everything 
to Akismet. (The more comments it gets from a blog, the more effective 
it becomes.)

I think Widgets should be a default inclusion ala Akismet and svn
externalized in the same manner.

I think so - do we need to move the old funcs to deprecated and
reimplement as calls to the new code? #2587

Deprecation of start_wp. Also affects the Exporter. #3188

Rewrite fixes for feeds when permalinks start /%category%/

Yes, please!  I think if we all pitch in, we might be able to get  
this thing released before we all start taking winter holiday  
breaks... preferably a week before, so we don't have a repeat of the  
2.0 release (issues cropped up, but most of us were on vacation).

> * Uploader improvements. (mdawaffe)

I'd like to see attachment URLs move to post_meta.  We're using the  
GUID as the URL, and that really sucks.  It has the domain hardcoded  
in there (needed to keep it globally unique), so if you move domains  
or directories, you need to edit the GUID (manually) and by doing so  
you're breaking your GUIDs.  We're better than this.  We need to move  
completely to WP-directory-relative links and fill in the get_option 
('siteurl') on the fly.

I'll take a look.

Matt mentioned the possibility of adding tagging to the core, for  
those crazy people (okay, me) who tag AND categorize.  My patch is  
aimed at allowing people to use the current system as a tagging OR a  
categorization system, but not really both at the same time.  We'd  
need type="tag" in post2cat or even a new rel table if we were going  
to support both.  We could use parts of my patch for the tagging part  
(taking out the hierarchical code).  That may be a bit ambitious for  
2.1   If that's where we're headed in 2.2 (tags + categories),  
applying my patch for 2.1 as an interim solution might only confuse  
people.

> * Autosave tweaking.  Still have some edge case bugs here.

We need to decide how autosave will handle stuff like postmeta and  
any other random form elements that may be inserted by plugins (see  
the hackers thread on this).  Plus, there have been some reports of  
published posts disappearing.

> * wp_cron and future posts.  Any remaining issues?

This needs to be solid, as future posts depend on it.  It has me a  
bit worried (mostly because of potential server-specific quirks).

> * Page on front.  We still have some issues lingering.

Point me to 'em.  This is a big "selling point" for 2.1

> * Import/Export.  Remaining issues?  Sufficient to replace DB

It's not sufficient to replace DB backup at this point.  Is our goal  
to replace DB dump/import functionality completely (i.e. all the  
tables)?

> * Bundling.  Include widgets?  Include scriptaculous?

I like the idea of bundling widgets.  I was doing a project for a  
company, sticking their widget in the WP sidebar... was trying to  
sell them on making it a widget, but they weren't happy with the  
penetration of the widgets plugin (so we ended up using the less  
versatile wp_meta hook).  It definitely fills a gap.  Do we do it as  
a bundled plugin or do we make it core?

> * Other stuff?

Will pipe up as it comes to me.

Agreed.  Fix attachments now and make complete relativity a 2.2 goal.

Okay, push the tagging issue to 2.2.  For 2.1 we just need to decide 
whether to show all cats when writing posts and links or filter the list 
somehow.

Yep.  Definitely needs some investigation.  I wonder if mdawaffe's 
recent AJAX work would help here.  I thought he added a way of blocking 
and waiting when multiple things are bumping.

Some of the ideas in the last hackers thread for reducing contention 
sounded good.  We should try one of those.

#3234 is one issue, with a patch from mdawaffe.  Also #2515 and #2792. 
  One of those has your move_front_page patch.  As you say in the bug, 
that workaround is kinda ugly.  I'd rather not provide context using a 
new arg.

I think we should provide a means of preserving post and page IDs so 
that links do not break.

I'm down with doing it either way.  Widgets is seeing pretty broad 
support in new themes, so including it as core might be good.

You're not the only one. I have UTW on my WIP blog that'll replace my
current one and I really prefer to file posts under categories and
then tag it with some subject words.

I'd die if I didn't have categories. :(

Hi,

I have just come across the following exotic island:

http://groups.google.com/group/wp-hackers?lnk=sg

I  realise that it's probably experimental, but as curiosity
strikes  I just wanted to know the intent of this. I  notice
that  there  is  a moderation queue on subscription  and  no
ability  to  post  (i.e.  read-only).  This  reminds  me  of
discussions  which  go  back  almost  2  years---those  that
revolved  around  opening  the  list to  other  channels  of
access.

The only other mailing list which I know registers itself as

Oops. This is the second time that I start a thread on a  
previously-discussed topic. I guess that the  subject line wasn't  
informative enough at the  time.

Hi everyone,

I've written a number of plugins for wordpress and I'd like to write
more.  Everything I've learned I've picked up via the web having never
taken a programming course in High School or University.  I'm certain
that the code I write is not very efficient or well thought out, and,
although it does get the job done I think I'm reaching the end of
things I can learn on my own.

So I'm looking for a mentor, someone (or someones) who can answer a
question or two once and awhile and point me in the right direction,
look over my work, and generally tutor me and keep me on the straight
and narrow.  While WP-hackers is a great resource to turn to for
questions and advice, but there is no 'overall plan' and the
questioner really dictates their own learning.  A mentor would be able
to provide the guidance needed to grow and already know what the
mentoree needs to learn.

I'd really enjoy the opportunity of working with someone (or a group
of people together) on making plugins / WordPress improvements /
tinkering for the benefit of the whole of the WordPress community.  As
I see it, the main benefit of being a mentorer would be the
satisfaction of helping someone grow and watching that person help
others.

What do you think, are there people out there in the WP community
willing to help out others in this manner?  Is this a good idea?

perhaps in the immediate future, the WordPress project should consider
taking part in SoC sponsored by Google. :)

Exposing my complete-lack-of-technical-knowlege-fu, but one thing that
frustrates me about widgets is the all or nothingness of them. As I
understand it, a sidebar may contain widgets but that precludes other
sidebar goodies, no? In other words, I can have widgets, or sidebar
functions that call non-widget stuff, but not both.
Am I missing something here? I guess I don't truly understand what widgets
are, in terms of how they function and interact with my site or site's
theme.

Technically - yes.
Realistically - no.

You can use both by turning on widgets then installing a widget that lets you use traditional sidebar functions:

Surely you can just put your regular, theme-based sidebar stuff in your
theme's sidebar.php, just below or above the widget code? That's what I used
to do, before I decided I didn't need the non-widget stuff :)

I know I would be willing to help out in this way, and have considered
it before but nobody has really ever requested the help. I've thought
about, like Steve said, being a mentor if nobody else was willing for
anyone who would like to take part in the SoC since I am disqualified
as a student. So, if you or anyone else wants someone who's just
around to ask questions, check out code, point you in the right
direction, etc., I'm willing to help, and I'm sure I'm not the only
one who would be willing to help.

Many of the best open source developers I know gave themselves some
direction and positioned themselves for mentoring by fixing bugs.

http://trac.wordpress.org/report/13 shows all 391 bugs looking for a
debugger and then hacker. Even looking at one a week and adding some
context based on your investigation can make a significant difference.

There were discussions about this before (applications too, IIRC), yet  
I worry that Blogger and Blogspot lead to conflicting interests. Then  
again, Drupal competes with Google's equivalents to an extent; same  
with KOffice... and yet they both got Google's assistance.

Best wishes,

Roy

Subject: [wp-hackers] Constant problems with plugins and hooks
Message-ID: <6930458.post@talk.nabble.com>


I have constant problems with plugins that hook into all my pages.

Whilst some plugin authors have attempted to add some level of "selectivity"
to their plugins, so that the plugins only hook into certain types of posts,
or certain page slugs, it rarely works on all pages.

Thus you end up switching off all automatic hooks, and placing the function
calls manually in each template.

Is there a need for some kind of universal plugin or feature in the core
that can be used by all plugin authors to control exactly which pages or
posts a plugin is allowed to hook into?

The ultimate aim would be to have a system such that you can switch theme,
and not have to make 100s of modifications to your template for simple
plugins for bookmarking etc.

Maybe implement it just as a barrier. Have an interface of active plugins,
and currently template files, and allow or disallow the plugin to
automatically hook into a certain template.

I am not a programmer, I just uncover problems I need solutions for. If I
can't find solutions, I feed them through to my programmers.
Whilst I haven't looked into this in depth, I have a feeling this would
require some form of modification to the core. That is potentially ok for my
own sites, but not very suitable for widespread distribution.

It could alternatively be created as an include for future plugin authors to
use, but that would require widescale adoption by plugin authors and updates
to plugins that already exist, which I feel is a little drastic.

Maybe this is something that is already going to be included in some future
version of Widgets, such that maybe  you would have multiple "widget
templates" that control all code relating to every hook on every template,
independant of the templates themselves.

It is possible some of the commercial offerings offer some of this
functionality, and if I implemented it, in all honestly it would also have
to be a semi-commercial undertaking with some form of pro version for those

* Bundling.  Include widgets?  Include scriptaculous?

I have no problems with Widgets being bundled, but I wouldn't want it as
part of the core.

I will most likely sometime in the future have to start working on a branch
project. I am working on a comprehensive ebook publishing solution using
Wordpress, and I intend including a way of extracting PDFs from it.

One problem I still have to work out is how to have a sanitised version of
pages, which have the benefits of some plugins, but not others

I am doing something similar with my ebook plugin

Drafts/backups are being saved as XML, and only get parsed for custom tags
and inserted into the wordpress database as pages when an ebook is finally
published. If you were publishing a 400 page ebook, and changed the
pagination slightly, it could have got quite nasty.

I made that mistake on my first post to the list (which wasn't that long
ago)

Now I just use Nabble.com if I see something I want to post to, and quite
often end up replying to a few more threads I might not have otherwise seen.

This seems awfully tangential... wasn't this discussion about auto-save 
basically bypassing many plugins?

In any case, if you're doing an ebook, and pagination is constantly 
changing, why isn't it a single post/page with pagination tags (i.e., 
nextpage)?  Or some form of auto-pagination, with special tags only when 
needed.  Then again, I don't think editing a 400-page ebook through 
wordpress is necessarily a great idea... ;)

Wow, Nabble sounds great.  They (1) take content from lists they don't own
without permission, (2) don't allow list owners to opt out without sending a
DMCA request to their lawyer, (3) make it very easy for bots to scrape
private email addresses for spam, and (according to their TOS) owns
everything that you post.

Whoever owns this list should think about blocking posts to and from Nabble
immediately.

Do you have a single legitimate reason for wanting to keep such crucial core

Some people would want to disable it, therefore it's best left as a "core
plugin", like Akismet is? I certainly agree with that line of
thought?similar to wanting TinyMCE included as a plugin rather than actually
being integrated.

Just like about another million "nntp scraper sites" except for mailing lists.

Seeing as WP-Hackers is an email mailing list _open to the public_ and
*not* private membership nor does it come with a EULA that says you
can't use the content except in an email client, how the hell is what
Nabble does illegal?

I have a company & a website & products, and I for one would welcome
anything that gave my lists greater coverage. Not everyone can use
mailing lists with ease, and what Nabble does can't hurt you in any
way at all.

As far the scraping of email addresses goes: I could write a PHP
script to grab that info of the pipermail archives in 10 minutes flat.

Their ToS "claims" to own everything, but that's just legal nonsense
like signing a paper that says "you can't sue the company you work
for:" it's a fright tatic and inadmissible in court.

And :blink: do you seriously not know who owns this mailing list?????
It sounds more like you have bone to pick with Nabble (which I just
heard about for the first time ever), wanna explain?

Perhaps you'd like to try, but I have yet to see the case made in any
reasonable fashion that widgets are a "crucial core functionality."

The only reason Akismet is a plugin is because it requires a third-party 
key to use it. TinyMCE will never be a plugin, unless we switch to a 
better WYSIWYG.

By "owns", I mean the list mom that's responsible for its day-to-day

See the note from Mark previously in the thread.  If widgets are a gimmick
rather than something that should be an intrinsic feature of the platform,
then you're right, and there's no reason for them to be in core.

This purist obsession with "keeping things out of the core" will eventually
start to hurt rather than help WP.  To most users, WP development appears to
have been in a stall for the last year, and even 2.0 had very few
user-oriented features (besides WYSIWYG editing, which most on this list
seem to detest).

Where is the vision?

Fair enough. I like the idea of plugins as modularity as well as
extensibility, though.

CG, Charles,

Nabble's  use of content is not much different from Google's
exploitation  of  UseNet. The difference is magnitude...  of
the company and the content used (or 'scraped', depending on
your  point-of-view).  By  coincidence, I happened  to  have
blogged  about it this morning. What bothers me the most are
the  copyright  footers and the poor  contributions  (input)
that result from a poor UI. Many of us who access UseNet the
normal  way  just killfile/score/filter all G2  posts.  That
issue of copyrights, fair use, and the rest of that malarkey
was  explained rather well in Brad Templeton's classic essay
on  copyright  myths. It probably covers everything that  we
argue  about---something  that  could soon  devolve  into  a
flamewar.

Best wishes,

Roy

Personally I think plugins solve the type of problem where multiple
solutions are possible.

For some things making them plugins just for 80% of the user base to
enable them is a bad idea.

- From this point of view I agree with Akismet being a plugin as it isn't
the only solution to the problem it is trying to address.  There are
many different solutions out there and people need to pick the one that
works for them.

I would also agree with widgets becoming a core feature as it would be
silly for multiple different implementations to compete.  We need one
implementation which all theme authors can use to make there themes more
modular and easier for the end-user to customise.

The 80% rule above is what kills ripping TinyMCE out and making it a
plugin - most end-users expect it to be there - it is the type of
editing environment they are familiar with.

Google Groups is just a web interface/gateway to Usenet.

Is Nabble scraping content from Google Groups, or from the list directly?

Would anyone reply to messags from the 80's? The raison detre of  
Google was to provide access to content, maybe provide some tools  
(e.g. Google Video, Goo-Tube, Web authoring, blog hosting), but not to  
become a repository.


> Is Nabble scraping content from Google Groups, or from the list directly?


The list, in the form of E-mail input. In any case, the archives are  
static. With an Alexa rank of ~8000, however gross and inaccurate  
these things may be, it's nothing to sneeze at. Lastly, it uses a  
viral marketing technique to spread itself.

Then again, many so-called 'forums' use the same techniques to absorb  
'Googlejuice'. The problematic ones are those who claim or/and pretend  
to have content ownership. One such example would be JLA forums who  
scrape our Linux advocacy forum. And all that said, I concur with CG  
who said that proliferation of the content may serve our interests as  
well. It's not backed by advertisements and no knowledge is being  
traded /per se/.

Best wishes,

Roy

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin author stats
Message-ID: <453AD96E.4070703@mullenweg.com>

Since March we've been tracking download stats for various plugins, and 
it seemed like as good a time as any to expose them:

http://wordpress.org/extend/stats/plugins/

Since most people don't use our download system yet, here's an example 
of one that has used it since launch:

http://wordpress.org/extend/stats/plugins/widgets/

Here's one that got a lot of downloads when I blogged it and then since 
I haven't promoted or linked it anywhere has trailed off:

http://wordpress.org/extend/stats/plugins/no-www/

As we build out an official plugin directory on wp.org, this data will 
be used in that somehow, so if you're a plugin author consider using 
downloads.wordpress.org for your official download URL.

Any other ideas for stuff we could expose?

I wasn't aware of this.  Is there some way to control which version is

Wow... 8000
I should have checked that :)

But one difference I _did_ notice is that Nabble appends a link to
itself at the bottom of every mesage (was this the "viral" marketing
you were talking about?)
Google Groups doesn't do that.... but then again, does it hurt us?
that's the biggest question.

(Thanks Roy, the site is back up now, and I'm going dedicated this
weeek so that won't happen again!)

Do these businesses sign up for WP's commercial support? Or do their

Not really, the data handling of draft posts is pretty similar, which was
why I mentioned it.

This is going off track now slightly ;) The way it works isn't far removed
from using more tags, there is an automatic pagination mode, but the
resulting content is published as nested pages (book >> chapter >> page).
Other ways were considered and then rejected mainly from an seo point of
view, but also ease of inplementation and editing of content.

Wordpress is going to work well for this application, once a book is
imported, with the automatic pagination (and other automatic includes), each
page can then be edited individually, or reprocessed as a multipage tagged
document

But back on track.

If someone was to make a post split over 50 pages using more tags, how would
the autosave cope with it?

Widgets for me is like a stub in Wikipedia. The idea is there, but it hasn't
really been followed through

My biggest problem with Widgets is that theme authors have to design their
themes to support it, many support it partially, I don't think any theme
publisher supports it as well as it could be implemented. Most themes have
one sidebar for all files, and many Widget implementations only place
widgets on index.php

The current API allows a theme author to have a different sidebar on every
template, if they designed their theme that way.

An extended version of Widgets could effectively be used to cover editing
other page elements, including within the loop, before or after comments, in
the header or footer.

The problem is that theme authors would have to support all the added
functionality, and it invalidates all the great work done in the past. 

Widgets isn't the only way a total solution could be achieved as I discussed
in my recent post "Constant problems with plugins and hooks"

I am a believer that a solution is necessary - I absolutely hate having to
retinker every aspect of a page if I switch theme, and especially having to
do it all again with each new blog I start. It is great if you only have 1
blog to worry about, but if you have 10+ it starts getting frustrating.

A smart implementation of Widgets which handles all aspects of tweaking on
every template would reduce a lot of the barriers to updating to new
versions of wordpress.

Widgets is just a first generation solution, and is not a complete solution
because there is an inate barrier for theme authors to implement it totally.

So why not in the core?

It puts an additional barrier to adoption of alternative solutions or
improvements.

I haven't found info on how uploading is handled

Many theme authors don't use the theme directory because it currently
doesn't encourage visits to authors sites as much as previous
implementations, and doesn't supply as much Google Juice.

Site visits and Google Juice are 2 of the main reasons plugin authors create
plugins. Obviously not the only reasons, but there is a lot of additional
work making something public that was intended for personal use.

Obviously you shouldn't force a user to go to a website to download, but you
should be presented with a link to go to the website specific to the plugin
alongside any download link (which the theme viewer doesn't provide)

Anyone that tried to visit my site a couple of days ago got a "Account
Suspended" message from my host thanks to Neowin, OSNews, Slashdot, and
Digg. They were accessing a WordPress post.

I'm moving to a dedicated server, but I want complete optimization. I'm
hacking wp-cache to work with IIS (yes, it's a Windows Server, and no,
Windows Server 2003 is NOT bad), and was thinking about a PHP cache
implementation as well - since I had wp-cache and a lot of other
optimizations running on CentOS w/ Apache on my VPS earlier.

I was thinking of eAccelerator as a php caching solution, then I started to
wonder why I don't just run PHP as completely compiled code.

Has anyone run WordPress under RoadSend or Phalanger?

RoadSend: http://www.roadsend.com/home/index.php?SMC=1
Phalanger: http://php-compiler.net

Benchmarks of Phalanger and some alongside RoadSend:
http://www.php-compiler.net/Benchmarks.htm

Does anyone even know if WordPress will compile? Sometimes "quirky" code can
create issues.

Just food for thought :)

Yes, I witnessed this. The mirrors failed as well.

BlobPress?  I think it's a dangerous territory to  approach.
If  you were ever to encourage this type of thing, you would
soon  lose many of the benefits of Open Source. There  would
be  those who are tempted to choose a compiled version  over
one  that's  interpreted. Consequently, this  translates  to
less  hacking  (the benevolent connotation), which  empowers
WordPress  through  plug-ins  and  bug  fixes  (reports  and
patches).  And that's just one among many beneficial aspects
that you would lose.

Why  not create static pages (selectively, of course)? If  I
recall  correctly, there was a long thread about this in the
end  of April. I suspect that there are plugins that address
the issue of server spikes and heavy loads.

I'm  afraid  I can't offer an answer, but if it was over  to
become a downloadable edition, imagine the implications on:

* Security updates

* Plugins (hooks, modification, etc)

* Maintaining multiple distributions

* More stuff...


> Just food for thought :)

I  am not familiar with benchmarks that compare compiled PHP
with more conventional forms (with or without some caching).
However, based on my experience with MATLAB I can assure you
that  compiling  what was geared towards  interpretation  of
code   leads  to  very  small  (if  not  negligible)  gains.
Languages  as such are /already/ being heavily optimised  to
deliver  splendid  performance  without  compilation  (think
PostScript, for instance). Compilation is better as means of
preventing access to source code.

A  properly-constructed syntax is needed to build  something
that's translated into good binaries which take advantage of
decade-old  compilers.  PHP  is,  after  all,  not  a  naive
debugger. Also bear in mind the issue of mobility. Would you
like  to see WordPress cease to work when you move it  onto,
let  us  say, a SPARC-based Sun server? Would your  compiler
(maybe a pricey commercial one) be still of any value?

In summary, caching, multiple servers, or static pages might
be your best solution to spikes. YMMV.

Best wishes,

Roy

OK... maybe I'm lost.

First, thanks for the reply Roy.. But I'm not seeing these issues.

I thought "compiled PHP" means that you take the PHP files, put them through
Phalanger/RoadSend, and then serve the compiled code instead.
No one "makes these files available," rather every time I make a change to
my site, add a plugin, modify a line of code or else update from SVN - I
recompile it via the program.

I think it's on-the-fly compilation, i.e. they serve the PHP files instead
of the PHP CGI/SAPI extension....

It's nothing to do with the distribution, and the code doesn't change: I
don't get C++ code out and then run the executable, rather every time I
change the PHP code I have RoadSend re-compile and display the new
content....

I don't see that: I install WP on my server, add the plugins I want, then
compile the whole enchilada.

Too much hassle - this is a set-it-and-forget-it kind of thing :) and it's
always on just in case of an unexpected traffic spike.

Again, unless I'm reading it wrong, that's not the way compiled PHP goes.
It's a per-user kind of thing, not a "fork" or something that I can put up
on my site for other people to use. Am I wrong? Sorry... My first experience
with compiled PHP.

I don't know if this was discussed (must have missed the thread if so) but
recently the trunk WP has jacked up the font size by something around
120-160% in wp-admin.
This includes the menus, the plugin editors, the feed-grabber, and
more......

I liked it small :'(

"On-the-fly compilation" stands out as an oxymoron. *smile*

If you seek minor gains, then you could, in principle, run an  
optimiser through the code. It would strip off comments, shorten  
variable names, but made no syntactic changes. Then, if you wish to  
modify the source, go to the original branch, edit, and reduce the  
complexity of the code again. I wonder if benchmarks exist to show how  
this affects WordPress performance. This could get interesting,  
although it depends on a myriad of factors (e.g. server specs, tasks  
tested, optimisation type, cache/nocache).

This assumes that you know what you are doing. I thought that you  
proposed compiling WordPress and making available to Joe Bloggs.

With /. you're talking about orders of magnitude (at least for most of  
the WP-based Web sites out there). A marginal performance gain that's  
attributed to compilation is unlikely to {save the day}^tm, so to speak.

I was wrongly assuming that you want this option to reach people who  
are not Computer Gurus.

Got you know Roy, I understand your concerns perfectly.
No, this is your "typical"

I guess now I just DL RoadSend, Benchmark, and see for myself :)

The most annoying page as a result of this is the Plugins page IMO. You
can barely fit a two-word plugin name in the table without it wrapping.

Reminds me of an issue that has just been resolved (plugins
conflict)...

While you guys bring up stuff with some hesitance, I thought
I'd ask this:

Is there any chance of bringing old wp-hackers archives back
to  life?  Archives  from  June 2004  onwards  (formerly  on
http://wordpress.org/mailman/listinfo/hackers_wordpress.org
) are virtually inexistent.

Best wishes,

Roy

I'm -1 for it becoming core simply because it currently is competing,
and with a competitor that is vastly better.

I'd vote http://nybblelabs.org.uk/projects/sidebar-modules/ to be
included by default and/or as core over Widgets any day.

Subject: [wp-hackers] REQUEST_URI on IIS isn't SCRIPT_NAME
Message-ID: <001401c6f5d7$ba3188a0$2e9499e0$@net>

I'm porting my site over to IIS and it's going great, but for one thing: I
don't like "index.php" at the end of a url, so I have a quick script that
removes it.

$blog_sub = "wordpress";

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] == "/" . $blog_sub . "/index.php") {
header('HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently');
header('Location: ' . "http://" . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . "/" . $blog_sub .
'/');
exit(); 
}

Per http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1488, IIS doesn't have REQUEST_URI, it
uses SCRIPT_NAME instead - but there's a problem.

Whenever I ran this I'd get an infinite loop... In the end I realized that
REQUEST_URI and SCRIPT_NAME aren't equal: the first is the name of the
script the end user called for, the latter is the actual script being run.
With SCRIPT_NAME, /index.php and / are exactly the same thing. They both
point to index.php and give me hell.

Does anyone know of a way on IIS to check the actual path requested and not
the script being engaged? 

I can think of several other plugins that I am using (many of them not mine)
that need this info for proper IIS compatibility as well......

Any ideas? This (http://www.php.net/reserved.variables) is of no use.

Neither do I, but it was ported over from WordPress.com by Matt himself:

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4349#file25

Web 2.0 I guess or something, but I'm personally not blind and run a
large (1600x1200) resolution for a reason (so I have small fonts and
can see lots on my screen).

Exactly! Small means more productivity, it's been proven.
I personally have a pitiful 1280x1024 (just can't justify the price of a new
monitor when there are more pressing things), and I don't like wasting any
of it.
I use Opera's dynamic zoom to make everything smaller on that page, but as a
result "normal" text becomes illegible.

Tried dumping $_SERVER to see if there's anything useful there? MSDN
list[1] a couple of possible variables: URL, UNENCODED_URL,
HTTP_URL...

Sidebar modules is just as bad in the other direction as widgets, it's 
needlessly complicated and has a bad UI. If anything was included it'd 
be somewhere in the middle.

If you look here:

http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/

You'll notice that some plugins have different versions. When tags are 
used a version zip is created and you can link people to that.

Well, there *is* a difference. People naturally like attribution and credit.
Indexing entries on a site is one thing, but virtually going out of your way
to keep them away from the author's site isn't exactly motivating for themes
and plugin authors....

Once an actual directory is done I'm sure it will drive far more traffic 
to authors than they ever got on their own. (WordPress.org gets millions 
of visitors a month. It doesn't link out enough now.)

However the above tool is purely for plugin authors, that's why it's 
unlinked anywhere on the site. It doesn't parse anything out of the 
plugin so it's actually dumb to everything but the name.

I think this is pretty cool. The auto-zipping feature with tags is
sweet, and I think that an "official" plugin repository for WP is
going to be a great thing in the long run.

FYI, that's not the official Colbert site, it's a fan site, from what I can
tell.  I certainly would hope Comedy Central would do a better job.

In his show he always refers to it though. It's the #1 fan site for him.

Shame, they should have used Democracy:

I find it to be much, much better than WP-Polls or whatever that is.

No, none of them work... They all return the actual script's path instead of
the virtual directory or alias.

I found something that'll suffice: $_SERVER['PATH_TRANSLATED'];  
It's nonsense, it takes apache's REQUESTED_URI and prepends the document
root, such that for a page titled "About" in WP it would show
C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\wordpress\about

No point to it as far as I can see, but by 

$REQUESTE_URI = str_replace("\", "/", str_replace($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"],
"", $_SERVER['PATH_TRANSLATED']));

Seems to work.

Hackaday job... but it'll do the trick.. I bet this changes from IIS to IIS,
it just doesn't seem right. But it'll do well enough for my implementation.

Thanks Matt, clears things up :)
I was already planning on using it, my point was more of a general reason
why most devs most likely aren't.

I've had success with this:

$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = ( isset($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']) ? $_SERVER 
['REQUEST_URI'] : $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] . (( isset($_SERVER 
['QUERY_STRING']) ? '?' . $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] : '')));

Thanks for the reply, Alex... But are you sure?
Because REQUEST_URI *is* set on IIS (contrary to what my first post
implied), but it doesn't return the requested URI, rather the actual script
being run.

Try this:
Create an index.php that echos REQUEST_URI and put it in a folder.

Calling that folder: http://mydomain.com/foldername/

on Apache or Lighttpd will echo "/foldername/"
But on IIS it will return "/foldername/index.php"

...

:(

The code fragment in my last email kinda works, except if you're in the root
dir it gives issues....
Using mod_rewrite for now.. :(

I just worked out why the way to access uploading ecaped me. It is fed
directly from wp-plugins.org (mentioned in the archives May 2005)

Will the system remain exclusive to those using wp-plugins.org ?

There isn't a requirement for theme authors submitting to
themes.wordpress.net to publish them under a GPL compatible license, there
is a seperate upload mechanism. Wp-plugins.org on the other hand is
exclusively for GPL compatible.

Some authors choose to use an alternate license (for various reasons),
others are forced to because they use code that might not be GPL compatible.
(e.g I used some stuff from Dynamic Drive in the past)


Regarding layout, it was just an observation. I am sure there is a benefit
in total traffic, and obviously in downloads for a theme.

Users are not encouraged to view the details about a theme, it is all one
click downloads. It is obvious from the 1000s of downloads for themes that
don't have comments or a rating.

There might be a difference in the type of traffic that ultimately goes to
the author's website. If someone downloads a theme, uploads it, activates
it, and they are happy, there is a high chance they will never visit the
authors website.
The people who will visit are the ones with problems.

Thus having the download button available immediately could potentially
change the ratio of happy/unhappy visitors. Happy visitors tend to offer
support and new ideas. They tend to explore the site more, read more, and
are more likely to bookmark.

What I have seen with themes is that support comments get split between the
theme owner's site and the theme database. That would cause an additional
workload for a plugin author.

I think a slightly different approach needs to be taken with the plugin site
interface. I am looking forward to using it  for some of my plugins, others
won't be able to because of licensing at present.

As long as it's GPL-compatible, which lots of licenses are, then it's no 
problem. People with commercially-licensed plugins can host them elsewhere.

themes.wordpress.net is a separate project on a separate domain, if you 
want to talk about it you should chat with Thomas.

The only theme thing I've written is this:

http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/

Which is pretty sparse.

No we can't.

We are "WP"-hackers; i.e. we hack the WordPress blogging platform.
http://wordpress.com/

If this person is a stalker, you call the police, not crack their email
passwords (btw, you hack _computers_, you *crack* passwords).

You sound like the stalker. This list is not for cracking passwords,
taking down websites, or anything like that. This is for development
of WordPress. Please take yourself somewhere else.

As for the real readers, we need not turn this into a "flame the idiot
for asking to learn to hack" thread again. Just leave it be, go on
with life.

Just because it's GPL-incompatible doesn't mean it's commercially  
licensed?

Given that this directory is going to stay aligned with wp-plugins.org,
are there any plans for enhancements to that environment?  I was
recently invited to participate in a wp plugin project set up on
code.google.com, where project owners can add other project members on
their own - a feature that's sadly lacking from wp-plugins.org.

I'm not saying that wp-plugins.org should strive to be another
code.google.com, and I'm very appreciative of the free hosting and
exposure wp-plugins.org provides, but being able to manage devs on your
project without emailing Matt would seem (to me) to be a worthwhile
enhancement.

More importantly, what about dual licensing?  I know of TONS of OSS projects

GPL/et.al. license.  Heck, isn't that how id licensed the Quake sources?

I'm on the verge of either dropping support of many of my plugins or needing 
to do commercial licenses for people with money-making (i.e., commercial) 
websites.  I'm glad WP is GPL, I'm fine with the fact that Matt has a 
company making money off this project (and offshoots, not all of which are 
open source...), but GPL doesn't work for me.  A dual-license scheme would 
potentially work, though admittedly I've never really looked into it.

I don't think your description reflects the licensing, or by
definition of OSS the projects you describe are not OSS. For example
mysql "commercial" licensing is for if GPL does not meet my (a user of
mysql) distribution needs (basically).

Depending on how your plugin interacts with WP core, all its licenses
would have to be GPL compatible, if you wish to distribute it.

Hope that helps,

Yes, that applies for most of the cases.  So someone wanting to publish a 
commercial product off of Q3 buys the closed-source commercial license. 
i.e., the original code owner can release the code in multiple manners. 
Though, there's also the case where a company will release a 'lite' version 
of their program/code as OSS, and have a 'pro' version that is 
closed-source.

But thanks for making that more clearly stated, as my original statement had 
it twisted around the wrong way. ;)

I have seen some of those threads, and there is less interpretation
and ambiguity than some people like to acknowledge. Is there a legal
imperative? No, because the harm is never likely to be significant
enough.

As someone trying to learn about WordPress with a view to using it as a
CMS for sites that may or may not have a blog component, 'Links' (as in
ver 2.0) seems a more appropriate title for the title of the admin page
that deals with links, with 'Blogroll' as a category of link that
appears by default on blog and blog related pages, and 'Bookmark' as
perhaps another category.

When the change in title was made to 2.1alpha, was there a post or
exchange on this list or elsewhere explaining the tentative change in
nomenclature?

The readme.txt spec for plugins hosted on wp-plugins.org is getting  
some fresh air blown into its lungs and will soon be given purpose.   
Everyone and their dog will want their plugin to have a readme.txt

So now seems like a good time to discuss the format and any  
improvements or clarifications that could be made.  Remember that the  
goal of this format is to be both human- and machine-readable.

Some of the new additions to the format:

* Minimum version (minimum version of WP that the plugin will work on)
* Tested with (maximum version of WP that the plugin has been tested on)
* Stable tag (for people who don't want /trunk/ to be regarded as  
stable, they can list a /tag/ that should take that role)

Here is a sample readme.txt

> === Plugin Name ===
> Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
> Contributors: username, username2, username3
> Minimum version: 2.0.3
> Tested with: 2.1
> Stable tag: 4.3

The idea is to use Markdown syntax for the individual sections, so  
consult http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax for that.

What else would be of use?  Do you see any ambiguities about the  
format that need to be resolved?

I could see the bad UI bit. I'm not sure what's needlessly
complicated. However, I think both plugins have poor UIs that don't
degrade well. So I'm -1 for either in the core, but if forced for one
or the other, well, you can guess my choice.

Pardon my skepticism, but people rarely comply with the accepted  
structure (blame sloppiness and/or misunderstandings). Free-form text  
is a route to problems, confusion and---consequently---support burden.  
One alternative would be to validate or autogenerate a file using, for  
example, a Web-based form on WordPress.org.

Another common practice for settings files is to embed structural  
information in them, using some delimiters, e.g. brackets. You  
otherwise have ambiguities, so the composer need to escape reserved  
sequences (which are not familiar/human-readable). Why not retain all  
this data in some machine-readable form and have some function in  
WordPress which interprets the file and generates, let us say, some  
nifty HTML to serve as a reference?

There is a certain similarity here between properly-constructed HTML  
markup and some 'fluid' output (e.g. WYSIWYG versus typesetting).  
Better start from fine milk to get cheese and whipped cream (milk  
products). It would be hard to convert cream into cheese... structural  
semantics and natural language (or document) don't have a symbiotic  
relationship.

Best wishes,

Roy

Less is more, I think - this looks like an awful lot of information
that some people (me!) wouldn't really want to fill out. Not trying to
knock it - just thought I should chime in. Also, I noticed that there
isn't really a way list the contributors with a bit more info.
Something that could include the email and url and support forum url
etc etc might be nice. I really feel like this could be done without
an additional readme.txt file, but I seem to recall having that
conversation on this list before.

RedAlt has been parsing these text files forever, and they look pretty 
reasonable to me.  (I'm not sure what's the intention with the mentioned 
markdown requirement though, since the rest of the site uses wiki syntax.)

The plugins listing there also provides the details for plugins directly 
from their header info, including Google-Juice-infused direct links to 
both the plugin site and the author site.

It makes every tagged version (including the trunk) available for 
download, and warns you when you try to get trunk (in-development) from 
a version that has published version tags.

It will display the readme version from the tag that you select, so if 
there have been documented changes, you can know it.

It will display plugin details for every plugin that's in the file, so 
if a project contains more than one plugin file, it shows them all.

You can see at a glance which authors bothered to include readme files, 
and which authors bother to tag their versions.

Like the page posted earlier with zip downloads, the RedAlt listing 
provides zip downloads of every trunk and tag for every plugin in the 
wp-plugins.org repo.

As of a few minutes ago, it supports substring multi-word searching 
within all readme files, headers, author names, plugin names, and urls.

It's possible that the moment that a new readme format is used, plugins 
that use those details will have them appear in the RedAlt listings.

It's also possible that there's a REST interface for the directory 
available.

You can find the RedAlt plugin mirror here:

Well, HTML is universally readable, directly publishable to the web (in a
WordPress post, even), and we could easily whip up a little microformat (ala
hCard) for plug-in metadata.

If this sounds interesting to anybody, I'll post an example.

Matt mentioned Markdown about 18 months ago when this readme.txt  
thing got started, so I was just going on that.  I do, however, like  
the idea of consolidating syntax... Markdown and the Trac wiki syntax  
are fairly close with some stuff.  What have people been using so far  
in most readme.txt files that you've been parsing?

Your implementation is very nice... I currently have two sets of  
rewrite rules (one commented, one not) in my .htaccess that I can use  
to point my plugin downloads to download.wordpress.org or your  
repository, depending on which of them is being funky on a given  
day. ;-)

And as Matt said, any code you'd be willing to share would be greatly  
appreciated, especially with regard to readme.txt and plugin parsing  
(same goes for you, Firas, if you're still listening and still have  
that code kicking around!)

Please not Trac's wiki syntax. Even the people that use WP's trac
hardly seem to know it (including myself). If you do choose a wiki
syntax mediawiki's is the most common, of course.

I don't see much difference between this readme.txt format and the
format used in the PHP comments at the beginning of a plugin file.

The existing plugin formatting seems to have worked well so far with no
problems, as far as I'm aware. What problems could possibly occur by
doing basically the same thing in a file with a new name?

This is just my experience, but I've welcomed the change from Links to
Blogroll. I know this sounds silly, but on my first encounter with
WordPress, when I saw the Links tab with the links in the list, I was
under the impression that you create a blog post and post a link
relevant to the blog post in the Links section. Now I know that you put
links in the actual post.

I know that's really n00by, but that was the impression I got from
"Links", even though I knew what "Blogroll" meant at that time.

Markdown is the most elegant text to HTML conversion system, and it's 
bi-directional. A well-formatted Markdown document is very readable as 
plain/text, which is why I originally chose it.

Whereas people coming at WordPress from other directions will be saying
"what?". Many people's links are just that - links to other sites, which are
not necessarily blogs. For confusion reduction, I would prefer "Links" (or
bookmarks even) for the general concept. "Blogroll" can be a category of
links, which would make sense for people who have different kinds of links.

The readme.txt spec for plugins hosted on wp-plugins.org is getting  
some fresh air blown into its lungs and will soon be given purpose.   
Everyone and their dog will want their plugin to have a readme.txt

So now seems like a good time to discuss the format and any  
improvements or clarifications that could be made.  Remember that the  
goal of this format is to be both human- and machine-readable.

Some of the new additions to the format:

* Minimum version (minimum version of WP that the plugin will work on)
* Tested with (maximum version of WP that the plugin has been tested on)
* Stable tag (for people who don't want /trunk/ to be regarded as  
stable, they can list a /tag/ that should take that role)

Here is a sample readme.txt

> === Plugin Name ===
> Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
> Contributors: username, username2, username3
> Minimum version: 2.0.3
> Tested with: 2.1
> Stable tag: 4.3
>
> Short description (250 words or fewer)  Regarding the above:

The idea is to use Markdown syntax for the individual sections, so  
consult http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax for that.

What else would be of use?  Do you see any ambiguities about the  
format that need to be resolved?

If it's Markdown-style (I'm still not clear on that point) then you
delimit the code with double backticks instead:

   `` This code contains literal `backticks`. ``

If your code uses double backticks, delimit with triples etc.

Even if that isn't possible, does it really matter? How often do you
*need* to embed code samples containing backticks in your plugin
readme files?

May I remind you of Murphy's law ;)
"If anything can go wrong, it will"

Personally I do use backticks. I can see where I might use backticks in FAQ's.

Message-ID: <122d4b4d0610251613m3f48abdag384c23c852e2df12@mail.gmail.com>

I'm building a site for a client and am using 2.1 alpha3, as the site won't
be live until close to the time that 2.1 is officially released (at least by
what I'm reading).

Anyway, I've tested 2 plugins so far to randomly pull a post from a category
(coffee2code's customizable post listings as well as another one I found via
google).

Anyway, both are kicking out a mysql error:

> WHERE .post_date <= '2006-10-25 19:04:47' AND ( .post_status = ]
> SELECT DISTINCT * FROM WHERE .post_date <= '2006-10-25 19:04:47' AND (

I'm guessing there's some new way posts are referenced in the database, and
these plugins are improperly referencing the database.  Any suggestions on
where to look to properly call the new schema?

If this is a tester's list  question, forgive me,  I've not really
tinkered  with  advanced copies of  WP  before.

Those plugins are using the deprecated $table_prefix instead of 
$wpdb->prefix.

Oops. I meant it's using $tableposts instead of $wpdb->posts.

Thanks Ryan for the quick reply.  Indeed coffee2code's plugin does use the
$tableposts, however the second plugin I found
http://www.screenflicker.com/blog/web-development/wordpress-plugin-random-categories-with-random-posts/
makes no reference to the  $tablesposts

I'll say up front I have not much  background in such, so if  it's  case of
completely rewriting  a plugin,  I may have to wait... however I'm game to
muddle my way through if  anyone has some insight or suggestions.

OK.  Seems I had some issues with my FTP client, and the changes didn't
stick.  The second plugin seems to be working, albeit I may need to
customize it to get the actual post to show.

Sorry to bother.

+1 for links (or bookmarks), -1 for blogroll.
Blogroll for me are links to the latest n posts from people whose
blogs I subscribe -- a rolling list of blogs.

Blogroll means both too many things to some and nothing to others; and
is also just a furthering of the tacky verbifying of the buzzword
'blog'. (which, years later, still sounds too much like bog -- slang
for excrement)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Loosening username restrictions in plugin?
Message-ID: <9FC8C637-6698-49D7-A2F6-3D49B2B9A969@verselogic.net>

I'm working on a plugin (wpopenid) that does user registration. I  
want to permit urls in the username slug (or most of a url, this is a  
vanity issue).

In wp_insert_user(), sanitize_user( $username, true ) is called,  
which strips all sorts of interesting characters from the name, under  
the claim "If strict, reduce to ASCII for max portability". Is there  
a compulsive reason to avoid relaxing this restriction to  
sanitize_user( $username, false )?

If not, I'm planning on making a recursive call to sanitize_user() ala:

sanitize_user() calls
 > return apply_filters('sanitize_user', $username, $raw_username,  
$strict);

add_filter('sanitize_user', 'destrict_username', 2, 3);
function destruct_username( $username, $raw_username, $strict ) {
	if( $strict && $some_flag_in_my_plugin ) return sanitize_user 
( $raw_username, false )
	return $username;
}

Does anyone see a problem with this train of thought?

Heya!
Blog as short for weblog is fine with me and a well known concept by now 
( no crap :)
In my opinion "Links" is to prefer over "Blogroll" as the overall concept,
as links could link to anything, even a coffee machine.

I am convinced though, that links should have categories,
and that one of the predefined categories should be "Blogroll",
as this is also very well known to bloggers.

For newbies much of what you can do with your blog is unknown,
and to use all features of a blogging platform, they'll have to learn, 
what it all means.

When I started, some things confused me ( some still do ;).
What's a feed? RSS? Atom? Ping back? etc.
Now we even have widgets - oh my!

I could be wrong too, but I think he wants to support URIs that would let people use their OpenID to log in (which would be super-cool).

A typical OpenID URI:  alice.openid-provider.org

OK, that seems about on-par with my current stats (a daily 40-70k w/o
slashdot or digg, with them it jumps up to about 200k)

But that's what worries me most.. NeoSmart Technologies makes
Digg/Slashdot/OSnews/OSDir/any other big news site quite often and
that's what hurts.

My problem isn't with the PHP as much as it is with the MySQL: My php
runs great, it's just the SQL that times out and drives my site to the
ground. That was on a VPS, now I'm going to a dedicated Windows 2003
EE server... Do you think eAccelerator + some MySQL tweaking + newer
versions of PHP & MySQL will be enough???

I guess I can try it first, see what happens, and if that fails go to phalanger.

Thanks!

I think you just need two boxes if you're getting that kinda traffic. It
does wonders when one handles MySQL and one handles file serving. Hell, I
even run a third box to serve up static files like images and CSS files.

Either that, consider redirecting people to coralized version of your site
might be needed during Digg times:

I agree 100%.  I've commented on this before, in the ticket perhaps, and
said exactly the same thing.  I don't really use my links as a blog roll.  I
mostly link to non-blogs.  Now, I am smart enough to ignore the name and do
what I want with it regardless of what the screen says, but as a new
blogger, I did not know what a blog roll was but I sure knew what links
were.

Or add an option to change these things to whatever you want. Seems like
this kind of thing is nearly impossible to resolve adequately b/c such large
groups of people fall on one side of the coin or the other or the other

I think the issue with this is the fact that links/bookmarks/blogroll is
being rolled into the same category structure as post categories, so some
earmark must be set to define the specific default category for
links/bookmarks/blogroll.
I agree that being able to change the category title would be best, much
like uncategorized can be changed now, even if it stays the default cat if a
containing cat is deleted.

While on the subject, is there any documentation started to outline the new
template tags for the structure, or will all  the existing tags work the
same?

It is certainly not an end-of-the-world issue.  I'm less concerned about
what all of the tech gurus think.  We all can adjust to it whatever it is
called.  I'm just concerned with giving the newbie the easiest transition
into blogging. I'll certainly admit that perhaps I am too technical to
evaluate whether a highschooler or perhaps some veterinarian in Oshkosh
starting their first blog will know what a link is as compared to knowing
what a blogroll is.

That's exactly what I wanted to do. However, this idea plays havoc with 
the Author template's fancy urls. In particular, I don't think it likes 
extra slashes in the url. Not the greatest idea ever.

Yes, but done correctly, this should be PURELY and implementation detail.
It's the fact that features are being added and changed that is causing the
confusion. If a field was added to the category table that declared each
category as a link category or as a post category, the interface would have
remained the same.  So dropping the redundant table was not the issue and
multipurpose categories really should be talked about as a separate feature.

You'll have to make extra sure that your cookie's scope is set correctly too
or you'll have one cookie for user.example.com and one for the straight
example.com.  Depending upon what else you track and the different ways the
users reach this site, you may or may not want separate cookies on the
client's machine.

Something to think about...

Anybody who's used the web will understand the concept of a "link".

"Blogroll" is a part of an argot that, arguably, no newbies will understand.
Plus, it's not like you can only use it to link to blogs.

the template can just use a sanitized (and unique) version of the uri, or 
other (site unique) chosen shortname.  should be similar (in concept) to 
generating a unique post name from the post title for fancy urls...

Prompts me to ask, too: Should rawurlencode or urlencode be used?

An observation about blogroll...can't some nomenclature remain for

I don't understand anyone to say that the term "blogroll" should not
continue to be used as it is in version 2. 

>From my perspective, at least, the discussion is about what to call the
admin panel on which links or bookmarks or blogroll entries are managed.


As I understand the term, a blogroll is list of links to other blogs.
WordPress can and is used for blogs and other sites that have lists of
links that are not links to blogs. The ability to categorize
links/bookmarks/blogroll_entries enhances the software's capabilities in
that regard. What I and others are saying is that 'Blogroll' is too
narrow a description for what the Links panel manages, or can manage.
Even for someone who understands both terms, the use of Blogroll may be
confusing to those who want to include and manage other kinds of links.
"Where," they might ask, "is the 'Other Links' panel?"

That having been said, I guess the final version will reflect the main
developers' vision of the product. Since wordpress.com is calling the
Links panel 'Blogroll', perhaps the best we can hope for is that the
release version of 2.1 will have a built in option to name the panel
'Links' as it is in version 2.

I like "Links" -- doesn't limit to a specific use.

I support the idea of organizing links as links and allowing user to name
the list of links on sidebar. So, a blogger can have "Blogroll" on the
sidebar (by default), while others can edit the sidebar.php and change the
list title to "Links" or "Resources" or whatever. This is similar to the way
for listing pages on sidebar.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP Mod_Rewrite Explanation
Message-ID: <000901c6fa07$c224e230$466ea690$@net>

I've been looking for a freeware open source (GPL) alternative to
Mod_Rewrite for IIS, and I've found something that'll work with some
hacking.

It works OK, but it's quirky, I was looking for an explanation for this:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /blog/index.php [L]

The last line: what exactly is it?
Is it the same as
(.*)$ /blog/index.php/$1 [L]

The way I see it, it says "Redirect all requests to index.php"

But then how does index.php have any idea what was called? Is it using
Request_URI in there (ugh!)?

If so, I'll need more hacking than I thought....

I really, REALLY have begun to regret the term "blog" being pre- and
ap- pended to words - it just sounds so, well, 2001(the year, not the
movie)-ish. I would heartily advocate for the reinstation of "Links".

I just think it is funny because it is an obvious pun on the Brittish term
Bog-Roll (aka Roll of toilet paper).  And I don't think most people in the
U.S. get it.  In American slang, it's the same thing as your Sh* list, which
I could see people calling it.  I do NOT recommend that as a compromise.

WordPress has an internal rewriter... so yeah, it directs all  
requests to index.php and figures it all out from the actually  
requested URL.  We used to have both mod_rewrite rewriting and  
internal rewriting for PATHINFO permalinks, but there were  
inconsistencies in behavior.  Moving to the internal rewriter has  
really been a big help.

Well, it looks like 2.0.5 came out without a pre-announcement...

Is there an RSS feed or something that I can subscribe to to get advance
notice? Can this be solved with AJAX or something? :)

No pre-announcement? What? Ryan posted yesterday:

2.0.5 is looking tight and outtasight.  I think we're ready for release.

No objections were posted, and thus it was released as planned. Also, the
release has been geared-up to for at least a couple of weeks now.

It was posted to wp-testers:

 http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers

Nothing was posted here.

It'd be nice if release notices were cross-posted. Plugin developers
only really need to know about release candidates, so everything else
on -testers is noise.

I disagree. Testers has a lot of information in and out on the state
of plugins, things that work with newer versions, problems with
plugins breaking, etc. Developers should be subscribed to both.

Not everyone has the time to live and breathe WordPress. Testing often
consists of installing plugins with the new version and praying that
nothing breaks. Judging by the the number of complaints about broken
plugins every time there's a release, a lot of people work this way.
;)

I realize we'll be first against the wall when the revolution comes, but still.

Would it have helped if the release date had been adjusted back from the
31st?  That's why I was surprised by this...

I would have finished my new automatic update script instead of watching
Survivor and Torchwood, if the release date had been changed sometime
yesterday or today to show it might be released before Tuesday.  I
figured I'd at least have tomorrow morning to put it together given the
release date hadn't changed.  I'd wanted to have it and on more article
ready for the release.

Not a huge deal, but people, me at least, look at that date and are used
to release dates meaning something.

Also, Congrats Ryan!  I'd missed the news.  The first baby is always
exciting... Welcome to the parenthood club!

He does have a point. If you just want to know about RC's or releases, that
may be useful for plugins. However, browsing the wp-testers archives (
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2006-October/thread.html,
etc), there's a lot of other stuff that would be relevant to only testers.
Maybe a wp-announce list?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Code Tag Driving me Nuts!!
Message-ID: <000601c6fac8$fde081f0$f9a185d0$@net>

Is the <code></code> tag supposed to (in WP) display whatever is in between
it tit-for-tat or is it supposed to parse the HTML within?

It's driving me _nuts_!
I'm trying to put up a post that has more code than normal text, and I just
can't for the life of me figure out how to get my stuff to display right!
If I put un-encoded HTML straight into the <code> tags, it'll display OK in
WP, but it'll completely screw up my other apps that use the WP database.

http://neosmart.ath.cx/codesample.html

That's how normal HTML is treated: you put _encoded_ html in the <Code> tags
just as you would anywhere else' and it get's parsed.

With WP if you put encoded HTML it displays as-is; as if a <pre> tag was
applied to the box _which isn't right_.

It seems near impossible to get code to work right... why is it built this
way? I can't see any benefit to using "pre" tags for code boxes unless
explicitly specified.

I thought this plugin
(http://www.coffee2code.com/archives/2005/03/29/plugin-preserve-code-formatt
ing/) would help, but it didn't; and the codex on this topic is absolutely
of no use: http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Code_in_Your_Posts

Owen Winkler's "Code Filter" plugin might be what I'm looking for - but it's
gone now with the rest of his data after the server crash a couple of months
ago.


Everything I read says: "Escape your HTML in code tags in WP"
Yet when I do that it displays them as-is... driving me nuts.

Please someone explain this nightmare!

Message-ID: <001401c6facf$58195fb0$c864a8c0@tiger1>

I've been monitoring this release for problems people have had in their
conversions and encouraging them to get everyone in their blog roll to
update - especially those with versions 2.0.2 and older.  

I thought a central place to report "incedents" might be useful.  So,
I'm wasting a few electrons and starting a thread - Two I guess since it
is cross-posted to Testers & Hackers.

I've checked around 60 sites so far and I've seen two issues.  One was
with a homemade plugin including a file that was now included through
another method.  The other issue as this one:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/92183

Many pages in WordPress (specially the ones where you are posting forms)
are ending op this a page with this page:

--------------------
In Firefox:
====================
302 Found
The document has moved here.

Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while
trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
--------------------

--------------------
In Internet Explorer
====================
Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage 

Most likely causes:
- You are not connected to the Internet.
- The website is encountering problems.
- There might be a typing error in the address.
--------------------


Similar issues were reported here:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3190

I found it referenced here:
http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/10/28/wordpress-205-released/  by
Martin Daugaard http://www.stevnhoved.dk/

He's fixed it with "a tiny hack". I've asked for more info.

I'll keep moving through the (English speaking) sites as the day goes
on.

If you save a post as a draft and continue it later, isn't it logical that
when you "continue" writing and then "save and continue" the time-stamp
should be updated?

May I ask what the logic is behind the current system which sticks to the
very first "save-date" for publication time-stamps?

In the ticket you write, that there are functions from class-IXR.php which
are decoding the data. I can't see something like this, can you "open my
eyes" please?

I still think the xmlrpc-metaweblog-functions should act like in the
"official" api-doc written and this is: "[..]bits is a base64-encoded binary
value containing the content of the object.[..]"

If you are having issues with image upload over xml-rpc I would try

I don't think this is a problem with Plugins, because the clients send their
data direct to http://blogname/xmlrpc.php i think. So there is no hook,
where a plugin can interact. My written client is using this adress too.

It's not clear, but you may be trying to use the code tag as a CDATA 
section. That's not it's purpose. All the code element is supposed to do 
is mark a section as code, which usually means monospacing it. That's it.

If it's not doing that, or it's doing more than that, then this is a bug.

If you expect it to do something beyond that, then the bug is yours. 
Please elaborate. i.e. what do you put in? what do you get? what do you 
expect?

Without testing it, out of my sleepy hat, I'd propose that you use 
escaped code within a <pre> tag to preserve formatting.
For styling I'd use <pre class="code">some code here</pre> and a CSS 
rule for .code.

That should work I guess. ( hopefully my "tags" above doesn't break 
anything ;)

Well, I think this is a good thing. The first publishing date should stick.
Only if it were a versioning system, updated dates should be added. It 
isn't though.

Rational: On a happy Sunday in April 2005, I lament about my visit to a 
great rock consert.
A year later I read through my posts and find that I misspelled the name 
of the arena,
and I do an edit to correct this.
If the publishing date is changed, I'll suddenly move the concert in 
time by a year,
and my readers are confused.

However if you want to cheat and change the published date, you can do 
so explicitly in WP
You're in charge after all.

*Published* dates should not change, yes. *Draft* dates should update when
published, IMHO

It'd be semantically better to use <pre><code>[escaped HTML]</code></ 
pre> then use a CSS rule for pre code (if not pre > code). pre has a  
semantic meaning of "whitespace within this element has meaning", and  
code has a semantic meaning of "there is computer code within this  
element". Therefore, you should be using pre and code for code where  
whitespace has meaning.

As Les said - you *published* it - so yeah.
But when I _post as a draft_ that's a far cry from publishing.

I do my drafting offline, so I never noticed, except yesterday I posted a
"drafted" page that was a year old - that's when it hit me. I never
"published" always saved as a draft.

Post date should be the date of the first "Publish" command. Not first save.

I figured it out, sorry for the bother.

It turns out that all 8 code-rendering plugins I had installed were somehow borked in one of the more recent builds.

My code tag was

<code lang="html">&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;<br />&hellip;<br />&lt;link rel="Stylesheet" href="http://neosmart.net/dynamicCSS.php" type="text/css" media="Screen" /&gt;&lt;/head&gt;.</code>

As an example. Everything within is encoding - i.e. removing the code tag displays it *exactly* as it should.

Instead, it would show this in a "code box" (as my CSS defined it) in the post:
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;<br />&hellip;<br />&lt;link rel="Stylesheet" href="http://neosmart.net/dynamicCSS.php" type="text/css" media="Screen" /&gt;&lt;/head&gt;.

It was encoding the already encoded HTML.

The broken plugin(s) would go haywire with the presence of the "lang" tag within the code tag. That's what they required in 2.0, but for some reason 2.1 broke it.

Not exactly a bug, not exactly problem with WP - just drove me nuts is all :)

(removing the lang="html" bit fixed it).

If I use eAccelerator, is there any benefit to WP-Cache? What about the

Me too - or me neither. Never got anything from that list. This is how
most projects seem to handle announcing releases (*-announce lists),
and it helps keep the whining down from the part-timers and lurkers
who aren't deeply involved in the project (like me!), but keeps one in
the loop for important developments (new releases, security updates,
etc.)

eAccelerator saves PHP compile time on every load.  WP-Cache saves  
compile + query + process time on cached hits.  WP object cache  
(depending on hard drive speed) saves query + query processing time.

They can all be of benefit... one cannot cover the other.

Can you reproduce a situation where this is NOT the case?

1. Type a draft and save and continue editing at 1:35pm
2. Wait until 1:36pm
3. Publish
4. Post published at 1:36pm

Absolutely! The "Save as draft" date is of no relevence.
"First publish" date should prevail.
Do you say it doesn't?

If so, something is certainly strange.

Generally does for me, too.

However, when I use Performancing (http://performancing.com/firefox), which
I have set to "post as draft", then go to WP to finish the post, the
timestamp doesn't get updated when I publish. This behaviour is consistent,
if unexpected.

I've noticed for a while that all my comments on WordPress blogs with  
Akismet get filtered (even on my own blog!!!) Mow I tried posting on  
WordPress forums and noticed my posts are visible only to me, and i I  
log out they disappear. Did I get blacklisted somehow? Is it my IP?  
Name (LobsterMan)? email address (rjk18@hotpop.com)? what an I doing  
wrong (or not) and how can I fix this?

Correction: My case is same as Les'

I use BlogJet, post as draft, then copy and paste updated code.
First save-as-draft date prevails.

My guess would be there is something wrong with the XML-RPC client and the
way it handles post/draft requests maybe?

I just tried a non-remote draft-then-publish, and it works as expected.
It's only when using remote blogging tools that this happens I guess....

Oxymoronic or not, "On-the-fly compilation" could be discussed.
There is in a way such things as "compile time compilation" and "run 
time compilation".

For example Java Server Pages are compiled into Java Servlets the first 
time you request the page.
This is maybe not really "run time", as the developer is the one to test 
the JSP first.

Java source code is compiled at "compile time" into the binary class 
record format.
The Java run time engine however, will compile the classes into machine 
code for the host machine at run time,
i.e. on-the-fly. If it is lazy ( aka effective ) it will only compile 
code as needed, bottlenecks first.
The compiled code will be cached in memory only and last for the current 
session.

Just couldn't resist ;)

Post on your own site, unmark it as spam.  Repeat. Teach akismet you
aren't evil.  That said, if too many other people think you are a
spammer... you are out of luck.

Are you sure Akismet can be taught? Can this be something that spammers can
abuse because if these spammers create tons of spam blogs and comments on
each others blogs, unmark them as spam, Akistmet might think they're not
spam.

Kates,

I have written on the subject twice.  I think Akismet is a great service,
and applaud its creators.  But because it is a black box, there is no
recourse to being labeled a spammer.  I really did teach Akismet I was a
good guy.

Since I wrote those posts, I believe Akismet has gotten much better.

Just thought I'd point out something:
You don't even need to create a blog nor do you need to post an actual
comment to "communicate" with Akismet.

All you need is a akismet ID, and a 10-liner PHP script.
In 10 minutes I could write a script that reads a list of spammer's emails
from a flat-file or the database, and submit each and every name to akismet
as legit - unless it's changed since the last time I'd looked at it.

Gah! - Hate to double-post, but here goes:

You must realize that the email blacklist or domain blacklists for the
username field are only a small part of Akismet's workings. Not having the
fortune to _be_ Matt, I can't tell you the exact recipe ;)

But I can tell you that in my experience the _content_ of a message is more
important than the actual domain or email address: most spam sites spring up
overnight, and their email addresses are usually @legitdomains.com - domain
spoofing.

At a guess - I'd say something about you has been _manually_ spanked as
"evil" and blacklisted - that's why bringing attention to it gets akismet
"taught," but then again, I don't really know.

Hi Joe,

The best thing to do is use the form at http://akismet.com/contact/
and someone will get back to you about your issue.

Yes I figure the content is important, but in my case, whatever I  
write gets caught. And believe me, I'm no spammer.

Should we remove the octet-encoding when sanitizing slugs?  We'd still 
need to support old, encoded slugs, but new slugs can forego the 
%cf%de%... stuff.  Do all of the major browsers support unencoded UTF-8 
characters? Thoughts?  Code?

We do follow the spec...

In xmlrpc.php (http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/xmlrpc.php) we
define a new class:

class wp_xmlrpc_server extends IXR_Server {
	function wp_xmlrpc_server() {

And then instatiate it thereby executing it's constructor:
$wp_xmlrpc_server = new wp_xmlrpc_server();

This is turn calls the constuctor of the base class:
$this->IXR_Server($this->methods);


In the base class constructor from
(http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/class-IXR.php):

    function IXR_Server($callbacks = false, $data = false) {
        ...
        $this->serve($data);
    }
    function serve($data = false) {
        ...
        $this->message = new IXR_Message($data);
        if (!$this->message->parse()) {

The IXR_Mesage class parsing code handles the base64 encoded field as
follows:

    function tag_close($parser, $tag) {
        $valueFlag = false;
        switch($tag) {
	    ...
            case 'base64':
                $value = base64_decode( trim( $this->_currentTagContents
) );
                $valueFlag = true;
                break;

This is where the base64_decode occurs.

Yes the call into xmlrpc.php but this then calls interal WordPress API
functions which have hooks in for plugins.

For example for image upload (in 2.1) mw_newMediaObject calls
wp_upload_bits
(http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/functions.php)
which calls wp_check_filetype which has the 'upload_mimes' filter for
modifying supported file types.

Your will also find all the "normal" hooks like "plugins_loaded" and
"init" will run as wp-config.php and hence wp-settings.php are pulled in.

One of those things where I tend to only half-understand the Mozilla
bugs, but what browsers do differs between the path and the query
string, so you can expect different handling for example.com/r?sum?/
than you get for example.com/index.php?page=r?sum?

What about proxy servers and the like?

I thought true URI's in the RFC sense could only be 7bit

I think most modern browsers support displaying the encoded strings as
UTF8 rather than %encoded but over the wire they still send the %encoded
string.

Checking this with FF gives that impression.

Plus, if a new release is fixing security issues it is very important to
notify blog owners, otherwise they could not know about the issue for a
number of months.

You can't expect "normal" blog-admins to stay subscribed to a
high-traffic list like wp-hackers to just listen out for the
once-every-few-months email announcing the new release.

Message-ID: <b95685d80610301757u64b6343dyba92ba16f342fbd6@mail.gmail.com>

I originally posted this one at the support forums of wordpress and  *
spencerp <http://www.vindictivebastard.net/> *told** me that I can ask
here...

So here it is....

Hello, I add some lines at the function
wp_insert_comment()(/wp-includes/comment-
functions.php)

the original code was

function wp_insert_comment($commentdata) {
global $wpdb;
extract($commentdata);
if ( ! isset($comment_author_IP) )
$comment_author_IP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
if ( ! isset($comment_date) )
$comment_date = current_time('mysql');
if ( ! isset($comment_date_gmt) )
$comment_date_gmt = gmdate('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime($comment_date) );
if ( ! isset($comment_parent) )
$comment_parent = 0;
if ( ! isset($comment_approved) )
$comment_approved = 1;
$result = $wpdb->query("INSERT INTO $wpdb->comments
(comment_post_ID, comment_author, comment_author_email, comment_author_url,
comment_author_IP, comment_date, comment_date_gmt, comment_content,
comment_approved, comment_agent, comment_type, comment_parent, user_id)
VALUES
('$comment_post_ID', '$comment_author', '$comment_author_email',
'$comment_author_url', '$comment_author_IP', '$comment_date',
'$comment_date_gmt', '$comment_content', '$comment_approved',
'$comment_agent', '$comment_type', '$comment_parent', '$user_id')
");
$id = $wpdb->insert_id;
if ( $comment_approved == 1) {
$count = $wpdb->get_var("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM $wpdb->comments WHERE
comment_post_ID = '$comment_post_ID' AND comment_approved = '1'");
$wpdb->query( "UPDATE $wpdb->posts SET comment_count = $count WHERE ID =
'$comment_post_ID'" );
}
return $id;
}

and here is the edited one

function wp_insert_comment($commentdata) {
global $wpdb;
extract($commentdata);
if ( ! isset($comment_author_IP) )
$comment_author_IP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
if ( ! isset($comment_date) )
$comment_date = current_time('mysql');
if ( ! isset($comment_date_gmt) )
$comment_date_gmt = gmdate('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime($comment_date) );
if ( ! isset($comment_parent) )
$comment_parent = 0;
if ( ! isset($comment_approved) )
$comment_approved = 1;
if ($comment_post_ID == '32' or $comment_post_ID == '84')
$comment_approved = 0;
$result = $wpdb->query("INSERT INTO $wpdb->comments
(comment_post_ID, comment_author, comment_author_email, comment_author_url,
comment_author_IP, comment_date, comment_date_gmt, comment_content,
comment_approved, comment_agent, comment_type, comment_parent, user_id)
VALUES
('$comment_post_ID', '$comment_author', '$comment_author_email',
'$comment_author_url', '$comment_author_IP', '$comment_date',
'$comment_date_gmt', '$comment_content', '$comment_approved',
'$comment_agent', '$comment_type', '$comment_parent', '$user_id')
");
$id = $wpdb->insert_id;
if ( $comment_approved == 1) {
$count = $wpdb->get_var("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM $wpdb->comments WHERE
comment_post_ID = '$comment_post_ID' AND comment_approved = '1'");
$wpdb->query( "UPDATE $wpdb->posts SET comment_count = $count WHERE ID =
'$comment_post_ID'" );
}
return $id;
}

(I added these lines: if ($comment_post_ID == '32' or $comment_post_ID ==
'84')
$comment_approved = 0;)

Now, I just want to ask if this will generate bugs. You see, I want all
comments that would be posted with the post number 32 or 84 undergo comment
moderation. Thanks!

Is this going to create problems with MySQL? (Especially if the goal
is still to support 3.23?) I haven't investigated; it's just a
thought.

It's easier to percent-encode any UTF-8 query vars when they come in,
and keep everything as a URI in the database. Isn't that what's
already being done? The permalink functions can always decode them
back to UTF-8 for display. Support both, in other words.

There are bound to be problems with people using non-UTF-8 charsets,
though, since they'd presumably need the %encoded form. At the very
least, the browser support isn't 100% in that situation. [1]

Better to use a plugin than to modify core. Maybe the pre_comment_approved filter, here's an 
(untested) suggestion.

function always_moderate_comments( $approved ) {
   global $commentdata;
   $forposts = array( 32, 84 );
   if( in_array( $commentdata['comment_post_ID'], $forposts ) ) return 0;
   return $approved;
}
add_filter( 'pre_comment_approved', 'always_moderate_comments' );

DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO POST THIS KIND OF STUFF
HERE????????????
ASKING QUESTIONS WITH YOUR FIRST POST AND ALL THAT!?!?!?

Well, yeah, it works for me... Welcome!

(And this joke would have worked better if I hadn't fallen asleep while
writing this email last night and Alan hadn't replied first...  Anyway, I'm
saying basically the same thing he is. So we must be on the right track.  I
just chose a different place to hook in.  I think mine is better since it
allows you to respect Akismet or not at your discretion. (I've not fully
tested that feature btw.) So, now back to the original email already in
progress...)

I don't see anything wrong at all with your code, but I'd rather see this as
a plugin instead of a hack of code...  You'll thank yourself later when an
update does not wipe out this "feature" because it is just a plugin.  If I
were to make this a full fledged plugin, I would toss in an edit field and
allow the posts to be entered in a config screen and separated by commas.
Maybe I'll do that tomorrow night...  

Here's the code as is....  Just save it as "TCC_ModeratedPosts.php" in your
plugin directory (Please keep the uppercase letters.) and activate it.  

(I've now tested this and it works fine and doesn't interfere with posts on
other comments.)

Enjoy! (scroll down for the code - don't forget to snip off any signature
the mailing lists adds before you safe this as a php file.)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Integrating a form in a page template
Message-ID: <9A322F1A-AA3D-4430-820B-560511B9E1AE@gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm trying to integrate a contact form into one of my sites by  
creating a page template with the form in it. i set the 'action' to <? 
php echo $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];  ?> and then to <?php echo  
get_permalink(); ?> though they both give the same address, except  
that the $_SERVER one is relative. anyways, when I submit the form,  
(at the same page!) I get a WordPress 404, even though it shows the  
permalink of a valid page in the browser, (and if i hit enter, it  
takes me to that page)

Please don't try suggesting I use a plugin, I have my reasons for not  
using them, mainly the lack of flexibility, and the css block forced  
into every page. The code i'm using was tested and is fully  
functional on a plain php page.

Anyone know what's going on?
