I've got the reply from Nigel, the GeSHi Developer. Here's what he says:

  |  I released a fix for the bug mere hours after it was posted there, 
and
  |  before secunia got hold of it.
  |
  |  It's those people at postnuke... the reason why this was a problem 
is
  |  because they included GeSHi completely, without bothering to check
  |  that the docs/ and contrib/ directories aren't actually needed.
  |
  |  Well, the bug means that if you have example.php web-facing, the
  |  hacker can view any file on your server.
  |
  |  But there is no such malicious code in the core. There is an 
include
  |  that happens in the core, but it is already sanatised (it's the
  |  include that is done when set_language is called, which is always 
done
  |  if you want coloured highlighting).

so that should allay any concerns regarding security that anyone may 
have by using
iG:Syntax Hiliter. I can't vouch for other plugins though, so to just be 
on safe, those using
any other plugins which use GeSHi, they should make sure that the 
'contrib' directory
of GeSHi shouldn't be on their server.

Threads, as those mentioned in the first reply to this e-mail thread,
concerning favorite PHP editor have been floating around on the WordPress
forums since the dawn of time.

Summary: Crimson Editor for windows, BBEdit for MacOSX, vim/nano for
linux/unix. I personally use CE on windows and when I'm ssh'd into my gentoo
server at home I use nano.

And yes, this IS off-topic. It would've been better to search the forums
where you would've found your answers.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Multiple Admins in 1.5
Message-ID: <20051003171250.11183.qmail@web31802.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I've been trying to figure out a way to give 2 users
full "admin" access to some Wordpress (1.5) installs
I've got going, and I haven't been able to find an
easy/clean way. 

One almost-fix is to change the users -> user_level to
10 in the database directly. Then, this user can edit
all Posts, but they still can't see any Pages created
by other users. They can edit them via "edit this
page" links on the blog, but not via Manage -> Pages.
The problem there seems to be that users can't edit
those Pages made by users at their same user_level. 

The basic question - is there a way to give 2 users
access to all Pages - even those they didn't author
(without hacking the source, or accessing the database
directly).

Here's some support links about this: 

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/3083
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/24042
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/37993
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/38974
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/13024

This seems to be "fixed" in SVN - the Administrator
role allows you to see other's Pages -  but I'm
wondering if anyone knows of a solution for 1.5
without hacking the source.

Message-ID: <4344366E.8030909@midnightcircus.com>

I was looking for a plugin hook that would allow me to inject the 
query_vars with a value or two before the default posts array is 
generated.  That's when I came upon this:

if ( !empty($query) ) {
	do_action('parse_query', array(&$this));
}

Why does $query have to be empty to fire this hook?  There seems to be 
no other way to modify the query_vars on the home page from a plugin.

Surely that says *not* empty. I.e only call the hook if there is a
query to process.

Er...  Let's try that again...

Why does $query have to be NON-empty to fire this hook?  There seems to 
be no other way to modify the query_vars on the home page from a plugin.

Put a different way:  If the request is for the home page ($query == '') 
then the hook isn't fired.

Attached is my proposed, possibly easier-to-manage solution.

Well, giving an empty query is a way of saying, "Don't reset the
internal query, just do a run through of what's already set in case
something changed behind the scenes."  We don't do the action if this is
the case because we're trying to be sneaky.  Plus, we want to avoid
recursion in the case where some calls parse_query() from the
parse_query action. is_home is a corner case, alas.  Maybe we could test
if ($query === false).  I don't know if any plugins are actually using
this behavior, so we might be able to change or drop it.

You can use the query_vars filter, but anything stuck in there will affect the is_* states.
That's probably not what you want.

Sounds good.  Write a bug, please, and I will commit.

/products/product1/
/products/product1/color1
/products/product1/color2
/products/product2/
/products/product2/color2
/products/product2/color3

However, as you probably know, Wordpress chokes when the slugs are the 
same, even if they are children of separate pages.  I had to work around 
this problem somehow, and this isn't the cleanest way but it works.  I 
just add an extra db query to find the proper post ID, based on each 
parent.  I've attached the patch output in case anyone wants to use this.

wordpress-working/wp-includes/classes.php > wp-1.5.2-subpage-same-slug.patch

Cheers,

Mike

Try these patches on 1.6.

Instead of adding to the existing posts query, I have 
update_category_cache() build $cache_category->fullpath which contains 
the full path of the category and its parents.  Then when a category is 
requested, it looks for the full path among the $cache_category array. 
If it can't find it, it looks for the last directory in the path.

These patches reduce the potential number of queries used by 1.

Please *test*.

Well it looks like the same thing can be done with update_page_cache() 
(note for my application, I need subpages w/ matching slugs rather than 
categories); however, update_page_cache() is only called from 
wp_list_pages(), which hasn't normally been processed at the time 
get_posts() was called.  Not sure if it makes sense to call get_pages() 
for every page load, so I'm going to stick with the extra query in 
get_posts() for now.. any thoughts on this?

It seems I totally misread your email.  :)

But you're right, you could probably do something similar with 
update_page_cache();

I haven't looked specifically at the ramifications of this, but why not 
call update_page_cache() from get_posts() when $q['page_name'] is set? 
It might not be as direct, but it should have two benefits:

1) Compartmentalize the aggregation of page fullpaths.
2) Allow those page fullpaths to be accessed by other code after the 
cache is loaded.

Just a thought.

In any case, sorry for the misread.  The category stuff should still 
work, if anyone else is interested in reviewing it.  Maybe I'll just 
submit the patch to Trac.

This thread goes way back to April, but I am catching up on the  
hackers list (only 2331 more emails to read, not bad considering I  
started with over 6000 :)

Anyway, there may have been a solution posited later on that I  
haven't reached yet, but if not, here's my input (as I am currently  
struggling with my own plugin Live+Press as well as 3rd party plugins)

I think the solution isn't to try and automagically guess what may or  
may not be the valid and correct markup and CSS for the theme but  
rather to make a nice configuration setup so the user can input the  
right information manually. Yeah, I know, that's not a "user  
friendly" solution, but it is the only viable one. It is too easy for  
a user to create a bizarre layout or to not include something or  
whatever to bork the lookup tables.

If you really want automagical plugin output, you could parse the  
active theme or somesuch when the configuration page loads. To be  
perfectly honest, and I am leaning in this direction with Live+Press,  
it might also be good to make clean, output with no markup, or at  
least output functions that can take variables for input.

My layouts are messed up because of bad plugin output (my own  
included) and are nearly impossible to style correctly.

Which also reminds me, plugin developers should be careful when  
puking CSS directly into the html file. It is MUCH better imo (again,  
changes to Live+Press are in order, so I am an offender here as well)  
to simply tell users to add the appropriate css link or import  
directive to their templates. The big problem with all of the  
automatic CSS imbeds from plugins is that plugin a can stomp over  
plugin b's CSS and then the layout is unfixable.

This may or may not be a bright idea, which is why I'm sending it
'round. WP might be sped up by reducing the number of includes and/or
leaving big functions out of the core. Here's a possibililty:

--- begin wp-functions.php
<?php
// Functions and the files that declare them, next on Jerry
$wp_functions = array(
    '_wp_simple_function' => '/functions-meta.php',
    '_wp_passref_function' => '/comment-functions.php',
    '_wp_returnref_function' => '/comment-functions.php',
    ...
);

// Function includer for... including functions.
function wp_include_function($func) {
    if ( ! function_exists($func) )
        require_once(ABSPATH . WPINC . $wp_functions["$func"]);
}

// function wrapper for no-reference function (args are copies)
function wp_simple_function() {
    wp_include_function('_wp_simple_function');
    $args = func_get_args();
    return call_user_func_array('_wp_simple_function', $args);
}

// Function wrapper for pass-by-reference function (args are references)
function wp_passref_function(&$arg1, &$arg2) {
    wp_include_function('_wp_passref_function');
    return _wp_passref_function($arg1, $arg2);
}

// Function wrapper for return-reference function (returns a reference)
function &wp_returnref_function() {
    wp_include_function('_wp_returnref_function');
    $args = func_get_args();
    return call_user_func_array('_wp_returnref_function', $args);
}
--- end wp-functions.php

The files in wp-includes would then declare the functions with an
underscore prepended to the name. This might be worthwhile for some of
the less-used core includes, but certainly not the entire set. It
would be a heluvan overhaul, so methinks 1.6 would be out of the
question. Let fly the opinions.

Message-ID: <43464856.3080209@kriga.net>

Hallo all,

my Name is Kristian Gavran and I'm transisting my homepage from a 
selfwritten simple CMS system to wordpress.
I make good progresses, the transition is already complete. Along the 
transition I've found an annoying point in the comment post section.
When the user forget to fill in all the needed Information just a simple 
error message appears.

I thought that a small "Go back and try again" Button on the bottom of 
the error message would be a good Idea.
So I've made a small patch adressed to this issue. Maybe you find it 
usefull and can commit it. (I have to admit that this is my first patch 
to an open source project. So when somthing is not ok or you have some 
suggestions, please tell it to me, so that I can make it right :-)

Maybe later when I have some time (and nobody else do it ;-) I will try 
to intigrate this (or maybe all?) error messages into the existing 
templates system of worldpress.

   -Kristian

I think that either dynamic includes, or at the very least a
reorganization of file includes would be great. On my own time I've
done some APD runs on the WordPress code, and consistantly about 60%
of the time for loading any page was on including files and declaring
functions. WordPress currently has 982 functions [1] of which a
considerable amount are loaded on every pageload. I'm up for any way
of cutting back on this, and I've often thought of something about
exactly what Andy posted but never got around to writing about such a
system.

Later on, I'll run some more apd tests with a varying number of themes
and try to track down exactly which functions are loaded and where
some things could be cut out, moved around, or moved to a system like
Andy suggested.

That's a good last-resort in the system, but both included themes should 
also check this via js onsubmit.

Submit this as a bug to http://trac.wordpress.org.

WordPress needs a good comb-through for all of those die()-style errors 
so that they can all be removed and replaced with friendlier, more 
informative, theme integral responses.

I'm not too familiar with the WP bug hunting process; do we ever do 
'tracker bugs' that one can just tack instances of such a thing on to?

If not, it's a good time to start :)

I'm not sure I quite understand your code. Are you suggesting we wrap
all function calls inside WP with wp_simple_function,
wp_returnref_function or wp_passref_function()? That's what I
originally thought until I checked your code for those funcitons; they
seem to be forwarding the call onto _wp_simple_function,
_wp_returnref_function and _wp_passref_function respectively, why?
Surely in your solution the thing to do would be to just call the
requested function within the non-underscored three functions... or am
I missing something?

+1. We should just redirect back to the comment page, fill in the
information that they sent, and insert a p, div etc. with a class of
"error", which themes would style. We could provide a default style
for themes that didn't bother, something like,

div.error { border: 1px solid #f00; }

Ah, that sounds so easy...

I advocate this style error for everything in the admin that doesn't get 
converted to Ajax (or even for those things that do get converted in the 
case of a no-javascript failover).  But for error messages that would 
appear inside a site's theme, this could be difficult, since users are 
free to customize that part of the form.

No existing theme would have the requisite new call to some 
comment_error_messasge() that would output such an error, and theme 
designers would want to be able to style the message and possibly even 
alter it entirely.

----
Ok, so here's a totally crazy idea:

Add a new function comment_error_message().  By default, this function 
echoes a hidden form field, like:

<input type="hidden" name="commenterrors" value="1" />

If this field is present when the comment is submitted, then when an 
error occurs, it reloads the comment page in a way (by passing an 
additional "commenterr=1" query value?) that causes 
comment_error_message() to output an error in addition to the hidden field.

When the function call isn't present, the commenterrors input value 
isn't included in the from, and the comment system die()s like it 
currently does.

The parameter of comment_error_message() overrides the default error text.

Yeah, that's convoluted.

Or name="show_comment_errors" or something like that.

We'd have to pass the error through the query string anyway, so
comment_error_message() could just do get_query_var('comment_error'),
echo it if it exists, or output the hidden input if not.

> Yeah, that's convoluted.

Not as much as you might think. From a theme designer's point of view,
all that's required is adding a comment_error_message() function to
their comment form. The only inelegance comes from the hidden input
and the forking that would be necessary in wp-comments-post.php to
check whether the hidden input was there, both of which are required
for backward compatability.

Those three functions are examples only. Actually, each wp_*()
function would be renamed _wp_*() and get its own little wrapper
function to include and call it. This way, none of the function calls
would have to change. The overhaul would be completely transparent to
plugins and themes as long as wp-functions.php was included before
plugins.

Why not just fire off something like do_action('comment_error','noauthor') 
at the point in wp-comments-post.php where now it dies with an error 
message?  The default action could just be what it does now, for backwards 
compatibility, but theme designers and plugin authors could remove that and 
add their own.

I think that comment was unfounded, the hacked user is running 1.5.2
and I'm not aware of any known security issues with the current
release.

It is likely the host that was exploited through something like the
cPanel exploit that has been circulating lately, if someone does get
hacked like that then their first port of call should be their host
not the Wordpress forums.

Hosts seem to be washing their hands of a lot of things lately, they
should at least do some due diligence first before blaming a third
party script but in this case it doesn't look like the host has even
been contacted yet.

Hey Ric,

Just letting you know i am halting webloog.com service.  A friend of mine that does security detection and repair for corporations told me of some nasty holes in the wordpress MU program.  Within the 10 minutes he looked he found 13 holes to get into the server...who knows how many more there are.  I had to let my host know about the access he did on the server so they are making me end the program asap also i dont want the potential of someone killing my host and other sites i run.

If you have someone else wanting to use the site i would highly suggest giving it to them...it's got a really high ranking right now so it would be good for someone to take over.  I will keep the database just in case you need it for any reasons.


Thanks Ric...i'll be notifing wordpress.org of the security risks.

Any security issues with any version of WordPress should be sent to 
security@wordpress.org and not to the public lists, as stated here:

http://wordpress.org/about/contact/

Hosting weblogs should not be taken on casually, it is a big responsibility.

Matt, how about some answers to his questions 1, 2 and 3?

1)  Can you let me know if his fears are founded?
2)  Is anyone on this list willing to accept support of this community on 
their servers?
3)  WordPress.Com is also an OpenDomain, but Matt still has not updated the

An answer like "Hosting weblogs should not be taken on casually, it is a big 
responsibility" is akin to saying "The sky is blue" when asked what time it 
is.

I for one, know this is at least the 2nd time Ric has requested a link be 
inserted to opendomain.org.

If it involves being part of the so-called "open domain" program, I 
would not recommend anyone do it.

According to http://opendomain.org/terms/ "These terms are not legal 
qualifications. They are written in general language for better 
understanding, and are not meant to be legally binding." In any case, I 
did not agree to any terms as I never believed that he had ANY right to 
be squatting our name and holding it hostage.

Domain squatting on other people?s trademarks is illegal, no matter if 
you call it "free" or "open" it?s still morally odious.

Domain squatting is neither illegal or amoral. Come off it.

"In any case, I did not agree to any terms as I never believed that he had 
ANY right to be squatting our name and holding it hostage."

So this is how you operate? Accept a domain that you did not purchase, then 
when its under your control deny the original owner had any rights to it? 
Thats a dick move.

Purchasing a domain gives you the right to it. Case closed. WordPress is not 
even a federally recognized trademark.

Off-topic this.

Actually, domain squatting -IS- illegal under the 1999
Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act... so... research before
flaming.

Perhaps you could point me to where I can find the WordPress trademark 
registration? Maybe documents of incorporation. 501C non-profit? Anything 
that would show it as an entity protected by the aforementioned act.

This is such a useless discussion. Obviously nothing anyone says is 
going to change the state of affairs in this issue. Give it up. Or rant 
on your blog about it, whatever.

Perhaps this whole discussion needs to go in an email to Matt if you
still have a problem. This was already declared off-topic, how about
you take it to where it belongs?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Referrer Spam
Message-ID: <20051010034158.alj6xje6csg0kkgk@banana.catalyst2.com>

Has anybody come across plenty of referral spam recently? Sex and pills from
Tonga in particular?

For the past week I have been getting about 500 illegitimate visits on a daily
basis. To make things worse, the page consistently requested is that which
'hammers' my server the most (and this appears to be no coincidence). Is it
possible that WordPress gets specifically targetted? I am judging as I look at
two completely separate domains running WordPress and I don't hear about
similar issues in UseNet's WWW-related groups. The spam appears to come from
the same folks, but for the latter domain this began only a few days ago and is
on the rise. Tens of thousands of database queries a day still get invoked in
vain by the spammers and this appears to exacerbate as the days go by.

Am I alone in this? Could you please check your logs? Many .to suffixes as one
symptom?

Cheers,

Roy

"...a massive Referrer Spam attack is ongoing (and apparently not just

my server logs with links to blue-pill Tonga subdomains: buy.to,

That's very informative. Thanks for that. Earlier today I attempted to 
re-direct
spammy requests, but the spammers will easily find a way around, e.g. simply
selecting a different entry point, thus making it a cat-and-mouse game.

Some time in the past the error logs came up with repeated attempts to take
advantage of PHP-Nuke exploits (READ: get admin privileges via loopholes).
Consequently, I systematically re-directed fishy URL's for all 
installations to
http://schestowitz.com/hacker.html .

On the contrary, the issue with WordPress-targetted attacks -- the ones 
which I
mentioned above -- is that genuine pages get requested by a wide range of IP
addresses (not Tonga). By re-directing as above real visitors can be 
obstructed
or offended at worst.

That seems like a sound solution. Fear the day of global gigabit Ethernet

Though, SV has a much higher barrier to entry. But if you're able to use 
it, it can actually reduce the spam traffic before it can even reach 
your web server.

Subject: [wp-hackers] get_pages() supporting depth argument
Message-ID: <434B00AD.8010700@soletechnology.com>

Well I'm using get_pages() and looping through raw pages in few places 
(rather our HTML/Wordpress guy), but ran into a place where we needed to 
pass the depth argument so that only one level of subpages would get 
returned.  I don't know if it's frowned upon to use get_pages() 
directly, but anyway, I figured it might as well support depth, it 
doesn't really hurt anything.  Here's a patch for 1.5.2.

BTW - Is it doing anyone any good for me to pass these changes along?  I 
don't really have time to work with the live (current) WordPress code, 
but thought maybe someone could benefit from my changes..

Dougal, I read about SpamValve and I appreciate your suggestion. As it's the
first time spam of that scale hit me (peaking at over 200 MB of dynamic 
content
per day), I decided to just re-direct to a forbidden (code 403) page. This has
worked for over a day.

I know that SV will have a more limited audience (thus my comment about 
the high barrier to entry). But I wanted to be sure that people were 
aware of it. I'm hoping one day to set up some sort of distributed share 
of the blacklist information though. This would allow a separate plugin 
to utilize the information, though without the firewalling abilities.

Since SV only blacklists a host after it triggers spam tests multiple 
times, I consider it to be fairly high-confidence information. And since 
it automatically expires entries after a period of inactivity, it 
shouldn't have too many false-positives due to dynamic IP addressing.

some hosts provide SSH access on their shared hosting plans & some

Bad Behavior does something similar, but instead of redirecting to a 403

its simply uses the die() I think!!

centralised balcklist? didn't Mark Ghosh start a project called CSPAM

I think that current plugins that blacklists, like Spam Karma, also use
something like this, meaning expiring IPs & domains which cease to
spam, no?

But I like your idea overall, blacklisting at firewall level will save 
quite a
many resources, especially for blogs that get a lot of spam!! :)

Not my host *frown*. Consider yourself to be fortunate if you are allowed
SSH/Telnet access. The best I can ever do when wishing to invoke commands is
use

I could possibly ask them to do that as they are quite kind. It all depends on
how many tickets they have open at the time.

Judging by the logs tonight, my main domain wind up serving 8000 requests for
403.shtml yesterday. Had the redirection not been in place, gigabytes of
on-the-fly traffic would have gone wasted. All the referrers are Tonga 
domains,
but none is a Tonga IP address. Make you wonder, eh? Those bloody 
spammers have
slowed down crawling by search engines, I suspect, not to mention destroyed
logs and made statstics virtually meaningless. Is there anything the spammers
would not ruin? Even the manual intervention makes it all a PITA and this
continues to get worse by the day.

Uhm may I suggest that you consider switching hosts? SSH is kind of
standard these days, I certainly won't consider a host unless they
provide SSH access, most won't give Telnet access as that is just a
big security risk and I wouldn't want to use that anyway.

WP-Blacklist (formerly by Mark Ghosh, now by Fahim Farook) would be able
to use that information if it were available as a DNS blacklist.

It's the same in Denmark where I come from: most cheap webhosts also
don't want to give you SSH access. :-(  So for me it was a big luxus
when I got it for my site with a US host.

If you have PHP you might find my PHP Shell script useful for simple
things: http://mgeisler.net/php-shell/.  It's very simple, using just
the standard proc_open() command in PHP.

I know what you mean when you say "cheap webhosts", but then again, 
most shared
hosting is rather cheap. The hosts otherwise get no customers (that gradually
expand) and therefore fail to survive. Try to compete with Hosting for a Buck,
for instance.

I often imagine that ownership (e.g. dedicated server) warrants SSH access. I
also imagine that the hosts don't want people to use their server as
computational hosts. I got told off for doing it in some local clusters at
daytime due to temptation.

Thanks, Martin. I'll have a look.

uhm, one would consider SSH only if they have a need for it. Most people 
just don't need it & those like me don't even know how to use it, so 
there, they don't complain on not getting it. :)
ok, lets keep this off list now, its not for this list to be discussed 
on. :)

Getting back on topic, the scale of the attacks is beginning to become scary,
not just worrying. As I said at the start, it continues to grow by the day
(nearing 2 weeks now) and it's reaching the point where I get tens of 
thousands
of page requests from a variety of UIP's. This still gets worse by the 
hour and
I am running out of bandwidth (although I re-directed to reduce it), not to
mention the speed penalty that the shared server is susceptible to.

These attacks can wind up costing hundreds of pounds, not to mention 
the time I
spend/t trying to stop them. I have no root access to the Web server. Any
suggestions? I would rather not tell the hosts and ignite some sort of
reputation of a trouble-maker.

Cheers,

Roy

I think it would be wise to block the offending IPs for some time(using
.htaccess). If they similar, then block their entire C class block. I 
had an
attack of this kind sometime back & blocked 2-3 C class blocks that were
the repeat offenders for sometime. this might loose out on some
legitimate traffic but its worth it in my opinion.

also, if your host is not an idiot, they wouldn't label you as a trouble 
maker
if you go to them with this problem. it would be wise as well to let 
them
know of the problem, as they are better equipped to handle the situation
than you are, as they too don't want someone sniping away at their
server, possibly a DoS attack!! :)

Dropping in at this discussion so might have missed some vital info.

How on earth could you be seen as troublemaker while you are trying to 
solve a problem, that might become a potential problem for your hosting 
provider as well. I would contact the hosting company and explain them 
the problem, if they are reluctaned to help you out, its time to switch 
provider.

I wish you all the luck in solving this annoying problem!

grtz,
BjornW

I personally recommend http://www.dreamhost.com/  Very reasonable, PHP,
MySQL, full ssh access.

Like I said earlier, try "Bad Behaviour". You might have missed the FAQ on
his site, so here's a quote from his FAQ page
(http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior/bad-behavior-faq/):
---
Will Bad Behavior reduce my site's bandwidth usage?
Absolutely! This is one of the reasons for Bad Behavior's existence. By
preventing spambots and other malicious bots from ever accessing any of your
pages, your bandwidth usage will drop significantly. How much depends on how
many malicious bots visit your site regularly. On higher traffic sites
paying a premium for bandwidth, this may well decrease your web hosting
bill.

This plugin requires no maintenance, which I like and it has worked for me
so far.

I rarely require SSH access. SSH is merely a luxury that one can adapt to by
changing a few habits e.g. using command-line rather than front-ends to file
management. The last thing I want to do is move away from hosts that served me
so well with approximately 99.9% uptime, even now that I suffer the spam
equivalent of the Slashdot Effect on a daily basis.

I think I once read about Dreamhost.com banning a user from establishment of
database connections as he was hammering it too hard. That sounds incompetent
to me as they appeared to have not preceded the move with a gentle warning.
That's the problem with large 'meat market' companies that perceive their
clients as 'little people'.

That's certainly not their standard practice, and if it did happen it's 
more likely that the user was not telling the whole story.  I've hosted 
with dozens of hosts over the last ten years, and dreamhost is easily 
the most friendly.

I've had several instances of zombied processes, and a few slashdottings 
(well, boingboingings) on my own sites.  Dreamhost didn't punish me for 
the events, rather they forgave the high bandwidth on those days (saving 
me hundreds of dollars).  A good host, by my measure.

I'm not sure I'd call ssh a luxury either.  As a developer (often of web 
applications), tools like scp, and rsync are minimally required for 
keeping large sites synchronized.  Having tools like CVS, too, make the 
life of a web dev really quite nice.  Try to live without those, with 
only FTP, SMB or web forms?  You would be wasting a lot of time 
incrementally updating by hand (or uploading the whole damned thing).

The spammy traffic is getting violently high at the moment, so I am forced to
act upon it quickly. AWStats has been running for a long time (still does)
processing the logs of the past 3 hours. I have just downloaded today's log
(over 15 MB since midnight, but traffic peaking drastically this 
afternoon) and
my worst fear is a reality. The IP addresses of the offenders are so
well-distributed that you could barely ever isolate ham from spam using IP
blocks as a criterion. Blocks A-D vary a lot.

I'll tell them immediately, thanks for the suggestion. I wish I had done that
when it all got started, but I was on vacation. I wonder what trick a host
could possibly pull off the sleeve. If they cannot filter successfully, the
site might have to go down. Spammers should be shot.

As in many circumstances, I hear what you say about denial of crucial 
facts and
I agree. Like one of these "my password doesn't work, so it MUST be 
YOUR fault"
type-of-situations. Or a "by the way, I re-installed my operating system
yesterday. Can THAT be why VPN no longer works, as opposed to a problem 
at your
end?" situation.

I guess it depends on the nature of the site. gFTP and Konqueror multi-thread
FTP traffic so they are not too bad as an SCP alternative. CVS is intended to
serve sites whose purpose in unorthodox, unless the host is not a /Web/ 
host or
content is tightly-correlated to programming or documentation. I run CVS and
MATLAB on one such Web server which I SSH to, but it's only accessible to the
Faculty and is located in the server room a few metres to my left. Such 
servers
are prone to breakage and are unlikely to be maintained by or be 
considered good
business to Web hosts (for a reasonable price). It's a niche.

Luxury? It's a requirement for my hosting needs...

Tell any developer they need to deploy applications on a server but they 
can't have ssh access and see what they say, because I know what I say, 
and I usually say it may take twice as long, and cost twice as much, 
because sometimes it does...

Just jumping in here to state the obvious; SSH provides a secure way
to access a system via command line. It's far from a luxury as many
tasks are cumbersome without shell access (and of course, Telnet is
bad...).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Zombies aimed at WordPress
Message-ID: <20051013104732.gag4y8fogdk4s0wg@banana.catalyst2.com>

I apologise to have started a new thread, but there are many new dimensions to
this problem, which increases/spreads exponentially as it seems. All
occurrences of zombie attacks of this kind (see previous thread for context)
target WordPress... at least the ones I am aware of, having researched the Web.
 The spammers handpick sensitive (read: heavy) WordPress-generated pages. I have
only comes across 3 occurrences of such attacks, best characterised by Tonga
domains in the referrer field. All occur around the same time across the
domains.

The zombies in question are all Windows-based and they almost double in number
on a daily basis. I shall soon collaborate with my Web host (SpamValve and Bad
Behaviour spring to mind). otherwise, considering the current pace of
expansion, my domain would be isolated from cyberspace.  They are eCommerce
sites whose income depends on the Web and their shops are crippled by attacks
on my site.

The attacks I know of affect Windows-, Linux-, and Mac-oriented sites, so there
is no O/S zeal as a motive; maybe there is CMS zeal, if at all.

More evidence of the problems are beginning to resurface. Some of you in this
list might be affected, but have not noticed it yet. This began (for me) at the
start of this month. There were only dozens of attacks at the start so they were
hard to notice among the logs. Use Technorati to find information on the attacks
as it's all fairly recent so unindexed. One source claims that there are many
sites affected, but they choose to remain silent or wait for a diminish rather
than expansion of this disease. Even the mainstream media exposed similar
issues a day ago. Some of you may have heard of the Dutch gang that had 100,000
zombies and planned an attack. They have just been arrested. A friend of mine
said it is a small scale considering what else if out there already.

I posting this to wp-hackers because it appears to have developed into a
possible yet-to-be-seen plague that is most detrimental to WordPress. Judging
by the pattern of the attacks, I can make a few speculations. The spammers
hijacks or simply inject a rogue process with hard-coded URL's that vary (both
referrer and target URL vary, thereby making it hard to filter).

I don't want to get political (admittedly I have the tendency), but who is
liable? It is sure not the host, or Apache, or WordPress (I won't pull Matt's
finger - pun intended). Who is it that used code spaghetti that left a gap to
be exploited in the O/S? Or lazy ISP's that harbour rotten traffic? Countries
of shame in this case are China with thrice as many attacks than Russia at
second. Something must be done. This keeps doubling and affecting more blogs.

We've had the same attack yesterday on Parisist (http://www.parisist.com)
which runs a Movable Type.
So I don't think it's a Wordpress only attack.

Have you found any generic solution yet? All solutions that I could gather are
not simple to incorporate (see below). I am still waiting for some software to
be installed on the server.

* Bad Behaviour - needs access to server (pointed out here)

* SpamValve - root privileges? (pointed out here)

* modsecurity.org - root privileges? (pointed out in Manchester's LUG)

* Patch-o-Matic netfilter/iptables  <
http://www.netfilter.org/patch-o-matic/pom-extra.html > - needs installing
(from the Linux advocasy NG) -  one wonders about the name, which resembles
"Ping-o-Matic"

* Apache .htaccess filter for Tonga domains - untested and hard to test 
reliably

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .to/
RewriteRule .* - [F]

(John Bokma from alt.www.webmaster)

Hope this turns out to be handy to someone else...

Patch-O-Matic has been around far longer than Ping-O-Matic, for what
it's worth.

Uhm no it doesn't and hence why several times you've been recommended
to install it:

http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior/installing-and-using-bad-behavior/on-wordpress/

Well unless you call FTP'ng the plugin files "Access to the server"
but if you don't have FTP well no comment...

That's why I was very careful with the phrasing. I imagine that there could be
yet another o-Matic service that predates both. I can evem think of Love-Matic
Grampa from the Simpsons (listening to it at this very moment!)

I've been very happy with Referrer Karma from
http://unknowngenius.com/blog/

It catches thousands of referrer spam hits per day and I suppose it's
blocking zombies also? It integrates very easily into WordPress and
cooperates nicely with Spam Karma.

3rd time lucky? haha...bad-behaviour does not need server access. it's a
plugin. drop in and activate, then forget. so if u have access to your admin
pages you can use bad-behaviour. (i view logs using phpadmin - althought
bb-stats can be used to see stats generated from this plugin)

i used to use referrer-bouncer plugin, but then i needed separate plugins
for comment spam. now bad-behaviour catches all these before a page is
requested.

if it seems i'm pushing bad-behaviour so much, it's because i'm sick of
spammers.

if more people used this or a similar technique that blocks page access from
spambots, it'd make a big difference (for legit users and spammers -
depending on perspective) imho.

Whichever plugin you use, remember this: as long as it either use php and the
sql database or htaccess or any other resource like this, in case of serious
attack (hundreds or thousands simultaneously), your server will certainly run
out of memory, crash, or even reboot if it was not perfectly to handle such a
traffic.

this is true, but in extreme cases like this, the logging level can be
adjusted or even switched off via plugin settings.

i suppose if you do get a volume as large as you mentioned simultaneuosly,
then that would be a bit of a problem with or without these measures.

Oh, sorry...! My misinterpretation. The only glaring pitfall is that it covers
WordPress only, which probably occupies around 10% of my site's content. There
is indeed an advantage to using a single, uniformal CMS across the entire site
as opposed to a diversity. It decreases the amount of work associated with
critical updates and it saves some learning curve, complements integration and
so forth. Then again, what would you do when features "in the wild" do not
overlap sufficiently? For example, image galleries using WordPress, Wiki
intergation with/encapsulation in WordPress, Forums and blog software...

This might serve as a temporary solution. If the attacker moves to 
other pages,
I will be exposed again. A solution at Apache (or equiv.) level seems 
better in
the long run.

Will it not be hard to tell what it does 'behind the scenes'? I mean, 
apart from
reviewing the code, there need to be some good summaries. Spaminator, for
example, was terrible as it killed some genuine comments and it only logged
using individual E-mails. Looking at each E-mail in turn was impractical,
laborious and error-prone. When you compose your own rules and keep them
simple, it is easier to know what is going on. Thus, you are bound to 
feel more
relieved with the plug-in/s enabled. There were other such plug-ins which were
problematic. CAPTCHA plug-ins, for instance, caused me (Well... commenters
rather) a lot of trouble.

The little I have done seems to have led to same cessation in the number of
attacks. It's based on a very short time period though, so I can't get 
my hopes
up, yet.

Actually, Bad behaviour provides cover to any PHP powered site.
There's a convenient plugin for WP but you can plug it into a non-WP
site easily.

Huh? First you make a big political speech about zombies targetting
Wordpress sites only and then a solution to address problems with
Wordpress isn't adequate as Wordpress is only used for 10% of your
site, so which is it?

FYI Bad Behavior also runs with Drupal, MediaWiki, Geeklog and
DotClear out of the box with logging and you can use it on any other
PHP script but you lose the logging unless you are knowledgable enough
to port it over:

http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior/installing-and-using-bad-behavior/

Personally I only use Spam Karma 2 at the moment as I only get the
ocassional bot trying to post comments and SK2 takes care of that just
fine.

Also I saw you mentioned earlier that you were generating AWStats
during the day (well US time at least), you probably don't want to do
that as that would upset your host more than what the attacks would as
it takes quite a bit of grunt to process those stats.

yes, a solution at the server level would be better, but more tedious to
maintain. in the end it's what's best for your situation i suppose.

<snip from site>

...

By default Bad Behavior can provide protection to any PHP script out of 
the box,
but it cannot provide logging. If you are willing to live without Bad 
Behavior?s
detailed logs, simply install the Bad Behavior folder somewhere on your 
server,
and then call require_once("/path/to/bad-behavior/bad-behavior-generic.php");
from your PHP script. I recommend placing this function call in a common piece
of PHP code which is loaded from all parts of your PHP-based software, so that
it can provide protection to all parts of your software.

...

</snip>

Bad Behaviour relies on the fact that requests bubble through
bad-behavior-generic.php if I understand this correctly (having not looked at
it in too much depth). What about static pages (the vast majority of my site)?
Or other methods of dynamic page generation?

You are very right at pointing my gross mistake. Bad Behaviour is not 
WordPress
only, but rather a simplification was made by wrapping it up in a plug-in with
the necessary header and it contains all the necessary files and the rational
progression of steps in the WP main loop.

Bad Behaviour still serves as somewhat of a bubble that needs to be 
called every
single time a destined PHP script is run (with possible optimisations 
like "use

Depending on the size of the logs, the popularity of the site, and 
exactly what you are generating in the reports. I run two sites on 
WordPress, and I run a 'today' report every few hours with Analog, and 
it typically takes less than 2 minutes to run. I also nice the process 
to not take too much processing power. Analog probably runs a lot faster 
than AWstats though.

You could do something like:

http://www.webpronews.com/webdevelopment/basicdevelopment/wpn-37-20040429HTACCESSWrapperswithPHP.html

To add the PHP to every request for .htm(l) files.

Okay so we are trying to help you stop an attack that is currently
ocurring and instead of implementing measures that we recommend you
waffle on about how better solutions are needed in the long term and
how the solutions don't address all potential problems.

How about instead you implement some or all of the proposed solutions
and limit the effectiveness of the current attack against your site
and then look at longer term solutions that cover all your bases?

You are right at putting it that way. I mistakenly posted with the 
subject line
"Re: [wp-hackers] Zombies aimed at WordPress" although I intended to put
question marks at the end. By the time I had posted the message I 
realised that
it was too late to add indication of doubt. I have just renamed the subject
line, hoping it would not lead to anomalies among other people's E-mail client
(fragmented threading).

In principle, I sought a solution that will protect the site by principle, not
just WordPress. That's what I had in mind all along. If the spammers 'stop by'
Bad Behaviour et al., I believe that would still muck up the logs.

Yes, I'm aware of the issue with aggregating numbers at the end; it is taking
big lumps of memory, especially when large logs are involved and IP tables can
become huge. Having said that, the attackers change targetted URL's. Some such
URL's take _megabytes_ per page request. it's no coincidence. The attacks aim
for it. Therefore, I must keep abreast of what they do and redirect to
403.shtml as soon as possible. I even removed images and stripped things off
that page temporarily. Had I not done that yesterday, I estimate that roughly
2MB x 30,000 (~60GB) of bandwidth would have been requested for the 'most
sensitive' page which flagged the beginning of these attacks around Oct. 2nd.
Needless to say, that traffic would not have been delivered. The server would
have denied access or grind to a halt. To make matters worse, it is a shared
server.

There are a few, I think mainly with the install scripts as they try
to insert nulls into columns with "NOT NULL" set, MySQL 4.X doesn't
enforce that (strange but true) and 5.0 does.

Do we have a bug in Trac for that?  If not, could someone familiar with
the issue write up a bug?  And add a patch. :-)

How is this behavior any different. IIRC, 4.x does check, but just
like in PHP, '' is not null, NULL is null, there is a difference.
Either way, the default column is still there, so the behavior should
remain as expected.

Without getting into whatever politics and domain squatting or
whatever else is going on, the security audit that was performed here
appears to point to holes in the WPMU code (at least that is the
implication of the letter). Is this true? Are these concerns being
addressed?

As I am getting ready to implement what will become a rather large
WPMU site for facutly,. staff, and students at my institution, such
questions are important.

I have not received any security details or information, so I'm inclined 
to call this crying wolf until we do.

To the Wordpress team:

As I am not a php expert, I did not validate the claims.  I thought this was 
the place to air concerns of this nature.

This has nothing to the OpenDomain program - I just received an email from a 
user of one of the domains.  I did find another person to support this WPMU 
community, and they have not found any problems.

Here is the original email I received from Scott Skykes.

-----------------------------
Hey Ric,

Just letting you know i am halting webloog.com service.  A friend of mine 
that does security detection and repair for corporations told me of some 
nasty holes in the wordpress MU program.  Within the 10 minutes he looked he 
found 13 holes to get into the server...who knows how many more there are. 
I had to let my host know about the access he did on the server so they are 
making me end the program asap also i dont want the potential of someone 
killing my host and other sites i run.

If you have someone else wanting to use the site i would highly suggest 
giving it to them...it's got a really high ranking right now so it would be 
good for someone to take over.  I will keep the database just in case you 
need it for any reasons.


Thanks Ric...i'll be notifing wordpress.org of the security risks.

~Scott Sykes~
---------------------------------------------

Scott - can you please post the holes you found publicly?

As Matt has said,  any security issues with WordPress should be sent to
security@wordpress.org and not to the public lists (as stated at
http://wordpress.org/about/contact/).

Matt,

Contact me personally if you wish Scott's email

Also, the new user of http://www.webloog.com/  is Mathew Evens - you can get 
his contact info at http://Bloog.Com
He sure can use your help fixing this site. I do not know Matt Evens 
personally, he is just an OpenDomain user.  Please do not punish him or the 
WebBloog WordPress community because you decided to break your word.

What part of "security issues with WordPress should be sent to
security@wordpress.org" did you not understand?  No need to send this
Scott fellow's mail, just send the security issues to the security list
and stop bothering people on this list with these vague and useless
assertions of problems.

WP Hackers,

Per Matt's suggestion, I joined this list to find someone to develop a
plugin for a new metasearch tool we unleashed this week... http://gada.be/ -
and if you haven't already checked it out, I'd invite you to do so.

I formally requested a Drupal plugin earlier this afternoon, although I'd
wager that most folks who'd want to use it are already on WordPress. Still,
if you'd like the reference: http://drupal.org/node/34200

Chad Everett crafted an amazing plugin for MovableType, and I'd imagine
something extremely similar could be done for WordPress by someone on this
list (or anybody): http://www.everitz.com/sol/mt-gadabe/

If you can help, please let me know.

Chris

Maybe I'm just thick, but I've clicked all over gada.be, the drupal and 
everitz pages, and have no idea what this plugin is supposed to do... 
besides "integrate your site with the new gada.be <http://gada.be/> 
metasearch service, just by using template tags to provide links right 
on your entry pages!" which is basically jargon. Links to what?

Nice work on the site, by the way!

Think of it as an alternative to tagging to Technorati. The MT plugin goes
as far as to let the user add a slug to the end of a keyword to output that
particular URL (several options are listed on the http://gada.be/about
page). Does that provide any clarification?

Thanks for looking. ;)

As I understand it, you would put keywords in your post like "shiny 
gadget" and then it would return a link to a gada.be search for that 
keyword(s).

Nice idea. However, the aggregation or centralisation of search engine 
has been
discussed to death at hntp://alt.internet.search-engines. It's often like an
attempt to mix chocolate icecream with vanilla, blendering some cherries and
then melting them all together to get some sort of puree. It just 
doesn't work.
No wonder one such service is called "Dogpile".

the extra bits aside appear to me like 'toy features', but I am not sure they
can truly enhance the quality of SERP's.

UPDATE: I totally miscomprehended the idea of the project. Ignore 
comments above
completely and consider removing the referrer bits at the bottom of the 
page to
a separate (new) page. You don't need that indicator of status, which is
deceiving.

I think the intention of crafting such a plug-in is merely to serve as 
promotion
for your site. What evidence is there to suggest that the product of such a
plug-in will contribute to the users' experience?

Having said that, I am sure there are some enthusiastic folks who would 
use this
as a jolly opportunity to hop aboard and implement a plug-in that integrates
closely with your API's.

Best of luck, Chris. It's a nice idea with great potential.

I second that. I have just taken it for a spin and bookmarked it. 
Meta/semantic
search is something I am particularly interested in these days (see bottom of

Yeah, now I get it :)

WordPress has a seriously kick-ass tagging plugin called ultimate tag 
warrior (http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/), and I do think 
the best way to pursue this would be as an option in UTW of how to 
output the tags.

Interestingly, technorati extracts tags from the stuff at the end of a 
url, eg <link rel="tag">foo.com/bar/whatever</a>mytag</a> becomes tagged 
as 'whatever'. Since your engine puts the tags--so to speak--as 
hostnames (ie. http://tag.gada.be/), they won't work as technorati tags. 
I'm not sure whether this is technorati's problem or yours, but it's 
easy to fix by letting searches to gada.be/tag redirect to tag.gada.be.

...no more than linking to Technorati does. Or any other tag vendor, for
that matter. I'm just trying to level the playing field - one link to link
'em all, so to speak. Fool's errand, maybe - but I've gotta try.

We don't really have an API, per se - just a simple form at this point. That
said, I'm hoping the developer will be attending the forthcoming TagCamp in
San Jose (wherein gada.be is a sponsor).

Thanks for the nod, Roy. We're getting additional servers this weekend, just
in case we get featured on Digg again (or, heaven forbid, Slashdot).

Oh dear. I meant, <a href="http://foo.com/bar/whatever" 
rel="tag">mytag</a> is picked up by technorati as a tag for 'whatever'.

...still exists over here... and I flushed cache.

Add a "what's it all about" link that's prominent. I have pointed some 
mates to
gada.be/about, which in the the rational entry point to unfamiliar faces.

You can never get that to happen unless you become a monopoly and spit on the
industry as well as morals. Don't let that fact evade you.

Contextually a good fit:

I know this does not fit in this mailing list directly, but if gada.be 
was ever
to be considered as a WordPress plug-in, it's worth taking a moment aside for
assessment (or worse -- critique). As I continue to explore your service, I
find that some aspects of the results (other than major search engines) can be
filled with spam. Depending on the nature of use, this can become a real
deterrent because there is too much noise for results to be worthwhile.

Perhaps you are already fed some tagging spam (sometimes a side-effect of
content scraping) and must become more selective and possibly involve some
human moderation if not automate something. The services you feed on 
might have
to do likewise (or disposed of altogether until they sanitise their sources)
because you only serve as an 'RSS bridge' here.

By the way, there appears to be a bug as sometimes the navigation footer does
not show up.

Best Regards,

Roy

Aside: I wonder how gada.be is pronounced (/about doesn't say). It is almost a
homonym of the notorious Soviet secret services.

I just posted something about that on my blog. At least, it's directed at
Blogspot. I'm suggesting they deploy a captcha mechanism in their publishing
system (not just for comments, but for entry submissions themselves). It's
the only thing that could "easily" stop the bots - though I know they'd be
throwing out the metaweblog baby with the bathwater.

Since gada.be is acting as an intermediary, once we have user registration
for our system, it's likely we could flag links as spam - but that, too,
could be abused (think: competition). If we figure it out, though, we'll be
sure to share our tactic with the rest of the industry. ;) del.icio.us has
been spammed, too - although not like you think it has. We're certainly open
to suggestions.

One of the reasons why gada.be places a rel="nofollow" attribute into each
and every outgoing link is because I don't want it to be directly used to
game anything.

I've already suspended / killed four of 'em for doing so, and contacted the
ones who made it easy to contact. Seekitall was one of the worst offenders,
and I'm about one day away from killing Broadsnatch.

That's odd. We've got an update to our fetch code (100% scratch) coming
within the next couple of days, making it easier to parse non-compliant
feeds - of which there are millions. ;) Could be part of the problem. I'll
keep my eye out for it, and register it in our bug-tracking system.

I'm honored and humbled that you would take the time to help, Roy.

Blogspot's problems extend (or /used to/ because Google started acting 1-2
months ago) beyond the issue of post, comment, and ping spam. One of the
notorious participants in our SEO forum was acquiring deleted blogs 
immediately
after disappearance, thus inheriting PageRank, which using the sidebar could
fuel his public domain content garbage (nearing a million pages). He was
Googleating for quite some time, accumulating over 15,000 visits per day.
Recently he has been less vocal so I imagine that Blogspot prosperity is over
for him.

Yes, I am aware of del.icio.us' issues too. Just let that be used as a 
directory
a la DMOZ, for the purpose of improving SE's, then see how quality takes the
dive. It was bound to happen all along.

Even collaborative spam flagging for E-mail and comments are going to suffer
from link greed (blame backlinks algos). The technology is new so it is not
targetted yet, much like blogs which were not suffering from comment spam 5
years ago. Worse is fact is the fact that false positives in spam 
flagging lead
to disappearance of genuine messages, not obfuscation of Web content.

I posted the following URL in this mailing list before:

Hi Chris,
I saw your request for a plugin and have been working on it but I'm 
pretty green when it comes to string parsing so my methods for coming up 
with a suitable way to make a gada.be url aren't working all that well. 
Right now, my design involves adding a <gadabe> tag and quickbutton to 
wordpress so that any keywords that are surrounded by that will be 
turned into a proper gada.be search link.

I saw that the IE bookmarklet calls something called searchParse.php in 
order to generate the appropriate url and was wondering if you should 
send me the appropriate code snippet to go from a keyword or phrase to url.

Thanks,
Jon Abad

I'll try to get ahold of the developer of that one, too.

I've been discussing this with S. Siram as of late. Most likely, we need a
new way of defining where the tag sits inside the URL. I kinda broke the
mold, accidentally.

Message-ID: <4354C526.1030201@isness.org>

Hi,
I just joined the list, so wanted to say hello suggest something.

I've been using get_posts to build pages from multiple categories, which is working fine, except that I generally want to return every single post rather than a specific number. I'm currently setting numberposts=200 but it seems a bit dumb.

In admin->options->reading->blogpages you can set -1 to return everything, but get_posts doesn't return the same.

Basically I'm wondering if anyone thinks it would be a worthwhile improvement if get_posts worked the same way.

I did have a fairly thorough look around, but couldn't find a way to search the archives. So, apologies if this has been discussed before.

Dorian

Subject: [wp-hackers] Upgrade not completing
Message-ID: <435517A9.60309@tamba2.org.uk>

The blog has a database size of at least 60meg. No stats, no extra stuff 
- just posts and comments make that size.

Some code:
Posted by <em><strong><?php the_author() ?></strong></em> in <?php 
the_category(', ') ?>

That produces the error:
"Posted by XXX in

WordPress database error: [You have an error in your SQL syntax; check 
the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right 
syntax to use near '' at line 1]
SELECT category_nicename FROM wp_categories WHERE cat_ID= "

Viewing the blog from the Manage Posts screen, that error is repeated 
once per post per category.

Underneath that error though, the category is linked as such:
http://www.example.com/blog/archives/category/
which is wrong as the name of the cat, though visible as the link, is 
not actually there.
Searching the forums finds nothing on this error.

If I try to run upgrade - because all the code is fine and 1.5.2 - it 
stops after ~34 seconds every time. It does not complete the process. Is 
this therefore a failed upgrade problem and if so, can it be overcome ?

I hope that this is a simple question:

Do we need to sanitize user input when adding/updating
the options table in wordpress plugins? See this
example:

// setting options
function sf_options() {
if ( isset($_POST['sf_directory']) ) {
$sf_directory = $_POST['sf_directory'];
update_option('sf_directory', $sf_directory, '','');
}
if ( isset($_POST['sf_prefix']) ) {
$sf_prefix = $_POST['sf_prefix'];
update_option('sf_prefix', $sf_prefix, '','');
}
}

In this case, I'm not doing anything like
mysql_real_escape_string() or trim() - Do I need to?

Thanks,
- Trevor

I think that means that $newvalue will be escaped twice: once when
WordPress applies addslashes to all $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, and
$_SERVER variables (wp-settings.php line 156 onwards), and once by the
escape method.

If that is so, then the correct way to handle things would be to first
use stripslashes() on $newvalue before passing it to $wpdb->escape.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Heads-up for people debugging fopen/etc. issues
	internally on PowWeb...

Since I just ran into this, though others in the developer community might 
find this info useful.

PowWeb, in their infinite wisdom, has implemented some kind of 
load-balancing solution for their websites. This has the side effect of 
basically locking-up any internal fopen/etc. request from a powweb page FOR 
a powweb page, using 'normal' URL conventions.

The solution (spent 10 minutes in the powweb forums looking at PHP Q&A) is 
to rewrite internal requests to use 'localhost'.

So if you want to reference:
http://www.somesite.com/blog/wp-rss2.php
... internally from powweb and somesite is on powweb, it must be rewritten
http://localhost.somesite.com/blog/wp-rss2.php
... when trying to fopen/fsockopen/etc. that page.  I'm not altogether sure 
if it is only the case if trying to fopen a somesite.com page FROM 
somesite.com code (i.e. a site trying to fopen URLs to itself...), or if 
it's a PowWeb-wide issue (i.e., a powweb site fopening a URL to another 
powweb site).

Since it was causing an issue for a guy trying to aggregate his own feed 
(using my CG-FeedRead plugin), I just figured others might want to know. 
Don't know if it's useful enough to want to go into the Wiki or not. ;)

This is resolved.
Mark Jaquith pointed me at wp-medic, and that showed some faulty hashes. 
Files replaced and all is good.

The upgrade not completing could be a future problem though ?

IMHO, this particular feature of WP-Medic would be a great feature to
self-check during the installation/upgrade, with the amount of
troubles I've seen with people having empty files or uploaded files in
the wrong type, etc.

I just double checked, and as far as I can see, this is true, and I do
remember a ton of posts on the forums and even a few on the old bug
tracker on not necessarily SQL injection but it failing to post
because people had a slash or two in their code

I stumbled across this yesterday on a local test WP install. I  
figured that for some reason, WP developers--who know more than me  
about PHP--thought it best to rely of magic quotes for wp-mail.php to  
function properly. I even searched trac to see whether it had been  
filed, but didn't report it because I assumed it was somehow my fault.

I fixed the problem on my installation simply by adding addslashes()  
around both the content and subject variables. I don't know whether  
there are other fields that need to be escaped, but that has seemed  
to work for me.

Oh, and by the way, hi, everyone. I'm new here, but have been  
silently 'listening' for a couple months.

magic_quotes doesn't apply here, this isn't from any superglobal. The
WP-Developers rely on their own magic_quotes type filtering of the
post and get superglobals for the rest of the code however (you can
view this in wp-settings.php).

I brought this issue up with Matt at the IRC meetup yesterday, so
hopefully we can get this fixed completely for 1.6, the whole
wp-mail.php should be getting a lot of love.

Dear Friends

I am an Iranian Developer and recently joined this group , I've been working
(and also hacking) wordpress for more than 9 months, I am famous in Iran
because of my tries on WP localization and Jalali Calendar.

I've just decided to be an WP Hacker for WP 1.6 and later versions, I've
just post a new entry on my new English blog and I want to know ur openions.

http://mani.wordpress.com/2005/10/20/web-apps-extend-edge/

PS . I Don't know this mailing list rule , should I post URLs(Like what I
did now) or should I post all the content here?

Thnx for your help

Subject: [wp-hackers] XHTML Strict compliant replacement for target=_new
Message-ID: <435803A8.2010505@zorched.net>

Hi, I'm new to the list and new to WordPress (just got it yesterday, and 
I think it's great so far).

One issue I had with adding sidebar links was the target=_new not being 
compliant with XHTML Strict. There's an easy way to emulate that 
behavior with an onclick event:

onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;"

I hard coded that into my sidebar links for the 1.5 system I've got up, 
but thought I'd provide a better? solution for the future. Basically, 
I've added another option below the 'Target' option on the add link page 
to toggle the 'Onclick open new window' trick. I added a column to the 
links table to support the Y/N choice for this flag.

As it's my first WordPress patch, I'd love to get feedback/comments. Is 
this useful for other people? Is it implemented well (I'm no PHP expert 
by any means). Any suggestions for improvement?

That needs to be tested.  If you use wp-mail, try it out.

Message-ID: <4dce0ec40510201622q73e28a7u6a387f11e61623eb@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on updating my LDAP authentication plugin so that (if you
so choose) it can automatically register users who successfully
authenticate against the LDAP server.  So far, I've had a patch
submitted to me that is more or less a copy of the 'adduser' block in
wp-admin/users.php

My question would be: is there a better way to do this?  I'm looking
into output buffering and faking POST data so that I can include
users.php into my plugin and have it register people via the official
WP codepath but it still seems pretty gross.  Is there any sort of
cleaner interface/method of registering a user inside of a plugin?

Searching the Codex, WP Code, and Google has left me empty-handed so
far.  Thus I turn to you, my fellow WP hackers.

yes & it'll look neat as well, than putting onClick handlers on all
links with the JS. besides, its centralised as well, so if anything
need to be modified, it can be done in the JS function rather than
messing in PHP to change the onclick handler code(making it
easy for the end-user).

That method is interesting. It also lead me to read about XHTML and  
DOM and realized (although I sort of knew this I think) that those  
specs are completely independent. So, while target is invalid XHTML  
(Strict) it's valid DOM . . . sort of weird? :)

Normally I would agree with you about inlining Javascript, but in  
this case it's one built-in Javascript function call, so I wasn't  
really concerned. It's no different functionally than hardcoding  
'_new' in the target because they both have a consistent defined  
behavior.

In the end, I guess what I was trying to provide was another  
automated option so that individuals wouldn't have to customize their  
install in code (which makes upgrades harder of course). Part of this  
is a philosophical question about the goals of WordPress in terms of  
how much to automate vs. how much to leave up to the individual to do  
on their own.

It would be fairly easy to code up a query to determine if the 'rel'  
type links were being used and if so, include the Javascript link in  
the header. So, you could completely automate that version as well.

Thoughts on this? What if we provided all 3 options and let the user  
choose? Does that make it way to complicated? Is it worth the effort?

Firstly I think the whole target=_new thing is a pain to begin with,
if I want to open a link in a new window I'll middle click on it thank
you very much and if the damned link uses Javascript and the middle
click fails then more often then not I just won't follow the link.

For this reason along with not wanting Javascript to be a requirement
just for a visitor to click a link then I don't think this is a good
solution so my vote goes for either scrapping the target=_new all
together or if it must stay then implementing the alternative
rel="external" solution posted in a later post.

Yes. If some blogger self-importantly presumes to make his external
links prevent *my* browser from leaving his site, I most certainly
WILL leave his site. I will thereafter lean away from that blogger's
sites, writings, comments and opinions in the future. It's just a bad
idea of the same ilk as trying to prevent people from viewing your
source by cancelling right clicks. Counsel against it.

Furthermore, the fact that you /can/ dynamically add a target
attribute to a an XHTML page in contemporary browsers does not make it
good, proper, standard or strict. Sure, there aren't any "validators"
that will complain because the XHTML looks good. However, to maintain
the idea of "strict" it is not merely the XHTML that should be valid;
it is the entire document, even while dynamic DOM manipulation occurs.
This should play out in the near future when browsers begin to treat
XHTML Strict pages /strictly/ and ignoring (or even complaining about)
invalid dynamic manipulation of the DOM. That means making JS
interpreters play by the rules, too.

That's my opinion, anyway.

I think, before going off on tangents about Javascript breaking the
middle click, you should try it, and you'll soon find out that it
works fine, because the href="" value isn't javascript:somecrap(), its
all done via the DOM.

As an aside, I pretty much agree with you on the user choice side of 
things. I just thought it would be interesting to have an XHTML 
compliant way of doing it if someone wants to.

One nit-pick though.
XHTML and DOM are 2 independent standards. *HTML standards (and others) 
are standards of markup that get represented in a browser/memory as DOM. 
DOM allows the target tag, so it should be legal. I too think it's a 
weird solution to the problem though.

Carry on.

Posting urls is fine.  Posting the same email 3 times is a little 
annoying ;-)

have you tried the code Jason? I suggest you try it first before 
commenting
on it. Middle-click & right-click "new window" work just like they 
should work.
its just that the target attribute is added via DOM which is not seen by 
any
validators.

again, Javascript is not a requirement for those links. They are 
perfectly alright
links which will open in the same window if the javascript is disabled 
or the
javascript file is not included in it the page. what that javascript 
does is just
get all the <a> tags which have an "href" attribute & a "rel" attribute 
whose
value is "external" and adds the 'target="_blank"' attribute to them, 
that's all!!

and if you don't know, that article was written by Kevin Yank who is a
respected author in the web-dev field & he doesn't write trash!! also, I 
think
that Simon Willison wrote a javascript function like that as well, 
though
I can't find a link.

also, if you still find it a problem to use that function, you can use 
the following one instead!!

~~~~~~~~~
function externalLinks() {
    if(!document.getElementsByTagName) return;
    var anchors = document.getElementsByTagName("a");
    for(var i=0; i<anchors.length; i++) {
        var anchor = anchors[i];
        if(anchor.getAttribute("href") && anchor.getAttribute("rel") == 
"external") {
            anchor.onclick = 
function(){window.open(anchor.getAttribute("href"));return false;};
        }
    }
}
window.onload = externalLinks;
~~~~~~~~~

Err "or if it must stay then implementing the alternative
rel="external" solution posted in a later post." so I was saying if
the target=_new had to stay then I would vote for that solution. :)

Sorry about the confusion.

no problem. also, someone raised the issue to not fiddle with
standards & that they didn't mean validating the data & then
manipulating it via DOM by adding the "target" attribute. so the
function that I gave should satisfy him as well, as using "onclick"
event handler is perfectly within standards & so is using the
javascript "window.open". :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adoption of OpenID
Message-ID: <435A9A32.80705@zenenet.com>

Hey everyone.

Per Podz, it was suggested that I might be able to make a little bit
more noise on the list as opposed to the support forum.

Having said that, crossposted from http://wordpress.org/support/topic/47536
__________________________________

Based off the searchs, looks like this hasn't been an incredibly often
discussed topic.

First off, yes, I am well aware of
http://www.scatmania.org/archives/2005/08/06/openid-for-wordpress/ but I
would like to expand the idea to Wordpress Core, Wordpress MU, and
(subsequently) wordpress.com

It's really great that I can signup at LiveJournal, and talk to my
friends there, and they'll definitively know it's me by my user.
Then it's great to sign up at DeadJournal and do the same.
Then MySpace, then Xanga, oh, and let's not forget to sign up for a
TypeKey identity so the spam crazy MT users will actually recieve my
comments, and on and on and on.

This opens up the known problems:
Lost username/password.
Shared passwords everywhere (in many cases).
Taken usernames/frustrated users.
Privacy concerns, and the list goes on.

My key suggestions are for:
1) OpenID support to be professionally integrated into CORE Wordpress.
There's a lot of blogs I come across, even more so thanks to Google
BlogSearch. And I don't like leaving anonymous comments, and I don't
like registering places JUST to comment (probably once!).
2) OpenIDs to be given to ALL wordpress.com users. Having said this,
that means of course that OpenID has to be integrated into Wordpress MU
as well (duh?).

Upsides:
* NO MORE REGISTRATIONS!
Anyone with a domain and the ability to host a 2K HTML file can have an
OpenID at their own domain, without having to set up an OpenID server.
How? By delegating their ID out to another OpenID server.

For now, vxjasonxv.com is delegated to LiveJournal, because I have an
account there (and they adopted it... because, well, the founder of LJ
created OpenID!)
For example, this is in my index.html page.
<html>
<head>
<title>My Homepage</title>
<link rel="openid.server"
href="http://www.livejournal.com/openid/server.bml" />
<link rel="openid.delegate" href="http://vxjasonxv.livejournal.com/" />
</head>
<body>
...

* One Account, One Password, so many sites.
Password authentication is done by taking you back to your OpenID server
with two steps:
1) Ensuring you're logged in. And prompting you to log in if you're not.
2) Confirming that you wish to send your identity to the site requesting it.

The absolute most important part is that you DO NOT GIVE YOUR OPENID
PASSWORD ON A SITE OTHER THAN YOUR OPENID SERVER.
They don't need your authentication information, only your identity
information that your OpenID server will send to them.

If Wordpress would allow me to use this on my own domain, for myself,
and not 'delegated around the web', I would be using Wordpress 100% of
the time IN A HEARTBEAT.

I don't already only because PHP support of OpenID is not 100% there.
Videntity.org provides libs, but not the page construction to communicate.
Scatman's implementation needs some touchups and additional features to
manage your own identity on external sites (I think).

I would REALLY like to see this more widely adopted.

For more information you can see;
The OpenID Homepage < http://openid.net >
Videntity.org (a openid account/social networking site) <
http://videntity.org >
My Original OpenID Rant (@LiveJournal) <
http://vxjasonxv.livejournal.com/448635.html >
My videntity OpenID profile < http://videntity.org/profile/vxjasonxv.com >

The usual way to do these things is for someone to come up with working 
code first :)

Amit, I'll be satisfied when people stop trying to make their external
links open new windows/tabs on my computer. The only good excuse for
forcing open a new window, IMO, is to facilitate the use of an
internal web app. IMO.

Standards is one thing, polite behaviour is something else... most
users I know hate it when sites spawn new browser windows for general
links.  I think new windows should only be used for small images, help
boxes, or similar things where it would be nice to have access to both
the original page and the new page.  In all other situations, I want
to decide.

And please note that the validators simply check the syntax of your
(X)HTML --- they generally cannot advice you as to what makes a good
webpage.  So just because it's valid syntax, it doesn't mean that it
is a good idea.

It's like saying that all C code is good as long as the compiler
accepts it --- everybody who has coded C would know that there's a big
difference between good and bad code, even if both compile.

There already is working code.  See the link to Scatman Dan's blog ;).

I have been here before:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001428.html

As I understand it, there are database changes between 1.5.2 and the 
next version. For this reason, once you have upgraded, then you are 
stuck. Not a word many here will like, but it's a word people will use.

So far when releases have happened, it's been a devblog post with words 
like "quicker" "more secure" "more features" and there might be a link 
to a changelog.
Please can we have much more info about the next version including 
warnings about the lack of reverse compatibility ? If someone starts 
flipping out at the admin screens (sorry, 'when') all we can say is 
words along the lines of "It'll grow on you". If this product is 
considered to be significantly different to the current one - regardless 
of whether it is better or not in some respects - then surely there is a 
duty to tell users in detail about what the consequences are. It's not 
enough to say "just like wordpress.com" (because it will not be).

I'm absolutely certain this is going to fall on deaf ears, and the least 
time I posted it was pretty much ignored too.

Podz, I would happily submit a patch adding some language to the upgrade script:
"We're sure you'll be happy with the upgraded version of WordPress but
we feel obligated to tell you that the upgrade is irreversible. Please
back up your database and files before continuing."

This language will probably bring even more questions to the forum,
but they will at least questions rather than complaints. How do you
like this suggestion?

I - like many people on this list I'm sure - look after a number of 
installs for people. I installed 1.6 recently in response to a question 
from one of those people. 3 others have seen that install and played 
with it. Not one will be upgrading right now.
They dislike the admin screen, the FAT and that is not outweighed by 
other factors. If someone does not have multiple users, then the 
altering of that part of the code means nothing to them.
The addition of the image uploading might assist one of those 4, but the 
other 3 people ? They still will not upgrade because the end result - 
words on a screen - is made worse by the admin changes. They do not like 
"the experience". The admin screen has not really changed since 1.0.1 - 
this a huge departure.

The admin screen was posted about before and IIRC Skippy posted an 
alternative - that thread was ignored and died.

There are users - not geeks, not coders, just regular people - who may 
not like what appears after clicking "Upgrade" - and given that those 
people have been WP users and supporters, I do not see it as being a Bad 
Thing to be honest and open about what has changed.

(And while I'm on about the Admin - why can't the excerpt be above the 
post area ? It comes first ?)

Podz, I'd like to know more specifically what bothers these people
about 1.6. This is a bit too vague for anyone to do anything about it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Developing plug-in for WP
Message-ID: <64c81f720510222242y61e23e0dn668d61878abe5da1@mail.gmail.com>

I am developing a plugin to export SIOC meta-information [1] from a
WordPress blog.
This plugin would allow an RDF crawler to collect metadata about the
site and posts on it.

You may find the current version of the code at:
http://rdfs.org/sioc/wordpress

However, there is one issue that I hope to find help on this list:
The exporter currently is a standalone "drop-in" file and it works ok.
(Apart from being a beta)
But it is not a plugin and it would be nicer towards users if they
could just install the plugin.

Could you suggest how to convert the exporter into a WP plugin (if possible)?

Requirements:
 - it needs to be accessible at a new URL, separate from regular WP
urls (hence, i don't see how action hooks could help)
 - it needs to accept queries in the URL parameters (might be good to
use rewriting to make nice URLs later on)

[1] http://rdfs.org/sioc/

Thanks in advance,
Uldis Bojars

CaptSolo: As a plugin, your script would be able to add wp-rewrite
rules to catch the requests, then hook into template_redirect to start
your RDF output.

Andy

With the use of rel="external" (that by the way is 150% standard and 
any buzzword compliant) and a DOM manipulation using javascript :

- There is absolutely no problem with browsers not supporting 
javascript and/or with Javascript deactivated
- It will be very easy to provide the sidebar with a button "links in 
external or same window" (the click would set a global JS variable 
and the function I and other provided can be set inside a IF a switch)

As a user I think the problem is far less in people forcing you to 
make their external links in a new window or not than these people 
using for their website a software that takes decisions for them :-)

My two cents

Has anyone considered putting up a live, public demo of the new release
after each RC milestone is reached?  Then, announce it for feedback from the
community.

Yes, it opens a huge can of worms, but it can let devs know if they are
heading down a potentially problematic path.  It does not mean devs need to
accommodate every concern.  But, if 90% of the community raises an alarm, it
might be worth listening to.

This is a way to give folks a preview without their having to download and
install it, which as Podz indicates most do not do anyway.

If you want to preview most features of WP 1.6 then grab yourself the 
Flock browser and sign up on http://wordpress.com/ !
It's not quite WP 1.6 - there are more restrictions, neccessarily so, 
but it will certainly give you a feel for the Write screen.
There's a very handy "Feedback" button which sends a message to the 
developers too!

Doug,
It appears that the devs aren't interested in what the element of the
community that complains have to say. They will always argue that the
silent majority must be happy otherwise they'd be complaining.
They will argue that all the WordPress.com users (and there are
probably 1000's now) are happy.

I was going to mention that you can turn it off, but that option no
longer puts the old interface back.
I also notice that while the whole interface is a nightmare to use
with just the keyboard, the new image thingy is completelyb useless
without a mouse.

Maybe there will be a fork of the code which replaces the old
interface. With any luck it may even be doable as a plugin.

Dear friends,

Last night I've just added some features to WP1.6 function. I added some
tags to wp_get_archives like *feed* & *feed_image* just like wp_list_cats,
now if you use those tags and RSS link will apear after Monthly, Daily &
weekly archives , after 3 hours of coding and finishing the job , I thought
is it really neccessary ? Should I submit the code to wordpress trac?

PS. There's aboolutley no bug in new functions and they work well.

I have asked for specific feedback from some people, but what I 
suggested was that people be warned - that's all. Advised that there are 
a LOT of changes. Most people don't care about the code and how 
streamlined it is, how many queries have been eliminated etc etc etc. 
They do care about the UI - and in 1.6 the two areas most used have been 
totally remade with no way at all of reverting that change.

This list is frequented by those that 'do' code, who like all the shiny 
stuff, who want to get all the latest tricks - the forums are used by 
people who will say "How do I do this ?" "Where has xxx gone ?" - do you 
know how tedious it's going to be to trot out the same explanations time 
after time after time ? (Cue response: write the docs then.)

For people who have been with WP, you are not just improving the code, 
you are stripping the backend, changing not only it's makeup but 
everything else about it. You may be familiar with it - the average 
blogger is not - and they will be the ones seeking help. Again.

I want the coders to make forum life easier. Given that no-one I've so 
far dealt with says "Look at that Write screen, it's just SO intuitive" 
I will not be holding my breath.

Comprehensive feeds, such as the ones you describe, can be useful for what we
have come to know as Google Sitemap. The input XML might soon be supported by
other search engines too (if not already so).

Having said that, there is an existing implementation of XML sitemaps for
WordPress. It must be lying about somewhere as it was announced in this list
only days after Google Sitemaps had been introduced.

Whether large-scale feeds will ever be helpful to human readers, I 
doubt it with
passion. It's merely a bot/harvester element.

Best Wishes,

Roy

well, I agree that its annoying sometimes when all links start opening 
in a
new tab, but then, IMHO, the links to other sites should open in a new
window as it makes the like of common Joe user easier as he still has 
that
old site opened as he might not know how to come back to if the link
opened in the same window & then he clicked a few more links as well. 
You
are forgetting on thing, things are designed keeping the kind of people 
that
will be using them most & the number of dumb people is quite higher than
those of knowledgeable ones!! these are the people who sometimes don't
know how to open a link in a new window or tab!!

As a person who runs a site using _new, I do it for the masses.  I myself usually ctrl-click links to open them into another tab in FF, so that I don't "lose my place" when browsing sites/articles.

I'd definitely give preferential treatment to the site >owner< on this thing -- if there are multiple ways to implement, let the owner choose which to use, or to not use it at all.

Shouldn't step 1 of the how to upgrade guide be to backup both your
files and your database so there is a way back if need be? How about
putting some verbiage on the first upgrade step to that effect with
links to appropriate resouces?

I've asked for such links and directions before. None were forthcoming.
This is what we have:

"Upgrading from any previous WordPress to 1.5:
    1. Delete your old WP files, saving ones you've modified
    2. Upload the new files
    3. Point your browser to /wp-admin/upgrade.php
    4. You wanted more, perhaps? That's it!"

There are people on this list who get mad at ONE email being posted just 
THREE times.
Write screen complete changed.
Users changed completely.
Uploading and images changed
WYSIWYG introduced

Want to help in the forums ? Or want to help here so our workload is less ?

I just noticed the above is - unless you are using 1.5 already - 
/completely wrong/ and if you are using 1.5 anyway, you don't need to 
run upgrade.

I have a wordpress.com account.    And, I among of the folks who runs his
own server and can/will download 1.6 myself for testing purposes.  So, don't
take my comments to be those of a whiny end-user.

I raise this issue because I've been a user of OSS for a long time and have
seen lots of projects rise and then fall very hard because they ignore their
install base in favor of the personal whims of devs. I am not saying that is
happening to WP ... yet, but I am suggesting ways to make sure that it does
not happen.

I love WP.  I use it as the back bone of about 10 sites and should see it
grow into another 10 my mid-2006. So, take the advice or dismiss it out of
hand.  If WP stumbles and falls, the OSS dev environment will grow a bigger,
better replacement with a clean and simple migration UI to grab former WP
users.  This much I know from experience.

I don't recall if a decision was reached in previous conversations, but 
wasn't there talk of including backup functionality either baked in the 
core or as a plugin with 1.6?

Its nice to have instructions with step one reading: "Backup your 
database" but wouldn't it be great to just have a simple "Push this 
button to backup"?

In 1.5 that's probably the easiest way, but in 1.6 we've encapsulated 
this in a function (wp_create_user) that should make your life easier.

I think we should sit this one out and let OpenID, Ping Identity, 
Identity Commons, Sxip, Passport, Yahoo user API, and LID duke it out 
for a little while. OpenID addresses a problem that is academically 
interesting, and I mostly like the implementation, but it's not 
something people have been saying is something they have to deal with.

I'm happy to continue expanding our plugin API to allow plugin authors 
to experiment with these different systems, but I think it's too early 
to make a commitment to any of them in the core, as it's a rapidly 
evolving space.

In the redesign of wordpress.org screenshots are emphasized a lot more, 
so people should know that things have changed a lot going in if they're 
old WP users.

I believe the thinking there was that it's hard to summarize something 
before you've written it.

I wouldn't say they're all happy. I would also say that it's pretty 
widely regarded that especially in open source the most vocal people 
aren't always representative of most users (though sometimes they are). 
However I wouldn't use that as a blanket dismissal of everyone who 
complains, that'd be silly.

What's nice about WordPress.com, and why I think it's going to have a 
major impact on the usability of WP, is:

* We can observe what people DO in addition to what they say
* The users tend to be less savvy
* It's very easy to provide instant feedback

If it's not doable as a plugin, I'd welcome any submissions to extend 
the hooks to make it possible.

WordPress.com shares 95% of the UI with WP and we get a ton of feedback 
on it, so I think this part is mostly covered.

That's the ever-elusive XML backup/restore, which isn't looking like 
it's going to make this release.

right on. I've come across just 1-2 WP powered blogs that require
you to signup to comment on them & frankly I didn't bother to
comment on them. There are some pretty good anti-spam solutions
available for WordPress so registration is not required & if you don't
know, this whole process of registration has been thwarted quite a
lot by bugmenot.com
registration is for those loosers running MT which can't have anything
like SK2 to battle out the spam.

didn't you know, there was .NET Passport earlier which fell on its face,
then SixApart came out brandishing TypeKey & raving about it as if it
was a really innovative thing & best after sliced bread!! what happened?
it didn't saw the sunset, fell before it could fly, no implemented on 
fairly
less blogs & on SixApart network only!!

I agree, though its nothing new, its interesting but we don't require 
it.
it'll be good if it could be implemented on things other than commenting
on blogs, on a broad scale as Passport was meant to be. Only then it
can be of any benefit IMHO.

Subject: [wp-hackers] improving the_excerpt()
Message-ID: <006201c5d809$165c9a40$57ebd4cb@unicorn>

another thing that I just remembered. the current the_excerpt() strips 
out HTML tags & then creates a summary of the post to be displayed if 
none is specified. Now that creates quite a bit of problem for some 
people(including myself) who use any of the code hiliting plugins etc. 
since then the code looks like plain text & a bit ugly. Now, what I was 
asking is, has it been taken care of? I mean an excerpt created without 
ripping out the HTML tags? I know this will be a bit difficult & tricky, 
but then, thats what our job is, some RegEx checks would have to be made 
to be sure of cutting the text on the point where the the last opened 
tag is closed.

any suggestions?

I wish you wouldn't pontificate on things about which you have no clue.

Then there is a value in turning the SIOC exporter into a plugin.

But what would happen in the case if the server does not have rewrite
enabled? Then instead of a nice, short URL (like
http://blog_url/wp-sioc.php now) the RDF output would be located at
somewhere deep at, e.g.,
http://blog_url/wp-content/plugins/wp-sioc.php.

Can you tell if there is a significant percentage of WordPress blogs
that do not have the rewriting capability and if it is worthwhile
worrying about that?

Expecting people to make the connection that wordpress.org has been 
redesigned to coincide with a re-design of the WordPress product which 
they download is probably not the best course of action.

Sure, people can look at the screenshots, but since the admin interface 
has not significantly changed all year, most people will likely breeze 
past all the art to get to the download.

Podz's suggestion is a good one.  I suggest an even more radical option: 
an explanatory paragraph, with a checkbox that says "I understand". 
This will go a long way toward making sure that people are (as) fully 
aware of the implications of the upgrade (as we can make them).

I would be happy to donate my WP-DB Backup code to the WordPress core, 
or see it included as a default plugin bundled with the download.

It's not perfect, but it seems to work for the overwhelming majority of 
people who try it (and as such, I consider it's success rate to be about 
on par with WordPress itself).

I will write the upgrade docs that are needed.
Problem is that they won't be 1-2-3.
You cannot cover what needs to be done in one small paragraph and I'd 
rather do it once and properly in my time than have to rush one out when 
the complaints come in.
If you have written or are writing such docs for the next WP release, 
say so now please so there is no duplication of work.

Oops, I was referring to WP 1.6, in which WordPress handles rewrite
internally. You might do better to keep your drop-in file model.

This discussion is very strange.
Yes, there have been a lot of changes to the admin in 1.6, and not 
everyone fancies them.

Most of the UI changes are reversable, though, it's just that nobody has 
written a plugin to reverse them yet.  All you should need to do is 
prevent sack.js, fat.js, and dbx.js from being included, and set the 
WYSI editor to "off" and you've mostly got the old interface.  I can't 
imagine it's more than 30 minutes of coding, and can all be done inside 
a plugin.

If warning current users that there are radical changes to the admin UI 
is something we're inclined toward, then I don't think it's reasonable 
to expect anyone to post "Don't download WordPress 1.6 because you won't 
like the admin" on the WordPress.org download page.

What would be useful is a clear suggestion of what *should* appear on 
the WordPress site to inform users of the changes that will occur when 
they upgrade, both in the interface and the data structures.

I suggest that complaints about features of the WYSI that don't work 
(I've seen a few myself) and any other verifiable/reproducible issues go 
into Trac so that the 1.7 release can include the fixes, if not 1.6.  A 
list of plugins and the version numbers that break after upgrading to 
1.6 should go into Codex.  If we can otherwise better inform upgraders 
of what will affect them upon upgrading, we should do so.

I tested out 1.6 alpha and I noticed while making permalinks the

RewriteRule . /index.php

I didn't know you could do that in Apache/PHP.

The rewrite rule you mention matches anything that is not emptystring 
and forwards it to WordPress' index.php.

Rules prior to that one cause that rule to execute only if the file or 
directory that is requested doesn't physically exist.  So if you have a 
file called "kumquat.php" in your web root and someone makes a request 
for it, then they receive it.  But if someone makes a request for 
kumquat.php and the file isn't present, then the request is redirected 
toward WordPress' index.php.

 From there, the WP_Rewrite class takes over.  This class is located in 
/wp-includes/classes.php

As I said in the most recent #meetup, I'm convinced that the only reason 
that the WP_Rewrite class works is because Ryan sacrifices small animals 
daily on its behalf.  The loa then possess him and use his fingers to 
type.  Just when I figure out what this class is doing, my brain spasms 
and I must imbibe enough alcohol to forget what I know.

My advice is to forget what you have seen here, and mention it to no 
one.  I'm likely to be hit by a bus on my way home tomorrow for 
revealing even this much to you.

I'm kidding, of course.  Explore away!

Yes, there are ways in 1.5 also to detect if rewrite rules are enabled
and, if so, add your rules to those also. Although I'm not totally
opposed making something like this a drop-in file, most people would
rather it be in the plugins directory. There are also other ways for
you to make the URI shorter, using things such as $_GET variables and
having your plugin output what it needs then die before themes are
run, that sort of stuff.

We need a "What's New in WordPress 1.6" document similar to "What's New
in Gnome".  People love these things.

http://www.gnome.org/start/2.10/notes/rnwhatsnew.html

The doc should follow 1.6 development and be updated as needed.  Once
1.6 is ready for release, "What's New" can become part of the release
notes.

Matt, Owen, Donncha, Andy, and I have written quite a bit about 1.6 on
our blogs.  Those posts could be used to seed "What's New".

Kai: IIUC, WP 1.6 uses mod_rewrite to send all unmatched requests to
index.php, complete with the original request URI.

WP then builds an array of expressions, sends it through a filter and
then tests the rules against the request URI. When it finds a match,
it sends the parts of the URI on as query vars, e.g. year, month, day,
post name.

One of the very nice things about this is that WP doesn't need to
update .htaccess every time the rewrite rules change. The rules are
generated dynamically, so a plugin can easily add any new rules in a
filter. The plugin doesn't have to mess with .htaccess.

Now, if you're ever going to understand WP-Rewrite, you're going to
have to dig into the code. Start by finding a way to make WP print the
array of rules.

Actually, no, that's not right. Start by walking to the market and
buying three live chickens. ;-)

Thanks roy , but finally should I try to add the changes to WP 1.6?

Another problem! How can I submit the changes ? through trac? or through
SVN?

+1 for this idea.  I think this will be great communication tool for those
who do not follow dev daily, or even weekly.

To clarify my previous post, I think that the folks that do the majority of
the work can and should drive the direction of the project.  I've been down
the "try to please everyone, but please no one" path on other OSS projects.

Matt says that 1.6 will look a lot like WordPress.com.  If WP.com will roll
out new functionality, then great.  I think that will generate lots of
useful feedback.  The only thing I'd add is a subdomain called something
like testdrive.wordpress.com.  This would be a place where folks could test
out wordpress.com without having to have an invite.  Maybe goes against the
google-like coolness of the invite, not sure.

Finally, Owen mentioned that most of the UI changes would be reversible via
a relative simple plug-in.  How hard would it be to bake that change in and
add it as an option on the General options tab?  Something like this ...

Which user interface do you prefer?  [] Classic  [] Next-Gen

Keep up the good work everyone.  Settling into my new house this next couple
of weeks.  After that, I hope to actually start contributing code for
consideration ... rather than just opinions! :D

For changes to be committed by yourself, I suspect there is no way around the
need for privileges. If anybody could commit changes without supervision, we
would be in a sordid chaos.

Try to list a few compelling reasons in Trac, which may persuade the 
developers
to propagate your submission to the trunk, rather than treating it as a
plug-in.

Best Wishes,

Roy

I can't believe people are still having this discussion in 2005!

For the last 5+ years, the major graphical browsers, the ones used by 
probably 99% of the web using population uses, has had the ability to 
open a link in a new window by use of a modifier key pressed when 
clicking a link, or by use of a contextual-menu, or by setting some 
preference in a browser.

Let the user decide, they have the power. Why clutter up your site with 
functionality the browser already provides?

Bill,

What sort of information and what would be the side-effect of having those
cookies deleted from a user's browser? Would they notice or need to care?
Would your plugin just re-create the cookie with whatever information it
need to store? How would you guess what was the previous information?

What happens if a person has disabling setting cookies in their browser?

Just a few questions for you to answer before you proceed..:)

I definitely agree with Ryan on this. Concerning the "not much is needed to
get the old interface back" by Owen Winkler, are there hooks in place to
turn that off with a plugin, or does one need to edit files?

If you read the last post by owen, you'll see he's already made a
plugin to put things back to normal.

Sorry for that, it gets a bit difficult wading through a lot of e-mails,
even with the Gmail Conversation-style threading.

Comments like this are rude and unproductive. Don't make things
personal, and if you're going to criticize someone else's actions, at
least make the effort to provide something constructive.

This debate has already resulted in useful commentary, Owen's plugin,
and the overall improvement of WordPress. You have added nothing.

Basically I was planning on using the session as a clipboard for 
cut/copy/paste functionality of objects. Since it's a clipboard, a house 
cleaning of the session cookie isn't a big deal. Since it's for the 
admin interface of the plugin, I'm not that worried about cookies being 
disabled either. 1) Sessions can be supported without cookies (although 
how well that would work with WP would have to be tried), 2) the 
functionality lost is minimal. I wrote  a test plugin that stored values 
in the session and it appeared to work, however, there were posts on the 
support forum indicating that it could be a problem. I thought I'd check 
here.

I know what you're trying to accomplish, Graeme, but you're coming off like
the person you're chastizing. Don't feed the trolls!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll -- let him have his empty lunch
and be done with it. Statements such as Jefte's are meant to incite a flame
war.

So that's enough being off-topic. Back on-topic, I would think making
available the changes in several different ways would be useful: 1) in a
text file included with the WordPress install ... 2) on the
WordPress.orgwebsite ... 3) as part of the installation text

I'm asking only because it may (probably will) be asked in the forums.
Does this application have any consequences at all for people, 
especially those that use private posts / user levels etc.
Can every possible fear be allayed ?

Doesn't Google Accelerator 'click on every link' to prefetch all pages
linked from the current one?
i.e. doesn't this run the risk of deleting a user, submitting a blank
post, changing the theme, enabling/disabling plugins, or something else
retardedly retarded?

Why not?

1. Delete old files, save wp-content.
2. Upload new files, making sure not to overwrite wp-content
3. Run wp-admin/upgrade.php

Have I missed something?

Yup :)

So far the languages directory is .. ? I do not use it, so I assume that 
if wp-whatever is deleted, so it a lot of work. I asked about this ages 
ago - what was/is the state of play ?

Old files - people need that spelling out.

People skip (1) then screw things up, post to the forums, swear blind 
they did it right, make noises ...

The above does not take account of version skipping - you cannot go to 
1.6 from b2, or 1.0.1, or 1.2 each of which needs explaining.

Lowest common denominator - people who are worried about their blog, 
need lots of reassurance and who may never have done this before 
(fantastico has a lot to answer for here, that and webhosts).

Believe me, if I didn't think it was needed, I wouldn't do it. And as I 
have said before, I'm not looking at this from someone who bleeds 
commandline code or can code anything anywhere. There is an unmet need 
for this - and Codex doesn't hit the spot for a lot of people.

Is there something that could be done to
http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress so that it "does hit the
spot"?

Or should we not direct people to that page?

Sorry this is probably more a [wp-docs] issue but the thread is here.

Unless someone can come up with a better way of laying out the pages, 
probably not. It almost needs numbered tables. I've said before that 
Codex is too 'busy' for people that are unfamiliar with not just Codex 
but the process they are doing as well. If you take this page:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Resetting_Your_Password#Through_phpMyAdmin
and compare to
http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/phpmyadmin/
then mine does not have other windows opening on top of what someone is 
trying to read for instance.

Codex is a good resource, but experience in the forums
Upgrade 1.5 > 1.5.1
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/33189
7 pages @ 30 posts/page

Upgrade to 1.5.2
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/41866
4 pages
suggests that the guides we have are not useful enough (there are many 
many other upgrade threads) and people are still upgrading from much 
earlier versions and we need to cater to those people.

Really?  I mean, I expect that b2->1.6 wouldn't work, but 1.0.1 or 1.2?

What extra steps need to take place to perform these upgrades?  Are we 
talking about templates/themes?  I'm curious, not skeptical.

/*
It's also worthwhile to note (this is probably better recorded in Trac, 
but it's on my mind right now) that upgrading very large databases from 
1.2 to 1.5 doesn't always work.  There is a very inefficient section of 
the upgrade code that does a query for every post and comment to remove 
slashed quotes.  On large databases this section easily times out.  The 
same would be true for an upgrade to 1.6 from 1.2.

I know a lot of effort has been made to produce instructions for 
commonly-requested WordPress functions, but don't these very basic 
things (installing, upgrading) merit specific, directed, illustrated, 
hand-holding documentation, perhaps also without the burden of the Codex 
navigation?  Certainly, the download page should link to such a set of 
instructions, and such a set of instructions could introduce the Codex 
resource upon completion.

There are several instances in WP whereby get requests contain side-effects
such as deleting posts. Goes without saying that GWA will be very bad in
these instances.

And I quoth:

 Google Web Accelerator only prefetches links that should have no side
effects. According to the HTTP 1.1 specification, the GET method is
defined as a Safe Method which "SHOULD NOT have the significance of
taking an action other than retrieval." In practice, Google Web
Accelerator does not prefetch links which have query parameters (i.e.
have a "?" in the URL) and encrypted pages (i.e. URL starting with
https://).

For the time being, this means that it looks like for now we don't
need to worry about such a thing, but this now raises the question of
whether we should actually comply with HTTP 1.1 in this manner, and if
os, how would we go about doing it?

 From wordpress.org: "WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal 
publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and 
usability."

I think complying with HTTP 1.1 fits under "web standards" as well as 
"usability" in this case...

maybe the spec writers smoke pot? I mean... I can name no site that tracks
visitors using the POST method. and many sites, such as amazon, change the
returned content based on past user interactions... talk about a carnage if
google preloads every possible GET request with fancy urls around. there
would be no more machine learning except on evil google's servers, heh.

one way to comply without loosing the -- at times -- elegance of GET is to
redirect using a GET request once the POST occurred successfully. This
allows the user to click the back button as he normally would, at times
where the bulkiness of a POST request gives the impression of being
irrelevant (e.g. after switching themes). I recall WP does this already at
some places, too.

So far, and correct me if I'm wrong:
- password issues are non-starters
- if GWA does not follow query links then index.php/?p= people will have 
no luck ?
- bandwidth may/will increase but there are no other real issues.

I think there's a misunderstanding of the spec. There's nothing wrong with
canging the returned content. That's a given. The key thing is that GET
requests are idempotent i.e. a single execution of the entire sequence
always yields a result that is not changed by a reexecution of all, or part,
of that sequence. Packaging a delete in a get request is clearly not
idempotent.

nope... tracking and analyzing user interactions to change the content that
is returned is not idempotent either. if you hit reload, you're --
technically -- revisiting the page later in time. part or all of your site
can have mutated in the meanwhile, if only because it got a few thousand
hits inbetween your two hits. You could and do get a different page.

You can verify this experimentally by refreshing on a site that is full of
ads. Among other reasons, ad servers track users to ensure that ads are not
displayed to the same user more than a few times.

That's exactly it. GET requests are fine, as long as they don't commit
any changes to the server. That means tailoring your response to the
GET query vars isn't misuse; it's exactly what the spec says GET is
for. However, changing things, like deleting posts/comments is advised
against.

However, it's worth pointing out that what we're doing isn't contrary
to the spec. It says SHOULD NOT, not MUST NOT. This has been discussed
over and over again on this list and the bottom line is that GET is
easier. Committal GETs are actually quite common; we're not the only
people doing this.

Jason,

The "new" GWA is not announcing itself in the header, thus the 403 
method won't work and the problem is more serious than might be assumed 
based on a read of the document you so thoughtfully referenced. It seems 
Google has not updated that webpage in some time.

I was referring to the worry about GWA prefetching links like
index.php?action=delete&id=123, which was unfounded as GWA won't
prefetch those.

Also shouldn't those authenticated pages have no cahce headers set in
the first place anyway?

     3.1.3 Side-effects do not Imply Unsafe Interactions

     Some user interactions cause side effects (i.e., they change the
     state of the server) but are safe interactions. When a server is
     configured to count and display the number of visitors to a
     site, each user interaction increments a counter. Users do not
     commit themselves to anything through this sort of interaction,
     so it is safe.

Anyone else notice that the only options displayed under Options are the
default ones, i.e., the sub div isn't being displayed?  You can still
navigate to the .php files themselves (as long as you remember what
they're called) but you can't get to 'em by default.

Is this happening for anyone else, or is it just my installs (4 of 'em)

issues. Please use wp-testers for the same.

Just a friendly reminder, is all :)

There should be greater fear among users who have installed spyware or
'legitimate spyware' such as toolbars that retain page history and 
'call home'.

I recently discovered that the Alexa/A9/Amazon toolbar leads to fetching of
potentially any page which was ever viewed by the Web surfer. I happened to
delete a so-called hidden page and noticed a 404 from Alexa. Let us not forget
that the Web Archive (Wayback Machine) is run by that same alliance.

The last thing you want is hidden pages in cache or even in SE indices. I once
bumped upon the entire Palm data of an MIT sysadmin and informed him
immediately (I mirror my data on some Webspace too). Thus, protected post and
such _must_ be password-protected or cookie-dependent, in which case 
Google Web
Accelerator can never ever touch them.

I tried to go from b2 to 1.5x recently and it didn't work.

Could someone please register the wp-testers list (and all other
WordPress lists for that matter) with Gmane?

At the moment it's only this list which is there:

  http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wordpress.devel

Having the other lists there too would be very nice since I find it
much more convenient to read mailinglists through Gmane.  (And I have
a strange problem where the SMTP server of my ISP silently drops mails
I send to SF... see http://mgeisler.net/im-bad-im-a-dynamic-user/ if
you're interested.  This basically means that I'm very dependent on
this news-to-mail gateway.)

I want to start versioning the DB.  This will avoid running the deslash
code unless we are really upgrading from 1.2.x or older.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1791

This won't help upgrades from 1.2.x, but at least we won't suck when
upgrading from 1.5.x and later.

I'd also recommend a look at the WP DB-Manager available at

pressed. Forget that, they don't even know or realise that they can

That script doesn't integrate well with the admin and uses passthru() 
calls to execute shell commands on the server, which is not recommended 
since it doesn't work on every server.

In what way do you suppose that the options in that script are better 
organized than those in Skippy's backup plugin?  For novice users, 
wp-db-backup is much more succinct, and doesn't allow them to execute 
arbitrary (therefore possibly corrosive) queries against their database.

I take personal offense to the idea that a robust backup script is not 
hard to implement.

In the context of most blogs, a full backup is the only thing worth
pursuing.  Incremental backups, or backups of specific tables, are
inappropriate:

If you know you'll only need to restore one table (because you're
fiddling with a new plugin, for example), then you arguably ought to use
the right tool for the job (phpMyAdmin or command-line mysql tools).
Any automated or one-click backup thingie should be for disaster
recovery purposes.  "Features" in a DR system are useless: you want to
make sure you've got all your data and nothing else.

The possible exceptions to the above are people who know well what
they're doing, and people who have massive amounts of data in their
database (like the one Podz mentioned recently).  For these people,
better tools for the job exist.

If it were easy, it would have been done long ago.

Owen _substantially_ contributed to WP-DB Backup to make it what it is
today.  It is a success in no small way because of his contributions.
Thanks again, Owen.

I still get emails from people with problems.  Most of them seem to
result from faulty detection of gzip support on the host server.

My code is available under the GPL.  If anyone thinks they can make a
better backup system for WordPress, I encourage you to do so.  Feel free
to use as much of WP-DB Backup as you need to succeed.

yes, it uses passthru() but I didn't know it doesn't work with every 
Linux/Unix
server, since I've it running on 2 Linux servers & worked fine at first 
attempt,
no problems at all.

I'm not comparing the two plugins, both work well for me & I use both of 
them
on different blogs. what I meant when I suggested a look at that hack 
was that
in Skippy's plugin, everything's on one page, while in that hack, 
different
functions were on different tabs & a bit more organised. Makes the 
novice user
feel comfortable when he sees all the options at top in the sub-menu 
instead of
scrolling down for different options.

Its really a personal preference I'd say, but then, I didn't say that we 
need to do
that, its just that it looked better to me & I suggested a look at it.

Please excuse my somewhat limited linguistic skills but I don't 
understand
you!! why is it a personal offense to you when said that its not hard to
implement? I don't know about Skippy's plugin but that hack backs up all 
of
the database with the "mysqldump". what's hard in that? yes ofcourse a
compatibility check has to be done whether the operating system & PHP
(for older versions?) will support it properly or not.

Partly by the very fact that you're can't rely on passthru and thus
mysqldump; partly because, as a developer you should be thinking of the
means as well as the ends i.e. different delivery methods (email, download
etc), large table sizes (and thus execution time), progress indicator for
multiple tables, backup of core and optional tables... I could go on.

Skippy/Owen have done a fabulous job with their plugin and their efforts
shouldn't be taken lightly.

Surely it cannot be the responsibility of WordPress to teach those
users how to use their browsers?

The fault lies with the browsers (and the users who could read the
fine manuals that comes with all browsers).

This is disingenous, as you're well aware. Modern, usable applications 
do not require manuals to be read. Nobody reads manuals unless they 
absolutely need to.

Anyway. WP currently lets you open new windows, but in a noncompliant 
manner for some DTDs. The choices are to:

a) Let it be; keep using the HTML attribute to open links in new 
windows, letting people who declare an incompatible DTD be invalid.
b) Update the behavior to a js solution using the rel attribute, or a class.
c) Remove the functionality altogether from the link manager.

People arguing that it's not a good thing at all should clarify their 
position to one of the above proposals (or one I've overlooked).

Yes, I've been very fortunate for the last few years. ;)

It's not so much 'dumb' as ignorant. I suppose we need to educate people 
in this respect. I'd prefer telling people about a useful feature over 
catering to their ignorance. Still, being a champion of the user, I want 
to give them the choice of how to open new windows, not restrict that 
choice. Time to go write a post about this I guess.

Here's my code, also GPL'd, use it if you want. Works well on *nix 
systems where you can run it as a cron job and have enough access to 
actually do things:

-----------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

DT=`date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`

mysqldump -u myname -pmypasswd wordpressdb > 
/home/myname/backups/wordpressdb-$DT.dump

gzip /home/myname/backups/wordpressdb-$DT.dump

-----------------------------------------------

It's not perfect, but it works for me. (Note: may not be fit for human 
consumption.)

I really should look at the real WP backup solutions, but I put this one 
in place right after I installed WP. Oh, don't forget to manage your 
backups, less you fill up your disk space. (Though gzipped dumps are 
fairly small in my case.)

There's at least one situation where you need to restrict that choice
: the client who commissions the website says so.
You could argue on and on about "our users simply need to be told to
right-click and Open in New Window" or "users hate new windows!" but
in the end that won't change much things.

So, while it is agreed on that forcing a new window for a link is bad,
there's no benefit in removing that choice in the Links admin area.

I have "subscribed" the polyglots, testers and the docs lists at gmane. It
does not require special privileges to do so, and so you could have done the
same too. No need to now, since I have done so.

They should be available once they have been processed at
gmane.comp.web.wordpress.polyglots|docs|testers

But only for photos? We use uploading extensively for word and PDF

The upload interface on the post screen is for files that are meant to
be attached to posts. Each file so uploaded gets recorded in wp-posts
and becomes the object of a new post, technically called a "subpost,"
so that it can have its own title, description and comments. While
support for many mime types will be added, it was never meant as a
method for uploading unblogged files to your server.

I cannot speak to the removal of general uploading capabilities.

Then why was it developed and released with such functionality?

Time for an 'Upload Unsupported File' plugin?

An upload-anything plugin may be a better way of doing things.

If you mean the file uploading functionality in Strayhorn, I can't
say. When I said "it was never meant..." I was referring to the new
uploading functionality on the 1.6-ALPHA Write pages, which has not
yet been released. Maybe Matt can fill you in on the designs behind
the removal of the Upload page.

> Time for an 'Upload Unsupported File' plugin?

That may be. If it is secure, robust and highly usable (i.e. won't be
a drag to maintain and support) an uploading page might be worth
including in the 1.6 core.

Thank you!  I know I could have done it myself, but I felt that the
list admin should be the one making the choice.  But thanks again, I'm
looking forward to seeing the other lists there!

How about we just let the blog owners specify their own supported file 
extensions like in previous versions?  What, pray tell, was wrong with 
that system?

Also, some way of uploading theme-related files is an oft-requested 
feature among my hosted blogs.  Any notions of adding such a thing, sans 
plugins?

Yes, that would be ideal. I'd hate to do an upgrade and find out I lose 
features. If a feature is a security risk, I'd want a nice summary of 
how to solve that problem, or determine if it is a security risk in my 
specific case.

I am referring to blogged files, just types other than images... our
course manager posts course status reports with attached PDF files,
for instance.

So I guess I am asking: is the old upload feature going completely
away and, if so, will there still be a capability to upload other than
web images and link to them in posts? If not, then that is a loss of
features that kills WP for me (but I'm imagining it isn't so)...

I'm guessing the current Upload options have no effect on the
uploading in the post-composition window.

Message-ID: <99cf7e6f0510261321o79b80255y6be9bd346fe95cdf@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like an easy way to have pages on the same level as the blog
directory when using permalinks.  In other words, I'd have WordPress
in the top-level directory, with pages such as www.example.com/about,
but the blog entries would be under www.example.com/blog, so a typical
blog post might look like www.example.com/blog/2005/10/26/blog-entry .

The problem is that I can't see any way to do that without a lot of
hand-coding of htaccess every time I update the permalink structure
(e.g. every time I add a new page).  Is there an easier way to do this
that I'm missing?

And what is a 'web image' really? Do svg files count? Is it only images? 
what about mpg, mp3, mov, wmv?

I'm working on the inline uploading functions right now and adding
support for such types as we speak. If you'd like to assist me by
compiling a list of mime types with their file extensions and
best-practice XHTML elements, I would really appreciate that.

Nobody said anything was wrong with it, but if you look from the eyes
of the average blogger, that system was severely lacking and had
little true purpose, whereas the capability to upload media into posts
is something that is highly, highly requested. Now, perhaps the old
uploading way should be included also for those who want it, the point
is the new way is an upgrade to an upld feature, not a drop of that
feature. You can still upload files, but like requested, you now
attach those files to posts, etc.

They are up:

http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wordpress.docs
http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wordpress.polyglots

Matt, shall we also have the mailing lists' archives imported? It's a
reasonable way of making the archives backed-up and easily searchable.

It is not easy, and involves quite a few hacks, a modified plugin etc. I
have such a setup going on my website.

If you are game to learn from this, and later produce a page on the Codex
describing how to do it, I can let you sneak a peek at my source :)

I call it, will-share-for-docs :)

Carthik.

Okay, Carthik.  I'm willing to write something for the Codex, provided the 
technique isn't completely obsolete with the release of 1.6.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but can't you do this simply be prefixing
your permalink structure with /blog, and then adding two custom rewrite
rules to redirect /blog to /index.php, and / itself to wherever you want
it to go (which wasn't made clear by the question)?

Fair enough. I am just too lazy to write it up myself.
I have sent you the files off-list.

Doing this will give you archives at /blog/date/title-of-post, but wouldn't
give you a blog, regular-style at /blog/

and then adding two custom rewrite

That would be a loop, I suppose (trying to redirect /blog to / and / to
somewhere else, that is). Besides it is not advisable to have a /index.php
and have a rewriterule for "/" thus expecting index.php to NOT be the index
file for the root directory.

Maybe what you said is just the beginning and there is a good way to do it
with only rewrite rules and a custom permalink structure prefix, but when I
tried to do what I did, my wordpress files, and blog were at
public_html/blog/ and i wanted to have the "Pages" at public_html, and the
blog at public_html/blog, along with all the wordpress "core" files.

I am not known for thinking too straight :P

Okay, the part of that I can't get to work is redirecting / to one of the 
pages, say "home".  How do you do that without getting wacky circular 
results?

RedirectRule ^$ /home/ [QSA,L]
RedirectRule ^blog/?$ /index.php [QSA,L]

No? Alternatively you could specify the Page ID in the query string of
the first rule.

It's also just occurred to me that feeds and things will be in /feed/
rather than /blog/feed/.

Does this discussion belong here?

RewriteRule ^$ /index.php?pagename=home [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^blog/?$ /index.php [QSA,L]

does the trick.

Now I'll write a plugin to put those lines back in after every .htaccess 
update, and I'll be all set.

Thanks for your help, and apologies if this was the wrong list.

This offer still stands. My real appreciation for one complete list of
mime types matched with file extensions and the best way to display
them (or link to them) from XHTML. Any takers?

I agree. what we are discussing is not "whether to force links in new 
window
or not". the original point of this thread was to remove the 
non-complaint
usage of the "target" attribute in the links & instead use a javascript
replacement. so if the user wants any link to open in new window, they 
can
simply choose the new window option as they do now but instead of using
the "target" attribute, WordPress simply tags the link's relation as 
"external"
or something identifiable which can be made to open in new window via
javascript. this way, the author/admin has the option of having links 
opened in
new window or not, its their blog, let them decide!! ;)

Yep. I've developed a function, called XHTMLexcerpt that trims any HTML 
string to X words, closing any open tags after that, appending "..." or 
any string you want if content is longer, and blah blah.

Based on that function I did a plugin, which I cannot send to you 
because it's sleeping at home (and currently I'm at the office).

Please send me a private email to choan.galvez@gmail.com if you are 
interested in receiving the code.

Choan

    Agreed.  This is exactly how I let presentation authors mark a 
link as needing to spawn a new window in S5[1], same 'rel' value and 
some JS.
    I'm not entirely certain that the value of 'external' makes the 
most sense, though.  All 'rel' does is provide a way to define the 
relationship of the target resource to the current resource.  Thus, 
'rel="stylesheet"' means "the document that's the target of this 
'link' is a style sheet for this document". All other pages are 
external to the current page, after all, regardless of whether or not 
the author wants a link to open new window, so they all technically 
have a 'rel="external"'.  Or you could assume that's the default case 
and only mark inter-document links 'rel="internal"' or 'rel="me"' or 
something.
    Similarly, 'rev', which means "the relationship this document has 
to that one", doesn't really work either.  What we're really 
discussing here is a UI behavior (a deeply annoying one, I agree, but 
authors still want it), not an intra-document relationship.  I 
suspect that adding a 'class="newwindow"' or something similar is as 
semantically pure as you could hope to get within the confines of 
XHTML Strict.
    Assuming you were committed to keeping your semantics pure while 
dirtying your UI behavior, of course.

Right. That classname, with some light js to match it (never == a
space-separated value) and convert it to a window-opening link, would
be valuable in the Links UI.

yeah, I wrote a function a few emails back which would make the 
links(<a>)
with a `rel="external"` open in new window using javascript's 
window.open
instead of using "target" attribute. it was tested in IE6, Opera8 & 
FireFox 1.0.7
& it worked in them alright. I think it should work in any other JS 
browsers as
well(haven't tested). that function can be called on the page load in 
WP.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Usability of post previews
Message-ID: <ebe43d680510280714j47d8b4d7r@mail.gmail.com>

As most of you will be aware, authors can view previews of their own
drafts by just going to the associated URL. That's fine, as long as
they don't decide to share this URL with their friends: suddenly
they'd be in a very confusing mix whereby their friends are looking at
a 404 page and they're seeing the post proper, for exactly the same
URL.

My question is whether we should consider just putting a notice at the
top of these pages that says something to the effect of 'No-one else
will be able to see this post, because it's a preview of a draft'.
I've developed a patch that provides this infrastructure, just asking
whether it would be a good idea.

On the one hand, it seems like a simple solution to a potentially
confusing problem, as outlined in the first paragraph. On the other
hand, the only time that poeple will see their drafts in this preview
state is likely to be on the write post screen, where (in 1.6) this
preview is loaded in an iframe to show the user what the post would
look like in its real setting. Here it's obvious no-one else will be
able to see this post, and as such the 'This is a preview notice' is a
bit superfluous.

Thoughts?

On my site, I modded the code to prepend [DRAFT] to the output title. 
[PRIVATE DRAFT] would be more explicit. ;)

Are people giving out URLs to their private drafts that this is becoming a

As part of a new effort from the PHP folks they're sending out builds of 
new versions of PHP so projects like WordPress can make sure their apps 
work with the new version.

We're looking for someone who would like to be in charge of testing out 
these new builds against WP and reporting back any problems. Ideally you 
need to be able to:

* Compile and test different versions of PHP
* Use Apache with different versions of PHP
* Click around WP and watch for errors in logs

If anyone would like to volunteer for this drop me an email.

I have already been testing with PHP5 and occasionally PHP 6 out of
CVS HEAD on my own servers, and as of yet there have been no major
troubles, but if you'd like, I'll be sure to set up some unit testing
more often with not only PHP builds but WordPress builds as well.

Updating to the latest PHP6 build makes one of my sites die out, I
think it depends on the size of the output. error logging is showing
emalloc errors, so its probably a PHP memory allocation bug. 5.1 out
of CVS is still fine as can be, using E_STRICT complains about var,
but very few people have that on.
