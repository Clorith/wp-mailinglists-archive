Probably so, IMHO.

And I thought he was being very ambitious...

* WYSIWYG will no longer annoy savvy writers

;)

But the "several more WP companies will be started" is a no brainer.  So
I guess he had to reach for something.

My 7 predictions (I'm overly optimistic day to day.  So my new years
predictions usually not.):
* Several big security scares will be raised that turn out to be issues
already fixed, but one (maybe two) major and several minor *real*
security related issues will be found and fixed quickly, quietly and
effectively.
* Microsoft blogging software will go to full release and will be dubbed
the WP killer (until it flops)
* WP will be bundled with several more OS's and web production packages.
* The Corel Corporation will put an injunction on the use of the
initials WP for WordPress.
* CMS will be come a major use case for WP and the next major release
will provide the intelligent tools to make it a true possibility.
* Tension and competition will rise and occasionally flare between the
open source publication solutions.
* The final WP release in 2007 will be named after Ryan's second...

I heard a good quote today "Who you are *today* is a direct result of
the decisions you've made in the last six months."  

May we all make the right ones...

I used to manually exclude these because of guilt (let alone  
invalidity). Didn't mean to upset anyone... just negligence, sorry...

No one's upset.  (At least I'm not.)  I just have a weird sense of humor
and it struck me as funny.  A real "Ha! Now I see what's going on!  It's
a grand conspiracy!" moment.  ;)

I've more than 10 plugins installed into my WP, some of them provide
some kind of version checking but more of them: none.

Would be a good idea providing some comfortable method for standardized
auto version checking of plugins? 

That could be also just some best pratice in codex documentation
(@Plugins), or more: some other brand new idea (methods or anything)
that plugin writers could add to their products to get a "standardized"
version check?

This just to not wandering around to websites looking for lastest
versions.

I've thought about this before. A plugin called Alchemy was looking to do
that (as well as plugin and them installs), but it seems to have died off.

Some people are big company people, and some are small company people. 
Money doesn't really matter if you're unhappy, I think if anyone at 
Automattic wanted to be working at Google they would be.

(And no one can buy WordPress anyway, it's an open source project that's 
separate from any company. :))

I think that if plugin writers could be "forced" to add a txt file (like
pluginname.ver) containing the number version of lastest stable to check
against owned by user archive distribution. A small method like
"get_plugin_version" could be triggered for example once a week?

The only problem is that for famous plugins this could be an hammer into
web servers.

I use to do that with my plugin Spreadshop, I have a txt version number
contained in svn at Google code. Each time someone opens option page it
checks for a new release number then displays in the option page.

Is WordPress a worldwide trade mark? If so the name is yours but the
source code is our (our as human beings). If not, hurry up and goto
registering it, also with wp-(\w)+ flavours. Anyone won't pay other
big(\w) company to say "my wp-blah plugin" in 2007 ;D

I have thought about the following: One could develop a meta-plugin,
which provides an admin page with information for each plugin like
current version, latest version available, nature of changes between
installed and latest version (security fixes), maybe even some sort of
changelog.

Plugin authors would provide this information in a standardized way,
e.g. in an XML file. This file could be put into a central repository,
or the plugin itself could carry the information where the update file
is. Creating the update file could be simplified and standardised with a
small generator form.

I have started developing such a plugin some time ago, but I didn't
continue, as I didn't know whether there would be an interest for it
(especially I wondered if a critical mass of plugin authors could be
moved to use it).

Alex

Hopefully this can be something we can bake into WordPress after the 
plugin directory is done.

I think it might be better to implement this as a plugin, for similar
reasons as Akismet is a plugin: People could upgrade it more often than
WP itself, they could deactivate it if they don't need it. Or have I
overlooked something?

If you are interested, I could develop a prototype and make it available
for review.

Seem the better way to do this, xml with directory. How long does it
take? :p

I think versioning shouldn't be an outside plugin, but a core feature of
wordpress, as plugins support is.

Would be better control it by options page, enabling/disabling version
control. It could check also WP version itself.

Could we, perhaps, use RSS to accomplish the same thing? If we used
ATOM, we could even include a patch as an attachment. Your meta-plugin
could work similarily to an aggregating service like feedburner. That
way we don't have yet-another-XML-Specification.

I agree with you that an existing specification should be prefered,
given it meets the requirements for such a framework.

Appending patches sounds like a great idea, although I'm afraid this
would produce complications with file permissions (especially with
novice users). It also could potentially cause a variety of security
issues.

However, I would happily proceed working on the plugin; but if
Automattic says they are working on a core implementation, I don't see
the sense of further programming this plugin. (Actually, the reason why
I stopped developing it in the first time is because there was this
confusion about who already works on such an implementation.) Therefore
I'd like to wait for a clear signal, whether such a plugin is desired or
not. Of course, I could go on, and the code could be later merged with
another implementation, be it a plugin or in the core.

Alex

Hi,

there was a thread about this topic and the possible technologies some
time ago on this list, see

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-July/007478.html
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-July/007481.html

I don't know if somebody (Computer Guru?) continued to develop the
plugin, but maybe this information is useful for you.

Best regards,

  Arne

I should have mentioned that I do know about this discussion (see
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/91718), and I had contacted Mr.
"Computer Guru". Unfortunately, he didn't manage to send me his code,
although he said he had no time to continue it and that he was willing
to send it. (But nevermind, I had chosen a different approach anyway.)

I also wanted to introduce my ideas on the wp-hackers list, but I
had (and still have) these annoying issues with my signed mails on this
list. As I had other things to do around this time, I forgot about it.
But now I decided to join the discussion again, as I still think this is
a very important feature for a system like WordPress, and I would really
love to write this particular piece of code. :-)


Best regards,
Alex

Just a note, I just sent the notice about WP 2.1 beta 1 to the 
wp-testers list. If you're interested in trying it, check out that 
mailing list.

If you're a theme author, plugin author, book author, you should start

...Sorry  if  it's off-topic or has been covered  previously
(here or elsewhere), but when will 2.0.6 be available, if at
all  (upgrade  route  to 2.1 instead)? One of my  sites  got
cracked  last  night  and we suspect it has to do  with  the
following:

http://michaeldaw.org/md-hacks/wordpress-templatephp-exploit/

No attack since the patch was applied (manually). Luckily we
had  recent backups and we maintain the physical server, but
it was scary stuff.

Best wishes,

Roy

Since it's a XSS attack that requires you to be a vector, just check

Matt,

In reference to Roy's email, can we expect 2.0.6 soon?   My 
recommendation is to put 2.0.6 out the door and leave 2.0.7 scheduled 
moving the remaining open 2.0.6 to 2.0.7 open.

Obviously there is a plan to get 2.0.6 out the door soon, pending 
certain things. We don't wait on things arbitrarily.

Hi there,

Is there any place that WordPress has links to the archives of the 
previous or current releases?  Right now when packaging wordpress for 
Gentoo, we have to upload the latest tarball to our own mirrors since 
'latest.tar.gz' could be any version.

Also, is there any place that has MD5sums of the releases?

Thanks

Yes and no.

http://static.wordpress.org/archive is supposed to have all of them, but as
I mentioned to Lloyd in September, 2.0.2-current have not been added.  I
believe he replied that they were aware of this. I'm not sure what the
difficulty is...

I recorded a conversation on the Skype on late Nov. (27-29 Nov 2006) and I
lost it (!!)

Is there any way to get this ~ 5-10 min recording ? 

Recorded it on a simple MP3.. and I have no idea when this Important
recording is (maybe the Saving didn't work)

 

If anybody can help that would be very much appreciated.

Thanks!

You can use Subversion to export a particular version.  For example,
svn export http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.2/
retrieves the files for version 2.0.2.

versions that would be nice. It keeps all versions easily available for 
those not used to svn.

However, we must clearly mark all older releases to be deprecated so the 
general public knows that no support can be given on these 'classic' 
versions.

ps: in the future this script could be enhanced with the ability to read 
the source and document the WP API ;)

All the best,

grtz

Since I updated to WP 2.0.6 earlier today, I've witnessed one and had  
one report of an "Internal Server Error - 500."

Could this be related to the upgrade, or just a weird coincidence?  I  
just thought I'd throw it out there...

Shouldn't matter. I don't believe there were any database changes.

OK, so that's why it didn't ask me. Maybe something got messed up with the
permalinks? Try and redo the htaccess file. That would be my guess.

Not sure if it's related, I didn't see any visible errors but Feedburner
started complaining:

"Your server disconnected us before sending the full source feed content. If
your blogging platform is TextPattern, this is a known bug, and a fix can be
found here: http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=11247"

On and off throughout the day, after I did the upgrade.

Strange... the feed validator isn't reporting any problems with 2.0.6  
feeds, and I've not had problems in any RSS clients I've tried.   
Don't want to say for sure that this is Feedburner's fault -- but I  
don't think anything changed with regards to feeds.  I'll look into  
it more and contact Feedburner for more info.

Oh god no!!!!!!!! Please!!

I've been talking to FB developers on and off for a month now. On *my* 2.1
blog, I get this all the time. I was doing them a favor, and trying to find
out where the problem lay. We haven't found a solution yet.....

But I do know the problem (and a workaround). IT's to do with the 304
headers and cache-control with conditional get clients. It seems that either
WP sends invalid 304 headers under certain circumstances or that FB's
conditional get client (which works great under other blogging engines) is
somehow fubaring the results.

This is also good news in a way. It means that the changeset is tiny: only
the files changed between 2.0.5 and 2.0.6  are responsible for this error.

The workaround isn't pretty, it involves pointing FB to a scraper file that
doesn't muck around with 304 redirects -  I'm blogging it now. Be forewarned
though, FeedBurner hits your feed up a couple of hundred times a day (or at
least mine), and if you don't have the bandwidth to support that, disabling
304 can be trouble.

FB encounters this error only when it runs into a non-changed page - so it
will always have the latest content, but your users will get a invalid XML
page all the while :(

I'm on it.  It has to do with that %$&^ing status header code.  We  
fix it for one thing and it breaks for another.  It's frustrating  
because we released two 2.0.6 release candidates with this code and  
no one mentioned the issue that I can find... there was a bug report  
for 2.1, but at the time the issue wasn't appearing on 2.0.6

At any rate, I think I have it fixed.  I'm putting in a commit in the  
next few minutes that seems to be working (and yes, I've tested on a  
PHP5.2/FastCGI setup).

2.0.7 was already planned, and the issue only affects 304'd feed  
requests, so it's not the end of the world, although I suspect I'll  
get my fair share of crap for it.  Whatever you do, don't discourage  
people from upgrading.  2.0.5 has multiple XSS issues and a potential  
SQL injection issue.

Great news, Mark :)

I certainly won't be discouraging anyone from 2.0.6, esp. since workarounds
exist.
I'll point this thread out to my man at FeedBurner, they're always on top of
things :)

I just tested on my originally-broken config (since months ago, as I
mentioned several times here in the list), and it seems to have solved the
problem.

Documentation of the problem and two workarounds:
http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/317

I was using "Workaround 2" for the past month or so, but it's good to have
this instead :)

Isn't WP 2.1 supposed to ship before 2.0.7? 
Ouch....

That  was a quick fix. I submitted this to Digg, hoping that
the  solution  will  be  visible  as soon  as  it  was  made
available.  I  guess a pointer in Wordpress.org  will  reach
people's  feedreaders/dashboards.  People  are  unlikely  to
score up such a seemingly-unimportant 'announcement'.

Thanks for digging it - I think what would be best is to get FeedBurner to
add a link to the workaround and later 2.0.7 on the error page, same as they
have for the TextPad glitch.

Just checked - this also affects local RSS readers and stuff.
Basically anything that uses conditional get requests, which is mostly just
RSS readers due to their high polling frequency.

Anyway, it's only serious for FeedBurner since other RSS readers will just
give you a "feed on error" notice or something similar - but FeedBurner will
kill your entire FB feed until it's fixed.

I don't think there's a need for another release or something, just an
official announcement/warning maybe...

Thanks for the awesome quick fix - mad props :)

I  made  a  mistake but calling it a minor bug, but  I  just
can't  change it now. Many really apologise for that.  Maybe
FeedBurner  can  devise  some workaround to  compensate  for
whatever it is which rubs them their code the wrong way.

Best wishes,

Roy

FeedBurner should try again... and it definitely will if you have WP  
set to ping FeedBurner (and WP users of FB should be pinging them for  
sure, to get their posts into their FB feed more quickly).  But it is  
rather annoying.

2.0.7 was already planned.  Don't know if this will change its  
release date.  At any rate, here's my take, and a fix (in several  
different forms for people of various technical capabilities):

It's not that simple. Every time FB tries again, so long as you haven't
posted anything new on your site, it will get the same corrupt headers over
and over and over.

When your blog pings FB - that means there's a new post, and your FB feed
will look as good as new. But in a matter of minutes or hours, depending on
how often FB polls your feed, it'll go awry once more. Especially if you
have a popular blog or don't post every couple of minutes, it's going to be
deep trouble.

I had readership of about 700 on FB - I had no idea about this bug, and when
I fixed it now my readership is about 300..... it can be really
catastrophic. I believe I lost all my local-rss-client readers and only
retained those using online subscriptions like NetVibes or NewsGator or
something.

I know, but I believe it was due to be released *after* 2.1 - which isn't
exactly very close anyway. W/E, just hope things work out.

Forgive me for being dense, but doesn't a 304 get returned when a  
feed is not changed? In other words, if a post is made, the feed  
changes. But then the next time the feed is accessed by Feedburner,  
the feed is not changed so FB will get a 304 kicking off this bug?  
That to me, _would_ seem like the end of the world, but maybe I'm not  
completely comprehending the issue.

I have not seen a problem yet on b5 blogs but I'm holding my breath.  
Maybe it's time to do an upgrade to r7225 (assuming 7225 has the  
commit that fixes this)?

I would assume 2.0.7 would come out after 2.1. That's how everyone said it
was going to work. I thought you were going to have to maintain 2.0.x for
awhile since it got put into debian (or did that ever happen)?

Message-ID: <0d0501c731df$b0479de0$d0dbee04@computer>

Just my 2 cents on the whole "assuming 2.0.7 being shipped after 2.1.."

Most know they just bumped up the version to 2.0.7-alpha now.. 
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/branches/2.0/wp-includes/version.php

And, since feeds are very "valuable" to most people...

a) Work out the problems for this quickly, and whatever else issues too.. (which of course will be happening!) .. 

b) Ship 2.0.7 out the door quickly, rather then (weeks of) having the volunteers point users to yet *another* site page, telling them "how-to" get such things fixed... because this is really more depressing, not to mention time consuming to *everyone*, and so forth.. ya know? 

OR..

b-1) Make a forum sticky on the index page there, with notes on such ("various") problems, and include references to such fixes for the ("various") issues. Until 2.0.7 actually gets out the door.. ? (Various meaning, someone had a 500 error already, don't think anyone's really sure on that, the feeds issue for another, whatever else that may (heaven forbid) popup)..

c) From what I'm getting, 2.0.X versions will most likely be first priority regardless. It's the "one" that is widely used, and known.. Well, for now at least lol. Even though 2.1 made beta, from what I'm getting, it's not "full-blown-public" yet.. 

Which is why I said above there, since these "issues" came up, and Mark J knows of them, rather then volunteers having to point users to another "fix or fixes" *again*..  I would just like to see 2.0.7 done/fixed up in a quick manner this time, and shipped quickly too. (I know, I know, quick isn't the greatest thing in the world)...

d) Which will be brought up in another reply email on this list, regarding the 2.1 - link categories, and will mention the beta forum..

I guess that's all on my mind for now, might not amount to a hill of beans, but, just wanted to get it out.. =P

It wasn't this list, it was going to be on the wp-testers list.. Even though most from this list, are probably on the testers list anyway.. :) ;)

It is 10,000x easier for them to fix this bug serverside than it is for 
us to update every WP blog in the world. I wouldn't be surprised if they 
correct for this bug soon. (One of their selling points is that they 
normalize feeds and are more robust, right?)

Nice one! However, what would suggest to do for when upgrading/installing WordPress for people? (Example: The installers for Install4Free, or just the average joe..)

Should "we" apply the "work around" to the 2.0.6 files first, before even uploading to do installations and upgrades? Or, just upload the normal 2.0.6 files as is, and wait for complaints? Just was wondering .. ;)

Hi,

We're having a small discussion at the MU forum whether kses is better than
HTML Purifier. According to HTML Purifiers own (subjective ?) comparison,
HTML Purifier is "better".

Have anyone here looked at HTML Purifier (http://hp.jpsband.org/)?

You'll find the comparison at: http://hp.jpsband.org/comparison.html


Kind regards,
Per Soderlind aka PerS

The main issue I have with it is the whitelist isn't user-definable -  
a major issue, IMO.

I think you're wrong (if 'it' = HTML Purifier), as far as I can see the
whitelist is user-definable.

Can we realistically target the end of January(around the 22nd maybe) for a
2.1 release?  We've been running the latest 2.1 bits on
wordpress.comwithout incident, and bug reports seem to have slowed
lately.  What, in your
opinion, is holding us back from a 2.1 release?

I'd like to bust a move on the remaining bugs, churn out betas and RCs as
needed, and get this damn release done.

Hop on #wordpress-dev and #wordpress-bugs and help get the final push to
release going.

I agree, the beta (even the previous alpha) works perfect. IMHO, it is time
for a RC.

Just a note on the release date, considering the "120 days release schedule"
mentioned before, i see February 1st a better option. Like it or not,
sticking to the "real" calendar keeps you on track.

I agree with the others. I've been running 2.1 since (some time of) the alpha1, and since just recently going to beta, she's been working just fine here. No complaints.. ;) :)

However, I'd want to maybe do something about this though:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2007-January/003573.html

Just thought I'd throw that out.. =P

i'm running php 5.2.x and apache 1.3.37 and will be testing WordPress
2.1-rc1 when it comes out, particularly w/ the WPG2 2.0 plugin
(gallery 2 + wordpress integration).

is there an updated list of features to expected for this release? and
will it be available to the masses for testing or just exclusive to
those subscribed to this list?

lastly, will there be any plans to include (in this version or future
releases) a core feature (or a plugin that come with the default
WordPress package) to retrieve System Information Details (php
version, server operating system, user-agent, # of active plugins, #
of themes installed, mysql/apache versions, etc) which i find very
useful when providing support especially in the forums? or is there an
existing plugin already the does that?

please advise, thank you.

Then did you figure out the cause of your random link category/category
merge confusion?
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3418

We start messing with people's content, and causing novice computer
people a few evenings worth of cleanup, the 2.1 release will get a bad
name really quickly...

Maybe we should come up with a list of things to clean up before the
upgrade.  Things fix any duplicate post category names etc...

I as well have been using 2.1 since the alpha stage and now the beta.
 There are certains things that you don't want users to come across if
they upgrade and that includes breaking their existing themes
(especially blogroll) and plugins.   Viper has an idea on those docs.
 In terms of my experience thus far with it, I don't have any bugs to
report anymore as it is working top notch and I have it running on 6
different installs.

Release it whenever you feel it is warranted.  That would be my call.

I recommend the 'Diagnosis' plugin by N. Lindblad. If I wasn't tense
waiting for my browser to come out of its frozen state (I think the
Windows Vista website killed it with the 'Orb' flash animation that
comes up) I'd give you a link, but if you Google it (or Yahoo! it, or
AltaVista it) you should get a result.

I've been using 2.1 for a very very long time now (basically a month or two after 2.0 was released) on my production (high-traffic) blog, and I haven't experienced a single issue (except once) that stopped me from using it or backfired. 
However, that doesn't mean that 2.1 is ready for release now, like Mark has been saying with the 2.0.6 issue, we need heavy testing _from the public_

A lot of issues can only be found once WP is deployed in quantity - in order for that to happen we have to try to get as many people as possible to use WP 2.1 before its *official* release.

I can agree with this though, I guess that's why I pointed this out last time:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2007-January/003573.html

It basically says the same as C.G. says above, yet covers other things too. 

a) Having someone start on a 2.1 Section or page, in the Codex itself? With notes on what's different within 2.1 itself. Then..

b) Like Michael B mentioned here already..
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-forums/2006-December/004154.html

Maybe something can be done with the Beta Forum itself..? 

c) Since the 2.0.X betas seem to only last a short period of time, and being that most talks about it are handled through here.. How about deleting all the 2.0.X beta related threads? 

OR..

c-1) Locking that "Beta" forum all together, and archive the 2.0.X Beta threads.. (Have it so those can't reply to them)..

OR..

d) Delete all the 2.0.X related beta threads, and just change the title of "Beta" to =>  "2.1 Beta"? 

With a sticky, or some stickies at the top, containing the "way to download the 2.1 beta", "the way to join the testers list", "the changes", "features", "what's to be expected", "whatever else"..

This way, "word" would be out ahead of time.. So it's not going to be like a HUGE surprise to the (masses) users, which are so used too, and familiar with the 2.0.X versions..? 


IMHO, with 2.1-beta here now, which contains a few backend end "modifications",and so forth.. I really think it'd "help" in the long run, to get some "word" out on the 2.1 itself in the forums, and Codex.. giving the "masses" the heads up. 

I know there was several blog posts made by the dev(s), coders, and so forth.. But there are still people, that are lost to the wind on everything sigh..  I don't know though.. what's your thoughts on this ?

We should give notice to the localization crowd to be prepared. Also
maybe I should issue the pot files more regularly and let translators
review and catch up if there are any updated strings.

I guess discussing the topic about the internationalization of plugins
and themes meta data should be postponed for at least 2.2 ;)

Also, in my opinion it will be very helpful to release a public (by
public I mean on the dev blog and everything) in order to have
first-hand experience from a broader public.

Once again! I know, I know.. I'm sounding like a broken record here. Hahaha.. =P 

So, to summarize a little more in detail here..

1) Maybe try and figure out that Viper007Bond "issue" there, or whatever.. =P 

2) Maybe make a "2.1 Beta" forum? (If I had the "powers, and say to do so", I'd make one lol!)... 

3) Make a sticky, or some stickies at the top of the 2.1 Beta forum, containing the "warnings, "do's and don'ts", "how to download the 2.1 beta", "the way to join the testers list", "the changes", "features", "what's to be expected", "where to report the issues", "whatever else".. 

[Do's and Don'ts being] - not to upgrade over their live 2.0.X blog's, but as a new one. 

[Warnings being] - General warnings, also, maybe some in reference to the link categories changes, whatever else..

[How to download] - Where they can get it from, obviously lol! Which is through the testers list, but, maybe make a downloadable link in the post there.. (ducks from flying objects)...

[The way to join testers list] - Which I'm sure most know already, but still.. 

[Changes/Features] - Maybe post some of the informations from Ryan, Mark, and whoever else's blog, on this stuff

[Where to report the issues] - Of course, one of the lists, hackers/testers, or 2.1 forum maybe?

[The whatever else] - It's pretty self explanatory right, haha. 

4) Not too sure about this one, but, maybe make a post on the Dev Blog. Which would contain roughly the same information as the 2.1 Beta forum stickies?

5) If you make the 2.1 full_blown_public in any way, and the users don't want to join and post to the wp-testers or wp-hackers list. You're almost going to have to make a 2.1 Beta forum, or, just use the current Beta forum.. but make a sticky or stickies at the top, as mentioned on 3).. 

6) Skip the whole Beta forum idea, but take the ideas from 3) and whatever else, and just apply it to a DEV Blog post? (But keep number 5) and second to last paragraph in mind though.)

I'm not really sure on 4) though, I'm a little skeptical about making it totally full_blown_public. Because some might think, "Wow! I'm going to trash my 2.0.X blog for that one!! I want to be cool and awesome, just like spencerp is!!" Hahaha.. just kidding lol!! =P 

Even though some of us are, and have been using it since day one or whatever, it's still technically only for "testing" purposes. And, I'd hate to see *all* the normal WordPress support forums hammered with TONS of 2.1 support questions.. (Even though I haven't been in there lately lol.. *cough* thinking of the mods and volunteers).. 

Might want to specify about that, for after making the 2.1 Beta forum or something.. "ALL 2.1 Related Questions stay in this 2.1 Beta forum!"

I'd like to follow up on this one, according to their doc, you can create a
whitelist using HTML.AllowedElements and HTML.AllowedAttributes: 
http://hp.jpsband.org/live/configdoc/plain.html#HTML.AllowedElements

There are (sample) plugins for MODx and Drupal at:
http://hp.jpsband.org/#Plugins

Note: I'm not saying HTML Purifier is better than kses, I'm asking; it is ?

Matt should probably put a post on the dev blog which appears as one

Yep, planning to post some time next week after we hit RC.

If anyone wants to help out, check out this list:

http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&milestone=2.1

Even if you can't code, just verifying that a bug exists is 
super-helpful. Bang every piece of 2.1 that you can, the more we break 
it now the better the release will be.

Message-ID: <236d6d6a0701080921r3348d69ak6c84da49389c0d07@mail.gmail.com>

I'm the author of the postlevels plugin, which allows logged in users to see
private posts. In order to ensure that posts aren't seen if the plugin is
disabled, the posts have a post_status = private . This, obviously,
conflicts with SQL queries that depend upon post_status = public.

The the loop, this issue is solved easily, as the filters posts_join and
posts_where give me the hooks to edit the SQL. However, these are the only
hooks, which means that archives, categories, and next/prev links don't work
correctly (see the ancient trac issues:
#1368<http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1368>,
#1442 <http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1442>,
#1691<http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1691>,
and #2415 <http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2415>).

With some careful if statements and string replacement, it looks like I can
work around not having these hooks -- obviously this is not a very stable
solution, since it's pretty dependent upon whatever queries are hardcoded
today.

Questions:

   1. Now that there is a query filter, does this mean that no more
   "narrow" SQL filters will be added? I.e. should I stop holding my
   breath for those Trac issues?
   2. If not, what would it take to get those filters added for 2.1?
   They've been around for years, and do have patches included. I'm happy to
   re-code / test the patches myself.

Thanks!

Speaking of that, I'd like to graduate from "one who uses production releases only after they've been out for a month" to "one who sometimes deploys beta releases", starting with the 2.1 beta.

The WordPress site doesn't have a link to get the 2.1 beta.  I've joined WP Testers, but in the meantime I could use some guidance:

	- Should I be using the latest beta release posted to that forum?  (In which case, could someone please post the URL?)

	- Or, is the recommendation to get the latest 2.1 nightly via SVN?

Thanks,

http://wordpress.org/beta/wordpress-2.1-beta1.zip

A beta2 will be coming soon. I want to push out packages more often so
people can get up-to-date bits without having to use svn.

        - Or, is the recommendation to get the latest 2.1 nightly via SVN?


SVN is preferred because it is always up-to-date, but the beta packages are
fine if you don't want to hassle with SVN.

Hi,

 

Just started with the upgrade of ImageManager to WordPress 2.1. ImageManager
uses buttonsnap to add a button to the editor. Since the current version of
buttonsnap doesn't support the tinymce editor in WordPress 2.1 will there be
an update of buttonsnap or are there other alternatives ?

 

Kind regards,

Per

If you put those tickets on the 2.2 milestone, we can get them in right 
after the 2.1 release on Jan 22.

This may be ancient history and history may have been my worst subject
in school, but I believe ButtonSnap was a product of the evil genius
Owen Winkler [1]. I do most of the TinyMCE maintenance for WordPress
but I never studied up on ButtonSnap because it was so capably
maintained on Owen's WP projects page [2]. Now I can't find there.

Owen, what's the status?

Is anybody else familiar enough with ButtonSnap to take over if Owen
has no interest in its maintenance? Apparently a lot of plugins depend
on ButtonSnap. The leading authority on the subject seems to be Kirk
of MaxPower [3].

I'm trying to figure out how I can filter a posts content, without 
filtering an excerpt.  I know that I can check is_archive to see if I'm 
in an archive (which usually uses excerpts), but it seems like there 
must be a way to do this.  I tried attaching to the_excerpt, and setting 
a static variable that my function attached to the_content could check, 
but it seems that the "the_content" filters are executed BEFORE the 
the_excerpt filters.  Is there some way to do this now, or can we set 
some sort of variable that can be used to see if WordPress is going to 
turn the post into an excerpt?

I talked to Owen about this, and he basically said that there's an
issue with Buttonsnap in that its shooting for a moving target as far
as the TinyMCE version in WordPress, so really any sort of library for
this kind of development needs to go into WordPress core, because
trying to get the plugin to hit that moving target is just too much
hassle.

Including it in core is fine by me.

Oh how I'd love a built in API to add stuff to the WYSIWYG editor. It'd make
my life so easier.

Oh, and I managed to get buttons added to TinyMCE in 2.1. It wasn't all that
difficult (thanks to do the dude from http://an-archos.com ), but it
required basically making a fullblown TinyMCE plugin and adding it in via
some hooks and such

As a sort of casual technical-but-not-super-wp-savvy developer type,  
I'd be interested in helping in the 2.1 beta testing effort, but one  
of the hangups is I don't know exactly what I'm getting into by  
installing it.  I understand the best advice is "back up everything  
before you test it," but if the rest of the world is anything like  
me, they need a little context to understand exactly what it means to  
enter the beta zone.

In particular I'd like to see some clear description of whether I can  
easily go back to 2.0.6 if things go wrong. I know I can just back  
out the files on disk, but what are the implications to my database?  
WP always seems to "update the database" when I update the release,  
but is that always the case? Is there really always a change in the  
DB to reflect the version?  If so, do I have to restore from backups  
or does simply replacing the old files allow me to downgrade? These  
kinds of questions might have obvious answers to many of you, but  
you're not looking for help from people who this stuff is obvious to.

I think in particular at this page:

http://wordpress.org/download/beta/

You could keep the emphasis on "do this at your own risk" while  
making it a lot clearer what the implications of beta testing are, so  
technically brave people have that many fewer mental roadblocks to  
getting on board. Right now to become a beta tester I have to:

1. Search around for information about what the implications of  
installing are.
2. Backup, install, and test.

Since you want "the public" to help, you want to make it as easy as  
possible for them to do so. A guide of best practices or at least  
more explicit warnings will help that, I think.

MIght not be the right time for anybody to focus on that, but for  
future testing exposure it might help to make it more accessible.

You have to restore your DB from a backup to go back to 2.0.x.

When we announce a Release Candidate to the public, we'll include more
detailed instructions.  I don't know if we have anything in Codex yet that
is appropriate.  Anyone want to whip up a "So You Want to Test a
Beta/Release Candidate?" codex page?

No, people have encountered all sorts of problems by upgrading to 2.1,
then downgrading to 2.0.x.

If you're planning on downgrading at some point, don't. Instead, just
make a copy of your existing database so you can fall back to the
backup at some point.

WordPress 2.1 features an 'export' feature, which can export your
posts to an XML format. You can then import that XML file into
WordPress 2.0 with the help of a plugin called 'WordPress-to-WordPress
Import' <http://www.technosailor.com/wordpress-to-wordpress-import>.

Hello all, I found that there is a new exploit for wp-trackback.php script
using Sql Injection. Details can be found here -

Does anyone test it? I have to say that for some of my installations of WP
it works and for other not. I did some quick fix for this specific
exploit, but it is not ideal...

Ouch - I can't believe I misread that - thanks for pointing that out to
me...

I created a blog on a server that matches the requirements outlined in the
exploit - it didn't work however.

Subject: [wp-hackers] 2.1: Alternative to query_posts?
Message-ID: <482e70070701101021s51f8d395pd215dae2699e6e20@mail.gmail.com>

Not long ago I set up a template-based alternative to Owen's Adhesive
plugin (which has been a little troublesome for me).

I set a category for sticky posts, hid that category in the sidebar
with exclude= and set home.php to use two loops, one for only the
sticky post category, and one for everything but the sticky post
category. I set up each loop with query_posts like this:

<?php if (!is_paged()) { query_posts('cat=48'); ?>
<?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
      loop for category 48, sticky posts
<?php endwhile; endif; ?>

<?php query_posts('cat=-48'); ?><?php } ?>
<?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
      loop for everything else
<?php endwhile; endif; ?>


The if (!is_paged()) bit is to keep the custom queries on the front page only.


This was working great for me with 2.0.x, but with 2.1 beta 1 and beta
2, it only works when category 48 is not empty, i.e., when I have a
sticky post. In 2.0.x, if the category is empty, the if (have_posts())
bit would return false and the first loop would have no output. But
with 2.1, the query returns an SQL error and dies.


Is this a bug in 2.1, or should I be setting up the loop in some other way?

Cool - these are exactly the kinds of real-world tips that would look  
great in the high-level "so you want to help" document that Ryan  
alluded to.

Thanks for the tips.

Well, I didn't get a response, but I DID find the solution.  It was to 
put a priority of one on the filter that I attached to 'get_the_excerpt'

You can see it used in my Attachment Manager Plugin:

Thanks for your response, Ryan. Here's the message:

WordPress database error: [You have an error in your SQL syntax; check
the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right
syntax to use near '48 AND (post_type = 'post' AND (post_status =
'publish' OR post_status = 'privat' at line 1]
SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts LEFT JOIN
wp_post2cat ON (wp_posts.ID = wp_post2cat.post_id) WHERE 1=1 48 AND
(post_type = 'post' AND (post_status = 'publish' OR post_status =
'private')) GROUP BY wp_posts.ID ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 10


That's a copy and paste, so the post_status = 'privat' near the
beginning is not my typo... just noticed that.

Looking through the code I can't see an obvious bug in query.php that 
would cause this.

You should have something like the following in the generated query 
rather than what you do have:

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts LEFT JOIN 
wp_post2cat ON (wp_posts.ID = wp_post2cat.post_id) WHERE 1=1
  AND category_id IN (48) AND (post_type = 'post' AND (post_status = 
'publish' OR post_status = 'private')) GROUP BY wp_posts.ID ORDER BY 
post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 10

Do you have any plugins installed that filter the WHERE clause?

Thanks, westi. No plugins are enabled at all. (That's first on my list

Message-ID: <45A59E5A.1000904@szub.net>

I seem to be missing something.

I'm playing around with the new 'query' hook, using a regex to remove
the current date/time check that occurs so as to display future-dated
posts.

And it works pretty well (even list_cats is cooperating) except when
displaying a post in single query mode. At that point it fails, though
I can take the query generated, as is, and call the post manually.

What else is going on in the background here?

2.0.x?

I'm not sure.   Maybe something is tripping up the paging queries?

But of course. :)

And since I'm getting bugged about this privately...

* WP 2.0.6 (default permalinks, default theme, no other plugins)
* IIS 6
* PHP 4.3.11
* MySQL 4.0.21

> I'm not sure.   Maybe something is tripping up the paging queries?

Let's see.

As I noted, duplicating the query I can manually query the post. It
only seems to be on single post displays I'm getting nothing through
The Loop. And as a single post query there's no date-related info, so
my plugin's filtering is not doing anything at this point.

Let me further note after some testing I find it works when I as the
author of the post am logged in. Being logged in as another user, or
not logged in at all, is when the post fails to display.

I've dealt with this before -- check line 684 of wp-includes/classes.php --
the sytem is checking for the read_post cap if you're looking at the single
view of a post without post_status of publish or static (a page).

Note that if the user isn't logged in, you're out of luck, the system clears
the posts array if the user isn't logged in. One (hacky) workaround would be
to save your queries in the query hook and use it to requery during the
the_posts filter ...

It depends on your PHP version and you need register_globals on.  It  
has been fixed in WordPress 2.0.7 RC1.

I suppose "register_globals on" *is* the security hole? ;) If your application requires register_globals turned on, then please rewrite by your own (if allowed by the included license) or search for an alternative. "register_globals on" is bad (in combination with other PHP options a nightmare).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Automatic multi-host WordPress upgrade
Message-ID: <1168512525.8522.30.camel@localhost>

Hi list,

we all know how agonizing it can be to update web applications,
especially if it's many of them and they want to be updated frequently.
However: sh*t happens, and it's better to have frequent updates than
none at all. Still, if you have many installations to care for, you
might want to wish a (semi-)automatic solution to upgrade them for you.

As for WordPress, I have created such a solution, which does a fine job
on my server and I wanted to share. If you have a vitrual or decicated
root(!) server, you can use this little bash script in order to upgrade
a number of WordPress installations automatically. This of course
happens on the command line (bash).

If there are people who do have many WP blogs and a shell, but lack the
root access, it should be easy to adapt the script for non-privileged
usage.

ATTENTION: Use at your own risk and make sure you have backups.

I hope it saves somebody a couple of hours. (Usage hints below.)

  path to the WordPress install and the URL to the website, both
  separated only by an equation mark, no other characters(!!!). Example

WordPress has never required register_gloabls to be turned on.  We  
hate register globals.  :-)  We have code in WordPress that  
unregisters global variables.  The bug was a PHP bug that makes use  
of unset() to de-register variables unsafe.  I found a workaround.

After much discussion on this list and with various hosts, I think this is
the plan.  2.0.x will continue to work with 3.23.23 or greater.  2.1 will
require 4.0 or greater.  2.2 will require 4.1 or greater.  There were
several requests for a longer lead time before requiring 4.1.  Delaying the
bump to 4.1 until the 2.2 time frame should be enough heads up.  Since
2.0.xwill be maintained for a good long while, it is always an option
for those
who can't or won't upgrade MySQL.

Sound good?  If so, we can make an announcement to let folks know what is
happening.

As one of those running 4.0, I like it... It'll give some of us enough time
to pound it into 1and1's heads.  Since all of their blog are on WordPress,
hopefully they will listen...

Ryan,

Perhaps you could explain why there is a need for a newer version of 
mysql? Which features are lacking that urge us to use a newer version of 
MySQL. Or is the reason that MySQL AB is removing 3.23 from their 
support? Just curious.

You can add a .htaccess handler to make php5 handle .php files on 1and1,.

So tentatively, the Codex Server Requirements will read:

WordPress server requirements for versions prior to 2.0:
* PHP version 4.1 or greater
* MySQL version 3.23.23 or greater

WordPress server requirements for version 2.0:
* PHP version 4.2 or greater
* MySQL version 3.23.23 or greater
* (Optional) Apache mod_rewrite module (for clean URIs known as Permalinks)

WordPress server requirements for version 2.1:
* PHP version 4.2 or greater
* MySQL version 4.1 or greater
* (Optional) Apache mod_rewrite module (for clean URIs known as Permalinks)

WordPress server requirements for version 2.2 (not yet released) and later:
* PHP version 4.2 or greater
* MySQL version 4.2 or greater
* (Optional) Apache mod_rewrite module (for clean URIs known as Permalinks)

Any other adjustments necessary?

Why would you put system requirements for versions before 2.0? The oldest
non-trunk branch being supported and sub-actively developed is 2.0 -- 1.5 is
long gone and won't be maintained whatsoever...

Actually that's what's currently showing in Codex (reference to before 2.0)
but I'll gladly remove it.

Yeah, that's probably a good idea. We wouldn't want anybody running 1.5 at
all, and probably not 2.0 once 2.1 is released. Although I can't remember
how long, if at all, 2.0 is going to be maintained after 2.1 gets out the
door.

Anyone on this list using IIS or Apache-Win?  How does 2.0.7 RC1 handle?  Do
feeds look okay?  Does feedburner work for you?

Ryan, 
Could you all give some thought to a standard name for the latest
tracks.  With 2-3 years remaining of multiple tracks running AND USED,
it would be convenient to have a new naming standard.

For instance latest.tar.gz could remain and always point to the Latest
and Greatest, but so could:
latest20.tar.gz
latest21.tar.gz
latest22.tar.gz
For the individual tracks/versions.

With my update script, and now Alex's, out there it would be nice to
have a link that would ALWAYS be the LaG in the 2.0 series and one for
the LaG in the 2.1 series and probably our current link for the overall
LaG.  

It would be nice to carry that structure over to the Beta side of things
too.  One link that is always the LaG beta/rc.

Then we could configure our scripts to each of those, and the user would
simply choose ONE of them to be their flavor of choice for the blogs
updated by that script.

Just a thought...

Hi to all,
        is wp-mail.php script configured to pubish only if "From: " mail
address is in the list of publishers? And is it Akismet ready?

Source from trac is 4 month old:
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-mail.php

Last, what about adding some support for attachments? Such as images
and videos.

No, I don't believe there's really any security at all, especially since the
"From" is incredibly easy to fake.

The idea is to keep the e-mail address that's used secret.

Nice script Alex!  It is very similar, in concept, to a script I sent into
wp-testers a week ago:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2007-January/003541.html 

Yours has a different implementation, of course, but the basic thrust of it
is the same.  I like what you did with that cut function.  Keeping a
separate configuration file has its advatages!

I found one other script that does similar things, but it was specific to
this persons site. I think it was mostly for new blog installation.  It even
went out, downloaded and installed the standard plugins she desired for each
of her blogs.

I started my script back in August, last year.  It was six lines or so.
Version 2.0RC1, released today, is now 800+ lines with documentation.  It's
grown just a bit, but I tried to make it so that the novice user can edit
just one section and it will work giving them full backups of files and
tables in the process.

Anyway, my latest script will always be at
http://www.TheCodeCave.com/EasyWPUpdate  Feel free to peruse it and use any
ideas you like.  It is not GNU but free.

I really do think that these scripts are the way of the future for WordPress
updates.  There is no reason anymore for any one to spend 40 minutes (or
even hours and hours) to update a blog.  Not when this stuff works.

Those who are testing either of our scripts won't even have to think about
the update process.  They telnet in, run the update and boom they are done
with safe backups they can use in case anything went wrong.... 

I just think this is a far better world.

Thanks again for posting your script!  I really like the techniques you've
used.  They were definitely at a higher level than I was. I've learned some
neat stuff by reviewing what you did.

Hello,

I'm doing a code formatter plugin (I'm new on wordpress plugin
development). I could make the visualization step. But I'm having a
problem...

Is there a way to avoid the wp' edition to "cut out" the tabs and
whitespaces? (that is the last thing missing...)

Example: when I post:
                      while ($hasMore) {
                              $i++;
                              $start = strpos($content, "[code]", $offset)+6;
                              if ($start == false || $start < $offset) {
                                      $hasMore = false;
I get on the database:
while ($hasMore) {
$i++;
$start = strpos($content, "[code]", $offset)+6;
if ($start == false || $start < $offset) {
$hasMore = false;

Thanks!

Good morning.
I've upgraded a few installations of WP 2.0.5 to the new svn version,
and it results in two plugins throwing mysql errors; both Event
Calendar 3 and Auto Close Comments. Basically, they're now reporting
this:

WordPress database error: [You have an error in your SQL syntax; check
the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right
syntax to use near ' WHERE post_date >= '2007_1_1' AND post_date <
'2007_2_1' ' at line 8] SELECT DISTINCT post_title, post_date,
DAYOFMONTH(post_date) AS day, MONTH(post_date) AS month,
YEAR(post_date) AS year, (category_id = 1) AS is_event FROM , WHERE
post_date >= '2007_1_1' AND post_date < '2007_2_1' AND post_status =
'publish' AND id = post_id AND (post_date_gmt<='2007-01-13 15:33:59' OR
category_id=1) ORDER BY post_date ASC

That is to say, for some reason both of these plugins have lost the
table name. (select * from where). Has there been a change recently in
what variables are available for the plugins?

"Recently" as in "ages ago", yeah. All table_* variables were removed;
use $wpdb->prefix, $wpdb->posts, etc. instead.

Shouldn't we include rss.php here, not registration.php?

Russ, 
Yes, there were separate variables that held the table names.  They were
depreciated in version 1.5 and the developers tried to get the word out
for this.  In the comments, the 1.5 code said that the variables would
be around for a few more months:

// We're going to need to keep this around for a few months even though
we're not using it
internally

$tableposts = $wpdb->posts;
$tableusers = $wpdb->users;
$tablecategories = $wpdb->categories;
$tablepost2cat = $wpdb->post2cat;
$tablecomments = $wpdb->comments;
$tablelinks = $wpdb->links;
$tablelinkcategories = $wpdb->linkcategories;
$tableoptions = $wpdb->options;
$tablepostmeta = $wpdb->postmeta;

As you can see the preferred way to access this information is through
the $wpdb->tablename method that was added to the (then) version 1.3
source code in the summer of 2004.  

As it is now 2007, the 2.1 release is FINALLY removing these variables
as the comments indicated would be done two years ago.

Please contact the author of those plugins and send them to this link:
http://wordpress.org/development/2006/12/naughty-or-nice/

That will help get them back on trac with the WordPress code.

I've got basic example code for external plugin tmce buttons at:

http://an-archos.com/anarchy-media-player#download

It's working on both WPMu and WP 2.1 beta for my media plugin and a  
lot of the Mu folks would be glad to see an updated ImageManager for  
2.1/Mu, myself included. If you need any info on integrating the  
buttons feel free to contact me off list and I'll do my best to lend  
a hand.

Cheers,

Malcolm

Nop, it gets all in one line...

If I enter (on html box):
[code]
<pre>
line 1
line 2
</pre>
[/code]

I get on the database:

[code]
<pre>line 1 line 2</pre>
[/code]fim do teste

Is there a way to disable post formatting on editing?

Thanks!

Do you know where I find examples for how to add quicktags in WP 2.1 / MU ?

No but I've been meaning to add quicktags, just haven't got around to  
looking into it yet. I'd certainly be interested to see what you come  
up with though  : )

Check out v4 of my video plugin:
http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/

It uses Buttonsnap if TinyMCE is off and an external TinyMCE plugin (thanks
to some help from the an-archos person) when it's on.

Message-ID: <45AB8AC9.3090308@bdisfunctional.net>

Hi there,

I would like to offer visitors of my client's site the ability to upload 
their mugshot including some comment to the site. I've been looking at 
the wp_handle_upload function which seems perfect for this, but it is 
solely available in the admin-functions.php and there doesn't seem to be 
a hook for this or am I missing something?

ps: Sadly, for now I'm bound to the 2.0.x versions due to the isp using 
mysql 3.23 :(

have you tried using lists or tables?
with lists every new <ul> gives you another level of indent in your code.
with tables ( tho i havent tried this yet ) people seem to have a table 
of one row one column and put all their text in that single field.

you can see an example of lists working on my site:
http://www.ionous.net/2007/01/12/syck-and-c/

hope that helps,

So as to standardize and insure that contributors are getting their plugin
compatiblity information in the correct location, I've moved the
compatibility pages under a Plugins/Plugin Compatibilty page in Codex.

2.0 compatibility list:
Old Article:  http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/2.0_Plugin_Compatibility

2.1 compatibility list:
Old Article:

New Article:  http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Plugin_Compatibility/2.1

Also a new article, http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Plugin_Compatibility
was created to link to the appropriate version article.  The old articles
are redirected to this page also.

Thanks to everyone for contributing to those articles.

Thanks for the new links Michael. I never noticed the "don't work" sections.

WordPress 2.0.7 has gone gold.

	http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/wordpress-207/
	http://wordpress.org/download/

Unofficial changed files list, changes diff, changed files only zip,  
as usual:

changed-files-zip-changes-diff-changed-files-list/

Details on the dev blog post about what has changed.  Note that the  
only thing that changed from 2.0.7-RC2 to 2.0.7 (final) was the  
version string in wp-includes/version.php

I've written a couple plugins that make use of the built in uploader
functions. Works quite well.

Just load the file in since you need it:

require(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/admin-functions.php');

Coding question: Is it better, generally speaking, to use require_once
in plugins?

Viper007Bond,

Could you get the overrides so far that it would upload in the 
$uploads/$my_dir?

I would like to seperate my files from the regular uploads ;)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Upgrade instructions fatally flawed for Mac
Message-ID: <45AC167B.3070303@metalab.unc.edu>

There is a major bug in the upgrade instructions on 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress that can cause Mac users 
to lose their data. This needs to be corrected. The problem is here:

Step 3: Overwrite Files

Get the latest and greatest WordPress (http://wordpress.org/download) 
and upload it to the WordPress directory, overwriting all the files that 
exist there. This will preserve your images and themes.

Actually it won't, at least not on a Mac. I think what happens on 
Windows is that when you copy a folder such as wp-content onto an 
existing folder, files inside the target folder are retained if the new 
folder does not contain different versions of those files. However, on a 
Mac the behavior is different. The entire target folder is completely 
wiped out and replaced by the new folder. No content from the target 
folder is retained under any circumstance.

I would recommend making an upgrade distribution that does not include 
the wp-content folder to avoid the possibility of overwriting user files 
within this folder. User and system files should be more cleanly 
separated. An upgrade should not touch the user's files.

I agree that the possibility of data loss is given when an empty
directory is copied to a location where an identically named directory
exists. I also experienced this behaviour with some Linux apps (thank
god not on really important data). Whenever I describe the upgrade
process to somebody, I stress that wp-content/ needs to be deleted in
the upgrade package first.

I don't see the need for a specific upgrade package, though. I think
it's not asked too much doing this little step manually. However, Mark
Jaquith kindly provides diff packages:

Elliotte, you are welcome to update the wiki page!

As long as everyone follows "Step 1: Backup " then it should be ok.

Thank you for finding this,

LOL  OK, I'll admit what you're doing is REALLY cool.  Especially how
you've integrated it with the user accounts, but... 5.2 Seconds doesn't
include the downloads and backups! (And I bet it doesn't include the
Update.php steps either...)  And 182 sites... size isn't EVERYTHING you
know...  (Gee, never thought I'd have to say that....)  

All that aside, I'd rather have your 182 sites than my 6 :)

That's 5 minutes and 2 seconds, not 5.2 seconds - in case there was  
any confusion. I'm not quite THAT good. :-)

The steps do include running every sites upgrade.php via cURL.

Downloads and backups? Eh... who needs 'em when you have managed  
backup services. :p

Subject: [wp-hackers] Translation/language issue in latest dev build
Message-ID: <45AC2E74.5040908@poplarware.com>

I thought I would test a couple of plugins for compatibility against 
the SVN repository (this seems to be a good idea?).

One plugin I was testing, which is a modified version of Polyglot 
(which allows you to create a multi-lingual blog), is having some 
trouble.  When the plugin detects that I'm asking for a Spanish 
language post, it sets the locale of WordPress to Spanish. This of 
course means that all the text on the blog page that has been 
Gettexted is translated into Spanish -- at least, that is what is 
supposed to happen (and did in 2.0.6). But instead I am getting a 
totally blank page (even on the Admin pages). When I remove the .mo 
file, everything comes back (but of course not translated). The .mo 
file worked fine in 2.0.6.

Unfortunately, I don't have a good setup for debugging (since I run 
PHP/MySQL on a hosted server), so it is hard to tell exactly what is 
happening (no PHP error messages).

So I am wondering, has something major changed in how gettext or 
translations are done, between 2.0.6 and the current dev version of 
WordPress?  Meanwhile, I'll keep poking around...

Thanks,
      Jennifer

Well then... I bet we'd be in a pretty fair heat...  Give me your root
password and I'll try my script out and we'll see how it compares :).
Actually, I'm sure our copying speed is about the same.  My script has
everything loaded up front, and yours has to read in the settings from
each user account. I just might have an advantage there.  Hmmm, I think
I could take ya...

LOL and I think 1and1 would have a conniption fit if I setup 200 blogs
just for the fun of testing...  Kind of fun to think about though...

I don't know where that came from, it always said to not overwrite
wp-contents...

I do know that the detailed instructions give this info, and it was always a
point of contention as to what the upgrade instructions should be.  If my
memory serves me correctly, Matt didn't want the basic upgrade instructions
to include the delete everything but wp-config and wp-content, then upload
new files instruction.  So perhaps in the editing, the important step of not
overwriting wp-content was left out.

I've CC'd this to wp-docs, perhaps Michael H or someone else who still
manages the codex will look into it.

This might be related to bug #3577, which was just fixed.

Do you still have the problem with the latest svn?

Your themes, images, etc. should all be named differently than the
default. I don't think the fact that the default theme should not be
edited in place is something that is stressed enough. If people were
to abide by this, nothing of importance would be overridden. Also, not
uploading wp-content at all is a rather poor idea, imho, because no
new themes in future versions and such, or no new default plugins,
etc. etc. would make it into upgraded sites

That looked promising -- the .mo file was indeed created by POEdit, as 
described in the bug report.

However, updating WordPress to SVN trunk version 4736 (which got the 
new version of gettext.php and everything else updated since Friday) 
did not fix the problem I am seeing. Also, I didn't have the problem I 
am currently seeing in 2.0.6, and the only difference between 
getttext.php between the 2.0.6 version and the 4736 version appears to 
be the new change. So...

I'll do some more testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Yeah - that's about what it breaks down to. I enhanced my script  
slightly before running the 2.0.7 upgrades. Tweaked a regex and  
slimmed some code. Also dropped the SVN stuff right into the script  
as opposed to invoking a secondary script. I'm always looking to  
improve on speed so if you think I can get it to a .5 second upgrade  
per blog, please advise. :-)

I only have around 25 blogsites to manage, but I found using Gentoo
Linux's webapp-config you can upgrade your web applications very
quickly. If you don't take into account the setup cost, 0.5 sec/blog
is certainly very achievable.

Here's a rough routine

1. Create a wordpress-2.0.7.ebuild (30 seconds). It's actually quite
easy -> just copy the one from wordpress-2.0.6 (which was copied from
previous versions). Gentoo ebuilds instruct how source file is
downloaded, which ones are configuration files, which files are owned
by webserver, etc.

2. Emerge WordPress 2.0.7 (15 seconds)

$ emerge wordpress

3. Run upgrade! I have all sites under /var/www, so

cd /var/www
for site in *; do
  if [ -f $site/htdocs/wp-config.php ]; then
    webapp-config -U -h $site -d / wordpress 2.0.7
    curl http://$site/wp-admin/upgrade.php?step=1 > /dev/null 2>&1
  fi
done

Gentoo's webapp-config DOES NOT copy the Wordpress files onto each
site, but instead it uses hard links so its pretty quick and space
efficient. When I run it it's definitely running faster than
0.5sec/site (on a 256Mb VPS).

Cheers,

Scott

Please re-read the original messages in this thread. That comment is  
incorrect, and exactly counter to the point being made.

where that came from: 15:43, 16 Feb 2006 MichaelH (Including Carthik's
5-Step Upgrade)

in the context of the whole instructions it is a lot less scary, but I
imagine still something that a worksmith will improve. (Many of the
FTP clients on Mac also work with a UNIX/Windows interpretation of
folders).

Version 2.0.7 changes only these files, so for a Mac, how should the
instructions be written to put these files into "action"?

Message-ID: <4e0fb41b0701152347u4b91df12k8a8deb981ab78a7c@mail.gmail.com>

I'm getting a bug in 2.0.7 (I've seen it in earlier versions as well) where
the inline uploading process creates different sized thumbnails depending on
the image's ratio and/or file size.
Example:
Uploaded an image 1152px wide by 864px tall and WP generated a thumb that
was 128px wide by 96px tall.
Uploaded another image that was 576px by 479px and WP generated a thumb that
was 96px wide by 73px tall.
Then resized image 2 to be 600px wide by 450px tall and WP generated a thumb
that was 128px wide by 96px tall.

Has anyone else witnessed this behavior (and is it normal)? I submitted a
ticket http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3588

Thanks for any help,
Ryan

I actually have a backup of from right before I upgraded to 2.1, so you can
test on the real install I have the problem with. I don't know if you'll be
able to reproduce it or what, but you can try.

Just e-mail me an address I can attach the dump to:   [make up something

Check out the function. I believe there there are filters to control that.

Hello

I think this behavior (wipe or not th directory) is related to the FTP
client much more than to the platform..

I'm on a Mac and I don't remembrer having this problem

I updated 4 sites on MACs yesterday with no problem (and never had a
problem). I always upload the wp-content so I can get the current version of
Akismet in there. 

I would definitely check your FTP client and possibly server.

The premise is correct however. it wont surely be anything to do with  
the FTP client or source OS - only whether the server is running OSX..

That's not true. Uploading wp-content erases everything in wp-content, 
including files that are not replaced; at least on the mac. That's the 
problem.

This is why the user-supplied files shoudl be more cleanly separated 
from the system files.

Perhaps some ftp clients have this issue too. I don't know.

I noticed and verified the problem on a Mac where I uploaded via 
straight Finder copies; no ftp involved.

Our very own Matt has had a problem with this in OSX:

http://photomatt.net/2005/04/06/braindead-finder-behaviour/

It is more of a way that Mac handles things than being a problem. 

I can't see changing the structure of WP as it is (a vast majority of other programs out there have folders that are combinations of user/core files - ie: drupal, smf, phpbb). Actually Wordpress is one of the best for keeping core files/user files separate.

The very first step in the Codex for upgrading states: 

> Step 1: Backup Database Tables and Files including .htaccess

This should always be followed. I even follow it on Windows and *nix systems. Always better safe than sorry.

The issue is whether the "overwrite folder" behavior of the client (whether
an OS, FTP app, SFTP app, etc.) is to (1) overwrite the folder or (2)
overwrite individual files within the folder.  Even different FTP clients on
Windows that work both ways by default.

Amen.

Aha! It turns out it was a change in wp-settings.php, version 4202, 
checked in on 21 Sept 2006. These two lines were added (I think 
something similar, but not quite the same, was removed from a 
different file at the same time):

if ( defined('WPLANG') && '' != constant('WPLANG') ) {
	include_once(ABSPATH . WPINC . '/streams.php');
	include_once(ABSPATH . WPINC . '/gettext.php');
}

Here's the sequence of events.

a) My config file has WPLANG set to '' (default language for blog is 
English).

b) The Polyglot plugin (when it eventually is loaded) checks to see if 
someone has requested a different language, and sets WPLANG to that 
language then. For example, if someone has requested Spanish, WPLANG 
gets set to 'es'. Polyglot also causes gettext to read in the es.mo 
file at that time, and sets up translation.

c) Prior to the 21 sept check-in, this worked fine. Either gettext was 
loaded no matter what, or the loading took place after Polyglot had 
set WPLANG correctly. I have not investigated to figure out which is 
the case.

d) With the current version of wp-settings.php, however, when 
wp-settings is loaded, WPLANG is still '', and gettext.php is not 
loaded. Therefore, when the plugin asks gettext to read the es.mo 
file, WordPress dies and the user sees a blank page.

e) Work-around: I set WPLANG to 'en' in my config file, and everything 
is fine. wp-settings thinks a language is needed, gettext.php is 
loaded, and then Polyglot does the right thing with translation.

So... should I file a bug on this? Is there a reason that gettext 
should not be loaded for everyone?  Or is it a feature?

Message-ID: <45AD3105.9030202@copperleaf.org>

I've been playing with a plugin that creates entries in the posts table 
with post types other than post, page, and attachment. I'm doing this 
with the idea of using the commenting components that already exist in 
Wordpress (moderation, akismet, etc.) instead of growing my own. While 
playing with this, the standard comment feed and trackback links were 
displayed with the links being 
http://localhost:8080/wordpress21/?feed=rss2&p=5 and 
http://localhost:8080/wordpress21/wp-trackback.php?p=5. I wasn't 
surprised that these would fail in my case because p=5 will look for a 
post/page. However, it did prompt to try and create a page with a 
standard attachment using the upload functionality linking to a page. 
The same problem occurred. The links contain a querystring with p= 
instead of attachment_id=. This was done with the default theme and 
syncing with svn and the 2.1 branch. Any thoughts on how to fix this?

Message-ID: <00dc01c739d9$0564d850$f97ab481@rossweb>

Has anyone else seen this problem?

My sidebar seems to be invisible in IE7 since I upgraded to 2.07. It still
looks fine in FireFox.

Initially I thought it may be some changes I made to the Anthurium Mix theme
I was using, but then I switched back to Kubrick and the problem still
exists.

 

This is the site: http://acbc.hostiz.com/

It's a free host (hostiz=yo-yo), so if it's not there, come back later.

Can anyone see if it is a mistake I have made somewhere, before I upgrade my
other, more critical sites?

 

Thanks.

   RMWB.

This is true. Using the Finder and the localhost environment (I use MAMP)
will surely overwrite all folders (done it myself once). But this is not the
case with FTP clients for Mac (unless there is some preference I haven't
seen). Currently, Transmit, Secure FTP and FireFTP function as expected.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Codex updates for 2.1?
Message-ID: <45AE43C7.4040602@poplarware.com>

I am cross-posting this to the Hackers and Docs lists, because I think 
it may require input from both communities.

Being a programmer who loves clear documentation, I've been looking 
over the about-to-be-released code for WordPress 2.1, and I have 
noticed that several things have changed that a plugin or theme 
developer would want to know (new filters, some functions deprecated, 
etc.). I have also noticed that the Codex could probably use a bit of 
reorganization (it looks like several people have discussed this 
recently in the Docs list archives; I just joined the list).

So what I am wondering is:

a) Are there plans to update the developer section of the Codex for 
2.1 changes? I didn't see any in the Docs list archives for Dec/Jan, 
and I just joined the list, so I am not sure.

b) I am also wondering if it might make sense to start a whole new 
developer area in the Wiki for 2.1, and in the process, reorganize the 
existing developer documentation a bit.

c) Once 2.1 is out, will the Wiki need to keep around all the 
information for 2.0.x as well?  For how long? And do we need some 
documentation on the changes (such as what a developer needs to do to 
ensure plugin and theme migration, avoid deprecated functions, etc.)?

Thoughts? And yes, I am offering to help, and maybe even to organize 
projects around this...

I can't answer A, but my opinion on B, is "YES" because the answer to C is
that the 2.0 stuff has to stay around until sometime in 2010.  Ryan's
committed to keeping the 2.0 trac viable for 2-3 years.

The answer to the bonus question is yes, IMNSHO. Some of it is already in
existence, see http://wordpress.org/development/2006/12/naughty-or-nice/,
but there needs to be more...

He guys,

I've made a proposal due to a wish of one of my clients to explicitly 
define the max_side to be either the width or the height. So I changed 
the wp_create_thumbnail function (located wp-admin/admin-functions.php).
Besides this I changed the error handling in this function in such a way 
that upon error it will return the error as

$array['error'] = "Errormessage"

and made some of the returned error messages more descriptive.

Looking forward to your ideas and feedback and I hope it will be useful.

See my proposal here:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3605

ps: I used the 2.1 trunk for this and this is my first diff/patch so be 
gentle ;)

All the best,

grtz

OK... In that case, I will see about starting a re-organized 2.1 
Developer Doc section, including a migration from 2.0 section, and 
plan to leave the 2.0 documentation section alone (although once there 
is actual content in the 2.1 section, link(s) from the 2.0 sections 
will be useful).

Unless I hear otherwise...

As I said above - it effects anyone who may (unlikely perhaps but not  
impossible) be using OSX Server. Forget FTP -  it is irrelevant. A  
folder replace on OSX (server of otherwise) replaces ALL contents.  
Same for people like me running an Apache server on my iMac. And  
users may not be aware that they are being hosted on OSX...

The model MySQL uses might be useful.  Take a look at how choosing the
version on the left effects this page:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/sql-syntax.html

Notice the consistency in the URLs allows:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/sql-syntax.html

That allows the menu on the left to make a simple substitution based upon
the current URL.  Something similar might work for WordPress
documentation...

Let's assume that we've established the issue exists.  

With the files arranged as they currently are, what is the simplest method
to install these files on a Macintosh?

And will that same procedure work for a 2.0.7 upgrade to 2.1 installation in
which the main theme will, I assume, have undergone some alteration?

Subject: [wp-hackers] escape data before db insert?
Message-ID: <45AE6754.20609@bdisfunctional.net>

Hi all,

Sometime ago I had a discussion about escaping data in Wordpress. If I 
understood it correctly, this person claimed that every GPC data will be 
escaped by Wordpress before handing it over. I actually doubt that this 
is the case due to the existence of $wpdb->escape().

Now my question is: Do I need to manually call $wpdb->escape() on every 
piece of data I would like to insert into the database or not.

Actually when I do use it, I get an extra slash with this example:

$string = "O'Reilly" (comes in via $_GET or $_POST)

after I use

$wpdb->escape()

becomes after retrieving it from the database and echo'ing it:

O\'Reilly

So I presume it is already escaped before I used $wpdb->escape() and the 
extra $wpdb->escape() changes it into O\\'Reilly before inserting it 
into the database.

Could someone of the core team tell a bit more about when to escape and 
when not as. I would like to harden my plugin against XSS and SQL 
injections and I'd rather not have someones wordpress install get messed 
up due to my plugin.

Thanks in advance!

Users will need to manually copy individual files folder by folder, as long
as WordPress mixes user and system files.

Just to reiterate, this isn't just a Mac OS X issue.  It happens with
anything that overwrites folders (vs. overwrites files) on copy, including
at least one Windows FTP client I've used in the past.

The solution is user folders, e.g. user/themes and user/plug-ins, that never
ship with WP.  That doesn't mean that the wp-content/themes and
wp-content/plug-ins folders go away, it just means that we know that those
can be replaced wholesale since WP "owns" them.

This still does not ring true to me. MacOS X FTP server software will
follow the FTP protocol.

It is quite some time ago that I experienced this, but in my
experience it was Finder, and I recall using other file managers on
Mac OS X that did not destroy-replace folders.

What FTP client are you using? Finder? Or are you using Finder locally
on your server?

Sidebar: My usual upgrade method is to unpack the tarball directly  
into the user's blog directory, which neatly overwrites all changed   
files without touching unchanged  stuff . But since the official  
tarball  unpacks into a "wordpress" parent directory, I first create  
a new tarball from within a temporary wordpress directory, which I  
can then scp into users' individual blog directories and unpack. If I  
could  tell the tar command  to unpack its contents into a  
destination dir without creating the "wordpress" parent directory,  
this process would be easier. But I have not been able to find a tar  
flag to do that. Suggestions?

I've often wished there was a downloadable archive that didn't unpack  
with a parent directory (but I also know that would  annoy users  
unpacking it to their desktops or wherever, so there isn't a  
snowball's chance of that happening).

I'm not aware of a tar flag either, but you could certainly script  
it. drop it in /usr/bin just so you have it for use later just by  
typing the command

bash script wp-untar:
#!/bin/bash
wget http://www.wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz >&2>/dev/null
tar zxvf latest.tar.gz
rsync -r wordpress/* dest_dir/

Aaron's solution is elegant, if you want to be ultra geek the answer
is 'pax' (not standard on Linux, but I think it might be on Mac OS X).
I only know about this from my days of AIX and needing to strip root
dir from tarballs.

I don't qualify as being from the core team but until one of them gets back
to you, I can tell you that if you look at wp-settings.php, you can see that
it cleans all of the _get _post _cookie and _server content:

// If already slashed, strip.
if ( get_magic_quotes_gpc() ) {
    $_GET    = stripslashes_deep($_GET   );
    $_POST   = stripslashes_deep($_POST  );
    $_COOKIE = stripslashes_deep($_COOKIE);
}

// Escape with wpdb.
$_GET    = add_magic_quotes($_GET   );
$_POST   = add_magic_quotes($_POST  );
$_COOKIE = add_magic_quotes($_COOKIE);
$_SERVER = add_magic_quotes($_SERVER);


So, if your plugin is being activated by WordPress hooks and functions, your
data will already be clean.  Where someone can get into trouble is their
plugin is called seperately from WordPress. If someone can type the name of
your php file and add on whatever parameters it needs, your plugin is then
acting outside of WordPress's protection.  It is completely independent, at
that point, and must not only provide the slash protection, but also the
security checks required to make certain the action being performed is done
by someone having the required rights.  Always test your plugin files to see
what happens when they are called independently with $_GET and/or $_POST
values specified.  If you don't try it, someone else surely will.

Authors without the unfiltered_html capability have their posts  
filtered by KSES, eliminating the XSS risk.  This is just an issue of

No.  GPC will be pre-slashed for you, just as if magic_quotes_gpc  
were on.  Values from the database will have to be reslashed before  
going back in.  If you're modifying GPC input, you should stripslashes 
(), modify, then $wpdb->escape().

I recently clarified this in the codex (it had incorrect information):

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpdb_Class#escape_- 
_Escape_For_SQL_Queries

It started as O\'Reilly and then the additional manual escaping made  
it O\\\'Reilly (yes, three slashes... slashes are escaped by slashes,  
so the first two slashes come out as one slash and the third slash  
and the quote come out as a quote, giving you back the original O 
\'Reilly)

So, as an exercise:

<?php

// populate from $_GET
$GET_test = $_GET['test'];

// populate from DB
$DB_test = $wpdb->get_var("SELECT something FROM sometable WHERE foo  
= 'bar'");

// now prepare both values for a query
$DB_test_safe = $wpdb->escape($DB_test);
$GET_test_safe = $GET_test; // Already safe

$wpdb->query("INSERT INTO something (test1, test2) VALUES 
('$DB_test_safe', '$GET_test_safe');");
?>

Here are my rules:

1. anything that would be escaped by magic_quotes_gpc can be assumed  
to be escaped in WordPress and can be safely used in queries **so  
long as the original superglobal has not been manipulated**

2. manipulations of GPC superglobals should be done on copies,  
leaving the originals escaped

3. manipulations of copies of GPC superglobals should be done after  
running stripslashes() (so you're working with the data, not the  
escaped data)

4. manipulated copies of GPC superglobals MUST be re-escaped using  
$wpdb->escape() before being used in SQL queries of any kind.

5. All data not originating from GPC must be assumed to be unsafe,  
including stuff from the database.

I thought we'd all established that this is nothing to do with FTP.  
It is the way OSX operates. Copy a folder onto an existing folder  
with the same name and the original content is wiped and replaced by  
the new content. That will include any sub-folders that may have been  
in there as well. Forget FTP - it's nothing to do with FTP. It's how  
OSX will deal with the command.

The suggest by Charles above is, of course, a smart idea but hard at  
this point, I assume to switch to. All the original guy was  
suggesting was better documentation to guard against people wiping wp- 
content altogether. Not too much to have asked for I would have thought.

It would probably be easiest going forward if 2.1 created a new non-user 
folder such as wp-system-content. That way existing installations could 
be upgrade without changing the name of or replacing the files in 
wp-content.

There may be issues with some FTP clients, but FTP is not required to 
experience the bug. Indeed using a good ftp client may help prevent it.


1. This is a problem for local Finder copies.

2. This is a problem for for network Finder copies; i.e. when the 
server's disk is mounted over the default Apple file sharing protocol.

I suspect, though I haven not yet verified, that this is also a problem 
when the network server is mounted over non-default protocols like NFS 
or SMB.

I am not sure what happens if one were to use rcp or scp to make the 
transfer.

This isn't just a Mac issue... all *nix OSes behave this way.  It is  
Windows with its "replace == merge" convention that is the exception.

That'd introduce a lot of complexity and break backwards  
compatibility in a lot of things.  I like the general principle of  
deleting the wp-content directory from the upgrade package before  
dropping it on top of an existing install.  The only issue there is  
that plugins and default themes don't get updated, but it saves your  
data, which is a bigger concern.

it has everything to do with how one is interacting with the file

Regardless of this pissing match over Finder vs FTP, I altered the
instructions 2 days ago to say "do not overwrite your wp-contents
directory".  If someone wants to add to manually overwrite Akismet, knock
themselves out.  I don't think Default or Classic have been changed in quite
sometime, and anyone using default or classic have probably made changes,
and wouldn't want them overwritten anyway.

I know I'm oversimplifying, but isn't the gist of it checking for two
folders instead of one, and then deciding which has priority (probably user
themes but system plug-ins) in case of conflicts?

Now:

// If a plugin file does not exist, remove it from the list of active
// plugins.
foreach ($check_plugins as $check_plugin) {
	if (!file_exists(ABSPATH . PLUGINDIR . '/' . $check_plugin)) {
		$current = get_option('active_plugins');
		$key = array_search($check_plugin, $current);
		if ( false !== $key && NULL !== $key ) {
			unset($current[$key]);
			update_option('active_plugins', $current);
		}
	}
}

If WordPress supported user folders:

// If a plugin file does not exist in either the system plug-ins
// folder or the user plug-ins folder, remove it from the list of
// active plugins.
foreach ($check_plugins as $check_plugin) {
	if (!file_exists(ABSPATH . PLUGINDIR . '/' . $check_plugin)) {
		$current = get_option('active_plugins');
		$key = array_search($check_plugin, $current);
		if ( false !== $key && NULL !== $key ) {
			unset($current[$key]);
			update_option('active_plugins', $current);
		}
	}
}
foreach ($check_plugins as $check_plugin) {
	if (!file_exists(ABSPATH . USERPLUGINDIR . '/' . $check_plugin)) {
		$current = get_option('active_plugins');
		$key = array_search($check_plugin, $current);
		if ( false !== $key && NULL !== $key ) {
			unset($current[$key]);
			update_option('active_plugins', $current);
		}
	}
}

I think that 2.1 is past feature freeze (a release date less than two weeks
out has been considered here), but this seems like both a very solid
solution to the more general issue and a worthy feature.  We should be
seeking to make Wordpress upgrades as easy as possible, especially in light
of the history of subtle security issues.  It gets us closer to that goal to
genuinely separate user scripts from system scripts.

It *can* be written.  It can work cleanly.  It can improve the application.
Charles, I guess I'm signing on to help.

Yes, for that, but plugins may be accessing things more directly,  
counting on wp-content to be the place where that stuff exists.  But  
if you see it as possible, don't let me be a wet blanket.  Let the  
code do the talking. :-)  We're likely going to have a bunch of big  
brainstorming sessions once 2.2 work gets under way, so start taking  
notes.

I changed  this so that gettext is always loaded.  The fix is in RC1.
Thanks for debugging.

Yeah, this is definitely 2.2 (or dare I say it, 3.0) material.

Message-ID: <b24851260701180318w36eefa8bvc672b30eacf00686@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening,

The Debian package of Wordpress should ship with a copyright file that
isn't just a pointer to http://wordpress.org/about/

Besides http://wordpress.org/about doesn't mention some names that I
grepped in the source, that I appended on the email below.

Could we please improve it? Copyright right dates would be great too.

Best wishes from Cornwall,

Hi, my Debian mentor Moritz Muehlenhoff asks for the copyright file that
I maintain on Wordpress be improved. Ideally I think the URL
http://wordpress.org/about/ could be improved.

For example there are some contributors that are not mentioned there.

Ideally dates should be added.

Anyway, I quickly tried to improve the copyright file for the 2.0.7
release. I added names there that I saw in various little plugins and
what not. Take a look at the attachment perhaps.

Best wishes from Belgium,
-The Debian Wordpress maintainer

Hi,
When working on the AM report I checked wordpress's copyright file.
It can be improved, but the errors are not critical:

- It only points to an online URL for the contributors, which might
  be 404 in the future
- There are copyright holders not mentioned in the above web site,
  e.g. Ulf Harnhammer or 2005 Moxiecode Systems AB

Please fix in the future, I'll send out your AM report in the next
hours.

Cheers,
        Moritz

Ah, gotcha.  Maybe we can give plug-in developers a function or two to help

Excellent!  I'll do whatever I can, too.  I'm more of a PM-type than a
coder, but I know enough to be dangerous.   :O)   Time for me to spend some
cozy time with the source...

In the current development version of WP source code, in 
functions.php, there are functions called get_theme_root() etc. So, 
the functions already exist, to some extent. The question is whether 
people use them or not (probably they don't too much, and that applies 
to the WP source code too).

It doesn't appear there are similar functions for plugins, but I am 
not sure.

Thanks -- I have verified RC1 does not have the problem I identified

Message-ID: <8f93a7390701180742q7e15eebamadae93ac14675d82@mail.gmail.com>

What's the best way to use the built-in image uploading functions to upload
to a directory other than the one set in the admin area? I wrote a gallery
plugin that uses the functions and the client now wants the gallery to
upload to it's own folder.

I'd rather not move the files after they've been uploaded (they've had
problems with files being overwritten, which I don't see how that's
possible, but whatever), and I'd rather not reinvent the wheel and come up
with my own filename via $override['unique_filename_callback'] or whatever.

And sorry, can't pastebin the plugin. It's closed source. Happy to explain
what I'm doing though and how I'm using the functions.

Most plugins I see seem to rely upon:

    $pluginpath = ABSPATH . 'wp-content/plugins/';

And

    $pluginurl = get_settings('siteurl').'/wp-content/plugins/*';

Since this change would most likely affect a large number of plugins (and
possibly themes), hopefully a decision can be made on implementing it in the
near future, that way word can get out to all developers to update their
sources to utilize the new directory structure. 

After that is done, then wp-content/plugins can be utilized more for
Wordpress default plugins (ie: Akismet). The other option then (as much as I
hate rekindling this old fire) is possible moving  TinyMCE to a plugin
included in that directory that is activated by default. Actually there may
be other features that could be moved to the default plugins directory,
which are core features not used by everyone (Links directory comes to
mind). This would make Wordpress much more "modular" IMHO.

Didn't I come across a new constant defined in 2.1 named PLUGINDIR ?
Which I recall is set to 'wp-content/plugins'

I'm a good coder, and I have been rooting around in WP code for a couple
years now, authoring custom plugins, themes, and a couple hacks.  I can do
all the work, but wouldn't by any means refuse the chance to collaborate.
The /most/ important part of this feature is it's design.  Should we allow
the path to be configurable?  Should we allow it to be outside the webroot?
What security implications does that introduce?

No.
For coders, geeks and that kind, it is OK to be outside the web servers 
document root.
For many other normal users, that will be too complicated.

Awesome.

> Should we allow the path to be configurable?

Let's depend on convention over configuration at first, keeping it
conceptually simple as we introduce it.  However, any new WP functions that
need to be created could abstract the path to the point that they wouldn't
prevent this from becoming configurable in the future.

> Should we allow it to be outside the webroot?

I can't think of reason that this would be necessary, but others might.

Of course, I don't suggest not providing a useful default.  I don't mean to
be dense, but how is support for the scenario complicated exactly?  I'm not
following.

For Mac servers, the problem stems from directory replacement behaviors.
IIRC that is how we ended up here.
That leaves us with the important question of how can Wordpress:

a) deprecate wp-content/plugins and wp-content/themes
b) while continuing to support existing plugins which depend on that path
gracefully
c) make sure that the new 'user-extensions' directory exists on install
d) not overwrite that directory on upgrade

By my thinking it will require the path to be customizable by configuration.

I can also say that I have some concerns over the security of the model that
allows us to write plugins that generate HTML responses.  I don't know that
having the new user extensions directory outside the webroot is necessary,
but would want to consider it at least.

Hi,
I know this has been covered here before, but I was wondering if any  
simple way of making categories 'linkable' in WordPress 2.1 was  
added, or do i still need to manually type in the category name in  
the blogroll section the first time, for them to show in the list  
there? I find this pretty confusing, and I want to set up a large  
number of categories with both links and posts.
thanks in advance,

A less intrusive solution might be more compatible.  Rename the wp-content
directory, in the distribution tarball, to wp-std-content.  Then during the
install/upgrade process, the files in the wp-content-std directory are
iteratively copied into the wp-content directory.  WordPress would make no
other references to wp-std-content.

Since this is a file by file process, the whole directory replacement
argument is moot.  There does not need to be a massive rewrite of existing
plugins.  No testing need be done on all the areas of the core code that
reference plugins or themes.  It a has a limited scope of change and limited
testing requirements.  It does not complicate the tarball.  What are the
negatives?  Are the functions required to perform the copy going to be
active in all php installs?

Do you mean the cats don't show up  in the list in the "Categories" box when
adding or editing a link? Are you creating a bunch of cats via
Manage->Categories and then assigning them to both links and posts.  If so,
we definitely need to do something there since once a new cat is assigned to
a post it won't show up in the cat list and vice-versa.

And this requires WordPress to have write permissions to the filesystem.
That is currently not the case and I believe it would gain us very little
over the current system.

Yes. I'm toying with the idea of using WP 2.1 as a link/article  
portal, and I just added 50+ categories that I want to be visible in  
the add link page.
Is there any manual DB change I can make to bulk-add them?

.htaccess is written to, if nothing else.  If write access is the problem,
the fix could be to reference wp-std-content if wp-content does not exists.
We could probably put such a rule in .htaccess.  Though I think a core code
solution would be better.

I'm not so sure this issue really needs to be fixed, as it has not caused
problems even up to this point.  But if a fix must be made, an objective for
that solution should be that it not lead to more harm and confusion than
what the original issue caused.

So, solutions that break a bunch of plugins, for a bunch of users, seem to
be inappropriate if fixing the issue for a very limited number of servers is
the main pay off.

Something to keep in mind...

The output of wp_upload_dir() as defined in wp-includes/functions.php  
is filtered at the end through the 'upload_dir' hook.  Is that enough  
for your purposes?

The current problem is that user and system files are intermingled within
individual folders.

This first step is to separate user plug-in and theme files into their own
folder.  These user folders would be in the root folder and not included
with WP, so users can drag in all files and folders from new WP
distributions and everything will be fine.

I understand you're talking about the use case where someone using a
folders-replace-folders client (not a "Mac servers" issue per se) could drag
the single "wordpress" folder over their "wordpress" folder, but for that to
be useful we'd have to move /all/ user files outside the WP root
(wp-config.php, wp-images, etc.).  That might be a really great thing to do
in the future, but that shouldn't block this interim improvement.

> a) deprecate wp-content/plugins and wp-content/themes

No, these have to stay as system plug-in and theme folders.

How about a solution that separates system and user content, by moving
the system content?  To wit:

- Move system supplied content to a new directory (e.g. wp-syscontent)
- Change core code to look in both this directory and wp-content (with a
priority on one or the other -- that argument yet to be had)
- From then on wp-content is solely a user directory
- On update, don't touch wp-content

This involves only changes to core code, doesn't farkle with user
content directories on update (avoiding the original problem), doesn't
break a bunch of existing plug-ins, and more elegantly separates user
and system content.

The mix of customized files amongst standard files is peeving.  It makes
backups either unnecessarily wasteful or complex.  It makes upgrading more
of a chore than it need be. See also your upgrade script (which I haven't
taken the time to try to adapt).

sorta like deprecating $table_* purely for stylistic purposes? :)

I think your point is valid.  We might be too far down the road with the
current directory structure to change short of a 3.0 release.

I offered to help with implementation but if we can't find agreement on the
scope of work than I'll spend my time on something else.  If I'm the only
person standing on this side of the fence, I won't pick a fight.

This can be made unnecessarily complex, but solving the current problem (of
mixed user and system files in folders) is straightforward:

- Add "My Themes" and "My Plug-Ins" folders to the root folder.*

- Whenever the same theme exists in the user folder and the system folder,
prefer the theme from the user folder.

- Whenever the same plug-in exists in the user folder and the system folder,
prefer the theme from the user folder unless it's older than the plug-in
from the system folder.

Once this is implemented, users who like how it works now can still use WP
that way.

Your change is greatly appreciated, but it also does not address any

I specifically had hoped to clarify why some people think Mac OS X

(I'm reluctant to continue the thread because I think this has been
explained multiple times, but here's a try at a summary...)

> the problem?

There are two things a client can do when copying/moving folder "Foo" (we'll
call this "new Foo") into another folder that already contains a folder
called "Foo" ("old Foo").

- Behavior 1:  Replace Folder

  In this case, you assume the user wants to replace "old Foo" with
  "new Foo" wholesale.  Any files in "old Foo" that don't exist in
  "new Foo" are gone forever.

- Behavior 2:  Merge Folder

  In this case, you assume the user wants to merge -- that is,
  replace individual files in "old Foo" with same-named files in
  "new Foo" -- the two folders instead of replacing them.  Any
  files in "old Foo" that don't exist in "new Foo" are still
  around.

Mac OS X users can merge folders using the FileMerge utility that ships with
the OS <http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/macosxhints/2006/03/cmpfldr/>.

*Examples of different clients include Mac OS X's Finder, FTP app running on
Mac OS X, Windows Explorer, Sftp Drive (which mounts an SFTP server as a
Windows drive letter), the Linux "cp" command, etc.

I like that idea as well. It avoids breaking existing plugins, and can be
readily changed in core code.  My ideal solution would be to dig the user
content out from the bowels of the wp code, but this works.

This problem only exists when copying folders using Finder.

When using Terminal and the cp command existing files will be left  
alone.
I did a quick test in Terminal:

/* create two directories with the same name in different locations */
 > mkdir -p mytest
 > mkdir -p mytest1/mytest

/* populate the directories with some files */
 > f=1;while (($f<5));do touch mytest/$f.txt;((f=$f+1));done
 > f=1;while (($f<5));do touch mytest1/mytest/new$f.txt;((f=$f+1));done

/* copy the second directory to the location of the first directory */
 > cp -R mytest1/mytest .

/* list the content of the first directory */
 > ls mytest/
1.txt  2.txt  3.txt  4.txt  new1.txt  new2.txt  new3.txt  new4.txt
 >

So you see: the files created in the first directory are still there.
Tested on Mac OS X 10.4.8 in Terminal

Sorry for the late reply, I've updated the download script to support 
specific versions. This should work for every named release since 2.0.4. 
Example download:

http://wordpress.org/latest-2.0.4.zip

latest-VERSION.type

> Also, is there any place that has MD5sums of the releases?

Example MD5:

http://wordpress.org/md5-2.0.4

md5-VERSION

Does that help?

A lot of WordPress coding decision are guided by backward compatibility as
it should be. So a decision to use stored procedures should be backed by:

1. Actual tests with prototype demonstrating performance benefits. I don't
think there would be significant benefits as there aren't many repetitive
queries.
Queries can be cached if you use object caching. Also the whole page is
cached if you use page caching plugin like wp-cache 2. Normally application
servers benefit from using stored procedures. WordPress serves requests
using PHP in a one-off fashion. Unless it is redesigned to take advantage of
persistence of data across requests, stored procedures isn't going to help
much.

2. Automatic Fallback to using plain SQL queries to support earlier MySQL
version

Thanks Matt, that is better.  Do you think we could get a more standard naming 
scheme going though?

How about http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.0.4.zip and wordpress-2.0.4.zip.md5sum

Thanks!

First off, welcome! :)

Right now our baseline MySQL is version 4.0:

http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/

Historically we've been able to do everything we wanted from stored 
procedures in our PHP code, and it's worked just fine.

Was there any particular functionality you wanted from SPs?

Thank you Malcolm, ImageManager is now working in WordPress 2.1 :) I'll test
it a bit more before I release it.

Using buttonsnap, I'm able to add the quicktag button when rich editing is
disabled, but how do I add the button to the code tab when rich editing is
enabled?

Btw, which WordPress version have the new TinyMCE ? How to I check for
version number ?

To be honest: meh. Nothing unexpected. ;-)

If it was at least something like

Porn
Joomla
Iraq

(or all of them together). :-D

Btw, I do wonder whether everybody just entered a single word as search
term or these are the cumulated stats per word? Because I think, the
actual combination of them would be more thrilling to read.

Angsuman made a good point that only if many repetitive queries are used then it would be advantageous.  I just wondered
whether it would make WP more scalable for larger applications.  I also thought it could potentially increase security.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP-Manage: Automatic WP backups and upgrades with PHP
Message-ID: <1169215994.6923.38.camel@localhost>

Hi all,

I developed a management package for WordPress, which will handle
backups and upgrades at the push of a button. It is called WP-Manage.

On this list and over at wp-testers, we have recently talked about such
solutions implemented as shell scripts. But this one is entirely in PHP
and plugs directly into WordPress (it's not a plugin, though).

The Backup creates a MySQL dump of the WP tables, gathers all WP files
and puts all this stuff into a nice zip file. The Upgrade downloads the
latest WordPress, unpacks it, deletes the old files and inserts the new
ones. All these actions don't require funky PHP extensions -- they are
all handled by the WP-Manage package, together with some nice
third-party-libs.

The backup and the upgrade routine are independent from each other, and
it is to say that the upgrade feature might not be the right thing for
every one. But e.g. if you installed WordPress for a friend or a
customer with no knowledge of FTP, PHP and MySQL, you might find an
ideal solution in this upgrade feature.

Documentation, screenshots and downloads are available at the WP-Manage
homepage <http://www.zirona.com/software/wp-manage>. I would really love
to hear what you think of it.


Best regards
Alex

Yes, I'm aware of this. But as soon you run the upgrade, the files in
wp-admin/ and wp-includes/ (and the WP files in the base directory) are
taken over by the webserver and will be protected again. This is why I
recommend to only make them writable directly before running the upgrade
routine for the first time (see under "Security" on the homepage).

Fair point but the amount of manual labor required just to be able to  
use the tool each time sort of defeats the purpose. Once someone  
manages 10 blogs or more, having to change perms on these folders  
each time is counter-productive.

Just playing devil's advocate as one of the guys who produced one of  
those shell scripts that take care of all the upgrading.

Well, I don't share this opinion. All in all it's just some clicks in
your FTP client, which should be able to change directories' permissions
recursively. That really shouldn't take more than 5 minutes. If you e.g.
install WordPress for a customer, you make this once and can have him
handle updates and backups all by himself.

Sure, why not. :-) I myself have proposed such a solution recently
(http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-January/010267.html), and I'm happily using it on my server. But I also have customers on other servers, and I wanted to find a solution for people who don't have shell access. Of course, the upgrade feature has its downsides, but it proves extremely useful when it comes to preparing WordPress to be handled by novice users.

Alex

Matt, can we get one produced for wp.com?  Would help in rewriting the
FAQ as we would see what's being looked for?

What's this on wp-hackers for?  I would think wp-forums would be better.

Thanks,

First and foremost, for a long time, in WP support, the de rigeur was to not
touch wp-contents.  I don't know who and what changed that, so I don't know
why or how... In Mac, if you want to overwrite something in a directory, you
are prompted "an older item exists, do you want to overwrite", so, there's a
fail safe... but without knowing...no merge of content..

So long story short, I still stand by the opinion that leave wp-content
alone, unless release notes mention a change to a bundled plugin/theme
(which right now is akismet (opinion withheld/ default (god forbid that's
upgraded...))

I specifically had hoped to clarify why some people think Mac OS X

Oh, I got customers of this sort as well. :-)

However, if you as web developer install a WP blog for somebody, then
all your mom needs to do for an upgrade is the following:

1. Log in to her WordPress account*
2. Go to www.example.com/wp-manage
3. Click "Start upgrade".

* If she isn't admin, give her the "import" capability via RoleManager.

How could it be easier? Or would you (your employees) do it yourself
each time? Or don't you do the upgrades and backups at all, leaving it
to the customer? Please enlighten me. ;-)

As I mentioned before, I also know and apprechiate the shell script
method. But this one is a different approach. By the way, there is also
the mysqldump command line tool, still do people use phpMyAdmin and the
WP-Backup plugin. ;-)

I was going to stay out as I had made my comments but there's just  
something else I need to say. :-) All in the spirit of dialogue, right?

This tool assumes you're responsible for the upgrades, right? I'm not  
clear on this.

If you are responsible for the upgrades then you have to manually  
login (via FTP, SSH whatever) to change perms. Then you run the  
script. Then you log back in and change perms again. Theoretically  
you remember all the various passwords, but perhaps you don't and  
have to fish around through emails or god forbid find the password on  
the post it note taped to the bottom of your keyboard. My point is  
that this is not really an efficient way even if it just is a right  
click, properties, chmod 777.

Being that I'm not clear if this is intended for the person  
responsible for all the upgrades (i.e. you) or if it's left to Dr.  
Mike's soccer moms to do, let's take the other approach. The soccer  
mom's have to upgrade. Okay, so now how do you teach THEM to chmod  
their directories and then chmod them back when they are done.

I don't want to ruin your enthusiasm. I love options and I love  
Brian's script and the idea behind yours. Anything that makes  
automation better is the way to go in my book. I live this philosophy  
and am always learning new things. So don't misunderstand me.

With the shell script, assuming you are the one responsible for all  
these upgrades on different servers, why can't you just modify a  
script (or write your own) that uses PHP's FTP functions. Then you  
can automate the whole thing with a click of the button and you don't  
have to worry about the soccer mom's screwing things up, or having to  
go through and remember passwords, click around, maybe click on the  
wrong things, etc. It eliminates the fallible human modus operandi  
(which I'm thrilled to have used in a sentence for the second time  
this week) that makes mistakes.

Food for thought.

Aaron,

Maybe I'm not clear on this, but it seems to me that he said  
(multiple times) that you only need to change the perms the *first  
time* You keep taking about changing, upgrading, and changing back  
and I think this is not the case. That would be more useless than  
doing a manual upgrade.

I think he clearly stated that you open the permissions the first  
time, the web server takes over as owner and grants only itself write  
permission so it's not open globally. Thereafter, any time you go in  
and click "upgrade" the script has the correct permissions to run,   
yet it's still secure from outside sources having write access to  
those folders.


Quoting Alex:
"Yes, I'm aware of this. But as soon you run the upgrade, the files in
wp-admin/ and wp-includes/ (and the WP files in the base directory) are
taken over by the webserver and will be protected again. This is why I
recommend to only make them writable directly before running the upgrade
routine for the first time (see under "Security" on the homepage)."

Maybe a quick glance over http://www.zirona.com/software/wp- 
manage#security would be useful

Absolutely! I totally appreciate the constructive critisism. :-)

Not nesseccarily. See, a common situation is the following: I have a
customer who wants a blog. It is very likely that he already has a
website and a hosting solution, but of course no shell access (which
would make those shell solutions interesting). So I make his blog with
all the odds and ends, and then the job is basically done. Now time goes
by and there are critical WordPress updates. I look around and I see
there are a couple of WP blogs around which I have once set online,
hence I would have to take care as a responsible professional. Now what
to do? Either I tell people that there is a critical update and I don't
care anymore or I do the upgrades for every single of them the classical
way (to be honest, I've got other things to do). Or -- with WP-Manage --
I send an e-mail to everybody and tell them to perform the three steps I
mentioned before (log in and make two clicks).

No, you only change the permissions once, the moment you install
WP-Manage. Directly after that, you execute the upgrade routine (you can
even do this when no new version is available, it doesn't hurt). Then
the files will belong to the webserver and you won't need to touch them
ever again unless you want to modify some core files manually.
Everything else is handled by WP-Manage. Note that wp-content/ and
wp-config.php, as well as all other non-WP-files, are never touched by
WP-Manage, so your user can even install themes/plugins or upload stuff
as he likes.

As I said, if you install the blog for them, you do this once when
installing. However, I do see that we might talk about different
situations. If you provide the hosting anyway, and you take care of the
updates (e.g. with one of those shell scripts), then WP-Manage is
pointless for you.

The problems with the permissions is that there are different
Users/Groups. If you as WP user have the user account user123 in group
ftp, and the webserver is apache:apache, then (a) the chmodding is
mandatory for the whole thing to work, and (b) PHP's ftp functions won't
work. This is because although they might be able to change the files'
permissions (given they already have write access to them), but they
will not be able to change the _ownership_, because that's a thing only
root can do. The only way to gain ownership of a file is to delete and
re-create it. And that's what WP-Manage does as soon you make the files
0666 and execute the upgrade routine.

Of course there are solutions like SuPHP (www.suphp.org) and others
which make scripts being executed with the ftp user's uid/gid. But when
you have those this case it's anyway not required to play around with
permissions.

However, I'm always looking for ways to improve my works and skills. So
as I said, all constructive critisism will help me, I'm thankful for any
input. :-)

Alex

Just to remind us developers what everyday people who come to 
wordpress.org are looking for. It's nice to take a step back from 
getting status headers to work on IIS and consider the bigger picture.

I think it could potentially help with both, but in the meantime we've 
done our best to address security and performance problems at a lower 
level. However I think there is a lot of room for improvement still, 
especially with regards to performance and caching.

As I've been looking at this, one thing jumped out at me (probably out 
of ignorance on my part). The first is why are attachments referenced 
with attachment_id= instead of p=? The post_type is easily identified in 
the query so a special query string doesn't seem to be needed.

Regardless, how practical would it be to add some sort of registration 
function that plugins could use for adding additional post types?

Thanks Matt.  I can probably come up with a top 10 of what gets asked
but we'll never know what folks are find answers for over there.

Just curious.  Was rather surprised to see it on this list.  I know
folks seem to try to keep things on the correct lists.

I think the real takeaway from this is to actually try those searches,
and make sure that each of them is returning meaningful results within
a single click. For example, the search for "wp_list_cats" is not
particularly helpful; it's not obvious which link is the appropriate
one, and some are most definitely not at all useful. In that case,
perhaps it's worth hacking in a onebox-style result at the top that
says "Looking to style your navigation and category lists? Check out
this page: http://codex.wordpress.org/Good_Navigation_Links"

Seeing as plugin/plugins is the pretty much a #2 query, it might be
worth someone's while to straighten up the Plugins landing page on the
wiki. Valuable above-the-fold space is going to useless information
about compatibility and which default plugins ship with WP. How about
moving the "What are plugins?" info (and external repos) into a
right-floated box, and then putting a top-ten "Matt Recommends" list
or something into the top area, followed by the breakdown by category.

The Themes wikipage is in better shape, but it's kind of overwhelming.
Maybe some kind of featured "theme of the week" or something would be
more interesting. (Like, if the newbie can figure out how to install
this week's theme, they might feel more ambitious about trying some
random one out of the list...)

Anyhow, just my 0.002 cents. (I'm just a plugin dev and lurker...)

Subject: [wp-hackers] filtering posts
Message-ID: <502026.29011.qm@web37815.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I posted this question to wordpress.org, but I figured
that many of the people on this list may not bother to
look there.

For my plugin to work right, I need to be able to
filter out posts when the Wordpress loop is called. My
plugin is called before the loop, which will set the
conditions for what should be filtered.

add_filter does not seem to be the right fit for the
job. Using add_filter causes filtering to occur
EVERYWHERE even if my plugin is not called. add_filter
also filters results before the loop, which does not
allow my plugin the chance to decide what needs to be
filtered out.

I had the thought that maybe I could alter
$wp_query->posts to get what I need, but I'm not sure
what the right way to do that would be. I've been
studying the $wp_query class but it's rather daunting
and Google hasn't provided a good example to follow
yet.

I've been banging my head against the wall on this one
for a couple of weeks now and I'd love some help.
Suggestions?

Thanks!

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to determine which WordPress version is running ?
Message-ID: <002901c73c8b$43294f90$c97beeb0$@no>

Hi,

 

In my plugin, I need to determine which WordPress version it's installed on.
What is the best method for doing this ?

 

Using # $wp_version ? Or using function_exists on a function I now only
exist in WordPress 2.1 or later ? i.e. function_exists('wp_print_scripts')

 

Kind regards,

Per

How about <?php get_bloginfo('version') ?> ;-)

I find this to be best:


global $wp_db_version;
if ( 3664 <= $wp_db_version ) die('Your version is too low.'); // Change the
"3664" to whatever revision you wanna check for


Unlike $wp_version, $wp_db_version is always an integer with no letters
making it the easiest to compare to. You can also go exactly to the revision
number which added the needed function (so that'll it'll work on new beta
builds on 2.1, but not old beta builds).

Is there a list showing the revision numbers vs wp version ?

Thanks for the reply, but this isn't quite what I
need. Your plugin relies on knowing what data to
filter before the page loads. I need to be able to
decide what data to filter as the page is loading.
That is, the most important test will be: has my
plugin been called? If it's been called, alter the
data; if it hasn't been called, don't alter the data.

Set a global variable in your plug-in so later you can check it and
farkle with in the posts_where filter.

Another option that I use is to create your own query_var and pass it as
a parameter to the page, but from the info you provide isn't complete
enough to understand the exact situation.

This is not nuclear physics, it's all in the code.  Just step through it
in a debugger and you can see what's happening, when filters are called,
even how WP itself handles similar situations to your own.

One of the best is to watch what happens when standard archive queries
are done (e.g. by date).  This tells you a lot about how WP handles this
itself.  You can then do thou likewise.

add_filter seems to get processed before anything gets
called on a template. So, if my plugin is called on
the template, nothing that I do within my plugin will
effect the add_filter function that I set up. I tried
setting up a global variable and was losing my mind
trying to understand why it wasn't working. I echo'd
the variable and the modified $where statement that
was supposed to be happening through add_filter and
could not understand why my variable was showing up on
it's own but not in the function I had set-up through
add_filter... until I realized that the add_filter had
happened a long time ago. :)

add_filter cannot, it seems, be called from within a
function either. So, I can't have my plugin get called
and then have add_filter run then. That would work
fine! But it's not possible. :(

What needs to happen:

page loads -> plugin called? -> yes -> grab IDs of
posts to display, eliminate all others -> run loop

page loads -> plugin called? -> no -> run loop

Your suggestion of setting up a debugger is a good
one. I've been working on this plugin for a year and
I'm embarrassed to admit I've never used one. :) That
sounds helpful. Thanks.

I just ran this as a test and it worked. Anyone see
any problems with doing something like this? I'm
hesitant to use $wp_query but this seems to do exactly
what I need.

select_posts($wp_query->posts);

function select_posts($all_posts) {
$all_posts[0] = NULL;
foreach ($all_posts as $key => $value) {
if ($value == NULL) unset($all_posts[$key]);
}
array_values($all_posts);
return $all_posts;
}

I've been trying to fix ticket #3100 which should be easy, but I'm having
some issues.  It concerns the alt attribute being filled with the file name
when no title is put in.  The behavior should be that nothing is put in
there, but I don't understand how it's being truncated to fill in the title.
I know the title is being set on line 49 on upload-js.php:

this.currentImage.title = ( 0 == id ? '' : $('attachment-title-' + id).value
);

Thoughts?  Thanks, Chris

Subject: [wp-hackers] Enhance WP to use page categories
Message-ID: <45B374B8.7030809@ntlworld.com>

Hello,
Wordpress has expanded from a straight blog app. to include the very 
useful static pages etc. This seems to me (a newbie to Wordpress, but 
experienced in PHP/MySQL etc) to allow the opportunity to create 
complete web-sites which have a consistent theme throughout, many static 
pages, and _part_ of the site includes blog/news and comments etc. This 
would make Wordpress a really useful and more generic tool!

However, it does not seem possible to categorize pages so that there is 
a "public view" accessible to all, and a "members" view, which might 
include the public view, but also show more restricted pages.
In $wpdb the wp_posts.post_category is only used for posts at present 
(and in version 2.1???) - could it also be used for page categories?
A solution might be to create categories for the static pages (e.g. 
public, members), and then give menus of pages based on status of 
logged-in/not logged in.(i.e. the page category)

Has this already been done? Is there any change in 2.1 that would render 
this idea incompatible? (as I wish to implement it for a club website I 
am building)
Thanks
Chris

Hi Guys,
I intending to use the inbuilt cron feature of wordpress 2.1 but i can't find any examples of it.
 
I tried the following code, but it will not work. Any ideas?
 
add_action('test', 'test');function test() { global $wpdb; $wpdb->query("INSERT INTO test VALUES(".current_time('timestamp').")");}//wp_clear_scheduled_hook('test');
if (!wp_next_scheduled('test')) { wp_schedule_event(time(), 'hourly', 'test');}Thanks =D

Message-ID: <f1cf41430701211350v2a3d0c56p758a5bdba90a5b97@mail.gmail.com>

Greets:

I know that this is a WPMU question but I'm going to throw it out
anyway and hope someone nibbles.

Anyone have a method of optimizing a very large amount of tables with
a MySQL database?  Say about 8k of them?

I thought about kicking out a list of the tables into a txt file and
then using an editor like UltraEdit to make each line into a MySQL
command and putting the output into a PHP file and running that but I
would rather have something I can point folks to in the WPMu forums
and say "Do this" instead of having to explain how to come up with a
list of table names.

Thanks,
-drmike

	error
Message-ID: <45B3EBBB.6030506@bdisfunctional.net>

Hi,

Can somebody explain to me where I need to check the nonce with 
check_admin_referrer? The way I do this now gives me 'headers already 
sent errors' when I test it by using the protected link outside the 
admin. So I suppose the nonce is working almost except for the headers 
already sent error. Perhaps somebody can shed some light on this?

Could the problem be that you're scheduling the first event to be
right now (using time() ), instead of in the future?  It may be that
by the time the event gets scheduled, it's already in the past, so you
would need to wait an hour for the next interval to occur.

I would probably use mysqlcheck:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/mysqlcheck.html

You can specify -o for optimize and then specify the database name or 
specify -A for all databases.

On second thought, isn't it resetting the first execution time to the
recent past every time WordPress loads?

It needs to be used before any content is sent so that it can display a "are
you sure" form if the nonce doesn't match.

After much searching around on Google and in the forums this morning I
still haven?t come up with a solution. I have wordpress installed on
http://mumbles.homeip.net/john/wordpress/ and it looks fine when im
viewing locally but when someone tries to view it by said address the
style sheet dose not show up and all the links are to my local machines
name.

Any ideas how to fix this? So it both works on line and when my Internet
is down/dead?


Meet up?
And I think menza is coming to London in the summer. dose anyone want to
do a London meet up? Caius said he's coming, and ill be there. Anyone
else?

Please use the support forums for things like this. It's been covered many
times before and is simply a basic support question. ;)

You need to set the URLs in your options area to
http://mumbles.homeip.net/john/wordpress/.

Hi,
Make sure the blog url (in wp admin -> options) is set to the  
external url, and not to 'localhost'

Keep in mind that the $wp_db_version doesn't always change with a new
release. The 2.0.3 and 2.0.4 releases shared the same db version for
instance.

Yes, but it's useful for checking if the DB is at the version you need :). I
would rely on $wp_version IMO.

Anybody have any thoughts on this at all? I can't find anything 
documented on adding new post_types. In addition I was hoping someone 
could confirm whether feed problem with attachments is a bug.

Thx,
Bill

Congratulations on 2.2!

With the release date for 2.2 set for April 23rd, I propose that we
only target/incorporate the nastiest problems in maintenance releases
(2.1.1) otherwise we will burn through our days of 2.2 .

Now that we have two release versions (2.0.x and 2.1.x), how is the database
version numbering going to be done? In the past, the database version was
just the revision number.

However, if we stick with that, a 2.0.x release could have a higher database
version than 2.1 final. This would reek havoc on the upgrade script and some
plugins.

So are we just going to +1 v2.0.x from now on or something?

Okay, my revised suggestion:

if ( version_compare($wp_version, '2.1') == -1 ) die('Your version is too
low!');

2.0.x is being maintained but that does not mean it will get new
features. There shouldn't be any schema changes for maintenance
purposes, so this shouldn't be an issue.

I personally like to pass the third (optional) comparison param to  
version_compare().  When you do this, version_compare() returns true/ 
false (instead of the confusing -1, 0, 1).  No benefit other than  
readability.

<?php
global $wp_version;
if ( version_compare($wp_version, '2.1', '<') )
	die('Your version is too low!');
?>

Note that the direction of the comparison param is just as if it were  
moved to the left, inbetween the first and second param.

I prefer to check for functionality instead for version. I also do that when
I code javascript, as recommended by pkk [1] 

I ended up using: if (function_exists('wp_print_scripts')) {}

Kind regards,

But what if you aren't looking for a function and instead something like a
hook? ;)

Message-ID: <c28e53ae0701230846w3c3804cayc2405a0c405fa5af@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been using admin_footer filter to add a button to the quicktag.

add_filter('admin_footer', 'aldopw_quicktag');

But, the quicktags are not added on post-new.php
They work fine however, when I edit the post, i.e. post.php

I've faced this with 2.1 and now with 2.2 bleeding as well.

Any solution on how I get this fixed?

My plugins lose the quicktags in 2.1 onwards because of this :(

Thanks,
Ajay

So 2.0.x is in feature freeze, and all active development will be 2.1 and
2.2? Just bugfixes and security fixes for 2.0?

A  month or so ago I raised an issue which causes CSS  files
not  to  be  delivered/used on occasions, and  admin  to  be
logged  off. Until the admin logs in again, the blog appears
'stripped down'.

While  we  discovered  that my blogs were not the  only  one
suffering  from  this (been fine for years,  problems  began
over  a month ago), we never found a solution. At least  two
people  in  this  mailing list had the same  problem.  As  I
browse the Web I continue to find more sites that apparently
suffer from the same issue, e.g.:

http://www.betadot.com/news/2006/20/linux-no-gplv3.html (no CSS at the  
time of writing)

Compare with:

Look at the style being used:
http://www.betadot.com/wp-content/themes//style.css

It seems that something might just be missing there....


http://www.betadot.com/wp-content/themes/betadot/style.css  is consistent
with the theme they have selected and works fine.

So, why is the theme missing from that line.  Is the variable uninitialized
or cleared?

This is the only reference to themes// in that source is:
	<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 2.0" /> <!-- leave this
for stats please -->
	<style type="text/css" media="screen">
		@import url(
http://www.betadot.com/wp-content/themes//style.css );
	</style>

So, it is probably only a problem with the header.

A glance at the code shows the issue could be with 
bloginfo('stylesheet_directory') or 
bloginfo('stylesheet_url') 
And which one is to be used, depends upon theme implementation in
header.php.

What does the theme that you had active use?

Why not use edit_page_form and edit_form_advanced ?

Is there any reason why the below code would not work in 2.1?

<?php query_posts('cat=-26'); ?>

Thanks for any help.

Hi Brian,

Have a look at:  
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-December/010008.html

There  are  followups  as well. I have the same  problem  in
several  independent  Web sites. Others have  reported  that
they suffer from this problem as well.

The  themes and the setups (including versions of Apache and
WordPress)   are   not  the  same.  Personally,  I   use   a
heavily-modified  version  of  WP 1.2.1. I  don't  get  this
problem  in  some  of the other blogs. What's  most  awkward
about  this  is  the  fact that nothing  has  been  changed,
neither  on  the server (e.g. upgrades) nor the  code  (e.g.
plugins).  The example that I listed and you refer to  above
is  not one which I looked at carefully, so it might be best
to ignore it.

I was hoping that someone else has found a  solution by now.
I am  fairly  confident that  there's a  quick fix, but  who
knows where to get started?

Many thanks,

Roy

Personally, I've no idea why. I'm using something very like it on my
blog's home page right now, and don't see an issue with the category
being excluded (that is, it is).

Any thoughts, fellow Peanut gallery members?

Remeber it going by but never was resolved (unless it was and I didn't see

That was resolved, Ryan. After playing around with that, I narrowed it
down as well as I could and reported it here:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3598

About 8 seconds later, Ryan Boren committed a fix here:
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4754

That particular fix is in 2.1 final, but I don't know if there's any
relevance to the problem at hand.

Thanks for getting back. This was a forums question so I'll go back and ask
all the relevent questions (disable all plugins? etc.). Just wanted to make
sure. Thanks.

That's the idea. :)

2.2 is already seeing some action.

Message-ID: <2258bcf80701232239l45c6a60ei82138171acbd9ed6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi every body*
*I am a loyalty WordPress user.  I have just found a problem when I useWP-Cache
2.0.22, combine with your plugin *WP-PostViews 1.10**
*The problem is that WP-Cache has a mission to generate static page, then
users will access to it without querying, then WP-PostView can not update
the new information until the new"real" page could be generated.

I tried the function:
<!--mfunc the_views() -->
<?php the_views() ?>
<!--/mfunc-->

but not effect either

Is there anyway to overcome this issue.

WP-Cache cold be found here:
http://www.mnm.uib.es/gallir/*wp-cache*-2/

WP-PostView 1.10 could be found here:
http://www.lesterchan.net/portfolio/programming.php

Best Regards
Thank you very much

Hi Viper,

Thanks for the reply.

edit_page_form and edit_form_advanced don't work either. I'm using the Edit
Button Framework from http://www.asymptomatic.net/wp-hacks

Any suggestions how to add the button to quicktags? It works on the edit
post, so is something missing from post-new.php ??

Regards,
Ajay

Why not use ButtonSnap? I believe it replaced that Edit Button Framework.

Hi everyone,

Sorry to post yet another message regarding this subject but I haven't 
received any responses and I wanted to find out if this is because 
nobody has an answer or because it's not making it to the list.

It's making it to the list. Sorry I don't have anything to contribute on this.

Thx. I just wanted to confirm that there wasn't something with my mail 
server that was causing them to get filtered.

No need. post_type is a varchar in the DB, not an enum.

I would implement this in terms of the hierarchy.

You could a have a base page with a slug like "/private/" so that
pages like "/private/secrets" would be inaccessible. You'd just have
to have a plugin that ran at boot time and dumped you to the login
screen if you didn't have authorization to view the given stem.

As for the question about static pages, it's fully possible to wrap
your theme around *any* content you like, even dynamic stuff, or
something you wouldn't want to enter through the editor. For example,
we have source code views that look like this:

http://googlemapsbook.com/chapter6/onResize/map_functions.js.source#l6-10

If you strip off the ".source" portion, it displays a plain JavaScript
file sitting on the server. But ".source" funnels it into a Wordpress
plugin page that shows the arbitrary content---in this case,
prettily-rendered source code.

If there's general interest in how to do this, I'd be happy to publish
a tutorial.

The only thing that I can think is that this will mess up the  
category post counts, although there might be other side effects.   
One other way to do this would be via Custom Fields (i.e. the $wpdb- 
 >postmeta table).  This would allow you to set flags on the pages  
that determine private/public status.  You could have this assigned  
automatically if a page is a child of a "private" ultimate parent  
page (just use get_page() and crawl up the $page->post_parent ladder  
until you reach the top and then do an ID comparison).  this might  
end up being more future proof.

Hi Mark,
thanks for reply!
re category counts - yes, looks like would affect those but they could 
be excluded fairly easily I guess.
I have since looked at a plug-in released recently called 
"wp-group-restriction".
Allows hierarchy etc. for Pages.
Only a beta version, with a few buggy bits but I think has (from looking 
at the db and php code) couple of disadvantages,
namely relies on FKey relationships and sub-queries, so InnoDB and MySQL 
later versions - rest of wp code looks like wpress are trying to keep it 
generic ( i.e for MyISAM and lower versions of MySQL too).

What is the WordPress "view" on versions of (A)MP?

Thanks again
Chris
P.S. for my current site I have simply constructed a page hierarchy to 
suit, plus a bit of php code to check login status and show parts of the 
tree for visitors/members (i.e. logged in or not).

My post levels plugin sets the post status to private* and relies on a
custom field to determine who can see it -- I've definitely had future
proofing issues (the plugin gets broken every major, and some minor, release
of WP).

I've figured out how to use the query filter to change the necessary sql to
get category counts, archives, pages, etc to work -- but it's quite hacky.

Takeaway: Using post_status was not the path of least resistance :)   But it
does ensure that private posts aren't shown if the plugin gets disabled

New page on WordPress.org for everyone:

http://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/

This lists a zip and tar.gz download for every known release.

There is also a md5 for each release.

The URLs are a lot more sane now, too, and each is the canonical and 
trusted download URL for that release.

       Advisory: Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities in Wordpress
    Advisory ID: 4tphi-sa-20070111-wordpress
   Release Date: 01-24-2007
         Author: Blake Matheny (bmatheny@mobocracy.net)

       Software: WordPress < 2.1

         Impact: Remote & Local DoS, File Disclosure



Overview:

    From Wikipedia, "WordPress is a blog publishing system written in PHP
and backed by a MySQL database."
    
    Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the XMLRPC and Pingback
implementation that are included with Wordpress. Note that some issues
discovered with Pingback affect other vendors as well. Please see
the following advisory for details: 4tphi-sa-20070111-pingback



Details:

    WordPress is vulnerable to the attacks described in the pingback
advisory. In testing, a single PC on a T1 connection was able to cripple
two dual Xeon apache servers on separate 100Mb connection. This was
accomplished by sending out multiple requests to server A specifying a
sourceURI on server B that was a 1GB media file. This attack utilizes
resources on server A and server B, but not the malicious users machine.

    Additionally, WordPress does not sanitize the sourceURI before passing
it to wp_remote_fopen(); This makes it possible to specify non-HTTP
resources to be read such as local files or ftp sources. In particular, a
malicious user can determine whether certain files exist on the local file
system. For example, the following request would help determine the
version of Linux being used:
    <methodCall>
        <methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>
        <params>
            <param>
                <value><string>/etc/SuSE-release</string></value>
            </param>
            <param>
                <value><string>http://b.example.com/#p</string></value>
            </param>
        </params>
    </methodCall>
If this file does not exist, fault 16 (source URI does not exist) will be
returned and if it does exist it is likely that fault 17 (source URI does
not contain a link to the target URI) will be returned. This works
whether curl or the fopen() stream is used, only the uri has to be
changed. This will not work if the webserver user can not read the file.
    If the administrator has allowed automatic pingbacks to show up as
comments, it is possible for an attacker to have system information
display in that comment. For instance, an attacker could request a url on
the host with the following text in it:
    <title>example</title><a href="valid targetURI">text</a>
If that showed up in the apache access_log or error_log, and the
webserver user had permission to read that file the above XMLRPC request,
after determining the OS, could specify the log as the sourceURI. This
would cause some of the log file to be displayed as a comment. The session
file for PHP would be a good target.



Recommendations:

    Upgrade to Wordpress 2.1. The original recommendations made to the
Wordpress security team can be found below. Please note that Wordpress
still does not check the content type, however the timeout has been set to
10 seconds and as such the impact of binary files is minimized.

    The local file issues can be resolved by ensuring that the URI scheme
is HTTP. This also disallows other resources, such as ftp, from being
read. In order to prevent overly large files from being retrieved, a 
reasonable timeout for curl and fopen should be set. Also, if content is
missing a compatible Content-Type (such as text/xml) it should not be read
as it can not be parsed. The attached patch is one possible solution to
the issues described above. There are some more significant design
problems, particularly with respect to pingback authentication. These are
described in the pingback advisory and are not addressed here, as there
has been no formal specification modification yet.



Disclosure Timeline:

    01-24-2007 - Released
    01-18-2007 - Response from Wordpress. Waiting on release of 2.1 to
                 disclose. Code base includes patch.

Hi,

Best to go to the home of these plugins and see if and how the authors
like to be contacted.

WP 2.1 supports MySQL 4.0 and up, and yeah, we try to keep it as  
generic as possible.

Sorry... (A)MP?  As in LAMP?

Aye... we're aware.  But take heart: in the scheme of things, these  
aren't very useful vulnerabilities.  They can't be used to compromise  
your blog.   2.0.8 will be out eventually.  2.1 has partial fixes  
(with more to come in 2.1.1).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Excluding page from being listed via a plugin
Message-ID: <45B8BD17.4060702@gmail.com>

Hey guys,

I could really use some ideas on this one. Target version is >= 2.0.7 
and I need to exclude some admin-picked pages from being listed on the 
sidebar. I have been looking for hooks other than the wp_list_pages 
filter but couldn't find any. First question is: are there any other 
hooks that I can use for this? Second is: Is it safe to parse the string 
being passed to the function and split them using LI as the separator 
and remove the necessary pages based on the page ID in the link?

Ideas or links will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

This gives me an idea: each of the filters in WP_Query::get_posts()
are completely devoid of context. Including $q or $this as a third
parameter for each filter would make them far more useful. However,
get_pages() doesn't use WP_Query.

The function get_pages() accepts an "exclude" parameter, which is a
comma/space separated list of IDs. You can affect that parameter with
the wp_list_pages_excludes filter.

Cheers,
Andy

Same idea as MU, slightly different implementation.

That post is from last year, when MU and Lyceum went public around the 
same time. The main difference between Lyceum and MU is that Lyceum puts 
everything into monolithic tables where MU has a different set of tables 
for each blog. (In MU some tables are global, such as users.)

I believe the chief argument for the former at the time was that 
multiple tables wouldn't scale. So far multiple tables have worked well 
up to 626k blogs, who knows beyond that.

Now that we have the DB query filter, I wonder if you could do much of this
with a plugin.  You'd have to do something weird to get separate plugins for
each blog and perhaps reload some of the options for the blogs... But much
of the code could probably be moved into a plugin that dynamically alters
the queries as they come through...

You totally could, you could probably do it so it works with plugins too.

Ah, the things we could do if we didn't have to waste time sleeping and
eating...  What an annoyance! 

Then again, I'm still at at work after 15 hours for the third day this week.
Another 6 hours probably wouldn't help the situation...

I'm still trying to get time to post something about the 2.1 release and
mention the fixes I put into my script...

Watch out for this guy...  Pretty sneaky...

Here's his spam comment:
"I always have terrible trouble with comment-related plugins that require me
to put some line in the comment loop; I can never seem to find the right
spot. Can anyone tell me where I should put the php line in my comments
loop? I haven not modified anything much, and I would be very grateful.
Thanks!"

Unfortunately it also comes with random email addresses and a link that goes
to a cheap pharmaceuticals site.  As if wp hacker would prescription drugs
from one of their spammers...  Akismet isn't catching it yet.  So if you got
any of these, don't waste your time with a reply

so far, "tramadol" is the most common triggered keyword.

Suggest putting your pages into a good hierarchy, then can exclude then 
just using the top of that tree and the normal WP functions

Subject: [wp-hackers] Version Maintenance
Message-ID: <45B649FC.30201@gunters.org>

Since we're now maintaining the 2.0 branch for an extended time,
alongside 2.1, and we presumably will be maintaining 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2
simultaneously in the future, don't we need to modify the wordpress.org
downloads page to reflect the availability of these branches?

I thought of this when I was getting ready to update the WordPress entry
for freshmeat.net. I want set up these different version tracks as

download URLs and such for the specific versions. We *have* those URLs,
but they just aren't documented well on the primary web site. The

While we're updating the download info, do we want to point at the

Oh, and did anybody ever send a release notification to the

(I tried to send this yesterday, but it didn't appear to go through.
Apologies if this is a duplicate)

Since we're now maintaining the 2.0 branch for an extended time,
alongside 2.1, and we presumably will be maintaining 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2
simultaneously in the future, don't we need to modify the wordpress.org
downloads page to reflect the availability of these branches?

I thought of this when I was getting ready to update the WordPress entry
for freshmeat.net. I want set up these different version tracks as
branches on FreshMeat, but to do that, I need to be able to point at
download URLs and such for the specific versions. We *have* those URLs,
but they just aren't documented well on the primary web site. The

I believe 2.1 is the recommended version while 2.0.x will be like 1.5.x was
-- security fixes and minor bug fixes, but nothing new content wise.

But yes IMO, there should be a new, separate page (as to not encourage it's
new use) for 2.0.x for those who don't want to upgrade.

1.5 was never officially maintained (there was a further maintenance  
update due to the size of the security hole, and the number of people  
still using 1.5).

2.0 is going to be officially maintained, and have bug fixes and  
security fixes. It should, in theory, be more stable than the latest  
bleeding-edge release, as it'll be more heavily tested.

I don't think there are any plans to maintain 2.1 for 5 years like we're 
maintaining 2.0, since we're going to be releasing more often we should 
probably pick a version a few after this one (2.3?) to put on a 
long-term maintenance cycle.

Currenly, this function searches by default in "wp-content/plugin/"
folder. This makes the this folder to have too many files and mess up
the theme management. Each theme should be autocontained in just one
folder, its folder. So all translations files should be included in
its folder and not in the main plugin folder shared by all pluggins.
It is just nonsense. To fix this issue there are two main posibilities
here:

- make the default search in "wp-content/plugin/[the plugin]/" which
will still mess up the plugin folder if it has many translations.

- make the default search in "wp-content/plugin/[the
plugin]/languages/" where all the languages of [the plugin] will be
contained. I selected the folder name "languages" to keep on with the
same nomenclature used in "wp-includes/languages/". This will force
the themes creators to create a folder named "languages" which is not
bad at all, providing a main protocol of how to create a theme.

This issue was tried to be discussed in the trac[1], but it was
redirected to [2] which is not a solution at all and makes more mess
up. I will also recommend to revert the [2] patch, because making the
language folders variable is not dessiderable and makes the theme
creator to write too much duplicated code in his files.

If we achieve here a consensus I will post it in the bug tracker.
Thanks and happy blogging! :)

It'd be good to have about 6-12 months of overlap between announcing  
the date for 2.0.x discontinuation and 2.y.x stability commitment.   
People still on 2.0.x at that time will be looking for long term  
stability, so we'll want to provide a nice safe upgrade path for them  
that they'll have time to complete.

And agreed, if we're going to release every few months, we can't be  
supporting every version indefinitely.  We can make the best choice  
when 2.0.x is preparing to ride off into the sunset and have that be  
the stable version for a few years.

If we're needing a new release in around 4 years time, does 3.0 (if  
not 4.0) really seem that impossible to be the next long term support  
version?

Depends on how stable it is.  Couldn't possibly predict it this far  
out.  Maybe it'll be WordPress XP! (sorry, running gag)

Hi David,

There is already load_theme_textdomain() for this purpose, defined as follows:

  89
  90  function load_theme_textdomain($domain) {
  91      $locale = get_locale();
  92
  93      $mofile = get_template_directory() . "/$locale.mo";
  94      load_textdomain($domain, $mofile);
  95  }
  96

Hope this helps,

Cheers,

Jamie.

proposal for the new (to WP2.1) hierarchial link category system.

I am trying to find the proposal to justify it agains the changes in

2.1 to decide if this is a 'bug,' or something else.

This is as close to a proposal as we have:

Changes in behavior for the old template functions is most likely a bug.

Thx for the link.  This is what I figured.

I'm sure that the folks who blessed the new bookmark system have some idea
of exactly where the feature is falling down in the field, but rather than
submit duplicates or tilting at windmills I figured it was worth my time to
do the homework.

I mixed up themes and plugins. Sorry for the fast writing. I just meaned the
plugins issue, because themes have already the
load_theme_textdomain($domain) as Jamie Talbot said. I repeat my email with
the corrections.

Currenly, this function searches by default in "wp-content/plugin/"
folder. This makes the this folder to have too many files and mess up
the plugin management. Each plugin should be autocontained in just one
folder, its folder. So all translations files should be included in

Got a few comments, with this half witty text.
Passes Akismet, but certainly not my human moderation ;)
So far completely unrelated to the posts it pretends to comment.
Not to mention the plurality.

Does anyone know if someone has written re-use of the supplied

It seems such a waste to re-supply it when it's already sitting

What's hilarious is that i got dozens, maybe hundreds of the same comment. 
They go out of their way to make the comment look super real, and then 
send the same comment hundreds of times to the same blog? Akismet didn't 
let a single one through.

That's what's nice about a "learning" system.  What's a problem for a while,
won't be for long.

Hello,

    I upgraded from WP 1.5.2 to WP2.1 and it broke several of my 
.htaccess file's rewrite rules.  This has killed two of the most 
popular feeds on my site, as well as several "index" pages.  I can't 
seem to properly add a filter to the rewrite_rules_array via a 
plugin, since it runs on the "Permalinks" admin page with no apparent 
effect (I know it's running because I threw in a 'die' to find out 
where it was running) but not on actual URLs in the public site. 
Basically, I have no idea why things are breaking the way they are. 
(For that matter, I can't tell why WP needs to re-implement 
mod_rewrite, but since I'm now stuck in 2.x land, that's pretty much 
blood over the dam.)
    So are there any good, clear guides to translating .htaccess rules 
into the new rewrite structure?  I read the WP_Rewrite function 
reference on the Codex, and it didn't help.  I also Googled about, 
but on all the pages I found, nothing anyone recommended seemed to 
work.
    Alternatively, if someone wants to take me by the hand and lead me 
through the big, scary woods of rewriting, I'm up for that. 
Considering my all-posts feeds (both full-content and summary) as 
well as my linkblog and the main page of my post archive are all 404, 
some in really fascinating ways, I'll take whatever help I can get.
    See http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/01/29/wp-21-breakage/ 
if you want a vaguely more detailed description of what's going 
wrong.  Otherwise, ask.  Thanks.

The rules aren't updated live (on every load)... they're stored in  
the database.   So once your filter is activated, you'll have to  
either manually update your permalink structure in Options >  
Permalinks or have your plugin update it.

The best place to look for learning how the rewrite_rules_array  
should look is at your rewrite_rules option.

<?php var_dump(get_option('rewrite_rules')); ?>

Also keep in mind that it's generally better to have your more- 
specific custom rules inserted first... so don't append to the end of  
the array -- stick it at the front.

Next, you use the query_vars hook to add your custom query var:

http://wphooks.flatearth.org/hooks/query_vars/

This enable you to access it with get_query_var()

I pasted some basic rewrite-fu code here:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-December/ 
009937.html

Basically, because not everyone has it, and it was a pain having to  
support a internal rewriter AND mod_rewrite.  Lowest common  
denominator.  We don't have to support both and plugins don't have to  
support both.

That said, if you're serving the alternate feed by passing a special  
GET switch to your regular feed, and you're not worried about  
portability to non-mod_rewrite-enabled hosts, you might still be able  
to keep a hardcoded mod_rewrite rule in .htaccess, provided that it  
is put BEFORE the WordPress block.

As an example:

RewriteRule ^rss2/full/$ /index.php/rss2/?full=true [QSA,L]

# WP's internal rewriter block goes here

I ran into this problem as well in 2.x. The problem with the approach  
outlined here is that WP looks at the original query string (not the  
rewritten string) and parses that with the internal rewrite engine.

In the past I've proposed being able to add a special token ("wp- 
ignore-internal-rules=1" or similar) so that WP would look at the GET  
string (modified by my rewrite rules) instead of the original query  
string, but this hasn't been met with much support.

Cheers,

Are you sure you've tried it with:

	(1) the rewrite rule placed before the WP block
	(2) rewriting to /index.php/foo/?whatever=blah (as opposed to /foo/? 
whatever=blah
	(3) [QSA,L]

?

I too have run into issues with this. Two plugins that have helped me are:

1. Custom Rewrite Rules -

e_rules_ver1.zip (mirrored)

2. WordPress internal Rewrite Viewer Plugin -
http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/wordpress-internal-rewrite-viewer-plugin
/

Neither of which I have tested yet for 2.1 although I do use them for 2.0.x.

Also, I found that $matches[n] would work for back referencing whereas $n
and \\n did not work.

Yes. In fact, there was no WP block at all in WP 1.5 in the site I  
ran into this on.

No, I rewrote it to /index.php?pagename=foo

Yes.

I think you may have glossed over the point I was trying to make.

WordPress looks at $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'] and $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']  
- neither of those seem to be properly updated to reflect a rewritten  
URL where $_GET variables do reflect the rewritten URL.

Of course, I ran into these hassles when I upgraded in early 2006:

http://alexking.org/blog/2006/03/11/upgrading-wordpress/
http://alexking.org/blog/2006/03/13/changes-in-wp-20

so my recollection of all this is not particularly recent.

    #3 helped fix a number of my problems, at least in terms of 
returning the actual pages required (HTTP headers may be another 
matter).  For example, 
<http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/recent-links/> works now, as 
opposed to before, when it rewrote to the home page of the site 
rather than show the results of my PHP script.
    Sadly, I still have a couple of problems that won't go away:

    1. The feeds, while they exist and are all working now (hooray!), 
also get the server to return a 404 header, which seems bad.  I'm 
pretty sure that's WP's doing, though I can't be absolutely certain. 
See the results at 
<http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmeyerweb.com%2Feric%2Fthoughts%2Frecent-links%2Frss2> 
as one example.  If you then go to 
<http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/recent-links/rss2> in a browser or 
aggregator, you see the RSS file.  (Unless your aggregator is really, 
really respectful of HTTP headers and won't load anaything reported 
to be a 404.)
    I'm kind of afraid that WP is spitting back a bunch of 404s, so 
that browsers  and search engines think every page in my blog is a 
404 page.  That would be kind of icky.

    2. <http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/> returns a plain old 
WP-generated 404.  I know it's not Apache doing this, because it's 
supposed to serve up a completely different 404 page than the one WP 
generates.  What I believe to be the related rewrite is:

    RewriteRule ^eric/thoughts/$ /eric/thoughts/index.php [QSA,L]

I'm assuming that #2 above has some bearing on this, or maybe it has 
to do with Alex's observations, but shut my mouth and paint me red if 
know how.
    I also have a whole bunch of pretty-permalink rewriting I did on 
my own back in the day, and which I assume I could drop now. 
Hopefully I will, once I sort the rest of this stuff out...

    3. Any 404 on my site (like <http://meyerweb.com/kuhwfs>) now 
rewrites to the home page, in flagrant violation of my .htaccess 
file, where I define site-wide error pages.  I find this to be 
entirely uncool.  How do I stop it?  Change the mod_rewrite stuff for 
WP to have a different base than the site's root?

    I checked in detail and most pages and feeds seem to be returning 
200s, so that's good.  The 404-response exceptions among the feeds 
are:

    <http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/rss2/summary/>
    <http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/rss2/full/>
    <http://meyerweb.com/eric/recent-links/rss2> (as mentioned above)

The other feeds (as listed on <http://meyerweb.com/feeds/>) work fine 
and return 200s; four are WP-generated, and two are not.

>    2. <http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/> returns a plain old 
>WP-generated 404.

    That's still a problem.  Sub-pages of the archive that depend on 
rewriting, like <http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/01/>, work 
just fine.  The archive index page WP-404s whether I try to rewrite 
it or not.

    I tested dropping them, and I either got raw 404s or got WP to 
cough up the pages but using the main template, not the archive 
template.  So I put the rewrites back in, and commented out the WP 
rewrite block entirely.  After which...

    Now that I've taken away the WP rewrite block in the .htaccess 
file, this is no longer an issue.  Non-WP 404s are served as they 
should be.  WP-404s are still served up from WP, which means I have 
two 404 pages, one of which tries to be helpful to the user (hint: 
it's not the WP one), and I still get a WP-404 on the main archive 
page.
    In all, kind of a Charlie Foxtrot situation.

So far the spamming machines are stupid enough, but I guess that in the

Give them a month or two.  They'll find another method soon.

I actually began toying around with Google Auth on Sat in an effort  
to lay the groundwork for a Blogger import. Got frustrated real quick  
as I hate their API and I couldn't wrap my head around how to  
actually get a usable Auth Token...

I'd be willing to collab with someone who has more experience with  
the API...

You could change the installer to use UTF-8 as the database charset, but I
don't know if that would be a complete fix.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Maximum # of users
Message-ID: <45BFDACA.4020602@sub.st>

What's the maximum number of users Wordpress intends to support? User 
IDs in wp_users are stored as BIGINT(20), however while messing about 
with the caching functions I noticed that get_userdata() casts the 
supplied ID to an integer, making ~2 billion the maximum number of users 
possible that Wordpress can handle.

While I don't see anyone ever reaching 2 billion users, I actually see 
this as causing problems if anyone were to ever have more than the max # 
of users signed up. Looking at the code it appears that those users 
having greater than the maximum amount would be locked out.

If the ~2 billion is enough, would it make more sense to reduce that 
column size? Leave it alone? Or get rid of the cast to integer in 
get_userdata() ?

We have to be careful about doing any of this to upgraded
installations.  New install are a different matter.  When creating the
tables we can try things like using ENGINE instead of TYPE for MySQL >
4.0.18 and 4.1.2 and setting CHARACTER SET = utf8 for MySQL > 4.1.

No, don't think it would be, becos if I remember correctly, the default 
charset for MySQL is actually ISO-8559-1 (latin1-swedish)

It would make sense, IMO, to shrink the database column type, as PHP and
more likely the host operating system would have a limit on integer size.

Let's track this with ticket #3517.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3517

I added a patch and a comment.

Bless the new "This is spam" link in WP-generated comment emails in 2.1.

Except... I'm finding that it doesn't always appear. I've had  three  
spams get through Akismet today with no "Spam" link in the emails.  
Anyone else seeing this? I'm baffled.

WordPress 2.0.x can't handle much more than 800-1000 users because of  
the way wp-admin/users.php loads them all onto the same page (you run  
out of memory at this point).  2.1 fixes that and it can scale to at  
least 10,000, but I honestly have no idea what the ceiling is now.  I  
really don't think 2 billion is anything we need to worry about for now.

That's very strange.  There's no logic block.  If one link appears,  
all should.

I think he meant that it's hardly an important matter... not that it should

Do you have a "subscribe to comments" feature?  Sometimes people reply via
email to those comments and they look like comments in your blog.  It is
easy to confuse those emails with real comments.  

Was there a "To delete this comment" link?
