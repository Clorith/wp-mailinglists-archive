Agreed. I've never quite enjoyed looking through the current WP docs.. it
was always troublesome to find something. Especially if I had a vague idea
of what I was looking for, but not exactly.  With the search aspect of it I
can find what i'm looking for way easier :D much appreciated! *bookmarked*

Message-ID: <F1793C1E-5D61-491E-97FC-617C6217786D@oncefuture.com>

Hi All -

I'm getting ready to push a new version of the Open Web Analytics for Wordpress plugin and was wondering if anyone felt strongly about being able to track Wordpress actions over time and/or correlate them with traffic metrics such as page views, visits, etc.

The Wordpress actions that I'm thinking of instrumenting and reporting are:

- # of comments
- # of trackbacks
- # of new posts
- # of new pages
- # of edits (posts and pages)
- # of new blogs (WP 3.0)
- # of logins
- # of new user profiles created

Am I missing something that people might find useful?

Also, does anyone know what hook is called in 3.0 when a new blog is created?

Thanks,

-P-

# of comment errors/missing fields.
I had to set the comment meta data (name, email) below the textarea to  
reduce such errors. This small change made quite a difference!

I think the new blog hook is 'wpmu_new_blog'. I think all of those
would be useful if you can related them to the stats.

Thanks. I'm glad you like it.

That's an excellent point. I noticed the @package tags but didn't think to actually use them. It should be relatively trivial to do that and I've added it to my list, but I probably won't have time to do it for a while, so if anybody wants to send a pull request on GitHub, it would be very welcome.

> Does it need much RAM to build the docs? (phpdoc itself is a memory hog so would love to use something less intensive to replace the whole of http://phpdoc.ftwr.co.uk/ )

I'm not entirely sure. Due to what I percieve as a flaw in doxygen (classes aren't associated with files from what I can tell), it does run doxygen once over all the files and then again on each individual file. It also runs GeSHi over every single function for the syntax highlighting - this could probably be improved by running GeSHi over whole files. So I think it probably does require a small excess of RAM.

And thank you to everybody else leaving positive comments. We worked hard on this tool and we're glad it's useful.

Out of interest, could you not also just skip that completely and leave
it to a client-side (Javascript) highlighter, like SyntaxHighlighter?
That would remove that completely from the server load (minus the
bandwidth for serving SyntaxHighlighter).

Server load? I think I may not have been clear. All processing including GeSHi occurs offline as a batch. What you see there is all static HTML - the search doesn't even use AJAX. So it's very easy on the server.

Ah, I see. Apologies for misinterpreting that, and thanks for clarifying. :)

Message-ID: <y2yd14758811005050208sb53386f7t944d51beb21df164@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a WP site where the index.php file resides in the webservers root
directory and the wordpress installation has been put in a subdirectory to
that called 'blog'.

The site works fine using the traditional ugly links 'index.php?page_id=n'.
When i try and convert over to using pretty permalinks all i get when I try
and access one of the pages is that "The page cannot be found". Not
Wordpress own '404' page but the webservers resonse. I'm using the WP
generated .htaccessfile below and WP 2.9.2. I couldn't find any answer to
this question on the web and the WP Codex didn't touch on the subject, why
I'm turning to you guys for help.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>

(I tried to change the RewriteBase to both 'blog/' and '/blog/' but that
didn't help either.)

Thanks!

//Christian

Hi Christian,

Do you have a index.php in the /bolg/ and root directory?

Also have you updated your settings for?

   - WordPress address (URL)
   - Site address (URL)

Check that your WordPress address has domain.com/blog since you have moved
the all the files under there.

Kind Regards,
Azizur Rahman

Hi Azizur,

Wordpress address is set to domain.com/blog and Site address is set to just
domain.com. There is a index.php in both the root directory and the blog/
directory. Pointing the webbrowser to both domain.com and
domain.com/blogyields the same result.

The site works perfectly for all intents and purposes as long as I don't use
pretty permalinks and the .htaccess file.

Message-ID: <l2y1fa535a71005050253mcf3765f5z267003dece19e275@mail.gmail.com>

The new passwords that are generated by WordPress when you go through
the "forgot your password" process are overly obscure and are
confusing for some users. An example of a password generated by
WordPress is "vRC0jaq$t^Mv".

I've now encountered three clients of mine who have not proceeded to
log in to WordPress with this password as they were confused by it or
thought that something had gone wrong. I understand that the more
obscure a password is, the harder it is to crack, however in this case
I think these overly obscure passwords are having a negative effect on
user experience. Surely a password such as "f3nDTwp2" is obscure
enough, without the added non-alpha-numeric characters?

I think the use of wp_generate_password() in the password recovery
process should be changed so that special characters are not used. It
may even be desirable to introduce another parameter to this function
so that only lowercase letters are used in this case.

Opinions?

John

Sounds like a server configuration issue to me. Check your server settings
or contact your host.

Even allowing the users to choose their own password on recovery process
would be really good.

Personally I have not had such a reaction from any of my clients, but that
seems like something that needs some attention.

Security question:

What is the difference between esc_url() and esc_attr() ?


In other words, which of the following is best?


echo '<a href="' .  esc_url($unsafe_url) . '">...

echo '<a href="' .  esc_attr($unsafe_url) . '">...

echo '<a href="' .  esc_attr(esc_url$unsafe_url)) . '">...

Hello,

I am trying to perform a query like this :
$count = $wpdb->get_var($wpdb->prepare("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s WHERE
%s = %s",$table,$idkey,$idvalue));

But it doesn't work, I have to end up doing this to have it work which
means that $type and $idfield won't be escaped before performing the
query and thus have to be verified before :
$count = $wpdb->get_var($wpdb->prepare("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM $type
WHERE $idfield = %s",$idvalue));

So my question is "simple" : is the %s, %d, %% syntax to be used only
for the values in the WHERE statments?

Several places in the core code only use esc_url. And looking through
the function, I see that it does handle single quotes. So the
preferred alternative would be:

echo "<a href='" .  esc_url($unsafe_url) . "'>";

In other words, use single quotes in the HTML, not double quotes.

A prepare like that handles the quoting for you. So your table and
field names get quoted, which naturally won't work.

In short, yes, the %s %d stuff should only be used for values. That
is, the right hand side of the = bits.

Passwords are generated using the wp_generate_password function
defined in pluggable.php. You can override it by defining your own
version somewhere, perhaps in your theme's functions.php. For example:

function wp_generate_password($length = 12, $special_chars = true) {
  return "random_password";
}

Be real careful if you redefine that function. It's used for a lot
more than just those passwords.

Setting the special_chars parameter to default to false might be a
better way to go. That would prevent the punctuation from being in the
default passwords.

esc_url alone as gives you a url that is escaped and safe for use in attributes

The important thing is to have a good secure option that is easy to use.

If the users are struggling with the current solution is it really the character set used or maybe it is more around the wording in the email or the process steps.

I don't see how reducing the character set down is going to significantly improve the user experience - most people with just copy and paste the password.

I think having it be number + letters only would be easier for people to 
remember. We can still indicate that punctuation is a good thing in our 
password strength meter.

The point of the thread was that for some users the reset password (that
would be the case for the first-time password) was something somewhat scary.
I don't really know what the solution of this would be, but I know that
after resets, people do change their passwords, so making it a little less
visually strange might be a good idea.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Magic quotes "on" forever?
Message-ID: <ff416d00-513d-4005-b029-c3bc33b8a9db@n15g2000yqf.googlegroups.com>

I am having hard times to understand how magic quotes are handled
within WP...

Whatever I do with my server php.ini, I always get quotes (even if he
tells me magic quotes are "off" when I test with the
get_magic_quotes_gpc()).

So I have been through the code and found the following from wp-
settings.php :
// If already slashed, strip.
  if ( get_magic_quotes_gpc() ) {
     $_GET    = stripslashes_deep($_GET   );
     $_POST   = stripslashes_deep($_POST  );
      $_COOKIE = stripslashes_deep($_COOKIE);
  }

  // Escape with wpdb.
  $_GET    = add_magic_quotes($_GET   );
  $_POST   = add_magic_quotes($_POST  );
  $_COOKIE = add_magic_quotes($_COOKIE);
  $_SERVER = add_magic_quotes($_SERVER);

This piece of code makes me think if I understand it well that, in the
end, quotes are applied to all datas to make things consistant accross
hosts whatever the magic quotes setting is.

Can you please confirm that my understanding is right and so based on
that, I have to stripslashes_deep again all datas (without testing the
get_magic_quotes_gpc as quotes are always applied) before manipulation
(and then obviously use the prepare before DB insertion to escape
again the quotes)?

Perhaps a productive thing to do might be to look at what kind of generated
passwords sites like Facebook, Gmail, and Twitter use and try to emulate
that.

You are basically correct, yes. For consistency, all those are magic
quoted regardless of whatever setting was used anywhere.

You can do a stripslashes_deep on the whole $_POST or whatever you
need to dequote the whole thing and every subarray in it, if you need
to do so.

That would be basically a simple 1 line patch.

In wp-login.php, in reset_password(), change this:
$new_pass = wp_generate_password();

To this:
$new_pass = wp_generate_password(12,false);

A similar change can be made in register_new_user() if you want to
affect how new user password's look.

If I were to fix one thing in that process, it would be the messages.

For example, the first e-mail now is this:

Someone has asked to reset the password for the following site and username.

http://example.com

Username: admin

To reset your password visit the following address, otherwise just
ignore this email and nothing will happen.

http://example.com/wp-login.php?blah-blah-blah

I would start by changing the above to something like:

Someone requested a new password for the following site and username.

Site: http://example.com/

Username: admin

Once you visit the following address, WordPress will generate a new
random password and e-mail it to you:

http://example.com/wp-login.php?blah-blah-blah

If you ignore this email, nothing will happen.

Cheers,

The advantage of a password containing just lowercase and uppercase letters
and numbers (without symbols), is that it is perceived as one word by the
computer/browser. Therefore a double-click selects the whole password, or
the browser's/OS's inbuilt text selection 'helps' the user select the word.
Having symbols in the word breaks both these behaviours.

Might not seem much to advanced users, but having trained many non-technical
or inexperienced clients and seen how easily they can mis-select text, I'd
say this avoids much frustration and confusion for them.

Changing this is begging for all the zealots in the twitterverse to point a
whole new set of fingers at the lack of security WordPress provides as a
default layer.

Regardless of that, is it really something that needs to be addressed to
begin with?

There is simplifying for the sake of user friendliness and then there's
dumbing down to please a small percentage of the audience. Even smaller if
you consider that a good majority of WordPress installations only ever have
one user (the admin) who if scared by a password such as the ones previously
suggested here probably have more severe concerns to deal with first.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to suggest that WordPress be elitist in
this regard, but I think Peter already mentioned that most people copy and
paste such things anyways. If they don't on your web site, Otto's suggestion
is probably the way to go.

The point of the thread was that for some users the reset password (that
would be the case for the first-time password) was something somewhat scary.
I don't really know what the solution of this would be, but I know that
after resets, people do change their passwords, so making it a little less
visually strange might be a good idea.

Doesn't it seem a little outdated to be doing this when even PHP is removing
the feature from it's core set of directives? Such security issues should be
handled inside of the database abstraction and not on a global scale, but
then I probably just don't understand the implementation due to not seeing
it from a core developers pov.

I just discovered it myself the other day while working on deep integration
of phpBB, and while it was fairly easy to work around it was still a bit of
a glassy eyed look when I found it.

You can do a stripslashes_deep on the whole $_POST or whatever you

From memory the issue is that too many plugins rely on the fact that the SuperGlobals are already escaped and don't use the more recent prepare stuff.

Therefore if we remove this we risk making all those plugins vulnerable.

What I omitted to mention was that one of my clients is actually a
WordPress.com VIP user, so improving the process on a client-by-client
basis is not something I can do for that particular site.

I think Simon makes a key point (Hi Simon!). Less experienced users
are probably already struggling through the password recovery process,
having already clicked a link in the first email and been told to now
go back and find another email and now they're presented with this
obscure password which they've either got to copy and paste or write
it down and then type it out in the password field (I've seen it
done).

Remember too that we're not only talking about admins and editors and
authors. Sites that have user registration open for whatever purpose
are potentially dealing with significantly less experienced users than
those who publish with WordPress.

Maybe it would be worth looking at the password recovery process in
general too. It works, but it's far from ideal (with the two emails
being sent).

At risk of going off-topic slightly, I don't see a reason why the
authorisation link clicked in the first email can't take you to a
screen where, instead of being presented with a message telling you
that another email has been fired off with your new password, you are

The process is actually a standard convention on the web and is presented as
such to keep people from randomly resetting passwords for accounts that
don't belong to them - if it was a single step process, I could access your
wp-login page and reset your password to my hearts content. I will never get
it for myself this way, but can you imagine the pita it would be if you got
that one jerk who thought it was funny?

That aside, the idea of presenting them with a form to choose a new password
after verifying that they are the account holder is in my opinion a really
good idea. This would completely bypass the need for dumbing down the random
password generator and add a layer of user friendly functionality that I
couldn't see anybody complaining about. +1 for that idea.

Maybe it would be worth looking at the password recovery process in
general too. It works, but it's far from ideal (with the two emails
being sent).

At risk of going off-topic slightly, I don't see a reason why the
authorisation link clicked in the first email can't take you to a
screen where, instead of being presented with a message telling you
that another email has been fired off with your new password, you are
instead presented with a screen that allows you to choose a new
password (complete with the password strength meter).

I think it would be a good idea to push everyone forward. Is there
currently any way for the plugin author to know whether the
superglobals are escaped or not? If not, why don't we add something
the authors can test for? That way (a) plugin authors get a way to
transform their plugin to a more decent style of escaping without
breaking it directly. And (b) once more and more plugins have a check
for escaped superglobals this feature can be disabled once and for
all, which is a good thing if you ask me. Escaping the superglobals
using addslashes doesn't really add much security, as there are still
SQL injection attacks possible.

One could also generate a complex password and suggest it as a good password
for those that want it fast and don't want to bother with coming up with a
new one.

In my opinion that would be ideal, as I have some clients that accept
whatever password comes their way and some are really picky and want to use
the same password everywhere. (despite my arguments as to why thats a bad
idea :))

That?s a good point.

It can be a nuissance for ?advanced users? too.  (?Argh!  Why is it
not selecting properly?  Hmm, it has symbols in it.  I?ll have to
drag-select.?)

As far as i have seen it on two projects with a medium amount (~300)
of users:
most of them don't even know standard functionality. For ex.: copy/
paste (ctrl-c/v)
is something they never heard before. So i wouldn't give too much hope
on double-klick
selection. The most problem our users had with pw-recovering mails was
the automatic-link
and the plain-text-mail: When you receive a plain-text mail in ex.
microsoft outlook, then
the recovery-link get's linked by outlook, but broken at white
spaces.
Ex: http://example.com/wp-login?action=rp&key=YcLmiYqDkXJWcDzG2mbl&login=Firstname
Lastname.
"Lastname" and the space don't get linked and the user comes to a 404-
Page.

Another thing was the confusion with "wordpress"@example.com. Our
(working) sollution
is a) using an alternate address like "registration" and b) making
descriptive login-mails
including a short faq for the most common problems. So i wouldn't
change the password.

Message-ID: <4BE2C335.5070700@gmail.com>

Hi,
I found that the theme.php locale_stylesheet() function
which is used to load the main style.css of a theme default to
media="screen".

It's a problem in some cases because if one wants to define 'print' css 
properties,
it has to add to be done in a new file to override it instead of simply 
add a @media screen {}
section in the original style.css.
I don't see many side-effects in making locale_stylesheet() defaults to 
'all'

You're welcome to create an "enhancement" ticket for that at
http://core.trac.wordpress.org.

Just a note, it has been "screen" for four years now, since that function
was introduced. I don't think we'll be breaking much, but it's definitely
something to consider.

I think that is an ideal solution too. Not 100% sure how the suggested
random password could be presented without overly confusing the screen
though. Maybe just the password strength meter on there would be
enough? Not sure.

@Mark Waterous: The password wouldn't be reset when a username is
entered into the password recovery form, so the situation of people
being able to reset your password just by entering your username
wouldn't happen. In fact nothing would happen until you click the
authorisation link in the email and then fill out a new password.

This is a bug in that case. The username should be URL encoded so it
gives you Firstname+Lastname or Firstname%20Lastname. I'll do a
ticket.

I realize that, which was the point of my explaining why it couldn't be
reduced to a single step process from the current two-step process.
Supplying a form as step two of the process instead of firing off a second
email is a good idea though.

Hey Peter, if you're searching for strings like this on a regular
basis, you should try grep. AFAIK it's native on OS X and on Windows
there's Windows Grep. Makes trawling through WordPress (and any code)
much easier.

This issue was raised (in a rather less constructive manner) on Trac
back in July http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10452 .

The general concensus (Ryan, Lloyd, Dion) was the same as what Westi
and Otto have just mentioned, that it would be great to remove the
magic quote emulation but the issues with backward compatibility are
too great. There are simply too many plugins out there that expect
escaped data that it would be asking for trouble.

Additionally, removing magic quote emulation would mean that plugins
would have to go back to checking for get_magic_quotes_gpc() (or a
similar WordPress function) and the whole reason WordPress emulates
magic quotes in the first place is to avoid this. So maybe we're stuck
with this forever?

I think more important is consistency, and that's what we've got at
the moment. Everything is magic quoted, and everyone knows this (and
if they don't they soon find out), so we're ok.

What about the possibility of adding it to an action so we can inform people
that it can be turned off and they can start learning to fend for
themselves?

It's been suggested that the current implementation is fairly easy to
circumvent and truly it is, however given the option to do it in one line
instead of hooking in and re-stripping all the super globals would seem to
suggest that people should start considering the implications of this in
their own applications. When it comes to the law, ignorance isn't an excuse,
and neither should it be when coding.

Come PHP 6 (with the current state of shared hosting, we should see full
implementation by 2032) magic_quotes_gpc() has mercifully been zapped from
the repertoire. I'd rather see WordPress push the envelope forward rather
than putting it on the backburner until everybody else has implemented the
same changes.

By domain name are you referring to the $domain parameter to that function?

If so I don't see why it can't be passed to the action as well.

I've added a few more of the function arguments to that action:

Message-ID: <C8BC2F81-5910-47D1-9D5C-CCFBA82EF515@oncefuture.com>

Folks -

I'm looking to get two hooks to fire when:

A) a user creates a _new_ post of any type
B) when a user edits a post of any type

Found that "edit_post" is perfect for case B but that the "save_post" and "wp_insert_post" hooks are problematic for A because they also fire when  "edit_post"  fires (as they should).

I was going to turn to a variable hook like "publish_post" but  since the hook name uses $post->post_type in the construction of the name I would have to setup hook ahead of time or all different post types - which isn't going to work for posts with custom types that i don't know about.

So my question is...

is there a single hook like "edit_post" that is fired ONLY when a new post of any type is created and passes the post object as or an id as a param so i can get at post's type?

Thanks,

-P-

Message-ID: <n2ra3da3fdf1005061343sfcaa3f3fpe859efcc4e14a3b8@mail.gmail.com>

I have made an abstract class "EdlWPPluginAdmin" which contains the regular
plugin admin code.

The method "AdminForm" in there is a basic admin form.

I'm trying to get add_options_page to work to call this method with:

"function AddOptionMenu() {
add_options_page($this->mStrPluginAdminPageTitle,
 $this->mStrPluginAdminMenuTitle,
$this->mStrPluginAdminAccessLevel,
 $this->mStrPluginAdminFile,
'$this->AdminForm');
}"

now... $this->AdminForm does not work.

It gives me: *Warning*: call_user_func_array() expects parameter 1 to be a
valid callback, function '$this->AdminForm' not found or invalid function
name in*C:\temp\xamp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-includes\plugin.php* on line *339*
*
*
I tried several combinations even self::, &$this->, calling it from the
class the extends the admin class and the php page that instatiantiates the
class but somehow I cant get this reference to this method to work.

I think it should be something like &$this-> but whatever i try it does not
work.

Does anyone have a clue?

It needs callbacks. Generally, that would look like 'myplugin_adminform'.
For class methods, you need to do array($this, 'adminform').

This idea is only half-formed, but could we introduce something like maybe_slash()/maybe_unslash functions so that WP itself decides when to add or remove slashes?  Get plugins using that and eventually we could phase out magic quotes.

Servus Frank,

It's contained in the "TableTools"-Plugin for "DataTables"
(http://datatables.net/plug-ins/) too. I don't use it as a standalone and
you are not really specific, what your usage is, so i guess, you just want
to know how the definitions are?

=================================
/* All just copy/paste from a theme */

/* How i register it for themes: */
$path = get_bloginfo('stylesheet_directory);
If (is_admin()) {
add_action('hook_scripts',  wp_enqueue_script( 'jquery_zero_clip_board',
$path . '/media/ZeroClipboard/ZeroClipboard.js', array('jquery') ), 32 );
}

/* Def: */
function get_admin_script_def() {
// Globale Definitionen
$path = get_bloginfo('stylesheet_directory);
$no_conflict = 'jQuery.noConflict();' . "\n";
$jquery_doc_ready_func = "\t" . 'jQuery(document).ready(function() {' .
"\n";
$jquery_end_func = "\t" .'} );' . "\n";

$table_tools_def = $jquery_doc_ready_func;
$table_tools_def .= "\t\t\t" . '"sSwfPath": "' . $path .
'/media/swf/ZeroClipboard.swf",' . "\n";
$table_tools_def .= $jquery_end_func;

$scripts = "\n";
$scripts .= "\n";
$scripts .= '<script type="text/javascript">' . "\n";
$scripts .= $table_tools_def;
$scripts .= '';
$scripts .= '</script>' . "\n";

print apply_filters('get_admin_script_def', $scripts);
}
=================================

The Problem was, that i could not change the original path that came with
the download. It's all hard-coded as far as i remember.

I know that you are some sort of wp-guru (i'm often reading your page), so i
know that i can't help you more than this. But maybe you want to take a look
at the support forum of Allan Jardin(?) who makes the DataTables-Plugin.
There are a lot of threads about TableTools and ZeroClipboard.

Best wishes,
-Kaiser.

Hi everyone,

I recently had a 2 different server get hacked. One by way of a clients
letting someone else get hold of their FTP credentials and following that
via folder permissions.

I would like to set my server up so that the FTP credentials are not
required for wordpress and plugin updates as shown here:
http://robspencer.net/auto-update-wordpress-without-ftp/

This also seems to eliminate the problem of needing to 777 the uploads
folder in order to upload images.

Is this safe to do or is it only going to cause other security problems
and/or cause problems with wordpress?

Thanks!

Ash

No - "FTP" is inherently insecure. Consider implementing ftps or sftp

I would say that making your files owned by the nobody user is not
particularly safe.

It'd be better to set your server up to use suphp or setuid on your
PHP setup, so as to make the PHP process run as the user who owns the
website files. Then as long as that user is separated from everything
else on the system, the process can't reach outside the websites own
directory.

It simply doesn't matter who ownes it because most host apache runs  
under his own user.
I think most host don't use suphp because it probably cost extra  
memory since the apache process runs for an specific user.

The goal is not to run Apache as a different user, but to run PHP as a
different user. Apache can run as whoever you want it to, that bit is
irrelevant.

> since the apache process runs for an specific user.

Any shared host not using a setuid method for executing scripts is
inherently insecure. An intrusion into the system via a shoddy script
will give the attacker the credentials of the php process (which will
be the same as that of apache), and thus read-access to all files
being served by the webserver, for all users.

Most shared hosts I've seen use a combination of Apache, FastCGI, and
suEXEC. This lets the spawned CGI process run as the owner of the file
in question. Thus, Apache can run as nobody, but the spawned php
process would run as "otto" and thus somebody breaking in would only
have otto's credentials. The only person compromised would be that one
user, not all users on the server.

There's plenty of HOWTO guides on the web as to how to set this sort
of thing up properly.

Message-ID: <z2q9aa12a491005070952h69747c5cwd7ad40d775345ca6@mail.gmail.com>

Can anyone explain a bit more deeply, what is meant in the paragraph below?
Especially in the part about "The plugin should not run arbitrary code
outside of functions"?

"The plugin should not run arbitrary code outside of functions, when
registering the uninstall hook. In order to run using the hook, the plugin
will have to be included, which means that any code laying outside of a
function will be run during the uninstall process. The plugin should not
hinder the uninstall process. "

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_uninstall_hook

There is always some code inside the plugin right? register_uninstall_hook
looks more convenient, 'cause for example I use variable in option and table
names, which depend on the classname of the plugin, or for example I want to
use variables form within my plugin to check some conditions before
uninstalling. And by the way can I use array($this, 'callback') type of
callback in register_uninstall_hook?

Basically, Your plugin shouldnt run any PHP upon inclusion OTHER THAN
add_action/add_Filter()

<?php
/* header..*/

add_action('....
register_uninstall_hook...
?>

Is Good.

This is bad:
 <?php
/* header..*/

if ( strpos(.....) )
  wp_redirect(....
if ( something )
  include somethingelse.php

add_action('....
register_uninstall_hook...
?>

And no, You cannot use array(&$this in uninstall hooks, the uninstall hook
is stored within the database, its not determined at run time. Your plugin
will not recieve init/plugins_loaded/admin_init, etc hook firings when the
uninstall hook is called, Its a pure "Heres some SELF CONTAINED code to run
to clean up"

Actually, you can, but it causes an extra SQL query on each page load.

Also, you can only use _one_ hook with register_uninstall_hook.

Arbitrary code is referring to code that is not wrapped inside a function,
with the exception of course of add_action and add_filter calls (and
_ref_array) tying those functions to hooks. (And hook registrations for
activation, deactivation, uninstall, etc.)

Generally speaking, a plugin should never do anything before the init hook.
That includes the enqueue of scripts and styles, the registration of custom
post types and taxonomies, and so much else.

Since the plugin file needs to be included to execute the uninstall
function, that code would run here. You don't want that.

As Dion said, you cannot use a class method for a callback for an uninstall
hook. You also cannot use multiple uninstall callbacks. If you need a more
complex uninstall process, use uninstall.php. Make sure you check for
defined( 'WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN' ) before continuing (die if it is not
defined) when using the uninstall.php file.

Like the uninstall.php to uninstall, can we use install.php or
activation.php for activation process?

No. Those are much more flexible, as they are run either after activation or
just
before deactivation. They can be class methods, what have you. Uninstall is
simply
an exception, and so in 2.7 uninstall.php was introduced so uninstall
scripts can be
isolated and more robust.

Not one bit. Use uninstall.php if you want flexibility, or
register_uninstall_hook if you
want simplicity. Bottom line is, we're executing code when a plugin is not
active, so we
need to be nimble about it.

Unfortunately I can't use uninstall.php for my purpose. Or better to say it
would be kinda last resort.

I read the code now and understand what you mean... But, I still find it
pretty weird. Isn't it? Why would you need to store callback in the
database? Or why would you need to call it directly? Why not just to do
do_action('uninstall_' . $file ... and let the user to hook on this and do
whatever he/she finds appropriate? This could eliminate neccessity of using
function_name callback only, and could have been much more cleaner, logical
and convenient in general.

Ok, whatever is the reason behind such solution I don't get, but even if
there's one, I've found very nice workaround, which could work if only
WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN would have been defined for register_uninstall_hook
version too. Is there any reason why it's not?

When you plugin goes through the uninstall process, it isn't going to be
activated by that point. In most cases, it would have been deactivated well
before that page load, which means none of its code is included. Thus,
WordPress uses the option stored in the table to determine what file to
include and what code to execute. Hence why it must work this way, with a
function or a static class method. The rest of the plugin simply will not be
loaded.

WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN is only designed for uninstall.php, that way that file
is not unintentionally included or hit with an HTTP request and the
uninstall procedure is run. It's no different from dying at the top of
certain files (such as edit-form-advanced.php) if ABSPATH is not defined.

Hence, you can use uninstall.php, the same way you can use the uninstall
hook, in most cases. In both cases, the PHP code you are running may be
blissfully unaware of anything else your plugin normally does on
initialization.

Ok, I understand now what you are doing, but it doesn't answer question -
why.

> In both cases, the PHP code you are running may be
> blissfully unaware of anything else your plugin normally does on
> initialization.

I'd like it to be aware at some extent.

Ok, I will tell you what my workaround was. Since register_uninstall_hook
does include my plugin main file I can execute some code and obviously do
add_action('uninstall_' . plugin_basename(__FILE_), array($this,
'on_unistall'), 0); too, right? If I knew prior to that that it is uninstall
procedure going on I could break execution here (having initialized whatever
I would need later when action will be called) and wait for an action. Then
I could remove default action (my action has higher priority) and do
whatever I need. WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN could have helped here a lot.

Do you find any issue with my solution?

The only thing is that I need to know that uninstall is happening and not
just some regular load.

So far I've found only one way to do this - check for: $_POST['action'] ==
'delete-selected'  &&   $_POST['verify-delete'] == 1            &&
in_array(plugin_basename(__FILE__), (array)$_POST['check']).

Only that it seems wholly unnecessary.

What exactly is the issue here? Your plugin shouldn't do anything of
consequence merely from being included. Quite honestly, NO plugin
should do anything of consequence from merely being included.

Take your "on load" stuff and move it inside a function that's hooked
to plugins_loaded instead, so it'll run that stuff after the normal
load process. plugins_loaded doesn't get triggered on the uninstall,
so you'll be safe there.

I completely agree with Otto. I'm not at all sure what you're trying to do,
but I'm sure you can do it without reinventing the wheel 10 times over.

This is honestly why plugins break on new versions of WP -- it's often not
that they do something that the API doesn't provide for, it's that they do
something the API *does *provide for, but *don't* use the API, and that's
what breaks.

You don't need WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN to check if you're being uninstalled.
When your uninstall hook is fired, you'll know you're being uninstalled.
Clean up your data so WP can delete you.

Could cause security problems. Setting write to permission like that 
(777 means any user can write to it) leaves the door wide open, 
particularly on shared hosts. I cannot even count how many hacked WP 
sites I've fixed that were hacked only because someone broke into some 
other site on the server, then ran a script that went bonkers looking at 
every dir in the tree for anything it could write to, and the installed 
backdoors, malware, unwanted downloadable files, and so on.

Ideally, handle WP updates *manually* via SFTP or FTPS or SCP and don't 
give the login out to anybody that cannot absolutely trusted. And 
anytime you have a change in personnel (contract or hired) change the 
psws immediately, if not before someone leaves (assuming you know 
they're gonna be let go).

Message-ID: <x2l2d224cb11005071853vef355633wd7256bef84597147@mail.gmail.com>

"The plugin should not run arbitrary code outside of functions, when
registering the uninstall hook. In order to run using the hook, the plugin
will have to be included, which means that any code laying outside of a
function will be run during the uninstall process. The plugin should not
hinder the uninstall process."

*Explanation*:

I'm not sure what the confusion is of this and from what Dion stated. I'm
basically going to restate what he had said earlier. However a little
history.

*History*:

When the hook is used, the plugin is deactivated. In fact, in 2.7 and I will
assume in later versions, the plugin has to be deactivated to be
uninstalled. Therefore, if you are running code outside of functions, then
this will run when the plugin is uninstalled. Most of the time, the code
won't affect anything and should be "safe" however, during the development
of the solution, a lot of compromise and elitism went into the patch.

Really, I had no idea nor I believe anyone else had the best way to do it.
The hook seemed like it would be "best" and the file based alternative was
added later to satisfy some base concerns either I had or other people or
both. It has been a long time since that patch was applied and I'm not going
to read through what other people and I wrote. Not all of which is on that
ticket [1].

*Back to Explanation*:

Simply, the point of the statement is to let you know that you should
*never* run code outside of functions and class methods. During that time, I
noticed that a few plugins were including code that was run in the "global"
scope and thus was causing problems when the "global" scoped switched to
"function" or local scope. Since the uninstall hook is function / local
scope, any "global" scope code will need to be defined as thus:

10. global $my_global_variable;
20. if( conditional() ) {
30.     $my_global_variable = 'womething';
40. } else {
50.    $my_global_variable = 'widget';
60. }

function uninstallhook() {
   global $my_global_variable;
}

The problem is that unless 10 is in the code, the uninstallhook won't
function properly and it was a fear that people would incorrect assume that
the fault was WordPress when it was in fact the crappy [2], poorly coded
plugin's fault.

*Conclusion*:

So basically the comment, and I guess it was a little vague, is just to say
that if you do the above that it is up to you to ensure that your code works
when in function / local scope when the uninstall hook is called. The second
point is that you shouldn't be running anything other than the uninstall
hook anyway. If everything is in functions, then this will be fine since
only the uninstall hook function and its helpers will run.

The second point also includes security. Basically, your code is being
deleted and the reason for the uninstall process in the first place. To
allow for you clean up any tables, metadata, files, etc that you created
during the plugins run and activation. That is it. It does not allow for any
special cases and if that is what you are asking, like, "Well, I want a
screen where they are asked if they want to keep their data." Then guess
want, that has already been debated and while it can be brought up again for
a future patch it was decided that it just wasn't going to happen by the
powers that be. I, alas, do not know if that is already possible since it
has been a year since I looked at any improvements.

I do think that the uninstall.php is the best method for uninstalling, since
it gives you full access to the WordPress library (admin + core) and is, in
my opinion, cleaner when writing than using a function which will most often
be mixed in with a lot of other misc functions. Please note that the define
is only defined for the file (unless this was corrected, I'm going off the
original implementation) and not for the hook, so it should only be checked
for the file in uninstall.php and not the uninstall hook.


[1] I don't know WTF that ticket is, it appears some "improvements" / fixes
that require additional fixes went into a relatively simple process. It
isn't the ticket I'm references earlier and hopefully won't be confused with
the initial uninstall patch and ticket. I'm unsure why two functions are
even required during the uninstall hook process. The primary hook should be
calling other functions that run processes for uninstalling instead of
cycling through a series of functions. This seems like a bug with the
plugin's code than a bug in WordPress codebase, unless it allows it, then it
should only allow one function regardless.

[2] I'm not sure, but I mean the other more obscene curse word, but I'm not
sure if that is "cool" so I'm going to play it safe... well, safer than just
not including it.

I think the confusion really just stems from the lack of defined purpose 
of the uninstall process.

The uninstall process is to clean up data that would otherwise be left 
behind when the plugin is deleted. I'm not sure it could be said any 
more clearly than that.

I was confused the first time I read this. I think I understand a bit 
more. I your case, you should probably have a method in your class that 
runs some uninstall processing for each of the classes that has options. 
However, I will suggest that a better idea is to just, well I mean the 
class names are known, so why not just reference the class names from 
within the uninstall process for the options instead of the first 
suggestion?

As for the second problem, while array($this, 'callback') won't work, 
array('Class_Name', 'callback') will. You will just have to reference 
everything in that code statically or as a function. So technically, you 
can use a class method, but it will have to be static.

>  solution?


Not at all, it is a very simplified solution for something that can be 
extremely difficult to implement otherwise.

 > "The plugin should not run arbitrary code outside of functions"

If you are wondering whether the statement is saying that you should not 
use classes when using the uninstall process then the answer is no. Let 
me be more clear since it was answered in what might be a double 
negative. You may use either classes or functions in your code and the 
statement was in no way suggesting that you MUST use functions over 
classes. It was an example and if I had to write functions or classes 
everywhere I would probably kill myself with the strain of having to 
figure that into the correct context of each sentence it applies. It is 
simply best practice to not use a class static method for the uninstall 
hook, since I mean, it would be basically a function that is namespaced 
in a class instead of a real namespace.

I already stated what the arbitrary code means in the last email and 
won't restate what is in there. If you must, please read what Dion wrote 
again a second or third time and it should be more clear what is really 
meant for those two words. I believe Dion was instrumental in the 
creation of the initial patch and additional fixes that came after, so I 
trust Dion would fully know and understand the purpose and discussion 
that went into the patch and additional improvements / fixes. I'm simply 
trying to confirm and attempt to further the understanding of what the 
uninstall hook and file mean and their purpose.

I believe Nacin and Otto explained some of your problems and will 
suggest reading those responses again if further confused. You should be 
using the WordPress API and any attempt to bypass will simply fail. The 
uninstall process checks for the file or the hook existence before it 
will even attempt the uninstall process. If those do not exist, then it 
simply will not run.

>  just some regular load.


The reason the WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN constant is only available for the 
file is that it is not needed for the function. The constant is for 
security so that the uninstall process is not run by accident. You could 
get around it by checking ABSPATH as well, but it is better to check for 
the constant to be sure that the plugin is meant to be uninstalled. For 
the hook, it is assumed that the plugin is meant to be uninstalled.

Please refrain from over thinking the process. You appear to think that 
you have to make it harder than it needs to be. If uninstall.php is 
included, it will be in function / local scope and after checking for 
the WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN constant you can assume that it is meant to 
uninstall the plugin. If the hook is called, then you can assume that 
the plugin is meant to be uninstalled. You do not need to do any more 
checks to be sure that the code was meant to be uninstalled.


I do not think more focus needs to be paid for this topic, but I believe 
it could be improved by adding additional information based on what was 
discussed here to the codex page and to the inline documentation in 
WordPress to prevent future confusion as this one. I did not think that 
people wouldn't be able to comprehend what was stated in the comment and 
I wanted to be as brief as possible to be sure that people read the 
comment. It appears I was wrong in this instance and I'm sorry that you 
were confused. I do not plan on implementing my suggestion, so I hope it 
was fully explained to you.

I'm not really sure what you're asking. But as far as CSS selectors
go, you can select for list using an identifier and then select the
sublists using a class. So you can have something like this

<ul id="mainlist">
<li>Root1
<ul class="sublist">
<li>Sublist item </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Root2
<ul class="sublist">
<li>Sublist item </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Then use the #maillist and .sublist for the styling in your CSS

Cheers,
Gaurav

Thank you guys for your responses. I will consider how I can modify my code
with plugins_loaded, which Otto suggested.

My code does something in constructor apart from defining actions, I guess
that's what is understood under 'arbitrary code' in codex. So I really need
a conditional to break it at some point.

> I your case, you should probably have a method in your class that runs
some uninstall processing for each of the classes that

options instead of the first suggestion?

I've got options and tables defined that depend on the name of the class -
they use it as namespace, so doing it in API way could be problematic. I
won't know what the prefixes are if I not instantiate my plugin class and it
looks like I can't do that easily with an API.

Ok, what I do is I have my small framework, from which I inherit my all new
plugins. My friends are using it too, so I needed a simple, transparent way
to clean up after plugin, when it gets uninstalled. Of course I could tell
guys to do a particular things in uninstall.php, but big part of logic is
encapsulated in parent class, so they will need to look in there and check
what the names and namespaces are and come up with static names, which they
will need to use in uninstall.php. It's not that hard of course, but I
rather automate this somehow. Of course I probably could include my plugin
from uninstall.php and do some cleaning from there, but among other things
it adds complexity and clutters plugin directory too. At least I will have
to explain to everyone - guys you do not need to touch that uninstall.php in
root directory or something. Then if I could have just a regular class
method that does uninstall it just could have been so much more logical - I
think that's what people expect anyway.

Description in Codex is a bit not clear, the one for uninstall.php - is, but
for register_uninstall_hook - is not. It is as if it is not needed at all,
and is there just in case and at some point will become depricated. What it
actually does, becomes clear only after you read actual code in the core.
I'm sure everyone thinks - why it doesn't work like any other hooks? (I know
why it doesn't - no need to explain once again :)

But anyway, I think my solution is pretty clean by now, I still use an API
right? It won't harm anyone if I remove default action and run my own? If I
could get rid of ugly: $_POST['action'] == 'delete-selected'  &&
$_POST['verify-delete'] == 1            &&
in_array(plugin_basename(__FILE__), (array)$_POST['check']) it could become
even cleaner I think.

Thank you guys. I still think that register_uninstall_hook approach needs
some rethinking.

That's my use-case exactly.

Try this:

// Have more than one callback attached to the uninstall hook
function add_uninstall_hook($plugin, $callback) {
	// trigger $is_uninstallable_plugin flag
	register_uninstall_hook($plugin, '__return_false');

	add_action('uninstall_' . plugin_basename($plugin), $callback);
}


You use it exactly like register_activation_hook().

Looks very nice. But I don't quite understand how this may work... ? It
won't work with 2.9.2, right? Is it something from next version? What is
going to change?

That was vast :)  Flash-back into the history behind such solution was great
too :)

But I think it's confusing for everyone, who is trying to use it without
reading the core. In my opinion it means that it needs some improvement,
register_uninstall_hook part, I mean.

Why not hook into the uninstall hook?
I mean:

function my_plugin_main_uninstall(){
$args_init = array( 'foo' => 'bar' , 'bar' => 'foo' );
$args_init = apply_filter( 'my_plugin_args_init' , $args_init );
if( $args_init['include'] ) include
do_action( 'my_namespaced_uninstall_init' , $args_init );
if( $args_init['foo'] ) do_action( 'my_plugin_foo_uninstall' );
if( $args_init['bar'] ) do_action( 'my_plugin_bar_uninstall' );
};
register_uninstall_hook( $my_file , 'my_plugin_main_uninstall' );


Maybe I'm missing something, but by what I have understood, all you need 
is to declare a gazillion things. By creating your uninstall hooks, you 
can add the declaration functions both to plugins_loaded/admin/whatever 
AND my_unique_namespaced_uninstall_init.
I've been working with a "framework plugin", too, and this approach of 
uninstalling looks easier to me than all the uninstall.php & other 
approaches. I've got some dependencies that may be, or may be not, used 
by some of the "child plugins". There are options that may need removal, 
and maybe not because they simply don't exist ? so it's better to skip 
that part of the uninstall process, instead of just checking every time 
if there is anything that needs removal. Besides, some plugins using 
shared optional components may have contradictory uninstall options ? 
some parsing is needed here. This way I can do anything I need, in the 
right order, without having to duplicate selection code in each of the 
child plugins (which could even break older child plugins).

It will work with 2.9.2 as long as you also add this:

// WP < 3.0
if ( ! function_exists('__return_false') ) :
function __return_false() {
    return false;
}
endif;

Ah, I see now :) Very clean indeed, I think it should go into the core.
Along with WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN both for uninstall.php and
register_uninstall_hook. It won't harm to have a solid way to check what's
happening.

That is exactly what I meant by plugins trying to avoid the existing API end
up breaking. When that stops working in a future version, don't say I didn't
tell you so:

 This is honestly why plugins break on new versions of WP -- it's often not

Well, thanks :) Although I think that's the case when an API is faulty and
needs some improvement. Is it so hard to remove WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN
definition from conditional?

It isn't, but it wasn't the point of the constant. The point was to provide
a safeguard for uninstall.php, not to allow the same callback to be used for
both an uninstall routine and something else.

You're welcome to open a ticket for it for > 3.0.

I'm not going to use it for something else. I described my problem above. It
is that I use variables in options and table names, and it would be a
duplicate work to redefine the whole logic in uninstall.php. I just do not
see a point why I shouldn't be able to use the logic I already have (and use
OOP approach and not that ugly function namespacing). And then there is some
support built-in already, like calling callback with an action instead of
calling it in some other way. Why not to make this support more conssistent
and convenient.

I don't think anyone knows specifics of what you need. What you describe 
seems to be that your plugin is full of WTFs and nightmare-ish, but I'm 
most likely wrong. You probably have an awesome system that eases the 
development of plugins a great deal. This one thing is hindering you 
since it does not fit nicely in to the way you developed the plugin and 
wish to implement something that is external and don't really know how 
to quickly and easily do so without refactoring either your code or the 
WordPress code. I judge, it is one of my flaws and it is compounded by 
being wrong a lot.

The truth is, I have not seen your code, nor do I quite frankly care to 
see your code. Dion might or Andrew or anyone else that might have 
replied. If it would help you, then I'm sure someone in the community 
would step up and do so. However, speaking only for myself, I do not 
believe a patch is warranted for your specific use case.

Honestly, probably the best "fix" would be to remove the requirement 
that the callback is added and add just the file to the database 
instead. It would then be up to the plugin to set the hooks that are run 
for the uninstall. This would hopefully, solve your problem and would 
solve scribu problem as well. I'm not quite sure why it is even there in 
the first place other than redundancy to ensure that the uninstall hook 
is called and to correct any other cases where the hooks would not be 
set when the file is included, if the developer was expecting hooks to 
be called. If that was the case, then it was just being lazy and not 
wanting to test any use cases that wouldn't work without the redundancy. 
It is something that could be removed once full testing is done.

Well, I do remember that with development, WordPress shouldn't hinder 
the methodology of the plugin, even if, technically, the plugin 
developer is wrong. The above solution wouldn't be difficult and my 
estimate would be that it would take 10 minutes. However, testing it 
would take about an hour or so and I'm not up for that. Have fun!

Just FYI, classes can still be used, the method would just be static. I 
have stated this before, but I might not have been clear. Also, there is 
nothing wrong with using functions. The uninstall process is best 
separated from the rest of the plugin code, which is why most system 
programs have an separate application that uninstalls the main program.

Jacob, guys, I think you overcomplicate things. scribus solution  (above) is
very simple and clean, it doesn't add any load. My solution is very similar
to his, but I just remove default hook and use my own. The only thing I was
wondering about, was whether there is any reason why WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN
couldn't be defined for both uninstall approaches.

In fact, I think storing callback in database is much more nightmerish, then
whatever I or scribu have suggested.

For the record: The only truly safe wordpress install is one where the only
directories that apache can write to (regardless of whether its through
chmoding loose enough or giving apache direct access via chown) are the ones
that ABSOLUTELY MUST be writeable, i.e. */wp-content/uploads/, *and those
directories can't run any scripts. Any folder that is writeable by the
server should be *unable to process any scripts especially php.* You can
achieve this in your apache config using come arcane definitions about php.
Here's how I do it on a site to get you started, I don't fully understand it
all any more:

    <Directory /path/to/site/wp-content/uploads>
        AllowOverride None
        php_admin_flag engine off
        php_admin_value open_basedir none
    </Directory>

You may not require absolute security but without these setups then there is
always a chance that someone could upload a exploit file using a hacked user
account then access it in the wp-config/uploads/ directory using their
browser. You need to make those directories inert for scripts, which
shouldn't be a problem as I don't think anyone expects PHP to be uploaded to
posts for any reason.

I thought the only truly safe WordPress install was one on a computer not connected to any network, ever. ;-)

But seriously, do you know if this Apache config items will work in .htaccess, or only httpd.conf?

Message-ID: <174c6ebb-d859-4ee9-b6f6-78ea9d2763d3@e1g2000yqe.googlegroups.com>

Hello,

I am hooking on the wp_mail_from and the wp_mail_from_name on one of
my plugins to modify the source email address and the from name field.

I have checked the wp_mail function and looks like it assumes that the
filtered values are valid (unless I am wrong, I don't see any sort of
sanity check on the values returned by the filters which is fine as it
could be seen as a security enforcement). I am not sure if the fact
that the parsing to separate the fields (from, cc, subject, etc...)
has already been performed is enough to guarantee security.

I'd like to understand what kind of checks I could add in my filtering
functions to ensure that no mail header injection is performed. I have
used the is_email function for the email @. What about the from_name?
I am usually putting in it the user meta first and last name. If I
escape these using the esc_attr or esc_html, it doesn't sound very
appropriate as entities are converted and thus display is a mess. What
the about the \r\n risk?

For the mail content, as by default, it is set as plain text and not
html, there is no worry about it as far as I understood, right?

Thanks!

Hi All,

Not sure if you've had the same experience as me but lately when I google for a technical problem related to development it seems I keep finding links to StackOverflow[1] and those links seem to best address the reason I googled.

Turns out the team that created StackOverflow just got $6 million in VC from a dream-team of investors[2] and are now accepting proposals[3] for specific communities.  Because their site does such an incredible job of surfacing the correct and relevant answers I'd love to see a Stack Overflow-like site for WordPress.  

Turns out they require a significant number of people to sign on for supporting a proposed topic in order for them to be willing to launch a site([3]: Find the heading "The New Stack Exchange Site Creation Process.") I'm hoping others here agree that Stack Overflow has been useful and would like to see one for WordPress too.

BTW, all content on their sites is CC licensed and available for download so Automattic could choose to repurpose the content on WordPress.org or WordPress.com. Hopefully the fact it's not part of http://wordpress.* won't keep those at Automattic from supporting this proposal.

I would wait until GSoC ends, afaik Barry Carlyon will be working on
something like that for WordPress.org forums and I'm sure he can make
something better or at leas as good as SO is.

Plus, there are a couple of SO open source clones (including one in php,
cakephp if I'm not wrong).

I hear you. But I think it highly unlikely that a college intern over a summer project could generate the results that the experienced team (lead by Joel Spolsky of Joel on Software) who has been working on this for 2 years and now has $6 million in VC can produce. 

Besides, Barry is doing "WP as bug tracker" not "WP as an answers exchange."  Bugs are but a small subset of things people need answers for.

Have you seen the traffic StackOverflow has gotten?   7.1 million unique people per month per Quantcast [1].  I don't know of any open source community using an SO clone that has even come within an order of magnitude, do you?

Since their stated corporate goal is "Make the Internet a better place to get expert answers to your questions"[2] and they've proven they can get really high traffic (StackOverflow is #709 on Quantcast) then it would seem it would really help WordPress if more people could find the answers they need more quickly and easily. And since they pay for the hosting and the data is Creative Commons and can be exported then it seems there's more downside to waiting then there is to moving forward?

StackOverflow platform is very good, much better then any other Q&A
platforms I've seen. I use it regularly.

1,853 questions. So maybe I'm not understanding your question  
correctly, but WP is already very well served on StackOverflow. What  
more do you want to see? Why would they approve a StackExchange site  
for WP when it's already well covered by SO? Isn't SE for NON- 
programming sites that aren't already covered on SO?

I think the idea of StackExchange is explicitly for non-programming  
topics, like photography, or advanced mathematics, or law...

Hi Scot,

Good question. And not one I can answer conclusively since I'm not them. So I've emailed them to ask them to weigh in.

>  What more do you want to see? 

Another good question.  In part it's what I don't want to see that's more important.  I don't want to see[1] anything about  ASP.NET, C#, Java, Ruby-on-Rails, C, ASP.NET MVC, WPF, Objective-C, C++, Ruby, Visual Studio, and more.

And when I look at those tagged best practices[2], for example, I want them to be all about WordPress and not all about programming in general.  

Really, its the same reason anyone creates a niche business/forum/community/product when one that serves the needs somewhat already exists; to better serve the needs of the niche.

Also when I look at the user list[3] I see lots of people who've answered lots of questions, but I can't see the rating for people who are focused on WordPress.  Even if you could filter by those with WordPress skills, one person may answer a thousand questions with only one on WordPress and another may answer 100 WordPress questions. In the context of WordPress I don't care about the first guy but do care about the second (and my bet is that guy would be otto, or maybe scribu.)

> I think the idea of StackExchange is explicitly for non-programming topics, like photography, or advanced mathematics, or law...

Looking at their process and FAQ[4] is appeared to me the only thing that was relevant to them was "Is there enough of a community to make it success?"  Again, that's my read on it and not their perspective.

But I would argue that WordPress is far broader than programmers. Of those people interested in WordPress I'd say that less than 1% of them are programmers; if more than that surely less than 10%. In addition there are also graphic designers, consultants, agencies, and people who managing hosting. There are also bloggers who've set up their own site and companies now using WordPress as a CMS. And there are end users who are using WordPress because someone else made it available for them to do their job.  My bet is that most of those people will either be intimidated by all the other programming talk on StackExchange and/or feel like it doesn't meet their needs.

That's my view anyway and why I thought it would be great for the WordPress community at large to have it's own specific StackExchange.

-Mike
P.S. Your email gave me a great idea. They could take all the questions on [5] and redirect them to the new WordPress specific exchange. What a great way to kickstart the content!  As a matter of fact I expect they will need to do exactly this many times over time as niches are identified in large communities; they can be spun off into new sites with content ready-to-go.

Great comment. But you are off a bit on the analogy which I only bring up so that people don't misunderstand StackExchange and how it relates to this proposal.  

Wikia allows anyone to create a Wiki who wants to, and there can be as many wikis on the same topic as people want to create.  Wikia is like Ning used to be and Facebook and LinkedIn still are in that regard.

StackExchange however takes proposals and only accepts them when there is enough demand to create a vibrant community. Further, SE won't create more than one exchange on a selected topic; i.e. they won't create a wp-exchange.org and a wp-answers.org.  Much like the Highlander, there can be only one. :)

Message-ID: <x2u70d23f011005101033x802df424sbffabc5723ddb70d@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on an artists website where I have categories set up like this:

Paintings
   -collection1
   -collection2

Prints
   -collection3
   -collection4

Once I have the category I want to loop through all posts in that category
to grab a custom field from each post.

my url string looks like this:

http://www.mysite.com/paintings/collection1/post-name
http://www.mysite.com/prints/collection3/post-name

I'm trying to get the categories using this:

$categories = get_the_category($post->ID);
echo $categories[0]->cat_name;

It gets the parent category (category[0]) without any problem however it
isn't getting child categories at all.

What am I doing wrong?

thanks
brian

Firstly, the category in the URL string is irrelevant. You'll find
that a URL of http://www.mysite.com/paintings/bippyboppity/post-name
will work just as well.

Secondly, get_the_category will get the categories assigned to the
post itself. But while categories are indeed hierarchical, the
hierarchy only applies to the categories themselves, not to the posts
in those categories.

That is, if you have parent->child categories, and you put a post into
child, then it is NOT also in parent. Categories are like tags, if you
want a post to be in a category, you must explicitly put it in that
category. It doesn't inherit any hierarchy from the category tree.

You're asking for trouble using categories in your URLs. It shouldn't affect
the issue you mention below, but I recommend against this pattern if there
is any way you can avoid it. WP is not well designed for for category based
post urls compred to dates.

Have you considered using "Pages" instead of posts? It looks like that would
be a logical way to organize your collections of paintings and prints and by
making them children you'd get your desired URL structure.

That looks like it should work. Did you try print_r($categories) to see
what's inside?

Got to this conversation late but this is so obviously a situation where a
few small changes can make a big difference.

+1 for choosing a password after clicking the first email link rather than
causing another email to be sent and checked. The current system has always
seemed ridiculous to me and is very very annoying at a time when you are
already probably feeling annoyed. This feels like a long-term plan though
since it involves a change to UI etc.

+1000 to simplifying the default generated passwords. There is pretty much
no reason at all why normal people would use the ^ symbol in daily life. It
is only on the 6 because of a historical coincidence IMHO. People don't know
what to do with them and the click-to-select thing has bitten me every
single time I've used an auto-generated password. If nothing else the
current insane passwords feel like something that a web app might choke on,
even to someone that understands web apps and how finicky they can be.

The added 'security' is not worth the loss in usability, especially
considering the fact that making the passwords weaker but still strong will
increase the likelihood that users keep the generated password instead of
immediately changing it back to 'mypass'.

I couldn't find a mention of this on trac so I created a ticket:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13324

Hey guys, THIS list is for WP hackers - e.g. not for people who want to
further fragment and then reconsolidate the WP community to their own
advantage. That said, WTH does StackExchchange have to do with hacking
WP ?????????????  Nothing.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Twitter API and Authentication
Message-ID: <AANLkTinBWFLaGv142GGeKhhRtUDv7_TSN-PNGExXxSud@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Hackers,

Some of you may already know me through WordCamps, Barcamps and various
conferences but for those of you who don't, my name is Matt Harris and I've
just joined Twitter as a Developer Advocate.

I'm emailing this list to reach those of you who either write plugins that
use Twitter, or develop websites for which a Twitter widget is used.

On the 30th June the Twitter REST API will stop supporting Basic
Authentication and instead switch to OAuth. This means
* all user authenticated requests to the API must be OAuth signed,
preferably using OAuth headers.
* calls not requiring authentication should ensure they do not send auth
headers of any kind as doing so will return an error
* basic auth will cease to function on the REST API
* the streaming API will still support basic auth but this is likely to
change later in the year
* the search API does not require auth so is not part of this project
* the public RSS/ATOM feeds do not require auth so are not part of this
project

So, if you have WordPress sites that publish to Twitter please check they
are using OAuth and not Basic Authentication.
If you are a plugin developer, please update your plugin to use OAuth and
remove and Basic Authentication code.
If you're plugin just consumes RSS/Atom feeds from Twitter you will be
unaffected by this change.

Information about OAuth and community code libraries can be found on
http://dev.twitter.com or, if you have any questions please ask in the Twitter
development talk Google group:
http://groups.google.<http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk>
com/group/twitter-development-<http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk>
talk <http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk>. You can also
find me on Twitter as @themattharris or at various events including Google
IO later this month.

Best,
Matt Harris

So here's what Robert Cartaino from StackExchange replied to me in email, copied with permission:

Ideas presented in meta.SE aren't official site proposals (the topic proposal site should start going online in the next few weeks). They're more of a dry run to see if there is any interest in the subject... which it appears there is.

People who propose, say, an SQL site, when there is Stack Overflow. Or, in your case, a Wordpress-specific site that may be, at least partially, covered by other sites. I'll have to get those questions answered before I can reach out to something like wp-hackers and offer specific direction or advice.

Yes, I agree fragmentation is a concern. I guess my bigger concern is that the current forums available, while fragmented, do a collectively poor job of surfacing answers to common questions without people having to constantly ask them again and finding the right people to answer them.  To me solving the latter would be worth more of the former.

> ...then reconsolidate the WP community to their own advantage.

Since StackExchange didn't approach WordPress but instead I proposed it I can't see that that criticism fairly applies to SE.  And I have no idea how it can benefit me any more than anyone else who needs good and quick answers to WP-related questions.  Are you seeing something nefarious I'm not?

> That said, WTH does StackExchchange have to do with hacking
> WP ?????????????  Nothing.

That's your opinion and you are entitled to it. My opinion is that the questions that get asked repeatedly on wp-hackers and on wordpress.org could be answered on a WordPress StackExchange and the good answers would bubble up to the top for easy google-picking so that people wouldn't have to bother people with repeated questions nor would they need to dig so hard for answers.  And the bonus is it could serve more than just hackers; it could help designers, hosters, and users too.

That said, if you can suggest of a more appropriate venue than this list to ask about interest in a WordPress StackExchange I'll gladly take the question elsewhere and apologize for listing it here.

Is there a reason we'd put any official Q&A on some other service 
instead improving our own resources at WordPress.org? Why not put our 
energies into improving our own site and support services?

I wasn't assuming it would be "official", just a site that is available as this is now:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wordpress

> Why not put our energies into improving our own site and support services?

Because one entity can't do everything optimally?  

SE has a proven platform that is working to provide high quality answers to >7 million uniques per month. It would take WordPress.org at least a 6 months if not more realistically 18 months before having a platform that works that well, if ever.  And since the content will be licensed with Creative Commons if you do get around to building such a platform then just pull in their content and proactively route new users to your answers exchange. But in the mean time you'd actually get a better platform for supporting WordPress users. After all it's about supporting users not about protecting turf, right?

I saw the amount ($6 million) and who invested in SE and read about their changed strategy and I came to believe that SE will be very significant over the next several years. Then I realized StackOverflow had become my preferred post-google search destination for programming answers and I thought it would be great to have the same for all of WordPress.  I felt it would be better to get a strong SE for WordPress before Drupal and Joomla get a chance to do the same (since I'd rather more people use WP than those others.) 

If you feel otherwise then fine just ignore my proposal, maybe it'll go away.  I've already generated enough traffic on this list for this topic thus far today.

If you haven't used stackoverflow it is an extremely well designed site 
- good answers and questions) find their way to the top. It encourages 
people to ask clear and concise questions (the question can be rated up 
as well as answers). The style and structure is much, much, much better 
than standard forums. Just as an example as you are typing in your 
question it automatically retrieves a list of similar questions to 
reduce duplicates. Certainly if it was forums (or a mailing list...) vs. 
a stackexchange site I would choose the stackexchange site in a second.

And of course the domain is chosen by the community in question - I 
don't see why it wouldn't be able to go on a subdomain of wordpress.org 
with the current styles applied to it.

 >Why not put our energies into improving our own site and support

They're offering a really great service for free - I would make contact 
with them and see what they say about putting one on wordpress.org as 
the "official" wordpress stackexchange site.

I don't know why I'm replying, but I think I have a really good quote:

"...Because NIH (Not Invented Here) has no business in an open source 
community where the foundation of such a product would have to be open 
and supported by people who might be fragmented away from other tasks."

Leveraging great products where the community may easily join and 
participate verses spending years or more, for example the time between 
the closure of the WordPress theme gallery to it opening again and the 
sort of mess that caused. I do agree that the newer theme gallery is 
fantastic, but it probably would have been better if it was more, I 
don't know, open? Maybe. Not sure.

Of course, you work for a company that supports and maintains the 
platform, so I guess it is a gray area. On one hand the company would 
have to hire someone to spend a great deal of time on a product that has 
no real benefit towards the company [1]. I do think it is great that 
Automattic is supporting BuddyPress and bbPress, among other projects 
that benefit the community. In that, I find that Automattic stands bar 
none above other companies that profit from WordPress and yet do not 
"give back." I'm, of course, speaking of no company in particular and 
I'll deny any allegations to the contrary.

I mean, if anything, I think another really good example as to why the 
service shouldn't be produced "in-house" is to look no further than 
bbPress itself. Here you have a forum project that could have stood up 
with the rest, but somehow falls flat up against the others. I don't 
think Automattic or anyone else could have done anything differently to 
make it more than what it was. WordPress filled a niche and has since 
grown to be something a lot of people enjoy working with. Quite frankly, 
I'm not sure WTF bbPress is, but it sure isn't a forum and sure isn't 
one I would even touch with 8 foot pole. I think it is great that it has 
its own community, however small and loyal it is, but how about making 
WordPress stand up on its own as a platform for not just CMS and 
blogging, but for anything and everything.

I think the best things Automattic has done are things that the 
community probably wouldn't have even given the tools to do so. That 
said, I don't believe wordpress.org is open to the public. I haven't 
really been around, but may I see the source? May I contribute to the 
wordpress.org web site? I know it is bbPress, but I think it would be 
fine if I'd know that my contribution would be going towards something 
worth my time. I'm probably never going to use bbPress in any other 
avenue, but it it was simple and easy to "improve" the WordPress site 
and support services, I might step up and take notice.

I should probably end by saying that I don't really care about this 
topic, only that your questions sparked the quote. I think there is a 
disconnect with the community at times, which is damn ironic since Jane, 
you are most likely the closest and beloved by the community. Not to 
mention brought in to connect closer to the community. To that end, I 
think I've probably misunderstood.

Good day.

Jacob Santos

[1] I do wish to thank Automattic for the WordPress Tests repository, 
but I do think it stands also as another open" platform that I have 
found to be extremely difficult to contribute to and receive feedback 
on, so much so that I gave up on it. As well as the DocBook XML project, 
which I wish I had more time, energy, motivation, and was simple enough 
that I could do an "article" here and there.

You can dump the $wp_query array to see what's in it, look for the field 
you want, and go from there. Dump it like this:

var_dump($wp_query);

Then load a page and view the HMTL source of the page to see the dumped 
output formated with line breaks (easier to read that way).

All of the features of SE could be created via plugins for bbPress in a 
relatively brief amount of time (as in days, not months) by one or more 
competent developers. It certainly isn't complicated. Very simple in fact.

Where is this code being executed? If it's attached to a hook before the

I have resolved it myself by adding

*$wp_query->get_queried_object_id();

with the code. Now it's working fine . Thanks for everyones' effert :-)

I'm sorry but that is just rubbish. You wouldn't be able to create it 
easily at all - you would be able to create a half baked, 50% version 
easily and then spend as much time as they have finessing it to the 
final standard.

Read: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/07/code-its-trivial.html.

I just want the best tool for the job and as a repository of exporable 
knowledge I find the stackoverflow system to be the best - why would we 
not want the best for the community?

I feel quite strongly about this - the current forums work okay but they 
are hard to filter out the noise, all the badly written questions, and 
then there are thousands upon thousands of good answers buried beneath 
all the other stuff.

I realize that this is a bit of an argumentum ad absurdem, but here goes:

Is there a reason to rely upon Google for "official" search results for a
site instead of WP's built-in capabilities? Is there a reason to use Twitter
for an official micromessaging platform as opposed to P2? Is there a reason
to avoid coding a brand new webmail tool atop WordPress and use GMail
instead? Why hold weekly meet-ups on Freenode? Why not code an IRC-alike on
top of WordPress?

The answer to each of those is slightly different, but much of it comes down
to a single, UNIX-y concept: do one thing, do it well, and make all your
interconnects easy to hook into. StackOverflow, ServerFault, et al. are
spectacular platforms for getting questions answered and the skills required
to integrate them are far less trivial than one might think.  Personally, I
think that Automattic and the WordPress community could do a whole lot worse
than acitvely using an SE instance to answer questions once, and only once
and then spend the time and effort that would have otherwise gone into
making wp.org more SO-alike into making WP 3.1 and beyond the premier
content management and display setup in the world. The system, as currently
incarnated on The Org, is a recipe for repeated effort and frustration. It
has improved markedly over the years but still lacks a certain je ne sais
quoi. For whatever reason, the way that Spolsky and crew have implemented
"curated Q&A's" works at a scale that would benefit the WordPress community.

That's just my $.02.

Well, thanks for the heads up... but this is going to be a pain the rear.

Now I guess I'll start incorporating oAuth into my plugin.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinnAfw--nDXyhEv61WFl8jtjOaDiI_Vz80W4Br0@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to get proper debugging (breakpoints, profiling, etc) working
with Wordpress on my dev machine using Netbeans, Xdebug, and XAMPP on a Win
XP box.

Netbeans connects to the debugger and *will* correctly trip a breakpoint in
a single "hello world" PHP file and the wordpress "index.php" file.

However, when I set a breakpoint in a PHP file that's deeper in the tree,
say "wp-admin.php" ...the debugger ignores the breakpoint.

I can't find any useful information on this anywhere on the net.

Has anyone on this list been able to get debugging working properly? If so,
how?

It seems like that is the antithesis of user-friendly and would seem like
the opposite of what Twitter would want. I currently have over 13,000
downloads for my Twitter Post plugin. Many of those are updates, so let's
assume that 1/16 of those are legit users. Twitter really wants over 800 app
requests for the same app? And I'm not the only one with a Twitter Plugin
that allows you to post to twitter -- Twitter Tools has over 500,000
downloads.

I concur. I asked the Twitter dev mailing list about this, but didn't
get a solid response. I'm yet to see a good solution for this.

That is true. For oAuth you need the API keys. It is less user- 
friendly but the effort for users is bigger.
As user I always hated the Basic Authentication because of entering an  
password to an site.
Requesting the API Keys is 5 minutes work and with some instructions  
every user can do it.

What some plugins do is creating an shell (service) what connects to  
for example twitter.
In the plugin you will put the username and password for connection to  
that service.
The service will push your message to twitter.

From http://dev.twitter.com/pages/xauth

xAuth provides a way for desktop and mobile applications to exchange a username and password for an OAuth access token. Once the access token is retrieved, xAuth-enabled developers should dispose of the login and password corresponding to the user.
xAuth access is restricted to approved applications. If your application is a desktop or mobile application and the standard web OAuth flow or PIN-code out-of-band flow is not right for you, send a detailed message to api at twitter.com to request xAuth privileges. Include the name of your application, the consumer key, the application ID (if available), and a summary of how xAuth is best-suited for your application.
It looks like WP plugins like Twitter Tools, etc. would best be served by xAuth, since it's still authenticated by username and password, but is also still oAuth compatible. It's a bit more of a hassle for the developer, but it sounds like it would be much more user friendly for the actual users of the application.

I think it would be much better if Twitter allowed users to generate a
simple API key (like Akismet) that users could use for any Twitter App
without requiring the user to submit a new app request.

Currently my application allows all authors to store their twitter
credentials in wordpress. Whenever a post is published it can tweet to all
the users (or just a single user) -- depending on how the admin has the
plugin setup. Requiring oAuth essentially kills my plugin. It will require
each user to create their own app in twitter. It may be easy for you and I
to do this, but I get tons of support requests from people who just didn't
type their user name in properly.

Further, it may be easy for me to create a portal that does the work for the
user, but not all plugin authors will have the resources to build such a
portal. And building a portal defeats the purpose of oAuth, they have to
pass their username/password to a third-party.

I'm not saying that the move to oAuth is bad, but I think it needs to be
implemented in a different way to support the developers who essentially
drive traffic to twitter.

John,  for xAuth you still need API keys and Wordpress plugin isn't an  
desktop or mobile application.
xAuth is for desktop or mobile application where you don't want to  
visit the browser where the user approve the use of the application.

Lew, requesting API Keys for twitter is almost that simple as for  
Akismet. Only twitter want to know some information what the  
intentions are for that request.
The last solution indeed will pass the whole oAuth purpose. But it is  
an solution.
But users don't need to build the portal. You build that portal as an  
service to your plugin users. I do know for most plugins this isn't  
doable.

Yeah, that's a major pain. Plugin authors should consider that they
are not providing the Twitter service, but a way for the blogger/admin
to provide their own Twitter service using your plugin. That unfairly
raises the lay user's level of responsibility.

OAuth was made to be easy for users where "users" means people who are
not providing a service, even to themselves. It is a bit harder for
service providers (even self-service, like your plugin's users)
because they have to get an API key. This trashes your plugin's
purpose: "to make it easy for the user".

Speaking of portals, instead of merely providing API keys to end users
you could write your portal to be the OAuth consumer. This way you
would be operating a service in the model for which OAuth was
intended. You would need your own way for your end users' blogs to
authenticate themselves to your server, then you would provide the
link to Twitter. It would again be easy for the user, hard for the
developer/provider.

Yeah, that's a major pain. But it lets you provide the value-add.

You try to do something nice for self-hosting bloggers and your
favorite internet juggernaut rolls right over you. Almost makes you
want to drop Twitter altogether.

My users seem to have no problem with it:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-twitter-connect/

There's a fundamental difference in viewpoint here. See, you're
viewing your plugin as the "Application". Twitter views each separate
website sending data to them as its own "application".

I've been doing it this way since the beginning. It works fine. Most
users prefer this, actually, because on their tweets, instead of
saying "posted by Twitter Tools", it says "posted by User's Own
Website" and links back to their website.

If you still want to do it your way, then you should set up a website
of your own that acts as a relay for all your users. Instead of them
talking directly to Twitter, they talk to Twitter through you, and
thus through your application.

If you want to see what it looks like, take a look at
http://twitter.com/ottodestruct. Note how each post says "posted by
Otto on WordPress"? That's the application for my http://ottopress.com
website. If I was to publish something on http://ottodestruct.com, it
would come through a separate application that I created for that
website, and would show "posted by Nothing to See Here" instead, even
though it's on the same account.

Whoa.. Back up a second. I think you have the wrong idea.

Define "users" in your context. If you mean "multiple users on a
single website", then you are mistaken.

Every website only needs ONE Twitter Application for it. The
application is basically tied to a domain. Any user can then give that
application permissions to publish as them.

So your admin will create the app for his website, then the users of
that instance will authorize the application to act on their behalf.

Yeah, I saw/downloaded/activated your plugin... I still think it seems like
too much work for the average client.

Especially for a simple 140 character limit service :).

I use Netbeans 6.8 on a MAMP stack (Mac OS X). I think Jeremy Clarke on this list also uses NetBeans. For what it's worth, I beta tested the NetBeans certification and that makes me a Sun Certified Specialist for NetBeans IDE. (Queue the laughter...)

Back when at a previous employer with a windows box I had trouble getting NetBeans and XAMPP to play nice. I ended up using a separate machine with Fedora installed. I had NetBeans push files over from windows to Linux for PHP development. Worked fine.

You might be able to do a similar setup using a virtual machine.

Some gotchas: Zend optimizer and xdebug do not play nice, and you need to make sure to turn off any zend optimizer lines in php.ini .

Netbeans connects to the debugger and *will* correctly trip a breakpoint in
a single "hello world" PHP file and the wordpress "index.php" file.

However, when I set a breakpoint in a PHP file that's deeper in the tree,
say "wp-admin.php" ...the debugger ignores the breakpoint.

I can't find any useful information on this anywhere on the net.

Has anyone on this list been able to get debugging working properly? If so,
how?

Meh. I don't see that filling in a form and copy/pasting two fields is
all that big a deal for a site administrator. I've had nobody complain
about that particular aspect of it.

Still, there is always the relay/portal type approach. Although that
one is a lot more support and bandwidth intensive. Especially for a
simple 140 character limit service. :)

Well, according to the xAuth documentation (ht: John Bloch)

"Web applications that are currently using basic authentication can request
xAuth access for a short duration to bulk convert their logins and passwords
for access tokens with the understanding that the existing logins and
passwords will be securely discarded after conversion."

So maybe I can have my cake and eat it too :)

Otto,
How does this effect your plugin?  Is there something I can do to
help?  At the very least, I'd be happy to test for you.

Doesn't affect me at all. My plugin already uses OAuth and has since
the beginning. It's many other plugin authors that might be working
overtime to fix this.

Wordpress isn't well covered by SO, and, as said a couple of times

Exactly, with the current system, you have to figure out on your own
who the names are.  So far, I've figured out Donncha, andrea_r,
scribu, Otto and a couple others I don't know off the top of my head.
With SO, if a person with 10,000+ rep answers your question, it would
behoove you to carefully read their answer.

My opinion is that the questions that get asked repeatedly on wp-hackers and on wordpress.org could be answered on a WordPress StackExchange and the good answers would bubble up to the top for easy google-picking so that people wouldn't have to bother people with repeated questions nor would they need to dig so hard for answers. ?And the bonus is it could serve more than just hackers; it could help designers, hosters, and users too.

As well as the fact that many of the regulars on the list would be the

I'm still new here and to Wordpress related development, but since I'm

Same reason why people who can develop blogging software use Wordpress
instead.  Why reinvent the wheel?

This is just me talking, but I find StackOverflow and similar sites to
be extremely confusing and difficult to use. I would not use such a
site with their existing interfaces. I think they are a poor choice

Unless you're using MU or the soon to be MS.  We're running into the
problem of do we want to have one twitter app for the main domain and
use those api keys across the site (which we have to copy and paste)
or do we want to create a twitter account and app for each subdomain?

We're using MU is an unconventional way though, using it to
encapsulate posts and languages.

Subdomains, no.
Multiple Top Level Domains, yes.

You can use one Twitter App for the entire site, as long as it all
shares the same base TLD. Just create the app for that TLD, then use
it anywhere on the site, subdomains and all.

BTW, I just added pre-defined key/secret support to both my Simple
Facebook Connect and Simple Twitter Connect plugins today. These will
let you define the necessary keys/secrets in the wp-config file, and
thus override the settings page on each individual blog. I added these
specifically for cases like yours, where people are using the plugins
in a multi-site mode.

They haven't been tested at all (like I said, just added them this
morning), but if you want to try them, use the trunk versions of my
plugins:

Hi All, 

Is there is a limit to the number of WP instances a single MySQL database can handle?  For example, can a single MySQL DB handle 100+ WP sites? 


Thanks, 


Rex

I don't think there's any theoretical limit. As long as all the installs have different table prefixes and the DB has enough space, there is no limit placed by WordPress (I could be wrong on this, so please correct me if I'm wrong).

Eventually (around a thousand installs I think), you'll start running
into files-per-directory limits for most operating systems where the
number of files stored on disk (to handle the DB) is too many to
manage.

At that point you'd need to start splitting things out to separate databases.

There's no inherent limit coming from WordPress, it's all
server/DB/file-system limits.

WordPress has no limit, so the limit would depend on the number of
tables that can be stored in the MySQL database. WordPress creates 11
tables by default, so find however many tables MySQL can store, divide
by 11, and you have your answer.

Unfortunately, this depends on a number of factors. MySQL has
different ways of storing tables.

MyISAM databases store tables as sets of 2 files each, so the
filesystem becomes your limitation there. And that differs depending
on the filesystem being used as well as the platform you're using
(Linux, Windows, etc). The theoretical limits on filesystems and such
varies greatly, but on all of them you'd probably run into major
performance issues at, say, 30,000 tables or so. Which means things
start bogging down at around 2700 installations.

InnoDB on the other hand uses a single file to store tables. Its
maximum tablespace size is 4 billion database pages (2^32 -1). Since a
table takes at least 1 page, the max in theory is 4 billion. Divide by
11 to get about 390 million installations possible. In theory. In
practice, you'd probably hit the same limits.

A rule of thumb I'd use would be to limit the number of installations
per database to 1000 or so. However, you can create multiple databases
too, so there's always that.

You might ask the WordPress.com folks. They're running one big
installation, they can probably tell you how they've subdivided to
help performance.

All I could find for OAuth keys are these pages:
<http://twitter.com/apps/new> and
<http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new>

Both offer no I18n at all. The first page suggests that you may be able to  
listen the captcha words in your native language (it tells me: ?Eine Reihe  
von W?rtern zuh?ren?, but speaks just ? something I cannot understand),  
but in fact both offer English interfaces only.
Without Javascript the images are completely gone.

Since I try build websites that are as accessible as possible: Where do I  
send my users? Both pages I mentioned above are worst case scenarios ?  
there has to be something better, which I just didn?t find?

Not so far, no. But then, if they don't speak English, then I probably
wouldn't understand them anyway. ;-)

The Twitter new application setup page is reasonably straightforward.
There's only four settings on it that actually matter for
functionality, and in STC I actually give the user what those settings
should be set to. Even a user with a minimal grasp of English should
be able to work it out.

My main problem is the captcha: I can describe the other fields in the  
reader?s native language, but I cannot (or at least: shouldn?t) solve the  
captcha.

Are your users blind as well? Letters are letters regardless of the
language, unless they're using a different alphabet entirely and have
no way to type latin letters.

Yes, some are. Of course, the could just ask someone to do this for them,  
but this a really bad solution.

Even I often can?t read those captchas and prefer the spoken words. But  
they are just noise on Twitter, unsolvable for non native speakers.

Very low-precision numbers follow.

We have 10^8 blogs spread across 10^2 master servers, each containing
10^3 databases.

So the number of blogs per database is about 10^3.

We developed a custom database class to deal with this and we released
the main parts of that code as HyperDB:

Personally I would rather make our support forums better if they are missing things so as to give people on central place for all things WordPress.

We already have a team of volunteers who moderate that forum very well.

I also don't see why WordPress questions need a separate Stack Exchange site when they can already be asked on the main Stack Overflow site.

It is also not clear exactly which CC license they plan on using - and that has a big effect on how usable the data-dumps would be.

I don't think this plugin will currently work with wordpress 3.0  
networks or does it?

At the moment, no, it wouldn't. That said, WordPress.com uses the HyperDB
plugin, and WordPress.com is currently running a 3.0 network. As part of the
merge, we made some signfiicant changes to wpdb, and thus the plugin (as it
exists in its current public form) would crash and burn on 3.0. I imagine
one of the plugin maintainers will merge in 3.0 changes soon enough.

1000 blogs per database and 1000 databases per server.  Are these
physical servers or  otherwise?  And is there one master database
server that uses the slaves or are there several masters per site
group?

I'm interested in knowing at what the physical limitations are to the
quantity of sites in a single database instance.  I understand that it
depends on the OS, but I can't seem to find the actual number.  Like
linux is limited to this number of database tables and windows is
limited to this number.  Is there a chart or graph anywhere?  It seems
like this is something that should be in a sys admin "manual"
somewhere, so others can rtfm.

If 1000 blogs per database is what you guys are doing, then it seems
that I would have to worry about memory before site limitations.  I
just don't want to have to scramble if we hit up that limitation
before expected.

There is no such thing. Let me give you examples to illustrate why.
The number of files per table depends on the storage engine, e.g.
MyISAM or InnoDB. The number of files per directory depends on the
filesystem, which might have configurable limits. So there are several
factors that determine the maximum number of tables you could create.
But there are other things that limit the number of tables you can
have such as the amount of RAM in the system. Then there are practical
considerations: a server can handle one table getting tons of traffic
or many tables getting virtually no traffic. Some sites are
write-heavy while others are read-heavy, depending on the number
visitors and their aggregate behavior patterns, and the way that
affects your system depends on things like the rotational speed of the
hard drives.

That's just a tiny sample of what a sysadmin has to cope with when a
dataset gets big.

You're going to have to scramble sometimes. Growth a good problem to have.

Moderation is different than curation. Moderators are easily overwhelmed.
Moderators are single points of failure. Moderators can be prone to fits of

Because SO has many, _many_ other questions being asked constantly and
therefore it's a more obtuse experience if all you're looking for is info
about WordPress.. Additionally, the main StackOverflow site is focused on
programming. What about all of the other facets to WP that need coverage --
theming, hosting, best practices, etc.?

Huh. I got this from twitter tonight:

Hope that helps,

Brian

It looks like we can use oAuth for our one application. Say I registered a
plugin called "My TweetPress" as a twitter application, I could release the
plugin and use the plugin to do all the oAuth work on the one application
for all users. Then all tweets from anybody using "My TweetPress" would say
'posted from My TweetPress'. Now, of course, for security reasons, all oAuth
authorizations would have to go through a third server housing the
application's information, so that I didn't have to publicly release the
application's private key. But that seems like it would result in a fairly
straightforward and user friendly way get twitter integrated (for the user.
We're going to suffer).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Missing PHPDoc @since Tag in Some New Functions
Message-ID: <4BEA357E.1070103@htcomp.net>

Hi,

Is there a reason why some functions [1] are missing the PHPDoc @since
tag?

I started to add them and then thought perhaps there was some reason for
them being missing. I'm adding the new functions to the Codex Function
Reference and I use the inline docs as a base.

I can add a Trac ticket to "fix" omitted tags, but I didn't want to make
the effort if there was already a plan in place.

[1] Currently, I am working on the /wp-admin/includes/plugin.php
     WordPress file.

TIA,

Charles Clarkson

They are missing because we haven't got round to going back and adding  
them.

Patches welcomed with open arms :-)

On a slightly different but related note: how about a "Generate Password"
button on the add/edit user profile page?

Clicking this would generate a strong password (without symbols), autofill
the two password fields and display the password on-screen for the user to
copy.

It might encourage more users to use a strong password without the effort of
having to concoct one themselves.

My point though is that captchas are very rarely "words". Certainly
not pronounceable ones. They are in this case, yes, but that's rare. I
almost never see one of these.

Even Google's captchas are not words. Look at Blogger commenting, for example.

in there via javascript? Making psuedorandom numbers ain't hard.

Problem solved :) (Good one!)

There are definitely plugins that do this. Peter's seems to have almost all
the features I could want WRT 'pending' status (which by default is so
useless that IMHO it should be removed from core and be part of a canonical
plugin or something instead):

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/peters-collaboration-e-mails/

There's a good chance whatever you were planning can be accomplished using
that plugin, otherwise you can look at how it works for hints at plugging
the submit button.

I'm setting up a custom query for a second loop that displays on my page. I
want to set a custom field titled 'artwork_order' and be able to access that
field using ORDER BY in my query.

something like this, however this isn't working.

ORDER BY wp_postmeta.meta_value['artwork_order'] ASC

Is there a proper way to do this?

This is the biggest argument for getting an SO site.  People have been talking about improving the WP support for ages, but it doesn't seem to happen.  We get letters all the time to wp-hackers saying "I tried this to the forums and got no response, so here I am even though it isn't really appropriate here" -- so clearly the existing WP infrastructure isn't working out as well as it should.  SO exists, it works, and they're looking for ideas for new sites.  I'm all for encouraging a WP oriented SO site.

You can do that with $wp_query and get_posts / query_posts setting the 
params orderby to meta_value, and meta_key to "artwork_order" or whatever.
But if you absolutely need to use the $wpdb query directly, what you 
need to do something like:

ORDER BY wp_postmeta.meta_value ASC
WHERE wp_postmeta.meta_key='artwork_order'

With $wpdb->prepare, that'd be

(...) WHERE wp_postmeta.meta_key=%s (...)

And, though you already know that, let me insist again: it's preferable 
to do it with $wp_query and/or other API elements. If it's just for the 
meta order, there's no need for SQL whatsoever.

Thanks, I'm using a custom query because I'm also using the NextGen Gallery
and I need to query based on both NGG and custom fields.

Is there a way to access data from NGG with $wp_query, I wasn't able to find
anything.

And you may need to cast it as an int or multiply it by 1 or whatever if
you're ordering by number because custom fields are text type I believe.

Hello,

I haven't worked with NGG, so I don't have "much" idea about how it 
works (actually, not the least :) ). I suppose that it will use some 
custom fields of its own ? and if you want to use more than a cf, yes, 
it's outside the scope of WP_Query/$wp_query, which AFAIK only adds a 
single instance of wp_postmeta. Then, you'd have to JOIN twice or more 
the wp_postmeta, and sort accordingly. Be sure to allow for NULL if you 
need to ? sorting by custom fields is one of the best ways to get some 
posts "lost in limbo".

But if you can use a "true secondary loop", that is, a loop inside The 
Loop, then some get_posts with orderby=meta_value, 
meta_key=artwork_order passed with the order args.
Anyway, don't miss the good point noted by Glenn Ansley: if you intend 
to use the order as number (or date or anything not a string), be sure 
to cast/convert it or whatever in the query (and is quite possible that 
you'll need $wpdb for that), or use other tricks of the trade (like 
"zeroising" the value, which is not always feasible, &c).

You can use $wpdb->get_results to retrieve data from nextgen gallery tables
(as in fact you can from tables created by any WordPress plugin).

The best way to figure out how is to look in nggfunctions.php, search for
SELECT and see how the queries are constructed in there.

Use PHPmyAdmin to see the tables, fields and datatypes (nextgen gallery
creates three tables I believe).

Actually, if you try to use it for couple of days (they got huge
number of answers on various topics, and of much more quality then on
ExpertExchange for example), you will get used to it very quickly.
Very simple.

One thing I like about SO, is that when you start to type a question
it suggests you already asked and answered ones, which much more
intuitive, then - "search first and then if you do not find it
anywhere else - ask".

Much more pluses under the hood.

Hackers and polyglots --

I wanted to let you know of some changes to wp-config-sample.php in 3.0,
before I closed the corresponding ticket, which is
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11523. This may affect some custom
installer scripts or locales.

We changed the placeholders for DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD from
'putyourdbnamehere', 'usernamehere', and 'yourpasswordhere' to
'database_name_here', 'username_here', 'password_here', to make it more
legible, easier to translate, and less confusing with the "your" aspect (as
passwords here are not personal).

You're welcome to contact me on or offlist with any concerns or questions.

Thank you,
Nacin

Not to be too pedantic, but wouldn't these be less confusing still?

username_here ==> database_login_here

password_here ==> database_password_here

Subject: [wp-hackers] Filter display_name?
Message-ID: <op.vcmgchj7r6yny2@perplexifikator.speedport-w-303v-typ-a>

Hello,

I?m building a website where some of the user have academic grades in  
their names, eg.: ?Ph.D. Jon Doe?.

Now I want my users give the ability to decide if this title appears in  
their public name ? so I cannot just add the string to the first name.  
Unfortunately, the display names to choose from are printed without any  
filter in /wp-admin/user-edit.php.
I?ve added a contact field with the same key, but the original field is  
not completely removable because the table row lacks a unique id  
attribute, that I could address in a stylesheet. The visual result is  
somewhat confusing.

Any ideas for an elegant solution? Should I file a bug report?

Regards
Thomas

Seems sane, but the PHP comments around those values are very clear, so I'm
not worried. We just wanted to standardize the placeholders a little and
give them some breathing room.

Thanks guys,

So I clearly need to become better acquainted with the wpdb class but the
documentation is a little sparse for a challenging database query. How could
I set up the following query using wpdb?

$pageposts = $wpdb->get_results( "
   SELECT wp_posts.ID,
      wp_posts.post_title,
      wp_posts.post_name AS post_permalink,

      wp_postmeta.meta_key,
      wp_postmeta.meta_value,

      wp_term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id,

      wp_ngg_pictures.filename,
      wp_ngg_pictures.galleryid AS galleryid,
      wp_ngg_pictures.pid,

      wp_ngg_gallery.name AS gallery_name

    FROM wp_posts
      INNER JOIN wp_term_relationships ON wp_term_relationships.object_id =
wp_posts.ID
      INNER JOIN wp_postmeta ON wp_posts.ID = wp_postmeta.post_id,
wp_ngg_gallery
      INNER JOIN wp_ngg_pictures ON wp_ngg_gallery.gid =
wp_ngg_pictures.galleryid

   WHERE wp_term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id = '$myCategoryID'
      AND wp_postmeta.meta_key = 'gallery_id'
      AND wp_postmeta.meta_key = 'gallery_id'
      AND ( wp_postmeta.meta_value = wp_ngg_pictures.pid )
   ORDER BY wp_posts.post_title ASC
 " );


I know that's really confusing so here is the essence of what I'm trying to
do...

   - I am using NextGen Gallery to upload different galleries of images.
   NextGen assigns each image a Gallery ID (wp_ngg_pictures.galleryid).
   - I've set up a custom field for my posts called "gallery_id" and in this
   field I put the NextGen Gallery ID.
   - I am using this query to generate a list of thumbnails of all images
   that are in the posts' custom field from a specific category, so I end up
   with a grid of images from my posts in category X rather than the grid
   generated from NextGen gallery. For example I have a
   category titled "paintings" and a category titled "prints". When a visitor
   views a post in the category "paintings" they will see a grid of thumbnails
   built from all other posts' that are in the category "paintings"

Hi Brian,

Reading your email it sounds like you answered your own question?  I did a lot with NextGen Gallery and SQL on a project, if you can clarify your question I'm sure I can help.

Subject: [wp-hackers] how to use sortable and droppable together
Message-ID: <AANLkTinmZOZRyreBiBGSyK7c_EkPfwNPbx88MqEHxSRM@mail.gmail.com>

Hi my fellow hackers ,
Hope all are doing well . I am in a trouble . Could anyone please help me .
Thanks in advance .  Here it is:
I am developing a plugin to manage pages which uses jQuery. The pages should
be sorted using jquery(There is a similar plugin : pageMash), And a page can
be made child of another by dragging over it . But i am having problems with
using *droppbale* and *sortable *together . Could any one please tell me a
solution . I am attaching the code below..

*function to generate list of pages

*function get_pages($post_parent)
    {
        global $wpdb;
        $pages=$wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE
post_type = 'page' and post_parent='$post_parent' order by menu_order");
        if($pages)
        {
            echo ($post_parent==0)?"<ul class='sortable'
id='sortable'>":"<ul class='sortable' id='sortable'>";
                foreach($pages as $page)
            {
                if($page->post_status=='trash')
                    continue;

 $visibility=get_post_meta($page->ID,'page_visibility','true');

?>
                <LI class="<?php echo ($post_parent==0)?'my':'child';
if($visibility=='hidden') echo " remove"; ?>" id="recordsArray_<?php echo
$page->ID;?>"> <?php  echo $page->post_title."&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class=\"en_links\" id=\"$page->ID\">&gt;&gt;<span class=\"showopt\"
id=\"sh".$page->ID."\"> <a
href=\"".get_bloginfo("url")."?page_id=".$page->ID."\">View</a> <a
href=\"".get_bloginfo("url")."/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&post=".$page->ID."\">Edit</a>
</span></span>";   ?></LI>
<?php            }
         ?>
        </UL>

<?php
        }

        return;
    }

*JQuery code*
*sortable*

jQuery("#sortable").sortable({
             opacity: 0.6,
             cursor: 'move',
             update: function() {
             //alert("in function");
                 var order = jQuery(this).sortable("serialize");

                //alert('ORDER : '+order);
 var data={
         action:'save_order',
         ORDER:order
 };

jQuery.post(ajaxurl, data,function(response) {
        document.getElementById("ms_disp").innerHTML='Pages Updated';
     });


            }
        });

*droppable*

jQuery("li.my").droppable({
            drop: function(event, ui) {

            var object=jQuery(this).attr('id');
            inHT=jQuery(this).html();

            var h=jQuery(ui.draggable).html();

            jQuery(this).append('<LI>'+h+'</LI>');
            jQuery(ui.draggable).remove();
            var drg_id=jQuery(ui.draggable).attr('id');


var data={
        action:'my_special_action',
        drop:object,
        drag:drg_id
    };
jQuery.post(ajaxurl, data,function(response) {
        document.getElementById("ms_disp").innerHTML='Pages Updated';
     }
);
}
});  //end droppable

Thanks Mike,

I think I left out my main bullet point.


   - I have a second custom field in my posts that allows me to set
   display_order. Instead of ending my query with ORDER BY
   wp_posts.post_title ASC, I'd like to order by the custom field
   "display_order"


and secondly, is there a simpler way to run this query using wpdb class?

thanks
brian

What will your custom field's value be?  The name of a field in the posts table, or something else?  If the former, I assume there's a finite set of options which you would test against (otherwise you might end up having a SQL injection vulnerability?)

What about it do you want to be simpler?   AFAICT NextGen doesn't give you hooks into their queries so you'll have to do it with SQL.

Anyway, here's a standalone file you can put in your root and I think it should give you want you want, minus the display order I haven't implemented yet.  Let me know if this is what you are looking for?

I'm working with a WordPress installation where the location of the
wp-content directory and the plugin directory have been changed by
defining the WP_CONTENT_URL, WP_CONTENT_DIR, WP_PLUGIN_URL and
WP_PLUGIN_DIR constants.

Is anyone aware (just off the top of your head) of any plugins that
don't respect these constants and still use the old system of assuming
'wp-content' and 'wp-content/plugins'?

we should avoid them . i think it's not  a standard to use 'wp-content' and

Subject: [wp-hackers] Important changes to post type and taxonomy
	registration
Message-ID: <AANLkTil6M8NOmcId4h_B2phRVYp1CB0gc2T9ku3OmDJp@mail.gmail.com>

Testers and hackers,

We've made two important changes to how you register post types and
taxonomies. We've introduced two new arrays into the arguments you would
normally pass during registration: 'labels', and 'capabilities'.

More or less, label and singular_label is not enough for i18n purposes, so
we now generate a dozen or so labels based off the post type that can be
used throughout core, and any plugin can choose to register their own
translations for their own custom post types. (This also will apply to
taxonomies.) It isn't fully implemented yet, but it's close. We may
eliminate singular_label entirely, since that was introduced earlier in the
3.0 cycle.

Second, we've moved the fine-grained capabilities controls for custom post
types and taxonomies into a capabilities array. Thus, if you were using
manage_cap, assign_cap, edit_type_cap, etc -- all of those are gone, moved
under a cap object. ($post_type_object->cap->edit_posts.) Please take note.

I've also chronicled this in more detail (and arguably more confusing
fashion) at http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/?p=814. That post also references
the tickets where this was implemented, so you can look at the code if you
have any questions, or ping any of the committers etc.

Thanks,
Nacin

It'd be great to have all the same tools and features available to run on a
site powered by bbPress, but from what I've seen those tools aren't there.
When was the last time bbPress had any kind of update?

bbPress 1.1 is to be released soon. Also, for those who missed it,
bbPress website looks better now http://bbpress.org/

There are also plans to rewrite it as a new WordPress 3.0 plugin using
exclusively the api for custom post types and taxonomy. This was
discussed recently on #bbpress and #wordpress-gsoc.

For those who missed the wcsf keynote, there are also plans to move the
whole *press.org stuff to BuddyPress so I believe bbPress still has the
chance to get better (much better).

Jane is right, there's no reason to move all the data to somebody's else
yard, at least without trying to fix something by ourselves.

I would cede your point if it were simply data we were talking about.
What SO, et al., offer is /curation/ of that data.

At this point, I  think the distinction is roughly this: The DotOrg
forums are fields of wildflowers, weeds and prairie grass, with little
semblance of "here's where you go to find an answer to Question X" and
harried "gardeners" (mods) scurrying about frantically stamping out
"contributions" from folks intent on re-growing a patch of daisies
while a perfectly fine bit is growing over the next rise.
StackOverflow is a local topiary.

Both may very well contain the same "plants", it's just an order of
magnitude easier to find the bushes shaped like a Shared Host
Recommendation in the topiary.

Hello all.

I wrote a simple addition to a theme that adds a meta box in the add/edit posts screen. It allows you to use the rich editor to edit content that shows up in the sidebar.

The problem is that the dialogs for some buttons now appear inside the text area for this second rich editor. For instance, clicking the "add link" button on the regular rich editor causes the Add Link dialog to appear in the second rich editor, underneath the grey overlay.

Does anyone know why this is happening, or a way around it?

I'd say it's planting season.  Seems there's enough +1's from this list to 
get that growing.  If you don't want to use the Forums, then ignore it.  If 
you want your own, then start plowing.

May your harvest be plentiful.

Agreed.  

There are 25 cumulative up-votes on the proposal in 4 days which puts us in the top 15 of 121 StackExchange proposals where all other 14 top proposals were proposed April 23rd or sooner, i.e. they all had 18 days head start. That tells me there will likely be enough votes for StackExchange to be interested in launching a WordPress Answers Exchange just using the effort of the people who support the idea:

http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=site-proposal&sort=votes&pagesize=15

If SO plans to launch a WordPress Answers Exchange I can envision one of 3 likely outcomes:

1.) The StackExchange site will become very successful and will do a great job of supporting the WordPress community.

2.) The prospect of a StackExchange site will create a competitive incentive for those who feel strongly about not having an SE for WordPress that priority will go to improving the wordpress.org sites and thus they will become improved enough that a StackExchange site won't get much traction and these efforts will do a great job of supporting the WordPress community.

3.) A little of both and both sites will do a great job of supporting the WordPress community.

Looking at all three of those prospectives I can't see a negative outcome in the bunch. :-)

** We have also now removed singular_label in favor of
labels->singular_name. **

http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/?p=814

It is no longer being used throughout core in "Edit %s" fashion -- that is
what this system of labels is replacing. Thus, it no longer needs to be so
prominent. It was also introduced in 3.0, and it dies in 3.0. We are however
keeping the original label property ("Posts," etc.), as that has been around
since the introductions of register_taxonomy and register_post_type.

bbPress 1.1 is to be released soon. Also, for those who missed it,
bbPress website looks better now http://bbpress.org/

It looks similar to me.

For those ignoring the StackOverflow thread, I just thought that this was cool and bore highlighting:

The most obvious difference is that WP Questions, for better or worse, is
financially driven.

Another important difference is that Stack Overflow does well with SEO. I've
ended up on StackOverflow when Googling about WP a number of times, but
until your post, I'd never heard of WPQuestions.com. That could be other
factors though.

It's interesting, I've just gone back to bbPress after years of trying  
other forums. Currently writing a small plugin for it as well!

I really would like to see bbpress as wp 3.0 plugin.

Is there a forth-coming update to the Buddypress plugin, or has the upgrade
to the new ppP version already happened in that plugin?

You should probalby take a look at how the new menu UI in WP 3.0 works. The
widget interface should offer some insights too.

Plugins > Add New screen has a feature to upload zipped plugin. It

this interface?

I tried, but it doesn't seem to work, is it supported? Maybe I'm doing
something wrong.

Message-ID: <666cc1df-58fb-47d8-87bf-f530eede302b@a27g2000prj.googlegroups.com>

hi,
i,m new to wordpress. i,m in the process of learning the internals of
wordpress. i checked out the latest version in the trunk and learning
to create/apply patches.
I,m wondering how can i use the automated testing tools to test
wordpress. the documentation explaining this is not clear.

1. where do i want to place the test files??
     - inside the wordpress root folder or in a seperate folder? (it
is better if anyone can a screenshot of the folder structure and
attach)
2.i.m using ubuntu and installed the LAMP stack
   when i run   $php wp-test.php it is displaying a series of errors.
(see below)

can anyone help me with how to use the automated test tools.

Thank you, Jack.

I think this is the behavior expected by default. Fixed it though with
some hooks and transient manipulation.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinoaqxw_DXCaKP8k8cW0MfcQ_ewaIqOWtLnBmxG@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to load jquery and some other jquery scripts but nothing is
loading. The following code is in my functions.php file.

/* CODE START */
function init_jquery() {
 if (!is_admin()) {
// comment out the next two lines to load the local copy of jQuery
wp_deregister_script('jquery');
wp_register_script('jquery', '
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js', false,
'1.4');
wp_enqueue_script('jquery');
 //register Galleria
wp_enqueue_script('jquery-galleria',
THEME_TEMPLATEURL.'/js/galleria/galleria.js', array('jquery'), '1.0');
 //register Galleria Theme
wp_enqueue_script('jquery-galleria-theme',
THEME_TEMPLATEURL.'/js/galleria/classic/galleria.classic.js',
array('jquery'), '1.0');
 //register Galleria Custom Script
wp_enqueue_script('jquery-galleria-custom',
THEME_TEMPLATEURL.'/js/galleria/classic/db-galleria.js', array('jquery'),

}
}

add_action('init', 'init_jquery');

/* CODE END */


What am I doing wrong?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Duplicate License File in  @package WordPress found
Message-ID: <846401.39665.qm@web24108.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

WordPress right now ships with two times the same license file:


/license.txt
/wp-content/themes/twentyten/license.txt

according to a text compare, both files are identical.

twentyten is known to be part of wordpress, it announces itself as the following package / subpackage:

* @package WordPress
* @subpackage Twenty Ten


maybe only a leftover from older times when themes weren't originally part of the wordpress software package?

please let me know your folks considerations regarding these facts.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wrong comment and whitespace issues in seems_utf8($str)
Message-ID: <171687.91893.qm@web24107.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

On the last developer meetup it was said not to handle #5998 for 3.0, so the ticket got punted to 3.1.

Ticket URL is: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5998

Because of the punt, I added an interrim patch that adresses a problem with a comment (technical mistake in the comment) and some intendation and code-formatting issues within a single function.

I did not wanted to open a new ticket for these little changes.

It should be safe to add the patch to trunk right away. The only thing changed next to docs and whitespaces is the adding of an additional line:

$str    = (string) $str;

which is a cast to string only. If that is hindering a committer, please remove that line.

patch is here:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/5998/5998-interrim.patch

I would be very thankfull if a committer can just review and hopefully commit it. I did not wanted to open an extra ticket for this and when I debug encoding issues I need to wrangle a lot in functions.php so this would spare me some edits. Thanks!

Bundled themes have always been shipped with @package WordPress and
@subpackage with the name of the theme. We use subpackage tags throughout
core as well to denote particular APIs.

> WordPress right now ships with two times the same license file

The GPLv2 license is included in Twenty Ten in part because it is a distinct
entity and will exist on wordpress.org/extend/themes/ by the time 3.0 is out
the door. Core is licensed GPLv2, as is that particular theme.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Rewrite rules for combined category and custom
	taxonomies
Message-ID: <AANLkTilvrBw-QLWKtj02CbddX69QtlOPNNoe-K-10AqG@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
*this is my very first message in this list.*

I am having trouble defining a rewrite rule that *combines categories and
custom taxonomies.*
The latter is being overwritten by a following category rewrite rule.

*Is there a way to say, if the first rule matched, forget about the rest of
the rules?*
*
*
*This is the situation:*
I want to display all the posts in a subcategory, that have a certain custom
taxonomy.
But it seems impossible almost impossible.

URL Path: */especialidad/enfermeria/especialidad-cursos/*
*
*
Where
"*/especialidad/enfermeria*" is the *category/subcategory*
and
"*especialidad-cursos*" is the *term *for the *custom taxonomy
"especialidad_informacion" *

I created a rule that catches this
the rewrite rule is as follow:
*$rr_rewrite_rules = array(
  '(especialidad/[^/]+)/([^/]+)/?$' =>
'index.php?category_name=$matches[1]&taxonomy=especialidad_informacion&term=$matches[2]',
);*

Rules are added to the top of the rewrite rules.

Instead of staying in: */especialidad/enfermeria/especialidad-cursos/*
I keep getting redirected to: */info/especialidad/enfermeria/*
(*info* is the *category base*).
In one of the many tries, I got redirected to */info/especialidad/enfermeria
/?**especialidad_informacion=**especialidad-cursos*
*but i cannot reproduce that anymore.*
*
*
the custom taxonomy was created with the following code
*add_action( 'init', 'build_taxonomies', 0 );
function build_taxonomies() {
  register_taxonomy( 'especialidad_informacion', 'post', array(
'hierarchical' => true, 'label' => 'Informaci&oacute;n de Especialidades',
'query_var' => true, 'rewrite' => true, ) );
}

*
*attached is the rewrite rule plugin and the print of the wp_rewrite object
to see what may be causing trouble.*

thanks a whole lot for reading.

Hundreds. Maybe thousands. I have a local checkout of all plugins. I'm
running a search, and I have 291 results and I'm still in "b."

One of my principles of plugin development is to do it in an "odd"
environment. WordPress in a subdirectory, custom content directory.
That forces you to use the proper API functions.

It is likely the canonical redirect functionality that is doing that.
Your rewrite rule makes WordPress think it is a category query. You
can hook in to the 'redirect_canonical' filter to conditionally
disable this redirect.

Here is how it is called.

> $redirect_url = apply_filters('redirect_canonical', $redirect_url, $requested_url);

If you pass back FALSE, it will cancel the redirect.

If you hook in before template_redirect is fired, you could also
conditionally disable the canonical redirect code. Might be more
efficient.

This is how it is called:

> add_action('template_redirect', 'redirect_canonical');

Some test like this could be used to trigger the override:
get_query_var( 'taxonomy' ) == 'especialidad_informacion' &&
get_query_var( 'category_name' )

Mark,
that was exactly what i was looking for.
Thanks a lot for the fast and precise response.

This is the coded I added to the plugin file to disable cannonical
I am adding it so other people can make use of this.

add_action( 'template_redirect', 'rr_disable_canonical', 9);

function rr_disable_canonical() {

$category_name = get_query_var( 'category_name' );

if ( cat_is_ancestor_of( CHILDTHEME_CAT_ID_ESPECIALIDAD,
> get_cat_ID($category_name) ) ) {

$taxonomy = get_query_var( 'taxonomy' );

$taxonomy_term = get_query_var( 'term' );

$especialidad_informacion = get_query_var( 'especialidad_informacion' );

if ( !empty($especialidad_informacion) ||  ( !empty($taxonomy) &&
> !empty($taxonomy_term) ) ) {

remove_action('template_redirect', 'redirect_canonical');

}

}

return;

}


CHILDTHEME_CAT_ID_ESPECIALIDAD is the ID for the "especialidad" category.

Thanks again,
I dont feel frustrated anymore.
:D

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom post type conditionals
Message-ID: <AANLkTin2bNyImsEPcg83RgvCmDvvZvtQSXMll4dqyKo8@mail.gmail.com>

I have a site with several different custom post types and would like to
test (outside of the loop) which post type is currently being queried.

As far as I can see the only conditional available is "is_post_type", which
simply tells you if a particular post type has been registered, and with a
post ID passed in it tells you if that post is of that type.

Is there any conditional that tells me if I'm on an archive page for a
particular post type, or on a single page for a post type, without having to
pass in a post ID (so it can be used outside of the loop, similar to
is_archive and is_single)?

At the moment I'm testing $wp_query->query_vars['post_type'] but a
conditional would be much nicer.

Cheers
Simon

Hi Simon:

Have you considered creating custom templates, i.e.  "single-my_post_type.php?"  (I know that might not be applicable to your use case, but if it is...)

OTOH, if your plugin adds a post type maybe your plugin should be the one to add the conditional?  i.e.:

   function is_my_post_type() {
      return $wp_query->query_vars['post_type']=='my_post_type';
   }

You will probably be interested to see how we resolve:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12588

It sounds like we may end up adding an argument to is_singular(), but I
haven't looked over the ticket in about a week.

Mike: the function works great thanks (with the addition of 'global
$wp_query;').

I am using specific template files for both the custom post single and
archive pages. Ideally though I think having conditionals available is the
way to go, as in my case I am checking post type in header.php (and of
course using specific template files is optional).

Andrew: that looks good to me, do you think it's possible to add the same
argument to is_archive()?

Glad you caught that!   I realized after sending but I figured it'd be obvious to a fellow '-hacker. :)

Message-ID: <AANLkTilJzzxWylFmdSofi5OVjOq8qzTZ0XqV-CCKDJBq@mail.gmail.com>

No response from the plugin author so I'm wondering if I can get some
assistance or direction from this list. Here's the error I get when
attempting to upload an image using the "yet-another-photoblog" plugin from
the phloggin theme:

Warning: filesize() [function.filesize]: stat failed for /tmp/phpaAk9Pb in
/home/content/s/l/a/slapstick/html/wp-admin/includes/mu.php on line 15

Warning: filesize() [function.filesize]: stat failed for /tmp/phpaAk9Pb in

Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output

in /home/content/s/l/a/slapstick/html/wp-includes/pluggable.php on line 868

I'm running this plugin along with the Phhloggin ver1.3 theme on a WPMU
installation on GoDaddy. I performed this on a test server running
standalone Wordpress 2.9.2 and everything worked fine. I've also increased
the file sizes inside of my WPMU options to 100MB & 155000KB so I'm
wondering what's causing the issue as the image I'm trying to upload is only
136kb. I'm mainly hoping the error can be troubleshot to allow uploads while
on WPMU.

Any responses appreciated.

I haven't checked wp 3.0 just yet - having problems with spare time,
but does it provide  Add/Edit pages/menus for custom post/taxonomies,
or are they at least easy to create from the code? For previous
versions it was pretty hard to even add rich text editor to arbitrary
page (it needed some fixes in js and css, special div wrappers, etc -
which is not obvious for a novice). I wonder if there was any progress
in this direction?

Hi,

Apart from the hourly, daily and weekly intervals for executing cronjobs, 
is it possible to create our own intervals for cronjobs in wordpress? If 
so, how?

Warm Regards,
Raj

Justin Tadlock has written a great article on custom post types which
covers enabling admin menus:
http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/04/29/custom-post-types-in-wordpress
and you might want to bear in mind some changes that have been made to
the labels for custom post types and custom taxonomies:

I had build a another test with the custom post types. The goal is 3
post_types with the same categories, like a CMS function.

my source:

add_filter( 'pre_get_posts', 'fb_get_posts' );
function fb_get_posts( $query ) {
    if ( is_home() || is_front_page() )
        $query->set( 'post_type', array( 'post', 'iphone' ) );

    return $query;
}

add_action( 'init', 'fb_create_post_types', 0 );
function fb_create_post_types() {

    $labels = array(
        'name' => _x( 'iPhones', 'post type general name' ),
        'singular_name' => _x( 'iPhone', 'post type singular name' ),
        'add_new' => _x( 'Add New', 'iphone' ),
        'add_new_item' => __( 'Add New iPhone' ),
        'edit' => _x( 'Edit', 'iphone' ),
        'edit_item' => __( 'Edit iPhone' ),
        'new_item' => __( 'New iPhone' ),
        'view' => __( 'View iPhone' ),
        'view_item' => __( 'View iPhones' ),
        'search_items' => __( 'Search iPhones' ),
        'not_found' => __( 'No iPhones found' ),
        'not_found_in_trash' => __( 'No iPhones found in Trash' ),
        'parent' => __( 'Parent iPhone' )
    );

    $args = array(
        'labels' => $labels,
        'public' => true,
        'publicly_queryable' => true,
        'show_ui' => true,
        '_builtin' => false,
        'capability_type' => 'post',
        'hierarchical' => false,
        'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'iphone', 'with_front' => true ), //
Permalink
        'query_var' => true, // 'iphone', // for WP_Query Schema
        'taxonomies' => array('category'),
        'menu_position' => 5,
        'supports' => array( 'title', 'editor', 'author', 'excerpt',
'trackbacks', 'custom-fields', 'comments', 'revisions', 'thumbnail',
'page-attributes' ),
        'show_in_nav_menus' => true,
        'menu_icon' => get_stylesheet_directory_uri() .
'/postnavimages/iphone.png',
    );
    register_post_type( 'iphone', $args);
}

so it is possible to use all categories in all post_types, on my example
only one - iphone :), only a test

works fine without active permalinks and not with active permalinks. It is
not possible to vie the single-post. Also dosnt work the archive.

Please - is this a bug or a an error on my source.
Thanks for reply and time.

Best regards
Frank

Yep, a plugin can filter the array of available intervals and add its
own: http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/cron_schedules

It is possible. There are plugins like WP-Crontol and there are articles on
Codex and tutorials on blogs. Use search ("wordpress cron").

Subject: [wp-hackers] User & author capabilities
Message-ID: <4BF268B4.70904@mrhead.sk>

Hi Hackers,

I have few question regarding authors and their permissions.

I have web site with custom content types (for example picture) and 
users can upload them directly from website (not from wp-admin) and even 
if they have no permissions (lowest or none user role) they are authors 
of uploaded pictures (posts).

Problem is when i want to edit such a post as admin. There is author box 
but there are only editors and users with higher permissions. So if i 
hit save in edit post page then user is changed... So temporary i've 
removed this box from posts and custom content types.

Also i want sometime to change author of post to someone else but with 
default author box i can not choose users with low user roles...

My question is what is best solution to solve this ? Should i write 
custom meta box for authors with all users or is there any better way 
how to do it ?

Also i have another question regarding preview of drafts. Currently only 
authors and higher users roles can see previews of post. How can i 
modify it so also subscribers can see preview of post (but not edit 
them, just see preview) if i send them preview link ?

Many thanks for your help.

Best regards

Patrik

Capabilities manager should be what you need. It'll let you change any  
role's capabilities, or even create your own custom roles and  
categories.

Marvin,

That looks like a file permission problem (that the system doesn't have read
access to the files) or a potential block that GoDaddy has on that PHP
function call. If the plugin worked on a non-GoDaddy server and now doesn't
work on GoDaddy, then the problem exists on GoDaddy's end.

Hope that helps,

Tim

Hi all,

Here's what I want my plugin to do:

I want my plugin to map a URL on the blog to some content that it will 
generate like a form. The plugin generates the URL. For example:

http://www.myblog.com/my-app-reserves-this-url-automatically/

Visitng the URL generates shows a form. This web page is not a "page" of 
any content type that was created using the wordpress admin panel. 
Generating this page should not require the user to create a page or post 
manually using the admin panel. 

So my question is :

How can I map a URL to a function that will return some content that the 
user will see at that URL?

If the site visitor gets to a url where content already exists... the
single, page or archive templates in your theme would take over and render
that content.

Alternatively, if a visitor gets to a page with no existing content... it
may trigger the theme 404 functions. Maybe place your form in the 404
template of your theme, if it exists.  Not all themes have a 404 template

Hi,

I've already tried it but there is no such capability like "preview 
draft" i can only add "edit post" permission to user.

Also it will not help me with Author metabox...

Subject: [wp-hackers] Map a custom url to its content
Message-ID: <AANLkTim3mhnfYmYEoft0QGDzTASFFUiP4PYwV1Sj2CtH@mail.gmail.com>

There's a really useful plugin called "Fake Page 2" that may help with that.
http://scott.sherrillmix.com/blog/blogger/creating-a-better-fake-post-with-a-wordpress-plugin/comment-page-1/

it creates a new class FakePage() which you can call from your plugin/theme
with any slug, title, and content. The only weakness I see in it is that you
can't set the page template anywhere that I can see, so it will use your
page.php template for formatting. I've seen it used successfully in a couple
of plugins - G-Lock Double Opt-in Manager has a good implementation of it
for responding to submitted form data.

You'll want to use the template_redirect hook.

WordPress at the moment is a bit limited in how finely user capabilities have been separated out.

A good bit of fine tuning might be a very good goal for 3.1 so that plugins such as this can be done more easily.

Why not use some javascript to modify the contents of it? jQuery is
loaded on that page, and you can access it easily enough with
jQuery('#display_name').

The actual value of the element is sent back as is and saved, so
whatever you change it to will be valid.

Unfortunately, every change on the display name adds a ?-2? to the URL  
slug, so I have to dive into the DB anyway to fix those ?first-last-2-2-2?  
nonsense. I?ll drop that feature completely until I find the time to  
figure out what exactly happens here.

And if it's on GoDaddy's end - there's no hope. They'll blame it on you, 
your ISP, or anyone else who might be loosely affiliated with you 
because even if it is their problem, they won't admit it.

I've learned this from experience.

One way to do this would be to create the page you want and add
a custom short code to it.  Your plugin could then do the processing of the
short code and display the form and process it as needed.

Hi Frank,

Is this not what you need?

	register_taxonomy('phone_cat', 
		array('iphone','android','blackberry'), 	// <--- Multiple post types here
		array(
			'hierarchical'    => true,
			'label'           => array('name' => _x( 'Phone Cats', 'taxonomy general name' )),
			'query_var'       => 'phone-cat',
			'rewrite'         => array('slug' => 'phone-cats' ),
		)
	);

When you say function call are you referring to the 3rd error: Cannot modify
header information?
I take it mu.php is related to WPMU so could the permission issue be with
this file or the pluggable.php file?
I may have to move on to another theme for this particular project.

Thanks for the responses.

No, ignore the 3rd error. That error is only caused by the output from
the first two errors.

Basically, something is trying to run "stat" on a file. However, that
file is not there or something like that.

The theme you're trying to use may simply not be compatible with a MU
installation. File uploading does work differently in MU than it does
with the normal WP.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Search / Filter custom meta values from frontend
Message-ID: <AANLkTikbE6sqBq4lfEQUx2F8pVKTi84ENUD_NlQ5yBMp@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I tried searching different alternatives to my question, but I had no luck*.

I'm trying to get a search result based on custom fields meta data, say:
Price: $100 - $400
Location: Buenos Aires
Type: All

These options should be on the frontend and their values can be specific
ones or not defined (meaning, "all"). Is there any way to achieve this?

Result should be, as *expected*, all pages or posts (in this case pages)
with those values. I wouldn't mind defining the parent page ID where every
page (which I want to filter) is.

My page tree is:
Home
About
Group Page
-Group page 1 + custom fields
-Group page n + custom fields
Contact Us

*I found Scribu's plugin:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-field-taxonomies/ which looks
amazing but can't figure out how to implement it the way I'd like it to
work.

Thanks a mil if you can give me a clue on this one!

J

Hi Joaquin:

I'm building similar search functionality for a client right now. It's not straightforward but it's doable using hooks.  You'll need to hook the "posts_" hooks.  This page should give you some help:

i guess you can do it in a tradictional way.
create a rewrite rule, pass a query var there, lets say:
app=my-application-reversers-this-and-that , regisgter the query_var, catch
that query_var in your functions.php and launch the functions or classes you
want to.

Message-ID: <8ED3A0B5-DE23-41C2-AD57-615B7D169553@emrl.com>

This was mentioned by Otto on Matt Mullenweg's blog today. When I read the comment, I was right in the middle of coding up a dashboard widget to accomplish a lot of what he's talking about. I just want to see how much interest there is in this idea- I think there's a real need for it.

"Perhaps WordPress should try to capture that market. Make a ?simple mode? sort of thing. Eliminate a lot of the settings and such, or fold them down into hidden menus. Make the ?new post? screen the main screen, dump the pages entirely, hide all the plugins. Might help for an intro sort of view."

Thoughts?

I've got a client that wants to hide most things except for admin users.

BTW, do you have a link to the post? Would love to read it. I looked for it but could not find it.

I think simple mode would be a good idea, if not turned on by default,
somehow being an option at the time of installation and being very
very easily turned off, ie one click.

You can combine a few existing plugins to get rid of the majority of
the extraneous stuff you don't want. 'Adminimize' for removing
clutter, 'WP-CMS Post Control' for removing post meta boxes, 'Ozh'
Admin Drop Down Menu' to regain screen real estate.

Also worth remembering is that if you find you're wanting to hide
things like Settings menus, then you should think about using an
Editor account on a day to day basis rather than an Administrator
account (which is a good idea from a security point of view too).

This was otto's suggestion:

add_action('template_redirect','your_function');
function your_function() {
  if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] == 'whatever-you-want-the-uri-to-be') {
    // produce your output
  exit();
  }
}

This is almost what I want it to be. A detail that I forgot to mention in 
the first post was that the mapped URL should use  the template that is 
currently active. The content that the plugin generates should go in the 
content area. 

Any ideas how I can map the URL to a function and have it use the 
currently active template?

Thank you all for your responses.

Subject: [wp-hackers]  Weird behavior (maybe a "bug") in get_term_link()
Message-ID: <AANLkTik1yfxlvRfUEK9OH_rf7h8APy4ym4jiN2cNND51@mail.gmail.com>

I have registered custom taxonomy and what I do is - I retrieve list
of terms with get_terms(), then loop through them and generate linked
list with get_term_link(). Pretty simple task I guess. But it took me
an hour or even more to get it so. The problem was that
get_term_link() returned a link to a taxonomy page and not a taxonomy
term page, so that all links for all the various terms were identical
and wrong.

I checked everything step by step. term_id was numeric, taxonomy was
registered, I was able to retrieve term by mere get_term(), but I was
still getting blank urls. To keep my troubles short, I'll just say
that it brought me to this block of code in get_term_link()

if ( is_int($term) ) {
	$term = &get_term($term, $taxonomy);
} else {
	$term = &get_term_by('slug', $term, $taxonomy);
}

Turned out that it was triggering second call - get_term_by() and not
the first as one may logically assume. While $term was indeed numeric,
for some reason it was not being passed as int and is_int() which
strictly checks for integers and not general numerical values, failed
to serve the request in proper manner.

Passing my term_id as (int)$term_id has solved the problem. But I
think it's not what the one may expect in this case. Is there any
reason why is_int() cannot be replaced by is_numerical() ?

For mootools questions try their support, the admin-ajax.php script doesn't care which JS library submits the data.

Because slugs can be numerical strings.

get_term_link() has this messy behavior of accepting different types
of arguments basically just for backwards compatibility with plugins
and themes.  As you can see from the comments on
<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9323> my patch to make it
accept only integers went in to trunk long enough only to cause
backwards-compatibility issues on WP.com.

Make it settable on a per-user level for the base case.

For the case where somebody wants other users to see this, make a new
capability called "simple-mode" or whatever, then let them use role
manager to assign that capability to roles he wants to be simple. The
capability should override the per-user setting (and hide the disable
link... admin probably doesn't want users to have a choice in this
case).

If you want to use an existing template from the current theme, then
there's a few ways to do it.

If you just want the look, then simply calling get_header and
get_footer and get_sidebar and such will generally do the trick.
Basically, at this point in the code, you are the template. You can
act just like one.

If you want to get a specific template, then you could do something like this:
$template = get_single_template();
include($template);

But the problem with that is that you don't control what the template
is going to output. For that, to adjust the content and such, you'd
have to modify the query, and that's a whole different kettle of fish.

It would help for you to be more specific and explain what exactly
you're trying to do.

Hi dear hackers,

Today I came across a wp functions that looks like this *is_new_day()** and
what it does is: "This Conditional Tag checks if today is a new day." The
description is at the limits of lazyness I think :) Can anyone tell me how
does this function help a hacker to make his/her life easier? An example

Wow, that's kinda twisted.

It never came to my mind though that slug can be numerical. Yeah...
but that's even more confusing...

Hmm... I think this can potentially bring more awkward moments, once
people start to use this intensively with custom taxonomies. Or is
there some kind of replacement already?

The function the_date(), when called in the Loop, prints the date in
successive posts only when the current day differs from the previous.
The idea is that you might want to print the day only when it's
different.

is_new_day() provides a test for the same idea, but more generally
(not just for the date).

But I would recommend against using is_new_day(), as it makes big
assumptions about global variables and the nature of Loop objects,
assumptions that are less likely to be true as more developers use
custom post types and multiple Loops.

We've been working on PCI compliance issues ourselves. The thing is: if
WordPress does not govern credentialing for PCI-governed areas of your site
(I should hope not!), then I don't see why this is an issue. Provided that
you have a decent records retention policy for handling CC info, there
should be no real concern.

My advice would be to speak with a rep rather than relying on the test
results. Much of the problem can be avoided by keeping CC information in an
entirely separate database (the only issue I can think of is the possiblity
that someone could use WP backup tools to get a copy of the database, but if
the CC isn't in that database, there should be no harm.).

I've yet to run across any PCI flags that are tripped by WP (my job doesn't
use it, unfortunately). I'll be very interested to see what else you find!
Please keep this list updated, it's a huge issue for a lot of companies.

@Otto:

I'm using the method you posted, and its working fine, but I'd like to do
something else with this... how would I retrieve variables from the URL
using pretty permalinks. Say I have the URL 'domain.com/person/2', how would
I make the output on the page like:

"The person ID you requested was 2"

Hi Katrina,

The code cited in the vulnerability report is more than two years old and
was changed in 2.3.2. is_admin() has nothing to do with administrative
credentials, only whether we're in the administrative area. It is set by a
constant defined in the admin.php bootstrap and no longer relies on the URL.

The warning is thus outdated for any WordPress versions released since
January 2008.

Thanks Andrew.  Unfortunately Security Metrics says different.  Do you know where I could find documentation that would back up your statement so I could direct SM to it?

The synopsis is incorrect given your supplied information.

You state you are running version Wordpress 2.9.2.

I remember that issue as it affected problogger.com right around Christmas
of 2007. Mark jumped on it and it was fixed very quickly.  

Yeah... look at the disclosure page
(http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/485160/30/0/threaded). It refers to
"Version affected:2.3.1 (Latest at the time of writing)"  

The ticket the synopsis refers to "http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5487
Solution: Unknown at this time." was closed on December 28, 2007 upon
release of 2.3.2. The issue was disclosed, fixed tested and released in
version 2.3.2 within 11 days.

I'm not sure what they expect you to do given it is 2010 and you are running
version 2.9.2...
"The version of WordPress on the remote host does not.." is blatently false,
assuming you have your version number correct.  Could you have an archived
test site somewhere on your server?

Hi Katrina, yes -- http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5487. As Brian
says, Security Metrics says "solution unknown at this time". Yes, at this
time, meaning January 2008 in WordPress 2.3.1.

Something like this in your plugin would do it, I think.

function add_person_url() {
  add_rewrite_rule('person/([0-9]*)$', 'index.php?person=$matches[1]');
  add_rewrite_tag('%person%', '[0-9]+');
}
add_action('init', 'add_person_url');


Later on in your template, after the query and such, you'd be able to
get the value of the person variable with this:

$person = get_query_var('person');

I'm not going to go dig into code atm, but I wonder if YAPB is shared-host
capable. If GoDaddy makes you write temp files to someplace other than a
shared /tmp/ and /tmp/ is hard coded into YAPB, you could get behavior like
this.  Without looking at the code, it's just a guess, but I've seen weirder
things.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Search / Filter custom meta values from frontend
Message-ID: <AANLkTik99qLbWNZEiO8ZDi243ZkNGenT7Ea2e7Qumtc2@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks for the tip Mike! Unfortunately the page isn't as deep on the subject
as I could have expected. I just posted my challenge on the forum to see if
I can get any other piece of information.. I'm thinking a form tied up to a
query which will be enabled upong hitting "search" but it's quite too
technical for me at this stage..

How about this: You want something (eg a counter) to be reset at the first time somebody accesses your site, every day.

Hi dear hackers,

Today I came across a wp functions that looks like this *is_new_day()** and
what it does is: "This Conditional Tag checks if today is a new day." The
description is at the limits of lazyness I think :) Can anyone tell me how
does this function help a hacker to make his/her life easier? An example
would be perfect.

Thanks,

I think the name of the function "is_new_day()" might be giving you
the wrong impression of its behavior, as it does *not* vary according
to the time at which someone visits. Rather, it has to do with the
date of the current post in the Loop.

Hey,

Probably next week I will start with creating my own modules for the  
dashboard and the things what cam up to me where:
  - Disabling standard modules for users (now: plugin or hard coded)
  - Make one column bigger then the other one (percentage or pixels)
  - For network -> adding new user.

Regards,

Marko

Subject: [wp-hackers] nested loops in 3.0 trunk
Message-ID: <20100520105024.GL9819@nicolaskuttler.de>

I've been using the following code for some time to nest a loop into a page's main loop via shortcode.

<?php
function nk_category_cloud( $atts ) {
	extract( shortcode_atts( array(
		'category' => '',
	), $atts ) );
	$r = '';

	$my_query = new WP_Query( "cat=$category" );
	if ( $my_query->have_posts() ) {
		while ( $my_query->have_posts() ) {
			$my_query->the_post();
			$r .= '<div class="nk_category_cloud" >';
			$r .= '<a href="' . get_permalink() . '" title="' . get_the_title() . '" >';
			$r .= get_the_excerpt();
			$r .= '</div>';
			}
		}
	}
	$GLOBALS['post'] =  $GLOBALS['wp_query']->post; // restore global $post
	return $r;
}
add_shortcode( 'nk_category_cloud', 'nk_category_cloud' );
?>

In current trunk $my_query contains all recent posts, not just the ones that are in the right category. The $category parameter is passed correctly by the way. The same code works as expected in 2.9.2.

Any ideas what might be wrong?

When I remove the stray closing curly brace from your example code and
put the following in the content of a post, where "4" is the ID of a
category that has posts, it works as expected in trunk:

[nk_category_cloud category="4"]

Subject: [wp-hackers] Comments automatically being marked as spam
Message-ID: <1274366708.16755.11.camel@dxw-harry>

This has me really confused. I have a client whose comments are all (or,
perhaps, almost all) being marked as spam. WP 2.8.4. Upgrading is, for
the moment, not possible.

I have: 

      * Disabled Akismet
      * Made sure that there are no blacklisted words
      * Checked that it's not PEBKAC[1]

Is there anything else that might automatically be putting things in the
spam queue?

Cheers,

Harry

If you are using an older version of reCaptcha, the plugin was marking all comments as spam. The underlying recaptcha library needs an upgrade.

Hmm, we're using 2.9.6 -- so only one version behind. Do you know what
version was affected by the bug?

Also, the issue affects trackbacks as well as comments -- which I'd
imagine reCAPTCHA doesn't touch.

For anyone who's run into the strangeness around the_date() before its
worth noting that in 3.0 it's logic is broken into two functions:
get_the_date() can be used in the loop to just get the damn date,
while the_date() continues to follow the is_new_day() logic and only
shows once on the first post for that day.

So if you wanted to show the date on every post using the standard
formatting from the Settings > General page (I know, its crazy right?)
you can use

 echo get_the_date()

Or you could use the_time(). Which is the same as the_date() but
doesn't have the day logic.

If get_the_date() is ignoring the day logic, then that's a bug. It's
supposed to do the same thing as the_date() in this respect.

It's worth noting that is_new_day() doesn't actually work as expected
in a default loop. Possibly a bug. It's not used anywhere in core
though.

You have to have already used the_date() in the Loop.

I think we should deprecate it.  It's a vestige from the bad old days.

Those links point out that 2.9.7 is a VITAL upgrade to the recaptcha
plugin! They changed the nature of their service and updating the
library is mandatory or all comments are marked as spam. In my testing
I was actually still seeing the all-spam behavior with 2.9.7, but
updating the recaptchalib.php file from the recaptcha google code site
(not the wp one but the core one) made it start working again. YMMV
but manually getting the most recent version of the library is the
safest bet.

If you're not sure then try disabling recaptcha and see if its still happening.

ANYONE WHO USES RECAPTCHA TAKE NOTE! THIS IS A NIGHTMARE! You need to
upgrade right away and go through your spam queue to find the real
comments. Filtering for just comment_type=comment makes it a lot
easier (as trackbacks aren't affected and you might have a lot of
them).

I bet your trackbacks actually are mostly spam, did you try testing a
totally legitimate trackback?

If you do that then you need to manually specify the PHP date format
to be a date rather than the time. This makes no sense, ignores the
date format setting and completely ignores any filters attached to
the_date or get_the_date.

If I want to show a *date* I should not have to use a *time* function
with an override on the format to show as a *date*. To do so patently
weird and counter-intuitive.

the_date() and get_the_date() both use the default date format from
Settings > General, this is very important as that option has huge
effects on i18n of themes and on consistency of design. You can
manually fetch the setting and pass it to the_time(), but that is just
as weird and also not future-proof.

I think that get_the_date() should match get_the_time(), which is a
much more sane function than the_date().

The real bug is that the_date() includes some very idiosyncratic and
unexpected behavior without any way to turn it off (see the ticket
above for a brief discussion of why adding an argument to turn it off
is awkward).

What would make sense is if the_date() and get_the_date() did what
you'd expect based on their names: get and show the date with no other
restrictions. If people want the weird once-per-day behavior they
*should* be using a seperate function, like the_date_once()
(hypothetical), or else use a conditional like:

if (is_new_day()) the_date();

I'm willing to concede that modifying date display to actually make
sense in WP is probably not worth it, as so many people are used to
the old system and most existing themes already take it for granted
(though I suspect that most theme authors were surprised when they
realized how it worked, and wouldn't have minded if the once-per-day
stuff had never been the default).

Making get_the_date() show the date without consideration for the
$previous_day stuff is exactly what should happen, especially because
it offers a sane workaround for the legacy strangeness of the_date().
Now when a theme author figures out what's happening and says "WTF
why?" they can at least look at the source of the_date() and see that
get_the_date() is there for them so they can harness the standard
settings (and filters!) for their dates without rewriting the_date()
entirely, which is what most people must be doing to show dates on all
posts inside the loop.

Sounds like just one more reason to not use captchas at all, to me.

I use three plugins:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-trackback-validation/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cookies-for-comments/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/akismet/

With those three, I get maybe one spam that makes it through per
month. The first two simply block spam outright, without filing it as
spam at all. Very clean.

No captcha's necessary.

That's what I have been using and I think the the_date() functionality is
pretty annoying to leave it blank when the date is the same. I don't know
why it has to have that functionality at all.

I could not agree more with Jeremy Clarke thoughts.

Oh, I agree. It's there for historical reasons. So we'd need a valid
replacement for it if it was to be changed.

If somebody wants to make a patch, here's what I'd recommend.

a) fix is_new_day() to actually work.
b) change the_date and such to always display the date.

With that patch, somebody could do this for the "only on new days" logic:

if (is_new_day()) the_date();

I'd support putting that patch in on a trac ticket. Anybody who
actually needed that new day functionality (rare) could then fix their
theme up quite simply with only a minor adjustment.

I like the first suggestion, but the second one is bad. I don't allow any random website to install cookies or to run javascript. I'm sure I'm not the only one.

I use

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nospamnx/

even though it defaults to marking spam as spam, and not dropping it. And the plugin reverts to that setting after every upgrade. I use Akismet as well of course.

Captchas suck.

Yes, actually, I'd kinda sorta bet you are.

The number of people I've had complain that they unable to leave a
comment on my site because they disabled cookies: zero.

Cookies are a part of the internet. Nobody seriously disables them.
Javascript, I get. Which is why I use Cookies for Comments, it's a
no-javascript-needed solution.

NoSpamNX doesn't work, which is why I don't recommend it. I've never
seen a spam bot fill in extra form fields like that.

I just did an up. Worked for me.

Uninstall and reinstall, I think it's something unique to you.

Quick question:

Is it necessary to have files in the trunk of a plugin or are tags
enough?

You need at least a readme in the trunk so that you can point the
directory to your currently active version.

Interesting.. I was going to guess this was probably just someone trying to
crack your site, but those "attacker" IP addresses are from Google according
to DNSStuff..

http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall/?tool_id=67&token=&toolhandler_redirect=
0&ip=200.93.221.182
http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall/?tool_id=67&token=&toolhandler_redirect=
0&ip=66.249.67.54 

Now it LOOKS like Google is trying a bunch of different parameters on
index.php to see if there are different results available.  If that's true,
it will probably stop once Google decides they are all bogus.

Do you have something interesting on your site (javascript or dropdowns)
that would provide Google with lots of params to try?

great ideas(especially with columns widths - is simple but sometimes will be
very helpful for people).

>> - Disabling standard modules for users (now: plugin or hard coded)
are you thinking about adding to each module in configuration options an
option of access rights? or you want to make one plugin to control this
things form one place?

In my case it is disabling most of the Wordpress modules to all the  
users.
And working with access rights for own builded modules.

Building dashboard modules and how access rights works is something I  
am going to look in the next days.
So I'm don't know what the possibilities are right now.

Note that in WP 3.0, instead of :

$GLOBALS['post'] =  $GLOBALS['wp_query']->post; // restore global $post

you can use:

wp_reset_postdata();

I think a few thousand weekly downloaders would disagree with you:

Message-ID: <AANLkTikDyQs0ggWwasnLOHFyyEQYJk3rr5XZ-Mhrb0Pa@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

While using 'init' or 'wp' actions on functions.php, doesn't matter
how (even on a function that doesn't make anything), I get a blank
fail.

Is there any server-side reason why such calls result on this?
It's been hard to find out the problem, since the server don't show me
errors and I don't have access to logs.

Thanks!

Show us some code.  How are you "using" init and wp actions?

Would be something like:

add_action ( 'init', 'link_redirect' );

function link_redirect () {

	echo 'lala';

/*	global $wp_query;

	$id = $wp_query->post->ID;

	if ( $url = get_post_meta( $id, 'redirect', true ))

		wp_redirect($url);
*/
}

That already results on the error, but I would like to execute the
commented section.

Thanks.

"init" is too soon for the post property of $wp_query to be populated.
 You probably want "template_redirect" instead.

Message-ID: <AANLkTilyBuflWcXpTNDMBX0-1fXDqg7_3bJWZ7AMOZv_@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a classified ad plug-in using custom post type and my
own taxonomy & meta boxes.

I'm currently using the default ui for adding posts and taxonomy but I
would like to move things around. For example id like to move the
Taxonomy ui between the title and the post-area. Whats the best way to
do this?

I can bulldog stuff around with jquery but this does not seem like the
best thing to be doing
$('#titlediv').after($('#my-taxonmy-div').detach());

Does WordPress have a page size limit? I just put a long page on my blog,
and it is not showing up. The title and everything else is there, but not
the content.

I've never seen a size limit in WordPress on any post content. However, 
your server may limit the size of some data sent to it. For example, the 
Suhosin PHP patch (which more and more servers have these days) limits 
the size of individual variables (such as the post content) that are 
passed back to the server.

Would you happen to be using a lot of shortcodes as well?

No shortcodes, and the content is in the edit box when I got to edit.

Are you running a bunch of plugins that hook into 'the_content' by any
chance? They might be making duplicates of all that content in memory
and then maxing out perhaps?

How does it look in HTML view?

If this content was originated in something other than WordPress, your
content is probably their with some extra html or CSS that is causing
issues.

I'd start first with that. What does view source on the page reveal?

No plugins that hook onto it. It is not there in source view. And there are
no comments or anything in its place.

Is it possible to use wordpress as a logged in user without the use of
cookies?
other than passing the session_id in the urls, i would say it is not
possible.
how can validate you WP as a logged in user if no cookies are set

Drop in the bucket.

The fact is that virtually nothing works on the web without cookies
any more. Most of these "cookie blockers" I've seen know that. All
they really do is turn permanent cookies into session based cookies
for non-whitelisted sites. And that's good enough, because it's not
like I need the cookie to last a year when the comment is only in the
next minute or so.

Show the whole thing. Where and how are you putting this code?

A white screen fail on do-nothing code is more indicative of you
having a syntax or other type of error that has nothing to do with the
actual code you're using.

On a theme's functions.php, exactly as it is pasted here.

There's no syntax error. Tested with php -l.

That's why I'm asking if there's any particular or server-side reason
why this wouldn't work.

Something as simple as a space after the closing ?> bit might cause it.

If you have a closing ?> in the functions.php, remove it. It's
unnecessary and eliminating it sometimes solves these things.

I'm on Otto's side on this one. Session cookies are a minimum requirement 
for many (most all) sites now. 

Even whitehouse.gov which is barred by federal law from using cookies is now
seeking 
permissions to use session cookies as it is becoming impossible for them to
do anything
of substance on the site without some kind of temporary storage.  Google it 
for an intesting read.

All things are possible with software. ;) However, I suspect making it so
would 
be a huge project without much benefit unless you plan to do extensive
business 
with entities excluded from recording any user data.

true,
i would recommend to place echo "lalo" outside any functions to see if that
gets output, and make sure that file is loading correctly.

Maybe enabling WP_DEBUG in wp-config.php would help.

I'd say you're hitting the memory limit/backtrace limit of the Preg  
Regular expressions on your server.

wpautop and wptexturize can sometimes hit it with larger posts.

Have a look at phpinfo() for pcre.backtrack_limit & pcre.recursion_limit  
(Report back on their size?)

You may be able to add this to your wp-config.php file:

ini_set('pcre.backtrack_limit', '100000');
ini_set('pcre.recursion_limit', '100000');

And see if that helps? You could try upping the limits even further if it  
doesnt, just to test it.
(Note: Those values are what my default install has set, No idea if  
they're high enough, too high, or what)

Cheers
Dion

Thanks, I will try that. Is that in bytes or kilobytes?

Neither. They're the number of times the regular expression library is  
able to backtrace, and the number its allowed to recurse, in a extremely  
simple expression, on a large peice of text, it'll only use very little,  
when you use a large piece of text, with a complex expression, it can  
often cause the backtracing to increase as it attempts to match the longer  
text.

Other than trial and error, Its not possible to say what value you'd need,  
or if its even caused by this.

Well, it didn't work, so I added another 0 to each number and then it
worked. Thanks Dion. Also, how do I define this in php.ini?

I'm not entirely sure, But according to google, this should do:


[Pcre]
pcre.backtrack_limit=1000000
pcre.recursion_limit=1000000


(I added the 0 on there too btw)

Subject: [wp-hackers] exporting a file in wp admin
Message-ID: <AANLkTinaBdroho8m_-dziBMz5IGppOKc_nZdcvKZNIpy@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to send a spreadsheet created with PHP on a WP admin page
to the browser for download. The relevant code I've got is:

header( "Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel" );
header( 'Expires: ' . gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s') . ' GMT' );
header( "Content-disposition: attachment; filename=download-logs.xls" );
header( 'Pragma: no-cache' );
echo $spreadsheet;
exit;

I gather there's a few different options for the header settings, but
I think the problem I've got is more basic than that. What I'm seeing
is just the normal WP admin page, with the spreadsheet data dumped as
a string. These are the response headers (via Web Developer in
Firefox):

Date: Sun, 23 May 2010 12:28:56 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.1.6
Expires: Wed, 11 Jan 1984 05:00:00 GMT
Last-Modified: Sun, 23 May 2010 12:28:57 GMT
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
Pragma: no-cache
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=500
Connection: Keep-Alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
200 OK

I suspect I'm missing the trick of clearing the header settings
already specified by WP itself. I tried ob_clean() at the start, but
then I just see a blank WP admin page.

Any help appreciated!

Chances are, your code is running way too late, Probably after the header  
and menu have been outputted (Its about this time that the plugin page  
gets included)

Use admin-post.php and direct the download through that, no WP UI is  
outputted when called through there, and it'll be limited to the currently  
logged in user.

(Please do put a nonce on it though)

Hi Steve,

How about code like below.

---start---

add_action( 'init', 'before_submit_header' );

function before_submit_header() {
 if( $_POST['submit'] === 'spreadsheet_download' ) {
   header( 'Content-Description: File Transfer' );
   header( 'Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel' );
   header( 'Expires: ' . gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s') . ' GMT' );
   header( 'Content-disposition: attachment; filename=download-logs.xls' );
   header( 'Pragma: no-cache' );
   echo $spreadsheet;
   die();
 }
}

---end---

Lastly,
you need to add html like below to somewhere in your admin page.
<input type="hidden" name="submit" value="spreadsheet_download">

Message-ID: <AANLkTil3oSmafk97hgYDjQ5Mvv4b_J_yTA1dGope29uZ@mail.gmail.com>

Just curious if someone can suggest the proper way of supporting the
upcoming new hooks to comment_form in WordPress 3, while supporting backward
compatibility...

How could a plugin know if the comment_form action was called and is
hookable (ie: add or remove fields), versus the traditional HTML output?

Or am I missing something obvious?

You could try using did_action()

What are you trying to detect, when, and why? If you want to know whether
the hook was fired, you can use did_action(). If you want to know whether
the new comment_form exists, try checking if comment_form exists. If you
want to actually attach onto the comment_form action, then simply do so.

The obvious thing you're missing is that there really is no backwards
compatibility necessary. The comment_form is wholly new to the core.
If you're wanting to modify it via its hooks, then do so.

But looking backwards, there was no comment form in the core. It was
in the theme. So modifying the comment form previously required the
user to manually edit their theme. You had no hooks into it at all
except for the "comment_form", which was not always there (trust me on
this, the number of questions I've gotten about SFC from people with
weird ass comment forms is in the hundreds...).

So backwards-wise, your users will still need to modify their form
themselves if they want things there. But forwards looking, if the
theme supports the new comment_form() call, then they won't have to do
that any more.

Message-ID: <ffeee928-110e-4075-8713-320d9302c411@z17g2000vbd.googlegroups.com>

Hi list,

i'm trying to add options for a theme as a serialized array. Adding
these options (the first time via add_option) works fine, but i got
problems with updating the array. When i looked at several tutorials i
found out that most people use the settings API to update the array.
But at the codex i saw that get_settings is depraceted and replaced by
get_option. Is there some connetion between the settings API and
get_settings, or, to say it in other words: Is the settings API
depracated too, and is there another (maybe better) way?

Thanks!

Regards,
-K.

Just use get_option() and update_option().  They handle serializing and deserializing arrays.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp thumbnails
Message-ID: <AANLkTinPwJg_Odupq7-jmoiQhp5ZnR8B96w9y4OwnbaV@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys!!

I am struggling with wp thumbnails new feature. Basically I have an
alternative form to the "Add new post" for adding a new post with a set of
custom fields. I also would like to add on the new form the possibility to
set thumbnails. But it seams that the metabox has a lot of dependencies
spread all over the code. So I would like to know any hints on how this
actually works. So far I manage to set the thumbnail associated with the
temporary post, but when I submit something is missing and the thumbnail
does not associate with the post. I suppose that I need to add something to
the wp_x_postmeta table but I honestly don?t get where does the meta_value
for the _thumbnail_id come from...
Did anyone played with this already?

If I was not clear but you know how the thumbnails work internally please
let me know and I try to explain better.

Thanks in advance,

The Post thumbnails in core are set within the media manager, when you  
click the link to add the thumbnail, that request goes to the server, sets  
the thumbnail ID, and returns some JS to update teh main page.
The Thumbnail ID is the attachment ID from the posts table.

Another thing of note to you, Is that WordPress no longer interally uses  
the "-<time>" post id's, When you enter the edit.php page, a auto-draft is  
created, which is later turned into a draft, or into the published post,  
so the ID that you get when you load the add post page, is the ID you  
should get when you publish it..

Like Mike said you can just use the basic update and get options to
save settings in the database using your own submission-handling
logic. You can pass update_option() and get_option() arrays or objects
and expect serialization to be automated.

The "Settings API" refers to a separate but related system used to
automate the process of creating a settings page for your plugin. It
lets you define your settings using functions, then handles updating
the data for you. It takes some time to get used to be leaves you with
a very organized settings page and avoids a lot of bugs caused by
writing the updating logic yourself.

Subject: [wp-hackers]  Auto Draft problem... maybe
Message-ID: <AANLkTikCYwHLG9QjaALfcutHP2b72ug39rNjJWr78btH@mail.gmail.com>

Just installed WP 3.0 and tries some custom taxonomies/posts stuff.
What I noticed accidentally though was, that when I open Add New page
for my custom post type it automatically creates Auto Draft in
database, which is ok... I guess it is transformed to something else
after I publish post, but... what if I just leave that page, without
creating anything (for example I just wanted to check how Add New page
looks for custom post)?.. It keeps creating new Auto Drafts. Are they
cleaned up later on somewhere?

And why not to take already created and spare one, rather then create new?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using post_updated_messages filter and better code
Message-ID: <04c401cafc33$39d67c90$6401a8c0@dell8600>

Now that the $messages in /wp-admin/edit-form-advanced.php can be filtered 
by post_updated_messages it is possilble to tell the user that a particular 
post type object has been updated rather than just "Post updated".

In this example, is there a better way of manipulating the $messages array 
so the word Post (or post), gets changed to the word Book (or book)?


add_filter('post_updated_messages', 'apply_post_type_to_messages');

function apply_post_type_to_messages($messages) {
global $post_type_object;

if ( 'post' == $post_type_object->capability_type )  {
$old_label = array( 'Post', 'post' );
} else {
$old_label = array( 'Page', 'page' );
}

//for post_type book this should result in:   array('Book','book')
$new_label = array( $post_type_object->labels->singular_name, 
strtolower($post_type_object->labels->singular_name) );

$messages[$post_type_object->capability_type] = 
str_replace($old_label,$new_label,$messages[$post_type_object->capability_type]);

return $messages;

}

Thanks for your suggestions.

It looks like you are overcomplicating this a little. Proper usage of the
filter would be the following:

add_filter('post_updated_messages', 'nacin_book_updated_messages');

function nacin_book_updated_messages( $messages ) {

   $messages['book'] = array(
 1 => sprintf( __('Book updated. <a href="%s">View book</a>',
'myplugin_textdomain'), esc_url( get_permalink($post_ID) ) ),
 2 => $messages['post'][2],
 3 => $messages['post'][3],
 4 => __('Book updated.', 'myplugin_textdomain'),
/* translators: %s: date and time of the revision */
 5 => isset($_GET['revision']) ? sprintf( __('Book restored to revision from
%s', 'myplugin_textdomain'), wp_post_revision_title( (int)
$_GET['revision'], false ) ) : false,
 6 => sprintf( __('Book published. <a href="%s">View book</a>',
'myplugin_textdomain'), esc_url( get_permalink($post_ID) ) ),
 7 => __('Book saved.', 'myplugin_textdomain'),
 8 => sprintf( __('Book submitted. <a target="_blank" href="%s">Preview
book</a>', 'myplugin_textdomain'), esc_url( add_query_arg( 'preview',
'true', get_permalink($post_ID) ) ) ),
 9 => sprintf( __('Book scheduled for: <strong>%1$s</strong>. <a
target="_blank" href="%2$s">Preview book</a>', 'myplugin_textdomain'),
        // translators: Publish box date format, see http://php.net/date
        date_i18n( __( 'M j, Y @ G:i' ), strtotime( $post->post_date ) ),
esc_url( get_permalink($post_ID) ) ),
10 => sprintf( __('Book draft updated. <a target="_blank" href="%s">Preview

it will remain as draft if you'll create new page and leave it.
don't know about clearing, but I can give example - why not to use the same
draft(if it is fully empty) when you create another draft :
   sometimes happens that you need to create 2 pages in parallel, or you
just start one and in few seconds/minutes decide to make one more, and I am
sure that when you'll write in one page, you don't want to override those
information with information for second page, and so on... so how I know,
every time you create new page/post - it is created automatic as draft, and
the id of this draft is stored in this page not to mix things and to avoid
that I described upper.

Well, some kind of locking mechanism can be used I think, instead of
creating new draft every time.

I'm writing something for Add New page and need to refresh it
constantly and every time it adds new Auto Draft to a database. It
doesn't look like it is going to clean them.

In my understanding that's kinda leak... no?

Just ran across something that seems... not right. I'm adding a custom field to the quick edit form. I can add the field just fine using the quick_edit_custom_box hook, but I can't retrieve the stored post meta because the $post global contains the last post ID on the edit screen rather than the ID of the post I'm currently editing.

Is there a way around this, other than jumping through a bunch of jQuery hoops?

Hy,

i have a problem with shortcodes in post and pages.
The shortcode use strings with & and this will not read, when active the
filters wptexturize and convert_chars.
When i deactivate the filter, works fine - only when i deactivate the two
filters.
 remove_filter( 'the_content', 'wptexturize'        );
 remove_filter( 'the_content', 'convert_chars'      );


maybe give it a solution for this or is this a bug in the filters?

Thanks for reply or ideas.

Message-ID: <D0A6CDFB-F639-41F0-8507-D009DC1A37E7@olympianetworks.com>

Hi everybody,

I have a site that I'm developing on 3.0-beta2 right now and I've run into a very frustrating problem.

I have a custom post type called 'news', and everything works fine, for the most part. The problem is that, in Safari, only the latest post shows up in the feed. Everything works fine in all other browsers (even IE!). All other feeds also work fine, like the regular post type feed, etc.

The only difference between how safari views it and any other browser that I can see is that safari calls feed://www.mysite.com/news/feed/, while all other browsers use http://www.mysite.com/news/feed/.

Has anybody ever come across this problem before? How do I fix this (if it can be fixed)?

Thanks,

-John

When doing upgrades I want to avoid any users editing posts or leaving
comments leading up to the relaunch. So far I've had a lot of success
with just renaming wp-admin temporarily (ie, "/wp-admin-disabled/").
The frontend of the site continues to work but no data can be saved.

You need to also turn off comments in your theme temporarily (which is
pretty easy, only takes one tiny change) so that visitors don't see a
form that won't submit. You also might have plugins that freak out and
need to be disabled for the process.

If you meant turning off the site permanently as in archiving the
whole thing then the best bet is probably changing all user roles like
John proposes. If you don't want to use the user roles data (i.e. who
was what) then you could use a Roles/Capabilities plugin like Capsman
to remove all capabilities from all the roles except admin. That way
you could turn the site back on by just adding the caps back onto the
roles (might want to make notes about who had what though ;)

Hi Jeremy,

Thank you - and John Bloch - for your answers.

I tried renaming wp-admin, but the frontend site stopped being served (I had only a blank screen). This was fixed as soon as I renamed the directory back to wp-admin. If you say you had success with doing it, I think it is worthwhile investigating why it did not work in my case. I'll report back any finding.

Rgds.

& isn't valid html. I would guess one of the two filters converts it to &amp;, or maybe something else. You can certainly convert that back to & in your shortcode callback.

I see there's a shortcode_unautop filter which probably means that the other content filters don't care if they are inside a shortcode or not. Sounds like

shortcode_unwptexturize
and
shortcode_unconvert_chars

might be good additions to the standard filters, depending on what precisely the filters do.

If you say you had success with doing it, I think it is worthwhile investigating why it did not work in my case. I'll report back any finding.

My guess is that this would be a plugin that conflicts with the
process. YMMV with it of course. Renaming wp-admin is in no way an
officially supported procedure, I just found it works for me after
some tweaking.

You should obviously be testing this on a development copy of your
site rather than on the real thing.

Hello Nicolas,
yes, & is invalid and i have test this with &amp;. I had this not write in
my mail, sorry.
I have also read the source of shortcode_unautop and dosnt find a
shortcode-function for my problem.
I think, this is an problem on the core and this was my opinion for write to
wp-hackers.
Thanks, maybe i will add a own filter.

Message-ID: <AANLkTilUUiS-ad-n9kv6fSIxeCRQoHd3F3DYnYkB5uUl@mail.gmail.com>

In the function wpmu_activate_signup() in wpmu-functions.php one reads:

$meta = unserialize($signup->meta);

But then there is no call to update_usermeta() in order to copy the
meta from the signup table to the user table. Is this on purpose?
Something I'm missing?

I am inheriting a site from a client where the previous developer never set
up permalinks for SEO. So current link structure for a post looks like this:

http://www.site.com/?p=3103

Is it necessary for me to set 301 redirects in my .htaccess file for
http://www.site.com/?p=3103 to http://www.site.com/2010/04/my-post-title or
will Wordpress handle it automatically for me?

WP will do that automatically (as of 2.8, I think).

Redirection is built in WordPress so you don't need to do anything.

WordPress handles those (and many other canonical redirects) automatically.

Your best bet is to simply *try* something like this.  It's a pretty 
easy thing to test.  However, WP will handle the redirect for you in 
this case.

Hi all,

Is it possible to add our own content type apart from the "post" and 
"page" types ? How can I add a section to the administration panel that 
has the Add new [custom type] menu? 

Thanks

Dont bother trying to do it in 2.9; Seriously.

Instead, Use the Custom Post Types functionality of WordPress 3.0 (RC  
sometime soon I hope).
See http://kovshenin.com/archives/custom-post-types-in-wordpress-3-0/ and  
googling will reveal a fair number of other posts on it :)

Even for current installation, we can tweak the post_type field..  but code
has to be written for handling this internally

Yes, You can currently do it, but it isnt as supported as it is in 3.0,  
Its not worth anyones time attempting to implement it in 2.9 at present,  
given that 3.0 is nearing Release Candidates, By the time you finish (&  
polished) the development, 3.0 would be out the door.

I have a plugin that will give you the ability to add custom post types 
with the admin handling in 2.9, 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cms-press/.  It has its own edit 
screen handling built in for 2.9 support, but then will use WordPress's 
admin handling once you upgrade to 3.0.

Set up the permalinks and you'll find that it will create the
.htaccess for you, or, if it can't, give you the set of rules to put
in there yourself. After that, it will handle permalinks
automatically.

Warning: On some hosts, it can take a few hours after creating the
.htaccess file before the results show up.

Not sure if it's the easiest way, but I think this does what you asked for:

global $wpdb;
$taxonomy = 'category';
$query = "SELECT t.term_id FROM ( $wpdb->terms AS t INNER JOIN 
$wpdb->term_taxonomy AS tt ON t.term_id = tt.term_id )" ;
$query= " WHERE ( tt.taxonomy =%s ) AND ( tt.term_id NOT IN( SELECT 
c.parent FROM wp_term_taxonomy AS c WHERE c.taxonomy=%s ) )" ;
$query = $wpdb->prepare( $query , $taxonomy  , $taxonomy );
$unfertile_parents = $wpdb->get_col( $query );

That is, get from the database all the term_ids that are categories, and 
are not parents of any term in the category taxonomy. (A term_id can, 
technically, be parent of different children in different taxonomies, 
belong to more than a taxonomy, and so checking without the first 
term_taxonomy JOIN could render wrong results. So, we must resort to the 
NOT IN(subquery) because, say, all tags are terms without children 
categories...).
Obviously, you can change the SELECT and $wpdb method to retrieve the 
full category "objects". (Just change SELECT t.term_id to, say, SELECT 
tt.*, t.*    ... and get_col to get_results. &c.)

Please please don't use direct queries.

Not when there's an obvious API that is fully functional for what you want
to retrieve.

But does the query actually retrieve ONLY categories with no children?
I think that's what the OP was looking for, not simply all categories
to DEPTH=1

It all worked automatically.

Should I resubmit the URLs to Google or let Google's crawl figure it all out
until the indexed pages have the correct URL string?

I'm no SEO expert, but I can't imagine it would hurt to resubmit to google.
Personally, I use the plugin 'google xml sitemaps' for all that stuff. It
creates a very comprehensive sitemap (with lots of adjustable settings), and
auto submits it to google, bing, and ask.com.

Hi,

The codex page for the spawn_cron function lists a parameter called 
$local_time. 

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/spawn_cron

What does the $local_time argument for spawn_cron() function do?

Hi,

I have been going through the Function reference and the descriptions for 
both the following functions are identical. Are they functionally 
equivalent?

wp_clear_scheduled_hook
Un-schedules all previously-scheduled cron jobs using a particular hook 
name.

wp unschedule event
Un-schedules a previously-scheduled cron job. You need to know the exact 
time of the next occurrence when scheduled hook was set to run, and the 
function arguments it was supposed to have, in order to unschedule it. All 
future occurrences are un-scheduled by calling this function.

What is the difference in function between these functions?

Warm Regards,
Raj Sekharan

For those who for some reason can't/won't upgrade to WP 3.0, it might be useful for someone to make a quick "3.0 theme compatibility" plugin that basically does this:

if ( ! function_exists('comment_form') ) {
	function comment_form() {
	...
	}
}

...for each of the new WP 3.0 theme functions.

You could also do this if making a 3.0 theme that you want to make backwards compatible.

That is the time you want the function to use as the current time. If
it's not set, it just gets the current time from time().

The descriptions seem clear enough. They're not the same as all.

wp_clear_scheduled_hook clears all instances of a scheduled hook.

wp unschedule event clears a single instance of a scheduled event.

I don't think it's a good idea to cater to people not upgrading. If
they can't upgrade, then they need to solve their issues there and
then upgrade first.

If a theme wants to be backwards compatible, it can do so. It doesn't
need a compatibility plugin to do it.

I'm hoping this line is correct:
sprintf( _x('%1$s%2$s','1-currency symbol 2-amount','eshop'), $currsymbol,  
number_format($line_total,2));

yet a few of the translators are reporting that they can't  
change '%1$s%2$s' ie currsymbol/amount
to '%2$s %1$s' ie amount/space/currsymbol

Am I doing anything wrong, or is there an issue elsewhere?

I'm setting up some PayPal integration where I set the PayPal return URL to

return to a script that updates the database and then redirects to a

What's the best way (or is it even necessary) to verify that the db has been

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to create relations between custom post types?
Message-ID: <AANLkTinnETfMOdwzjc0BZDkpZ8iLZmr0GzYC-9zzZsHT@mail.gmail.com>

How can I create relations between custom post types?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Case: In the game FarmVille there are so called mysteryboxes.
A mysterybox contains objects e.g. buildings, animals, etc...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. I have created custom post types for buildings and animals
2. I have created a custom taxonomy called "mysterybox"

result: I can now pick one or more mysteryboxes with e.g. a building
(custom post type) so
that i can see in which mystery boxes that building was present.

If i now do http://myblog/mysterybox/mystery-box-1 I get all the
buildings, etc... for that box good!
If i now do http://myblog/mysterybox I get nothing as expected

so works perfect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The problem: A Mysterybox in itself it also a custom post type it also
has custom fields
like date, cost etc...

So I tried creating a custom post type named "mysterybox" and a "post"
named "Mystery Box 1",
which works. (so the custom post type name is identical to the custom
taxonomy name)

If i now do http://myblog/mysterybox/mystery-box-1 the taxonomy takes
however preference,
i do not see the contents of my custom post even if i create a
single-mysterybox.php, I
would expect to see the content of my custom post at the top and after
that the list of
posts that carry the identical taxonomy term.

If i now do http://myblog/mysterybox i would at least expect to see
the list of posts but
that also shows nothing (while it does with http://myblog/building)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
would it be possible to support cases where a custom post type and a
custom taxonomy type carry
the same name? I think they do not conflict.

(It enables creating relations between custom post types).


Another case would be where there is a custom post type "Address" and
a custom post type "Contact".
If every contact and every address is also a custom taxonomy of the
same kind I can choose contacts with addresses and
addresses with contacts (both N:M).

I've seen a few inefficient routines suggested so far, So heres a much  
simpler one which definately works in WordPress 3.0, And i believe should  
work in 2.9 as well:


$terms_with_children = array_keys( get_option('category_children') ); //  
Use the Option cache of the hierarchy to retrieve terms which have children
$terms_Without_children = get_terms('category', array('hide_empty' =>  
false, 'parent' => '0', 'exclude' => $terms_with_children )); // Fetch  
terms with a Parent of 0 (ie. top level), which are not in the list of  
terms with known children

var_Dump($terms_Without_children);

You can use either the $wpdb->update or $wpdb->query methods to update
the database. These will return true or false depending of the query
is successful.

To redirect afterwards you should use wp_redirect( your_url ) followed by die().

Message-ID: <AANLkTil0uHldLQ0_FUHQolJzfq5A-qnFTUZ4sfI1uA1H@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to use a custom capability_type for register_post_type, but I've
run into a few issues.

To allow a post of the custom type to be created and published, I thought
that only *'edit_' . $capability_type* and *'publish_' . $capability_type .
's'* would be required.

However, for the custom post's admin menu to show, *'edit_' .
$capability_type . 's' *is required. This wouldn't be an issue, except that
then when *'edit_' . $capability_type . 's'* is added to that user's role,
they are also able to edit other's posts of that type, even though
*'edit_others_'
. $capability_type . 's' *is not assigned to them. (bug? my
misinterpretation?)

Is there a way to allow a certain role to add new posts & edit those posts,
but not the posts of others? Something equivalent to the built-in author
role but only for this post type.

Yes, I'm working on a project that will do exactly that.  I believe that will become a common design pattern now that we have custom post types.

You will need, however, need to disable rewrite when you register your taxonomy by setting it to *false* like so:

	register_taxonomy('mysterybox', 'building', array(
		'hierarchical'    => true,
		'label'           => __('Mystery Boxes'),
		'singular_label'  => __('Mystery Box'),
		'rewrite'         => false,
		)
	);

You will also need to develop your single-mysterybox.php such that it loads and displays your content from your applicable mysterybox and its related buildings. You comfortable with handling that part now that you understand how to resolve the URL routing issue, right?

I've had to do a similar thing to this and start by saying, its not the 
easiest to do.

Like how Mike mentioned below, you setup both the taxonomy and the 
post_type, but turn off the rewrite rules for the taxonomy.

-For the taxonomy, give it a different capability strings so that normal 
users can't add/delete them directly.
-Use the save_post and delete_post actions to automatically add and 
delete the given term for the custom post
-Link the custom post to its term by storing the term_id in the 
post_meta of the post.  We've learned that trying to match them up via 
slug/post_name fields becomes a nightmare due to conflicts.
-Like Mike mentioned below, use the post_type's permalink to pull in the 
single-{post_type}.php and display the data from the custom post.   But 
then have a query_posts call within that page that pulls in the child 
posts based on the term set in the post's meta field.

Sorry if this isn't a clear explanation.  If you have specific 
questions, I can explain further.

thanks! adding and deleting them automatically was what in my mind
because else it would be much work. I'll give it a try to see how this
works out.

" I believe that will become a common design pattern now that we have
custom post types."

I think there are 2 routes:

- either via custom fields which carry the relation but you have to
set all links for yourself.
- or the route via the taxonomy as discussed (advantage=auto linking)

Apart from this solution i was also thinking on another one using
taxonomies: also "tag" the "from" custom post and then give it a
status like "sticky". Then loop the ones and treat the first as
special with some code around it. This is maybe a third one to try.

im going todo some coding :)

My understanding was that the original question was for top level  
categories without children.
If you remove 'parent' => 0 from the get_terms call, you'll get all  
categories without children, I just thought that seemed a bit strange  
myself..

But theres no technical reason why you -have- to exclude non-top-level  
categories.

I was implementing this for a radio station.  The specific post type 
that needed to be created were individual shows.  They needed a way to 
associate posts with those shows, so there was a show taxonomy and each 
show had it's own term.  I first attacked the problem by trying to make 
the show term that represented each show have the same slug as the show 
did.  The issue we had with this was when the client would create more 
than one copy of the same show with the same title.  Only one would be 
published, but they would have a copy sitting in draft or in the trash 
for some reason or another.  When this happened, it was often the show 
in the trash or in draft that would be the one that was created first, 
and in turn, it would get the term that matched the name of the show.  
This would cause the show that was actually published to end up creating 
a term that had a slug of "the-show-title-2" instead of 
"the-show-title".  So then when we tried to get the matching term based 
on the show's post_name, it didn't match up because of the -2.  There 
were similar issues if the name of a show was changed.

They needed a way to associate posts with those shows, so there was a show taxonomy and each show had it's own term.  I first attacked the problem by trying to make the show term that represented each show have the same slug as the show did.  The issue we had with this was when the client would create more than one copy of the same show with the same title.  Only one would be published, but they would have a copy sitting in draft or in the trash for some reason or another.  When this happened, it was often the show in the trash or in draft that would be the one that was created first, and in turn, it would get the term that matched the name of the show.

Thanks a bunch for explaining.  it was a lot of writing but that kind of use-case discussion is really helpful for me and I expect for future people googling for these issues.

Sounds like your client is running into the issue that this ticket was created to address?

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11863

Of the three WP3.0 projects I'm currently working on I've run into trouble with trashed slugs keeping the user from achieving what they want in all three projects, and either having the users get really frustrated or confused by it and/or I then tell them they have to click many times to resolve each post (once they realize what the problem is, which is rarely obvious to them.) 

Often they don't realize they've created a problem until a while after they created the post that got assigned a slug other than what they wanted/expected. Unfortunately  the consensus on the ticket was to favor the trashed post and not the new post.  If my three projects are any indication a lot of people will experience similar frustrations and if so I hope the deciders will be willing to rethink the resolution.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Recommended way to change column name?
Message-ID: <000a01caffee$efd1e4d0$cf75ae70$@com>

I have a plugin which has its own tables.  One of the tables I had created a
while back for some future functionality that I am just getting to
implementing.  In the course of working on it I decided that I didn't need
several of the columns and more importantly, I wanted to change the name of
the primary index column to be more descriptive than the generic "id" name I
gave it originally.

 

I use dbDelta() to create my tables.  So I changed the SQL to reflect the
new updated table I wanted but the call to dbDelta() doesn't seem to have
any affect other than adding columns.  Doing some searching it appears
dbDelta() has some limitations and I am wondering if changing column names
is one of them.  Because I have never used this table I suppose I could
check for existence and drop it and let dbDelta() recreate it but I am
wondering what the recommended way to make table changes is?

 

Thanks,

 

Mike

Message-ID: <AANLkTilVSpX5mPRbg6UijSleMCpj5AoysS1B6NSQnh_c@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to use a custom capability_type in a call to register_post_type,
but I've run into a few issues.

For example, to allow a post of the custom type "movies" to be created and
published, I thought that *'edit_movie'* and *'publish_**movie**s'* would be
the only capabilities required.

For the Movies admin menu to show however, *'edit**_movie**s' *is required
(note the "s"). This wouldn't be an issue, except that then when *'edit_**
movie**s'* is added to that user's role, they are also able to edit movies
created by others, even though *'edit_others**_movie**s' *is not assigned to
them. Is this a bug? My misinterpretation? Or are custom post type
capabilities still a work in progress?

It looks like that last part is a bug, which I will look into. The rest of
it comes down to an understanding of the difference between the edit_post
and edit_posts capabilities.

edit_posts is a primitive capability, thus the user or role is literally
given this capability, not unlike manage_options or any of the others.

edit_post is a meta capability. The user/role is NOT given this capability
(doing so would do nothing). Instead, current_user_can is called with this
capability and the post ID is also passed. The function map_meta_cap then
maps it to the correct primitive capability based on the post -- if it is a
published post, they would need edit_publish_posts, if it is someone else's
post, they would need edit_others_posts, etc.

Meta capabilities are never plural -- read_post, edit_post, delete_post,
delete_user, etc. There's a full list of them in the inline documentation of
map_meta_cap().

Correct, dbDelta does not drop or rename fields; it only can alter the
properties of them, along with indexes, etc. You would make SQL calls
manually during an upgrade routine to alter any fields. (This is also how
core does this.)

Hi,
I have several picture galleries in NGG and have restricted access to
editing rights only to users owners of their own created galleries,
however they can still see all other galleries even though they cannot
edit them and this makes it hard for them to go straight to those they
want to edit.

I have no idea what is the function to tackle in NGG to mod this. If
anyone would be so kind to let me know, I would offer eternal
gratitude (which these days is of great value)!
Thanks in advance

use this to register header and footer of your table:

register_column_headers($current_screen, array( 'cb' => '<input type="checkbox">', 'title' => "Title", 'author' => "Author", 'categories' => "Categories", 'date' => "Date"));

and use this to print your header inner table:

<?php print_column_headers( $current_screen );  ?>

I was just asking if anyone knew of a way to relate posts by  the date they
were published.
I've searched extensively for leads and haven't seen any material on this
way of grouping posts.There are published,proven ways and plugins to relate
posts by content,title or tags but not by similar time and date unless you
use custom fields but that would mean adding custom fields to already
published posts and would be a lot of work.The one thing these posts have in
common is they were all published at the same time. I'm not an expert and
that is why I came here. It isn't exactly a support question because it
isn't about a particular plugin or a problem I am having getting wordpress
to work. I guess I should not have mentioned a plugin.

No problem. Also, I can't seem to reproduce a bug involving post
capabilities, so it is probably due to use of the different types of
capabilities.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Problems under IIs
Message-ID: <AANLkTimO4CT-9BnUfAxmtRvp-wgpx88F6Z2XvoDLs-qN@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, list!

I've ran into a lot of problems while running WordPress on IIs in
Windows Server 2008. The problems seem to be fixed, but I don't know
exactly what happened - and what I did to fix it. And also, there's
not big complaints about WordPress and this server on the web.

Basically, what happened is that the server stopped to accept more
than 5 or 6 simultaneous connections (opening them on different
computers or in multiple tabs on any browser), and then PHP would go
down.

I did some tests with other big PHP routines that took more than 20
seconds to be processed, and couldn't find any problem trying to open
as many connections as I wanted. PHP, IIs and MySQL logs didn't show
anything but the shutdown message on the PHP one.

That don't seem to be a WordPress issue, but only happened with
WordPress... that's quite bizarre.
Any ideas or suggestions would be really welcome. =D

Thanks.

Use a new WP_Query in your loop and use the time parameters 'day', 
'monthnum', and 'year', along with 'category__not_in' argument.  See 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_posts for a list of the 
arguments available.

A quick search of the forums found a least one example that has some ideas 
you can use:

Then you'll need the Settings -> Permalinks menu. It's called the tag base.

In the future, please use the support forums for these type of
questions as the wp-hackers list is specifically for development and
hacking of WordPress. Thanks!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Category/Tag/Taxonomy Meta Data
Message-ID: <AANLkTikrA6BxNo5Xhk5SfpRrHf6yu73RAxTNCxcU7s4y@mail.gmail.com>

I notice that there is an action hook that allows you to add extra form
fields to the Edit Category/Tag/Tax page, {taxonomy}_edit_form_fields, which
is VERY cool. But this action hook seems pretty useless unless the new form
field you insert actually allows you to save some extra data.

For instance, let's say that I wanted to add another textarea that allowed a
user to insert a "short" description of the category to be used somewhere in
the theme. I can figure out how to insert the form field, but I can't figure
out why the data won't actually save. I imagine there's some sort of
sanitization going on that limits what can and can't be saved, but is there
any way to bypass that?

Bottom line ... is there any way to add extra fields of data, without
resorting to storing this data in the options table? We have this sort of
thing in place for posts (postmeta), comments (commentmeta), and users
(usermeta), but it would be cool if it could be done with taxonomies too.

Thanks!

Hi Nathan,
I like you're idea about using the taxonomies tables (via twitter).
What about something like the following:

On plugin activation or another 'fire once conditional', create 1) a
custom taxonomy and 2) terms in that custom taxonomy (for your custom
fields):
* register_new_taxonomy( 'my_tax_custom_fields', $args );
* wp_insert_term( 'field_name', 'my_tax_custom_fields, $args );
* wp_insert_term( 'field_two_name', 'my_tax_custom_fields, $args );

Then, on creation / edit of category or ( hooked into
{taxonomy}_edit_form_fields ):
* wp_set_object_terms( ID_OF_Cat/Term_Just_create_or_modified,
array('field_two_name'), 'my_tax_custom_fields' );

Then, to retrieve that information when displaying in theme or for
updating data, you could use:
* wp_get_object_terms( ID_OF_Cat/Term_Just_create_or_modified,
'my_tax_custom_fields', $args );

That is very rough and not tested but it would theoretically
accomplish the following:
* Keeps values out of options table
* Add's values to wp_term_taxonomy table

Possible cons:
* You're actually creating more database calls and PHP code by keeping
it out of options table
* Possible clash of post IDs and term IDs if some foreign code assigns
your custom taxes to a post rather than another taxonomy for some
reason.

That would do probably do it. I'm sure there's a hurdle in there
somewhere I didn't foresee... although after processing this, I'm
really wondering if its worth the trouble to remove data from the
options table. Why do you want to do that?

The best solution would be a new table called wp_taxonomymeta ;)

Well, there are two sets of actions here. On the one side, there are 
hooks to *display* the fields (like edit_category_form and edit_tag_form 
in 2.9.x and earlier; I understand that the {taxonomy}... are new to 3.0? ).
To *save* them, you must add another action to edited_category or 
edited_term hooks, and use the vars passed via $_POST (I don't remember 
right now if they can take additional args, that'd be worth a look).
Quite like meta boxes, indeed...
(At least, that's how I do it in 2.9, and works fine & nice. Dunno if 
the procedure is supposed to change in 3.0.)

AFAIK, the only suitable place in a out-of-the-box WP installation is 
the options table. But a table (termmeta) can be added; there're some 
plugins which do that, there's dbDelta...
I'd say that the taxonomymeta which Glenn Ansley mentions, and 
wp_object_relationships_meta would be really sweet tables too :)

I fall back to the idea of deprecating wp_term_taxonomy and replacing with wp_post->post_type="term_taxonomy."  That would provide term-meta as well as other things, "for free." But I digress...
