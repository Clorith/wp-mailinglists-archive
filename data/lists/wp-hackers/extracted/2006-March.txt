I realize that this does not affect everyone - in fact it only affects those
of us who do mass installs of WP.  I'd like a wp-unattended.ini file that
most, if not all, of the options could be set via the file for automated
installs and then, for security, WordPress will not function outside of the
install while the file exists (it must be deleted post-install).

This will make configuration of WordPress much easier on an automated level
though it will only be beneficial to a handful of us, I think.

Thoughts?

    SUCCESS!  Thank you, sir.  Thank you most kindly.  I've already 
released Gatekeeper 1.5 RC5 and will blog it later today.
    I still think it's strange to do the gzipping before all but one 
other action.  Anyone have a good explanation why that's a good idea, 
as opposed to a bad one?

That's brilliant.  A filter hook, I hadn't thought of that.  It is 
exactly what I'm looking for.   Thank you.

I'm not really concerned about the URI looking pretty, just that the end 
user doesn't have to do anything to make the page appear.

Is there a full list of hooks around?  I couldn't find anything to do 
with wp_list_pages on the Codex ... or does every function that returns 
output have a filter/hook attached to it?

Actually I am working on a loadbalancer/downloadmanager-Plugin, and I

"category_allow" :-)

Sorry, I didn't think about looking for a plugin that does that since
you cannot add a role through the interface. hmm..next time.

I's an interesting concept, but it could probably be made as a plugin.  All
of settings, save the db connect info, are saved in just a couple tables.  I
can't see any reason why a plugin couldnt export/import these settings.

How about making this a web page instead of posting it to the list?

The size of the stats message is the equivalent of 14.2 average messages
on this list, so it is quite a bit of unnecessary bandwidth use to reach
the kill files...

Subject: [wp-hackers] Is there a page limit?
Message-ID: <440637D2.2060902@harnish.ca>

I ran into an interesting problem ... that is perhaps unique ... I'm not 
sure.

For one theme, I wanted to restrict the number of posts to 4 and exclude 
an aside category and still page correctly.   As such, I made a new 
WP_query and set it to $wpquery in the index.php of the template ... 
everything worked well except paging.

Normally I'd have 102 pages at 10 pages a post.  At 4, I have 293 pages 
... Anyway, the problem is once I page past 102, I start getting 404 
errors ... of course this is because $wpquery that runs earlier had no 
data ...

Is there any 'good' way to override the default number of posts in a 
theme?  I mean, I have other themes and I don't want to reduce them to 
four posts a page ... just this new one.  If I was increasing the 
number, it work fine ... but since I'm decreasing it ...  I'm figuring 
someone might run into this excluding aside categories as well.

This  doesn't  sound like a WordPress plug-in per se. It sounds like  what
you  need a peripheral file and a hook to 'grab' it. Why not just copy the
contents  of one database onto another, either in full or in part? I  have
used this approach to instantiate cutomised, identical Wikis at ease.

Best wishes,

Message-ID: <1141288888.m2f.12710@wpg2.ozgreg.com>


As part of the next release of the WPG2 plugin I have switched the plugin over to the roles / caps from the old userlevels.

To handle some of the Gallery2 security aspects I have added two new caps however unless I am missing something here remove_cap($cap) just  unsets the cap it actually does not remove that cap from the role.

Am I overlooking something here or is it not possible to clean up any custom caps if the plugin has been deactivated?

I've been cleaning up the wp_list_*() and wp_dropdown_*() template 
functions in trunk.  While we're in there, we can add filters for the 
array of arguments passed to these functions, the array of 
categories/pages returned from the query, and whatever other filters may 
be useful.  We could even allow changing the callbacks passed to the 
tree walker.

Unsets the cap from the role. Then the option will be saved to the

O italian forum we are cotinously questions about how to have a
wp_list_cats show only some categories, but not using exclude but how
to include the desired categories.

If you have 30 cats and you wanna have a page that show some cats (2
or 3) another page with soem other cats etc using the exclude
parameters is not so usefull particualry if the categorises changes
and some new were added ina  second time.

Havng a include option for this tag would be nice, wouldn't be ?

Can I suggest a Dev Blog post today that will kill this security crap in

I don't think ignoring this stuff is the best approach.

And the average user who happens to hear about a vulnerabilty posted
on secunia, who has a history of posting serious threats, now thinks
that their install is vulnerable, and now we have countless people
coming on IRC and the forums wondering when there will be a security
upgrade.

All Podz wants is a post people will see in their dash's, and on the planet.
We know it's hokey, we know it's pure BS, but how many of them read this
list?
People need warm and fuzzy re-assurance with an overview of a few
reasons why, not a full documented/detailed response.

Ignoring it means that all of the chicken littles will continue to squawk
about the end of the world and silence from the devs will be interpreted as
either colusion or a  behind-the-scenes cover-up  that the devs are secretly
working on to fix without admitting there is a problem.

Do you think I ask for this because I'm bored and can't think of
anything else to do on a Thursday? Do you realise how incredibly
annoying this is when we have to continually defend WordPress? Do you
realise how many times this has happened before and that we KNOW a post
by Matt shuts them all up? No? Right, trust me okay?

I'll be honest though - if it wasn't for the dashboard I think something
may well have been posted.

There is also a negative impact when one posts an item titled "Don't worry,
WordPress is safe". It shows doubt. If Mark fears is concerned the privacy
of his poison (plug-ins), then he should toss a blank index in the plug-ins
directory. If you accept his argument and post clarifications about this
so-called 'vulnerability', what will be next?

People could start a commotion over other aspects which are consiered more
serious 'vulnerabilities'. Users could argue about serious matters like the
reluctance to lock WordPress after a particular number of failed logins
(still?) or the disclusion of 'out of the box' DDOS attack protection.

The vulnerabilities published are much worse than this, and of all
this needs the least clarification. What needs clarification is that
there is no XSS, nobody can remotely take down your blog or change
your pages, potentially steal your login information with malicious
javascript, etc.

DDOS protection comes at a level much earlier than WordPress, and in
order for WordPress itself to know that it may be coming under DDOS,
WordPress has to store additional data in the database or on the
filesystem. Each write is more harmful than the last, and really
trying to stop DDOS attacks is opening yourself up to more.

DDOS at this level is targetting the hardware and the underlying
components of a website, the HTTP server, the network stack, the
bandwidth limits of your PCI buses, not the software, and anyone who
argues that WordPress needs builtin DDOS protection is a fool imho.

In the spanish speakers community, started linking this "XSS", and
making a little bad publicity to the project, as for myself, I just
discovered this posts on many blogs, and started explaining that there
isnt any threat on this. But well, we really need to put this on the the
dev blog.

+1

I think that during this, every list tags should be reviewd and soem
hve to be harmonized, for example having a dropdonwn_archive that
generates the dropdown ad dropdown_cats would be nice too, sme for
links, harmonizing all the "list" tags it's a big and hard job but
having a more harmonized structures between various tag would be nice
woldn't be ?

gentlemen,

denial of service attacks or distributed ones have different methods but DO
NOT aim a software blog (like wordpress).
a software blog is not responsible for a thing which most expensive hardware
firewalls cant handle (we are talking about a difference of 5 osi layers).
so i totally stick with the answer of mr deaton.

nimrod

I'm sorry, didn't want to sound rude and I really appreciate what you 
are doing for Wordpress. I just didn't _see_ the full extend of this 
little incident. People who don't know better - most of them - really 
freak out fast if some high instance speaks of vulnerabilities in their 
favorite piece of software.

And I agree. One word from Matt would be really helpful now. People 
start not believing me it's safe, even if I let them execute the posted 
exploit on their own blog :-) ... maybe they believe Matt :-)

Greetings

I'm doing just that in svn trunk.  Take a look at 
wp_dropdown_categories(), wp_list_categories(), wp_dropdown_pages(), and 
wp_list_pages().  I'm working on wp_list_bookmarks() right now.  I'm 
planning to harmonize the arguments passed to them while maintaining 
backwards compatibility with old arguments.

Also note that you can call these functions in two different ways now. 
You can use a query string:

wp_dropdown_categories('selected=34&hierarchical=1');

Or an associative array:

$args  = array('selected' => 34, 'hierarchical' => true);

wp_dropdown_categories($args);

Whichever you prefer. Sometimes the associative array is handy, 
especially when using compact().  Sometimes you just want to 
add_query_arg() onto a query string.

Help cleaning all of this up is appreciated, of course.  I'd like to get 
an updated 'only' patch for get_categories(), get_pages(), and 
get_bookmarks().  This stuff needs lots of testing too.

As for #2328, I think we can be even more comprehensive than that. 
Let's make our hooks wish list for these functions.

I don't think it's necessary to have lots of hooks, just one good hook in the right place.  As David
suggested, I'd like to see a filter on the actual array content, instead of just the
outputted text.  However, I argued that it would be more useful to have a filter before the
categories or pages are even fetched by WordPress, so that plugins can generate their own subset of
categories or posts according to more complex criteria without having to filter the full set of results.

Getting all categories then providing a filter means we have to unset those categories in the array
that we don't want.  This probably involves the plugin making its own db access, then unsetting each
element of the object array.  It would work, but it's not pretty.  Relying solely on 'exclusions' or
'only' means a plugin has to generate a long string of ids.  (Incidentally, in the exclusions logic,
would it be more efficient to use NOT IN(1,2,...) instead of AND cat_id <> 1 AND cat_id <> 2 ... ?
Not sure of the speed comparison).

This is a rough idea of what I'd like to see, for example, in get_category(), where $r is the
supplied args merged with defaults:

// Takes arguments and returns an OBJECT array of category data.
$categories = do_action('get_category', $r);

// WordPress retrieves the categories if the plugin didn't.
if (!$categories) $categories = $wpdb->get_results("...");

This can take place even before the 'exclusions' (and the presumed 'only') loop as long as the
plugin has access to the arguments and handles them.

Note that the check above is too simple and would have to include the possibility that the plugin
deliberately returned no categories.  This method avoids the need for multiple db accesses and also
allows plugins to do other things like alter the cat_name here, if they were able, instead of having
to update it later in list_cats.  Mainly, it gives access to the source of the data, the effects of
which will happen throughout the site and admin interface from only one plugin function.  Similar
functionality in pages and bookmarks would be great too.

Finally, for building a category or page list, it would good if the _page_dropdown_element etc
callback functions were pluggable so formatting could be controlled.  At the moment, access only to
the HTML, through the wp_list_pages filter is a bit clunky.

Cheers,

Jamie.

Dear all hackers and lurkers (I know you're out there),

With the growing frequency of topics that are frustrated with the way
WordPress is currently moving, especially this post from the forums
list ( http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-forums/2006-March/001532.html
), I'm growing curious as to how the hackers community as a whole
feels, so I'd like to throw up a little survey, and find out what some
people honestly think.

- How do you think the Development model of WordPress is now? What are
its strongpoints? What are its flaws? What do you think should be
changed and what should be left the same?
- What are your views on project's leadership? Are they steering us in
the right direction, or are we going downhill? Is community feedback
weighted enough with personal views of the developers? Are we
interacting with people outside the coding community enough to get a
fair view of what could be the best for everyone?
- Do we get too little, just the right amount, or too much feedback
from the developers on things discussed on this list and elsewhere? Do
you think this has a positive or negative impact on the project as a
whole?

I'll leave my views out of this message and answer my own questions
later in the thread.

greetings,

i'm more of a lurker, not a programmer or a web developer. :)

i think the WordPress platform would benefit if it were to undergo a 
security audit by an independent contractor like Gulf Tech Research 
and/or Netcraft - these folks have eyes that are trained differently 
(imho), unmatched experience & have tools that can point out weak points 
that can be exploited and overlooked - no, not to undermine the existing 
efforts being made. not necessarily a line-by-line code auditing like 
the OpenBSD project does.

also, I'm wondering if the project has plans to release patch files as 
an alternative to downloading entire packages just to get a bump from, 
say 2.0 to 2.0.1 - a simple patch -p0 -s < patchfile would really help 
speed up the process for those mainting 100s of WordPress blogs, like 
myself. why does WordPress have to include *new* features for revisions? 
why not just release something like 2.0.1 to address bug fixes, nothing 
more?

i also think the WordPress project should maintain both development & 
support channels, separately. and that more core developers & testing 
folks should be part of it, at least the ones that can make a genuine 
commitment, not just lip service.

in closing, i believe the WordPress codex is one of the best. props to 
all the contributors. :) Podz, looking forward to your planned 
contributions to Gallery 2 codex, another project I monitor.

That costs money.  Maybe Automattic can pay for that, I don't know, but 
it's not as if we've got a money printing press.  Regardless of hiring 
someone, a community security effort would be nice.  My one previous 
attempt to get something going fizzled and died.

Creating diffs between subversion branches is trivially easy.  I've 
always figured those who can apply patches would generate their own 
diffs.  Maybe we can supply diffs.  It's pretty cheap to do even for 
such a limited audience.

svn diff http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0/ 
http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.1/

We already have mailing lists for development and testing and forums for 
support.  Do you mean a support mailing list in addition to the forums?

I read the support forums every day.  I don't post very often, but I'm 
usually lurking about trying to judge the zeitgeist and seeing what 
things are being requested.

hi Ryan,

sorry, i meant, the IRC channels. thanks for the quick feedback, that 
cleared up a lot of questions I've been withholding since i started 
usingthe WordPress platform back in April 2004.

A dev IRC channel would be nice as long as we can keep it on topic.  I 
confess that I have to be in a certain mood to join #wordpress and 
listen to the rants.  Usually a bottle or two of wine gets me in the 
right frame of mind. ;-)

Maybe even three IRC channels.

#wordpress - Community chat, rag on the devs and their egomaniacal 
stupidity, discuss impending demise of WP, rant about politics, flirt, etc.

#wordpress-dev - Design and implementation of core WP and plugins.

#wordpress-help - Help users with problems and questions.

There was a time when #wordpress was the place for help.  Matt has
consistently steered people away from #wordpress because he wants
people to use the forums.  His rationale is legitimate, but Matt's
preferences do not coincide with everyone else's.

Matt consistently refuses to assign ops to anyone in #wordpress on a
regular basis in order to keep it on topic.

How many other projects have a general #project channel with a
separate #project-help channel?

Personally, I don't mind the way that #wordpress is for most help
right now. Generally speaking, when someone comes in for help, most
other people have learned to drop their conversation for a few minutes
while that person is being helped. There are, however, a number of
people who haven't gotten that yet, but then again, I suppose that its
not really a requirement, seeing as its "not a support channel" and
thus is not required to stay on topic or help at all, and I think that
if we changed direction a bit and enforced that rule somehow, we don't
need the segmentation of channels (but for the record, I know of just
one channel, #azureus, which has a -help/-support channel, but I do
know some channels who do the opposite, like #gentoo has
#gentoo-chat).

As for a -dev channel, no opposition to that here, would be nice to
have a channel to talk about little more than code, and it'd be pretty
neat if we could do similar to #madwifi with their bot that informs of
trac changesets and ticket changes (theirs does wiki changes too, but
we don't use the trac wiki for much of anything).

Okay, been looking at the cron code, as I had an idea for something I
wanted to write up and submit as a patch. However, I'm at a loss
looking at some of the code, and hopefully someone can tell me I'm an
idiot and slap me in the head with a stick. First off, I don't see
anywhere in the code where the hook would be fired, a function called,
or anything, I'm at a complete loss. Second, I'm 90% certain this is a
bug:

function wp_clear_scheduled_hook($hook) {
	while($timestamp = next_scheduled('scheduled_hook'))
		wp_unschedule_event($timestamp, 'scheduled_hook');
}

Shouldn't those 'scheduled_hook' strings actually be the $hook that's
being passed in? How would we unschedule an event like that, if
they're stored by an arbitrary hook name?

I don't even care if it is from different versions, I'd just be happy  
with the ability to import my two dead blogs into my current undead  
(semi-alive?) blog and move forward. Trying to do a manual combine  
stinks, especially since certain categories exist across blogs.

Oh, and I don't know if it is possible in 2.01, but I do find it  
annoying in 1.5.x that category names are globally unique. I do  
understand some of the reason for it, but I would really like the  
ability to create something like:

Work
	Code
	Design
	Hammer and Nails
Fun
	Code
	Design
	Comic Books

as a category structure

Looks like a bug to me.  Submit a bug and a patch that works for you if 
you have time, otherwise I'll get to it.

The cron stuff hasn't had a lot of use or testing.  If there is anything 
you need added, changed, or fixed, shout.

That sounds pretty cool.  We don't use the trac Wiki, but much of the 
development discussion these days happens in Trac ticket comments, 
especially now that we have the trac mailing list.  More of that 
discussion should be directed to the hackers list, but having the 
comments archived right there in the bug is handy.

I've actually noticed a positive change in the last 6-12 months.   
When we started the whole "Bug Gardeners" idea, it was mostly just  
Skippy and I using the "bg" namespaced tags to communicate with each  
other and with Ryan and Matt.  Recently, we've dropped the  
namespacing because the entire community has been getting more  
involved with Trac tickets, so the concept of "Bug Gardener" has  
become unnecessary... the workload has been distrubuted.  We now have  
a whole slew of people who are autonomously fixing bugs, submitting  
patches, and having them committed.  Although all patches still go  
through Matt and Ryan, it seems to me that they have become more  
willing to trust other people's patches.  The community has been  
doing a great job of auditing their own patches, so I think that  
helps take a lot of the burden off the main devs.  I've also noticed  
that Matt and Ryan seem to be putting more time into the project...  
the turnaround time for patches has improved greatly.

I think we're going in the right direction, for the most part.  To be  
honest, without Matt and Ryan acting as a reality check, a lot of  
"bridge burning" code would be going in (and coming out) of  
WordPress.  That might be fine for us PHP jockey types, but not for  
the general users of WordPress.  WordPress has a huge user base, and  
(perhaps unfortunately), that requires that we always be mindful of  
how our changes will affect existing users.  While I've always been  
open to a more authoritative role in development, I do not envy Matt  
or Ryan one bit for the decisions they have to make for the benefit  
of WP's userbase, against the wishes of the WP development  
community.  It's a thankless job, (and apparently one that's driving  
Ryan to the bottle!) :-D

The Trac mailing list is one of the best things to happen to  
WordPress in quite a while.  Seriously.  And Trac tickets have now  
become places for in-depth discussions of patches.  Trac tickets no  
longer feel like life rafts hoping that they'll run into a passing  
ship.  MichaelH and Ryan (Boren) had an amazing back-and-forth over  
the course of about 4 days with nearly 30 messages posted and 12  
patch revisions put up!

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2499

Bravo.

As you probably know, I'm not really one to rock the boat.  But I  
really am quite happy with the direction the project is taking...  
definitely happier than I was 12-18 months ago.

I'd like codify something I already do, or at leasty try to do. 
Sometimes I fall off the wagon during late night coding feasts when I 
can't get ahold of anyone.

Every commit must be accompanied by a ticket.  Before commit, the code 
needs to be reviewed by at least two people.  One person to do a regular 
code review and another to do an integration/architecture review.  These 
reviews should be logged to the ticket with a comment and "reviewed" 
"arch-reviewed" keywords (or something to that end).  This is similar to 
the Mozilla model.

http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/reviewers.html

I always try to get code reviews from one of our regular contributors.

http://wordpress.org/about/

And if it affects an area one of them has expertise in, I try to get an 
integration/architecture review.  I go to Andy for tinyMCE, JS, AJAX, 
and uploader stuff, for example.  Owen is good for capabilities, JS, 
AJAX, plugin API, cron, and just about anything, really.  David and Mark 
contribute all over the place and their approval always boost my 
confidence in a change.  i18n work from Nikolay always goes right in.

I think this would be facilitated by a #wordpress-dev channel where we 
could hang out and review bugs and keep conversation focused driving 
development.

I will agree wholeheartedly with this on the development model. Patch
turnaround time has improved greatly, wp-trac definately helps out as
prior to that list, keeping track of conversation on bugs required a
very loose trigger finger toward rss feeds or a lot of visiting back
to old bugs, which was really a pain in the rear. More people with
trac access has definately helped keep load down on Matt and Ryan
(what are we up to now, 4, 5 people? I have trac access, and I believe
that skippy, Mark, and David have access, did I miss anyone). And so
far the general consesus seems a -dev channel would be nice, so what's
stopping everyone? Join on up, I'll reliquish op status to Matt or
Ryan if/when they come about to register the channel (I'm sitting idle
there right now just so that Joe I-Register-Channels doesn't come
along and register it from under us).

Right now we have a funnel commit policy, and I, for the most part, am 
the end of the funnel.  This is mainly to avoid having such bridge 
burning arguments happen in the repository rather than in ticket 
comments.  But, we have several regular and trusted contributors now, 
many of whom I consider authoritative in certain areas of the code.  I 
wouldn't mind opening up commit access to them.  I know Matt and others 
like having a narrow funnel, even if not necessarily me, but I wouldn't 
mind broadening the funnel.

Every feature we've ever added and every decision we've made has been 
met with resistance, some of it hysterical and threatening.  I dread 
reading my email some days.

It's hard to know if you're doing the right thing.  Sometimes you have 
to go for it and be ready to correct mistakes once history shows you 
were wrong.  Now where did I set my glass of wine? :-)

That was exciting and definitely a high point.  I hope we can do more of 
that.  It will take discipline from those with commit access (me). 
Sometimes I work on something and want to push into the repository  so 
people can try it out, especially during the early alpha phase when 
we're experimenting and the code is flying.  I need contain my 
excitement and make sure others look things over first.

For what it's worth, I saw newsgroups threads that went along that theme
too. One matter is WordPress as-is and a separate issue is the upgrade.
It's the same scenario for usability and stability as it is a feature-wise
argument (alluding to 2.x in particular).

I know that you will disagree, but WordPress is managed by a collection of
heroes rather than involve a layered delegation of responsibilities. It
makes matters poorly-structured. Can you put together a mental image of
WordPress development, from a social perspective?

I happen to agree with many opinions voiced by the 'leadership'. I don't
think there is much place for improvement in that respect.

Feedback has a cost. I remember times when Matt spent much of his time just
catching up with E-mail, mailing lists, the blogsphere, forums and so
forth.

Message-ID: <C02FBD09.FC05%apakuni@gmail.com>

Initially, I thought the narrow commit funnel was a bad idea.  But having
worked on 2 major OSS CMS projects with wide-open commit policies, I have to
say I see the wisdom of the narrow funnel. Loose control leads to spaghetti
code and flame wars over inconsequential issues.

As for the comments on Matt's leadership in the linked post, I've never had
that experience.  Granted, I am not in the code the way Scott seems to be,
but Matt has always been gracious and available to me.   That said, if folks
are unwilling to write docs themselves, they need to be supportive of those
who are willing.  

Also, one of the great things about open source is ... if you think the
project is going in a direction you do not like, you are free to take the
code and, dare I say it, start a "fork" that you control.  Pissing on the
leg of the leadership is not likely to get you anything but ignored.

As for the the commercial interests at play, I disagree with the assertion
that they are hurting the project.  I personally do not like Askimet and the
whole wp.com key structure.  I've said so on this list.  However,
alternatives are readily available and disabling Askimet is as simple as
deleting it from my plugins directory.  If/when commercial tie-ins are
buried deep in the code and their removal cripples WP, then we have a
problem.  Until that day, the exposure and stability provided by the
underlying commercial enterprises hurt more than they help.

WP is very extensible and this is it's strength.  The core should always
remain lean and contain only essential and relevant core modules.  From
there, we can, and should, "roll our own" custom distros with all of our
favorite plugins in place.  And, if there is functionality which does not
exist but you think is critical, write it as a plug-in.  If it becomes
ubiquitous and everyone screams for it in the core (like back up) it will
find its way in there.

Finally, I'll agree that WP could benefit from an independent security
audit.  But I'll disagree with the idea that Matt and company need to pay
for it.  Their only obligation to pay is for the code that runs their
commercial businesses, and even then it is their call.

If the community wants an independent audit, we need to come out of pocket
to get it.  If someone wants to lead that effort, tell us how much it is,
set up a paypal or other account to pay for it and I will gladly donate.

As it is now, there is no way for a third party role manager plugin  
(like Owen's... is there another one?) to know about the capabilities  
that a plugin uses unless that plugin adds the capability to an  
existing role.

I can think of two solutions:

An easy way to add the plugin's capability to all roles with  
manage_options capability (which is, IMO, the best way to determine  
the most authoritative users on the WP install).  Then, the role  
manager plugin will display that capability and it can be added to  
other roles.

Or, create a new function that allows plugins to register their  
capabilities (in memory).  Then, a role manager plugin could merge  
capabilities defined in the database with default capabilities plus  
capabilities registered by plugins on the fly.

As it is, the plugin would have to have its own mini role management  
code, which seems wasteful to me.

Just curious, but why aren't plugins granting caps to the
administrator role as a matter of course? They'll be able to grant it
to themselves anyway, after all, and it seems like a good
policy/best-practice.

(And there's always $grant = false, so adding a cap to the role
doesn't have to mean granting it. )

That'd be pretty cool as a generic function -- let a plugin give all
roles with `manage_comments` the `ajax_delete_comment` cap, say. I'd
use it, though for the time being I'm satisfied with something like

	foreach ( array_keys($wp_roles->get_names()) as $role_name ) {
		$role =& get_role($role_name);
		if ( $role->has_cap('manage_options') ) {
			$role->add_cap('some_plugin_cap');
		}	
	}

I don't want more wordpress IRC channels.  I absolutely LOVE #wordpress.
It's not overly active, but there is almost always someone in there
talking/gauking/working/commenting/etc.

Oh, and it's not nearly as elitist as a lot of other freenode channels.

There is no reason to make more channels because:
1) Everything you're suggesting can (and has) been answered in #wordpress

2) If you're going to create these 'official' channels, you need bodies.
Bodies that are ready and willing to provide quality answers alllll day
to the best of their ability.
I really do respect Podz for doing what he does.  Podz, and all the
other hugely active members on the WP.org forums.
You *cannot* get that same thing on IRC.
That is, you cannot get this officially.  Peers and other users power
#wordpress, and they do a damn find job of it IMO.

3) IRC is not a good outlet for the resurgence of help questions.  What
is *is* good for is special cases when the flow of
information/discussion/questions will continue occurring for a period of
time.
i.e. something that is too fast for forums, too slow for a phone call.
IRC support is akin to AIM/Instant Messaging support.
Who does that, and who will do that? Surely you realize that more people
use instant messengers than IRC, IRC is 'too complicated' for some users.
Won't you OBVIOUSLY instead set up help channels on multiple IM networks
to help?
Or install a JAVA chat app (home-hosted, not an IRC client) into the
website? Have at least one operator 'available' to answer questions all
day out of the kindness of their heart?

I am whole heartedly against multiple channels. Time and time again they
fail under other projects ( #phpbb had a #phpbbchat channel, *poof* it
went ) that don't merit the kind of fragmentation and split channels.
Multiple channels is good for huge things like Gentoo/Operating Systems
where there are literally TONS of fine grained topics that lumping them
into one single channel would be chaos.

Wordpress does not have anything remotely close to this.

Long story short:
[User] has joined #wordpress-dev
<User> Can anyone tell me how to make my own theme?
*10 minutes later*
[User] has joined #wordpress

Why not just cut the crap and let things go the way they already do?

I am against IRC as official support
I am against multiple channel for unique wp topics

[/soapbox]

P.S. I'm now looking forward to seeing ML stats for March 2006 :-).

Oh, and by the way.
I am, however, all for an SVN commit bot, trac ticket announcements and
such.
So, more or less, just a trac changeset announcer bot.
It would be the 'second' announcerbot, however, the first being wpbot
(once known as infobot) and heralding users onjoin.

In my Role Manager, I have added a hook that allows plugins to register 
their own caps for application to roles and users.  This is from the 
Role Manager documentation (http://redalt.com/wiki/Role+Manager):

add_filter('capabilities_list', 'add_my_caps');
function add_my_caps($caps) {
$caps[] = 'my_custom_cap1';
$caps[] = 'my_custom_cap2';
return $caps;
}

If the core were to do this, it would need to fill the caps list with 
all of the built-in caps.

It would be nice if the core could have a function to return an array  
of all hooks (default + extra ones registered by plugins).  Your  
plugin may be the only one now that provides role management  
capability, but that might not be the case in the future.  There  
should be a way for plugins to register their capabilities so that  
whatever role manager is being used can access them.  I'm fine with  
taking the option_name and hook that you're using and moving them  
into core.

Because there is no guarantee that an "administrator" role exists. 
Determining which role functions in an administrative capacity can be 
problematic.

Granting caps automatically sounds like a bad idea to me.  Logically 
speaking, why have a new capability at all, if you're going to grant the 
cap to only those roles that already have manage_options?

Well, it could be used as a "starting point" so that the capability  
could be delivered to "lesser" users.   Having a method in the core  
for registering capabilities would be much better, of course.

Mark Jaquith and I discussed this last night on #wordpress-dev and
thought it might be nice to assign some special status to
administrator (or possibly have some hidden role, 'superrole', 'root'
or something) that acts as a sink for all possible caps, along with a
get_superrole() function. This would make it nice and easy to tell
which caps are available, and might allow easier administration if
special privs are needed.

On the other hand, that might be overkill if we allow some method of
registering caps without tying them down to a specific role.

Actually, now I think about it, it doesn't make any sense to have a
cap which isn't tied to a role. If plugins don't want any existing
roles to have their cap, just create a new role and assign the cap to
that. Then Role Manager picks up that cap (if I remember the code
correctly). Or am I missing something?

I think I've changed my mind on this. :-)

Precisely why I changed my mind.

I think it makes less sense to presume to guess which roles a the WP  
operator wants to have this new capability.

Should work, but it seems silly to create a role only as a container  
of a capability.  Why not just create a mechanism by which plugin  
authors can register their capability, and then let people add that  
capability to an existing role?

In the plugin, you could do something like register_cap 
('some_cool_thing'); register_cap() would look at an existing array  
in the options table (a namespaced option, just like the one that  
holds roles) and if it doesn't exist, it adds it.  Then there could  
be a function like get_all_caps() that would return an array of all  
the default WP capabilities, plus all capabilities stored in that  
option.

If we used the same option that Owen is using now, we could probably  
even rig it so that older versions of his plugin would continue to work.

And because there'd be a universal method of adding/getting  
capabilities, plugin authors could just use current_user_can 
('my_cap') for their logic checks, and then in their installation  
instructions say "Add the "my_cap" capability to the users or roles  
to want to be able to use this plugin" and they could link to a codex  
page that has a list of role manager plugins.

How's that sound?

It's still a possbility that the plugin would create a role to
represent people that should be allowed into the functionality that
plugin provides. The admin would then assign specific users that role
(remember users can have multiple roles).

But I still prefer some register_cap() func, for flexibility's sake.
In the end, going with that previous method is just going to result in
a lot of almost-pointless roles.

+1.

I tried responding to each question individually but I ended up just
writing a bitty essay, so here's my general feelings.

What we've got:
* A large community with a lot of good ideas and the skills to implement them
* A lot of people willing to give up their time to code, testing, docs
and support.
* A decent product that hundreds of thousands of people use

Where the flaws are:
* Matt's low participation in WP discussion.
* Lack of vision/long-term roadmap
* No release schedule

To expand in order:

Matt's commits are few and far between, to put it lightly. We also
don't see many of his words on hackers, and he has confessed he
doesn't read many of the threads. Yes, I know, he's a busy man, he
gets X amounts of emails per day. So perhaps its time he took a step
back from the development scene and became the project's
publicist/leader instead. He'd do a great job as the latter, being
tuned into the current blogging zeitgeist and getting invitations to
all kind of fancy conferences.

---

Skippy was totally right when he said we need a vision. I'm apparently
one of the "contributing developers" and I haven't seen any kind of
plan for 2.next (I presume the devs have now read through the various
2.next threads and decided what we want in it).

In terms of long-term mission, we have Matt's explanation of the
WordPress mission statement:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-April/000765.html.
But that doesn't hold up to much scrutiny:

"You say you focus on web standards to produce something unique, but
how does coding in XHTML make your software any different from the
hundreds of other modern blog systems?". All the other buzzwords
dropped in that email don't seem to bear any relevance on day-to-day
discussion on the lists. When was the last time we said "ah, no, lets
not do that, that's not very semantic"? We say we're focusing on web
standards but things like Atom 1.0 recieve little attention.

---

We still have no kind of formal short- and medium-term roadmap. People
say stuff like "2.02 is coming soon" with no indication of when that
will be. Are the due dates on trac's Milestones set in stone? For
example, there's a due date of the 7th (Tuesday) for 2.02. Will we
stick to that? If not, when is it? This applies to major releases more
than minor ones. Can we set up some kind of timetable like the
following?

- Major release
- Subsequent security releases if applicable
- 1 month's debugging
- Minor bug-fixing release
- Subsequent security releases if applicable
- 4-6 months' development
- 1 month's testing
- Final RC for plugin authors
- ~ 1 week, 10 days
- Major release

Then rinse and repeat. This is a 6-8 month timetable, which I think
sounds reasonable. People have been supportive of this in the past, I
feel it would relieve some of the tension around major releases.

(This is kind of unrelated, but didn't really fit in anywhere else.)
I'd also like to get some kind of formal review on tickets for
bg|commit status. As I see it we need five bug levels: 1) new 2)
confirmed 3) fix available 4) fix confirmed 5) commit. We'd move 1 ->
2 when someone can replicate, 2 -> 3 when someone posts a preliminary
patch, 3 -> 4 when someone confirms the patch works, and finally a bug
gardener or someone with similar seniority (e.g. a committor) would
move 4 -> 5 if the posted patch looks like a _good_ solution.

---

Finally, I'd like to add a couple of words regarding a recent success
the community has had. Speaking as a code-wrangler, I have to say I've
been encouraged by the last few weeks of activity. Ryan seems to have
put a lot of time into committing and coding, removing the committing
bottleneck. I've also been encouraged by attempts to improve WP's
quality of code, like http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2525.

Current opinion: we're improving.

development are mostly "on the same page".

> What are its flaws? 

There is no publicly defined vision.  There is no documented roadmap.
The "same page" used by the developers is not shared with anyone else in
a meaningful way.

Short of bug fixing, it's not clear how new people can meaningfully
contribute.

Contributions from new (or unprivileged) participants are often rejected
without any kind of positive reinforcement to encourage future
participation.

This has long been a problem.  Way back in the 1.0 days, I submitted an
ugly patch directly to Matt to provide per-user posting level support
(like the view levels plugin now).  Rather than say "Thanks", or
encourage me to rework the patch, Matt's word were, quote, "Does it have
to be so complicated?".  That was my first attempt to really contribute
to the core code, and it was rejected out of hand.  I should have
stopped participating right there, in truth.

My second real attempt to contribute found me working with Ryan.  He
pointed out to me specifically where I needed to pay attention to stuff
in the get_next_post() and get_previous_post() functions.  My patch
evolved, with Ryan's encouragement, and was added to the core.

A lot of people are using Trac, and a lot of things are being marked
"wontfix" with only terse explanations.  That's not helpful to the
original reporter: they took the time to file a ticket on something that
was important to them.  Curt rejections do not encourage participation.

> What do you think should be changed and what should be left the same?

I'm not entirely sure about what suggestions I could make; but I'm
pretty well sure than any suggestions I provide will be dismissed or
diminished.  My views are clearly in the minority.

> - What are your views on project's leadership? 

I think there's not much leadership.  I think there's an autocracy,
whereby one person (Matt) makes the bulk of the policy decisions.  Matt
doesn't inspire participation.  He doesn't participate much on the
mailing lists, when people are struggling with things that specifically
need "official" response (see Robert Deaton's plea to squash the
security rumors); but he has plenty of time to let us know he's going to
hand out tee shirts at conferences.

When disagreements arise, it seems to me that Matt's side usually wins.
 I don't recall (m)any examples of Matt conceding an issue.  I have not
the time to read through all my archives to determine whether this
impression is accurate.

Leadership implies vision, which further implies being proactive, or
ahead of the trends.  I don't think there's any doubt that Matt has
technical leadership, but as a _project_ leader I think he's extremely
deficient.  He was opposed to the implementation of a bug tracker
originally.  He failed to appoint anyone to tend to the bug tracker
until it became full of stale tickets.  There's not been much
_proactive_ leadership for the non-technical, mundane day-to-day aspects
of the WordPress project, and it is from that that much of my complaints
arise.

> Are they steering us in the right direction, or are we going downhill? 

The leadership is steering us in the direction they wish to go, which is
not clearly defined or documented.

> Is community feedback weighted enough with personal views of the developers? 

In my opinion, no; but then I've consistently been on the losing side of
every argument on this mailing list.  I suspect that people who are on
the winning side feel differently.

> Are we interacting with people outside the coding community enough to get a
> fair view of what could be the best for everyone?

I've no idea.

> - Do we get too little, just the right amount, or too much feedback
> from the developers on things discussed on this list and elsewhere? 

I think most technical issues have reasonable discussion with Ryan,
Andy, and a few blessed outsiders (Mark, Owen).  On the whole, the level
of information sharing has increased in the recent months, with a marked
decline in the number of things that are being added without the
introduction of a corresponding trac ticket first.

Administrative issues vary wildly.

Matt's participation in the mailing lists these days has been mixed.
It's my perception that he refrains from giving definitive answers,
which oftens creates even more consternation in the midst of an on-going
discussion looking for leadership.

> Do you think this has a positive or negative impact on the project as a
> whole?

I'm clearly in the minority in thinking that much of the above hurts the
project.  I'm discouraged from participating further, and likely will
make no efforts to do so.

In terms of new features?  Yes.  Mostly because these are the people  
coding them and submitting them, or suggesting them on wp-hackers.   
See: Andy's work on TinyMCE/JS, and Owen's work on the Role/Cap  
system.  In terms of bugfixing, that's more likely to come from  
diverse sources.

This is very obviously a bad thing, and something I'll be looking for  
on Trac.

I agree.  I always try to give a meaningful reason, but have probably  
failed to explain thoroughly enough in some instances.  What might  
seem like a reasonable explanation to me might seem like a brush-off  
by the person who submitted the ticket.  Again, something I'll work on.

WP would definitely benefit from more active involvement by Matt, but  
absent that (he seems to be very busy with many different projects)  
it would be good to see a little more authority delegation.  It might  
be nice to have someone in charge of PR.  For example, that person  
could have communicated with Owen, Robert and me about the recent XSS  
report that turned out to be bogus.  We could have told him/her that  
it was bogus.  Podz could have told him/her that people were bringing  
it up on the forums, rattling the gates asking for a patch.  The PR  
person could have then worked with Podz and the forum crew and the  
code jockeys to write a post for the wp.org blog, and it could have  
been posted.  That could have been accomplished in 12-48 hours, easily.

Now, I very much understand the need for "funnels"... and I'm not  
suggesting that we make WordPress into a democracy.  That would be  
chaos.  But as it is, we have only two funnels for commit access, and  
one funnel for PR-related issues (wp.org announcements, etc).  When  
Matt is away at SXSW or is otherwise occupied, we're down to one  
commit funnel, and a complete block on the PR front.  So I'm not  
suggesting that the "funnel" idea is flawed... we just need a few  
more funnels so we don't get clogs! :-D

Definitely an area where improvements have been made.  But I don't  
think this is an exclusive club ("a few blessed outsiders").  Anyone  
can get a forum account and comment on Trac tickets, or participate  
in wp-hackers discussions.  Hopefully the new Trac mailing list will  
make it easier for people to get involved with these discussions.   
It's certainly helped me.

While I may disagree as to the severity of the problems you've  
outlined, I don't dismiss them outright.  I've been (albeit gently)  
pushing for more openness and more delegation of authority as well.   
I think it's getting better, generally, but there is still much  
progress to be made.  I'm very sorry that you feel discouraged from  
participation.  Your efforts will definitely be missed.  If nothing  
else, I hope that your departure will serve as motivation for more  
openness and inclusion in the future.

It really is a shame to see you (or anyone) leave over this. While
I've often shared much of your frustration, with this thread I decided
I want to reboot mentally, flush everything out, and give the whole WP
thing a fresh start (as I think at this point everyone has a pretty
low image of me cause of some of the fussing I've done in the past,
I'd like to correct that). I very much hope that with this thread, we
can pick out the strong and weak points of the community, highlight
the strong points, and fix the weak points, so that everything comes
together better than before.

Addendum:

To touch on a related issue, how come no girls in mailing lists and devel-
opment? The forums are the only exception I can think of. Ever since Kitty
left in anger last year, this has been something which is difficult to ig-
nore.  As controversial and idiotic as it may sound, the presence of girls
could motivate any community which is largely occupied by and appraised by
guys. It's truly something to ponder.

Scott,

My earlier email was largely a response to your post which Robert linked to.
The first post read as knee-jerk frustration.  Your current post is much
more pointed and much less passionate ... both are good things.  In short, I
get where you are coming from and no longer see it as an angry rant.

This has me thinking.

What prevents the community from doing a "rebuild" project.  For those
unfamiliar with the idea, check out CentOS.org.  CentOS is an open source
rebuild of the Red Hat Enterprise License.  The dynamics would be a little
different.  CentOS is a "free" competitor to RHEL, but is essentially the
same code, repackaged a little bit differently.  With this in mind, let me
float the idea for WordPress "Community Edition" (WPCE).

WPCE would have it's own SVN trunk and independent project managers. The
group would set their own vision for WPCE and post it publicly.  They would
always work against the latest stable release of WP and build new
functionality into plug-ins whenever possible.  New functionality which
requires core changes would be written in a modular, OOP fashion to reduce
overall impact to the "Matt/Ryan" trunk.  Changes to core DB tables would be
kept to a minimum, unless adding new tables all together.  Again, this is a
modular approach.  If the community wants to raise funds to pay for a
security audit, we do it on the base "Matt/Ryan" trunk before we begin other
work.

The idea is not a fork.  Rather it is parallel development free of the
funnel approach which has some folks feeling slighted or restricted.  If
project leads from the WP and WPCE remain on friendly terms, then WPCE
becomes a skunkworks or proving grounds for the core product.  The WPCE
vision/roadmap is sure to be read by the core team.  Perhaps it will inspire
more formal planning from them.  As features are added and tested at WPCE,
demand for them will surely be driven back to the WP team.  And, once proven
in WPCE, the new feature is very likely to get a warm reception in WP.

To be clear, I am fine with the way things work now.  But, I hear your
concerns and think they are very valid.  And having lived through this with
both Postnuke and Xaraya, I am trying to offer a solution before this thing
turns into car wreck and I have to watch another great open source project
divide it's energy inappropriately and cause the overall project to stumble,
fall and perhaps never rise again.

If folks do not think that is possible in WP.  Think again.

If you think WPCE cannot work, think about Firefox and Mozilla.  Yes, the
Mozilla browser "died" but that was just a branding issue.  We'd do the same
thing, but move all of the changes into WP over time.

The keys to the WPCE concept are:

1) Both project teams remain on friendly terms, follow one another's
progress and support/respect one another.

2) Both work on a common core, with WPCE coding in a way that makes grafting
their work back into WP a simple thing to do.

So, chew on that idea for a while and tell me what you think. :D  If folks
are interested, I will certainly participate.

Thanks,  

Doug

It's not our fault. We're not actively discriminating against women,
they're just aren't any around.

This essay on the formal and informal structure of groups, orginally
targeting the
women?s liberation movement, is I think a must read for every open
source project, dev , leader:
http://www.bopsecrets.org/CF/structurelessness.htm


Even though I am not a core contributer, a few points I missed while
following the WP project.

- transparency of and participation in the decision process
- active PR. This recent XSS hole incident has been handled very poorly
and I guess a lot of trust
in the security of wordpress has been lost with the not so savvy
(potentional) users

(OT)
- the new design and layout of the forum/codex is a big step backwards
in terms of usability.
- useless, broken search on wordpress.org

Regarding the lack of money. Why is there no donate button on wordpress.org?

It's not about leadership, it's about management - and there is none.

Pre-2.0 I was asked what WordPress needed and I replied "A project
manager". I would repeat that again.
No-one has a good overview of the situation and even those who do read
all the lists and the forums while we might think we have a good view we
do not because we all have our own agendas. Certain coders said 2.0 was
ready for release, others did not, docs were not ready said some,
support was not ready, testing was not complete. But it happened. And
somehow it all hung together. That cycle will be repeated and repeated
because the decision to let the code free is in the hands of 2 or 3
people at most.

With all the glory of 'being WordPress' comes all the responsibility
too. I certainly think that responsibility needs to be collectively
shared - it is not now.

WP needs a manager. Someone who can be objective, who can pull all the
parts into shape and move each part forward or in the direction needed
to make WP into whatever it will be. It needs a manager who knows how to
manage. It needs someone who is nothing to do with WP to get in and do
whatever is needed. I think that were this to happen it would initially
be painful for some but the benefit would far outweigh such disruption.
And if no-one is appointed to manage ? That either means that there is
nothing or that current methods of work are approved of.

Whoever contributes code and ideas drives development.  Many people 
shape the development of WP.

I think it is good to share a philosophy.

Well, in large part the next release consists of whatever ideas people 
come up with along the way.  We try them on and see what sticks.

Just do it.  Really.  Scratch an itch.  People who wait to be told what 
to do aren't contributing.

Well, I'm not their mommy.  I tell people what is good and bad with 
their patch, and the people who really want to contribute will work with 
me and come back with another patch.  People who pitch a fit if I don't 
accept their patch wholesale are difficult to work with and not worth 
the time it takes to coddle them.  So, it goes both ways.

He says the same thing to me all the time.  ;-)  It's his primary job 
and a necessary one.

Thanks.  I do try.

We need to do better, but there needs to be some balance.  Some people 
expect huge discussion over why their pet idea was rejected.  That pet 
idea is usually one that has been suggested dozens of times before and 
everyone is tired of seeing it.

A security announcement is forth coming.  A lot goes on behind the 
scenes that sometimes delays "official" response.

They are not "blessed".  They are simply the people who do the work. 
How does one become a dev?  You fix bugs and write code.

Dear Friends,

I just want to know , excluding wordpress.com which I know is served by more
than 4 servers, What are the most successful samples of huge wordpress blogs
which are served on a shared server? Both huge from DB size and from
visitors per day?

But any response is better than no response. Even if it isn't an 
"official" response yet to the community, acknowledgment of the 
issue/problem/concern is courtesy.

I understand its hard to keep up with life, work, email, etc. but when 
issues like security come up, some sort of acknowledgment is in line.

Assuming you're referring to ESR's essay, WordPress is completely a 
bazaar model of development because all code is developed over the 
internet in view of the public.

I'm such a big believer in this model, that even in cases where 
functionality is developed for a specific purpose and not the core, the 
team takes the time to generalize the efforts into something that can 
benefit all WP users, like the Secure Admin plugin Ryan developed:

http://svn.wp-plugins.org/secure-admin/trunk/secure-admin.php

1.6/2.0 had a roadmap from the very beginning on the Codex. None of us 
are clairavoyent though, priorities change over time based on feedback 
from the community and also on what people are willing to work on.

(Examples: The media framework floundered until Andy took it by the 
horns. XML import/export.)

I'm sorry that two years ago I didn't give your patch the proper feedback.

To be fair, that is generally my chief objection to most code that is 
submitted, and I say it just as often to Andy or Ryan as anybody.

Your opinions have not, and will not, be diminished simply by having 
your name associated with them. I'm not sure what gave you this idea in 
the first place

I certainly could participate more on mailing lists, but I don't want to 
smother discussion. Some people assume me disagreeing with something is 
an outright dismissal rather than an invitation to further justification 
for an idea.

*If something needs a direct response from me, please send me a direct 
email.*

There is a lot going on and things that take up a ton of my time that 
might not be manifested in mailing list posts or public commits. That's 
okay, I'm not interested in putting my name one everything and the fact 
that everything isn't being done by me anymore is a sign of maturity of 
the project.

I'm not going to apologize for spending hundreds of dollars to hand out 
free shirts at a WordPress meetup. I was also planning on sending some 
to frequent contributors once we have shipping set up, feel free to 
opt-out. It's just something I'm doing to say "thank you."

Huh? This is not true.

There were people with admin privileges on Trac before we created the 
"bug gardener" title for it.

I don't think we'll ever make everyone happy, but I think this 
discussion is important to have.

I would say that I have seen people, particularly in the IRC channel, 
say and act in ways that I think would discourage active female 
participation. However this is not behaviour specific to WP, it's more 
endemic to male geek communities.

I'm sure any women on this list could speak to challenges they've faced, 
and perhaps that would make people more sensitive in the future.

There was an highly-cited article in the Boston Globe a couple of months
ago.

Thanx Steve :)

 Can anyone introduce some one user usage of wordpress on a shared server
which has a big DB or receives so many hits a day?

Description

Patrik Karlsson reported that WordPress 1.5.2 makes use of an
insufficiently filtered User Agent string in SQL queries related to
comments posting. This vulnerability was already fixed in the 2.0-series
of WordPress.

Impact

An attacker could send a comment with a malicious User Agent parameter,
resulting in SQL injection and potentially in the subversion of the
WordPress database. This vulnerability wouldn't affect WordPress sites
which do not allow comments or which require that comments go through a
moderator.

Reported in the forums:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/63734?replies=3#post-339189

There are a lot of people still using 1.5.2
Can this be patched so an upgrade does not have to be the response ?

An announcement is also called for surely ?

I contacted wordpress through their security@wordpress.org e-mail 
address the 6th of February but haven't heard anything. I sent a new 
mail today. I guess they don't care about vulnerabilities in their older 
versions. I don't know how many other distributions still ship with 1.5.2.

Don't bother. 2.02 will be out within hours.

Which is to say that 2.01 has vulnerabilities, for those that don't read

Unless I'm missing something, it seems even in the latest nightly one
is forced to use the old user-level syntax when adding menus to the
admin control panel and using functions like add_menu_page,
add_options_page, etc.

Wouldn't it be better if we could pass a role or capability--instead
of just an access_level--as an argument to functions like
add_menu_page?  That way all and only those that have, say,
"forum_moderator" capability could access their own menus,
independently of their overall WP roles.

You can pass a capability in that parameter.  The Codex docs on the 
function are out of date.

WordPress handles numeric values passed for that parameter like it 
handles all numeric $user->has_cap(X) calls, by verifying that the user 
has a "level_X" capability.  That's why it still works.

+1 from me.

Have you visited #qmail, #fedora or even #sendmail? I have. I tell ya,
trained by the chatter in #wordpress --- and the helpful people in
wordpress -- I visit them regularily when I'm stumped. But the responses
I get sound like crickets 75% of the time.

I'd vote to keep #wordpress and ignore #wp-dev or whatever. But then I
go to other departments' staff meetings to get a cross section of what
the company's doing anyway (really insightful if you're in IT and other
departments are struggling with things that are easily solved with IT).

I meant to update my live blog to WordPress v2.0.2 RC, but being the

now it's running v2.1-alpha. *sigh*

Since I take it there's no easy way to downgrade and I don't want to 
loose the changes I've made since I last backed up (yeah, I didn't 
backup my database before doing it either *cries*), what should I know 
about v2.1?

I see that the links now use the main categories. What's with that? 
Links are treated as posts now? Or..

And yeah, I know it's my own damn fault, but a mini-readme would be 
appreciated as I haven't been paying attention to the trac as of late.

Thanks much, guys.

There's a discussion on the forums right now about how best to
handle the increasing use of option pages by plugins, which is
beginning to crowd the sub menus for some:

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/63824

I've previously brought up the suggestion Matt Read makes in that
thread, which is to provide a *master* plugin options page plugin
devs can hook into when only one-two settings are needed. However,
I'm wondering if a better alternative would be to add a mechanism
where a plugin's options is linked from its entry under Plugins.

Thoughts?

There is some talk of moving some core items under "Manage" up a  
level, which would free up more room on that Submenu.

I think that relegating plugin options to a special plugin menu is  
unintuitive.  For example, see where Akismet's menu item is located.   
The beauty of WordPress is that it can be so drastically altered or  
enhanced with plugins.  Plugin menus should be in natual places.  The  
vast majority should be under Options or Manage.  If you're changing  
the way the plugin functions, changing its settings, it should go  
under Options.  If you're manipulating data in some way, it should go  
under Manage.  A user shouldn't have to think "hm, is this core or  
additional functionality?" when using the menu system.

I think that the Plugins submenu should be restricted to things  
having to do with plugin management... like editing, activating,  
downloading, upgrading etc.

And why not giving plugin developers the option of a hook, to add
themselfs to the already subpages on the Options menu, like Reading 
(there i will  put the gravatar options at the bottom), or WP-Cache to
go to Reading.


Maybe on plugins handling data like WP-Backup, having is on subpage
under manage, is a good location, but for options, it could be added to
the already and logical options sub-pages.

Why not to adda  second line submenu devoted only to plugins? This way
the second level menu for WP function wont' get messed up by to many
plugins options and it will be clear at firt look what are the menu
entry  related to WP and what the ones related to plugins.

This solution allow plugins put theyr menu under the right section
without cluttering the WP menu allowing in future adding more option
without subtracting space to plugins entries.

Coming upon this thread somewhat late, and seeing that it's got a
boatload of responses, I'm going to reply to your survey before I read
the whole thread. You know, to be unbiased and stuff. :-)

> - How do you think the Development model of WordPress is now? What are

The strong point is that the code is good, mostly, and that good
thinking has gone into the modular/plugin nature of its design.

Flaws? Well, I find that the community to be deeply frustrating. The
"one chief, many indians" nature of the community leads to a bit of a
monoculture with regard to decisions. Folks seem terrified that they're
going to say or do something that Matt disagrees with. Whether he is
entirely responsible for that state of affairs, I really can't say,
having only been around for about a year.

I see repeatedly good ideas surface, with people tentatively supporting
them, while actively supporting them on IRC, but then back off when Matt
suggests that he's not behind it. That sort of single-personality
management leads to a lack of new ideas, and, perhaps as concerningly,
leads eventually to a project where nobody wants to contribute anymore,
because they're sure that new ideas are unwelcome.

Perhaps I'm overstating. I can only speak from my own observations, and
from what I hear in the remarks of other folks.

No, we're absolutely not interacting enough with people outside of the
teeny coding community. There's a sense that they're not likely to know
what they want, and that their ideas are probably not particularly valuable.

This isn't to say that the leadership doesn't have good ideas. They
certainly seem to. But they also tend to disregard ideas from external
sources, with a really bad case of Not Invented Here.

What I see, as outlined above, is that the feedback from the developers
tends to shut down interesting conversations. I'll pick on the recent
inline docs conversation, because it's interesting to me. There was
overwhelming response and support for the idea. Then The Developers
pitched in their $0.02, saying, to summarize, that it's not a good idea.
And folks seem unwilling to disagree, because, as they are more willing
to say offline, there's really no point. If The Developers disagree,
then there's little value in continuing the conversation.

I've been involved in the Apache Software Foundation since almost the
beginning. We have a simple principle. It is stated thus:

Community > Code

ie, the Community is more valuable than the Code. The code can be
rewritten. The community is our only real asset. If you piss off the
community, eventually you have no more code.

This certainly isn't the only model. The FSF tends to see the world the
other way around, and it seems to work ok for them. But it's not nearly
as much fun. The ASF has much better parties.

Hi Guys,

Wonder if you could help me with a little problem ive stumbled apon, im 
writing a new plugin for a Private Messaging System.

Take a look at the code here - http://pastecode.net/?action=viewpost&tag=720

As you can see theres nothing happening apart from running a check to 
see if the user is logged in. For some unknown reason 
|is_user_logged_in() |refuses to run within the plugin class.

Is there any reason for this? i guess im missing something stupidly simple.

"Matt's preferences do not coincide with everyone else's." This seems to
be a common theme. What I find fascinating about this theme is that the
response seems to be consistently "therefore Matt is right, because it's
Matt's project." My view of Open Source is that it's not any one
person's project, and that the community is always right. But, as I
mentioned earlier, this is a specific view of Open Source that not
everyone agrees with.

It's never been clear to me what "on topic" might mean. If we can't talk
about wordpress support issues, then what does that leave?

Personally, I find web-based support forums cumbersome and hard to use.
And I'm *far* less likely to help on one, simply because I forget to
check it regularly enough. On IRC or email lists, I'm likely to answer
questions immediately. Having multiple support forums is only goodness.

> How many other projects have a general #project channel with a

Several do, and it's irritating. The #project channel consists of:
<newbie> I have a question about my grommit
<oldie> Go to #project-support

.. then, on #project-support

<newbie> I have a question about my grommit
<oldie> I'd *love* to help you with that.

Yeah. That saved time.

is_user_logged_in() is a pluggable function, so your class's
constructor is run before it gets defined.

"plugins_loaded" is the first action after all plugins are loaded and 
pluggable functions have been loaded so you could hook onto that.

I agree with this, but I also know that there are some plugins that have 
a single setting (an update URL, an image URL, a snippet of text, etc.) 
that makes having a whole submenu page somewhat overkill.

I've taken to doing really crazy things to get around this, like adding 
an extra link to the plugins page under the "Deactivate" link that says 
"Configure".  When you click this link, the plugin displays a 
configuration form.  (My plugins use Ajax to display the form in-place, 
but it will fallback to using a regular panel like I describe below.)

It might be beneficial to include a hook in the Action column on the 
Plugin activation page that allows plugin authors to easily add a link 
to a configuration page.  If added in this way, the link could point to 
any admin panel.  Using this method it would also be possible to create 
temporary panels under the Plugins menu that only exist when accessed 
via that link.  Doing this is trivial:

add_filter('plugin_action', 'plugin_action_link');  // new hook
add_action('admin_menu', 'plugin_admin_menu');
function plugin_action_link($actions) {
	return $actions . '<a href="plugins.php?page='
		. plugin_basename(__FILE__)
		. '">' . __('Configure') . '</a>';
}
function plugin_admin_menu() {
	// A new add_plugin_options_page() function could
	// fill the role of this if() statement:
	if($_GET['page'] == plugin_basename(__FILE__)) {
		add_submenu_page(
			'plugins.php',
			'Configure Plugin',
			'Plugin Config',
			'activate_plugins',
			plugin_basename(__FILE__),
			'plugin_config_panel'
		);
	}
}
function plugin_config_panel() {
	// display this plugin's config panel
}

As a result, plugins with simple configurations could all display them 
directly on the plugins page without needlessly cluttering any submenus. 
  Plugins with existing configuration panels can also link to them 
directly from the Plugins list page, also eliminating the issue of 
having to hunt for an obscure or poorly located plugin options page.

Identical functionality to the described hook already exists in Matt 
Read's Installer.

Interestingly (is that a word) it didn't occur to me that my remarks
would or could be taken as a personal attack against anyone. I guess
that was rather naive. I certainly don't see your remarks as personal
attacks.

Anyways, just wanted to say that your remarks are very much how I feel,
and stated better than I managed. Thanks.

try:

How about a more sophisticated menu system - drop-down or flyout CSS menus?
http://www.projectseven.com/products/menusystems/mm2/ is the basis of this
suggestion.

That's called a fork. Fork is not a dirty word. Forks are almost always
good things, if they are viewed in the right light. The purpose of a
fork is to explore new ideas. Forks either succeed or fail. If they
succeed, they either replace the original, or they merge back in, or
they become an independent entity. Having a permanently parallel,
permanently dependent branch seems like a rather unhealthy thing.

When forks are viewed as a negative thing (as they seem to be, for some
reason, in the Wordpress world) then they are viewed with suspicion, and
as a threat. I think that's a very unhealthy view of forks.

There are many of us who have something to contribute, but simply don't
have sufficient passion to start a fork that will simply die from
neglect. That's a waste of everyone's time.

Here's where I disagree with you. If someone isn't able to be actively
involved, but is still in the position of bottleneck, then this is a
sign that the leadership needs to expand to more monkeys.

Democracy is not chaos. You just have to be selective about those to

**GASP!** Someone is actually vocalizing how I feel! I was starting to feel
alone, and without any voice - being a non-programmer.

"...not interacting enough with people outside of the
teeny coding community. There's a sense that they're not likely to know
what they want, and that their ideas are probably not particularly
valuable."

How true. End users can never have any valid insights on the package... how
could they? They aren't as smart as coders. Coders are always the best
testers for software - not the clueless end user. Sigh...

"one chief, many indians"

"Folks seem terrified that they're going to say or do something that Matt
disagrees with."

I concur wholeheartedly. If one is not part of the "inner circle" of Matt's
friends, commentary is unwanted and swiftly rejected. If one cannot code PHP
or any other language, one is instructed to learn to program - and do it
oneself. Not a very welcoming attitude, and far different from the other
open source communities I have been a part of.

Cult of personality runs thick through the WP community. Personally, I have
withdrawn from the community because of it. A pity...

Relegating "single setting" plugins to one sub menu (admittedly not my
first choice on this) would at the very least be a consistent feature,
hence easy to educate users about. I've lost count of the times I've
needed to point out comment settings. Options > Discussion doesn't
appear to be all that intuitive either, but it is easy to remember
once learned.

But an option or "configure" link alongside each plugin listing (at
least those which require such) seems as close to intuitive as one
might expect.

This was certainly the situation as recently as two months ago. Now,
the procedure for Getting Things Done in the WP community is simple:

* Raise the idea on hackers
* If the general feeling is "nice idea", and at least some of those
feelings have come experienced WP hackers, start a trac ticket
* WRITE CODE (really important)
* Get it reviewed by a few senior contributors, like bug gardeners.
* Modify your patch with their input
* Don't get bitchy if we decide it's a bad idea. If you've got to this
stage, that shouldn't happen, but it could.

I've found this method to be quite effective. Any examples of good
ideas being squashed are generally because one of those steps wasn't
completed.

As a side note, if your thread gets, say, one reply, it's probably not
going to get in. A lot of bad ideas are proposed by people who simply
don't have the experience to know they're bad ideas (nothing wrong
with that, we were all there once. I still am :)). The people who have
been around here a while have been around long enough to get tired of
these threads, so they don't bother replying to say "bad idea": it
would inevitably lead to an argument which would just end with the
oldie going "you're just going to have to trust me. it won't work/the
cons outweigh the pros/etc". The recent thread proposing a community
edition of WordPress is a good example. It took three days to get any
response whatsoever, and even that wasn't a +1.

In short: no response is a negative response. (aside: please don't
flame me in response to this. There's nothing wrong with a bad idea,
nor having one. How else do you think you'll learn?)

Another point to make is that there are a lot of people around who
will +1 bad ideas. Doesn't make them good ideas. If you don't get +1s
from the more senior contributors, it's probably a bad idea.

Of course, the inline docs thread was a counterexample to all this.
Clever people like Mark Jaquith and Robert Deaton got behind it and
made trac tickets, but it still got squashed. It doesn't _always_
work. :)

Hopefully that's illuminated some of the inner workings of the WP
development model.

plugins_loaded, as others have stated, will work. However I'd wait
until init, which guarentees you have the $wp, $wp_query and
$wp_rewrite globals available as well.

What exactly happened to this train of thought? Is there any
development going on with user-friendly error handling, or is this a
back-burner idea?

Just trying not to invent the wheel twice.

/me tosses Kaf some bananas and recruiting forms.

<soapbox>
I think that the concept of an "inner circle" is more of an emotional
outburst of frustration than reality. I should know, because I've done it
myself. What brought me back to reality was how at one time, when I was very
active in the support forums, I was labelled as being part of the inner
circle itself, presumably because I had moderator privileges on the forums.

I was taken aback that someone thought that I was a member of the inner
sanctum when, in reality, it took forever and a month of Sundays to get
moderator status. Podz and I were relentless in bugging Matt for that, and
when time permitted, it was granted. I never had the inside track on version
releases or feature enhancements or anything else from the coding side. It
is, however, easy to understand why people think and believe that there are
some "blessed" individuals that make up part of an inner sanctum. It's a
natural human response to feel excluded when we are not in-the-know about
something.

I'm not here to apologise for anyone, but to be fair, a lot of really good
things have happened around WP, and that's due to the contributions of a lot
of dedicated people as well as many who contribute on a casual basis. There
are plenty of areas that need improvement, and as long as there are those
willing to express themselves, improvements will happen. It just may not be
at the speed at which many of us would like.

There was, and still is, quite a gulf between ordinary users and WP hackers.
How many calls for help has Podz posted in this mailing list when he
recognized that the community needed an answer he couldn't provide? It often
takes a lot of his time to get someone to respond, when it doesn't
necessarily require Matt or Ryan's intervention. It's time for each of us to
accept some personal responsibility on how the community has and will
continue to develop. There are a lot of good things, so let's not forget
those or, in some instances, ignore those things only to emphasize those
issues that are divisive.

We gotta keep banging the drums; we gotta continue pushing, and when our
ideas or other contributions are not accepted, we have to remember that it's
not personal, and that all of us are working towards the common goal of
having a great piece of software and a thriving community to support it on
many facets.

Actually Akismet was put under Plugins very deliberately. It was 
originally under "Options".

People would activate the plugin, and not think anything had changed. 
Seeing a new menu item pop up was comforting and gave them a logical 
next place to go.

Also many plugins don't tell you where their menus are going. Ever 
activate a plugin and then click around 2-4 menu items to see where it 
stuck its stuff?

"Manage" is a little to abstract, we could logically put *everything* 
under manage. I think we should move the most used things to the top.

New ideas are constantly being integrated as they come up, which is one 
of the reasons our roadmap has never been very accurate. That's okay 
though, because things on I put on the roadmap that draw no interest 
often do so because they're not that useful, see RFC 3229 support or 
whatever it was caused.

Some people feel their ideas get included less than others, which 
certainly may be true, but that's because of the ideas not because of 
the person.

Other systems have always provided inspiration for WordPress, which I 
think has done well by synthesizing some of the best ideas from other 
projects. We're the only project I know of that links to direct 
competitors on our about page and thanks them.

I would say the Shuttle group is a pretty strong counter-example to 
this. They've had a very strong influence on 2.0 and continue to do so 
even though none of them code.

While some people may have been friends before they got involved with 
WordPress, everyone I know in the team I met through their contributions.

There is no inner circle, there's just people who get things done and 
people who don't. I have little regard for the latter. There are tons of 
ways for non-code people to get things done and contribute tremendously, 
as numerous stars on the Codex and forums have shown.

That said, people working on a project for fun in their spare time are 
less likely to tolerate assholes. Life's too short.

WordPress itself is a fork, and in the past we've offered hosting and 
support to people forking WP. At the end of the day the more OS code 
being created the better. Most people care about the product, not the 
process, and what I love about open source is the best ideas always 
survive. Forking is a necessary element of that evolution.

I think any negative connotation to forking comes from the anti-social 
nature of people who fork without trying to work with the existing 
community, and from users who worry about fragmentation of what already 
may be scarce resources.

I've heard rumors that WordPress developers prefer to spoon, but I'm not 
aware of any conclusive research into the matter.

That wasn't about you or anyone here, if I had a specific problem with 
someone I would say it, for the same reasons I appreciate skippy's 
original email said "Matt" instead of abstractly referring to the 
specific person he had in mind.

It was more a general observation about creating a pleasant and fun 
environment for people to participate in. You catch more flies with 
honey than vinegar and all that. I'm sorry if you thought it was talking 
about you. By definition I would think that non-masochists continue to 
participate in WordPress because they get something out of it. I think 
that's different for every person, and we should encourage whatever it is.

First off, I'm really not sure where to post this, so sorry if this  
is the wrong place.

For once, I think their pros/cons summarise the (short) review well.

Pros: Free; easy installation; new user-friendly text editor.
Cons: New text editor doesn't work in Safari; some older plugins and  
themes aren't compatible

Only one mistake I've noticed, "Even when the basic software is free,  
advance features, such as password protection for individual posts,  
can incur a charge."

To summarise the article (just one point per paragraph):

- Other third-party hosted blogging solutions, can be costly
- WordPress, open source, highly configurable and free
- "For this major new release of WordPress the Developers have  
focused their efforts on the area you'll spend most of your time in ?  
the writing interface"
- "TinyMCE JavaScript technology"
- Cut and Paste from other pages and retain style
- Lack of support for Safari and older versions of Opera, though you  
can still type HTML
- Previewing posts frame
- Changes making it easier for plugin authors, although many of the  
older plugins/templates won't work

- Conclusion: "WordPress is one of the best blogging  solutions on  
the market. It's highly configureable, gives you complete control  
over your blog and best of all it's total free. The new text-editing  
tools make it well worth upgrading."



I'd've posted the whole article, if it weren't for copyright concerns.

I submitted this ticket, which apparently was queued for commit for "2.1."
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1786

I'd be interested in replacing "die" calls through WP with similar hooks.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Cron Improvements and Error Logging
Message-ID: <a491f91d0603082230q1b2cdce6j9aa6824e797fa235@mail.gmail.com>

Mark Jaquith and I had some discussion on IRC tonights about some
thoughts I've been mediating on for a while, and so I've finally
formalized a list of various stuff I'm going to code, hopefully for
inclusion into WordPress (it'll be coded regardless). The first one is
a GUI for the new cron code (this will go in a plugin if it doesn't
make the core), the second is an error logger (and a generic db table
for logging information, this is shooting for core inclusion as it
requires some mods that plugins just can't do). Here's a quick and
dirty outline of my ideas, I'm looking for constructive criticism,
improvements on ideas, and maybe even downplaying the ideas if you can
provide some other argument than "I don't like it". In case this gets
screwed up in the mail, plaintext doc is
http://somethingunpredictable.com/tmp/ideas.txt

Cron
	Ensure future publishing works
	Finalize API
	Clean up code
	Work on GUI:
		The GUI should have a list of the currently scheduled hooks, which includes:
			-A short description of what they do
			-The last time it ran
			-The next time its scheduled to run
			-A link to remove non-essential crons (Future posting shouldn't be removed)
		The GUI should allow you to schedule hooks to be run by:
			-Showing a table of the possible events that can be scheduled, with
descriptions of what they are,
			recommended running times, and a link to schedule that hook
			-The page to schedule should remind the user what they're
scheduling, provide a dropdown list of how
			often to schedule this event (perhaps, since its such a simplistic
form, we could find a way to
			integrate this into the table, up for thoughts)
		The GUI should recommend a few of the default actions to run,
specifically the cleanup cron
		should be run on a regular basis, things like spam purging and
backup are pretty important as well.
		We should have a few base crons:
			1) Backup. (recommended)
			2) Publish E-mail Posts. (put under recommended if this has been
set up, add links to scheduling it
			from the options page on this.
			3) Check for updates (When the new plugin manager is integrated,
this could fire
			occasionally to see if there is a WP or plugin update.
			4) Check for blogroll/link updates
			5) A generalized cleanup cron that should include:
				Purging spam
				Ensuring that the post and comment counts are correct
				Repair/Optimize MySQL tables
				Clear the error log (see below)
		Obviously, the whole thing must be pluggable, the GUI itself may end
up in a plugin if it doesn't make the core
Error logging
	Make the formal $wpdb->log table schema, which should be a table
suitable enough for generic logging by
	other plugins, brainstorm:
		log_id
		log_type (error for the error logger)
		log_subtype (subtype for the actual logger to store its type)
		log_data (a big text or blob for whatever data the logger needs to store)
		log_message (to log the error message)
		log_count (the count of number of times this error has occured)
		log_date_gmt (the last occurance of an error)
	Obviously, for plugins, these fields could be unused depending on purposes.
	For error logging, the log_subtype should include SQL for SQL errors,
PHP for PHP Warnings (notices, stricts
	are too frequent to log in the WP codebase), 404s (I believe these
should be logged by default). log_data could
	be a serialized object or array of all the data, file, line, etc.,
and a constant for developers could make the
	logging code store var_dumps and backtraceswhere necessary.
	This whole thing is API'd out for custom log types and messages that
plugins can display in the viewer.
	The viewer could potentially, as part of the messages, recommend
fixes or links to documentation on the problems.
	We move most of the nasty die()s and such to calling trigger_error so
that these problems can be logged and
	dealt with properly.

Misc thoughts:

* If it's all "API'd out", Isn't it the error *handler* part that's
needed in the core, then, rather than the logger? Logging can be just
one of multiple possible actions when an error occurs, along with
emailing/paging the admin, displaying a message, redirecting to
another page...

* What about a pluggable error handler loaded like the object cache?

* I'm concerned about reliance on a DB table because one of the errors
I'm most interested in acting on is a failure to connect to the
database.

* It's hard to take action on specific errors unless there's some kind
of error code system, and error codes are a pain to remember. Is it
better to have a code for every different message -- in which case
there'll be a *lot* -- or just a few, like a general
"NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH_HA_HA" kind of thing sent with all of the permission
denied messages, "CANT_READ_COMMENT_INSTRUCTIONS" for the comment
posting errors, etc.?

And thus the API'd out, if you want to send e-mails, an early loaded
plugin could do so for most userspace events. A hook inside the error
handler could allow custom code to be run. However, logging is the
reason for having an error handler, and a generic logger has, imho,
been something we've needed for plugin developers for a while.

> * What about a pluggable error handler loaded like the object cache?

More editing files, pain in the butt, a user shouldn't have to go
through the hassle.

If you can't connect to your database, you have bigger problems.
Besides, how would WP know your e-mail address on how to contact you
and all if you can't connect to the database to begin with?

Now you're assuming everything is going to trigger an error, and that
all things will have error codes. The database schema allows for you
to not ever really have to remember some set of error codes, you just
write in the error with the message you want to display and that's
that.

And did you really have to split this off into a seperate thread? The
whole point of the original was to get feedback on this.

It's just two ways of looking at the same thing -- binding actions to
events -- except that I think the handler part is more important than
the log-action part. This is mostly because I care less about logging
most events than (for example) giving users a pretty custom error page
to look at, displaying status messages in the admin interface etc.

That's the point! The handler can solve my bigger problems. It could
alert me to the difficulties. It could redirect visitors to a static
version of the site. It could be linked to a script that tries to
restart mysqld. At the very least it could be logged!

That's one of the reasons why I suggested a pluggable handler a la the
object cache. It gives extreme flexibility to people who don't care
about having to edit an extra file.

There's also no reason that the default handler couldn't be
user-friendly and use $wpdb when it becomes available:

   if (!empty($wpdb) && is_a($wpdb, 'wpdb')) // ...etc

Status code, then. Forget the error part. If you want to bind an event
to some specific action -- with do_action() in a plugin, for example
-- you need a code or some other kind of identifier. (Unless you're
just checking for a specific message string, and please let's not go
there...)

Yes, because I didn't want to talk about cron. :P

Cron: I like the idea as a plugin but I would not force such a complex
thing as that into software I would encourage my mother to use. I hate
answering her questions with "ignore that feature. It's not for you."
That's not to say I wouldn't value such a thing myself. if you wrote
that plugin I would use it personally.

Logging: interesting. Not my cup of tea, but certainly useful to many.
I think if you kept it to critical problems, such as might cause a
person to show up at the forums, it could be worthwhile. However,
adding an error log viewer to the admin interface doesn't fly in my
mind, and you don't want to expose this kind of log to public access.

The beginnings of a simple solution for core:
function wp_log_error($level = 1) {
 if ($level >= WP_LOG_LEVEL)
  do_action('log_error', func_get_args());
}
Then go through the code and find all the places where you have your
ugly die() calls and call this instead. I don't know what else you'd
want core to do with errors besides make them available to plugins and
maybe standardize its error messages.

Not that fatal errors are a problem for anyone other than devs or
people installing plugins or themes, but I did have a method of nice
fatal error reporting: ob_start, output the error message, try the
action, ob_end_clean. A fatal error in the middle will flush the
buffered error message to the browser.

I hope you sent an angry email correcting this. Any idea that
WordPress isn't totally free is one that should be squashed. Any
chance they could publish a correction?

My sentiments exactly - even though I'm a plugin developer. It seems I have to be very careful of what I say. I don't think there is anything wrong with an inner circle of developers, but maybe a little less ego and more openess to suggestions and ideas would be a good thing. Even a little friendliness to those that have less of a clue, instead of waiting to jump down their throat at the first opportunity would also be nice. When people do open their mouths, it's because they give a damn.

  **GASP!** Someone is actually vocalizing how I feel! I was starting to feel
  alone, and without any voice - being a non-programmer.

  "...not interacting enough with people outside of the
  teeny coding community. There's a sense that they're not likely to know
  what they want, and that their ideas are probably not particularly
  valuable."

  How true. End users can never have any valid insights on the package... how
  could they? They aren't as smart as coders. Coders are always the best
  testers for software - not the clueless end user. Sigh...

  "one chief, many indians"

  "Folks seem terrified that they're going to say or do something that Matt

  I concur wholeheartedly. If one is not part of the "inner circle" of Matt's
  friends, commentary is unwanted and swiftly rejected. If one cannot code PHP
  or any other language, one is instructed to learn to program - and do it
  oneself. Not a very welcoming attitude, and far different from the other
  open source communities I have been a part of.

  Cult of personality runs thick through the WP community. Personally, I have
  withdrawn from the community because of it. A pity...

Well, not an angry email, but an email never the less. As for  
publishing a correction, I'll just have to wait to hear back from  
David Fanning (the Editor).

Figured I'd post it here since I haven't seen anyone else do so yet.

They're basically trying to execute a DoS based upon repeated 
registration attempts.  If we were to start implementing a wait time on 
registrations coming from a single IP, it would likely ameliorate this 
'exploit'.

Steve, you mind posting that as a reply on the sf website?

Also, seriously, isn't pretty much every script on every website is 
susceptible to some form, better or worse, of DoS attack?  Is there anything 
unique to WP here?  Wouldn't ANY hacker script that quickly, repeatedly 
opens up near-unlimited sockets to a website be a "DoS attack"?  Aside from 
the particular 'mechanics' of registering a user, why is this any 'more' of 
a DoS than anything else?

And I assume since mod_security can filter this, that any adaptive 
hardware/anti-DoS firewall should pick up on a single IP trying to open 
hundreds/thousands of connections to a particular box, right?

While we're at it, why is DoS being called a 'security vulnerability'?  It's 
a service, uptime vulnerability -- totally different class of issues, and 
not one the average joe should ever have to worry about (frankly, if someone 
wants to launch a DoS attack on an average joe's site, there isn't a single 
thing average joe can do about it -- it's up to the OS, drivers, hardware, 
firewalls, sysadmins, NOCs, etc.  Or at least that's my view of the world.

Along those lines, here's a proof of concept to mass block user 
registrations from the same IP within 5 minutes.  (It also blocks brute 
force password cracks.)

The comment blocking thing is already done, I think.  ;)

I wish people were, on the whole, friendlier, the way they used to be,
more considerate of others, more tolerant, and less prone to jumping
to conclusions. I am not talking about developers, or users, or any
subset of people. Just everyone, in general. For someone who helps out
in his spare time, having to put up with personal comments of an evil
nature, slander, indifference and having one's motives questioned
isn't very nice. I have been through those things before. It slowly
takes the fun out of participating, you know, and you tend to think of
something as a chore. That's the point where I'd stop contributing.
That point could be different for different people, but people, please
be nice to each other, and more tolerant.
The forums stopped being a nice place, and these days I sometimes find
the tone and voice vicious over there. The #wordpress chat room wasn't
as obscene, or filled with inane oneliners.

The number of people who actively contribute are far more now, and
that is really cool. May they be recognized and appreciated, so they
get encouraged to do more.

Yo, Skippy! Hang in there. Don't leave :)

Carthik.

SecurityFocus needs a moderator to keep this kind of crap off the list.
This is no better than the "power vulnerability", whereby if you cut the
power cord to a server, it will stop running.

Nicely whipped-up.

Of course, it sends an email and updates two options in the database every 
attempt (which I assume is only one write, but still...) -- that's about the 
same as a new registration, though minus the 'cost' of the explosion in the 
user table size. ;)

Of course, if done as distributed DoS, it would populate the options table 
with a ton of extra/dead data, probably then an equal or worse case... ;)

Again, my assumption is if you took the sample script, and changed it to hit 
pretty much any PHP page, certainly anything with a database read, or write, 
it'd probably take down 50% of the machines on resources alone.  The email 
definitely just adds to the fire. :)

I agree... they got MUCH busier, and I'm not sure that the forums themselves 
are keeping up with the load.  bbpress could use further feature work both 
for users and admins/techies (including notification services other than RSS 
to 'track' both individual threads and overall category status), there could 
use to be more granular breakdown of sections/categories (just imho), useful 
search has been broken for so long that it's just embarrassing, etc.  The 
actual layout/design could also potentially be less stylish, easier to 
navi/read.

Again, just imho.

I agree with you fully, Carthik. Though I don't have a basis for comparison,
I found the forums to be full of vanity and demand. I participated heavily
for a week due to a committed I had made, but I soon realised it was not
for me. Other communities were friendlier and more inviting.

I'd second that. WordPress needs you, buddy.

I mostly lurk on this list, but it seems to me, the day Skippy throws in
the towel, everyone else can as well, because it seems like he's the
critical link between the "us" and the "them". (Nudge: something needs
to be done about this before Skippy burns out and runs away screaming.)

Matt - maybe let someone know? Please? We are a fairly important little

Roy,

He's aware it's out.
The point was that Podz found out on his own.
NO ONE was informed of this release, which would help people like Podz
and co. prepare.
I only know it came out because of the version bump checkin.

I have yet to even read the WP dev blog yet.

Something like:
Even if Matt were to just come in and say:
"Hey gang, WP 2.0.2 is going to get it's version bump in 24 hours, and
there shouldn't be any more fixes/checkins until then."

Simple, quick, and informative.
That's all Podz is asking.
(I think.  Maybe he'd like a *little* more than that.)

You're  right. I missed that point entirely because Podz was succinct  and
almost cryptic. Either way, I guess we ought to Digg this story so that it
makes the front page.

http://digg.com/software/WordPress_2.0.2_Security_Release

Judging  by  the pace of increments, many people will remain in the  dark,
which is worrisome. The least I could do was to bind a comment.

With kind regards,

Roy

And, yet, it doesn't. That only happens if the barrier to entry is too
high, and is arbitrary. When it is low and well documented, then
everyone understands exactly what it takes to become a committer, and
nobody can be arbitrarily excluded for unspecified reasons.

No, I'm not suggesting that everyone can, or should, operate in The
Apache Way. I'm just saying that it doesn't necessarily lead to chaos
and madness.

Can somene answer definitively does this affect versions prior to wordpress
2.0? The 2.0.2 release announcement seems vague.

Perhaps, except those are two different code paths.  Emails should only 
be sent in the case of detected login hacking, not in the case of 
multiple registrations.

If the update_options() was stuffed into an additional else{} it could 
eliminate database writes on failed registration attempts inside the 
delay period.

Something more effective would report the IP to some firewall 
configuration automation system.

Well, like I said, the email only happens on login hacking attempts, 
certainly not at any generically-aimed request.  This isn't a serious 
attempt at "fixing" security issues, just a casual one for the lazy blog 
admin.  ;)

Like you said, though, if a distributed DoS targetted any common 
unprotected blog, it would take it down pretty easily.  Blog software is 
simply not geared for handing such a scenario, which is better done at 
the router/firewall level.

It seems Podz wants to know, in advance, so he can plan on womanning (and
manning) the forums when the release is made public.

Rather than speculate if that request is realistic, I applaude Podz for his
tenacity regarding this subject--he makes the same request almost every
release cycle.

I removed my dash a very long time ago.

Where is the harm in giving a release day ? I don't mean in advance, I
don't mean several months before. I DO mean when the code has been
judged to be solid enough.
Why not?
After all, at the moment the devs did that you could all have sat back,
breathed a deep sigh and looked forward to a weekend off. Right at that
point someone may have been patching something. Others may have been
upgrading to 2.0.1. So why not say?

Can't the devs see that is actions like this that demonstrate a lot of
the attitude that people like me see and dislike ?

Whatever. Like a damn thing will change.

You mean like the due date on trac milestones?

http://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.0.2

That one was off by a bit, but no fault of the devs: there was an
underwhelming amount of testers willing to give the RC a whirl, so
testing had to be done by a few people, which slows things down.

Maybe - but at some point it WAS decided to go and it was let loose.
All I am trying - and yet again complete failing - to ask is that IF you
want support for the product it would nice to at least let the forums
know. You guys just don't see it do you? You really don't have a clue.

I was testing the RCs. How was anybody to know that though? Why do you
assume that there was a shortage of testers? Are we supposed to register or
something?

Communication, people!

Who exactly is this comment aimed at? No dev could have done anything
about the delay.

Someone decided on that date, it was placed onto trac. Trac is
development central. Now you know where things are is everything okay?

Where's the guidelines on testing? What was I supposed to be looking for? I
could have wasted my time and that of the devs etc., by looking for
something they weren't even interested in. This was a security release, and
I had no knowledge or way of testing the effectiveness of the fixes.

You can't cop out and put the blame on the testers, David. That's a pile of
moose candy. Tell me what to test for, and what kind of feedback you want,
and I'll do it. I assumed, and wrongly given your comments, that "no news
was good news."

I'm not a frikkin' mind reader, I'm just a user.

What I think Podz is asking for is a "heads-up" post to the wp-forums list
when a new version is released. Ideally *before* it's released, so that
support forum volunteers can be aware that there is likely to be a rush of
questions about that new release. In the case of a "security fix" release, I
can understand that it's not always possible to give much notice, but the
forums list does need to be informed as soon as possible.

Support can be a rough, thankless task (I'll spare you the moans about my
day job), and it isn't made any easier when information is not disseminated.
Not all support people are monitoring trac - they're just people who *use*
WP and like to help other people who use it.

It's not unreasonable to ask for a warning or announcement. It *is*
unreasonable, in my not even remotely humble opinion, to dismiss such
requests this way.

Your newfound verbosity sways me. I agree with you. A note to hackers
and testers would be an easy and valuable courtesy.

Have you found that attitude the best way to get Matt to listen to
you? I haven't. You know how to contact him directly.

I'm sorry you're ticked off.

I tested the RC.  I gave my one note, which turned out to be a false 
alarm (and
I posted that, too).

But since there's no test procedure, no test response form, etc., I 
didn't send
in the non-existent test results form.

Even something as simple as a standard notice like this:

Please test WP 2.0.2 RC1.  Please return positive or negative results in the
following format:
Server OS: ______
PHP version: _____
mySQL version: _____
WP version upgraded from: ______ (or clean install: ________)
Plugins used: _________
Theme used: _________
Was the installation documentation adequate: ________
Did you encounter any errors during the upgrade: _______
Did you find any errors or anomalous behavior in your blog after the upgrade:
________
Did the upgrade break any plugins: ________________
What errors did the plugins report: _______________
And so on...

If you want specific functions tested, spell out a test procedure to make sure
that you're getting apples-to-apples on every different type of server
configuration.  Ask for specific results to those test procedures, not just a
general "Hey everyone, test the list of 16 things we posted in Trac.  Go dig
into all of the diffs and figure out what happened in the middle of an obscure
API call yourself."

If you just ask for feedback you'll get poor feedback that doesn't help you
establish that you got a broad base of server OS's, PHP and mySQL versions,
plugins used, etc.

(For what it's worth, I signed up on the "Tester's" sign up on the Codex right
after Matt sent out the request for sign up.  I have NEVER been contacted as a
result of that sign up.  I wonder if anyone else has either.  An unfollowed
process is a good as no process.)

Bingo!

Example message to WP-Forums (and other "what's up" list forum/Codex helpers
are expected to monitor):

----------
~Subject: 2.0.2 release
~Date: 3.09.2006 13:30

Hey all, we've got 2.0.2 ready to go for Friday morning, my time. Will update
if that changes for any reason.

Sorry.  I left in one too many "David House wrote" statements.  
Everything after
David's two lines in my last post are my writing, not David's.

Do your usual routine. Does it crash and burn?  Test the bugs on the 
list I sent.  How do those look?

Just having people load it up and run through their usual routine is 
helpful.  People sitting around waiting to be told what to do is not at 
all helpful.

Load it, kick the tires, does anything break.  Free form testing is 
better than doing nothing.

So, somebody write some test plans already.

Well, since I'm not privy to the code changes, and even if I was, I wouldn't
understand it anyway, I need to be told what specific things are meant to be
tested. I did install and upgrade the RCs. I did check that my plugins were
still working, so I didn't exactly sit around and do nothing. That said, I
didn't know if what I was doing really had any value for the devs.

I'd write a test routine, if I had the slightest clue what to do, but all I
can do is follow one. I just want to do what I can, when I can. If my
participation is not helping, then do tell me and I'll quit wasting my time
and yours ("yours" being the collective list).

one of them was written in 2001, so i'm not sure my inquiry  has merit.

Most likely the same benifits has Gallery has had with that kind of development.
I believe David House discussed that with Bharat, from the Gallery team, in #wordpress a few months ago.

I'd like to stop being bitter and actually get something productive
out of this thread. I echo the statements that a testing procedure
would perhaps make people less familiar with the software feel a bit
more useful. So, here's my proposal for a bufix release:

* Run through the list of bugs that we've supposedly fixed (Ryan
linked to it in his testers post)
* Use the software as you normally do, with plugins. Don't forget
things like feeds, enclosures, links, users, etc.
* Report back with as much information as you have. Install dump-env
[1] and give us the output of that. Mention what works, what breaks,
anything you've noticed. The more information the better.

How does that sound?

As for the message to forums, that's easily done. If it makes a
difference, I don't see why not.

Oh, and you mentioned you don't know how to test the security fixes.
No problem. They're only a handful of bugs, and they get tested more
than any others. Just take it that they work.

Yeah, I've got the logs if anyone wants them. I don't think unit
testing works unless you do test driven development, and I don't think
that's a direction we want to move into.

i read somewhere that it takes 10 minutes to write the code but takes 
days to write & run unit tests for it. heh, h0bbel can attest to that! :)

Read the bug list.  The bugs are written by users who are describing 
symptoms.  Test those symptoms.  That's why I provided the link to the 
bugs.  That's why we manage the bug lists and make sure everything is 
milestoned.

I'm talking to the list in general.  Talking about these things is 
necessary and proper.  But if everyone talks and nobody does the work, 
this isn't much of a community.  It's just an echo chamber for people's 
grievances.

I told you during the IRC Meetup that release was nigh, that it would be 
out at soon as we could get some more feedback.  I've been setting the 
stage for a 2.0.2 release for the last week or two.

What do you do to prepare for a release?  How much notice do you need?

 From where I sit, notice is a luxury.  We often get no notice when 
these illiterate security notices hit the lists and we get flooded with 
hysterical questions in response.  We race to address these issues and 
do damage control with the Linux distributions and hosting providers. 
All of this is done while bile and whinging is flung at us.  So, I'm 
less than sympathetic to pleas for a luxury that I am rarely afforded. 
In my opinion, there was plenty of time for everyone to prepare for 2.0.2.

I gave a target release and set a milestone earlier, but we had to slip 
due to a last minute bug and lack of testing feedback.  Such is the way 
it goes.

Are you being rhetorical?  Everyone who was actually contributing to 
getting the release out had already finished their parts and signed off.

When the release was ready, it was announced.

People ascribe a lot to us.  Most of it is FUD and it gets very old.  I 
wish people would look at their own attitudes on occasion.  Do you think 
I like the constant complaints?

> Whatever. Like a damn thing will change.

Things are changing all the time.  We've gone through alot of change in 
the development process and community in the past few months, as was 
attested earlier in this thread.

I don't want to speak for Podz... but, okay, lemme try! ;)

I >think< he was asking for something like: post to the hackers list just 
prior to uploading, or maybe before switching links over to, the new version 
(assuming there's a manual step there).

"setting the stage ... for the last week or two" is different from an email 
to hackers with the title "RELEASE: WP 2.0.2".  I believe there was a whole 
thread on having some various notification emails out to wp-hackers at 
various stages.  Oh yeah, related to the original WP2 release, which was 
going to happen, then pushed back, then decided to get it out despite 
numerous pleas to hold off a few days -- that whole thread discussed this 
notification topic, certainly. ;)

I for one don't need yet-another email subscription, but if we felt the need 
for a list just for release notifications, whether 'something will be 
coming' (due to a security matter), 'planned upcoming release' (i.e., within 
a few weeks) and 'imminent release' (i.e., minutes or hours), that'd be 
good.  I admit I don't even know if there is a wp-announce, and whether all 
of this is being done (this is all I subscribe to!).

Just trying to lend a voice to Podz, as I know his must be going horse by 
now. ;)

There _are_ no other stages.

1) We write, we fix, it's ready.
2) An email is sent to testers. (In the future it'd be nice to send it
to the other lists as well, I'm +1 here.)
3) We test, people test.
4) It's released, devblog announcement.

Where else would you put notifications?

I'm personally still not sure how much more specific notification is
needed. I guess if you all really want the week of notification of the
exact date and time a release will be made, we could tell the devs to
simply tell us the moment they are absolutely ready for release that
it will be released in exactly one week. But of course, for a security
release, this is unacceptable, the release needs to be out as soon as
possible, and I'm sure had the other vulnerabilities that aren't
published yet been made public, there would have been cries for the
opposite side of "the release didn't come fast enough." (I'd like to
make a note that this is not the same as my earlier complaints of
brushing off the fake vulnerability with no official word, before
someone calls me a hypocrite)


On this one, I have to side with Ryan, I think that 2.0.2 had plenty
of release given the circumstances, in fact, you had notice of it
coming out earlier than it actually did.

"Where else would you put notifications?"
=> Did you read what you quoted from me? :) :)

Email to wp-hackers for releases, in big capital letters.  That I'd see --  
we'd all see.  I don't watch the devblog, I don't have a dashboard.  If 
there's a wp-announce for releases, security issues, etc., I guess I'd 
subscribe.  Signal to noise would be low... ;)

I can attest to the exact opposite. Proper test driven development
speeds up your development immensely . It also speeds up subsequent
refactoring.

I have spent the last 15+ months doing test driven development. I
produced a 50,000 line Java application which currently runs just over
1500 automated tests every time it is built (about 3.5 minutes for a
build and test run). About 200 of those tests are run post-deployment
in-server against two different servlet engines.

Whilst unit tests are much harder to retrofit to existing code. Every
single automated test written is an advantage.

Simple solution: subscribe to the devblog. No point duplicating the information.

I think what Podz and others are looking for is something BEFORE hand.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the devblog post comes at release.
Knowing before hand allows the support team to prepare, and not wake
up to a nightmare on the forums.

Notice is a LUXURY for people who donate loads of their time to
supporting your product? I think not. Most people/companies pay large
sums of money to people like Podz who output the quality of support
that he does (as far as I know, he doesn't get any money for such
things, and even if he does, this applies to some others in the
support community, I'm sure).

I'm sorry you have to deal with these horrid "security releases," but
that comes with the territory of being a developer of a large
open-source project. There could have been an official response to the
earlier security releases (as Robert Deaton recommended), but there
was none, and therefore, you got no relead. If you don't want to deal
with the damage control, get a PR manager as suggested earlier in the
thread. That would -completely- deal with that problem.

So to say you're less than sympathetic to pleas for what you call a
"luxury" seems to me to be complete and utter bull. I'd hate to seem
like some dev-hating loon, but I will not let myself hold back my
opinion on this one. While I don't disagree that 2.0.2 had enough
notice, I have seen other versions that didn't have as much
notification. Notice, if only for big forum contributers such as Podz,
should be considered a mandate, not a luxury.

That should read "was none, and therefore, you got no relief. If you
don't want to deal." Sorry for the double-post.

Mailman will have informed you. *smile*

I suppose the least 'noisy' way to finger mailing lists on this domain is to
post a test to one of the abandoned ones. Look: wiki-tech.

Either a badly configured server (usually a 500) or a simple fluke. It was
delivered just fine the last time Google visited:

I am getting 403 (forbidden). Could be indirectly related to the above as it

I'm here and I'm freaking exhausted.  Hearing about what people are 
doing with WordPress and how much they like it is encouraging though. 
Lots of people appreciate what we're doing here.  Some foks have asked 
me to pass on the praise to those of you who help maintain WordPress and 
write all of the cool plugins.  We're also getting some nice propers for 
the growing set of docs and the active forums.  Keep it up.

I'm either blind or stupid (likely the latter), but I don't seem to
see a tags/2.0.2 in SVN. From looking at Trac, it appears that
upgrading to branches/2.0 will get the 2.0.2 release for now - is that
correct?

Yes the 2.0.2 was developped under braches 2.0, i suppose that in the
next days Ryn will tag a 2.0.2 as usual. Practically trunk is used for
future version, braches for a "dormient" version ready for urgently
update lieke security flwn etc. and tags for realeased version

I've been trying to tag, but the server problems are preventing me. 
Hopefully that will be fixed soon.

Hi Guys,

Im in the process of writting a user profile plugin that allows for 
displaying and editing a registered users details within the front end 
of the site and also allowing for them to ammend there details.

I was having issuses with getting the password to be changed untill i 
relised that i needed to delete the cache after updating wp_users.

This is what i have for the "change password" part of my plugin

http://pastecode.net/?action=viewpost&tag=736

What is the correct way of keeping the user logged in while changing 
there password and updating the cache??

Many Thanks

Message-ID: <5a715c0a0603142319u6b61be5ew94d8b0ee1e3d36f1@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys n' gals,

I have a fairly peculiar problem on my hands. For K2 we've implemented
an AJAX solution for pages. It's still in infancy, but it works by and
large. That is unless you use %category% in your permalink rewrites,
then it totally breaks, resulting in the loop returning no posts.

We have it well documented here:
http://getk2.com/bugs/view.php?id=247, and currently I'm thinking the
blame lies with WP somehow, though I'm unsure how to go about finding
out whether that's the case or not.

Anyone know anything about this or have any bright ideas?

Michael,
Could it perhaps be related to the category-in-url related problem
that Alex mentioned here

Might be. There seems to be a whole load of issues with using %category% in
rewrites. I found a bunch on the rewrite codex page as well...

Am I right to assume this is a WP issue?

It certainly looks that way, though I haven't looked too closely.

I'm either blind or stupid (likely the latter), but I don't seem to
see a tags/2.0.2 in SVN. From looking at Trac, it appears that
upgrading to branches/2.0 will get the 2.0.2 release for now - is that
correct?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Front End User Profile Changes
Message-ID: <44169BEF.2070201@phunky.co.uk>


Hi Guys,

Im in the process of writting a user profile plugin that allows for 
displaying and editing a registered users details within the front end 
of the site and also allowing for them to ammend there details.

I was having issuses with getting the password to be changed untill i 
relised that i needed to delete the cache after updating wp_users.

This is what i have for the "change password" part of my plugin

http://pastecode.net/?action=viewpost&tag=736

What is the correct way of keeping the user logged in while changing 
there password and updating the cache??

Many Thanks

Message-ID: <5a715c0a0603142319u6b61be5ew94d8b0ee1e3d36f1@mail.gmail.com>


Hey guys n' gals,

I have a fairly peculiar problem on my hands. For K2 we've implemented
an AJAX solution for pages. It's still in infancy, but it works by and
large. That is unless you use %category% in your permalink rewrites,
then it totally breaks, resulting in the loop returning no posts.

We have it well documented here:
http://getk2.com/bugs/view.php?id=247, and currently I'm thinking the
blame lies with WP somehow, though I'm unsure how to go about finding
out whether that's the case or not.

Anyone know anything about this or have any bright ideas?

Michael,
Could it perhaps be related to the category-in-url related problem
that Alex mentioned here

Might be. There seems to be a whole load of issues with using %category% in
rewrites. I found a bunch on the rewrite codex page as well...

Am I right to assume this is a WP issue?

Yes the 2.0.2 was developped under braches 2.0, i suppose that in the
next days Ryn will tag a 2.0.2 as usual. Practically trunk is used for
future version, braches for a "dormient" version ready for urgently
update lieke security flwn etc. and tags for realeased version

I've been trying to tag, but the server problems are preventing me. 
Hopefully that will be fixed soon.

It is unlikely to be WP. I have heard on this list that it is a matter of
the server configuration and the version of Apache running. I've run into
problems with %category% in the past - and others' results vary.

Does %category% work on your site sans-AJAX?

Are you using:

On the rewrite page on the Codes, it says that while the %category%
rewriting was a problem on 1.5 due to Apache versions, on 2.0 it's not
supposed to be...

Yes, it works if you just feed the parameter directly into the site, without
AJAX.

Hi All,

Just to introduce myself, I am Shawn McKenzie, the author of the AutoTheme HTML
Theme System for PHP-Nuke, MDPro, PostNuke, osCommerce and CRE Loaded.

It was fairly easy, so at the request of many users, I adapted AutoTheme to be
used with WordPress.  This opens the door to thousands of great themes for
WordPress users.

AutoTheme allows users to theme any page on their site easily using just an HTML
editor.  AutoTheme also brings the concept of blocks to WordPress, replacing the
side bar with individual blocks that can be placed anywhere on the site.

You can Download a copy and learn all about AutoTheme at http://www.spidean.com/

I look forward to working with all of you, helping as needed, and  I appreciate
any feedback.

Thanks!
-Shawn

Message-ID: <c3e037930603151507i7232e247q4e6b3afa6127b6b8@mail.gmail.com>

It's been mentioned that colgroup is still not usable in a blog entry (see
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/65115). This has been mentioned in the
past and a patch had been made which was supposed to have addressed this
issue: http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1914

I've tried it on my test installation and it still appears to be outstanding
despite the change. Any ideas before I file this as a bug?

I don't mean to be harsh but I really don't understand the need of such a
system when WP has a fairly capable theme system. It doesn't appear to offer
any significant advantages beyond what's already provided by the core theme
engine.

I visited the site hoping to see "thousands" of themes, thinking it would be
nice to see an injection of designs. Seems to be ~495 themes, ported to
various webapps. Upon review, I can with confidence say this is a merchant
peddling his wares. Caveat emptor.

i'm curious what advantage would Autotheme present over using ? is it an 
offline html editor that needs to be installed locally, or a remote 
server? a WordPress plugin? a PHP-based app that operates outside of 
WordPress?

how would I explain to my users that Autotheme is something better than 
doing it themselves through 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Designing_Themes_for_Public_Release? is it free?

I'm curious, are other people seeing double postings on all of the threads
recently?

I see one from the original author, then the exact same message follows from
the following address: *Mark Harwood <wpdevelop@ozgreg.com>

*Any ideas? Just curious if I'm the only one seeing this or not.

I got the same thing for 3 or 4 different threads. Actually, I found it 
stranger that I got the double postings after about 2 days of complete 
silence on the list.

The lists were silent because they were down.  Unfortunately this  
coincided with Matt being away at SXSW, so it went unfixed for about  
36 hours.  I submitted a ticket to TextDrive, and they brought the  
lists back up and said that it was processing the old messages.  The  
duplicates could be a combination of people double posting or some  
artifact of the system being down.  The latter would be my main  
guess.  'course if this message shows up twice, we'll know that  
something else is up.

Hello,

I want to introduce myself. I am looking to contribute to Wordpress
primarily in testing and quality reporting. I will be volunteering at least
5 hours starting this week and every week until I say otherwise.

I am one of the two person QA team for Flock. I have the great pleasure of
working with Eli Goldberg. Oh, I don't like the the term QA -- I don't
assure quality, I report on the quality to influence the stakeholders to
improve the quality. I have about five years relevant experience mostly in
enterprise solutions. For 4 years I was with IBM on a High Availability,
Down System DB2 Advanced Support team.

I think Wordpress is the premiere blogging platform, and open source is an
important value proposition to me. I am also a great fan of Matt Mullenweg
;-) I My contribution so far has only been in promoting Wordpress. Most
recently on Gerv Markham's blog, but my second comment has not yet been
approved by Gerv.
http://www.cocomment.com/comment/33028

I don't like public speaking, but I have gotten up at two conferences and
made sure Wordpress was in the context. Both were recorded ;-)

Hi Jefte,

Actually, I resell some of a designer's themes on my site (the 495 is 
just one designer), but the thousands of themes are on many other sites, 
sites of the theme designers.  Any AutoTheme runs on any AutoTheme 
supported platform, even if a theme designer markets it for a specific 
platform.  There are many designers in the PHP-Nuke, PostNuke and 
several shopping cart system  communities that create great free and 
commercial themes for AutoTheme.  Sorry to shake your confidence, but I 
am no merchant, the only ware that I peddle is AutoTheme, and at present 
I don't have a commercial offering for WordPress, it's all free and GPL.

Hi Phu,

I agree that WP has a capable theme system, but AutoTheme is infinitely 
more capable and I didn't develop it for WP.  I had already developed it 
and have had tons of requests to port it to WP.  It started out many 
years ago for PostNuke and PHP-Nuke and has grown as demand has 
dictated.  So now you have something for nothing.  As for the 
significant advantages, you would either need to read about it and use 
it, or I can briefly outline maybe 5% of the advantages:

1.  You can easily theme any page on your WP site with no PHP, just thru 
a WYSIWYG editor.
- users don't have to worry about PHP or even the guts/functions of WP, 
just HTML and add some comments that act as AutoTheme tags
2. Extensive Admin interface to configure and control all aspects of 
every theme (block placement, what templates are used for what and when, 
etc.)
3. Instead of a side bar with multiple pieces (links, pages, categories) 
they are individual blocks that can be controlled via a GUI admin and 
placed anywhere.
4. Many Extras (plugins that do a variety of things), i.e.:
- Ability to create and use a "printer friendly" theme for every page in 
your site and add a link to it on pages.
- program a certain theme to be shown during certain periods of the day 
(6pm - 6am)  another (6am - 6pm) etc
- program certain themes for certain dates or date ranges (a summer 
theme during the summer or a Christmas theme on Christas, show a random 
theme, etc.)
- Custom site entry pages
- Transition or ad pages that can be programed to be shown on load of 
certain WP pages every X number of times, etc.

It's a choice.  It doesn't replace the current PHP themes.  You can use 
one or the other or both.

If anyone is interested, I can assist with testing or explanations.  
Have an open mind and try something that you may end up liking.

Thanks!
-Shawn

Hi Steve,

Sorry, I just replied to another email that explains some of the 
benefits.  AutoTheme actually runs the pre-created or user created HTML 
themes and allows the configuration of all aspects of the display / 
editing of the HTML via the WordPress admin interface.  It is written in 
PHP and is uploaded to a WordPress site.

I would be glad to give a demonstration/introductory presentation if 
someone has suggestions on how to accomplish this online.

Also, I would be happy to give everyone access to the admin of my 
wordpress demo site as well if you wish.  I just installed it and need 
to find a good theme and then I can send you a link/credentials.

Thanks!
-Shawn

Suspicously all the "double postings" have the following in them:

- -------------------- m2f --------------------

WPG2 Forums (http://wpg2.ozgreg.com/forums/)

- -------------------- m2f --------------------

And come from the same server - http://wpg2.ozgreg.com/forums/

Someone is reposting posts back to the lists!

Thankfully it seems to have stopped

Given the sporadic lag in between such posts, it would be wise to assume
this was spam. It forged senders' addresses to get past moderation and used
identical content for  disguise. The forger was not even wise enough to
strip off the appended footer. It must the price of having decent PageRank
in the archives.

Given that they came in a burst, I'd say it was much more likely that a
misconfigured, or temporarily malfunctioning mail server remailed them. I've
seen this happen a lot when a server is used to collect mail from a POP
account. Server sees that the message is addressed to an address that's not
on its domain (the list address in this case) and "helpfully" sends it out
again.

Often happens with a badly set up Microsoft Small Business Server. It's
great fun when the original recipients of a mailing get hundreds of copies
of the same message.

That's a possibility too, I agree.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/10/server_bug_cripples_dublin_law_firms/

"The problem was attributed to an improper server configuration, causing
five servers to send out more than half a million emails to Dublin
solicitors. The deluge of mail originated with a publishing company's email
marketing message, which was sent to solicitors. When some solicitors
attempted to reply to the mail, a fault in the solicitors' configuration of
Microsoft Small Business Server sent the original email to their entire
email database tens of thousands of times."


Best wishes,

Roy

Message-ID: <20060316092644.57211.qmail@web54508.mail.yahoo.com>

I think that adding pages to the loop maybe is done
easiest by not using the loop but using a custom query
using the wpdb class. Or are there better solutions?

About having pages in the rss feed also, I'm a bit at
loss. Is there any other option besides altering the
different feed.php pages. It would be a lot nicer if I
could do this through a plugin.

Any suggestions appreciated.

A filter on the 'posts_where' hook should be able to do it -- just
strip out the "AND post_type = 'post'" condition.

This is untested, but something like:

	function show_pages_in_loop($where) {
		return str_replace("post_type = 'post' AND ", '', $where);
	}
	add_filter('posts_where', 'show_pages_in_loop');

I can't remember what version post_type was introduced in, but you
might need to chage post_status instead, with (e.g.):

	function show_pages_in_loop($where) {
	 	return str_replace(" AND post_status != 'static'", '', $where);
	}

That does indeed work for both problems. Tnx. My
mistake was that I thought there needed to be
query_vars in the wp_query.

I think he just mis-configured Mail2Forum (http://www.mail2forum.com/ 
wiki/Main_Page).  It grabs the messages out of a POP account and  
posts them into phpBB.  It can also forward the message on to another  
email address after posting.

And any specific additions to the core that do not abstract Wordpress
away form its generalized purpose will probably be added to the core.
(basically any additions that really should be plugins will stay that
way).

Ouch,  http://wordpress.org/search/roadmap does not find it, even after I
added  "Roadmap" to http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation .

I search on Tester, test, QA, and documentation, and none of the searches
find anything?!

What is an estimate when 2.1 will be? example Q4 2006.

And an estimate on 2.5 will be?

Is Severity="enhancement", the correct way for me to identify what are new
planned features for 2.1 ? Any way for me to identify roughly when they are
planned to be implemented, what are the highest risk, or most "interesting"
items?

Search on wp.org has been broken since the move to the new server/setup 
that roughly coincided with the release of WP2.0.

No idea when it'll be fixed, even though it's a Decidedly Known Issue(TM).

Lloyd -

You might want to get on the wp-testers list, as that's likely more 
appropriate for some of this discussion (QA topics, testing, etc.).  I'm 
sure Matt & others will be glad to have a tester on-board.

As for the question of a roadmap, timeline, etc., god only knows.  2.0 was 
the closest to having defined 'goals', but imho development is very 'fluid'. 
Certainly a lot is bugfixing or enhancement to existing feature areas.  New 
feature areas seem to spring into existance either from particular demand, 
or a particular coder wanting to try something out.  Again, imho. ;)

Hi David, thank you. Yes, I am on the testers list as well, and have posted
my tester questions there, though reading a little in the mailing list
archives. I see a lot of rich discussion about testing and quality on this
list as well ;-)

Fantastic!

For testing to be successful (and also to encourage more participants in
other roles in the community), we need to know where we have been, where we
are, and have estimates on where we are going and when.

Assuming development continues at its current pace, I would imagine we 
stop adding big features in early May.

>> What are the goals?

There were a couple of things from 2.0 roadmap that didn't make the cut:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_1.6

Of these I think a few are worth pursuing:

* XML import/export
* Better uploading functionality
* Link manager / Bookmark overhaul
* WYSIWYG enhancements, spell checking and autosave
* Backend design improvements from Shuttle
* Update checking for WP, plugins, and themes
* Better contextual documentation

Last version we took submissions through the Codex, simply because it 
was a lower barrier to entry and didn't clutter Trac.

Message-ID: <441A5784.70708@jamietalbot.com>

Hi,

Having get_currentuserinfo() as pluggable is nice, but what if I actually want to get the current
user info during plugin setup, without redefining it myself?  The existing function is good for
my purpose, but I need to get current user info before the 'locale' filter is applied for the first
time.  This can potentially occur in another plugin's call load_plugin_textdomain, for example in a
constructor, before pluggable_functions.php is included.

I could alternatively add the locale filter in later, and set it to a really low priority so it runs
last, but get_locale only runs filtered once, after which time it just returns the existing
locale...  I put up a ticket for this a while ago[1], thinking it was only a small issue, but it has
since become pretty important to me.

Cheers,

Jamie.

Hey, that's an idea- you mean that in #wordpress, a bot would announce
when SVN was committed, when a trac ticket was entered? How frequent
are those events? I could really see the value of a bot announcing when
someone posted to trac, forums, whatnot. Like a rss feed for the
channel. But on the other hand, if it was very frequent, it'd just
become noise.

Message-ID: <512061b90603171302s71ba415fn4fe0622df00ca1b8@mail.gmail.com>

David suggested that localization globals be wrapped into a global
class or associative array on this ticket:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2568

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

I understand the idea that putting all of them into one associative
array would cut several global arrays down to one but the extent of
change and the possible extent of widespread plugin breakage gives me
a reason to pause.

I'm not trying to call you out on this, David, becuase I'm all in
favor of this in general and would be willing to go through and write
a patch to do this. I just want to get the general consensus on the
matter first.

Best,

Abhay

This brings up an important point, one which will be repeated until
the end of time.

Plugin loading time is not the time to execute code. It is the time to
define functions and add actions/filters for later execution.

The reason for this is simple and it will not be argued here: the
program is not completely loaded until after the plugins and pluggable
functions are loaded. Refer to wp-settings.php to see which hooks
happen where.

Most plugins shouldn't actually do anything until init or later.

There are exceptions.

Offhand, that looks okay to me.  I'd like to run it by the wp-polyglots 
list before commit though.

Sure, I can appreciate the logic of that and I agree in the vast majority of cases.

Yeah, I've almost memorised it I think!  Red Alt's X-Ref is a fantastic programming aid which I'm
referring to constantly.  My question was kind of rhetorical - you can't do guarantee the order in
which plugins are registered, can you? (What would people's thoughts be on allowing this?)

> Most plugins shouldn't actually do anything until init or later.
> 
> There are exceptions.

In this case however, I'm dynamically setting the locale based on the current user's preference.
Because the locale filter is only executed the first time get_locale is called, other localised
plugins can potentially cause get_locale to run unfiltered before I register it.

In fact, allowing get_locale to re-run locale filters would allow me to register the filter in the
setup and then cause the locale to be re-evaluated when my own load_plugin_textdomain call runs in
init.  This would be after pluggable_functions has loaded and all would be well.  Of course, there
is the potential that a plugin's high priority locale filter could trump another's, but at least
then it's not a lottery based on which one is registered first.

Cheers,

Jamie.

The old globals could be kept around for backward compat, like we did
with $tablecomments; etc.

I was also thinking of using a class instead of an associative array,
perhaps integrated into gettext. It might be useful to have methods
and things. An object is just more general than an associative array.

Anyone can submit a patch.  Just don't get depressed if it doesn't  
get put into core.  After adding a patch, add the keyword "has-patch"  
to the ticket and maybe "needs-testing" if you think there may be  
server-related or browser-related issues.  You can also put up 2nd- 
opinion if it is a feature addition or if you are unsure that your  
way of fixing the bug was best.

If it's a big patch that'll require a lot of work, it might be good  
to get some other opinions before starting... just so you don't end  
up wasting a lot of time going in the wrong direction.

I'm fine with the patching process itself, and with using Subversion and 
whatnot, I just didn't know whether or not it was kosher to just go 
ahead and submit them without "authorisation", for want of a better word.

Don't forget to accept the ticket if you're going to write a patch for it.

Message-ID: <49542.80.176.82.74.1142808930.squirrel@postlin.smo.uhi.ac.uk>

Hi there,

I've just ported my LDAP plugin to WP 2.0.2 but I found a problem. The
plugin includes a file which defines a constant. However, I've found that
on some passes of the plugin file, which override wp_login, the constant
isn't defined so it doesn't work.

The only solution is to define the constant in the plugin file.

Is there any reason why require_once wouldn't work in a plugin file, some
of the time but works others?

I worked all the time in WP 1.2 - 1.5

thanks,

Alistair

Message-ID: <49543.80.176.82.74.1142809191.squirrel@postlin.smo.uhi.ac.uk>

In WP 2.0.2 I've found the plugin editor to be unusable. It's great until
there's an error in the file and then it never updates. It even stops the
entire blog from working if it's a core plugin for authentication.

e.g. I can edit the file using the plugin editor fine but if there's an
error - i.e. I tried to add a call to add_options_page, which doesn't work
in 2.0.2 and from then on the editor wouldn't update the file, even when I
removed that line. It always complained about function not defined, even
although the call was removed using the editor.

The only solution is to shell into the box and edit the file manually with
vi! Even then, there's a whole load of changes get deleted by the plugin
editor.

Is this a browser issue or is it something to do with the plugin editor?

thanks,

Alistair

Subject: [wp-hackers] get_template function
Message-ID: <441DEE25.80507@gmail.com>

Hi,

I've added a new template to my theme to allow a sidebar on both sides. 
But while I was adding it, I thought the <?php include (TEMPLATEPATH . 
'/mytemplate.php'); ?> method is a bit clunky, and thought a better way 
would be the following:

function get_template($name) {
	if ( file_exists( TEMPLATEPATH . '/' . $name . '.php') )
		load_template( TEMPLATEPATH . '/' . $name . '.php');
	else{
		if ( file_exists( ABSPATH . 'wp-content/themes/default/' . $name . 
'.php') )
			load_template( ABSPATH . 'wp-content/themes/default/' . $name . '.php');
	}
}

Then change get_header() et al to:

function get_header() {
	get_template('header');
}

This would give a much nicer way to include user-defined templates, and 
avoid nasty errors when something is not right.

Comments?

I realize it's in the current functions too, but is there a good
reason to fall back on the default theme if the file isn't found? I
mean, as an end-user, I don't have a perception that the default theme
is any different than any other theme, so it's pretty unexpected
behaviour. (Maybe I deleted 'sidebar.php' because I decided that I
didn't want a sidebar at all?)

So my vote goes for something like:

	function get_template($type) {
		if ( $template = get_query_template($type) )
			load_template($template);
	}


Either way it'd be good to use get_query_template(), so we get the
"{$type}_template" filters that are already used everywhere else.

-1, this would introduce possibly the largest backwards compatiblity
break in the history of all software, I'd estimate around 80-90% of
themes would stop working with a change like this, the reason that the
current behavior exists is so that a theme developer does not have to
write 20 files to get a simple theme working. I think the behavior is
perfectly fine as it is.

As for using one function to load all the files, I'm indifferent.

Really? Just to be clear, this function would have no impact on the
way the template loader falls back to index.php if the query templates
are missing.

Only header.php, footer.php, sidebar.php, comments.php and
comments-popup.php are loaded in this way, and I've never seen a theme
missing the first two, at least.

Still, that's why I asked if there was a reason. :P

If backward compatibility is an issue, perhaps a variable could be added 
to control this - something that could be set in a plugin or the 
functions.php for the theme.

I've got empty sidebar.php, header.php and footer.php files in my theme 
just to keep the default theme items from showing up where they aren't 
wanted. I don't see the current situation as a good thing.

Why would they show up unless you specifically requested them?   
Either your theme has a sidebar, and you call it, or it doesn't and  
you don't.

Message-ID: <a2ce2a0e0603200643r18e96698m166dfa52aaaf098@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

New guy here :)...

I am very interested in porting WordPress to PostgreSQL. I poked
around on the net a bit and found a *very* outdate port[1] and a forum
thread from a few years ago[2] on this topic. From what I can tell
there is no current progress on porting WP to PostgreSQL which leads
me to have a few questions.

Is there currently an effort (or a plan) to get WP working with post?

If yes where can I find out more about it and help?

If not, are you guys (the devs) interested in collaborating with me to
get WP working on top of post?

I have been using WP for a while and have been very happy with it
aside from the fact that I have to run MySQL soley for WP. Everything
else I run I use with PostgreSQL. Since I am new to WP dev, are there
any special guidelines or anything I should be aware of before diving
in. I will wait for some responses before going any further for now.
Please let me know what you all think.

Thanks,

Matt

I too am only a lurker here but I would be very interested in allowing WP to
use postgres.
I have looked into it a bit and found that they are using a db layer (a
modified ezSQL) that should already allow them to use postgres without too
much problem.
The main hurdle I see is that the database schema has some mysqlism that we
would need to work around. enums for instance, but i think triggers could
take care of that for us.

But I suppose that is all a bit premature without first hearing from the
devs.. =)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Cruft-free categories in 2.x?
Message-ID: <7c94a5850603201410h469541b8w9ba8aa39ee29303@mail.gmail.com>

Like many on this list, I decided to take the upgrade plunge to the
2.x branch after the latest security updates. In doing so, I've run
into some of the issues that Alex King describes at
http://www.alexking.org/blog/2006/03/13/changes-in-wp-20/.

I've found workarounds for most of the issues, but my white whale is
how to coax the new rewrite rules into not requiring /category before
all my %category% permalinks. Based on the documentation I've read,
the following plugin code should do the trick, but doesn't. I'm
clearly missing some crucial piece of the puzzle. Anyone out there who
can shed some insight?

function category_rewrite_cleanup() {
	global $wp_rewrite;
	global $wp_query;

	//load the rewrite rules
		$swap = $wp_rewrite->wp_rewrite_rules();
	
	//generate the "official" category rules
		$cat_perm = $wp_rewrite->get_category_permastruct();
		$cat_rules = $wp_rewrite->generate_rewrite_rules($cat_perm);
		
	//remove the official rules from the swap	
		foreach ($cat_rules as $key=>$value) {
			unset($swap[$key]);
		}
	
	//define my rules
		$my_rule['(.+?)/?$'] = 'index.php?category_name=$matches[1]';
	
	//add them to the swap
		$swap = array_merge($swap,$my_rule);
			
	//reset the rules with the swap value
		$wp_rewrite->rules = $swap;

	//set the category structure
		$wp_rewrite->category_structure = '/%category%';

	//set verbose rules	
		$wp_rewrite->use_verbose_rules = true;
}


// Hook in.
     add_filter('init', 'category_rewrite_cleanup');

Many thanks,
Stewart

enums will be going away in 2.1.  We eliminated many of them when we 
removed the linkcategories table.  There are a couple more to go.

One approach is to transform WP's queries into a syntax appropriate to 
the target DB.  This is done on the fly via a custom wpdb.php.  Someone 
did this with sqlite.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2317


 > But I suppose that is all a bit premature without first hearing from the
 > devs.. =)

We've been slowly massaging our SQL into more portable forms.  Patches 
to this end are gladly accepted.  There are some fixes in that sqlite 
patch that I'd like to work in.  As for supporting multiple DBs, I'd 
like to start by encouraging the approach above.  Provide a custom 
wpdb.php that translates WP's queries into the necessary form.  This 
will become easier as we get rid of enums and the like.

As for query cleanup, let's do this:

* Remove the remaning enums.  Anyone want to tackle this?  We need to 
provide upgrade code and go through the source looking for those places 
affected by the change.  The main enums remaining are the *_status 
fields.  The can be changed to varchars.  link_visible, autoload, and 
option_can_override can be changed to bools (tinyints).  There might be 
some plugin compatibility problems with changing link_visible to a 
tinyint instead of a string.  Need to see how many plugins check 
link_visible.  I think option_can_override is dead.  We might be able to 
remove it entirely.  I don't think any plugins use autoload directly, so 
we should be able to change it without breaking plugins.

* General cleanups.  Make sure values are quoted, etc. Don't provide a 
value for auto-incremented IDs. There are some fixes like this in the 
sqlite patch that should be incorporated into core.  A separate patch 
for those would be nice.

At this point it's unlikely that we'll officially support any other 
databases besides MySQL becuse (a) doing so is a lot harder than just 
swapping out ezSQL and (b) it increases the testing and support costs 
quite a bit.

That said, as Ryan indicated we are making improvements to the schema 
and such that may incidentally help out people porting WP to alternative 
databases.

What's the matter with defining the constant elsewhere, or even in 
wp-config?

Nothing comes to mind immediately. If you pointed to the specific code 
maybe other folks could take a look at it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] add_action for XML-RPC
Message-ID: <5ec14d0603210138k98adb8ay1d9ce139e3960fea@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy all,
  This is my first post to the list, so I hope I don't offend anyone. 
I've written a couple plugins for WP so far (Auto Links & Edit n Place
at http://www.headzoo.com) and I'm working on a third one now that
uses the built in XML-RPC class (not wp_xmlrpc_server, but the parent
class).

  What I'm wondering is if anyone else thinks it would be a good idea
to create action hook for registering plugin functions with WP's
XML-RPC class?

  Right now my plugin needs all of the WP's functions, variables,
constants, etc. So I send request straight to the index.php script,
let WP set everything up, and then it catches any incoming
$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA with the `init` filter.  If it thinks the POST is
for the plugin, it takes it, otherwise lets WP go back to doing it's
thing.

  This is a hack that could be avoided if I could just register
functions with the built in XML-RPC class.  Using something like
add_action('xmlrpc-add', $myCallBackFunction);.

  Obviously the popularity of XML-RPC keeps growing, and I can see
more and more developers wanting something like this.  Just my opinion
though.

Can you not use the xmlrpc_methods filter called in
http://trac.wordpress.org/file/branches/2.0/xmlrpc.php line 135 to add
your own methods to the builtin XML-RPC server?

This looks like it might help you achieve what you want.

An action here as well that was designed for you to just add to rather
than filter the method list could be an improvement but the existing
filter probably already provides all that is needed.

sorry, maybe I was unclear but that's what I did and that's where the
problem lies. Sometimes when the plugin is called, the define in wp-config
is defined, sometimes it's not. The only way to get the plugin to work is
to define it locally in the plugin file.

wp-config doesn't work all the time. It's as if it isn't in the includes
when the plugin is called.

I already tried using it like this:

add_filter('xmlrpc_methods', array('myplug.ping' => 'myplug_ping'));
function myplug_ping($args) {
	return $args;
}

And it didn't do anything.  The only place that "xmlrpc_methods" is
even mentioned in the docs is under Skippy's page, and there it's only
listed, no description.

Even if that did work, and I'm doing something wrong, it seems the
filter is important/nice enough to get mentioned in the codex, along
with a proper description for using it.

This code is wrong - you have to give add_filter a function name to call
and it will pass you the variable to filter in that function.

I think you want something more like this fragment

---
add_filter('xmlrpc_methods', 'myplug_register_functions');

function myplug_register_functions($xmlrpc_methods) {
    $my_funcs = array('myplug.ping' => 'myplug_ping');
    return array_merge($xmlrpc_methods,$my_funcs);
}

function myplug_ping($args) {
    return $args;
}

I have added xmlrpc_methods to the list of filters on the Plugin API page.

Well of course you were right.  Good thing I brought this up, cause it
keeps my plugin from feeling "hackish", and instead it's using defined
APIs within WordPress.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <B318A17C-F2B0-436C-BAB0-54018CD245D3@yournextbroker.com>

Hey guys,

So I'm trying to make a plugin that does not show categories with  
less than X posts. (or list the top categories by count)  The only  
filter I can find to muck with is list_cats and the exlusion list,  
however, it's just giving an array of string names for the  
categories.  No easy way to access the count.

Any ideas on how to accomplish this plugin?  Are there some good  
filters I'm missing out on?

No easy way in the current release, but I've written a patch [1] which
should enable filtered access to the cats. It's been sitting
commit-less for a while now, any chance of a push, Ryan?

We need a uniform approach for pages, cats, and bookmarks for both the 
list and dropdown functions.  We probably need to pass $args to the 
filter as well.  Plugins need to be aware that the lists might be sorted 
into a hierarchy with children after parents.  Don't break the sort.

Message-ID: <64c81f720603211218k3577dfa8i8c7c9f7cacaff7f2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

Could you suggest how to find out what the post ID is while in header?
E.g., how to display a post ID (if this is a single post page) within
HTML comments.

I have registered a plugin action with add_action( 'wp-head',
'display_link' ) and now need to find the post ID from within that
function:

function display_link() {
  if ( is_single() ) echo "<!-- Post ID = " . $post->ID . " -->\n";
}

Of course, there's no post ID echoed.

Adding the post loop to this function (which I am not sure is the
right thing to do) just leads to error messages about unexpected '}'.

Thanks,
Uldis

$posts[0] should have what you're looking for.

Don't we have API for this stuff? Something like get_queried_object()?
When was that introduced? I've fallen into Trunk and I can't get out.

You forgot to global $post, and like Andy said, you want to pull your
data out of the $posts[0] object.

I'm 99% sure this was in 2.0 at least, I know I used it for a few
things at work, and I'm 99% sure that the boss didn't install trunk,
he'd be lost if I mentioned subversion.

<?php if ( is_single() ) echo $posts[0]->ID; ?>

OR

<?php if ( is_single() ) { $post = $posts[0]; the_ID(); } ?>

The second one will let you use most "in the loop" functions  
prematurely (i.e. before the loop) and doesn't, in my experience,  
interfere with the loop.  But if all you need to do is echo the ID,  
I'd go with the first one.

If wp-config.php weren't included, you'd have no database access.   
Without that, you wouldn't know what plugins are active.  wp- 
config.php must be included.

If you can give us some sample code and the expected/actual  
behaviors, we can take a look at it.

Just writing to put my hat in the ring...

I've got pretty extensive experience with adoDB and I'm already
investigating a WPmu-to-Oracle port for my primary employer.

If anyone else is interested in a more complete abstraction, not just
mod's for one DB in particular; count me in.

The other advantage of adoDB that isn't mentioned in the wiki page is
that if you have the extension compiled in it will automatically use
the functions from that and is pretty damn fast :)
PEAR's DB abstraction sucks. Sorry to any PEAR fans reading this ;p

cheers,
Andrew.

What is y'all's motivation for wanting to use postgres? The usual 
motivation for using one DBMS over another is features, which is obviously 
not the motivation in this case since you are porting an exisitng 
application. There may be some performance differences as well, but unless 
there are some notable places where there are exponential or at least 
geometric differences in time or space complexity, I can't imagine that 
the effort to port to another SQL dialect would be cheaper than throwing 
hardware at the deployment.

Also you mention that adoDB is fast... it might be fast compared to other 
abstraction layers, but afaik all abstraction layers are slower than 
direct SQL. Or does it have some super fancy caching these days? Much 
fancier than the DBMS' caching systems?

Just curious... :-)

My reason for wanting to support Oracle is because there are a LOT of
universities already heavily invested in Oracle due to it being
required for Blackboard, the leading (*cough - i wish it wasn't true*)
Learning Management System. Seeing as Blackboard just bought their
only competition, this is going to increase over time.
As for postgres, I think those guys are in a similar boat -- if you
can't get MySQL installed for whatever reason, you work with what you
have.

What kind of cheapo servers is your company using and where can I get some?! :D
I can't speak for anyone else, but my day job doesn't have MySQL
because our DBA team are all Oracle and that's just the way it is.
Currently the estimate for a 99.xx% uptime MySQL box in our internal
data centre with support and nightly backup is AU$10,000 per year...
yeah, PER YEAR! :-O
There's no way it would cost $10,000 of my time to port WP. Even if it
did, it's a one time investment with periodic upgrades, not the same
fee every year.

Absolutely -- lowest common denominator SQL (eg: pure ANSI 92) is aka
'slowest common denominator' -- you can't take advantage of anything
offered outside that standard. *However*, the adoDB object has a
lovely method called Prepare($sql); which does nothing on MySQL 4.x.
If you're using just about anything else though (M$SQL, Oracle,
Postgre, probably MySQL5) this will automagically take advantage of
the query caching offered by your target DB.

The best bit of the above query caching features (and other related
functions) is that you can call them for any target DB and adoDB will
know what to use and where. I get very good results using this with
Oracle and would almost go so far as to say any DB offering query
caching would slay MySQL for pure content output under heavy load.
(working under the pretence that PHP level cahcing isn't also
happening, which it should be). However, that's too hard to prove and
far too debatable, so I'm going to walk away from that statement ;)

To reiterate  -- abstraction is often referred to as a pretty term for
_slow_. Working off the php version of adoDB is fine, but the C
extension is truly awesome.
Also, adoDB 4.8 implements the Active Record pattern in a very similar
manner to the intentions of the Zend Framework (although Zend haven't
released that code yet afaik); although it actually is a more feature
rich implementation.

Sorry, I hit send too early:
Also, adoDB 4.8 implements the Active Record pattern in a very similar
manner to the intentions of the Zend Framework (although Zend haven't
released that code yet afaik); although it actually is a more feature
rich implementation. That alone would be a godsend for many plugin developers...

class Product extends ADODB_Active_Record {}
$p = new Product();
$p.name = 'Wicked Worpdress T-Shirt';
$p.price = '$15.00';
$p.save();

^ nothing to port there :D

Okay okay, I was assuming there was an existing mySQL service... :)

Regarding the query caching, a couple questions.. [1] mySQL has query 
caching, so why doesn't it benefit from what you are talking about? [2] 
how does the abstraction layer take advantage of query caching beyond what 
the DBMS does at its end anyway? Do some systems have more elaborate APIs 
beyond just associating queries with results?

There's get_queried_object() and get_queried_object_id(), yeah. Also,
in core, we now have get_the_ID().

anyway :)

$adodb->CacheExecute( ) || $adodb->CacheSelectLimit( )  -- fetches

they require bind var's. MySQL 4.x doesn't support binds, does it?

hm i still don't get this bit... those two functions use the DBMS' query 
caching? How? It seems like it would make more sense that it is adoDB's 
own subsystem that is independent of the DBMS.

You asked me "how does the abstraction layer take advantage of query
caching beyond what the DBMS does at its end anyway?"  -- by writing
the resultset to file so it doesn't need to make a connection in the
first place :)
adoDB has two levels of caching -- the abstracted implementation of
each DB's query cache and it's own file based recordset cache.

I know their naming scheme has a long and storied history, but it's
generally referred to as "Postgres" not "Postgre". The full name is
pronounced "Postgress Cue Ell".

I'd consider myself a "postgres guy" because I like it and want to  
see WP work well with it, but that doesn't mean In understand how it  
handles query cacheing. :)

Don't know too much about the internals of postgres query caching but I do
know that I like the end result. =)

I am in a similar boat as the others as far as why I want to use postgres,
it's what we have at the office. We are phasing mysql completely out and
wordpress its one of the last applications left. I could go on about why I
like postgres over mysql but as mentioned that's kinda pointless in this
case as I'm not developing against it.

But I can speak to this, "I can't imagine that the effort to port to another
SQL dialect would be cheaper than throwing hardware at the deployment."
It's back to the standards thing. It's not so much that we would be porting
to another specific SQL dialect, but instead be porting to a portable SQL
dialect.
Port once use on many different systems, Oracle, Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL.
Then let your customers choose what to run your application on. It's a nice
feature that allows for more flexibility, it's not really a performance
thing (although I'm sure some would argue otherwise=] ).

I would be very willing to contribute some time to this effort, by writing
SQL, PHP code and/or documentation.

Sweet, that's two of us onboard for an adoDB port... or do you have
reasons to recommend PEAR:DB instead?

Anyone else willing to put their hand up?

Once we've got willing parties sorted, I guess we should use a codex
page to split up the work? I'm new to distributed programming without
face-to-face contact; hopefully someone can drop in with a bit of
guidence at this point; please?  :D

looking forward to finally contributing something meaningful,
Andrew.

The one warning I'll give you about adding adoDB to WP at all, is the
speed. Well over half of the CPU time that WP spends while loading
pages are actually PHP's lexical scanner parsing the thousands of line
of source code which are included on every page and compiling the byte
code from that. Imagine adding adodb to that, without a byte code
cache, the load of adodb, and you've just made WP a server killer ;-)

That said, if I had to choose, adodb is the lesser of the two evils.
Nearly anything from PEAR would be met with huge reistance from me, I
find their code despicable and their coding standards horrendous ;-)

Greeting all,

Long time reader first time poster.

I have a client that want to allow users to signup for comments and  
allow access to create their own post entries. I know I can turn on  
the option to allow sometime who registers to also create content  
(content author). After discussing this with the client though they  
do not want the user to need to access the WP admin section to create  
these post. In other words they would like a simple form hosted  
external that will allow the person to sign-on and create the post.

So my question to the group is. Is this possible without too much  
effort? Has anyone done something like this before that I can  
possibly use as a starting point?

Thanks for all possible replies.

Paul

You could do it in a variety of ways, including coding a form that used
XML-RPC to make the posts...

Thanks. None of these worked for me with WP 1.5 though. I see in the
source that the functions get_queried_object() and
get_queried_object_id() are defined, but I can't call them from the
plugin.

$posts[0] worked fine.

Also need to get author's ID if the requested page is author's page.
Probably get_queried_object_id() would have helped. Since it does not
work for me, I did this instead:

global $wp_query;
$user_id = $wp_query->get('author');

Is that a correct way to get author's ID?
Or is there a better one?

Thanks,
Uldis

get_query_var('author') is better.

Message-ID: <64c81f720603241159q15b265cemfc259d2b2bb5a1e1@mail.gmail.com>

Does WP_Rewrite require .htaccess to be writeable (or a manual
copy/paste into .htaccess) in order for rewrite rules to work and
changes to be made to them?

Question for both WP 1.5 and WP 2.0 in case if there are differences.

Why I am asking is this: how many actions is a user ready to perform
in order to get a plugin running properly?  Copy file into /plugins
(1); enable a plugin (2) - OK. But in case if the .htaccess is not yet
writeable, will a user go and bother to change it? Will he/she always
have the access rights to do the change?

Thanks,
Uldis

What kind of plugin requires changes to the .htaccess file? That's one 
serious plugin...

Before 2.0, it was the only way. There are a number of plugins which
add their own rewrite rules, including a variety of tagging plugins
for tag/xxx/ permalinks, feedburner, etc.

I recently ported my Tasks Pro/Tasks software (the code is ~25,000  
lines, excluding language files and external libraries like ADOdb,  
etc.) to ADOdb, the page load time changed by ~.02 seconds (without  
using the compiled extension). For me, gaining PostgreSQL and MS SQL  
server support for .02 seconds per page was a pretty good trade off.

Also, not all ADOdb code is loaded at run time - only (well, mostly)  
the stuff you need.

Howdy,
  As a WP plugin developer I've been dying for something like this for
a long time.  The codex is painfully lacking in API documentation. 
It's real bad.  The benefit of using DocBlocks is having something
like phpDocumentor do all the API documentation for you.

  While the codex might be fine for casual developers, something like
auto generated API documentation would be a God send for more serious
developers.  Heck, half the packages in the Pear repository don't even
have standard documentation, just the auto generated docs created by
phpDocumentor.  The reason is, that's enough for someone who knows
what they're doing.

  The generated documentation is HTML, it can be added to the search
on wordpress.org, and it will be indexed by search engines.

  Anyone here who doesn't want to use @param and @return might not
understand what those tags meant for.  They don't do anything, and
aren't meant to be human readable.  They are meant for parsers like
phpDocumentor.  Without them the generated API documentation would be
worthless.

  Regardless of what is decided, the WordPress code needs inline
documentation in a bad way.  Some of the developers should be ashamed
of themselves for the lack of commenting.  One of the first rules of
programming is comment, and comment often.  There's no real excuse for
skipping comments.

  If you guys decide to push forward with the DocBlock style of
commenting, I'd be more than happy to help.

Does a developer need to code anything differently if he wants
WP_Rewrite to work in WP 2.0 without having a write access to
.htaccess?

P.S. Thanks a lot for answering my somewhat simple questions.

Best,

Hi guys

I've never posted here before, so my apologies if this is not on-topic for
this list...

I spent a few minutes tonight hacking WordPress to allow users to choose the
size of thumbnails created in the inline uploader.  Nothing big, maybe about
20 lines of code.  The default thumbnail size just wasn't doing it for me.

A diff is attached.  I'd love to get feedback and learn how to get changes
mainlined into WP.

Thanks

I think it might be better to implement this feature as a plugin not as a
patch.

To expand a little bit further on Denis'  one-liner.
Your attachment got scrubbed out.
File a ticket on TRAC and hash it out over there, you can even
successfully attach your patch there too!

And yes, I'd agree, this should totally be in core.

I don't. I don't think most people care about their thumbnail size, or
find the default one acceptable. It's easily done as a plugin.

Check the forums.
There are more people there posting about thumbnails than inline
spelling. And one is a few lines. The other is ....

I, for one, HATE the default thumbnail size.  It's too small to be
useful for anything other than "Click this for the non-gimped full size
version".  +1 for a mode going into the core.

I glanced at the plugin API and didn't see any hooks for image uploading.
Also didn't seen anything in inline-upload.php that would suggest a hook is
available.  Is there something about the plugin API I'm not getting?

I will submit my diff to trac, thanks.

There isn't a hook in there for you to use... correct.  Currently,  
you'd have to replace the entire inline-uploading.php file using the  
'uploading_iframe_src' filter hook.

Interesting...

The most irritating thing about the file uploads for me is that it
does not make use of PHP's FTP functions to perform the final
'upload'. The consequence of this is that all files uploaded through
Wordpress end up owned by 'web', thus trashing any quotas I may set
for a particular FTP user. I suspect this would be a potential
nightmare for anyone who manages a shared server with virtual hosts.

Perhaps a plugin (or the amendment to the core functionality) should
address this too?

BTW, this is my first post to this list - am a great fan of WP apart
from this niggle.

The uploading code is missing some potential hooks.  You should probably 
be able to filter the $override parameter sent to wp_handle_upload() 
from inline-uploading.php.  It's surprising that for how pluggable 
wp_handle_upload() is, that it doesn't handle the thumbnail creation itself.

Of course, the entire thumbnail creation code should be pluggable, since 
one might have a way (via plugin) to create a thumbnail of videos or 
other formats.  Even a standard thumbnail image for things like PDFs 
might be handy.

So when considering what hooks to add to the thumbnail code and how, 
keep more flexibility in mind than "let people change the thumbnail size".

Also, it seems like (I could be reading this wrong) if the thumbnail 
creation in wp_create_thumbnail() experiences an error, then the error 
is returned as text.  The code that accepts the results of 
wp_create_thumbnail() stuffs the result into the attachment record, 
regardless of whether it succeeded.  Oops.

Hi again

Not to be too pathetic but I created a login on the support forums this
morning, and now about four hours later, Trac still won't accept my login!
Anyone know what the problem might be?

Thanks everyone for  your feedback.  I'm excited to get into Trac and see
what others have done about this / get my code seen.

You're best bet is to contact Matt directly. Nobody but Matt on this
list can do much but say "yeah, I've been hearing about this for two
days on IRC as well," which would be my next point.

Most thumbnail creation errors are fatal errors, i.e. out of memory,
so any inserts after that would fail.

Just talked to Matt... he's aware.  There was a recent server move  
that has caused some problems.

My normal comment reviewing flow is to go to the
"/wp-admin/edit-comments.php"
page so that I can see the full text of all the comments taht have
been posted since I last logged in.

Following this, I click on "view post" links for each of the comments
and proceed to reply to the comments.

It would be MUCH easier if each comment had either of (in order of preference):

a) An AJAXified form to reply to each comment
b) A link to reply to the comment (not the same as View Post - but
maybe View Post can be changed to View This Comment instead)

Plan a) would significantly reduce the time taken to reply to the
comments, since there will be less back-and-forthing between the posts
and the edit-comments.php page.


Thank you,
Carthik.

Not sure if this is related, but I'd like to throw this in as well...I'd
like to see at least the post title and an excerpt of the thing so I can get
the context of the comment. I don't turn comments off on my blog, and often
I get legitimate comments months after the fact, but if they are in
moderation, I find myself having to look at the post, then go back to
moderation to deal with it there.  It's not a good workflow. :)

Yeah.  It made sense and would have helped plugin writers, so it was put to

I find it rather manageable if one hovers over the "view" link and looks at
the post slug (commonly in the browser's status bar). It still requires
familiarity with the slugs. I agree that, without context, it is difficult
to judge if purging is justified. Some comments tend to be inane
one-liners.

Message-ID: <200603300632.k2U6WWQ7000673@post.webmailer.de>

I'm using a plugin to perform the pinging for new posts. I'm wondering
whether there is a hook or filter that I can use to inform the plugin when a
post with an edited timestamp (future post) has been published, so that the
post can be pinged?

 

Thank you for your help.

The info they supply means nothing to me - and it's probably not enough.
Is there any way for a shared hosted blog to find this stuff out in

I haven't followed any of your links, but I do see a "Content-type"

Well, now that I've roped myself into this...

Disable plugins? Change themes? Somebody put some wrong code in there somewhere.

Well, it seems to be ok without the absolute URI, just the second
'Content-type: php; charset=UTF-8' thing is too much, but it's not in
the Header. Shouldn't be a problem to delete this line in the theme.

There are several places in the WordPress code (at least the 2.0 branch)
where the header is given with a lowercase 't' in it.  But as someone
pointed out, the header names are case-insensitive.

    wp-rss.php
    wp-rdf.php
    wp-links-opml.php
    wp-rss2.php
    wp-commentsrss2.php
    wp-atom.php
    wp-admin/admin-header.php

I think the conversation should change to: What is the best way to  
create and maintain inline documentation if it won't be checked into  
core.

A number of features currently in/or being added to WP were initially  
rejected when first proposed. This is a good idea, and it shouldn't  
be stopped cold because Matt doesn't like it right off the bat.

This is still an OS project - if the community is willing to support  
and create this documentation, it should be included. I'd bet a  
nickel that Matt might be willing to reconsider if presented with a  
full set of documentation. Of course, the flip side to this is that  
if the documentation isn't completed, it's easy for it to be dismissed.

My recommendation is that the documentation effort be revived,  
perhaps on a local branch that someone is willing to maintain, and  
that the finished documentation be presented to WP for consideration  
when it is complete.

Cheers,

Thanks for reminding of the obvious, Alex.

That sounds like an insult. It's not.

It seems we keep forgetting this, and being reminded of it on occasion
is a good thing. If the project goes forward but isn't added to the core
that doesn't mean it's worthless to pursue. We're just talking about the
addition of comments to PHP files here. Really, how hard is it to merge
documentation into a new release(1)?

1. That was rhetorical.

I'm personally of the opinion that keeping a separate copy of the 
complete source code is going to be inefficient and troublesome to 
maintain. Is there not some better way?

Perhaps a carefully thought out wiki sort of thing?

But yes, +1 for having documentation and another +1 for keeping it 
outside of core.

I was going to suggest that the focus shift to making a php.net-style
function reference -- completing [Owen's at RedAlt][1], say -- which
would help serve the same documentation need. It doesn't suffer from
the merging troubles that a branch might.

It's incredibly easy to extract function definitions etc. from PHP
files[^2], so the thing could auto-update from SVN. It could track
changes within functions between versions. At the very least, it could
ping the maintainers/interested people when functions are added or
removed -- it helps keep itself up to date. And it's trivial to extend
to include a comment system, link to tutorials or examples, detail
deprecated usage etc.

It's possible to generate the inline documention from the function
reference and insert it into the source code -- it's actually easier
than it is to extract the same data from the inline docs, IMO -- so
you end up in the same place, but from the opposite direction.

There's also no more need to restrict the documentation to @param and
@return, since docblocks can be written to order.

I thought of this,and can't think of any automated way of syncing with
svn while preserving the comments on a local copy. I spent a half hour
researching if svn can be taught to ignore comments when updating the
checked out code, but came short of useful info.

If you, or indeed anyone else knows of or can devise a way to "svn up"
while ignoring local comments, please list it out here. Once we have
that, we can set up a doc repo for the source, and get phpdoc and
whatever else running off of that repo.

I had mentioned something similar earlier in this thread, that be a
different repository to develop docs on, and once it is mature enough,
to merge the docs with the main tree. But I got no response.

I can handle the maintanence of the doc repo, or at least hand someone
the keys to the setup once I have it set up on my server. I foresee
multiple key-holders to avoid bottlenecks.

Thanks for bringing this up again, Alex,

Carthik.

Simple, store the comments elsewhere linked to the source files when
needed by a helper tool. Much like Owen did with his site

Nothing new to add, other than +1 for inline docs.
I'll happily volunteer to contribute to inline docs and have made an
account at Owen's existing function reference[1] (though I am unable
to find a way of editing existing entries...)

Inline docs are a great developer reference (esp. for plugin authors,
as previously noted) and I think Owen's front end for the WP
function's list is a great way to make these doc's more consumable by
the masses.
