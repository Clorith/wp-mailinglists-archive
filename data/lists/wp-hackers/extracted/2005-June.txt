Sounds like a GWA problem. Seems to have been addressed in the forums.

That's a strange conclusion to draw...
The reporter of the problem specifically says 

    "I do not think they are running on that"

I would say so too, but:
- I have a known dislike of Google and for me to leap in and condemn GWA 
would/could be seen as the wrong response.
- The fact the post has 'Security' in it's title means it will get a lot 
of views so posts into that thread need to be considered responses IMO. 
I would not edit that word from the title unless it really was a daft post.

Even if the answer would be what I could have posted, if it has been 
given proper scutiny by this list then that is a better solution. Which 
is not to have a pop at anyone but forum history says these things get 
out of hand quite quickly which is why I posted here.
Thanks for looking though :)

This is an excellent post... especially the diagram which is very
useful. Could something be done for more consistency with the text

Fair enough. The thread seems to have developed since I wrote that

I suspect the main problem pointed out by Michel may have more to do with
the way WordPress generates excerpts.

I think one of the problems is that the WordPress filter system is made 
to work with some kind of HTML-without-<p>-tag format. It is assumed 
that paragraphs are added at the end of the process, just before 
showing it on the page. This is what causes trouble, because Markdown, 
Textile, and most other syntaxes just can't dissociate that step from 
the other transformation step that lead to HTML.

I think the best way to solve this in the long run is to draw a line in 
the text flow chart and say: "Above that line, it's the user custom 
syntax; below that line it's some HTML *with paragraph tags*". On that 
line there is a filter that makes the translation from a user syntax to 
HTML. (By default the user syntax is that HTML-without-<p>-tag format 
and the filter on the line is `wpautop`.) On the HTML side, other 
filters can balance tags at will, filter undesirable tags, strip all of 
them, add/remove/change attributes and make smart quotes. But this must 
not be done before the syntax has been converted to HTML -- and I mean 
HTML *with paragraphs* -- by `wpautop` or another filter.

Because WordPress does not work that way, Markdown has to change it to 
work like that with some nasty tricks, or else some syntax elements do 
not work correctly.

* * *

So here comes my suggestions.

First, there are some holes in the hooks available. There is a 
`get_the_excerpt` hook, but no `get_the_content` and no 
`get_the_title`. I think they should be added.

Second, reserve `get_the_*` for static filters. This means the filter 
do not take into account anything relating to the incoming request. For 
example, this would include `wautop`, but not the Google hilite filter. 
Dynamic filters would say in `the_*` hooks. This will add some 
coherence and symmetry to the text flow and will allow plugins like 
[PreFormatted][1] to coexist peacefully with Google hilite and PHPExec.

  [1]: http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-preformatted

Third, specify a priority level inside `get_the_*` hook which will be 
the line of separation between user syntax and HTML. The priority 
number should leave some space before and after it for user syntax 
add-ons from other plugins. (I'm thinking about [LazyImageLayout][2] 
here.)

  [2]: http://www.davidseah.com/archives/2004/09/26/lzil02/


I'm still not sure about what could be done about `balanceTags` in 
`*_save_pre` hooks and about comment filters.

First of all... this is not a bug, a complain or anything similar...  
this is just a feature request that I feel that it is important.

One of wordpress biggest advantages are a) the plugin system and b)  
the theme/template system... but I feel that there are at least 3  
templates missing:

a) wp-login
b) wp-register
c) wp-admin/profile

The way I see this is that wordpress has the option to only let  
registered users to post comments... but if you turn on this option  
when they try to register, login or change their profile it feel like  
leaving the website since all this pages have the look and feel of  
the wp-admin area and not the rest of the common-user-frontend.

I really don't know how hard it is to convert this pages to the  
template system... I know that editing them by hand it isn't so hard  
but it would completely loose the point of having a template system  
and not being able to use it on this pages.

I'm willing to help on this if anyone can give me a hint on how to  
accomplish this.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Media RSS
Message-ID: <429EA5CB.1020201@typhoon.org>

I'm new to this list, so my apologies if this has been discussed 
previously, but nothing turned up in my searches.

I need Media RSS support for my Wordpress blog.  I was planning on 
coding it myself since I didn't see anyone who seemed to be working on 
it, but I decided to check here because there's a couple of questions I had:

1) Is anyone working on this now?  Last thing I can find is Matt talking 
about it on his blog back in December.  I'd be happy to contribute or 
just wait to avoid duplication of efforts.
2) This can't be developed as a plugin.  The hooks aren't there.  This 
leads me to ask, if I was go about coding this, would anyone be 
interested in me writing the code to add the necessary hooks and then 
writing Media RSS as a plugin to that?  Or would people prefer I wrote a 
patch that does Media RSS?  Would anyone accept the patch into 
mainstream if I wrote it?
3) In terms of the other metadata Media RSS supports, is anyone 
interested in added fields to the post page (i.e., poster graphic for a 
video) to accomplish this, or should it all be done through custom 
fields (not very user friendly, but low-impact)?
4) I have another requirement which most decidedly probably should be 
written as a plugin, but it brings up a more interesting overarching 
point that I"m going to bring up to the Media RSS group as well.  My 
postings come in through XMLRPC from an external video provider.  They 
do the transcoding for me, so thusly I have 6 media files per blog post 
(thus the need for Media RSS support).  However, this is all hidden 
behind a javascript which allows the user to determine which embedded 
player to use.  Other than throwing some kind of links hidden by CSS or 
something in there or posting some XML into the page that I can then 
fold into the Media RSS somehow, I can't think of another way to 
accomplish this other than extending the XMLRPC API.  I've not done this 
before or even investigated it.  What's the precedent for this?  Would I 
be able to get any support in the community for this, for scenarios such 
as this when we're posting media blog posts from an external provider 
via XMLRPC?

OK, I think that's enough questions for now. :)

Most of that is above me, but this I can handle. You could make a plugin 
that adds certain meta fields by default to the post screen. I the 
relevant hook would be... "edit_form_advanced" and "simple_edit_form" in 
which you could hook and then output custom input elements for 
predetermined media types.

You'll also need to then hook the publish_post, edit_post, save_post, 
and a few other hooks to catch that data and actually update/insert it.

There are, however, tons of examples of this kinda of behavior - just 
browse some other plugins.

As it turns out, no it wouldn't :) I've fixed some bugs in my code, so
the attached code should now work. Just tack it on to the end of
/extend/themes/theme-scroll.js. It still doesn't smoothScroll to the
hashed theme, but that's a deliberate design decision and my rationale
still stands from my previous email.

In case you missed it ...
A post to the forums about possible wp / mysql performance -
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/35279 - has lead to the first plugin 
that I know of which can help in tracking down 'slowness'. Up to now 
it's been a case of "deactivate everything" and "email your host" so 
something that helps us do some diagnosis in-house must be a good thing. 
It is certainly something I will be asking users to implement at 
appropriate times - comments ? improvements ? thoughts ?

This works much better. The only problem now is (at least on my firefox) 
it bumps the top of your browser window to the start of the iframe when 
you load the page. Is there anyway to prevent that?

Also, is there any way to highlight links as people scroll manually 
through the iframe?

Quick fix for this, just add the following lines at the bottom of the
autoScrollToTheme function:

//don't let the browser scroll down to the top of the iframe
window.scrollTo(0,0);

> Also, is there any way to highlight links as people scroll manually
> through the iframe?

This'll take a bit more thinking about. I don't have a solution right
now, but it certainly should be possible to hang something on the
iframe's scroll event.

The Themes page looks good, but about 50px of the next theme to the 
right overlaps (IE 6 and FF 1.04 Win).  Is this correct?  Seems to me 
that only one theme should show at a time, so there should either be 
more space in between themes in the iframe or the iframe should be thinner.

Must ask, and hate to burst your bubble if you didn't know, but according to 
the website they're no longer accepting mentor organizations, so have you 
heard any word from them?

Anyone else have comments about my other questions?  Matt?  I'd like 
some feedback before I start hacking away at this.  I'd hate to spend 10 
hours writing up a Media RSS patch one way to find out the WP team 
doesn't like my approach and they're just going to re-implement it.  
Seems like that would be a waste of everyone's time.  Thoughts?

I am not sure that I can see great merits in this. Why it is 
Google-specific? Is
it linked to from your main page? Your robots.txt does appear to help:

User-agent: *
Disallow:

The request for daily updates of all permanent entries will not be honoured by
SE's. The content is static. Also, why not use a scripts like narchives.php to
list all entries? I went as far as extending mine
(http://www.schestowitz.com/Weblog/narchives.php~) so that it lists the
excerpts, which are otherwise unused outside feeds.

Where did you get this information from?
http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html still says,

"Do you want to be a mentoring organization (it isn't too late!)"

Which would imply they're still open to montering organisations.

Roy, Google Sitemaps was just released yesterday. They are allowing
people to submit feeds of all their web pages to help Google crawl and
index their websites faster.

Find more info on it at: https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/

I have an overview of the protocol at:

This reached Slashdot only 20 minutes ago. You were ahead of everybody, 
I guess
so well done.

I suspect that it's very practical in domains which have one consistent CMS.
Since only about 20% of my pages are in WordPress, I am worried that such XML
will distract Google et al. from the real site map.

Maybe I'm mistaken, but as far as I can see this only handles posts
and not "pages" in WP.

For those of you wanting to participate in Google's program, WordPress 
will not be an official mentoring project this year but when making your 
application you can still enter "Google" or "Other" as your organization 
and still do a WordPress project.

Feel free to contact me offlist if you have any ideas you want to flesh 
out or get advice on before submitting your application. Best of luck to 
everyone who enters.

I'll be sending this mail individually to the people who contacted me 
directly, so if you may get this twice.

I installed it and it's a nice thing. I would prefer if wordpress had 
this option buildin, because there might be outher plugins in the 
wp_footer-action that are querying the database (e.g. BAstats). Another 
thing is, that not all slowness comes from database-access. Maybe 
wordpress could measure the time every plugin is active or something in 
its diagnostics mode ...

btw: two things on the queries:
1. to get all static pages there is first a query to find out what the 
id, title and name of those are and then there is one query per 'page' 
to get its content. Is this really neccessary?

2. same with normal postings ... they are being pulled out of the 
database (with every information available) and then there is a query 
for each post to find out its meta-data which should already be there ...

Much potential to speed up some things and finally get wordpress to 
output the frontpage in under 300 ms on a duron 1600 with 512 MB ram :-)

Okay, this has been developed now. There's three more functions that
need to be added to the theme-scroll.js file. I actually made some
other ammendments to highlightLink() to increase performance, so it
would be easiest to just replace the entire theme-scroll.js file with
the one I've attached.

Support:
* Firefox works almost fine. If you scroll too fast, some links aren't
highlighted as Firefox isn't very good at firing scroll event.
* IE: works perfectly. However IE did seem to choke with a 'permission
denied' script error, until I removed the empty <script> element from
the HTML page (just below the 'Fix the FOUC' comment).
* Opera: works OK. Links are highlighted, but there's a slight pause
when Opera highlights a new link, as (presumably) Opera isn't very
good at executing highlightLink().
* Other browers: untested. If someone could test with Safari, that'd
be brilliant.

Notes:
* The script relies on all themes inside the iframe being the same width.

Enjoy :)

After a very quick cursory review, the most notable needed change is
your setInterval() call. You should pass it a function reference as
the first parameter, which can be easily achieved using a closure.

Passing it a string is an old an undesired method and is a performance
concern due to the need for re-compilation of the code at runtime
(akin to the horrors of eval()).

So, change:

ss_INTERVAL = setInterval('ss_scrollWindow('+ss_stepsize+','+destx+',"'+anchor+'")',10);

to:

function getFnScrollRef(ss, dx, a) { return function() {
ss_scrollWindow(ss, dx, a); }; }
ss_INTERVAL = setInterval(getFnScrollRef(ss_stepsize, destx, anchor),10);

If I have more time later I can provide a more thorough review as well
as Safari testing.

Subject: [wp-hackers] post id in custom template
Message-ID: <42A2F40D.4040903@copperleaf.org>

I have a plugin that modifies "the_content" with a registered content 
filter. I'd like to be able to have the part being modified be defined 
with an optional template file but need to know the post id and misc 
data in the template page. Let me try and illustrate.

mytemplatefile.php:

<div>
    the post id is <?php echo $post-ID; ?><br />
    my tag key is <?php echo $mymatches; ?><br />
</div>


in the content filter, I do something like:

preg_replace_callback('/<!--\s*mytag(.*)-->/iU', callback, $content);

function callback($mymatches)
{
    ob_start();
    include('mytemplatefile.php');
    $buf =ob_get_content();
    ob_end_clean();
    return $buf; 
}

What is the best way to pass in the post id as well as $mymatches to the 
template file? I know I can use the global $post to get the post id, but 
is that the best way? Or would I be better off defining a function in 
the mytemplatefile.php. Something like:

<?php
function mytemplatefile($postid, $mymatches){
?>
<div>
    the post id is <?php echo $postid; ?><br />
    my tag key is <?php echo $mymatches; ?><br />
</div>
<?php } ?>

TIA

Thanks, Brad. That wasn't my code, but is fixed anyway in the attached file. 

The Opera jolt is still there, anyone got any idea for a workaround?

For getting the post ID in a the_content filter, I've just either 
declared $id global and used that, or declared $post global and used 
$post->ID  Using $post is better if you need other stuff as well, 
because you can just "globalize" the $post object and be done with it.

Thanks to both of you! This code is currently live on WP.org and seems 
to be working pretty well.

I tried it out on Safari and it seems to be working sometimes but it's 
all doing the jump thing when you click the link.

On the topic of the table schemas for WordPress, could someone explain
to me why the posts has both a post_date and post_date_gmt field?

Having just the GMT time and an offset stored should be enough, or is
this for the case where you move from, say, Europe to USA and then
still want the posts to retain their local time? If so, then each post
ought to have a timezone associated with it. This would be cleaner and
more explicit.

Making a rule out of always dealing with timestamps as UTC is so much
better in the long run. Then only convert them into a local time on
display.

Having them as integers (what time() returns) is even better for it's
so easy to do calculations on integers --- much easier than processing
your string with regular expressions like in get_gmt_from_date() in
functions-formatting.php.

I think it is so that permalinks are actually permalinks, even if you
change the time offset.  If only UTC was stored, when you adjust the
time offset for DST, posts around midnight might have their permalink
changed to another date.

I've wanted to break the mold, too. If I had any style skills, I'd try to 
make a nice horizontal-scrolling theme, or one that shows posts in forward 
chrono order and scrolls to the bottom on load. But I don't. And if I had 
any sense of usability, I'd know better. :-)

Mike little has had his 3-column, light-weight layout for quite some time.
Thousands of people showed interest in it and he was even offered money 
to port
it to Blogger.

Well, BloggingPro's Gila might be interesting at 
http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2005/03/04/wordpress-theme-gila/

Head is one of the coolest themes out there:

The Indentification bands 3 and 4 column versions might be nice and 
different: http://www.eretzvaju.org/identification-bands

Relaxing Three Column 
http://clemens.orth.me.uk/2005/05/15/wordpress-theme-3-column-relaxation/ is 
a very nice looking and simple Theme - lots of potential and usage for this, 
especially with the image sidebar.

And I hope that the winners of the recent contest(s) will be top on the list 
for converting, if possible, since it should be an "honor" to be "approved" 
by WordPress.

Okay, for real this time. This is not for the faint.

I remember a passing thought from last night while browsing my iTunes 
library. Something about a three- or four-panel navbar at the top, either 
AJAX driven or loading the whole menu and using hide/show functions, that 
could drill down to any post, page, category or archive in several ways 
without leaving the home page. Then the main box, a single column below 
that, could be populated by AJAX when you click in the panels.

Here, I'll develop the idea with some examples:
Blog -> // The usual front page, with options in the second panel. Click 
Months:
Blog -> Months -> // Now the third panel lists the populated months. Click a 
month:
Blog -> Months -> Jan 2005 -> // Now the fourth panel lists the Jan 2005 
posts. Click one:
Blog -> Months -> Jan 2005 -> New Year // Now the main box shows the post.
Blog -> Categories -> // Obvious.
Blog -> Authors -> // Ditto.
Blog -> Sorts -> Length -> // Show shortest or longest posts
Blog -> Sorts -> Visits -> // Most visited, least visited posts
Blog -> Sorts -> Comments -> // You get the picture
Blog -> Sorts -> Alpha -> // I've never seen this done. Ever.
Blog -> Sorts -> Attachment size -> // Use your imagination
Blog -> Pages -> Alpha ->
Blog -> Pages -> Topic ->

Now, why do they all start with Blog? Drop the first panel if all you want 
is a blog. But look what you could do with four:
Pages -> Topics -> Travel ->
Pages -> Authors -> Andy ->
Pages -> Sorts -> Alpha ->
Photos -> Albums -> Summer Camp ->
Photos -> Tags -> Geek Dinners ->
Photos -> Sorts -> Aperture -> // Seriously, this could go ANYWHERE.
Wiki -> ???
Store -> ???

This is way out of the mold for blogs. It looks far more like a CMS, but 
isn't that a good line to blur? The panel can be as small as 80px high and 
still work. It can even be minimized into a single line or icon, leaving the 
blog looking like a regular blog if you like. Just without the sidebar. It 
should also degrade gracefully for non-JS users.

Now, WP is in no way optimized for this kind of selective content loading. 
It could be, but not by a theme alone. A very clever script could be devised 
to handle the AJAX requests independently of index.php, staying slim by 
require()ing only the necessary core files; Count My Clicks already does 
this to a degree. The same could also be accomplished with a lot of core 
redesign but it would have to be so thorough, it wouldn't be WordPress 
anymore. Or it would be 2.0  :-D

Sound like fun? This whole idea just occurred to me. Anyone is free to run 
with it. I am interested in working collaboratively on such a project so 
keep me in the loop, okay?

Andy

Message-ID: <6.2.3.3.2.20050611214125.01e7c970@localhost>

Greetings,

The majority of you would not be aware of the Wordpress Gallery2 
Plug-in project (http://wpg2.ozgreg.com/) that links the two products 
together via a series of embed'd G2 API calls..

One of the minor issues remaining is the management of users which 
are automatically synched between wordpress and Gallery2 via API calls.

It is the synching of users which is the subject of this email..

At present from what we can see, WP has two hooks we can utilise for 
user maintenance.

add_action('user_register')
add_action('password_reset')

Which are fine when a WP user registers / changes passwords, however 
if an admin maintains a user record we appear to have no hooks to 
ensuring that admin user maintenance is reflected in Gallery2

The option we are utilising is the add_action('admin_menu') which is 
less than ideal

Basically we need / are looking for hooks to directly trap the 
following events..

user creation -> add_action('user_register')
user maintenance ->  unknown
Admin User Creation -> unknown
Admin User Maintenance -> unknown

Thanks and I hope you can help
WPG2 Team.

Subject: [wp-hackers] User Permissions system overhaul
Message-ID: <ebe43d6805061106391225fe0e@mail.gmail.com>

I've been thinking about how WordPress manages user levels recently,
and I think at the moment there's certainly room for improvement.
Here's my ideas:

* As per Gabriel White's expert review [1], replace user level numbers
with names. At the moment, I'd have no idea at all what level 1, 2 or
3 meant without the codex handy. Going to 'user level 1', 'user level
2', 'author level 1' and so on at least gives me a better idea of what
each level is meant to represent.
* An advanced configuration panel for each user where I can select
(with checkboxes) exactly what this user is and isn't allowed to do.

In terms of implementation for the second point, I think adding a
(user_permissions text) field to wp_users, which is a space-seperated
list of permissions (e.g. 'write-page', 'edit-categories'). We could
then strpos() on this field to see if a user had a specific
permission. I suggest doing it this way because otherwise we'd find
the wp_users table bloated with columns, and every time a new bit of
the admin interface was added, everyone would have to modify the
structure of their DB.

Any thoughts on this?

My two pence.

In general this doesn't sound very user-friendly to me!

Too much configurability like this can make it very hard for the nieve user.
It also become very unwieldy and hard to understand who has what permissions.

I would have thought that a better system would be to define a set of classes of user
e.g.
  Commenter, Author, Editor, Admin (There may be others I haven't thought of)

Where each type of user has specific functionality and they stack up nicely so that each user type gets the abilities
of the lower user types.  We could then have some plugin hooks to allow plugins to be developed to provide any finer
grained control that an end user might require - e.g. authors being tied to particular categories.

I do agree that you should not have to go to the codex to understand what abilities a particular level of user will
have - except maybe for the finer details.

I think it is important to strike a balance between understandability and fine-grained control - if we want
fine-grained control then maybe we need to add the idea of user groups to wordpress and it is the group rather than
the indiviual user that has the type of fine-grained control that David is suggesting.

I've been dealing with this in a program I'm working on for my boss - and there are so many different opinions about the permissions system it's crazy. I went with a combination of simple and granular - by making an additional table to store the permissions, and by starting with a very limited set of permissions. I think that having 'levels' of permissions is restrictive, and that it's better in the long run to do it in a piecemeal way. However, I think that in the case of WordPress, with the system already set up, it would be enough to simply define the numbers from within the program. I would also like a way to just input the level, text field or drop-down, instead of the way it is now.

So, yeah, I think the best first step would be to change the input to a drop-down, and define the numbers on that drop-down with the terms used in the codex.

Agreed on both points. In fact, I can't see how we'll avoid a user  
system overhaul as the package gets more popular. People are really  
starting to find a lot of good uses for WordPress as both a blog and  
as a CMS, and the user permissions area really holds it back as a CMS  
(IMHO).

I think that having a default set of "user groups" that correlate to  
the current 'levels' would be the best way to transition. However,  
this new user system would have an additional secondary nav called  
"User Group Permission". In that tab -- *should you want to * -- you  
could redefine what each user group did. In fact, you could even  
remove or add user groups.

This would allow for the easiest switch over (as it stays, by  
default, the same) while giving people that extra ability to  
customize the permissions. Additionally, it would be a hell of a lot  
easier to figure out exactly what "Author Level 0" can do compared to  
"Author Level 1" if the permissions are right there, and not buried  
in the code/codex.

Finally, the user editing page *definitely* needs some dropdown menus  
for changing user group -- and the ability to "mass change" (select  
multiple user group dropdowns at once). Having to click an author up  
and down is a nice idea, but it gets REALLY tiresome for more than 5  
users (and *no* phpMyAdmin is not an option.)

A nice idea. Denis' list of groups seem like a good place to start.

I think that's definitely a good set of default User Roles.  As the 
founder/administrator of a collaborative blog with over 15 users 
(excluding admin), I would definetely benefit from something like this.

I would like to see the ability to assign a user more than one role, and 
REALLY like to see the ability to add/update/remove permissions for 
different tasks to new or existing roles.

For example:
======
Administrator: [system]
* Can do everything [system]
* Can manage plugins
* Can edit plugin files
* Can change blog-wide options
* Can manage All users
==
Editor:
* Can create drafts
* Can edit any draft
* Can publish any draft
* Can edit any published post
* Can manage Categories
* Can leave unmoderated comments [provided by spam plugin?]
Author:
* Can create drafts
* Can edit own drafts
* Can publish own drafts
* Can edit own published post
* Can leave unmoderated comments [provided by spam plugin?]
Contributor:
* Can create drafts
* Can edit own drafts (ie cannot edit own published posts)
==

Moderator: [advanced]
* Can edit comments on all published posts
* Can mark comments as Spam  [provided by spam plugin?]
* Can unmark comments as Spam  [provided by spam plugin?]
==
Registered User: [system]
* Can leave comments
* Can edit own comments (?)
==
Guest: [system]
* Can leave comments
==
Sysop: [advanced]
* Can manage All users
==
Theme Tweaker: [advanced]
* Can edit theme files
==
File Uploader: [advanced]
* Can upload files
==
Link Manager: [advanced]
* Can create links
* Can edit links
==
Spam Manager: [advanced] [provided by spam plugin?]
* Can manage Blacklist [provided by spam plugin?]
* Can manage Whitelist [provided by spam plugin?]
======

Where I say "edit" that also includes "delete".

Where I say [system] that means that you couldn't delete these roles, 
but you could delete other roles.

Where I say [advanced] these are non-standard user roles that will 
remain hidden until the option "Enable Advanced User Permissions 
Management" is turned on.

Each Role should have a master "Enabled" switch, which will turn that 
role on and off, and as such, users with a disabled role do not gain the 
permissions that role would normally grant.

So, instead of having the option "Users must be registered and logged in 
to comment", just disable the guest role.  Heck, you could make the 
former option an alias to the latter, or even better, an alias to the 
"can leave comments" permission on the Guest role.

Also, you would need an option like:

* Newly registered users gain these roles:
   [disabled][x] Registered User   (ie, they will always get this role)
             [ ] ...
             [ ] ...
             [ ] other roles

When editing roles, you would probably want to categorise the different 
'user tasks' into 'user task categories" "Administration", "Posting", 
"Commenting", "Links", "Uploading".

With respect to plugins, plugins should be able to add new 'user tasks', 
new 'user task categories', and maybe even new default advanced roles.

.
.
.


Anyway, that's my vision for a truly extensible user permissions 
overhaul. I believe if implemented correctly, WP's user system will 
rival other CMSs.  I hope you share this vision!

I'm putting a copy of this vision here:

Good to hear, I was worried that this kind of advanced permission
system wasn't going to be very popular, but I think there'd be enough
demand for it.

I think this may be complicating things a bit too much. I think,
instead of having to create a role you'd inevitable only assign to one
person, you should be able to configure exactly what a user can and
cannot do, and give them a title (e.g., you could configure it so that
they can moderate comments, and give them the title 'Spam Manager').

Again, I don't see that this would provide a great benefit. I can't
see this being used much, and it would be quite confusing IMO.

I think wording it something along the lines of two options:

[ ] Anyone can register as a registered user
[ ] You have to be a registered user in order to comment.

I don't think there'd be a great demand for allowing users to register
themselves as anything other than registered users.

How would this serve any purpose?

Keep in mind that WP is primarily weblogging software. WP isn't trying
to capture the CMS market. I think a lot of what you've suggested
would be over the head of the average WP user. I think that the
following would be sufficient:

* Change user levels system to user roles; use roles proposed by Denis
de Bernardy.
* Allow advanced configuration of individual users: checkboxes to say
what this user can and cannot do.
* Allow titles to be given to users.

Okay, but can we try to keep the discussion on this page? Things could
easily get out of hand otherwise.

You can overwrite all of the registration and authentication functions

Message-ID: <42ADF299.8050600@mullenweg.com>

At its heart WordPress is a writing application. I think much of the 
project's success can be attributed to the fact that it does a fairly 
good job at getting out of your way and letting user's focus on creating 
and editing their content.

Their are two notable gaps in WordPress here: WYSIWYG support, 
auto-save, and spell checking. There are plugins for both of these, but 
they tend to not integrate as well as they could and the spelling 
checkers aren't usually compatible with the rich editors.

The first step is deciding on a WYSIWYG editor, since that's the 
foundation we're going to have to work with for spelling and auto-save. 
I've started a list of the open source ones I could find here:

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WYSIWYG

Feel free to expand the list. We can also capture the discussion from 
this list to that page for later reference.

My out-of-the-box favorite is WidgEditor, but it seems to have a lot of 
bugs left to work out. The most active seems to be FCKeditor.

I believe they all support that. Also now that we can have per-user 
options thanks to the usermeta system people can choose what type of 
editing environment they prefer and not effect other users on the system.

Well since I created the WYSIWYG plugin and I tried most of the  
editors there are a few comments that I might be able to make bout  
each of them:

- TinyMCE: Very active project and they are already working on  
support for Safari. Since it has an option for invisible items such  
as comments it shoul be very straightforward to add support for the  
WP "next page" buttons. (probably without even touching the sourcecode).

FCKeditor: Also under heavy development but it seems like it is a  
little more buggy and for some reason users had more trouble with it  
than tinyMCE.

HtmlArea: This project is dead... they even closed the sourceforge  
project page.

widgEditor: This is a very basic editor and could be extended to  
accomplish what Matt wants. It isn't exactly under development and  
was created mostrly to be used as an editor for the comments form.

Xinha: I haven't try this one really. It is a branch of htmlarea and  
seems to be very improved but still they haven't made an official  
release.

With my plugin I made an htmlArea version, an FCKeditor version and  
currently the latest version is based on TinyMCE.

The reasons are that tinyMCE creates the best code, it actually  
cleans the code making sure it only contains the allowed tags and I  
it is very easy to integrate.

There are tons of plugins that work with tinyMCE (spelling, html  
tidy, html import from word, etc).

There is only one thing that I don't like... the "official" plugin  
for adding images it is not opensource... there are others which are  
pretty good (my plugin includes one that has the upload option and I  
even respect WP permissions) but the fact that they have commercial  
plugins makes me thing that at any moment the whole thing can turn  
bad just like it happened to htmlArea.

Just my two cents... and as always sorry if I made a few (or a lot)  
of mistakes with my english.

I like the idea of a rich editor, but what about support for automatic
markup formats like Markdown (etc.)?  Storing posts as plain text is a
good thing, IMO.

On the forums, image handling gets way more posts than this and right 
now WP pays lip-service it seems to images.
Can the Image Upload page either be improved and work properly, or can 
the bullet be bitten and that part of the admin be removed or stripped 
down to the reality on offer ?

Just some thoughts :)

We can make it *a lot* easier to insert and format images once WYSIWYG 
is in place. I'm not saying it's the most-requested feature we have, but 
once we have that foundation we can accomplish a lot of things that 
people have been asking for.

If someone want to discuss alternate syntaxes, count me in.

Speaking of Markdown, there is a new version of the plugin that 
implements what I've discussed before and it gets things *almost* 
perfectly right. But what should be a simple 'add_filter' function call 
is taking 53 lines of code to work around the issues I pointed out 
before. And I have the feeling the next WordPress version will break it 
one way or another -- some workarounds are rather fragile and dependent 
on other filters being where they are now. I think this illustrate 
quite well the problem.

In case you are interested, the plugin is here:

Feel free to submit requests for additional filters or actions on the 
bug tracker, these are almost always implemented.

Apparently, "Far too few people use these for them to be included by default. "
Markdown and Textile have been removed from WordPress

No one said anything about taking support for that away. If anything 
with Michel's feedback we hope to improve it.

I'm not saying this is a bad development route to take, but if we add
WYSIWYG support, we'd have to drop the word 'semantic' from our
mission statement.

It isn't as easy as it seems. To make things less abstract, I think the 
problem can be summarized this way:

Q: Where can I put a Custom-Syntax-To-HTML filter in the text filter 
chain so that it works properly?
A: Nowhere. Not "nowhere where there is a hook" but really "nowhere at 
all."

This is a *design* issue; adding new filter hooks won't help much. What 
is needed is a change to the default WordPress text flow, in the order 
filters are run and the way some filters work to accomodate the new 
text flow. I thought this was pretty obvious from [my weblog entry 
about this][1] and [what I said before on this list][2].

Understanding and documenting the problem already took me much time and 
effort. Without a clear commitment to understand and solve it, I won't 
waste more time in explanations. So I ask: Is there someone willing to 
rethink the entire text flow in order to address this issue?

I agree, Text Control way better than the Markdown plugin alone. But it 
also has the same issues Markdown had prior all the "patch" work I have 
done.

It seems to me for a wysiwyg editor to be truly useful here, it's going 
to have to display after all the applicable filters have been processed 
and after applying the current theme (theme switchers make this more 
complicated). I have a plugin that does tag substitution at filter time 
and can do it differently depending on which is the current theme. If 
there is an editor that can do this (I assume heavy mods to any of them 
mention would be required), then I think we can still meet the 
"semantic" statement. This lead to the same discussion that have been 
had in the past <em> vs <i>, <strong> vs <b>, etc. in regards to 
buttons, etc.

If we need to display all the content after filters are applied, we're 
looking at maybe AJAX or something. Without rewriting filters in Javascript, 
there is little that we can do otherwise.

Message-ID: <42AF3DA0.5050509@cygnusinteractive.com>


I'm wondering if anyone is generating an XSPF document with WordPress?

     http://www.xspf.org/

I've started to hack on this a bit. So far I've got something working by 
starting with wp-rss2.php and creating wp-xspf.php, and editing it to 
output XSPF. I also had to add functions to 
wp-includes/feed-functions.php to check for an enclosure (is there code 
already to check if a post has an enclosure?) and added a function to 
output the enclosure's URL.

If any wp-hackers are interested in this, get it touch with me, I just 
started talking to Lucas Gonze about it as well...

Not that I can think of. Seems like a perfectly reasonable evolution  
for 1.6

And at the same time, you could add in the ability to pull just  
comments, tracks, or pings in each's respective group.

Chris' "Seperation Anxiety" plugin is a good start for this:
http://dev.wp-plugins.org/file/anxiety/trunk/cjd_anxiety.php

And I know Chris, Mark Jaquith and I collaborated on a slightly modified 
version, for which I cannot find the permalink...

http://txfx.net/files/wordpress/ping-track-comment-count.phps

Use as follows:

<?php comment_type_count('comment'); ?> Regular comments only
<?php comment_type_count('ping'); ?> Pings and Trackbacks combined
<?php comment_type_count('trackback'); ?> Trackbacks only
<?php comment_type_count('pingback'); ?> Pingbacks only
<?php comment_type_count('all'); ?> All types (default)

There is also <?php get_comment_type_count('all'); ?> which returns, 
instead of echoes (following standard WP convention).

Both can also take an optional post ID as a second argument.  By default 
it uses the ID of the current post in the loop.

The plugin uses a "smart" cache that'll populate itself the first time 
you use the function on a page load.  All subsequent requests will come 
from the cache and not use up any MySQL queries.

I'll put up a page for this later tonight:  it'll be under 
http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/

Thanks to Skippy for reminding me of this... someone will probably find 
this useful.

I read through your article and I think there are some incorrect 
assumptions.

1. Removing filters is a bad thing. It's not, that's why we have the 
function.
2. Balancetags is always enabled
3. We could make the_excerpt processing be filters (more hooks!)

Then you talk for several paragraphs about things that were fixed in 
1.5. 1.5 has been downloaded over 300,000 times, I think it's a safe 
baseline and many other plugins require it. All comment processing 
should happen before things are saved to the DB.

I would be happy to incorporate changes for the text flow to be more 
accomodating to alternate syntaxes, however besides changing how 
the_excerpt processes it's not clear to me what are some specific things 
we could do to make things easier.

No, it's not a bad thing. *Moving* filter elsewhere however can break 
other plugins. Like a previous version of PHP Markdown (1.0.1a) which 
was moving `wp_rel_nofollow` to `get_comment_text`. It was breaking any 
plugin trying to remove it since the filter wasn't at the same place 
anymore.

> 2. Balancetags is always enabled

The filter function is always called. But it does its work only if the 
"WordPress should correct invalidly nested XHTML automatically" 
checkbox is set.

> 3. We could make the_excerpt processing be filters (more hooks!)

Adding hooks may help make things more logical and symmetrical (see the 
dashed "holes" in the diagram), but it won't solve the issue by itself.

* * *

To illustrate the problem, let's say we write guidelines for those who 
want to implement an alternative syntax. The guideline could be 
summarized like this:

For Posts:

1.	Remove `wpautop` from `the_content` and `the_excerpt`.

2.	Add your custom Text-to-HTML filter in `the_content` and 
`get_the_excerpt`
	with priority 6 (so that it is the first filter).

3.	Remove `balance_tags` from `content_save_pre` and `excerpt_save_pre` 
since
	it may tamper with our custom syntax.

4.	If still useful after conversion from your custom syntax: Add 
`balance_tags`
	to `the_content` and `get_the_excerpt` with priority 8 (so that it is 
after
	your custom filter but before `wp_trim_excerpt`).

5.	Add a filter that will wrap text inside a `<p>` tag in 
`the_excerpt`, but
	only when said tag are missing. This is because `the_excerpt` must 
return
	text wrapped in paragraphs, but when it comes from the auto-generated
	trimmed post paragraphs tags are not present.

6.	Add a filter that will remove any `<p>` tag in `the_excerpt_rss`.
	This is because `the_excerpt_rss` must return text not wrapped in
	paragraphs while text coming from `get_the_excerpt` contain `<p>` tags
	once it has passed through custom filter added at step 2.

For Comments:

1.	Remove `wpautop` from `comment_text`.

2.	Add your custom Text-to-HTML filter to `pre_comment_content` at 
level 6
	(so that it is before all other filters that expect HTML).

3.	Find a way to make `wp_filter_kses` not strip `<p>` tags (and maybe 
other
	if needed). [...]

4.	If there is already some comments in the database which were saved in
	your custom format (because previously the filter was applied at 
display
	time), these comments still need to be filtered at display time. [...]


These guidelines reflect exactly what I have done for the Markdown 
plugin. (I left some implementation details in the last two points 
however.)

In my weblog entry, when I say in the first paragraph that "[the text 
flow] is very powerful but badly adapted to a writing syntax different 
from HTML", it relates to my experience with other applications. I 
haven't seen anything near this level of complexity in any other weblog 
or CMS software. In fact, many of them only need the plugin to tell 
them what function to use to do the filtering, they handle everything 
from there.

WordPress does not need to be "like the others", but it should be 
better than it is currently.

> Then you talk for several paragraphs about things that were fixed in

> baseline and many other plugins require it.

It hasn't much to do with WP 1.5. Previous versions of Markdown did 
filter the content at display time, so previous comments in the 
database are not saved in HTML, but in Markdown format, and still need 
to be filtered. (I'm talking about comments posted prior installing PHP 
Markdown 1.0.1b, not WordPress 1.5.)

> All comment processing should happen before things are saved to the DB.

Yet `wpautop` is still done at display time. ;-)

> accomodating to alternate syntaxes, however besides changing how

Changing `the_excerpt` could help, but what kind of change? I'm 
beginning to think that what would help the most is to put `wpautop` 
first in the chain everywhere: content, excerpts, comments. `wpautop` 
does something Markdown does: it adds paragraphs. But Markdown must 
also run before anything else. After such a change, it will then be 
possible to simply replace `wpautop` with another filter to handle 
custom syntax conversion to HTML without hassle. (I'm not arguing that 
it should run prior `balanceTags` however. Removing/moving this filter 
isn't really hard or complicated.)

(Explanation: Moving `wpautop` first in `get_the_excerpt` will bring 
the same issues Markdown had for excerpt and comments... which means 
WordPress will now need to address those issues itself, instead of 
plugins.)

Anyway, whatever change that simplifies the guidelines I wrote above is 
a step in the right direction. The ultimate improvement would be to 
provide a settable custom-format filter somewhere, WordPress handeling 
all the details by itself... but I think I'm dreaming. :-)

I don't think people will be using an alternative posting syntax AND 
wysiwyg. They both have the same goal -- to make writing blog posts 
easier and reduce cognitive friction -- so it really only makes sense to 
use one or the other.

Is this as easy as it seems ?
When my girls use Word, they literally do see what they will get. They 
can adjust margins, page size, orientation etc. So as part of also 
offering it, are we going to make textarea resizing part of the deal ? A 
a true 'print preview' ?
If the goal is to really offer an admin view that mirrors the published 
post then do we not need to ? And if we can't, should it then be 
included as there will be the inevitable "You say you've got it when you 
haven't"

I wouldn't say it's easy (to do right), otherwise we would have done it 
already.

It's more a visual formatting rather than full page layout. I don't 
think people will complain about this because it is pretty much what 
every system in the world does. Maybe later when our WYSIWYG is combined 
with touched will have the real ultimate interface. ;)

WYSIWYG composition (for those that want it), plus something like Matt 
Read's "Preview Drafts Plugin":
   http://mattread.com/projects/preview-drafts-plugin/
Should go a very long way toward giving people a better idea of how 
things will look when they click the "Publish" button.

I imagine an enterprising person could extend the plugin above to also 
provide a preview of the post using the print css, too.

Agreed. That wouldn't make much sense. My point is that the look and 
feel of the post is largely determined by the theme. A wysiwyg editor 
that displays the bold text in normal bold where the theme might 
actually be displaying bold text in large red text doesn't seem like it 
would help much. The fact that filters can add additional content to a 
post just widens the gap between what the post will really look like and 
what the wysiwyg editor displays. As someone already mentioned, 
processing the filters to update the wysiwyg display is not an easy task 
and may not even be worth the effort required. However getting an editor 
to display the theme's look seems reachable. (Statements like that are 
easy from the cheap seats.)

All that being said. Whatever solution that is chosen, it sounds like 
the goal would be for it to be swapped out with other editors as a 
plugin? With the fact that there are a number of plugins that "add" 
content to the post (ex. Exhibit), could we have some sort of standard 
javascript api that can allow plugins to do their thing regardless of 
the editor chosen? Functions like insertAtCursor(string), 
insertAtBeginning(string), getSelection(), replaceSelection(string), etc.

BTW, the preview drafts plugin that Matt Read wrote is pretty cool. 
Could something like that be integrated with the preview that we have at 
the bottom of the post screen so that it updates when the post is saved?

Or, since we are considering "editing in place" ideas. Why not also  
consider the option of simply creating a blank post in "private"  
status*, and then allowing for some kind of WYSIWYG editing on-the- 
fly of that page itself.

Something akin to < http://tool-man.org/examples/edit-in-place.html >  
would be interesting and then slap on some AJAX for saving the post  
as you go...

  * For those who don't know, Private posts show up on your blog just  
as if they are "Publish" posts, but only for you. Probably the best  
"previewing" option there is.

Some of the editors have an option where you can edit the CSS used to  
display the WYSIWYG form so you could actually make it look exactly  
like the theme.

There could be a standard use of CSS classes or something similar and  
we could have a script that grabs that info from the theme so it can  
be used with the editor.

That's a good thought.  FYI, I have a Drafts view and a Private view within 
my admin 'control panel' in the sidebar.  So I can actually preview posts 
within my site's 'framework' in either status mode.  Good when I'm writing 
10 page reviews, which a wysiwig editor still isn't going to preview for me 
properly. ;)

Also, someone mentioned that filters can change the text.  Yes, remember 
that.  Remember all the cool plugins that modify the content -- lord knows I 
have a few!  And in many cases, I have my plugins only set up hooks when not 
under the admin pages -- not sure if others do that as well, but if the 
editor is going to start previewing the_content, I'd want to adjust my 
plugins accordingly. :)

Have XUL and XAML ever been considered for the admin interface?

Firefox doesn't support XAML. IE doesn't support XUL. Safari, Opera,
Konqueror, OmniWeb and so on support neither. Is this really a
feasible option?

Besides, what advantages does it present?

Sure. The translation from one to the other will inevitably be programmed by
someone. After all, and technically, the idea behind XPCom is that a
xul2xaml (or other) transformation exists.

Obviously, xaml isn't 'official' standard. But it will be the de facto
standard, since MS reportedly -- and rightly -- has no plans to get serious
about XForms. So, 2 or 3 years after Avalon ships, I'd expect a browser that
cannot read xaml to be comparable to a word processor that cannot read a
word document today.

In such a context, using Xforms for the admin interface on grounds it is the
'real' standard would be silly. And the folks behind FF, Opera, Konqueror,
Omniweb and so on would be crazy not to support xaml in a way or another.

> Besides, what advantages does it present?

The built-in widgets supposedly make things easier, more modular and more
maintainable than a DHTML interface. In particular when it comes to creating
a rather complex Wysiwyg tool such as the one being discussed here. That is
not to say it shouldn't be done with DHTML. Just that is will likely be a
rather complex thing to do.

So that's a 'no' for feasibility at the moment then.

The point of standards is that they are independent of corporate 
entities, otherwise it is a proprietary technology belonging to said 
corporate.

It may well be that the other browser manufacturers cannot support XAML 
because it is MS's property (I don't know as I'm not following it's 
development, is XAML open?). Regardless, I advise maintaining support 
for open standards... they just seem far more aligned with the concept 
of open source software.

The advantage that a DHTML interface has is it can be built now and 
supported by most browsers invented in the last five years or so, in a 
way that can be supported by browsers yet to be invented. It doesn't 
have to look and feel exactly like one OS or the other, so long as it 
is consistent, easy to learn, and easy to use.

Terrence Wood.

My name is Max and I'm the developer of the just a few days ago  
founded "Spreeblick Verlag" - the first german publishing house  
dedicated to blogs. For now we have 5 blogs, e.g. http:// 
spreeblick.com - on of the most popular blogs in Germany and some new  
blogs written by experienced blogges: http://antifreeze.de (music),  
http://lautgeben.de (politics), http://trashkurs.de (home recording)  
and http://zoomo.de (radio and TV).

All of these blogs are running on WordPress and I'll try to make them  
running from a single WordPress installation the next few days. I  
have allready written some plugins (image manipulation and placement,  
some addsense stuff, a simply reminder function for the tv blog...)  
which we will release for free within the next few weeks.

Also I want to try to contribute to the WordPress development.

Can I just ask why you would want to do that? Surely if you have five
seperate blogs you'd want five seperate WP installations... it seems
like things would be a lot simpler that way.

I don't fully agree. Affordable hosts provide a limited number of databases. A
powerful software package should include a powerful schema that allows
information re-use and the possible interaction between the tables.

Examples: having a single login (for the database as well as the front-end
software), comprehensive sqldump, and this list can be further extended...

With my current Web host, a basic package comes with only a single database. I
am lucky to have 20 at the moment and I needed to pay more because of the
scattered database, some of which have commonalities.

To wrap up, one intstallation with multiple blogs does have its pros.

You can have any number of blogs in one database by changing the table 
prefix in wp-config.php for each blog. Each blog will have its own options, 
its own plugins, themes, users/authors, on and on. One database.

I'm not completly sure. But tha last days I've got sick of updating  
pulgins on five seperate installations. After updating I've got to  
check the updates five times. That rises the chance of making  
mistakes by five times. :)

Okay, my first problem, not a quite simple one: in WP 1.5.x I have  
the option to show at most 3 days in the blog. Thats cool for the  
index Page but it is also valid for the archive and for the search  
results - even worse I don't have a "show older results"-link. I  
could try to fix it that way that the show older results links are  
also visible on the search and archive page - but I'm not sure if  
this would be good at all - wouldn't a "show maximum number of posts"- 
option be more usefull here? The problem about this is that in my  
first step here I would not just fix a little bug but would change  
the way WordPress works. I want to make my changes to be part of the  
next WordPress realease to avoid having to patch five blogs the next  
time a WordPress release is going to roll out - I'm sure it will  
simply a mess after some relasing. Change it or simply switch to  
"show 10 posts"?

Most users don't require such fine-grained control in the admin interface. A 
plugin could be written to alter the wp-query before the theme is loaded. 
Like this:

function custom_post_count() {
if (is_archive()) // Customize the query with LIMIT=10
if (is_search()) // ...or a WHERE clause to limit dates.
}
add_action('template_redirect','custom_post_count');

Or something like that... don't quote me. :)

If you initialise all blogs consistently, here is what I suggest:

-Install a base blog in directory ~/blog1

-Customise ~/blog1 by adding plug-ins and testing thoroughly

-Once done, clone ~/blog1, e.g.:

cp -r ~/blog1 ~/blog2
cp -r ~/blog1 ~/blog3
...

-Dump a copy of blog1's database, e.g.

mysqldump --user [DB_username] --password=[DB_password] [DB_name]>
~/tmp/mydatabase1.dump

-Create 4 new databases (say username_blog2..5) and initialise them

-'Restore' username_blog2..5 by using the sql dump from blog1

-Change the database connection settings for blog2..5

-You now have 5 installations that are identical.

Good luck,

Roy

I know this is going to really annoy people, but right now I'm not bothered.

If you are running the latest 1.6 (it's the one with the 'Do Not Use' in 
the version) AND you are blogging about it and what it offers AND you 
are not making it crystal clear it should not be used, would you be so 
kind as to drop by the forums to answer the inevitable rise in questions 
from people to also get that code and their blog breaks.

After what has happened in the past, and the steps taken to make getting 
that code harder, I'm sure we will appreciate your help.

IN the Italian Forum we have cleary stated that any thread about
request for info/help/etc about 1.6 will be immediatly close and that
no support for 1.6 will be given till a public official version (beta
or final) will be realeased. I'm going to add a libe that say not to
try to english forum too.

I think moderators should clearly close/delete all this thread and
make sticky posts in the various forum about it.

I hope the nightly build it's still not easy accessible to wide
audience.

Apologies - I should have been clearer.

There are people on the forums who have not yet upgraded to 1.5.1.2
In the forums we are still working - in some cases - with 1.2
The very very last thing we need to see on blogs is people saying how 
cool ANY features in 1.6 are. Those sort of posts lead to non-coders 
downloading the code, upgrading their blogs then yelling becaue things 
break.
It will also lead to people saying "Should I upgrade to 1.5.1.2 or wait 
for 1.6" and it definitely increases the pressure and anticipation for 
the next release.

We do not need this hassle, really we do not. If you are going to 
discuss it, please make it abundantly clear that it must not be used 
unless you want a broken blog / can write PHP in your sleep.

If no-one answering posts in the forum is using 1.6, then what do we do 
? Berating them goes only so far, and given the nature of the code and 
the huge amount of changes that appear to be planned I think it's only 
responsible to keep any talk of 1.6 to the appropriate lists.

A bit of redudnacy you may want to fix:


 
 	// Set GUID
 	$wpdb->query("UPDATE $wpdb->posts SET guid = '" .
get_permalink($post_ID) . "' WHERE ID = '$post_ID'");
 	
 	wp_set_post_cats('', $post_ID, $post_category);

	$wpdb->query("UPDATE $wpdb->posts SET guid = '" .
get_permalink($post_ID) . "' WHERE ID = '$post_ID'");


Really need to set the guid twice?

Maybe make a forum to discuss versions that are yet to be supported by
users that fit your "want a broken blog / can write PHP in your sleep"
category or send them to wp-testers (or is that even the right
place?)?

Subject: [wp-hackers] UI development for 1.6
Message-ID: <DE7EB2FB-E054-11D9-936B-0003931722DA@funkive.com>

Are there any UI designers working on the 1.6 interface?

I understand ideas from the shuttle project are being rolled into 
1.6... but that project seems a little underground at the moment, is 
there something/one co-ordinating work in this area?

It would be good to roll some usability into the new do-not-use UI as 
it appears to be adding features which, while cool, are adding a level 
of complexity WP has not had before.

Terrence Wood.

Nope.  Cut-and-paste error.  Fixed in 2650.

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2650

2650 also consolidates the post edit code.  Over 300 lines eliminated
from post.php.  We can probably knock another 100 off of that.

If alpha-do-not-use testers ask for help in the forums, shouldn't they
be politely but firmly direct to the proper venue?

It's counterproductive to help people in a forum where you've told
them *not* to ask for help. You don't stop your puppy from begging at
the table by feeding him there, even if he doesn't don't read warnings
and feels he has some sort of entitlement to table scraps, regardless
of any admonishment elsewhere.

As I understand it, people can't even get the alpha-do-not-use version
without either signing up for the list or installing and learning to
use an SVN client, so it's pretty hard to see how an naive user could
stumble on to it accidently.

For that matter, wouldn't it simplify support to insist that everyone
install the latest stable release before they ask for help?

Yes, that's true, but when we have very well read blogs blathering on 
about 1.6 it does not help.
Until the code reaches an advanced stage everyone will be directed at 
the testers list but I wrote this mail because I KNOW what will happen 
and I'd rather it did not, especially so early on - it's just asking for 
trouble.

It's very simple - run whatever code you want but either be quiet about 
it or post huge great "Do Not Touch" messages as well.

Actually, I think we should talk/blather about it more. I'd like to do
something like the KDE Commit Digest, Kernel Traffic, and the old GNOME
weeklies.

http://commit-digest.org/
http://www.kerneltraffic.org/

The commit digest is a common open source practice that keeps a
community informed about what's going on with development and can serve
to pull in new developers.  And, hey, sometimes developers just like to
talk about what they are working on.  You call it blather, I call it
blogging.  What's this tool do again?

Most open source projects go out of the way to make obtaining
development versions easier.  Here we do the opposite and insist on
these attempts at social engineering.  It's not all about the forums.
There's more to the ecology than that.

Regardless, right now the code is available only through subversion.
That's sufficiently inaccessible to dissuade most people.

With much respect, I know that. But I'm in the forums every day for long 
periods of time. I know how they function and to be honest I can give 
you half a dozen names of the idiots who will download the minute they 
can and will then yell in the forums.

I appreciate where you are coming from and the need for news, but I do 
think my request was reasonable.

All forum requests for any unreleased code/versions will get a very curt 
response.

I'm glad to hear this opinion!

I find all this talk about hiding the code and forbidding people to
talk about the latest and greatest developments very strange, and it's
not something which I've seen before on the other OpenSource projects
I've been using.

Subversion is fine and should not be considered obscure --- if people
think so, then they should rightly stay away.

Could we get Gmane newsgroups for the other lists there too?

I'm already reading the wp-hackers list through Gmane:

  http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wordpress.devel

and I find it much more convenient than a normal mailinglist.

I'm unaware of anyone "forbidding" you to talk about 1.6. What Podz is 
asking is that when you do talk about it, provide appropriate warnings. 
He doesn't want to shut people up, but to make sure anyone who decides 
to play on the edge and install unreleased product is under no illusions 
about the level of support they'll receive.

Parts of the new look are based on a mockup the Shuttle project did.

People who use bleeding edge software can end up bleeding --- I would
expect everybody who installs WordPress from the Subversion repository
to know that.

Of course write it in the README file, the INSTALL file and put it in
the defaul theme templates that this is to be considered pre-alpha
quality code (or what ever kind of quality we're talking about). And
then be done with it --- I find treating people like little children a
bad idea.

Or maybe the development for this 1.6 version should go into a
experiemntal branch? People (like me) could then continue using the
SVN trunk to get bugfixes when they occur, and the developers can work
in relative peace on version 1.6.

Unfortunately, many don't.  And even if they do, they sometimes might 
think they still deserve some form of "official" support, for any number 
of reasons (valid or otherwise).

It's not so much a matter of treating people like children, as it is a 
support management issue.  Podz and a _very_ small handful of others 
exert a herculean effort in the support forums.  These folks quite 
literally bear the brunt of the support for WordPress.

These folks have neither the time nor the inclination to support 
bleeding edge releases.  Yet invariably people come to the support 
forums seeking help on said bleeding edge releases.  Whatever approach 
the support folks take is the wrong one (see all the hooplah over the 
forums search for a stellar example of this):
* lock threads?  Nazis!
* try to help?  You broke it worse!
* point elsewhere?  What the hell kind of support forum is this?

It wears on a person after a while.

Thankfully for Podz and crew, I have volunteered to be the "heavy" in 
the forums, at least until I start taking things too personally.

When the inevitable bleeding edge support questions trickle into the 
forums, I am going to link to the following:
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Supported_Versions
and then close the thread.

Right now, I don't care what names and insults are hurled at me.  When 
that changes, I'll let the support crew know, and someone else can play 
the fall guy for a bit.

There's always the nightly build, and all it takes to get is to join the 
WP-Testers list. The hurdle is not all that high--nor should it be.

> I find treating people like little children a bad idea.

Then you won't take issue with me saying if someone needs to show off 
their new WordPress swag, they accept some responsibility and mention 
the dangers of installing it on a production site, etc. I don't consider 
that treating people like children, but as people you don't want to see 
run into problems they can't get themselves out of.

Let us talk in code first:

function modify_search_string($query) {
	$query->set('s', 'baba');
}

add_action('parse_query', 'modify_search_string');

$query is a reference to the WP_Query object whose parse_query is 
called. For details about what can you do with $query see the WP_Query 
code in classes.php (nope, I didn't find WP_Query docs in the codex).

I already linked to the necessary resources at the codex.
Don't forget to set $wpdb to global in the function.

That's really quite nice. Matt's expressed some interest in themes
that break the 2-column paradigm, so if you play your cards right you
may end up on http://wordpress.org/extend/themes :)

Just one question: for people that aren't flickr users, what do you
plan to place in the right hand column?

$wpdb is for doing things with the database. If you wanted to alter
the query, you would indeed need to use WP_Query, which is what
Nikolay was talking about.

I'm sure you're right -- I don't personally look through the forums
because I much prefer my mail/news client to my webbrowser when it
comes to engaging in discussions.

Which I think is an okay solution.

Maybe it's a matter of proportions and the target user group: other
projects which I've been following (the Enlightenment project for
example) have never had 300.000+ downloads of their software releases,
and their target audiences were of a more geekish nature.

No screenshots. 
No visible design discussion.
No idea which 'parts' of the invisible mockup will be incorporated.
No openness.

A group of people said "we want to donate our time to redesign the WP 
backend" completely independent of WP development, I said "Cool, let me 
set up a mailing list for you so I can keep track of what's going on." 
Why is it "underground"? I don't know, maybe because more people find 
time for arguing rather than coding. Shuttle is still separate, I just 
stole some of their ideas and mixed it up with a drag-n-drop thing I 
found. This list is entirely appropriate and relevant for discussing any 
and all development of WP. Right now we're in an alpha stage where 
EVERYTHING is flexible and open for discussion, no decisions have been 
made about and nothing is set in stone.

Matt: I don't think he was accusing it of being kept secret, he was just 
saying that it hasn't been mentioned on too many blogs and there is no 
current "status" other than the alpha you just stated. I think it was 
just a few curious users looking for some information as to what it 
*might* be like when its finished. New features, improvements, etc...

Let me go into some more detail here. I have an additional table that 
has the post id as one of the columns and and another column that is a 
text column.
The query I want to generate would be something like

SELECT DISTINCT wp_post.* FROM wp_post
LEFT JOIN mytable ON wp_post.ID = mytable.ID
WHERE ((wp_post.post_title LIKE '%word%')
   OR (wp_post.post_content LIKE '%word%')
   OR (mytable.description LIKE '%word%'))
AND (post_status = "publish")
GROUP BY p.ID
ORDER BY  post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 10


Where it gets nasty for me is I need to 1) add the left join. That 
doesn't seem too bad since there is the posts_join filter. However 
adding the additional or piece for mytable seems to be a challenge. Here 
is the "where" string that I get passed in the posts_where filter. With 
multiple words in the search list, it seems to get even nastier. I would 
need to insert my piece in there inside the parens.

AND   0=1    AND (((post_title LIKE '%word%') OR (post_content LIKE 
'%word%')) OR (post_title LIKE '%word%') OR (post_content LIKE 
'%word%')) AND post_date_gmt <= '2005-06-21 19:12:59' AND (post_status = 
"publish")

Is there a cleaner way than this?

TIA,
Bill

I'm certainly not arguing about anything...

I wanted to contribute constructively -- that's why I said I would take 
a couple of days to gather my thoughts, rather than just throwing 
around some criticisms -- and being busy I wanted to gauge what had 
been done so I don't have to reinvent the wheel. That's why I asked 
first, and you gotta admit Yes/No answers are not particularly helpful 
in creating a dialogue.

What I mean by Shuttle being underground is that there seems to be no 
word from them about where they are at, and it appears their changes 
are being rolled into WP. Like it or not Shuttle *is* WP -- the team 
members are all WP celebs, and many people are awaiting their 
redevelopment.

But anyway heres the readers digest version of my thoughts...

Good things:
1. Use of cookies to store a customized entry form.
2. Use of brothercakes accessible box thingy.

Some ideas for consideration (in no particular order):
1. Ditch using tab index on the form -- it breaks keyboard navigation, 
and means people have to change modes (keyboard to mouse) to navigate 
the form properly. Focus the first field with js onload if you want.

2. Resolve the source order to (a) eliminate the mode change,(b) so the 
form make sense when is CSS off, (c) is easier for ppl to tweak in 
their own CSS (d) will allow better integration of plugged in fields 
into the form. Basically, this means grouping all the 'advanced 
options' together, rather than splitting them up before and after the 
title & content fields.

3. Make the submit buttons the last thing on the form. There is a 
disconnect that occurs by having form controls both above and below the 
buttons that affect them.

4. Eliminate the show/hide for every individual advanced option.  Most 
users will use less than half of these. Instead put these under one 
heading called 'advanced options'. Allow users to drag/select which 
advanced options they want to appear on their usual form and hide the 
rest.

5. Allow reordering of the main (title,excerpt, content) form fields. 
(Personally, I use the excerpt and I prefer it above the content field, 
others may dis/agree)

6. Use the 'fieldset' element properly. 'Fieldset' is being used to 
label form controls. It is supposed to group related controls together. 
Use the 'label' element to describe the form control -- this has other 
benefits such as improving the clickable target, plus it's extra points 
for semantics.

7. Change 'save and continue editing' button to a checkbox 'continue 
editing' and just have the 'save' and 'publish' buttons.

8. Provide a 'toolbar' hook so tools can be plugged into the form code 
above the content area without relying on js to provide a solution.

9. Make the show/hide toggles larger and provide hover/focus states. 
They are a really small target next to the blue title-bar device.

10. Ensure #postdiv is cleared properly when expanding adv. opts.

11. Close the adv. opt. boxes when the javascript loads in the doc 
head, and reopen them onload, rather than closing them onload, it will 
look prettier.


kind regards
Terrence Wood.

Yes!

Write Post:
    Save and Continue Editing, *Save*, Publish

Edit Post:
    Save and Continue Editing, *Save*

Edit Draft:
    Save and Continue Editing, *Save*, Publish

I'd venture that any time meant to be saved by not having people hit 
additional form controls is wasted by having them read the text on the 
bunch of buttons. Unless there's an important reason to maintain this 
design, It should at least be:

    ---------
    | *Save* | [x] Continue Editing
    ---------
    -----------------------------
                 Publish
    -----------------------------

My recommendation is to remove the Publish button too, given that the 
toggle in the sidebar is setting the post status between 
Private/Draft/Publish (that would also have the nice side effect of 
having the same exact set of buttons, whatever the posts' attributes), 
but that might not fit the users' mode-of-thinking well.

One other thing:
It would be handy to have 'Edit Post' as one of the links after you've 
saved a post.  Currently there's a link to 'View Site' there, but 'Edit 
Post' would be handy because more than once I've clicked 'Publish' and 
as it was posting seen a typo or some thing I wanted/needed to change.

I'd go a step farther and remove your "Continue Editing" checkbox.

Click save.  The post is saved.  Indicate to the user that the post was 
saved.  The edit form is presented with the saved content for additional 
edits, if desired.

Totally agree. If you clicked save in Word, it wouldn't ask you if you
wanted to continue editing while it printed the document.

Subject: [wp-hackers] More on WordPress user permissions overhaul
Message-ID: <1119420607.8490.21.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi folks,

I'm a relative newcomer as a WordPress user, and definitely a newcomer
when it comes to hacking around the wp code.  I'm really happy with
WordPress as a user, and hence why I'm signing up for this list.

The timing of the "User Permissions system overhaul" thread couldn't be
better from my perspective, since I'm currently working on studying the
authorization models of various popular web applications, and publishing
the results on a wiki that I've set up for this purpose:
http://spectaclar.org  .  I've already received a couple outside
contributions (Nagios and RequestTracker) and would appreciate others.
I've cc'd the discuss@spectaclar.org mailing list, since this is a very
appropriate topic for that mailing list.

I'd like to help with the WordPress permissions overhaul in any way that
I can.  From my perspective, the ideal solution could be shared among
many common applications, such as MediaWiki, Mailman, Bugzilla, etc.
Certainly, it's much easier to share systems among PHP-based systems,
and there already seems to be strong interest in MediaWiki/WordPress
intergration, so perhaps that's a good starting point.

The new user rights system in MediaWiki 1.5 is documented here:
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:User_rights

It's a very simple system, but I think gets the essentials correct.  To
the extent that any permissions management code can be shared between
the systems, I think it should be attempted.

Anyway, I've been lurking on IRC for a while (robla) and am kicking
myself for not getting on this list sooner.  Let me know how I can help.

Thanks
Rob

Semi-related to this, I know the dashboard by default already includes
the last handful of posts from the WP Development blog that lists any
updates but a lot of the time I just breeze past that page so I don't
realize there are any updates. Now of course you could say the due
diligence should be on me to read it, but wouldn't it be a good idea
to make security alerts stand out so people see it and understand that
it is important they upgrade straight away?

Also it might be a good idea if we recommended people used a table
prefix other than the default and if possible use a MySQL database
user that only has access to the WP database and that doesn't have
DROP privileges, this would help restrict what someone could do with
an SQL injection attack. I had a quick look in the Codex but couldn't
see anything along the lines of how to harden your WP install at all
so is this soething worthwhile looking into?

I think there is already a mailing list for release announcement. If people 
are concerned with security, they will subscribe at download I think. And 
telling them there is a security flaw won't make 90% of them upgrade. Thay'll 
just think "this won't happen to me, my blog is not known enough".

Basically, the user running wordpress should only have insert, delete, update 
and select rights, and only on the wordpress database. Those privileges 
should only be changed at upgrade time.
I can write a little something about it and post it on the codex (also with 
perms issues and some server configuration ideas) and add it to the codex 
when I get home tonight.

I was thinking more for your every day user than those of us that are
tech savvy enough to follow a release announcement mailing list. Most
users are likely to often see the dashboard so when a security alert
is right there in big, bold text with a thick red border and a very
stern recommendation that they should upgrade ASAP or risk being
hacked then I think people would be a lot more likely to upgrade.

Although you are right in that people will still ignore it if they
read it but if we can at least make sure they read it then that is one
more step we can take.

All the question is "do people ever look at the dashboard?"
Why not include a simple security alert rss feed on wordpress.org which would 
be load when wp-admin is reached and make an alert message with a link 
pointing to the download page to be displayed on every admin when the version 
used is <= to the version with a fix?
That way we can expect the users to see they MUST upgrade.
Just think about an option to deactivate such an alert.

The fact is I have a lot of Wordpress users on my server (every user has at 
least one Wordpress install, and I recently had a look at their account. Some 
of them were still using 1.2 in spite of a few mails I had sent asking  for 
upgrade each time a new release was made.
So even with a big red alert, I still have some doubts.

We were discussing security matters sooner this afternoon. What about setting 
up a page gathering every _real_ security announces regarding Wordpress with 
version?
On the one hand this does not appear as a good way to promote Wordpress, but 
on the other hand, it may show we are really concerned by security.

I've thought about replacing that in the packaged theme with a google
ad or something similar. It's still a work in progress, so I'm still
tweaking the code, but that large area will stay. It's a good place
for large images and advertising.

Not afaik, because the whole time/date system of WordPress relies on
mysql specific functions.

What's wrong with storing the date/time as unix epoch time? I think a 
better question is to inquire whether there are any plans of including 
database abstraction in WP.

People have asked in the past, but due to the insanely large amount of
code relying on mysql specific time/date functions (and the
AUTO_INCREMENT column type that is not implemented in all SQLs) that
porting everything over and trying to support multiple systems would
just be too much of a hassle.

AFAICT the big reason for both "local" and GMT (equivalent of seconds
since unix epoch) times in the database is permalink support.  The
local time is needed to keep the permalinks from changing.

But that actually brings up a great question: does WP >have< to depend upon 
the mysql date type?  I see constant conversions back and forth between 
formats, and I'm not sure it actually buys that much (at the cost of losing 
portability).  I guess specific 'calendar' functions are easier with the 
datetime stuff (i.e., +1 month == how many seconds?  depends on the calendar 
source date! ;) ) -- but don't know how much that stuff is used, or how 
easily it could be replaced.  (Matt, any thoughts?)

I'm torn on this topic, as I have myself locked in a number of mysql-custom 
queries and such in my own plugin work -- but would love to see if there's a 
good way to support SQLite given it makes test environments easier, as well 
as potentially making some sites faster. ;)

This is a rant, ignore at will...

My point was that, once again, there is NO visibility to discussions
(if any) about the design. Instead the code is *already in* WordPress.
That looks like a decision made to me.

*Now*, there is some discussion about the nuances of this new
interface. *You*, Matt,  may have been following along on the mailing
list you set up for the Shuttle team, but no one else to my knowledge
saw any of this before the decision was made and the code committed.

Similarly, there has been a interesting, constructive discussion on
this list about
overhauling the user permissions system [1] over the last week or so.
There has been no contribution from you Matt, yet you have been
*committing changes to the user system*. Are these changes related?
Have you taken any of the ideas raised on board? Could you at least
contribute to the thread? "Hey guys, I've already started implementing
your great ideas" or should it be "Don't bother discussing it, I've
decided what I'm doing."?

I didn't see any discussion about removing the textile and markdown
plugins, but they are gone. You claimed "Far too few people use these
for them to be included by default. To possibly be replaced by more
useful plugins after a survey."

Where do you get the figure of "far too few" from? Perhaps it would
have been better to have the survey *before* the decision is made.

Don't get me wrong, I think WordPress is a *great* product, I'm proud
to have been part of it. I will continue to help and contribute when I
can. I also promote it at every opportunity.

But when I see major decisions made with no visible discussion, when
long constructive threads on design and future direction seem to be
ignored, and when I know that some of the other original developers,
myself included, were refused commit permissions to the new subversion
repository. I can no longer kid myself that this is anything other
than a one man development project (sorry Ryan).

AFAIK, according to Trac developers, the RSS feed is broken (I know that 
for a fact) and what I read in the bug report for it, they don't plan on 
fixing it any time soon. Its broken because it doesn't authenticate you 
for the RSS feed, even if you set your reader to. It just returns 
nothing since the $USER variable is null.

Email updates, I'm not sure about this either. I haven't seen such a 
feature built in or heard about it elsewhere.

Message-ID: <ed51b67c05062222024a2d07d0@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings wp-hackers,

I've just written up an article on the Codex for plugin authors, on how to 
make plugins create their own tables in the WP database. Before this gets 
*released* into the Codex, I thought I'd run it by you guys. I want to know 
if you have any quibbles about the code or suggestions. This is an important 
article for the Codex, so it needs to be as accurate as possible.

The main point of the article is efficiency. We don't want to check/install 
the table every time a page is loaded. So keep that in mind as you're 
reading it. Go ahead and make comments on the discussion page

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Jalenack/Creating_Tables_with_Plugins

Thanks!

Hi Andrew,

I dropped some simpler code in the discussion of your wiki page.

Cheers,
D.

Thanks Denis,

Nice code. Very easy to understand. But doesn't it weaken performance 
slightly, by checking the table version number every time the site loads? Or 
is it too insignificant? The way I've done it, it only checks if there's 
been a plugin activation. Your way is definitely cleaner.

Thanks again,

Andrew

P.S. Dave - Yes, it drives me crazy as well when plugin authors use wp_ 
without a second thought. At the Codex, we try to teach them better than 
that :-)

The overhead is small, and I imagine you can combine the two. :)

Yes i saw how it ended :) Was just strange that quite at same time we
got hacked and Podz asked if there was a security problem, just an
oddly coincidence :)

Fortunatly my problem was due to my lazinss (i though i'd apply the
security fix, maybe my hosting provider replaced a backup without
informing me).

Thee good is that all it's ok :)

As much as I hate to say it, I have to agree about the last bit, and
props to Mike for being the first one out of the many who I'm sure are
thinking it to say it.

I hope that Matt realizes that there is an entire community out there
that would love to be a part of all of this, as well as some people
that are already said to be "developers." And the community extends
well beyond just coding and 1.6 development. There are so many people
out there that would be willing to work on adding stuff to
wordpress.org/extend/, to fixing up the forums, to help make sure
everything runs smoothly. Everyone realizes that WP is becoming a
difficult thing to maintain, and everyone would love to help. If I'm
getting what Mike Little is going at, maybe a little feedback from
everyone in the community should be considered..

I was reluctant to be the first person to follow-up Mike's comments. I 
think one
has to consider the issues with openness. For example:

   -Geography: it would always be hard to communicate changes unless 
there is one
central site.

   -Authority: being able to control nasty changes to pages or breakage of
builds.

I don't want to go as far as comparing the WordPress 'panel' to the tyranny of
Linus, who often refuses to incorporate bits into the kernel (even when all
world professionals in a particular field support a certain move).

An application expands owing to its users. Its direction must be 
defined by the
the users, using open discussions which are the iron fist.

No, we probably need to abstract our date handling stuff out somehow. I 
remember the adodb date handling code being recommended a long time ago. 
Even though we store dates in the extremely flexible mysql DATETIME format 
we still handle it internally using date() functions so anything before 
1969 is useless. (Faux historical blogs or diaries, for example.) It may 
also be a good first step toward *lightweight* database portability as well.

    First, the disclaimer - I don't know anybody in the WP "community" - 
in fact, I stay as far away from most "communities" for reasons such as 
this :p I don't know Matt, I don't know Ryan and I certainly don't know 
the people who've written before and I mostly lurk on this list and 
don't contribute much - except for one plugin that I've written for WP. 
This is simply my opinion because I felt that *I* had to say this.

    When I first saw Mike Little's post, I wanted to say this but I kept 
quiet since it might be simply a storm in a tea cup. But others have 
voiced their own opinions since then and I feel I must voice my own. I 
have been part of open source projects before where people begin to feel 
an undue sense of ownership. Sure, everybody contributes in their own 
ways but to always feel that you are so important that all decisions 
have to be passed through you (not talking about anybody who wrote 
before mind you - this is a collective "you") and that every damn thing 
has to be collectively nitpicked and agreed upon before it is 
implemented is just plain ridiculous. Democracy is all well and fine but 
if you want to make it work and still get software out, you really have 
a herculean task on your hands :p We love to argue and that is a fact 
and everybody can stand around and discuss/argue the merits of one 
option versus another or somebody can simply take the lead, make some 
decisions and do something and if it doesn't work, then fix it where 
necessary. I believe that's what Matt's been doing.

    You need a leader for a project like WP. Somebody who has a vision 
and who will go ahead and implement it. Sure, if user input was listened 
to and implemented, it would be good but in the end, it is the developer 
who is putting his time in and he's not getting paid for any of this 
darn it. Plus, this is open source - if you want a different 
implementation and don't like what Matt is doing, go ahead and do your 
own thing. Nobody is stopping you. Sure, you'll get the cries of but 
that will fragment the community, we don't want to detract from WP and 
so on - but what it comes down to is that if you don't like the way 
somebody is doing something, do your own thing. Don't criticise somebody 
for actually doing some work instead of waiting around for a committee 
to make the decisions - we have enough committees for everything as it 
is :p That's my two cents from a place where two cents have disappeared 
a long time ago!

This is a good point. Too many threads like this just slip off the top
active threads in the list and get ignored. I think the reason for
this is a cross between the limitations of the mailing list medium and
the fact that no-one is going in to make an authoratitive decision. I
think we'd _really_ benefit from a 'WordPress panel', a group of
people that are familiar with the WP codebase, with some experience in
software development and who know what's a good idea and what isn't.
They'd wander into threads like this and say, 'Yes, this needs to be
done', email Ryan and Matt and then things would get done. Or, they'd
read through a thread and say 'I don't think this would pay off', and
no-one's time would be wasted.

To be honest, I think we'd benefit from having more developers, too.
I'd like to see a group of people developing WP, not just two. We
could set up a hierachy where all changes made by this group have to
be accepted by Ryan or Matt first. This is a bit more long-term,
though. I'd like to see the 'WordPress panel' group set up soon.

Do you actually disagree with this decision, or are you just bringing
it up? I think if you really did disagree, you'd have sent an email to
the list and discussion would have ensued.

> But when I see major decisions made with no visible discussion,

Fahim's points are all valid. Someone really does need to make the
decisons. Not everything can be discussed.

My main worry is that threads which have a lot of great input are just
slipping everyone's attention. I really think this could solved by
having a group of decision makers.

Terrance seems to have started a great discussion here. If by "decisions" 
you mean working code instead of kvetching on a mailing list, then yes, 
decisions are made constantly. That *does not* mean that the hour of work 
I checked in for people to play with is the One True Way and everything 
has already been set in stone, in fact nothing could be farther from the 
truth. Experimentations in a version clearly marked as alpha is a call for 
feedback.

I believe that it's MUCH easier for people to discuss and critique 
something people can see and poke, rather than a bunch of academic 
theorizing which has seldom proved productive on this list.

AFAIK, Shuttle is a few designers who throw photoshop comps back and forth 
to each other and are very good at creating hype due to their popularity 
within the community. If you would like to join the Shuttle group, please 
contact those folks, I don't control it. I don't know why they chose to 
keep it private, and I don't think that's the best way to do things. 
However if you want to discuss WP UI, this list is the place to do it.

Have you looked at what the changes actually were? The usermeta system has 
been planned forever (it was explained and originally planned for 1.3) and 
its development is independent of any changes regarding user levels. I 
haven't particpated in the user level discussion persanally because I 
don't have anything to add to it at this point and I'd rather see where 
the ideas go without my participation. I think it would be interesting to 
survey good and bad user access systems and try to find the patterns which 
work well between them. This week I've been travelling and only in front 
of a computer for 30 minutes or less at a time, so I don't have any 
bandwidth to do that sort of thing.

Alternative text formatting languages are a fairly advanced concept and 
the the plugins weren't pleasing anybody. Newbies were confused, as 
activating the plugin wouldn't change anything in the WP interface but 
suddenly the text you write does funky things you may or may not expect, 
and the advanced users who rely on Markdown and Textile were unhappy that 
it wasn't the version they wanted and if they know enough to use those 
things they know enough to get the plugins themself anyway. I think the 
"official" plugins we bless with distribution should show off the 
capabilities of plugins a bit more and provide functionality people 
*actually ask for*, like stats or 3rd party integration points.

> Where do you get the figure of "far too few" from? Perhaps it would

It was informal, but since I obsessedly read hundreds of posts about WP 
and track a lot of trends in the community, I think I have a fairly good 
feel for the pulse of things. I don't claim this is perfect and I'm don't 
mind people offering evidience to the contrary. There have been several 
threads about plugins on the forums which had great responses.

No final decisions have been made for 1.6, it's all open to discussion.

Everything on all these lists is read. And blog posts. And IRC 
discussions. And forum threads.

Committing != community status. It simply is a way to ensure that all the 
code that goes into the core is reviewed before being distributed to the 
world.

Many original developers, yourself included, haven't contributed enough 
code lately (the past year or so) to warrant commit access. Most patches 
that come in still require a fair amount of editing. (There are exceptions 
like mdawaffe, and Ryan back in the day.) Adding lanes to a highway 
doesn't make traffic any faster, and having everybody and their brother 
mucking around directly with the core would not make development any 
faster. (This is a separate issue from having modules or sections that 
people take ownership for, which we need to do more of.)

I noticed you did not complain about the hundreds of thousands of WP blogs 
that link to you out of the box.

It would be great to have something like people have been doing for the 
IRC meetups, where in addition to the transcription (mailing list 
archives) someone summarizes the positions taken and the conclusions 
reached. I don't know where in the Codex would be the right place for this 
or if it needs something else (I'll defer to the docs team on that question).

Reducing things to bullet points on a wiki would be a huge help, I think 
fewer ideas would be lost. It would require a dedicated person working on 
it though.

That doesn't mean that one couldn't use a Unix epoch timestamp: store
the (GMT) post date as a Unix timestamp and store a time zone offset
along with it. Then calculate the local time based on that.

Notice that this wont cost more that what is already done today where
all timestamps are offset by the global gmt_offset setting.

Two variables either way... I don't really see an upside.

And if you were thinking that the offset would be one variable, set in 
the options (as opposed to per-post), that wouldn't work.  What happens 
when you change time zones?  All of a sudden that post you made at 23:36 
GMT gets pushed over to the next day, and the permalink changes.  Heck, 
you don't even have to change time zones... DST would do that by itself.

I think he was talking about using a timestamp (seconds since the unix
epoch) instead of mySQL's DATETIME.

Mike the best solution to all your complaints against Matt would be show 
everyone  the shiny new code which you want should go into the next WP 
version!!

You may not have commit access BUT no one prevents you from writing code 
- if your code is better people will use more of that

I haven't used 1.6 ALPHA yet, so my feedback is all second hand.  My 
understanding is that 1.6's post interface provides collapsable and 
movable panels on the post screen.  I was told that the initial load 
time for the post screen is unpleasantly long.

What _value_ is provided by collapsable / movable panels in the post 
screen?  In what way does this make WordPress a better blogging product? 
  Does it speed up the posting process for the majority of users, 
without a negative result for the minority of users?

A good friend of mine migrated from MovabteType to WordPress 
_specifically_ for the admin interface.  He uses a crappy dial-up 
connection, and was thrilled with the responsiveness of WP's image-free 
admin interface.  Will he be able to keep his enthusaism?

I asked if there was any way to "turn off" the fancy new post screen, 
and was told "nope".  Please consider this my contribution to the 
discussion: make any fancy post screen an optional, non-default, thing. 
  People who want it can turn it on.  People who don't want it need 
never deal with it.

Adding new features is super; and it's certainly the more exciting 
aspect of product development.  But the forums are littered with support 
questions about already-implemented but poorly-working features.

After yesterday's IRC meetup, I asked Podz to list a few of WordPress's 
advertised "features" that generate significant support requests. 
Without batting an eye, he responded:
    "rewrite rules / Image/ Images / More Images /"

Folks in the support forum aren't having problems with their posting 
screens (or if they are, I haven't seen it).  Sure, the post screen 
could use some adjusting, to minimize the amount of clutter, but 
development effort toward features that people struggle with seems 
better than adding new gloss.

I learned last night that someone had been tasked with revamping the 
image handling in 1.6.  That was the first I'd heard about it.  _THAT_ 
is something that will substantially benefit a lot more users than a 
fancy dynamic post interface.  An improved image upload and insertion 
process is, by itself, enough to motivate a lot of people to upgrade.

But that code hasn't been checked in yet, so no one gets to discuss it.

Great!

But you must recognize the one-sidedness of the discussion.  You get to 
roll stuff into the code as part of your "discussion", while no one else 
can.  By default you get to rely on lots of poeple to test your side of 
the conversation, but the other folks are often relegated to "a bunch of 
academic theorizing".

If I want to "discuss" some major overhaul of WordPress, it's a little 
harder for me to get everyone to download and test it, regardless of the 
possible merits of my suggestion.

Why would someone complain about something that is not problematic? 
Mike's email was a discussion of his observation of "problems" with 
respect to the openness of WordPress development.  Your dig that his 
complaints didn't include this item seems like a red herring, or 
possibly a personal attack.

I first started becoming concerned about development openness when the 
security vulnerability was announced, and 1.5.1.2 went up.  I asked if 
there was a security team.  You said "Yes".

_WHO?_

How can we officially direct others to this team, when claims of a new 
vulnerability arise?  If you're travelling, with 30 minutes of net 
access per day, who is responsible for responding to security issues?

To add context to my original post, I thought it was outrageous  Mike 
Little was
had been denied committal, but of course this could simply be a fluke. Judging
by The Internet Archive, some current developers have not been around as long
as Mike.

I became a bit worried about the direction WordPress had taken. The link
exchanges are nothing to sneeze at, with potential rewards under the table.
WordPress 'articles' did not help credibility either.

It often seems as if WP is an impenetrable development community. Many
suggestions (including several of mine, which were definitely 
constructive) are
ignored and additional code is labeled "plug-in" and added to a 
'graveyard'. The
community makes some independent decisions (without polls) and while it's
XFN-friendly, it is not very professionally friendly (read: open). In the
spirit of the GPL, what was open must remain open. Until some months ago, b2
was not even acknowledged properly.

Yes, thanks! :-)

I would then have all the WordPress code that deals with dates use the
integer timestamp instead of converting back and forth between strings
and integers multiple times --- having just a single rule ("all
timestamps are integers, measuring the number of seconds since Jan 1st
1970 GMT") makes a lot of things easier.

See the get_lastpostdate() function in wp-includes/functions.php for
example. It uses one of three similar queries to figure out which post
has the greatest timestamp and to return it in GMT, server, or blog
time. I think that's too complicated --- first of all a single query
should be enough with my imaginary table schema:

  SELECT post_date, timezone_offset
  FROM $wpdb->posts
  WHERE post_date <= NOW() AND post_status = 'publish'
  ORDER BY post_date DESC
  LIMIT 1

Then depending on the wanted return value you'll either return
post_date (for 'gmt' output) or post_date + timezone_offset for 'blog'
output. I don't know about the 'server' output --- hint, hint: this
function could use a comment or two explaining the possible arguments
and the return types!

Of course you wouldn't even want to be able to return anything other
than GMT time with a WP that deals with GMT throughout its entire
codebase.  So that would make the last paragraph unnecessary.

With all due respect, this is a weak argument. Your perception involves
accumulation of LOC's in order to gain possession.

Mike has to take care of his family too. He adds a great deal of persona to
WordPress.

I think you need to get off the high horse; do not spit at the place you came
from.

"link out of the box"?!?!?! Playing "Big Daddy" is not justified, especially
since you indirectly get paid by CNET to work on WordPress. Mike never 
received
a dime.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Developing 1.6
Message-ID: <42BAA840.8000801@tamba2.org.uk>

I come at this from only 2 angles:
- being a blogger
- helping in the support forums.

 From what I read, there are going to be significant changes in 1.6 
which while no doubt welcome to some, will move WP away from being a 
blogging tool and more toward a CMS. If you want a CMS, great. If you 
want to just blog, not so great.
1.2 was a blogging program and the nature of the forum posts reflected that.
1.5 is already a large step toward being a CMS and the forum posts have 
changed dramatically. There are more questions about images, about user 
levels, about podcasting, hiding categories and while there were the odd 
few with 1.2 there are now many many more.
What there is NOT is any difficulties with anything on the admin 
screens. Sure some people may want things a bit different, but there are 
no problems. Wysiwyg and the drag/drop stuff will change that.

When 1.6 comes out I'm sure there will be words like 'secure' mentioned 
to promote the masses to upgrade and I just know that someone will post 
very quickly indeed yelling that they want their admin screen back as it 
was. When the Dashboards recently went down it was bad enough in the 
forums with the multiple posts - a release coupled with these 
significant changes would be a nightmare to support.

Please make as much as possible optional. The 'options are bad' isn't a 
good response to this. Hey - make the entire /wp-admin section in two 
flavours.

I actually support the promotion of 1.5 as the blogging program and 
marketing anything above as a different product. But I know that won't 
happen.

That would be fine there was any kind of discussion beforehand. Yes, someone has
to make the decisions. But, I would hope it was after at least some kind of
heads up beforehand.

There are a lot of developers who are willing to put there time in and none of
them get paid. Though I understand Matt does get paid for a (very) small amount
of his time. His generous employers allow him work time to work on WordPress.

If you compare the process and volunteers around the Codex there is a marked
contrast. There are a number of really good players working on the Codex. Things
get planned and discussed in advance. It is very clearly democratic and is
working brilliantly. Occasionally some discussions have floundered and ended in
a stalemate, then someone has taken the decision and implemented one of the
solutions. The codex is a valuable resource. The quality is on the whole
outstanding.

I *really* wouldn't want to do that. That would not be a good idea.

I disagree, the decisions are being made: By Matt.

I disagree with this too. We don't want or need a committee. We already have two
mailing lists with plenty of experienced developers with a lot of knowledge,
good ideas and opinions. Just not enough discussion in advance of the major
changes to the system.

I did disagree, but only in a very minor way. I also raised it on the mailing
list after the event. The response was "There are better solutions and here is
one." And now I'm satisfied.

My complaint is, and has always been, about the lack of communication.

I think my complaints could be addressed by Matt or Ryan joining in (which they
regularly do) and then stating what decisions have been made!

Matt, it never, ever, feels that way. When it's checked-in then its in and
people are welcome to find bugs and polish it. When it's removed it's gone, end
of discussion. 

That's what comes across. I've never had the impression that these major
far-reaching decisions are reversible. From the off-list feedback I've received,
I know I'm not the only one who feels like this.

I know all about unproductive technical discussions on mailing lists: I've been
on the CVS mailing list for years! 

But there is a middle ground. A heads-up before something major is changed. Just
the chance for someone else to say, "hold on, have you thought about
X?", or "you
should take a look at Y, it may be a better starting point."

That's not my point, and you know it. The point is a change with HUGE impact on
the usability, accessibility, and supported platforms of WordPress has already
been checked-in to the repository. As far as I can see no-one on any of the
mailing lists, or who reads any of the WP a-list blogs could have seen this
coming. That's my point. The fact that I think this is a bad move is irrelevant!
See my next point.

I think the changes you are making are good. My point is that just a heads up on
the thread would have been very helpful. Just "I'm currently re-working the
underlying user data storage mechanisms... it should be easier to implement some
of your ideas when I'm done". So that some of the now-pointless discussions
about bolting a solution onto the 1.5 mechanism could be dropped.

All perfectly valid reasons for the decision. and far more informative than the

I too read as much as I can about WordPress, and try to track trends too. Again,
my point is that people don't seem to have the chance to "offer evidence to the
contrary". Decision made, deed done.

Hmmm, there have been a number of patches on the (old) bug tracking system which
were submitted, reviewed and approved by interested experienced parties, but
they didn't get committed, even when raised on the mailing list.

This still isn't my issue, I'm well aware that my contributions since the 30th
March 2003 (over two years now) are almost non-existent. 

I'm certainly not demanding that I or anyone else have a right to be part of any
decisions, or some kind of right to commit access because of previous work.


I summary, I will again state that I think WordPress is a great product. I think
that Matt and Ryan are a great coders. But I also think that there is no
development 'community'. 

There is a wonderful WordPress community, but development is a dictatorship. I
think some wrong decisions have been made because of it and there are
more to come.

The Wiki documentation of the IRC meetups is exactly what was suggested and
implemented to address this issue the last time I complained about it. That's
good, and should continue, but its a transcript of a one hour IRC meetup
dominated by the discussions of the codex team (that's not a bad thing, I see
decisions being made by the codex team just as I do on the wp-docs
mailing list).

But it still doesn't give enough people visibility of major development design
decisions. I don't think IRC is the right medium for ongoing discussions of the
sort I'm talking about. It's great for that immediacy of real time interaction
and some great ideas can quickly develop. But it doesn't promote further
discussion, and neither does the codex record.

You've missed my point. I don't have any great code to contribute. My
point is about the lack of communication and discussion,

Just a couple of issues I want to address...

> No final decisions have been made for 1.6, it's all open to discussion.
> 
> Everything on all these lists is read. And blog posts. And IRC 
> discussions. And forum threads.

My first issue: if this is all open to discussion, then why have I
barely seen any outside of this mailing list? I certainly haven't seen
any official discussion on #wordpress, and I'm usually there. You also
told us to keep our mouths shut at the June 15th meetup about 1.6 on
the forums, so we can't discuss it there. The only place I've seen any
reference to it is the wordpress meetups and the Codex request page
and here-- three places where more than half of the "smart idea
contributing" community have no idea where is. If it's meant to be
open, than have something more open than half-closed.

Secondly, how do you read IRC discussions when you are rarely in
#wordpress yourself, Matt? Several good ideas pass through there on a
weekly, even daily, basis, yet I rarely see an "official
representative" of WordPress there to see these discussions. From our
previous private discussions, I think you see #wordpress as nothing
but a place to shrug off support questions to those technically-savvy
enough to run an IRC client, but it's much more than that, and I think
someone involved with Wordpress' codebase should be there from
time-to-time to actually see these discussions.

I'm also inclined to think this is becoming more and more a one-man
project. While I can certainly see the point in wanting a sole leader
who "has a vision and who will go ahead and implement it," there's
also the need to add to this vision with something better that Matt
himself may not have thought of-- isn't that the beauty of being open
and having a community base? And Fahim is right, you can go ahead and
modify Wordpress to your wants and go off and do your thing, but this
does very little. It will not change how Matt manages Wordpress, nor
will it have very much effect on the userbase.

And as a last note:

> I noticed you did not complain about the hundreds of thousands of WP blogs 
> that link to you out of the box.

Low blows don't become you.

Roy,
I don't have any right to commit, and I have nothing major to
contribute right now. My point was about the closed nature of this
open source project.

If you know "the cathedral and the bazaar", I'm claiming WP is a
cathedral with one high priest.

I wasn't saying that seconds from epoch timestamps cannot be used.
The message I replied to seemed to suggest a single timestamp, which
is the issue I was addressing.

Storing a unix timestamp and the offset from gmt on each post would
achieve the same result as the current two timestamps.

Mike - you missed my point on the Spirit of Open Source - if you feel 
that WP development is a Cathedral then Open your own Bazaar - the GPL 
provides you exactly that freedom.

Forcing a developer to discuss his actions is IMHO taking away his 
freedom to develop the code as he wants to.

So the bottom line is Fork if you can else Forget it!

And yes forking is good competition and in true spirit of Open Source

I wrote this message before seeing Matt's follow-up. I said:

"I thought it was outrageous that Mike Little had been denied 
committal, but of
course this could simply be a fluke"

This can now be rephrased:

"Mike Little, co-founder of WordPress, has no committal privileges which is
_outrageous_"

One last point in defence of WP coders, possibly saying what Mike 
cannot say for
himself.

No communication -> no orientation -> no ideas -> no contribution.

Get you act together, priests, and open up discussion with _impact_. IRC
transcripts? Does anybody expect proficient coders to read transcripts?!?! Or
even join IRC channels? I haven't been using IRC since I was 16.

Tarique, Mike Little forked b2 along with Matt. Why should he be 
elbowed to work
on a fork for what he himself forked??? Who has admin privileges for wp.org?
Matt does. The mailing lists? Matt. The IRC channels? Matt. The code? Matt et
al. In my humble opinion, Mike had been robbed.

Good thinking, Matt---more delegation would solve a lot of the 
brick-wall-of-silence type issues people are coming up against.

I think a great example of what should be done is what the Mozilla 
project does. They have official core meetings and publish the minutes, 
mozillazine collects status reports from plugin authors, their 
representatives are always hashing issues out on one mailinglist or 
other--if you want to be 'in the know' about Mozilla, there are lots of 
places to go, with many decision makers always hanging on IRC. In fact, 
there's so much that most people would be fed up by the amount of 
information available long before they've finished reading the week's 
worth of info.

With wordpress, we have the svn log and 'scour everywhere for statements 
by matt'.

(Of course, they don't have the magnificent codex + forum resources that 
WP does.)

(Note also that I don't mean to suggest that organizing the developer 
community like that is solely Matt's responsibility.)

Roy, let's not make this an issue about personalities - I don't believe 
Mike intended it to be about personalities (my apologies to Mike for 
thinking at first it was ...) and dropping to the personal level is not 
going to achieve anything. The thing to do at this point would be to see 
where the differences of opinion might be and address the issues. As 
Mike has kept on pointing out - this is about WP and ensuring that it 
goes in a direction which would help all the users out there and a 
split, coup whatever is not going to help anybody (though I'd still do 
it if it were me - but that's my personal opinion :p) Sometimes I guess 
you gotta look at the bigger picture ...

    Having watched this discussion develop, I do have to make a few
comments ... again :p First, the whole remark by Matt about the link to
Mike "out of the box" was both irrelevant and low. I do grant that
Mike's first e-mail might have seemed like a personal attack on Matt -
that's the way it read on initial reading to me - but still, the remark
was uncalled for. Second, Mike really cleared the air with his later
mails where he clarified where he was coming from. I see his points now
and do agree with some of them :)
    I realize that Mike is looking at this from the big picture
perspective - as how will WP develop and where will it go? How will the
community as a whole be affected by the changes and the way WP is
managed? I can also see Matt's side of it, which is more along the lines
of get it done now and make changes later - which is how I tend to code
as well -. Unfortunately, this seems to be a clash of two different
philosophies - or to borrow a reference from Mike, the bazar vs. the
cathedral. There are those who like each approach but I don't know if it
would be possible to merge the two so that you have a solution which
works for all. Me, I'm a coder, not a thinker - I'd still be saying, if
you don't like the way it's done, do it your own way ... because that's
what I'd do. But I also agree with Mike that that wouldn't be the best
thing for the community at large. Perhaps if we each (or rather the
major players in the community who do have contributions to make) took a
step back and tried to look at this from the other person's perspective
..... ?

    Having watched this discussion develop, I do have to make a few 
comments ... again :p First, the whole remark by Matt about the link to 
Mike "out of the box" was both irrelevant and low. I do grant that 
Mike's first e-mail might have seemed like a personal attack on Matt - 
that's the way it read on initial reading to me - but still, the remark 
was uncalled for. Second, Mike really cleared the air with his later 
mails where he clarified where he was coming from. I see his points now 
and do agree with some of them :)
    I realize that Mike is looking at this from the big picture 
perspective - as how will WP develop and where will it go? How will the 
community as a whole be affected by the changes and the way WP is 
managed? I can also see Matt's side of it, which is more along the lines 
of get it done now and make changes later - which is how I tend to code 
as well -. Unfortunately, this seems to be a clash of two different 
philosophies - or to borrow a reference from Mike, the bazar vs. the 
cathedral. There are those who like each approach but I don't know if it 
would be possible to merge the two so that you have a solution which 
works for all. Me, I'm a coder, not a thinker - I'd still be saying, if 
you don't like the way it's done, do it your own way ... because that's 
what I'd do. But I also agree with Mike that that wouldn't be the best 
thing for the community at large. Perhaps if we each (or rather the 
major players in the community who do have contributions to make) took a 
step back and tried to look at this from the other person's perspective 
..... ?

Woah! Steady on Roy, Don't take things personal!

I like and admire Matt a lot. I'm really not an important person in

Has Matt ever denied / violated Mike's copyright over the code that Mike 
developed as per the GPL?

I presume no... (I do wonder what you mean by admin privileges over code 
- its GPLed!!!)

Who allowed Matt all the above privileges?

I presume Mike agreed (actively or passively does not matter)...

Rest of the argument for me is superfluous.

Roy,
Steady on, you are wandering off at a tangent. I've not had those
privileges, I don't want those privileges and don't have any natural
born right to those privileges.

Don't muddy the waters getting outraged about something imagined.

You are very right. My words were not intended to appear malevolent. I 
wanted to
point out 2 things:

   1. Discussion before deployment. A poll widget in wp.org would achieve
      this, or perhaps a verified E-mail vote. It can make everyone happy
      and give all users a sense of control.

   2. The committal/forking discussion was a bit disturbing, especially
      since Mike's privileges had been annulled without notification.
      This is yet another _communication_ problem.

I hope that Matt discusses this with Mike if they haven't done so 
already. This
will have to be over the phone because text is ambiguous and impersonal. I am
sure they will reach a compromise.

I can't agree with you, sorry. We have now a 1.5x that looks stable
and performant, when 1.6 (or 2.0 if the changes will be really deep)
will be realeased I agree with you about someone yelling that they
want admin as before as someone yelled that there was no wysiwyg in
1.5 etc. It's impossible to make everyone satisfied.

If the new admin looks incoporate the wysiwyg stuff and an easy
managmente for upload images and files, with some interface
reoganization it's a price to pay to have new funtions, if someone
doens't like the new admin he can still use the 1.5 having admin in 2
flawors it would be more confusing, harder to support through the
codex documentation every time there is an admin problme you will need
to know what admin inteface is in use, developpers have to manage 2
piece of code for quite everything making it a worste nightmare than
the nightmare support. If the development lines for the admin
interface will be clear and the new admin interface will freezed long
time before the realease of the code, there will be plentu of time for
codex people to set up new pages about it ready to be realesed when
1.6 will be launched.

What happened when Dashboards recently went down, with tons of post
about that is just due to the fact that most of the users are "idiot"
users, they arrive, they want answer in seconds, they don't care to
check if someone had asked same thing before, it's something you can't
avoid. A good things to have on the forum is funtion for supporter and
adminstrator as you, is to have fuction that allow link a new request
to the older same request already solved, maybe an easy way to have
some preformatted answer that need just a click to answer someone
redirecting him to a FAQ page or another post. Some more better
administration function for the forum would help to manage better that
periodically nightmare.

My question is this, why isn't the 1.6 experimental stuff in it's own SVN
branch (or whatever SVN calls it)? That way people could play around with
it and it would still not break the sites that run 1.5 of svn.

I did an SVN update, got 1.6-alpha and now i'm not even allowed to report
a bug that makes all my new posts have a published date in 1970. :(

I might very well have missed something, but right now my site isn't
exactly working.

Usually I just lurk 'cause my own project demands too much time of me to 
fully engange in WP discussion although I do glance over it, but I had 
to react to Tarique.

Tarique,

Forking should be the *LAST* option available for any developer, because 
if everybody just forked at any disagreement we wouldn't have such a 
thriving Free/Libre Open Source Software community. Please try always to 
resolve these matters by discussion and hopefully some form of 
consensus. This will ultimately benefit more people than just forking.


just the 2 cents of a lurker...

So long as every user knows exactly what is happening. Every version so 
far hasn't really changed the admin. This is major surgery.

As things look from where I'm standing, 1.6 should have it's own new 
Codex. 1.5 will be around for a long time yet and trying to have one 
codex for both may well be confusing anyway.

There is never enough time.

Yes we can avoid it - we tell people FIRST.
I know about the people who post without searching - I've been answering 
such posts for well over a year now.

What I see is this:
"We are really pleased to announce the release of WP 1.6
This is the most efficiently coded and most secure version of WP so far."
The word "secure" will be played on in an effort to make people upgrade 
but there will be scant attention given to the impact those changes will 
have.
Remember - it may just be code here but for many if you do this without 
due notice they will justifiably be angry. Sure there is an onus on them 
but WP must do it's bit - it didn't with the upgrade instructions in the 
1.5 file.

Fix what's broken already - and admin isn't broken.

It is in TRUNK (same as CVS HEAD I believe) where it should be, to get
the latest 1.5 I think you need to do:

svn update http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/1.5/

Although I'm new to svn so I'm not sure and I also don't know if the
1.5 tag is for the latest 1.5 or if you need to specify it ie. 1.5.2.

You should use the TAGS not the TRUNK to get last stable versione,
where you can choose all 1.5 flavors realeased till now.

ANd it happesn in sw developement, infact my idea it's that new WP
should be tagged as 2.0 more than 1.something

Not so hard if pages referring to 1.5 will be renamed stating they
refer to 1.5 (ex. X Y Z page will become X Y Z 1.5 and the new X Y Z
will refer to new version, wjhen a page need updates to 1.6 the old
one will be copied to 1.5 one.

That's true but more tha mature the code will be less work will be
necessary to keep it updated if you think how it was few months ago
when moving from old wiki and how it's now...

This unfortunatly has no solution unless someone will be able to
upgrade the "idiot" user brain level to a not buggy one with automatic
search before asking function in theyr brain :)

I can agree this, if substantial user interface will be changed the
announce will have to stress bout these changes, not just with a
textual announce but with pages clearly explaning what's new and
stating that upgrading to new 1.6 will change deep the database (as it
will) and that reverting back won't be possible. If you make this
clear, if codex is rady with basic pages help about the new interface
i think that is done in the right way and people can't complain they
diddn't know, they want go back but didn't make a backup etc.

Maybe upgrade procedure for 1.6 can include a backup of the database
before changing it and have a function to rollback it allowing "never
satisfied people" get back to 1.5 more easily.

>Fix what's broken already - and admin isn't broken.

Actually i can't see any big broken piece in 1.5.1.2... so you suggest
to stay on 1.5x till any little bits is refined and perfect and have
1.6 just a maintenance realease that optimize the code and nothing
else? omeone will come up saiyn: Hey why WP developement stopped, why
no new function why no new nice thing.. why i have to upgrade.. just
for a trimmed code?

Adding WYSIWYG for post and comment and and easy management for upload
images is not fix things broken is evolution, if the admin interface
will be fairly more usable (i mean usable not just make up) it's
evolution too. I repeet we can't satisfy 100% of users, the aim it's
to have the quota of unsatisfied people very very small. It's a
strategy i adopted in 20 years of works in the IT, and was the only
one that pay, thinks that the complaining people are just a little
percentage of the hundred thousands that downloaded WP, unfortunatly
happy people often dont' say a word about it and only complains get
attention.

Maybe a silly question, but... Considering the plugin manager can manage
upgrades yada yada in one click, shouldn't wp do this as well?

I think that was discussed time ago, but was referred more to minor
upgrade than automatically upgrade for a so new version. The Podz
question was more related to support users for news redesing of the
admin interface than to upgrade questions. He wrote a great guide for
upgrading from 1.2x to 1.5 that helped  lot really unexpirienced user
in the job of upgrading, and I'm sure he will do a similar guide for
1.5x to 1.6.

It's not broken, but I think it's not nearly as intuitive as it could
be. It's reminiscent of Windows 3.1 -- massively popular for its time,
and a decent advance over the previous version, but there's still scope
for major improvement.

To make this a bit more constructive: Which parts of WordPress *do* you
regard as "broken"?

I hope they will, your idea should be a must for future version.
WIthout tagging pages for version will make all the hard and big works
codex people did till now totally useless, now that doce are getting
largenr in number, quantity of text and quality would be a suicide not
follow you ideas

By necessity not everything can go into the core. The whole point of the 
plugin system is to allow people to extend WP without including code in 
the core and bloating the codebase with things that may only appeal to a 
limited subset of people. Every highly mature OS project I'm familiar 
with has evolved in a similar way, and the ones that haven't are IMO 
either bloated or a pain to upgrade.

I have no idea what you mean by the b2 remark, it has been in the first 
paragraph of the about page for over two years now and I always talk 
about b2 when people ask about the origins of WP.

So this is when everyone is shifted to linux then ?

There is zero mileage in my responding to this. Spend time in the 
forums, read old posts, use the tags. If you are relying on me to be 
some sort of sole 'voice of the forums' then that is flawed.
I don't care for usability and all the other buzz words, neither do I 
code. I'm good at helping people pick up the pieces and what I do not 
want is to have to have an increase in the forums activity - we simply 
cannot withstand what is proposed without careful planning ahead of 
time. Few people here have a clue about how much work was put in by the 
people in #wordpress and on the forums when 1.5 was released.

It's not just the code that needs managing now, it's the whole project.

Lots of things...

- The plugin system. It should apply to the_post, maybe even the_posts;
never to an out of context the_title.

- The database. Not always consistent, and could be optimized a bit.

- The template system. It is bulky, and makes integration of third party
components less natural than it could be.

- The user system. For reasons discussed here recently.

- The category system. Does social geography fit in geography or sociology?
Nevermind that they fit in both... Categories, posts and pages could be
merged into nodes.

- WP_Query. Could be plugin/module driven, as a consquence of the previous.

- Admin interface. Could be more plugin/module driven too, as a consequence
of the previous.

Then again, as much as I bump into its limits every day, WordPress remains
much less broken than other open source projects. And the admin area is a
lot more usable. Hat to the WP dev team. :)

Fair enough, and I'm not saying that it's not my fault. I would, however,
think that radical changes like the current ones should be done in it's own
branch and tested there before adding it to the main trunk.

Oh well, not that big a deal, just an annoyance.

Please use it before commenting? In my mind there is a strong separation 
between concept and implementation. The concept is something to be 
debated. The current implementation ("unpleasantly long" load times) is 
something that can be improved with time and iteration. (Much like the 
original code for Kubrick was nearly unusable, but got much much better 
with iteration even though the general concept stayed the same.) If 
something *can't* be improved or iterated on, then it is worth 
discussing the validity of the concept itself.

It gives a unified posting interface, instead of an interface that 
switches around semi-randomly based on your options and whether you are 
editing are not. It hides complexity from new users while allowing 
advanced users 95% customizability to get their most common tasks done.

You've advocated things like this before, and to reiterate, *adding 
options is not a good resolution to an argument*. I would rather have 
the developers like you who dislike aspects about the proposed interface 
be annoyed into making it better rather than relegating it into an 
another useless option to confuse new users.

A good test for a new option is: Would you make this a required question 
in the installation? Now picture someone brand new to WordPress -- 
"Would you like the simple or advanced posting screen?"

There is a constant drive for usability and interface enhancements to 
WP, and that will never change. Anything that makes things simpler for 
new users and more powerful for power users is a win in my book.

Before you get excited here, I haven't seen the code either! Someone 
poke Owen. ;) I "delegated" that part of 1.6 to Owen because he had 
already written a really excellent plugin for WP for media handling and 
he was also able to grok the media model for WP. (The post/sub-post 
thing that was discussed on this list ages ago but lost now because it 
wasn't archived in a wiki or blog.) This is also part of me letting go 
of aspects of development to third parties. As soon as I know more about 
the code or get a peek at it, I'll let people know.

See and touch doesn't need to be core code, it can be graphic or HTML 
mockups, or even just ASCII drawings like the other Matt used to do. In 
theory plugins could do this as well, but your point is taken.

The people you see linked when you install WP, currently Dougal, Mike, 
Alex, Michel, Carthik, Ryan, and myself. It's not meant to be 
exclusionary, it's just people who have been around for a really long 
time, have great chops, and who I trust to address things appropriately.

Well trunk by it's nature is pretty much an unstable tag on it's own
and a separate branch is only usually used when working on major
changes that may not be included in the codebase often when there is a
disagreement between the development team, these sometimes become
forks and other times the branch gets incorporated into the main
codebase.

So if you use TRUNK you WILL get breakage guaranteed.

Like I said before, confusing committing with privileges is a mistake. 
Mike has many other privileges, including my trust, respect, and very 
prominent links everywhere. His contributions have always been 
recognized. Commiting != contributing, ANYONE can contribute on the bug 
tracker. Besides, wouldn't more people commiting code directly cause 
more problems like the ones people are pointing out now, action being 
taken in the core without discussion?

Open source collaboration is always going to be multi-modal. If you're 
unwilling to compromise like everyone else, please don't complain.

Firstly, please accept my apologies for unnecessary flames. That remark which

Very true, but not the primary point I was making. I think that 
features can be
voted on so that the outcome better reflects on the desire of _users_.

Admittedly, I would be the last person who can comment on development. 
There are
litterally thousands of people out there who wish contribute; the most one can
do is listen and promote discussion. You have access to many IT professionals
who will give you free advise. We are not mere peons and not only WordPress
Lead (communally speaking) have inexhaustible intelligence. Given the time, I
would have loved to get a widely-exposed Open Source project or 
contribute, but
with 2 jobs and a full-time Ph.D. all I can do is give my opinion on 
occasions.
Sadly, I rarely make impact, e.g. WordPress forums in UseNet do not exist and
the mailing-list archives are not themed to suit WordPress -- something that I
offered I would do in Perl.

It must have escaped me somehow. I trust your honesty, so sorry for all the
fuss...

(I think this is the core of what you're getting at.) This could always 
be more feedback, but I would say it is done more than you give credit 
for. The results are not usually promising. Every week in the IRC 
meetups I've outlined projects outside of core WP that are too much for 
me to handle right now and look for volunteers, every week most are met 
with silence. Even when I contact people directly and get them working 
on something personally, 9 times out of 10 nothing comes of it. (There 
are exceptions, but that is the rule.) Here's a sampling threads I've 
started in the past few months:

* Let's whip WYSIWYG (asking for suggestions)
* New Wiki Tech List (asking for volunteers)
* 3 column theme (asking for suggestions)
* Start of new themes pages ("Ideas? Comments? Suggestions?")
* 1.5.2 or on to 1.6?
* New release ("Any showstoppers?")
* getSelection Workaround (still unanswered)
* Making it better (community feedback on some criticism)
* Pingback block-level awareness (request for code)
* Category project (request for code volunteers)
* XUL Hackers (request for volunteers)
* Importer updates (request for volunteers)

Of the requests about a forth turned into something finished.

I understand people have other committments. However I already spend 
5-10x more time communicating than I do coding, and I feel like things 
have slowed down as a result, which can be frustrating and makes me do 
silly things like write responses after long plane trips and eat $3 
snickers bars in my hotel room. ;)

If people want to help, my philosophy is to get out of the way and let 
them. However I don't think people should propose opening things they're 
not volunteering for, as I can promise that most everything you can 
imagine, from wordpress.org to the source control, has had the keys 
handed over several times before with nothing to show for it. I'll do it 
again because I'm an eternal optimist, but please be serious if you're 
asking for it.

PHP-Nuke incorporates that functionality, so it can be imported from there.
PHP-Nuke already inherits a lot of functionality from phpBB, which 
probably can
fit into WordPress to create a community among site subscribers (important in
blogs/sites that focus on a niche).

Threading of comments is also a key feature, which will contribute enormously,
especially to the WordPress support forums. Have you tried keeping track of
long support threads? It is too linear and could definitely benefit from this
extension.

I would disagree with this entirely. 1.6 will be as much focused on 
blogging as every other release of WP ever was. We're just trying to 
make blogging easier for people.

I would say images and podcasting are very bloggy things.

I would say deficiencies in the admin drive MOST of the support forum 
traffic. I don't see a single screen in the WP admin that I don't think 
could be simpler, easier, or more intuitive. We have come very far, and 
we have a long way to go in this.

There are appropiate forums for different things, to summarize:

* Forums - for support of released final versions
* IRC - for chatting at socializing
* wp-hackers - for discussing development and future versions
* wp-testers - for testers of SVN versions to discuss bugs and such
* wp-docs - documentation
* trac - for bugs
* Codex - for information edited and written for posterity

I read the logs, like I'm sure several others do. I can't stay in IRC 
all the time because it kills my productivity and is very distracting. I 
don't encourage people needing support to go to IRC, I prefer all 
support and people doing support in the forums. I see other developer 
nicks idling there all the time, maybe you don't recognize them?

Chat can be a great enabler for getting things done, but you can't 
expect people to be on it 24 hours a day. That's why we have a set time 
every week set aside for people to get together and collaborate. (The 
IRC meetups.)

I think we need something a little more lightweight and flexible than 
PHP-Nuke, ideally something that fits in with our current user system.

I think threading vs. non-threading is something reasonable and smart 
people can disagree on. Blogging is linear too, but works alright. IMO 
threading encourages off-topic branches of discussion which are not 
conducive to support, and support is the SOLE aim of the forums.

So the devs have to say 'I'm doing this' before doing it? IMO things
work better if we're passive rather than active: if you don't like a
change a dev has made, react. Discussion happening after a change has
made (with a view to a retraction if necessary) will make development
more streamlined.

Amen. Lets drop the forking talk.
 
> I disagree, the decisions are being made: By Matt.

That's just plain wrong. So many threads seem to disappear into the
ether with no decision or no action. Things like the user levels
overhaul still hasn't seen any light, because the discussion has just
stagnated. I think that at this point we need someone to come in and
make an authoritative decision on what to do. Otherwise when
discussion's ran out and everyone's put their ideas forward, nothing
happens.

Discussion is great! The mailing list is just for that -- all the
amazing people in the WP community to come together and give their two
cents. But at the end of the discussion, someone on the comittee needs
to make a decision, for reasons I outlined in my previous paragraph.

> I think my complaints could be addressed by Matt or Ryan joining in (which they

I happen to agree with you here. A dev just adding to a thread saying
'starting implementing this as of <date>' would make a nice addition,
but I do think a WP commitee would be a good thing.

Let me outline my points in a way that unignorable and unconfusable.

Problem: too many threads are just falling away because discussion
comes to a natural end and the output from the thread never makes it
into the source code.
Solution: create a group of decision makers that would review
'finished' threads and say 'Yep, we'll implement that' or say 'No,
that won't happen'. That way no threads are every lost because we know
someone in a place of some importance has read the thread and _will
act on it_.

There's a WP plugin for it here:

My understanding, flawed as it may be, was that wordpress.org runs on 
WordPress (at least partially).

Why?  The old admin interface, while maybe not perfect, was servicable.
 Changes from that foundation can address usability, and workflow,

Installed.  The movable widgets are interesting, but again, what value
does this present to the overwhelming majority of bloggers?

The same variable layout could be accomplished in any of several ways.
Preferably in a way that respected individual author preferences.

Per-user data could include those items that the blog admin allows

As was discussed earlier on the list, a single "SAVE" button, instead of
the three seperate ones ("Save & Continue", "Save" and "Publish") would
easily remedy some of the confusion.

A redesign of the page, taking into some of the consideration of Gabriel
White's review, could easily make good use of the screen real estate
above the fold.  Sliding widgets doesn't really offer much.

Yes, I buy into the "options are bad" argument, insofar as it makes
sense.  But I don't think this is an issue on which it makes sense.

How about a completely plugin-driven post interface?  Plugins present
whatever form(s) they want, and hand the POSTed data off to WP handler
functions for that data, which in turn performs error checking, saving
to the database, etc.  Then we can have as spartan or as fancy an
interface as we want.

My mom uses WordPress, but will never install it; so an install-time
prompt is functionally no different from an Options page prompt for her
(and for anyone else using a hosting-provider-installed WordPress).

I think it makes perfect sense as a checkbox on the user profile page
(provided the user is of sufficient level to write posts).  In this way,
I could configure my mom's blog to have a user account for her, using
the simple controls, and leave the admin account set for advanced
controls for me.

Are you seriously asserting that sliding widgets improves usability?

I agree wholeheartedly with your second sentence above.  I just don't
think that this approach really makes thing simpler.


I think of my mom with regard to "regular" bloggers.  My mom's going to
freak out when she accidentally slides one of the widgets without
realizing she's done so.  She doesn't expect web-based interfaces to be
drag-and-drop.
Sure, a certain amount of education will overcome some of this; but I
see nothing in the current design that will make her a happier blogger.

Now, if -- on the post screen -- my mom could dynamically resize the
textbox for post entry, she might be impressed.

This is still a better interface than old, fragmented one.

I disagree. If we have the two-interfaces setup again, we haven't
really moved forward. Besides, from the users perspective, there's not
really much distinction between the interfaces: 'Would you have blue
boxes or grey boxes?' Does that sound like a valuable option to you?

I think this is a case for customisability where it's not called for.
The majority of bloggers will be happy with this interface, and if you
really want customisation, edit the core (or write a plugin, there
should be enough hooks).

Keep in mind that WP prides itself on the 5-minute install.

Agreed. The usability of the new interface needs to be debated.
Doesn't mean we should give up the entire interface, though.

Sorry to make this thread linger on, but I feel as if I must take a few ideas
off my mind. Discussion such as this is more idealogical than 
technical, but it
probably makes the difference between the dark room, code-monkey 
projects (which
often fail BTW) and projects that encourage people to promote and participate.

I wanted to bring this up before, but held back. Would releasing parallel,
distinct, yet related editions of WordPress be a possibility? Downloading a
light-weight version of WordPress and hacking it is analogous to 
building Linux
from scratch, rather than getting comprehensive distributions like Fedora,
Mandrake or SuSE. At its core, all is the same.

Many bloggers disagree. I could list many entries where people complain about
the lack of hierarchy and inter-connectability (apart from the artificial SEO
bits).

I would argue that the contrary is true. Off-topic is /easier/ to ignore. You
just cull out the significant branch.

Things they can't access are already hidden. Having the controls inline 
with the interface saves us yet another configuration screen with yet 
another interface. People with far more resources than us, like 
Google/ig and My Yahoo have taken this exact same approach, I think we 
would be unwise to ignore their research and testing in this area. I'll 
be getting some more in-person feedback at Gnomedex as well, I keep the 
screen cached on my laptop.

Gabriel White's review as well as several others are playing a role. I 
also think WP will be a project at the next FLOSS usability sprint, 
which will include some of the most widely respected and professional 
interaction experts in the bay area. (And actual user testing.)

I would hate the first question in any support thread to be "what 
interface are you using?"

I meant in hypothetically, as a test for if something was important 
enough, not an actual suggestion.

I don't think any "widget" improves anything. But I think the simpler 
default interface is simpler and more usable. I think having one 
interface is better than N +1. I think that if customizability can be 
lightweight and non-intrusive, that's a *great* thing. I believe that 
things should still work with JS off, and they do. I also believe there 
is a lot left to do.

This should be in relatively soon, I have the code working but I'm 
trying to constrain it to vertical expansion and not horizontal expansion.

I don't think WP is enough like an operating system to warrant different 
distributions in the same way. People are welcome to do it, but I think 
officially we should focus on one thing and make that as great as possible.

After an evening to reflect on the position of things and hear Matt 
defend himself from all comers, I want to present my thoughts to the 
group for comment.

I'll admit to being the one responsible for the initial "unpleasantly 
long" comment.  I did test the code, and this was one of the things I 
left out of the report I posted on my blog.

It is very important to note that the underlying changes (which Matt 
points out) that prompted the javascript/collapsible interface are 
**such a good development event** that the collapsible panels are almost 
a footnote.  We can make the collapsible stuff better - prettier or less 
intrusive.  But something of this nature is going to be a requirement to 
support the underlying improvements in the posting interface.

For the uninformed, the new interface unifies the advanced and simple 
posting pages into a single code path.  This reduces the overall code 
used, which makes the code more stable and readable.

The major objection I have to the current codeset (not that it can't be 
improved) is that the interface is largely unusable until the collapsing 
javascript executes.  These extra javascript modules (Dojo, if used, 
will be a big offender) are rather large, and take a "while" to process 
even on my heftier desktop system.  It's a sore point in the code 
execution.  If we're looking for constructive criticism on the trunk 
code, my initial thought is that this needs to be much faster.

As far as the look of it goes...  I'm certainly no design expert.  The 
chief idea behind the javascript code seems to be "retain the old 
functionality".  This entails hiding the advanced interface by default 
and allowing the user to set their preference of what appears.  Indeed, 
the new interface does this *better* than the old, since you can hide 
and show the parts by default as you require, and these settings "stick".

I actually sent Matt an email a while back with a few questions on this 
that I hadn't received a response to, and I stalled.  If you like, Matt, 
I will gladly write up the concept and present it to the list for comment.

I feel mostly responsible for keeping these feature additions under 
wraps, since I agreed with Matt's idea of having something to play with 
before letting everyone here pick over it.  I'm sorry that I've been a 
party to keeping potential players out of the loop.  If you have 
specific ideas about the media management components you want to discuss 
or suggest (and I am sure some will attest to my openness on this - 
skippy, mdawaffe, et al), please email me and I will happily discuss 
them with you.

At this point I would interject a few items.  First, I disconnected from 
all of these WordPress lists and meetings for a few weeks while dealing 
with many issues, and I'm still not convinced that jumping back in now 
is a great idea.  But I see that WordPress the community needs some 
bolstering, and as it's really (sometimes sadly) the only cause I've 
been able to stand behind, I'm here right now.

That said, it should be obvious that I didn't get the memo about not 
writing about 1.6.  Oh well.  (In my defense, I wouldn't even have known 
about it if I hadn't seen Ryan's post in the Dashboard.)  I've received 
a lot of good comments about the new interface based on the animated 
screen shots I took.  To my recollection, nobody commented negatively, 
and I only received one question of, "Release date?"  As if I would know 
the answer to that!

I agree with the simple idea that Mike presents about sharing the idea 
of, "Here's what's going to happen with WordPress."  A 'heads-up', if 
you will.  That's why I didn't see any problem in writing my post, with 
all of the added caveats that a pre-alpha requires.  Although everything 
that I discussed was obvious from the SVN mailing list, it's often not 
apparent what a chunk of code does, and the notes that go with committed 
code are often too short to describe what is really going on and why.

After reading the replies here, I believe that Matt intended the commit 
of the new interface as a discussion point, not as something firm in 
stone that we'd have to live with.  There have been instances in the 
past where committed code has seemed to be beyond discussion, which is 
why I think everyone took the code commit as gospel.

Can we all possibly agree that the current 1.6 in SVN is a prototype 
rather than the actual deal?  That we're all going to get our chance to 
debate its merits?  It's better to see actual working code and 
understand what is in mind than discuss hypotheticals unendingly?  I 
don't intent to be snarky, but if you want the code to be different than 
how it is, you need to not only defend your position, but provide at 
least as much working code as your opposition so that others may weigh 
the merits of both options.

Assuming the SVN list/Trac describes an evolving prototype, and that it 
is still possible to rollback these changes, is that enough of a 
description of where the project is going?  What suggestions do you all 
have for monitoring the project direction?

Some minimal effort to get ideas flowing would be more than useful. 
"I'm starting to code X now, and here's my plan..."  Even I find this 
distracting from my style of just coding the solution freestyle, but a 
simple message like this would sure be useful to people who want to be 
in the loop.  Who knows, you might even get some great suggestions about 
implementation that you hadn't even considered.

Also, devs need to at least seem willing to roll-back changes based on 
thoughtful debate.  If it turns out that this collapsible thing is not 
feasible, we're going to need a suggestion to take its place.  Someone's 
going to have to code that.  I can understand the unwillingness to 
consent to roll back such significant changes, but provided that civil 
discussion results in good arguments against it, the option should 
always be available, at least until a Code Freeze (a topic for another 
time).  The idea for official polling on these contentious ideas is a 
good one, as long as we can all live with the poll results.

Is that enough commentary for today?  Why do I always write a book?

Owen

Alright, the article has been completely rewritten, according to the 
suggestions made by all.

It uses a combination of everyone's ideas, and I think it turned out quite 
well. Thanks for all the help!

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Jalenack/Creating_Tables_with_Plugins

Now, any more suggestions/quibbles with it?

Cause if you will test it before you will notice that posting panel
it's not so gimmickery, but allow people have the whole advanced user
interface shorter windows (less scroll need) easy arrangement for
puttin in vidence things that people use etc.

Maybe you will find it not perfect, and maybe you will suggest how to
improve it. Saiyng thqt the old one was not perfect bot workable and
there is no need to change it it's pointless.

Check it and you will see that it does what are you talking about,
arrange things in a way the single blogger like... and it's just a
first step, not the final appearance/functionlity one

I suppose this can be accomplished with the new interface too, how
many blogger (not tecchy ones, I mean the under the average user, and
they are motre than the 50% of WP audience i think) will mess with
plugins that maybe interact not perfectly? I don't think so, and what
nightmare would be for support people in forum ansswer questions about
things like that when on 100 people asking help 75 of them have 75
different plugin inteface ruynnibg? A really big terrible nightmare.

A clean screen, easy to understand, that have all the necessary
functions already present, arranged in a nice way too (consider that
product have to be nice not only in a technical way but in a fashion
way too just for marketing reason) that's nice pluggable for advanced
user it's the answer, and I think the way taken for 1.6 should answer
to this request.

Sliding maybe not improve improve usability as WYSIWYG, but it neither
reduce it, it makes the Write page simplier, hiding to first time user
some "strange" option but making them availabel when users after a
period of usage get curious about what there is down there.

Actually an user can stick to simple write page screen without knowing
at all about advanced function for years. Yu will have to analize the
whole new screnn immagine it with WYSIWYG editorn in place, with image
upload there too... not just pointing your finget to "sliding" stuff,
the same page could be done without sliding stuff but same design,
it's like have leather seat in a car, it works even without leather...
but it's a nice addendum that I don't think involved developpers to
spend weeks on developping it, but make the new WP kepp going with new
stuff appearing around.

Obviusly if sliding stuff will be the only innovation it would be
useless... but it's not so why just stress on it, without having teste
the whole new cake? :)

AFAIK, from what I've read about svn, the 1.5.1.2 branch should be 
copied to something like /branches/1.5.x/ so that any future bug fixes 
goes on in there. From what I understand, all major code changes go on 
in /trunk/ and before you start developing the next version, you copy 
your current /trunk/ (same time you make your last tag, or copy from the 
last tag if done later) to a folder within /branches/ The reasoning for 
that is so that if need-be, you can update the 1.5.x branch while 
developing 1.6 or whatever matt is versioning it as.

All it takes to develop for WP is to TURN OFF your email/lists for a couple 
of hours and get some CODING done. Submitting code and submitting bug 
reports are productive actions.

Matt, I'll clean up and finalize the new Blogger import script and upload it 
for inclusion in 1.6. I've been supporting it for a few months via my blog. 
It has been clicked more than 650 times and the comments attest to its

I agree -- but with SVN branches and tags are really the same thing,
so if there are fixes to the tagged version, you can either

1) commit on top of the tag, and it will behave like a branch

2) use "svn copy" to make another "copy" in /branches/ using the tag
   that is already there (or any revision number)

I know you've done some of this, but you have to bear in mind that
something you've been thinking of for a few days, and maybe discussed
with a couple of people, then thrown out in a single request in the
middle of three other conversation might not mean a whole lot to
people.  It's no wonder you don't get people jumping up immediately.
Plus you have the other problem with IRC, if you're not there at the
time you miss it. Whilst the codex logs are great, a summary sent to
the mailing list, especially requests looking for volunteers, would I
think be much more productive.

I am aware too that I'm asking for more work to be done that I'm not
able to do myself. I wish I could do more, like the old days. I wish I
could even articulate why I can't do more, but that's not to be. I'm
working on it...

I know you throw things out sometimes. I volunteered to help with the
theme garden. In the middle of working on the first theme, I see you'd
already checked in changes for two of the three you asked me to work
on.
I know I'm not as quick as you and I can't spend as much time as I
like working on this stuff, but I feel like I've been slapped for not
working quick enough!
I'm sure its just me being too sensitive but...

I know you do this and I contribute when I feel I can, and I see that
a lot of it comes to nothing. But it's when I see things like a whole
new admin interface being checked in without any discussion (or even a
note to say "I've checked this in as a discussion point, bang away on
it and give me feedback") that I get shocked.
That's when it feels like nothing anyone else says has value and only
your opinions count.

I know how frustrating this can be, but that up front discussion, if
controlled, can make the first pass at cutting the code SO much more
productive. You've already got a consensus of opinion, you've already
had the bad ideas dismissed and the good ideas you didn't think of
suggested.

I'm working on it... I get immensely frustrated just trying to keep up
the mailing lists and the dashboard and the codex, and supporting my
own meager offerings to the WP world..

Matt, don't stop what you are doing -- its inspiring. I wish I could
be as productive as you are. Just consider a little more communication
every now and then ;-)

With everything changing for 1.6, I *really* feel a need for a seperate stable 
branch. WordPress is by its interpreted nature a true dream to keep updated 
through SVN; but when the DB tables starts changing it really isn't that much 
fun any more.

What are the reasons for not branching, if any?

Because the 1.5.1.2 tag exists, and works:
  svn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/1.5.1.2

That's your stable version.

If you do an svn co of a tag, eg 1.5.1.2
And then there's another tag, eg 1.5.1.3

You can't get the letter by doing an svn up on a checkout of the former.

If there was a stable branch, eg /branch/1.5.1.x

You check it out and do svn up on that branch to get the latest tag.

That said, changing development methodology just for easy updating for 
advanced users isn't the best of ideas. If WP is not branching at all 
and there will be no more updates in the 1.5.1.x line, making a branch 
for it won't be of any use.

But aren't tags permanent? What happens when the next security vulnerability 
gets discovered in 1.5.x (e.g. 1.5.1.3)? My point being that it is easier to 
track a branch than to follow the tagging, fetch new tags, replace them, etc.

(And yes, in general I'm against running multiple branches with projects of 
WordPress' size, but when trunk hits unusable states like this, it really is 
a better solution IMHO)

There probably should be at least a branch/1.5.1, it should be fairly
easy to create just by copying tags/1.5.1.2 then fixes takes place in
the branch for the stable version and when ready for a release the
next 1.5.1.X tag can be created.

Any chance of getting that in place? A lot of people like to use SVN
for it's ease of use but don't want to use TRUNK and if they have to
switch between checkouts then SVN loses it's ease of use for upgrading
a WP install in place.

I'd opt for x.y branching, e.g. a 1.5 branch. I'm thinking a new branch when 
DB layout changes or other things break compat with previous versions (which 
is OK for x.y versions bumps but, IMHO, not x.y.z bumps.)

BTW: How does the 1.5.1.x tags get... uhm... tagged now?

To clarify, there have been no tags in the 1.5.1.x path since this 
major-change checkin to the trunk. If there will be a minor update, it 
probably won't be from the trunk.

Subject: [wp-hackers] MU Progress
Message-ID: <42BB38A9.6060900@linux.ie>

Hi all,

I thought I should bring you up to speed on what's been happening in the 
MU world of late. (If you don't know what WPMU is, take a look at 
http://mu.wordpress.org .. go on, I'll wait while you read! Back? Oh good!)
The ongoing discussion on openness reminded me that I need to volunteer 
some information now and again so as I can keep people up to date and 
hopefully pick your brains on difficult matters.

The last week has seen several huge changes in WordPressMU. What I'm 
discussing below is very seperate from WordPress. The two projects share 
a lot of code, but they're very different beasts.

1. I created a global "blogs" table. This table stores details about all 
the blogs on a system. It even handle multiple installations on one 
domain or across domains hosted on the one machine! It should be 
possible to install WPMU once, and then access it by different domains!
2. There's a global users table. Once you register on the system, you 
*could* get access to any of the blogs on that machine if the blog owner 
allowed it! You could even have different permissions in each blog!
3. The usermeta table is rather handy - it's a global table describing 
users. Matt put the user_level in there, prepended by the table prefix 
which facilitates having different permissions on different blogs on 
different domains! You could be a level 10 user on 
http://www.example.com/joesblog/ but only a level 0 visitor on 
http://www.anotherexample.com/marysblog/ and all driven from the same 
data source! Kind of exciting eh? :)
It takes the same form as the options table, so it's very expandable. It 
has the same name/value fields. Next to go in will be the usual suspects 
such as IM addresses, urls, etc.
4. Up until recently I used the blog name in the database table 
filenames, but because of the global blogs table mentioned above I've 
changed things so it uses the blog_id instead. Tables aren't as easy to 
maintain in phpmyadmin, but logically they match the records in the 
blogs table.
5. Themes! I've always been a fan of Smarty templates, but there are 
such a wealth of really great WordPress themes out there it was a shame 
WPMU couldn't use them. WP theme support has come along in leaps and 
bounds in the last year and it was a simple change so that WPMU can use 
them. It's read-only right now, but that will change.

*phew* those are only a few of the recent changes.
I still haven't thought about how the global userlist will be able to 
interact with a blog. Probably as a paged list with a search box and 
checkboxes?
What about global categories? If multiple blog authors post to the same 
global category it would be simplicity itself to create feeds of that 
subject, or narrow site searches, or any number of things! Could you 
limit the categories to certain named blogs? Have an administrator who 
lets blogs in?

I'm off to bed, 'night!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin Localization
Message-ID: <42BB4488.40406@ryanduff.net>

It came up in #wordpress this afternoon about the placement of the .mo 
files for plugins. Currently they need to reside in the 
wp-content/plugins/ folder which causes uglyness.

One option is to allow the plugin authors to keep them in the plugin 
folder. Its pretty much the same as current, but more flexible. In this 
case, the .mo should be located in either wp-content/plugins/ or 
wp-content/plugins/<plugin sub dir>/ As stated before, this can cause 
ugliness unless in the main plugins folder unless the author makes a 
sub-directory for the plugin files.

The second option is to throw them all in wp-content/language/<locale>/ 
directory. This seems to make more sense in the current situation since 
the plugin_textdomain is usually set to the same prefix that the plugin 
uses to prefix functions. this would lead to a .mo file of <plugin 
prefix>-<domain>-<locale>.mo and you could easilly tell which file went 
with which plugin. The only downside is now we have files in 2 places 
and leads to the same issue we had with admin pages residing in 
/wp-admin/ and also extra files when removing the plugin.

Which makes more sense in the long run?

Sounds like the plugins/<plugin sub dir>/ approach would be the best for the 
long haul, as anything custom translated for a plugin should stay WITH the 
plugin.

I've also gotten requests to put my multi-file plugins into single folders 
for easier management, which mirrors the same issue (clutter & 'packaging').

There isn't any 1.5 development to track at the moment.  If we need to
do 1.5.1.3, we can create a 1.5 branch from the 1.5.1.2 tag.  Basically,
I haven't created a branch because we haven't needed to commit anything
for the 1.5 series.  Every commit since 1.5.1.2 has been for 1.6.

Thats my pick of the two. We've begun to throw wp-contact-form into a 
folder to keep all the files together. Cleaner for the dev and the user. 
One folder to upload, one folder to delete.

Maybe something like this for an updated load_plugin_textdomain() 
function to check if the plugin resides in a sub-folder...

function load_plugin_textdomain($domain) {
     $locale = get_locale();
     $plug_dir = dirname(__FILE__);
		
		if ($plug_dir != 'plugins') {
				$mofile = $plug_dir . "$domain-$locale.mo";
		} else {
				$mofile = ABSPATH . "wp-content/plugins/$domain-$locale.mo";
		}

     load_textdomain($domain, $mofile);
}


rboren: any comments?

Should probably have a bit of testing to see if the file exists
outside the folder just in case, a legacy support thing.

I agree, it should add the added ability, yet stay completely

Well that sounded dumb...

It should have the added ability and keep the backward-compatibility.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP Management (was: WordPress Openness)
Message-ID: <1959130b05062320064cf578e6@mail.gmail.com>

I have followed this entire discussion and I have to say that I felt
the same things that Mike Little has expressed. You did make a request
about the direction of development, Matt, with your "1.5.2 or on to
1.6?" post, but much of that discussion went untouched and was never
met with an adequate response (IMHO). This wasn't an isolated
incident, but rather a trend.

Many of the issues addressed in this current discussion, especially
those in reference to SVN access and code changes, were already
addressed by my reply to Matt's aforementioned post, but I received no
replies.

I will re-post my response verbatim here and open it up to discussion
under this new light, as many of the issues I was anticipating have
indeed come under the microscope and I think there might be some value
in my suggestions or it might at least spawn some constructive
discussion:

Firstly, I think the bug system needs to be stabilized and organized
before any talk of development progress is made. A custom field needs
to be added to the new ticket system in Trac for a "Patch?" boolean.
At that point, all bugs that are assigned and have patches should be
immediately committed and tested for a 1.5.2 release.

After that, a huge effort needs to be put into assigning,
prioritizing, and triaging the bug list [1]. I don't know exactly how
many people have privileges on the bug system, but it seems to be a
very small number. I think the team needs to allow more people to help
with triaging and organizing in Trac. "Bug days" like those over on
irc.mozilla.org could help this process along greatly.

Also, I think it would be good to set up a "review" and "super-review"
system whereby contributing developers can get their bugs approved by
core devs and can commit their own changes to the tree. Having only
two developers commit changes makes development slow and disorganized
and I think WordPress needs to look ahead to the future where there is
a much larger developer community behind it. Of course in the meantime
it would still be simpler with only Matt and Ryan committing if they
could pull up a list of all bugs with a patch and r+sr, allowing them
to commit and move on to the test cycle.

After the bug system is worked out, all of these new features in the
Version 1.6 wiki entry can be added to Trac and prioritized.

With a stable 1.5.2 release behind us, we can then start to make the
larger changes slated for 1.6. I do think that we should definitely go
toward 1.6 and maintain backwards-compatibility, however. Software
that breaks b-c too often and increments major version numbers
regularly ends up in a bad position (v13.0 sucks).

In summary, I think we need organization and a clear set of goals and
development processes before moving ahead to the next release. (Just
my four cents.)

Nice to see everything resolved in an amicable manner.

Yes! I agree FORKING is the last option and should almost never be done 
without discussion - but on the other hand I do not like wasting time on 
endless discussion from people which theorize but never show me a better 
piece of code OR worse when asked for the code say you code it :(

Like many on this thread my reaction was also a hangover from something 
similar in another project of mine.

BTW Matt I like Committing != Privileges

This would likely be a support nightmare. If you do want a lightweight
version of WordPress, see LightPress.

That's what I'd imagined (support nightmare) and that's why I held back. I can
think of a few exceptions where the nature of software is different. 
Noah Lite,
for example, is a Palm English-English dictionary which ships as 3 different
editions with varying database sizes. Since no alteration in code is involved,
very little can go wrong, and _yet_ there's a choice.

Regarding Matt's comment, he was quite right. The O/S analogy is poor 
because of
the big difference in scale.

Could you post it to this list? It's a bit more exlusive than the

With respect, I have no idea who subs to this list, save that the

I have no idea, but if it is then it just shows that the method is 
getting around. Maybe some posts that hit the Dashboards are in order ? 
Pointless saying much in the forums - they get nagged enough to upgrade 
or they read the nagging. It's what the Dash was for ?

The string is used by a perl script that uses the Category security 
vulnerability mentioned in the above dev blog post. I have tried the 
script on "fixed" blogs and the fix holds up. For all those interested 
in the script, please email me. Interestingly, if the wp_ prefix is 
changed to something particular to every user, this can be avoided in 
the future (since the table named will be different for all WP blogs).

Should we add a page in the install process that forces the users to 
choose a unique table prefix?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Compose Screen
Message-ID: <42BC0D83.2010009@skippy.net>

I really don't like the movable widgets in the new post interface.  The
old screen wasn't perfect; but I think it was acceptable.

To put my money where my mouth is, I mocked up a static "Compose" screen:
  http://www.skippy.net/blog/wp-content/post.html

At 1024x768 resolution, most of the important stuff fits above the fold.

Items to note:
* I've removed the sub-menu for "Write Post" and "Write Page".  This
screen is just "Compose".  From this screen you choose what the final
disposition will be.

* The post-slug field could use some javascript magic to automatically
fill in, based on the post title.  Obviosuly previous posts of the same
name will alter the post slug; so maybe AJAX here?  Or remove this
option altogether?  After all, options are bad.

* There's still some wiggle room for shuffling things around above the
post composition field.  I realize I forgot to put the comments/pings
checkboxes back in -- they probably should go after the date section.

* There is only a single SAVE button.  Next to that you choose what
you're saving.  Since Pages live in the posts table, and since lots of
people ask to be able to save drafts of Pages, I think this works well.:
everything is saved as a draft until you choose otherwise.
(This does not address the request for Pages to be categorized, despite
using a unified interface...)

I'm sure lots of people on this list will be happy to tear this proposal
apart, since it's only a modest step beyond the original post screen.
Please show me something substantially better.

'Write' makes more sense IMO. We're not writing an email here. Emails
are more message-like, blog posts are more article-like.

Or underneath the category section.

* Put the author fieldset in the 'Advanced' section. I don't
understand why I'd want to write as anyone other than me, so I'd
personally remove it completely, but I assume there's some reason for
its existance.
* I'd prefer to seperate mulitple URIs in the 'send trackbacks'
section with newlines in a textarea.
* Come to think of it, I think most users don't know what a URI is.
Stick to URLs.
* I see you've removed the 'edit timestamp' checkbox. Good :)
* Rename 'Excerpt' as 'Optional Excerpt'.

Other than that, I like it. It'd probably load a fair bit faster than
the new interface as well :)

This sounds like you want a category system like Drupal's. I'd very much
like for this not to happen! Wordpress is not, and should not be, a CMS.
Keep it simple.

Everyone understands a hierarchical category system, and is aware of the
limitations. The deficiencies aren't worth the added complexity of some
enormous and confusing taxonomical system, in my mind.

Just to clarify, I hope you're suggesting that modifying the post-slug
be moved to the Advanced Edit screen, rather than removing it
completely? I know I use it.

Any reason to put all those controls above the post text field than 
below it and above save? They're a bit overwhelming. As in, if I hit 
write, I'd like to put in a title and just start writing.

Right now, you have

I'd do

[Draft/Published/Private] [Page/Post] | Save |

Hmm... I originally thought that we should remove it altogether, but
perhaps thinking about it it would serve a better purpose in the
advanced section.

I was thinking how most posts are displayed on blogs:
   Post title, published @ timestamp by so-and-so
   in the following categories

Besides, the top-portion of the existing Write / Edit screen has a lot
of whitespace at the top.

Preparing the post can easily follow the same format.  The bits you
don't need are off to the side.  Enter a title, and then click (or tab)
down to the text entry area.

How many folks are using private posts?  I don't entirely understand the
value of private posts.

Maybe if we could roll in "user levels" with private posts, we could
keep "Draft / Page / Post", and introduce a new control to set the
minimum level required to see the post / page.

Awesome!

What if I want to add a new category for this post, but _also_ assign it
to an existing category?

Can your new form be AJAX-ified so we could make a new category for
immediate insertion into the list without clobbering any post data?

Speaking of which, can the post-meta section be AJAX-ified, to
streamline the inclusion of meta data?

Perhaps the trackback field could be re-designed to allow newlines
instead of spaces.  It could then use one half of the screen, and other
advanced controls (or post meta) could live on the other half?

Hm, I don't see the problem. You pick up the two $_post variables that 
define the new category and its parent, make the new category, then pick 
up the ids of the other selected categories, add the new category's id 
to that list, and assign the categories to the post.

The field for the Post should be about half the height in my opinion
and you could add a button so you could open just that field up in a
new window for more room to edit or make the height resizable like
Matt is already working on.

Personally the draggable/collapsible widgets don't really do anything
for me either and I think if we are just smarter about the layout then
the screen can work a lot better.

My published posts wouldn't be organized visually the same as everyone 
else's.  We wouldn't want to change the Write page for every theme. 
Best to organize the page by most significant details on top (title, 
content) and move everything else down or off to the side.

I would like to see this, too.  Something would be nice that didn't 
display every category all the time, or could be dual-purposed for 
categories and tags, should a plugin (or core code) support tagging.

What was the original reason for showing this?  Anyone know?

Which would be fine except that there isn't (currently) a 
differentiation between a Draft Page and a Draft Post.  There really 
doesn't need to be.

Incidentally, this quirk of UI would allow you to swiftly move a Post to 
a Page, which is a feature I like.

As mentioned in the original note though, Pages will need to be 
categorized.  The user should be allowed to choose a Page Parent for a 
new Page.

I use private posts often.  I use it when I want to write something that 
only I can read, which is useful since I use my blog not only as a 
public exhibition, but as a pseudo-diary as well.

There are plugins that get most of this done.  For example: 
http://fortes.com/2005/01/22/introducingpostlevels/

Remember, if you add Ajax-enabled stuff that it has to degrade.  So a 
sub-form that allows you to create a new category on the fly has to also 
work without the Ajax.  Ajaxifying the custom field form would be neat.

Also remember that existing plugin hooks on these forms should continue 
working for the plugins that use them.  I don't see any problems yet, 
but it's something to note.

It might also be nice, while redesigning this form, to keep in mind that 
we may eventually like to style this thing with CSS differently than 
what it looks like now.  I'm not a fan of heavy image design in my 
admin, but I do use Joe Kohlmann's pretty admin CSS plugin.  It might be 
a good idea to keep things loose enough so that if someone wanted to 
implement collapsible panels (via plugin, say), they could.

A question about the function of the Save button-  When you click it, 
what happens?  Does it return to the prior page?  Does it re-display the 
Write page?  Does it forward to the post itself?  Is it dependent on the 
option set for the post_status?

No point getting the user to choose it when a random string can easily
be generated. But yes, I think that would be a good idea. It would force
plugins to be properly compatible too.

If it's a randomly selected prefix, the support conversations will
become more complicated.  Let the user choose their own prefix.

I would suggest that we ask for some digits - say 5 - that is then added 
to the 'wp' prefix. We can't ask users to choose a prefix in case of 
some collision (unless that is handled very well indeed) but if they 
choose a number then together with the 'wp' it will be unique.
wp12345_ would be okay would it not ? Just as wpmypet_ would be.

There's never going to be an interface that satisfies everyone.  I was
shooting for "good enough".  Titles, timestamps, and post contents are
what I consider to be fundemental elements of a post.  I more often
change timestamps than I do post slugs.

Keeping all these elements in one horizontal row makes it easy to access
those items you use, and easy to ignore the ones you don't, without
wasting space.

So you can see when the post was originally (set to be) published.

Yes.  Should the page parent element only show up when the "Page" option
is selected?

That might be a neat trick:
left-align the type drop down, defaulting to draft.
When "Post" is selected, the Post Password input becomes available in
between the type drop-down, and the save button.
Whent "Page" is selected, the page parent input becomes available.

Yes, and it's been a fairly frequently requested core feature.  It
provides another benefit for registering to the blog.  Currently the
only real benefit is to write posts.
(I've not seen too many blogs that require registered users to post
comments.)

Maybe instead of Ajaxing it, all the submit buttons _except_ SAVE will
post all the page data (post, cats, title, etc etc) to itself, update
meta / new-categories / etc, and re-display the form, with everything
user-entered intact.  Make sense?

Hrm... I was about to say "In this way, only the SAVE button would
actually commit the post to the database", but that won't entirely work,
since post_meta requires a post ID... I'm sure someone can devise a nice
solution to this.

Ideally, yes; but I'm not entirely opposed to breaking admin plugins, as
long as we announce well ahead of time that the underlying structure has
changed.  Announce it early, publish the new functions / features, and
let plugin authors update.

What do you want it to do?

When you click "Save" in your word processing application, you're not
returned to a main menu.  I think that clicking "SAVE" in the write
screen should commit the data to the database, and return you to the
same page, filled with the contents you just saved.

I'd go with:

  [*Draft*/Post/Page/Private] | Save |

As others stated, Draft should be the default, and there is little to no 
difference between a Draft Post and Draft Page (with the exception of 
categories and parents.) However, for the purpose of keeping it around 
until you are sure where to put it, a general "draft" format should be 
acceptable.

The "private" setting definately has value that, AFAIK, very few people 
are aware of. Setting a post to "private" will allow the post to show up 
on the blog like it was published, but only for you (cookie detection). 
This is *real* nice for testing actual formatting and such.

However, you then run into the issue then, that Private Posts exists, 
but there is no similiar option of Private Pages.

So, if that option were added (Private Pages -- which would be nice) 
then I'd go back to:


  [Draft/Published/Private] [Page/Post] | Save |


Speaking of which, with a unified design like this, how will the concept 
of "pages vs. posts" be dealt with in regard to "categorized vs. 
parented"? Neither of the two mockups placed on the list in this thread 
have dealt with that.

Or just, uhm, check the little box next to both categories? Kinda with 
Graeme here -- it may have some limitations, but they aren't many and 
the current setup works for probably 98% of people who blog.

Just some technical details.  __FILE__ in this context will always
be .../wp-includes/wp-l10n.php, not the plugin file.  __FILE__ needs to
be passed to load_plugin_textdomain(), perhaps as an optional second
argument.

I more often change titles and contents than timestamps.  I suspect the 
same is true for you.  It's just not something I would group so high on 
the page.  Post-dated posting seems like something Advanced to me.

It's not really a big issue to me.

I was unclear.  The form fields already show this information.  So was 
there a reason why it was deemed necessary to do it for this field when 
none of the other fields do it?  (There's no "Current Post Slug")  If 
there was a reason, then maybe we should consider that in the design. 
If not, then chuck it.

Neat, sure.  Still, javascript has to degrade nicely, so those fields 
will both appear in a browser that has no javascript.

Ok.  Using existing plugin code to implement this should be considered 
both to minimize development time and so that people already using the 
plugin will be minimally affected.

Yes.  Even if you do enable the form that way, you can still add Ajax 
for browsers that would support it.  It just has to degrade nicely.

[This is one of the things I never got about Ajax.  If you have to code 
everything so that browsers that don't support Ajax still work, then 
you're practically writing server-side code twice just to enable both 
the standard form submissions and the Ajax features that save you, what? 
  Forcing the user to reload a page by instead loading something in the 
background?  I'm still unclear on the true benefits of applying Ajax to 
a feature that isn't going to exclusively operate via Ajax.]

It will be difficult to add new metadata via Ajax to posts that have not 
yet been saved unless there is some ID already reserved for that post 
somehow.

It would be nice if the code somehow reserved a post ID before the Write 
page was generated.  Very nice.  Especially if you're trying to attach 
sub-posts or metadata to a post that is not currently complete.  Someone 
else please write this code because I'm tired of messing with it and I 
need it like a chrackwhore needs her fix.  Yes, I will totally do you if 
you hook me up.

Makes sense.  It's usually better to emulate common behavior.  Although 
I do like when I click on "edit" on the published post and then Save 
after making changes how it returns me to the published post so I can 
see the results.

This is faux-security, by adding unnecessary complication. I don't think

Nope. You pretty much got it. There are cases where you simply say "AJAX 
  or get off my code" but in most instances you are doing what 
JavaScript ought to be doing: adding additional behaviour/functionality 
on top of a a solid foundation.

I *know* that AJAX in the case of something like AutoSaving would be a 
hugely awesome item on the "Feature" list. Both in the fact that I want 
it, no one else (I know of) has it, and the attraction of not loosing 
posts anymore to an average user would be tremendous.

But, yeah, it does require coding twice (or if you're smart and 
abstracted, maybe 1.5 times) to add that extra little feature -- but in 
a number of cases I think it's worth it. After all, a group of, what, 
300 people work on the WordPress core with maybe 10-30 actually coding, 
but hundreds of thousands benefit from that 1.5times the work...I think 
we can handle it.

No, it's not a big deal to me, either; but I know a lot of folks do
twiddle timestamps.  As long as it's above the fold, I don't think there
will be a huge problem.

If you adjust the timestamp on an existing post, then move on (without
saving) to edit content, and finally (before saving) decide to review
all your changes, it would be nice to compare the original timestamp to
what you entered, without having to memorize it.

Either display the original, or provide a "reset" button, to restore
whatever was there before.

It would be super nice if this form could be a text form, allowing input
in the format the user has specified in their options.  That
significantly complicates things for little real benefit, though.

Sure; I can agree to that.  The postlevels plugin for fortes.com uses
post-meta, so we're not introducing any structural changes to the
database for this feature.

Some folks are hell-bent on keeping their post IDs in order.  Is there
any value to adding a new "drafts" table, which can hold all the drafts,
so people can use their post IDs without worry?

If you arrived at the edit screen from a published post page in the
non-admin display of your blog, then clicking save should preserve the
current behavior, and return you to the non-admin display.

Me too. But I don't understand why this would cause havoc for support if
it was randomly generated? Skippy, can you explain please?

Many folks don't know about MySQL _at all_, and some aspects of WP
management still require using a tool like phpMyAdmin.

Asking them to find the "random string of letters" makes it
time-consuming for us to provide clear instructions on how to gain
access to their database.

What if I install three blogs, each with a randomly generated prefix.
How will I know which one is the one I want to modify?

I've starting developing this system. It'll take no longer than a
couple of hours to finish from where I am at the moment, but sadly (?)
I'm about to go on a week's long holiday where I won't have access to
a computer. I'll finish developing when I get back. A copy of my tree
as it stands at the moment (based on revision 2658) can be found on my
server [1].

Storing just a unix timestamp and the offset means more parsing every
time dates need to be seen, instead of just once and throwing it into
the database.

Um, I don't know about you, but I don't display timestamps in DATETIME 
format -- they're ALWAYS transformed for display.  Storing in unix timestamp 
mode would actually remove an extra transform, as it like has to get 
transformed from mysql into epoch, then epoch into string, rather than 
direct epoch into string.

I'm all for moving to epoch stamps. ;)

Even with the stored date there is still more processing before the value
is used.  The time it takes to apply the time offset to the timestamp is
trivial comparatively, I would say.

So instead of:

	date($blog_date_format, $post_date)

you'd do:

	date($blog_date_format, $unix_timestamp_post_date + 
$gmt_offset_converted_to_seconds_difference)

Doesn't seem like a far strech to me.

Actually, instead of doing mysql2date($blog_date_format,
$post_date_gmt), you do date($blog_date_format, $post_date_gmt).
mysql2date() does a lot of string processing which is actually
relatively cheap, but if sqlite support is a plus side, I'd vote yes
for moving toward timestamp dates. I'm still for storing post_date and
post_date_gmt rather than post_date and post_timezone_offset, though;
it makes things simpler because you only have to add the offset once
(at INSERT time), rather than every time the page loads (SELECT time).

Why? Are they not using pretty urls?

I think they (ID's) should be completely removed from the UI because, 
unless you are using them in your urls, they are completely superfluous 
noise for users.

ID's are for geeks... anyone organizing their HD by inode?

Why not just store the UTC timestamp and set the TZ in the php 
environment? Timezones can be looked up and putinto a <select>, and 
involve no calculation on the users part.

// config blog
putenv('TZ='.get_settings('timezone'));

// get date
date($date_format,$post_date);

// store date
gmtdate($post_date);

How about if we store the prefix in the options table? Then it's only

Ahhh, okay, there are two completely different threads going on here.

One was about storing as unix timestamps instead of mysql DATETIME.  The 
other, apparently, was about storing the timezone offset at time of post 
rather than the gmt timestamp at time of post.

For the former, I'm all for it.  Go to timestamps, nix DATETIME, makes it 
easier for alternate DB systems.

For the latter, I can't say I care much either way.  A gmt offset is only 24 
values (okay, 48 if you want half-hours), which is under a single byte.  A 
timestamp is at least a 4-byte value.  I don't know that saving three bytes 
per post makes any difference versus the constant recalc time, so I'm 
probably with mr. house on this one.  SO, just store a gmt unix timestamp as 
well!  All done? ;)

I knew there was something too simple about my suggestion :)

For anyone that didn't catch was Mark Ghosh was saying, you'd need to
know the DB prefix in order to query the DB to find out what the DB
prefix is...

What if the user is locked out of their blog in some way?  How can they
select data about the database if they need that data to find their
database?

/me slaps forehead.
Even if the prefix is randomly generated, it still needs to be recorded
in wp-config.php.  So we can just tell people to read that file, and
find the prefix.

I stil vastly prefer allowing people to select their own prefix.
Perhaps, if this system gets rolled out, the installer can supply a
randomly generated prefix in text field, and the user can elect to keep
it or replace it, as they see fit.

The installer will then need to be updated to check whether it has write
permission on the WP root.  If not, an explanation needs to be given to
the user to make the directory writable.  The installer creates
wp-config.php, then asks the user to remove write permission on WP root.

The /wp-admin/ pages may want to check write permissions on all
directories EXCEPT /wp-content/, and complain if things are writable.

Some folks do use cruft-free URIs with post IDs.  Whether they want
shorter URIs, or they want to be different, or whatever; the fact is
it's something they can do now, so there'll be noise if we remove it.

I agree; but again, folks are doing it.

Even end users become vocal when you remove IDs, because they are no longer
able to easily identify bits information. Picture the exclude argument in
template functions.

Actually, now that you mention it I have seen a couple of sites where 
the id is integral to the design, but then these are the type of sites 
where managing id's outside of WP is probably not too difficult for the 
owner =)

I'd see no problem in creating a secondary table for 'non-final' type 
of info: drafts and previous edits of posts. The ability to roll a post 
back is requested quite often.

Q. How can you exclude certain posts from being displayed?
A. Find that post's ID and use that to filter the query.

How often does that occur, on a per-post basis though?  Usually it's
category IDs that get suppressed.

My understanding of this whole time discussion was that "we" want to be 
able to bounce around timezones without invalidating the timestamps of 
previous blog entries.  So each entry needs a self-sufficient time.

You can also specify pages to be excluded from wp_list_pages but their ids.

Most importantly, fine tuning your post/page slug is important for
search engine optimisation and for those of us who believe in the url
as command line!

No since the code already has to do something along the following when
displaying a date in the blog:

1) Fetch the timestamp from the database, returned as a string.

2) Parse the string to obtain a proper Unix timestamp. This is done by
   mysql2date() in function.php --- note how this is used twice by
   setup_postdata() in the same file, and by get_post_time() in
   template-functions-general.php.

   The mysql2date() function breaks the MySQL timestamp up into parts,
   uses mktime() to generate an Unix timestamp, then does
   internationalization (which involves four preg_replace() calls plus
   some more), and finally it uses date() to convert the Unix
   timestamp back to a string.

The default way to get the time seems to be a call to the_time(). This
will trigger a chain of function calls:

  the_time() -> get_the_time() -> get_post_time() -> mysql2date()

If the_time() is called without a format parameter, then the
bottommost call to mysql2date() will be given a format string of 'U'
asking for a --- surprise, surprise! --- Unix timestamp. This is then
converted into a string in get_the_time(), before being passed on to
the_time().

The more I look at this, the more I think it could be done more
cleanly by just sticking to Unix timestamps all the way through.

I have the feeling that I find such things every time I look at the
code. I think it would be nice with an release which focuses on the
design and code quality. And it would also be a good opportunity to
put some comments into it.

I understand the permalink argument.

But does a need actually exist to maintain timezone settings on a per 
post basis, or does a per blog basis provide enough granularity?

There's no point building something for a perceived need that doesn't 
exist.

Terrence Wood.

The timezone for a blog can change due to DST.  If post times change
back and forth with DST, their permalinks are not so permanent.  So, we
need to store UTC time plus a UTC offset for each post.

If you setenv then the DST is taken care of for you... no intervention 
required.

I live in New Zealand, if I do this:

putenv('TZ=Auckland/Pacific'));

then entries made during DST are NZDT, otherwise they are NZST. PHP 
works it out for me.

That is not at all reliable given that some servers have no time zone
database or only a very crippled one.  PHP works it out, except when it
can't.

Unfortunately there's not yet any Free Software I could have used as an
analogy. As for Firefox, the poster boy for usable Free Software, its
original manifesto <http://blakeross.com/firefox/README-1.1.html> is
perhaps relevant to those clamouring for wider WordPress commit access.
The core developers took care to minimize the communication channels in
which people could argue against their changes, so that they could get

Unfortunately, until WordPress is used by the vast majority of people
who would ever want a Weblog (which will probably never happen), *any*
improvement to it probably will result in an increase in forum activity.
Not just because of people confused about the transition, but also
because the increase in user base will outweigh the long-term decrease
in puzzlement. So I don't think it's tenable for minimizing forum
activity to be the goal of WordPress development.

And "Existing timestamp" is *wrong* when the post/page hasn't been
published yet. I'd rather see something like this:

    Date and time:
    (*) the date and time of publication
    ( ) [________________]

And when editing something already published:

    Date and time:
    (*) 2005-06-25 14:23 (original publication)
    ( ) [________________]

If you got really clever, JavaScript could be used to show extra help
immediately under the text field, such as "This past date means the item
will appear in your archives.", or "The item will not appear on your
site until this future time.".

Meanwhile, if you're trying to put the important stuff above the fold,
why is "Excerpt" above "Post"? How are you supposed to be able to
excerpt something you haven't written yet? :-) (I still think it should
be "Summary" rather than "Excerpt", but even then it would make more
sense underneath.)

I would add to this by saying we already have every single user editing

all the Codex docs, readme, etc. This seems the simplest way to pull it 
off, and keeps the user in control.

Really, no matter what you do to tableprefix, odds are it won't help.
All a hacker has to do at sight of an sql injection is create an error
in the sql, and you see the tableprefix.

I'm sorry if this is not the relevant place for this question, but
it's something I missed.
Does the existence of WPMU mean that WP will never (perhaps that's too
strong a word, read for the foreseeable future) support multiple
weblogs?

Assuming that the GMT offset is a integer number of hours or half hours is unfortunately not possible.  The are a few
countries/regions with x:45 or x:15 offsets and it is quite possible that a country could legislate towards a
completely different offset if they so wished so we probably need to store the number of minutes to be safe.

If we are going to improve the storage of GMT offset then we probably need to improve/implement proper support for DST
because we can't assume that we can rely on the underlying system - however implementing full DST support can become a
nightmare (We have recently looked into this for work and I can dig up some references next week if any one is
interested)

I've also looked into implementing DST support for projects in the
past and realized there is no sure fire way to do it across platforms
and the best bet is to rely on the user knowing their offset. Sure,
minutes should be added, but adding automatic detection of DST and
appropriate changes to DST would be more of a hassle then its worth.

I agree. By suggesting sticking to human engineering I was just trying 
to head off some grand scheme for auto-randomization when the security 
benefits are close to nil.

While it's true that they're seperate projects they are intertwined.
Think of WPMU as the way WP supports multiple blogs. I'm moving back 
from using Smarty templates to using WP templates so it should be very 
easy for someone to setup a blogging site for their 
family/friends/community/co-workers and copy over their old templates.
There's still lots to be done however just to get to that stage yet, but 
I'll post to this list from time to time asking for feedback and 
comments on ways of doing things.
I got virtual host support working yesterday so you can have 
http://blogname.example.com instead of http://example.com/blogname/ but 
it's yet to go into SVN until I can smooth out a few rough edges.

Subject: [wp-hackers] post processing weirdness
Message-ID: <42BD7696.3040803@skippy.net>

A user of my subscribe2 plugin has brought a weird situation to my 
attention.

My plugin sends notifications of new posts when you publish them, 
registering itself against the publish_post action.  Included in the 
update notification is the permalink of the post.

If a user goes to the Write screen, composes a post, and presses the 
"Publish" button, the permalink in the update notification correctly 
applies the rewrite code to generate cruft-free URIs.

If a user creates and saves a Draft post, then later goes back and 
publishes that draft post, the update notification sends out a crufty URI.

I have confirmed that this happens on my 1.5.1.2 test blog.

I noticed slightly similar weird behavior when working on my WP-Cron 
Future Pings plugin: the global cached post object reflects its state 
_before_ you publish, and not the final state _after_ you click 
"Publish".  To avoid this in WP-Cron Future Pings, I directly queries 
the database for the post ID, to ensure that I had the most up-to-date data.

But for my subscribe2 plugin, I won't be able to do that right (unless I 
want to duplicate the contents of the get_permalink() function).

This is the offending line in wp-includes/template-functions-links.php:
if ('' != $permalink && 'draft' != $post->post_status) {

What harm is there in generating a permalink for a draft post?

My _real_ question, though, is what is this?
    $post = & get_post($id);
Line 40 of wp-includes/template-functions-links.php.

I grepped for "get_post" and found several get_post_*(), and of course 
get_posts(); but no get_post().  Is this simply a typo, or am I missing 
something?

I suspect that the get_post() results in a no-op, leaving $post set to 
the global $post object, which is still marked as Draft, even though 
"Publish" has been set.

Is this analysis correct?

Follow-up to myself: I have edited template-functions-links.php, and 
replaced get_post() with get_posts().  The correct cruft-free permalink 
is now generated.  So I guess it _is_ a simple typo, for which I'll now 
file a bug.  =)

Multiple weblogs is such an ambiguous term now, especially with things 
like Scott's vhosts plugin. I think between MU and WP we can support most 
any use case people can think up.

I think this is the bug that has been plaguing WordPress and me for 
months.  You remember the bug whereby if you created a draft and then 
published, your pingbacks would be sent out with crufty ?p= URIs?  If 
you honestly fixed that bug, I owe you a beer.  I spent about 2 hours 
trying to fix that bug and failing.

True. I guess I was specifically meaning out-of-the-box ability to
have separate functioning weblogs. This isn't something I personally
think is necessary, as you say there are many ways to do it, but it's
a question that I've been asked a few times and I think that there
would be a benefit to having some kind of official line on it.

Hang on to that beverage.

I reported my findings to the guy who originally reported the problem to 
me.  He went a step further in his testing and investigation, and 
reported this:

I didn't experience the same problem with the number of queries, but all 
my permalinks _did_ break, reverting to the current date with no post 
title.  =(

So the problem is a little more subtle perhaps than I understood it to be.

If Plesk supports adding wildcard records to your dns, and Apache 
behaves as expected when you add a wildcard alias to it, then yes, of 
course. (I've never used Plesk so I can't say for sure. If it's just a 
packaging system then there's no reason why it can't do at least some of 
the configuration - if your dns is held remotely then that might have to 
be a manual step.)

I made the following change to wp-includes/template-functions-links.php, 
at line 40:
         if (0 == $id) {
                 global $post;
         } else {
                 $post = & get_posts($id);
         }

That fixed my permalinks; and I'm still not seeing an increase in queries.

It's a nice feature.  Flickr pretty much does the same thing through 
XMLRPC posts right now.  Blogger's interface is nice all around, and we 
could learn a lot from their design.  It's unfortunate the software is 
so pretty but so feature poor.

as being discussed at this forum post
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/37331
there seems to be a problem in the functioning of 'the_excerpt' & 'the_content' filters. The thing is that if there's no excerpt for a post, 'the_content' is used by 'the_excerpt' to create an excerpt. so far its ok, but the problem is that the excerpt created has the filters applied to it which were for 'the_content' & then the filters meant for 'the_excerpt' are applied. But if there are one or more filters that are same for 'the_content' & 'the_excerpt' (as in my plugin's case, ig:Syntax Hiliter), there comes the problem with the plugin not working correctly on the excerpt.


Proposed Solution:-
-----------------------
The logical way would be that 'the_content' filters are not applied to the excerpt generated by 'the_content' as at that time, 'the_content' is not the target entity but is merely acting as a conduit for 'the_excerpt' to generate an excerpt from the DB. So when 'the_content' & 'the_excerpt' are treated as seperate entities by allowing different filters on each, then why not allow it in the right way? else what's the use of having 'the_excerpt' filter when 'the_content' filter is gonna be applied to the excerpt??

The above worked on my test blog, which is pretty vanilla. But it broke 
horribly on my real blog.  I tracked it down to the "Permalinks 
Redirect" plugin (http://scott.yang.id.au/2005/05/permalink-redirect/), 
and finally did this in wp-includes/template-functions-links.php:
if (0 == $id) {
      global $post;
} else {
      $post = & get_posts($id);
      $post = $post[0];
}

That didn't work ... Every permalink ended up pointing to my most recent 
post.

So I went to look at get_posts().  Duh -- it accepts a query string 
formatted parameter!

So, are we in fact missing a get_post() function, which accepts the post 
ID of a post to fetch?

I like being able to post from multiple timezones when I travel, using
the local time.

Also, I'm moving from the USA to Finland, and I like the idea that my
permalinks are *not* changing when the server TZ changes.

Ummm.  Guess that's one way, but maybe there needs to be yet-another filter, the_excerpt_content, or something like that, for the generated exerpt.  Also, realize that some folks like me write plugins that use the "get_zzzz" versions of things, so if you are hooking the_excerpt but not get_the_excerpt, the plugin won't necessarily get a properly-processed excerpt (although in this case, it's probably the correct result... highlighting shouldn't affect 'more direct' retrieval, just the 'generic page output tags'.

get_post() is in functions.php and accepts either a post ID or a
reference to an existing post object.

I've had several issues on my server with strings such as SELECT, and
<script>. Best I know is it comes from security features on the server, and
the following fix worked for me: submit the data using the POST method
rather than then GET method. Makes sense too.

well, another filter like you propose 'the_excerpt_content' won't work as the filter is still being applied to 'the_content' for the post pages & the main page. so that filter will be applied to that 'the_excerpt_content'. the solution is what I suggested, that either 'the_excerpt' shouldn't have any other filters applied except its own or there needs to be another excerpt generation function to whom only its own filters are applied & not that of anyone else.

frankly, what I fail to understand is why do we need to have the filters of 'the_content' applied to 'the_excerpt'?? I mean what use does it serve?? if there's a post excerpt specified, then 'the_content' filters won't be applied to it & if there's not, then both 'the_content' & 'the_excerpt' filters will be applied(some of which will be same). so it won't return the same output in both situations(in case there's excerpt & in case there is no excerpt), which it should(formatting wise)!!

Ummm.  Guess that's one way, but maybe there needs to be yet-another filter, the_excerpt_content, or something like that, for the generated exerpt.  Also, realize that some folks like me write plugins that use the "get_zzzz" versions of things, so if you are hooking the_excerpt but not get_the_excerpt, the plugin won't necessarily get a properly-processed excerpt (although in this case, it's probably the correct result... highlighting shouldn't affect 'more direct' retrieval, just the 'generic page output tags'.

Not sure if it's appropriate to bring up this old thread or if I 
should've started a new one, but FYI, parsing 
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/staticize-reloaded/trunk/readme.txt is a 
pain... it's markdown-ish, but the headings are mediawiki-type, but even 
for the mediawiki parser the headings are 'inverted', eg.:

=== Staticize Reloaded ===
== Installation ==
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Should be

= Staticize Reloaded =
== Installation ==

etc.

I'm off to make a function to 'reverse' those that heading format and 
put the result in markdown and then parse the whole readme through 
markdown, but just a heads up. It would be nice to declare what format 
exactly this file is to be in so plugin authors know what text filtering 
suite they can use syntax from, preferably Markdown.

The documentation team of volunteers is eagerly reading the hackers and 
testers mailing lists, trying to distill what we need to know in order 
to prepare documents for the next releases, all the way to 1.6. Rumors 
are flying that there will be a new documentation site to handle 1.6. 
New volunteers are now backing out because they do not want their 
efforts to go to waste. So help us clear up some of the rumors, please.

We understand that the development team is working hard to improve the 
interface, the Administration Panels, of WordPress. Our concerns address 
other issues:

1. Will all the current template tags be replaced in the new version(s)? 
Or just expanded and added to?

2. Will Themes, as they are currently structured, continue to work? Or 
need dramatic alterations such as with 1.2 to 1.5?

3. Will Loop structures need to be changed or will they continue to 
function?

4. Will current plugins still work?

5. Will Pages be changed or improved? Will there be another additional 
feature like Pages added to allow the user to work outside of the Loop?

6. WordPress Average User asks, "How much WORK will I have to do to 
upgrade my WordPress site?"

Thank you,

Some filters (like Markdown) must be processed before the 
`wp_trim_excerpt` function strips HTML tags. Otherwise, some Markdown 
syntax constructs looking like tags get stripped before Markdown has a 
chance to transform them to proper HTML.

That said, other filters need to do their work after trimming. So here 
is what could be done:

Let's say there is a new `get_the_content` filter hook that filter post 
content prior passing it to `the_content`. The `wp_trim_excerpt` 
function could pass the content through `get_the_content` instead of 
`the_content`. Filters could then decide if they must apply before or 
after trimming the excerpt (with `get_the_*` or with `the_*`).

Speaking of my vhost plugin, I took a first stab at filtering 
wp_list_pages() to return only the list of pages owned by the user 
assigned to the vhost.

I looked at filtering wp_list_cats() to do the same (that is, only 
return the children categories of the vhost category) but got a little 
overwhelmed.  If anyone wants to take a stab at that, I'll be your best 
friend!

Long-term, it's clear to me that vhost won't be a super robust multiple 
blog solution.  That's not to say that vhost is solely a novelty (I'm 
using it for one site, and enjoying it); but too much of WordPress lacks 
fine-grained controls.  For example, Link categories don't have 
"owners", nor do they support sub-categories.  So either the vhost user 
will be restricted to a single Link category, or Link categories are a 
free-for-all based solely on user level.

Same for categories: categories don't have owners, only parent and 
children categories.  As above, it'd be great to filter wp_list_cats() 
to display only the categories under the vhost cat; but I'll still need 
to filter Admin->Manage->Categories to ensure that the vhost user only 
sees their own categories for administration.

Finally, the permission system needs to be juggled.  vhost users ought 
to be able to use the Template Editor, so that they never need to deal 
directly with the filesystem, but the permission level necessary to do 
that is a little higher than is acceptable for a mass-hosting 
environment as might use vhost.

And don't get me started on plugins...  =)

Of course, if you're using vhost only to support easy (or easier) 
templating on sub-domains for yourself, all of the above is irrelevant.

I'd _like_ to get vhost to a point where it can power a (reasonably) 
functional WordPress blog for multiple users without those users 
stomping on each other's work.

Patches are welcome!  vhost is GPL licensed, so if any of it can benefit 
WPMU, feel free to use it.

Cheers,
Scott

All current tags will be carried forward.

No.  Alterations weren't required in 1.5 either.  They were needed only
if you wanted to use the theme features.

No.  All loop structures ever supported by WP are still supported today
and will be supported in 1.6.

> 4. Will current plugins still work?

Yes, although there are usually some that break from release to release.
Some plugins did deep into WP internals, which may change.  Some plugins
rely on buggy WP behavior to do their work and break when the WP bug is
fixed.  So, there will likely be some breakage, but nothing systemic.

I suspect there will be improvements.   Improvements are good, right?

Download files, upgrade.php.

The 1.5 theme changes were an exceptional event.  However, those changes
were completely optional.  1.2 templates copied into 1.5 work just fine,
you just can't use themes unless you upgrade your templates.

1.5 and 1.6 are going to have some notable differences (otherwise it
would be called 1.5.2).  The documentation team needs to decide how they
are going to support both 1.5 and 1.6.  Most documentation will apply to
both, but there will be some divergence as features are added to 1.6.

I suggest that all docs be placed at one place & each feature/hook/function etc. be tagged 
with the version in which its supported, like the PHP Manual, which has all the functions etc. but 
right below function names it has the PHP versions for which they're available.

The only problem with this suggestion is that we'll either have to
wait until 1.6 is out to start documentation or we'll have to start it
now, which is another blow to the effort to keep normal users away
since its documented ahead of time. For now, maybe 1.6 docs can be
thrown onto discussion pages, and then about a week before release
have all the codex volunteers merge the documentation like what Amit
suggested.

A few thoughts:

Drafts should not have permalinks.  First, they're drafts, so there's 
nothing "perma" about them, just on a conceptual level.  Second, unless 
you manually specify a slug, the slug is not created until you publish 
the post, and can (and should) be changed by the user.

What should happen, though, is that the permalink is created before the 
publish_post action goes out.  This is not always the case, and that's a 
bug.

Hi folks,

The WP openness thread last week lead me to think about the question
"what can non-developers do to influence the dev process?"  It seems to
me the answer is "don't just write emails, write specs".   It's a way
that productive activity can happen without up-front involvement from
the core developers.  Of course, the core devs eventually have to get
involved, but hopefully, only if they want to and/or if the
specification has been properly vetted.

So, I tried documenting both how to create a good spec, and how to
publish it on codex (with much help from Lorelle).  Here's the doc:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Development_Planning

Please take a look at it, and feel free to add links to other specs.
The initial list is by no means complete or even an attempt at
completeness, but rather a starting point.

Thanks
Rob

Subject: [wp-hackers] url_to_postid() improvements
Message-ID: <42BFDCFC.5000500@txfx.net>

As many people have noticed, url_to_postid() fails in many cases.  It 
creates false positives (suggesting a post ID for URIs that are not 
posts) and false negatives (failing on legit post URIs).

I spent some time identifying the cases that fail and patching the 
url_to_postid() function to handle them.

Some significant changes have been made in 1.6 SVN to the 
url_to_postid() function, but it still fails in many cases.  I also 
patched in my changes to that version of the function, but still, it 
fails many tests.

I've set up a page for testing of the 4 functions (1.5.1.2 version, 
1.5.1.2 patched by me, 1.6 SVN version, and 1.6 SVN patched by me).

http://txfx.net/wordpress/url-to-postid.php

You can enter in URIs to test, but I've put down 6 examples of common 
URIs that fail.  See the results for yourself at the link above, but 
here's the summary:

1. http://txfx.net/code/?foo=bar is a valid link to a page but with some 
junk thrown at the end.  Both patched versions get this right.
2. http://txfx.net/code/#random-anchor is a valid link to a page but 
with a junk anchor at the end.  Both patched versions get this right.
3. http://txfx.net/page/23 is a link to the 23rd page of the front-page 
view, not a post.  It should return 0.  Only my patched 1.5.1.2 version 
gets this right.
4. http://www.txfx.net/code/ is a valid link to a page, but with "www." 
inserted.  Only my patched 1.5.1.2 version gets this right.
5. http://txfx.net/2005/02/16/ is a link to a day view, not a post.  It 
should return 0.  Only my patched 1.5.1.2 version gets this right.
6. http://txfx.net/category/internet/ is a link to a category.  It 
should return 0.  Only my patched 1.5.1.2 version gets this right.

The patched version of the 1.5.1.2 version of the function is the only 
one to get them all right.  Included is the PHP file I used for 
testing.  Inside are my patched versions, my_url_to_postid() (the 
1.5.1.2 patched version) and my_wp16_url_to_postid() (1.6 SVN patched 
version).

I don't know if the 1.6 version can be modified to handle all 6 cases, 
and if not, it might be best to use my patched version of the 1.5.1.2 
function.

I'd appreciate feedback on this, especially from Ryan Boren, who checked 
in the changes for 1.6

Hmm, url_to_post_id() in 1.5.1.2 and 1.6 should be the same. Regardless, I
gave a quick glance at your 1.6 changes and they look goood.  I look over
them more when I get home tonight.  Something that might help eliminate
false positives is changing this:

if ( !empty($query->post) )

to something like this:

if ( $query->is_single || $query->is_page )

Try integrating that into your 1.6 version of url_to_postid() if you think
it would be helpful.  Also, I think some comments explaining the string
manipulations might be usful.  The intent of our query whacking can be
hard to decipher at times.

Yes!  That is exactly what I needed.

I used that, plus code to clean up "www." when it shouldn't be there or 
add "www." when it should as well as strip "index.php/" when it 
shouldn't be there (path info URIs work if you're using mod_rewrite, but 
url_to_postid() used to choke on them).  Now the patched 1.6-SVN 
function can handle anything I throw at it.

For instance, check it handle this bad boy:
http://txfx.net/wordpress/url-to-postid.php?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.txfx.net%2Findex.php%2Fcode%3Ffoo%3Dbar%23random-anchor

Agreed!  I commented quite liberally.

Hi All,

Just a short message in case no-one reads my blog!

Following on from the seemingly large number of people hit by the vulnerability  in 1.5.1.1 and earlier even now a
month after the update was released I have put together an XML-RPC webservice (using IXR) and a corresponding plugin
that checks to see if $wp_version is up to date or not

Announcement url: http://www.ftwr.co.uk/blog/archives/2005/06/27/wordpress-version-check/

All comments suggestions etc. gratefully received.

This is possibly something that would be nice to have in core wordpress as an easy heads up way of getting a message
to the end-users.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Pre-run `the_content` filters
Message-ID: <42C07ED3.7070101@txfx.net>

I'd like to propose that the dormant `post_content_filtered` post be put 
to use in the WordPress core for 1.6.  There are plugins to harness it, 
but they are complicated, buggy, and unreliable, due to the complex 
nature of the path that entry content follows as it is processed.

Here is what I propose:

The 'the_content' filter should be run as usual, for backwards compat.  
This will be the "live" filter.  An additional filter, 
'the_content_prefiltered' or some such thing should be run on post 
save/publish/edit or created on the fly if it the 
`post_content_filtered` column is empty.  All existing 'the_content' 
filters in WordPress would be moved to this filter, as stuff like auto 
paragraphs and curly quotes can be done ahead of time.

With default WordPress setup, this won't speed things up that much.  But 
things like Markdown or Textile2 would benefit immensely, were they to 
use the "prefiltered" hook.  I had to disable the acronym plugin because 
it was slowing things down too much.  Going through an array of 100-200 
acronyms and running 100-200 regexes on each post is really a drag.  
There is no need to do this every time a post is displayed!  Filters 
that need to be run live can still do so, by staying hooked to "the_content"

This would be backwards compatible, with benefits increasing as plugin 
authors upgraded their plugins.

TextPattern does this, storing a Textile2 processed version of the post 
in the DB.  Storage is much cheaper than processing.  Most post tables 
are only a few MB anyway.

The bottom line is this: you can do some amazing stuff with the 
'the_content' filter, but you are limited in that it has to be done on 
the fly.  I think this would be a great way to make 1.6 faster that 
1.5.1.2... always a perk.

Can anyone think of any reason why we shouldn't do this?

I agree.  There's some funny logic in get_permalinks, which is the
cause of crufty URLs on posts which were originally saved as drafts.

This appears to be simply a problem with the 'editpost' branch in
wp-admin/post.php, which is missing the appropriate SQL.

Patch against 1.5.1.2 (sorry, I'm not brave enough to run current SVN)
at:

http://dev.webadmin.ufl.edu/~dwc/tmp/permalinks-1.5.1.2.patch

I'm not going to claim that's the "best" way to accomplish things, but
it works in my tests.

No.  Looks good to me.  Shall we resurrect the per-post-filters

Alright, let's stick that mediawiki link and other links mentioned in
these user permissions threads in a "Prior Art" section on the page you
already started.

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:RobLa/Access_Control_Development

Additional prior art comes from TextDrive.

I think the only way is to have the DB optimized, then save single
table making them zipped or gzipped. Very very large DB will need a
backup procedure like the backup plugin and then the use of FTP for
the download. I can't see any other solution :(

Upload the file via ftp then put in a support ticket with your host and 
have them do the sql import via command line. You can also do this 
yourself if you have shell access on your server. That way you won't be 
limited to the ~60-120 second time out that most hosts limit you to.

Thank Ryan and Stefano - I'll try and put together something for users. 
This is by far the commonest reason I am emailed so both your

Hi all,

There is a fairly good article from the phpBB knowledge base about
importing/exporting large mysql databases that may have relevance
here:
http://www.phpbb.com/kb/article.php?article_id=9

Another idea for importing the large SQL file is to use PHP to parse
the SQL and execute all of the queries. One could use a script such as
sql_parse.php (http://www.koders.com/php/fid057F4651B68A06830A77AE58CC2A8CA0443E0984.aspx)
to extract all of the queries from an sql file.

This thread:
  http://wordpress.org/support/topic/37482
was last responded to by Ryan on Saturday.  Since then, some development
work has occured on WordPress in the form of SVN check-ins for Mark
Jaquith's get_id_by_permalink() work.

So, is there a confirmed vulnerability about which we should be
concerned?  If so:
* are there any mitigating circumstances to lessen the threat?
* are there any steps we can take to protect ourselves until an official
update is released?

I'm not trying to be a gadfly; and I'm not trying to rush anything
along.  But I _would_ want to see that thread marked "resolved", so that
regular folks don't worry that 'nothing happens' with regard to
WordPress security.

If we revealed that, we would be telling everyone where to look.

Hopefully we will be able to release the fix and 1.5.1.3 soon.

While on the subject, did that cover both security related checkins,
or did you discover the XSS on your own?

One was discovered on our own.  The reporter on the forums had also
discovered this one as well as two others we did not know about.  The
big one hasn't been committed yet.  I don't want that commit lurking in
plain sight until we are ready to release.  I'll probably be hitting up
some trusted folks for help with testing.

To be fair to Ryan, he just committed the patch that I had sent to the 
list without doing any work on it himself.  So it's not like he's 
spending time on other stuff when there's a security exploit still 
unpatched in 1.5.1.2  Applying the patch and committing it probably took 
all of 15 seconds.

And to Ryan/Matt, if you would like another set of eyes to review code 
for that exploit, I'll be available today and tomorrow.

We went ahead and commited for 1.5 and 1.6.  Please review and test.

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2667

The problem is with XMLRPC args not being escaped because they come in
through raw post data, thus avoiding magic quoting.

If you want to try it out, you can svn update from the 1.5 branch or
download the two updated files.  Just drop them on top of 1.5.1.2.

When I backported this from 1.6 I left some 1.6-isms in. Use this new
version of xmlrpc.php.

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2670
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2670

Please test the hell out of XMLRPC.  Post, edit, etc. from your favorite
client and make sure I didn't break anything.  Test some incoming pings
too.

Will this fix be put on the 1.5 branch in SVN too?

I used to track SVN from the trunk, but after work began on 1.6 I
haven't updated my checkout.  So I guess I should do a 'svn switch' to
the 1.5 branch instead of using the trunk, but this will only make
sense if stuff is actually back-ported to 1.5.

now

I followed the upgrade instructions at the codex when I upgraded to
WordPress 1.5.1.3, DON'T DO THAT 

The kit (zip) is missing a lot of files like wp-admin/install.php and
wp-admin/upgrade.php.

I seams like it's a copy-and-overwrite upgrade, but I'd wait until it's
confirmed by Matt & Co

Only 3 or 4 files were changed, and no database changes were made, so
upgrade.php and the like are not needed. This probably should be fixed
though, for new users to be able to install.

Looking at the latest.zip & latest.tar.gz currently returned by wp.org those files are there.

Message-ID: <42C2A211.8090707@coldforged.org>

Matt/Ryan,

Could we get an SVN tag on the 1.5.1.3 release files? Is there a reason 
that this isn't part of the standard process in performing releases?

    Thanks!

There is no reason for a tag unless there is something newer, just use
the 1.5 branch.

Been working with this for about an hour,I've traced it down to
$dateCreatedd not being an instance of IXR_Date, although I can't
manage to trace it back to where the problem is originating or what in
the patch broke it.

A tag is just a "snapshot" of a project in time. It gives a more
logical name than revision 2672 for when you want to refer to it (for
example for diffs or change logs).

You can then subsequently turn a tag into a branch if you wish to make
changes to that snapshot.

Before I forget, hat tip to skippy for tracing down the line that was
causing the problem, but the obvious solution of doing $this->escape
on every $arg but $arg[3] didn't work, but $wpdb->escape does and
achieves the same purpose. I haven't had time to look into why
$this->escape doesn't work, in fact, I have not a damn clue what it
is.

Seems like instead of this patch, the function in wp-db.php could be fixed:

function escape($str) {
	if(is_array($str)) return array_map('addslashes', $str);
	return addslashes($str);				
}

Not escaping the content_struct will result in breakage with content
that contains quotes.  A better solution might be to have the xmlrpc
escape() method not escape objects.

Well, it's setup to always take an array because it is intended to be
used on the entire $args array, not individual elements.

I admit to being a little out of my league with regards to the specifics
of XMLRPC; but does this patch (not escaping objects) re-open the XMLRPC
vulnerability that 1.5.1.3 was intended to fix?

It shouldn't, because only the object with the IXN_Date class isn't
being escaped, although this could potentially open another
vunerability if the date is not escaped properly, does mysql2date()
have anything to prevent this?

No.  There are only a couple of objects involved, most everything is a
string.  The object causing the problem here is IXR_Date.  IXR_Date
slices and dices the incoming date string and makes it safe for use.
So, it's contents don't need to be escaped.

While we're at it, could the following fix be added in 1.5.1.4?

In function get_post_meta(), add the following line at the beginning:

if ($post_id) return;

Else, you tend to end up with random default meta when creating new posts.

I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong --- I did check the repository
before posting, and at the time of my post (Jun 28 20:00:26 2005 UTC)
the update to the 1.5 branch had not yet taken place: changeset 2667
was made two hours later.

And to add something usefull to this post as well: I  updated my site
using 'svn merge':

  svn merge -r 2661:2672 \
  http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/1.5/

That applied the changes made to the 1.5 branch to my checked out copy
of the trunk. So I now have a fairly inconsistant copy (it thinks it's
tracking the trunk, but it contains 'local modifications' based on the
changes on the branch) but at least I have the security patch.

The reason is book-keeping: having a symbolic name (a tag) is much
easier to refer to than a revision number, especially some weeks or
months later if someone needs to branch.

I disagree.  You should always tag when there is some sort of release, so 
there's never a question of what that release was in files and time.  And 
tags in SVN are near-zero overhead (they just point to the revision number 
if I recall a year ago!).  Go tag happy! ;)  It also has the secondary 
advantage of being able to look at the tags as a history/status of its own, 
rather than looking at individual branches and checkins...

Just IMHO. ;)

There is no reason for a tag unless there is something newer, just use
the 1.5 branch.

You could just have done

  > svn sw http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/1.5/

which would have moved you over (switch'ed) to the 1.5 branch (with the 
security fix) *and* updated it. (All in one command! How awesome is SVN.)

You'll be able to move back to the trunk whenever you'd like, up in the 
mean time you'll be able to do "> svn up" should 1.5.1.4 come out. 
Pretty slick.

I'll tag when I get home.  Right now I'm stuck in a meeting.

"Do we support section blah.blah.blah of the OMG spec?  The customer
demands that we support section blah.blah.blah."

"Does the customer even know what section blah.blah.blah means?"

"No, but they think it sounds cool and they want it."

Anyway, for the moment 1.5.1.3 is known as repository revision 2672.

This has happened before - empty files, 1K downloads, no downloads and

Shouldn't bother fixing 1.5.1.3, we need 1.5.1.4 soon anyways

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress 1.5.1.3 SVN tag please?

My point was that tagging isn't really needed if there are to be no
more changes in the branch, which I thought would be the case at the
time of 1.5.1.3

If there is a problem, it could easily be with the method rather than  
with this particular instance.  Supposing that is the case, "fixing  
1.5.1.3" would fix all future redirects as well.  But I agree, there  
are likely more important things going on at the moment.

This post:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/37788#post-213513
links to this ticket:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1355
which should probably be reviewed before an official update to 1.5.1.3
gets committed.

Too late.  That's been a bug for awhile; we'll have to live with it a
little longer.  Most of the patches I've seen floating around (such as
the one in 1355) will cause a more profound breakage in certain clients.
I'm tidying this area up for 1.6.

Hi,
I've been working on a Gallery Manager (photoblogging) plugin for a few
months now and I'd really appreciate it if anybody could have a look at it
and tell me what they think:

http://blogs.hiveworks.com/msa/downloads/gallery-manager/

It's still in beta, because it hasn't been properly tested yet, at least
not enough.

The plugin works with page templates to add gallery pages to WordPress and
custom tags to add pictures to posts. I have written a very simple theme
API to help people integrate the pages into their theme, which I intend to
expand in the future.

I haven't had time to document the API or the plugin, but I know that has
to happen so I'll do it ASAP.

Please let me know what you think, all comments and suggestions are welcome.

Kind regards,

Michail Sarigiannidis

Anyone have a client that uploads images?  I think I see a problem in
mw_newMediaObject().  $data['bits'] has been escaped which will probably
result in a screwed up file.  Nothing in the $data array looks like it
needs to be escaped; none of it goes to the DB.  Here's a possible fix.

An attachment would help.  Please try the existing code to verify that
it breaks and then try the patch.

Since I have to fix the image thing anyway, I'll try to get this in.
Patch attached that will hopefully work for everyone.  I also attached a
full copy of xmlrpc.php for drop in convenience.  I need feedback quick.

This also includes the image upload fix (already committed).  Please try
it out if your uploaded images were being corrupted.

Cross posted to the testers list.

I went ahead and committed it so that it would be easier to get at.  I
still need feedback.

I totally disagree with you, this would break almost everything we've done so 
far in that way.

1.5.1.3 seems to have introduced a bug. All my posts are set to reject
pingbacks. Yet, I've received two last night.

Am I the only one in this case?

If you upgrade xmlrpc.php and not functions-post.php you will get extra
slashes.

Any feedback?  I need feedback from ecto users, especially.  The forums
report problems uploading images via ecto with the updated version even

I get the same error as Peter. I was using an old version of ecto
(Mac), so I upgraded thinking it would change things. It didn't.

Excellent.  That's what I needed.

This version of functions-post.php "should" fix ecto.  Give it a twirl.

Why not just put a hard link to the actual file?

Indeed, ethereal is very useful.

I borrowed a windows laptop and tried to install ecto, but it complained
about .NET being too old.  If you or someone else can capture a session
where ecto is used to write a new post, that would be helpful in
tracking down why some ecto users are getting the extra default
category.  I think everything else is resolved.

Thanks for the help.
