I use Event Organiser plugin by Stephen Harris, which I have found very 
good - and it works up to WP 3.7.1
http://wordpress.org/plugins/event-organiser/
The PRO version has many more features, but the free version is 
excellent for Calendar and Events.

I use event calendar and it manages to conform to all the nuances I've got
working - they have great support if you have a specific need.

A fast update on this topic. I used the approach you guys suggested (thank
you) and it worked flawlessly.
Just a side note on the implementation. I had to use a utility function to
create classes instances like this:

// Use this function to instantiate classes inside themes
function my_theme_instance($class){
    // Check if we are inside child theme and action has not been called.
This means that we are trying to instantiate parent theme
    if(is_child_theme() && did_action("after_setup_theme") === 0){
        return false;
    }
    elseif(class_exists($class)){
        return new $class;
    }
}
Hope this helps.

Cheers

Subject: [wp-hackers] Different background colors for different code blocks
 to help keep organized code
Message-ID: <1386006246964-42978.post@n5.nabble.com>

I am looking for a way to keep my php code organized, and it occurred to me
that an opaque background color on different blocks of code would be the
easiest way to easily identify which block I am searching for.  I use
dreamweaver right now, and sometimes a program called brackets.  Neither
support a MS Word "highlight" style for different code blocks.   Does anyone
have any suggestions or recommendations on how I could go about this.  

I did search all the plugin directories as well, and it looks like as far as
I can tell, this does not exist.  It would be a massive help to keep my code
organized - and I realize this is not wordpress specific, but some of the
brightest programmers are on this mailing list, so if this plugin exists (or
if I am to receive good advice for keeping code blocks organized and easily
identifiable) this is the place to discover it.

I'd suggest switching to a more powerful IDE that can help you do those
sort of things automatically.  I used Aptana for a while and am currently
using phpstorm and love it.  Both would be a major upgrade over dreamweaver.

Already happy I asked here, thank you for the suggestion.  Giving the demo

coding applications?

  I've been using Netbeans for a few years now and while it's got its 
quirks, it's very powerful and integrates very nicely with Github. There 
are a good amount of plugins to extend it and it's not hard to write 
them yourself if there's something in particular you want it to do or do 
differently. Plus, it's open source.

That's more for heavy code stuff -- writing plugins, etc. For general 
site design / theme modification Notepad++ also has a ton of great 
features, is also open source and has a ton of plugins.

I personally use Sublime Text(just switched to 3, but 2 is great as well) -
it runs on an unlimited evaluation copy - the only thing that comes from
the free version is that you see a pop-up every now and then that asks you
to buy a license(which I eventually will).
What I like about Sublime Text is that it's very fast and very
light-weight. I've seen a co-worker use Netbeans and it was veeeery slow(it
could have been his configuration as well of course).
Sublime Text also has a rather easy way of creating snippets - a snippet is
basically a piece of XML code.
You can install, remove, activate and deactivate plugins without restarting
the whole thing.

Anyway though - sorry for the offtopic(since I don't think what Greg was
looking for is possible in ST) :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress CRUD?
Message-ID: <CAEamYWTVsFDqGHB5dszPYoBrcy8Oy_qWPSO7J1cnvXNkY2gXKg@mail.gmail.com>

Just wondering, because it's come up a few times with clients, whether
there has ever been any discussion of expanding and enhancing the Roles and
Capabilities system into more of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete)
style ACL API?

With corporate clients, it often happens that they want to give a user the
ability to edit posts, but not to create them. This is especially important
when we get into CPTs that are business logic driven.

One thing to keep in mind is that IDEs like PHPStorm/NetBeans/Aptana are
all super-powerful, but it's very easy to fail to take advantage of that
power. They've all got hundreds of features, some of which you need to
ignore (to maintain your sanity) and others that you need to seek out to
take advantage of.

In terms of your original question I think you're probably on the wrong
track looking for "highlighting" of code blocks. Instead you should make
sure that you're making full use of the following features in whatever IDE
you choose:

   - "Go to declaration" which will let you select a function/method and
   jump to it's definition.
   - "Find usages" which will search out all uses of a
   function/method/variable.
   - "Code folding" which will let you collapse sections of a document so
   that the parts you're working on are closer together. (NetBeans and
   probably others also have a "Collapse All/Expand All" feature that folds
   the entire document, a great way to get a bird's-eye view of your code.

FWIW making your code easy to navigate isn't just about tools, sometimes
you also need to re-organize your code to make it easier to work with. If
most of your code is contained in monolithic functions that handle input,
query the DB and output HTML then the "Go to declaration" feature of an IDE
will still take you to an unmanageable mess. Having your program logic
broken up into small, focused bits of code will make it easier to find what
you need whether you're using the scroll wheel, a basic search tool or a
full suite of IDE tools.

I did a WordCamp talk about using IDEs (NetBeans as example) a couple years
ago, might be worth checking out:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWllWP3NKM


P.S. On choosing an IDE: I've used NetBeans for a long time and find it
extremely useful, but it's been buggier than usual lately, especially the
latest release (7.4). Performance-wise it's been shockingly up-and-down
over the years, usually bouncing back from the points where it got really
laggy. That said I usually have it running on a fairly-powerful MacBook, so
if you've got a budget rig you'll probably have a different experience.
PHPStorm seems like the obvious choice as a commercial alternative, I would
switch if I wasn't so comfortable with my NetBeans setup.

I?ve found Netbeans on Mavericks to be a beachball party (https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=237301).

Hi,

Just wondering.... has anyone else received an unsolicited 'password 
reset' email from wordpress.org today?

I received one, and wondered if it's part of a pattern. Obviously a 
wordpress.org login is quite powerful if it control SVN access to a 
top-100 plugin installed on 50,000 sites, and there are presumably bad 
guys who try to crack them.

Do you have a username that some user is likely to think is their own?

You'd be surprised at the number of people trying to log into WordPress.org
using their usernames/passwords from their own websites. Then getting
confused as to why they never get the reset email...

Message-ID: <CAOwx47cGVF8K7V+AoA4cFW4W0xUEU_4c3OXqgcOeaMV3WC9Y7Q@mail.gmail.com>

It just occurred to me - the new feature(automatic download/update of
translation files) that is planned for WordPress is awesome, but would it
overwrite any changes the user might have done to the local translation
file?

For instance, the user has installed the Codestyling Localization plugin,
or has a different way of overwriting translation files and has modified
one or more translation files.

Why would they do that? Well they just don't like the wording for instance
- translation files are a great way to tweak texts(even when the original
text is in the same language), without having to modify the code.

So what I'm wondering is - are those edits going to be lost upon update or
are they going to be preserved? It's true that if it's the translation file
of a theme or a plugin that they changed, upon updating those the edits
would be lost, but does the same apply for WordPress translation
files(stored in /wp-content/languages/)?

If the files are being stored in a place that WordPress is expecting to be
able to update them, then yes. It's no different than changing core code or
changing code in a plugin or theme directly.

If you use customized files, then you should put them in custom locations
with some form of custom code to cause the system to use them. Modifying
files that can be updated by an auto-update process directly means your
changes are not safe.

Okay, so do you know if it's possible to have "overriding" of translations
that would work like extending a class in PHP. So - you would have your
custom translation file that will only overwrite a couple of the
translation strings. Everything else would come from the original
translation file.

Also are you aware of any plugins that can do that at the moment? Or is
that even possible filter-wise.

You would have to manually create merge product. You may use msgmerge[1] 
or similar command to accomplish this. I am not sure if there is some 
PHP implementation of this.

Translation files themselves are not meant to be extended, unlike 
classes in object oriented programming.

It may be worth checking out what our POMO class allows though, you may
find it's possible for it to load multiple files into the same text domain
(or at least, it might be easy to allow that to happen).

WordPress by default only loads one file per language + text domain though.

WordPress will [eventually] automatically update any language files in
WP_LANG_DIR/(plugins|themes)/$plugin-$lang.(mo|po), so if you store your
custom files in WP_LANG_DIR/custom-plugins/, or
WP_PLUGIN_DIR/plugin-slug/my-translations/$plugin-$lang.(mo|po) you'll be
fine.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Questions regarding extending WP_Post
Message-ID: <CA+-Vqo_zH-Qa8Qt6Y0oYNj7Cxdy4d9_i+B+9bxP-UHYjvkWACg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, WP Hackers!  I have a few questions on the implementation of the
WP_Post class that WordPress uses.  I was wondering if there was a
technical reason why WP_Post is declared final?  I was doing some research
on ways to extend it and I found it strange that its declared final, making
it impossible to extend the class other than to copy, paste and editing the
code.  Was there a particular reason or was it just the coder's preference?

Second question is about posts and the filtered template functions like
the_title, the_content, etc.  Is there any reason why these functions
weren't included as methods of the WP_Post class?  To me it makes sense and
would allow coders to not rely on the global variables and functions in
secondary loops.  Instead of using the global variables via the_post or
using setup_postdata and having to call wp_reset_postdata afterwards to
clean everything up, you could call the methods os the WP_Post class.

See the original implementation ticket:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21309

In short: It's declared final to prevent people extending it as there
wasn't a full thought on how it should be utilised, so extending it was
disabled so as not to break back-compat when it's modified later.

As for why it doesn't have any methods for common things yet, that's also
due to the implementation not being final.

It makes so much sense to me to let developers extend this.  Perfect use
case: You create a post type that has custom meta that's common among posts
of that type.  Instead of calling get_post_meta, you extend the WP_Post
class and add a function that formats and returns that meta.  I wanted to
extend the class for that very use case.

In specific reference to these, yes, they are spam and fake.

I believe that Gmail and Yahoo are now actively marking them as spam, from
reports of smart users of those services. I've not received the emails
myself, but I've had a few forwards sent to me.

WordPress.org doesn't do that sort of thing. Obviously. Please pass it
along that these are fake and the links contain malware. Also pass along
basic malware-sniffing-smartness, if possible. Better for the world in
general, sort of thing.

Wouldn't just something like:

add_filter( 'auto_update_translation', '__return_false' );

do the trick of avoiding auto-update on translations?

I mean, you do normally know when you're using custom translations, and 
adding this filter is trivial (it's custom code that looks easier than 
using custom loading code, and user-unfriendly custom locations).

Maybe the only issue is *when* should it be added, but so far it worked 
for me hooking it at init.


Cheers

Xavier

That is also an option, but when I have some free time on my hands some day
I might look into the more complicated way.
Simply because if you don't get any updates on your custom translation
files, then you would have missing translations as well - and merging the
default with your custom translations manually would eventually get time
consuming.

Well, this only disables *automatic* translations. You can always check 
them manually from the update panel, AFAIK. (May be wrong in this). 
Meaning that you can manually update the non-custom files in the good 
ol' way of clicking a link to update.

Merging custom and official (rather than "default", which is a text 
domain) may not be that time-consuming. You can add any number of 
translation files to a domain (they're just keys of the global array 
l10n, after all). And the way that the gettext implementation merges 
entries/files/domains is basically "if it exists, do nothing" (not true 
for the loaded comments, though, but developer comments are basically 
unused, and highly useless once strings are translated). So, you'd only 
need to make sure your translation files are loaded before any other if 
you want to go this way?

I'm not sure if I follow you at all, though. I mean, you'd have missing 
translations as long as the source files are changed and you don't 
update your custom files, right? So you need to update your *custom 
translations* anyway, which is not that time-consuming (unless the 
source files are highly changed, that is).

Subject: [wp-hackers] switch to blog multisite
Message-ID: <D6D271B1-2095-4860-B7F4-D9AFE7A517CC@ramapo.edu>

Hi everyone,

Here's a crazy idea:

I have two multisite installs linked to the same database using shared wp_users and wp_usermeta tables and different prefixes. Sometimes, I need data from one network to be pulled into the other one. Is there any way to pull this off with switch_to_blog-ish approach? My idea - be able to switch to a blog on the other network, do things in a natural way using any wp functions and hooks I'm used to and then revert back to the original blog on the first network. Is something like that doable or should I just stick to raw MySQL queries at that point? Thanks!

Both networks have identical db connection (username/pass/domain/db/etc.) and configurations, only difference is the table prefix.

I'm not sure exactly what you have in mind, but WP Multi Network
(http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-multi-network/) should get you at
least part of the way there.

I think I figured out a way to do what I wanted, it was a little bit different from what you offered. I've attached the code just in case anyone else on the list ever needs to do this. Also, I'm open to feedback, it seems to be working so far but I can already anticipate an issue when switching from say wp_3 to prefix_3 because it will think it's the same blog and switch_to_blog will bail early. I'm working on that.

Message-ID: <CAFnKAk3vTo0iP5bBPHq7XH6x5b0-wFMD5wxGcbB6DKiM5wBK_A@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings all,

I noticed wp3.8 dashboard home shows extra columns when the screen is
resized - although it's not obvious to the user what or why there is a box
to drag more widgets to.

Is there a hook or global to set to change it to two columns all the time?
I tried setting the global $screen_layout_columns = 2; but it doesn't work.
Do I need to wait for this bug to be fixed?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Extra columns in 3.8?

Your screen needs to be at least 1500px for it to jump to three columns.
It's responsive, based on CSS media queries, not anything in PHP. The
obviousness of it could be looked at post-3.8.

There is probably a way to restrict the dashboard to 2 columns in PHP. It
might require adding back the screen option that had existed in 3.7. I'm
not aware of the global $screen_layout_columns doing anything.

Message-ID: <7BCE5D95-403E-4174-A8A2-8C5C3A5CB9E1@a5d.org>

Guys,

I?m updating my plugin for v3.8 and everything is going nicely except I cannot remove the ?WordPress news? dashboard panel.

Currently I can use variations of:
remove_meta_box('dash-right-now', 'dashboard', 'core')
or
remove_action('welcome_panel', 'wp_welcome_panel?)

But these now don?t work
I understand this element is now ?dashboard_primary? so I tried variations on a theme of:
remove_action('dashboard_primary', 'wp_dashboard_primary?) etc

but I?m obviously missing something as it still displays itself proudly.

Any ideas?

TIA

Whatever you were using in 3.7 with remove_meta_box() to remove the primary
news widget should work just fine in 3.8.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Strange post repetition issue
Message-ID: <CAAw0Uejo+=wd4RzF3XcJpy=t4VnX5jEOqr_NaXKGTcDDNwALdA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is my first mail to WP community :)

I have been developing a website for a friend and I have encountered a
strange issue.

Their are many post which are repeating randomly on various page

 example

http://scrollmore.com/category/fun/ (see fast and furious post)

and second page

http://scrollmore.com/category/fun/page/2/

it is repeating in the second page instead of showing next posts but their
is random post repetition in various pages.

Some single post repeat sometimes multiple posts repeats when we more to
older pages.

I am unable to find the issue behind this I have tried disabling all plugin
and even changing theme to default theme but it is still having the same
repeation issue.

I am certain that their is not error in theme because it used to work
correctly but suddenly it stopped working.

Can anybody guide me to direction where I can find solution to this or
debug this issue.

Regards

Well, I'd take a look at the $wp_query object. So in your template put some
code like this:

<?php
if ( isset( $_GET['testing'] ) {
    // Should already be available, but let's make sure it is
    global $wp_query;
    var_dump( $wp_query );
} ?>

And take a look at the source code of the page. Look for the query
parameters - see if something doesn't seem right in there. Usually on a
category archive you should only have the category(or category name - can't
remember precisely) and optionally the page parameters - everything else is
more than likely not coming from the WordPress core code.

This is really a support question, you should ask over on WP.org support
forums.

But the first question is to find out whether the posts are actually dupes
(are in the database like that) or is it a code problem.

Use PHPmySQL or some similar database tool and see if the posts are
actually duplicated in the database.  If they are, then there is a problem
with posting.  You're entering it several times?  Posting multiple
versions?  I don't know.

If they aren't in the database multiple times, then it's a display problem
 That's likely code in your "loop".  Or it could be the database server
spewing up multiples of the same record.  In any case, that's more of a
PHP issue.  There, I'd start with a good PHP debugger and step through the
loop and see if you are, in fact getting multiples of the same record each
time through the loop.

>From there you can determine what's the problem.  I hope.

Also the search results for one of the posts brings-up only one result as
well...

Subject: [wp-hackers] Multi Level Rewrite Rules with Dynamic Children
Message-ID: <1386463551342-43022.post@n5.nabble.com>

Trying to add a rewrite rule after a dynamic-ish subdirectory for the
username.  Current it is:

add_rewrite_rule('^member/([^/]*)/?', 'index.php?member=$matches[1]',
'top');

this creates the member/username but I would like to add additional rewrite
rules after the dynamic username level.  So :

add_rewrite_rule('^member/([^/]*)/messages/',
'index.php?member=$matches[1]', 'top');

I originally set it up as two seperate rewrite rules, one for messages and
one for username, but currently the messages is on the same level as the
username.  So you will be on site.com/member/yourname/ and then click
messages and it takes you to site.com/messages/72 or whatever the message
is.  

Id like to combine them ideally.  So like 

add_rewrite_rule('^member/(.+?)/messages/([^/]*)/?,
'index.php?member=$matches[1]&message=$matches[2]', 'top');

I tried this though without success.  I also downloaded a rewrite plugin
that helps with choosing the correct arguments, but it wasn't much help for
me in this situation.  Has anyone here ever done something like this? The
finished product would be  member/-dynamic-/message/-dynamic-/

I love the way codex has its pages.

Each long page is broken down into pieces and the contents of that page is
summed up by an awesome "table of contents". That TOC proves to be very
useful.

I'm curious to know what the core team deployed to achieve that?
What's the technique or plugin that pulls it off?

For example, on this page,

 what is it that creates the following and tying to the internal anchors?

I'm pretty sure the codex is using MediaWiki, not WordPress, and that's
just stock wiki functionality.

The Codex is powered by MediaWiki (the same software that powers
Wikipedia), which does this all automatically.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Database connection drops
Message-ID: <52A6D7FF.2050208@wordshell.net>

Hi,

It's amazing how slow some people's web hosting is. I'm currently 
looking at a log file of a backup of a site which takes over an hour to 
create a single 150Mb zip file (which does have 26,000 files in it).

It appears that after somewhere around 3000 seconds, the database 
connection is dropped, and all commands that result in talking to the 
database silently fail. For example, this returns no results:

$all_tables = $wpdb->get_results("SHOW TABLES", ARRAY_N);

As another example, the option which my code is using to save its state 
isn't updated after that time. The saved state is out-of-date. (At this 
point, that's not a huge problem, as I have lots of checks and balances).

If I use the scheduler to schedule a restart of the task a few seconds 
later, then everything works. $wpdb isn't getting over-written, as that 
would lead to fatal errors for methods not found instead of silent failure.

Has anyone come across something like that before? Does anyone know 
where in WordPress core this happens...

... and the important question: how to detect it/refresh the connection 
when it happens? At the moment I've thrown in a quick check at a key 
point, but on the test case I've seen, that comes about 10 minutes late. 
That's no problem, as everything in the code I've written is resumable 
and can detect and recover from failures like this. It'd just be good to 
not waste 10 minutes though.

Many thanks,
David

Message-ID: <52A7777D.8000600@topekadesign.com>

At what point does WordPress process short codes in content?

I have a short-code I created for displaying a custom Google map and I 
only want to load the necessary javascript files if the short-code is 
used on a page.  Are short-codes processed before the headers are sent 
to the browser or after?

Thanks!

Shortcodes are parsed at the the_content filter.

That said: you can simply call wp_enqueue_script() inside your shortcode
callback, which will ensure that your scripts only get enqueued when the
shortcode is parsed.

Thank you for your quick response.  I'll take a look at that.

That's interesting Chip. I thought that would have been too late.
Isn't it that when the "the_content()" is running, wp_head action hook has
already been executed?

If you call wp_enqueue_script() after the_header() then the script will be
enqueued in the footer. Dependencies will work as expected. (This wasn't
always the case, it was added in 3.3)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Is there a reason get_header/sidebar/footer() do
	nothave filters?
Message-ID: <CAHVkt5n_o4B+deXCHh2NuGXTgZFnGa-5-0hYFSeub=GFLDg36A@mail.gmail.com>

I recently went looking for the filter to change which sidebar is outputted
and was a little shocked to find there are no filters in get_sidebar() or
in get_header() and get_footer(). Does anyone know if this was a conscious
choice or not? If so, what was the reason?

I'd be happy to write a patch to add some, but I'm wondering if there is
some valid reason I'm missing for not using them?

What I really want to be able to do is something like this:

`
function mobile_sidebar( $name ) {
if ( wp_is_mobile() ) {
     $name = mobile;
  }
}
add_filter( 'the_sidebar', 'mobile_sidebar');
`

This would allow me to add different markup to the sidebar on mobile, to
change its size, location, use a jQuery plugin to make the sidebar slide in
and out, etc. I could also change which widget area is shown or show no
sidebar at all.

Thanks,
Josh

I'm assuming you'd do this in the theme, since it doesn't make a lot of
sense in a plugin (because the plugin would not have any idea about how the
theme's header/footer/sidebar is structured).

So, instead of just calling get_sidebar, why not do this instead?

if ( wp_is_mobile() ) {
  get_sidebar('mobile');
} else {
  get_sidebar();
}

Or something like that? A filter on these doesn't really add any
functionality that isn't relatively trivial to simply do elsewhere in the
theme, and again, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for a plugin to do
this sort of thing without intimate theme knowledge to begin with.

Otto-

That's a good point, but I don't want to have to do that for every single
template, so instead I replace get_sidebar() with my own function that
calls get_sidebar if !wp_is_mobile() . This especially sucks for child
themeing, Also I might do this in a plugin and do a template redirect to
load mobile-sidebar.php from the plugin directory, if it doesn't exist in
theme.

Greetings all,

I just found a serious inconsistency in the WP Tinymce:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26540#ticket

I'm curious if this is something that can be fixed in wp 3.8, or maybe the
next update 3.8.1??

Best regards

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using WP_Query "outside" of Wordpress by including
 wp-load.php inside a function
Message-ID: <CAHhnnU2r1A+xMN6Ym89q5Gxqv638kg=sjiNHv7NCeaJcV=ypjA@mail.gmail.com>

I get a couple referencing errors when trying to include wp-load.php from
within a PHP function on WP Multi Site.

public static function getEntries($options) {
@include_once('wordpress/wp-load.php');
if (function_exists('switch_to_blog')) {
switch_to_blog('...');

$options = array_merge(
array(
'post_type' => 'post',
'post_status' => 'publish',
'posts_per_page' => 10,
),
$options);

$query = new WP_Query($options);
...

After poking around a bit I found that I can make two small edits to make
this whole scenario work nicely.

in ms-settings.php:

global $wpdb;

and in wp-settings.php:

$GLOBALS['wp_query'] = $wp_the_query; // instead of $wp_query = ...

SO everything works great until we upgrade and all the changes get
clobbered. These changes are pretty minor - is this something that could be
committed? Does WP do pull requests?

For your particular use-case, you should be able to add
global $wpdb, $wp_query;
to before the include_once() line.

However, you may want to re-test under 3.8, I believe we altered a few
things in 3.7&3.8 to work better when included within a function..

Subject: [wp-hackers] Creating a news site on WordPress - some technical
	questions
Message-ID: <CAFaCOgzFN-ys7Znemy4jFReL9Q3NrhswPfXFByJtujhgRotCuw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm building a (pretty much) full scale news site with multiple editions,
e.g. US, UK, India, etc. on WordPress, and have a few questions on whether
I am doing things the right way. It'd be great if I can get some
advise/feedback from the experienced folks here.

Coming to the point, below are the details of the structure of the site,
and how I am fixing the hurdles along the way (on which I'd like some
feedback/advise).

- - -

*(1)* Each category (taxonomy) represents an Edition. To give you an idea,
they are as follows:

US (main)
UK (uk)
India (in)
International (intl)

NOTE: Permalink structure is
/%category%/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/, e.g.
example.com/main/2013/12/11/sample-post/.

PROBLEM #1: But as is the case with any news site, some posts need to be
shown across all Editions (for example, news on the death of Nelson
Mandela).

My Solution: I created another category - or Edition, so to speak - called
'International (intl)'. Then using [this function](
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b216cc899ce94f2fb4f7), I have the posts
assigned to 'International (intl)' category included in all category
archives.

PROBLEM #2: Posts belonging to 'International (intl)' category should be
accessible with any category slug in their permalink.

For example, if the permalink of the post that belongs to 'International
(intl)' category is
`example.com/intl/2013/12/11/sample-post/`<http://example.com/intl/2013/12/11/sample-post/>,
and it's being displayed in the 'US (main)' category archive, I want the
post to be accessible via
`example.com/main/2013/12/11/sample-post/`<http://example.com/main/2013/12/11/sample-post/>
.

To do that, I am using [this function](
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2c13d98f1330c313550c).

*(2)* Now I have perfect Editions (category archives) for different
countries; and as I've already used the category taxonomy, I created a
custom taxonomy called 'Channels' for organizing posts into topics. To give
you an idea, they are as follows:

Technology (tech) - example.com/channel/tech/
Science (science) - example.com/channel/science/
Business (business) - example.com/channel/business/

But since posts are primarily organized into *Editions*, I need archives
that list posts belonging to an Edition (category) AND Channel (custom
tax). Public query variables make this easy as I'd simply do something like:

example.com/?category_name=main&channel=tech

That'd be an archive for the 'Tech' Channel for the 'US' Edition. And to
prettify the links, I have a function with the necessary rewrite rules: <
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/22160578e145a67bc41a>

I do it similarly for tags as well.

- - -

That's it. Those are the heavy stuff. Am I doing things the right way, or
is that bad?

I didn't opt for WordPress Multisite, i.e. a sub-site for each Edition,
because it'd be hell a lot more difficult to have the same post across
multiple sites (Editions).

I'd very much like to know what you think. Please let me know if anything
is unclear. Thanks for your time!

Finally getting a chance to work on this after a busy week.

I created a ticket and a patch:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26636

This is my first time adding a filter to WordPress so I'd appreciate it if
anyone has any feedback or advice.

In general, this warning will be shown because the connection to
api.wordpress.org times out on a localhost.

You can normally ignore it, but it's worth verifying that outgoing HTTPS
connections can work.

I have this plugin which should hopefully let you know if there's any
issues:

Actually I've seen it happen on my VPS a couple of times, but I'm not
worried too much about it - I assume it's a temporary issue that happens
occasionally,

Thanks.

Just wanted the development team to know as in my opinion errors and 
warnings should be catched.

In general, this warning will be shown because the connection to
api.wordpress.org times out on a localhost.

You can normally ignore it, but it's worth verifying that outgoing HTTPS
connections can work.

I have this plugin which should hopefully let you know if there's any
issues:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Image caption shortcode format change
Message-ID: <CAG+zT3oNDN_EFramV507sF+DjUtqnnL3pcFoBxfwEur1-LfBHw@mail.gmail.com>

I was recently implementing a python shortcode parser and adding support
for [caption] shortcodes.

I ran into a snafu in trying to determine if the caption shortcode format
had an attribute called "caption" as one of the parameters.

It turns out before this commit on May 2012 it did:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/20679

This changeset removed the caption attribute. Around line 155 is what I am
talking about:


    $shcode = '[caption id="' . $id . '" align="align' . $align
     . '" width="' . $width . '" caption="' . $caption . '"]' . $html .
'[/caption]';

    $shcode = '[caption id="' . $id . '" align="align' . $align . '"
width="' . $width . '"]' . $html . ' ' . $caption . '[/caption]';

Was there a reason to remove the caption attribute? The shortcode becomes a
lot harder to parse dynamically.

People wanted to put HTML into their captions. Number one request for
captions, by far.

And <a href="whatever">Linked caption</a> becomes extremely difficult to do
when you have them in an attribute and thus have to fiddle with quotes in
the caption breaking the quotes around the attribute.

How about sticking a wp-caption class around the caption and wrapping it in
a span tag?


<span class="wp-caption">$caption</span>

This way you can actually parse it if needed.

Not really needed as the $html in

`[caption ...]' . $html . ' ' . $caption . '[/caption]`

is either an <img> or an <a><img></a> which can be extracted relatively 
easy. Here's the JS regex that does it in the editor: 
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wpeditimage/editor_plugin_src.js#L143

Gotcha. I do find the regex rather difficult to understand though. Also it
seems cleaner to give it a class so people can target it via jquery and css.

It sounds like a reasonable approach and seems to work for you. Are you
running into any specific issues?

Jeff,

No issues so far. Wanted to know if I am doing it wrongly, or if there's a
better approach.

(I usually ask questions on http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/ site, but
questions like these aren't allowed there.)

Subject: [wp-hackers] How Best to Import Users via command line script into
 sub sites on a Multisite Network
Message-ID: <7.0.0.16.2.20131218115640.0352c408@avantigroup.com>

Hi - Happy Holidays to all and here is hoping the WP-Hackers Santa 
Spirits and Code Elves can help me with the following ...

my question = does anybody know how best to import users via command 
line or via php script into sub sites on a Multisite Network ..??.. 
and/or know how best to go about extending a plugin that does import 
users into sub sites like, Cimy User Manager - 
http://wordpress.org/plugins/cimy-user-manager/ - e.g., with an api 
or other code that runs the plugin at command line ..??..

as fyi, Cimy User Manager seems to do a great job of loading a list 
of users via csv file into a sub site but this requires the GUI and a 
number of admin clicks ... thus got to thinking if it was possible to 
run a plugin at command line so initially i posted this thread -> 
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/api-or-method-to-import-users-from-command-line 
...

accordingly, any help or pointers that can be shared to add users via 
command line scripts is greatly appreciated ... to be continued ... 
cordially, chuck scott

wp-cli has this ability baked-in.

http://wp-cli.org/commands/user/

I cannot recommend it highly enough.

(wp-cli is, as you might guess, WordPress Command Line Interface)

Hi Jerry Milo Johnson - thanks for responding ... yes i'm aware of
wp-cli however i've not yet used it ... and while this command does
most of what i want, http://wp-cli.org/commands/user/import-csv/, the
docs and example make no mention of whether said CSV file can add
users to a particular site and not just add users to the network ...
thus this command, http://wp-cli.org/commands/user/set-role/, seems to
allow that control (user and role assigned to a sub blog) but is one
at a time ... so what i was hoping to do is import a CSV that also
assigned those users to various sub sites ... accordingly, do you know
if this is possible with the import-csv command or would i have to
first import-csv, then one by one run the set-role (ugh) ... lastly,
have you ever set up shell scripts to run these command lines ..??..
thanks in advance for any pointers shared ... cordially, chuck scott

Message-ID: <CAFnKAk15e_UCmj=jOq99NnJVHeDtip5gp8b2+iGQdTwDbRLi-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I was curious if anyone else noticed a problem on wp3.8. In some cases it's
missing some important files, causing the admin dashboard to show a sidebar
that is 100% width, no icons, really ugly. This seems to happen on many
sites, where it is missing a bunch of css files in wp-admin/css, and has no
wp-admin/css/color-schemes. It seems running the re-install fixes it for
all the cases I've seen it.

Best regards
Luke

That sounds more like a bunch of failed installs that didn't fully copy 
over files. Anything 'the same' with these sites?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Hierarchical Custom Post Type Issue
Message-ID: <6CCCDD09D5F24F4488807FF4C809FDD4@grady-etc.com>

?lo fellow hackers!

We are in the process of creating a new theme for one of our larger sites.  As part of this project a few thousand ?Pages? will be split into two hierarchical custom post types ? ?Services? and ?Support Items?.

All services get a rewrite slug of /service/, i.e.:
http://example.org/service/one
http://example.org/service/one/child

And all support items get a rewrite slug of /support/, i.e.:
http://example.org/support/one
http://example.org/support/one/child

We?ve run in to an issue during implementation ? requests for top-level ?Services? or ?Support Items? (post_parent = 0) are returning ALL posts of that post type that share the same slug (post_name).

As an example ? if the following ?Service? posts exist:
http://example.org/service/accounts/google
http://example.org/service/e-mail/google

And a request comes in for:
http://example.org/service/google

Instead of a 404, our single-service.php template is happily looping over those two posts.  If a ?/service/google? post exists, we get all three.

I?ve tracked this down to the following logic in wp-includes/query.php ? `WP_Query::get_posts()`:

```
if ( ! $ptype_obj->hierarchical || strpos($q[ $ptype_obj->query_var ], ?/?) === false ) {
// Non-hierarchical post_types & parent-level-hierarchical post_types can directly use ?name?
$q[?name?] = $q[ $ptype_obj->query_var ];
} else {
// Hierarchical post_types will operate through the
$q[?pagename?] = $q[ $ptype_obj->query_var ];
$q[?name?] = ??;
}
```

That branch in logic results in this query for top-level hierarchical posts:

SELECT wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts WHERE 1=1 AND wp_posts.post_name = ?google? AND wp_posts.post_type = ?support? ORDER BY wp_posts.post_date DESC

As opposed to this one for non-top-level hierarchical posts:

SELECT wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts WHERE 1=1 AND (wp_posts.ID = ?123?) AND wp_posts.post_type = ?support? ORDER BY wp_posts.post_date DESC

The latter results in exactly one ?Support Item? post, or a 404 if none are found (makes sense).  The former results in all ?Support Items? with a slug of ?google? (kind of crazy).

Why do requests for top-level custom hierarchical post type objects get special treatment?  I can work around it by adding filters to `parse_query` but I feel dirty doing it.

I was going to file a Trac ticket, but I figured I?d run it by the list first to make sure I?m not missing something obvious.

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [wp-hackers] Admin Color Schemes: generic classes for colors?
Message-ID: <52B461BA.9040402@duechiacchiere.it>

Hi folks,

we are trying to adapt our plugin to the new admin color schemes, and it 
would be great if we could have generic CSS class declarations that 
allow us to apply the current scheme's background/text colors to our 
elements. Something like

.admin-color-flat .sidebar-background-color{ background-color: #.... }
.admin-color-vineyard .sidebar-background-color{ background-color: #.... }

This would allow plugin developers to leverage those schemes without 
having to reinvent the wheel every time, and would make their plugins 
adapt to any third-party color scheme people may be using on their site.

Thank you,
Dino.

Hi Dino,

Why don't you try something like this:

function add_color_scheme_class( $class ) {
    $color = get_user_option( 'admin_color' );
    $class .= $color ? " admin-color-{$color} " : ' admin-color-fresh '/*
"fresh" is the default */;

    return $class;
}
add_filter( 'admin_body_class', 'add_color_scheme_class', 10 );

That should add the classes automatically for you - I know that you wanted
a core solution, but I assume for that it would be best to open a
ticket(you can do that here - http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ ).

Greetings,
Nikola

PS: I haven't tested the code, but it should work just fine.

Hi Nikola,

WordPress already adds the current color schema class to the body tag. 
But then I don't see anything in the CSS that I could use to recycle, 
let's say, the admin sidebar current background color and use it as the 
background color for my metabox headers. Yes, I could do this in jQuery, 
but I was hoping for a pure CSS approach.

Thank you and happy holidays,
Dino

Right - I didn't notice that :doh:

Now I see what you mean, and besides probably copy-pasting the values(or
using JS as you suggested) - which is obviously a very tedious approach, I
don't think you have a lot of options there.

Have a look at http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-color-schemes/

It has examples of adding other color schemes.

I was playing around with this stuff as well.
As far as I can tell you can only programmatically access the colours used for the preview color swatches and the icon colours:

global $_wp_admin_css_colors;
$color_scheme = get_user_option( 'admin_color' );

$_wp_admin_css_colors[$color_scheme]['colors']
$_wp_admin_css_colors[$color_scheme]['icon-colors']

Yes, we could copy and paste, but I'm already seeing a few plugins that 
add even more color schemes. It will soon become impossible to keep 
track of all of them ;) Asking admin theme developers to declare these 
generic classes would definitely help.

Best,
Dino.

Hi Chris,

yes, that plugin is exactly the reason why I posted my request ;) We 
don't want to further customize the admin interface, we just want to 
know what the current colors are (in CSS).

Thanks,

Thank you, Amy. It would however be helpful to also have access to 
wp-submenu-head and other colors that I can't seem to be able to find 
anywhere as a "more generic" class.

There doesn't seem to be an orderby option in WP_User_Query to orderby last
name field. This leaves me wondering why not and what the most direct way
to do so would be.

Does this not work?

new WP_User_Query(array(
   'meta_key'=>'last_name',
   'orderby'=>'meta_value',
));

The last name is not a field that exists in the users table. It's a meta
field. So you have to specify it and then order by the value of it.

Otto-

Works like a charm. I ended up needing to add `'fields'=>'all_with_meta'`
to the array so I could use 'last_name' and 'first_name' in the return
array.

Looks like this:
$users = new WP_User_Query(array(
   'meta_key'=>'last_name',
   'orderby'=>'meta_value',
 'fields'=>'all_with_meta'
));

Thanks,
Josh

Subject: [wp-hackers] Translating to a different language than the one
	installed
Message-ID: <52B57052.3000301@wordshell.net>

Hi,

I'm currently working on a plugin that sends back an informational 
message to a remote (WP) site.

The remote site's language might not be the same language as the remote 
site.

So, it seems that I need to locally translate the string to a different 
language than the one installed.

Alternatively, that might be the wrong solution; perhaps the translation 
should be done on the remote site, instead (so, the remote site would 
maintain a list of message codes, to be translated to strings).

Anyone got experience of this? If I did decide to try to translate 
locally, then is that even possible without gross hacks? (I think that 
translating on the local side might be preferable, because on the remote 
side, it's going to be plugins that developers build themselves using a 
toolkit I supply them, and I want to minimise the amount of work they 
have to do - though, I suppose, my 'toolkit' could have its own text 
domain and keep its translations separate, so that the developer won't 
have to fiddle with anything there).

Thanks for any insights!

Best wishes,
David

If you can keep a list of all possible strings locally (that is, you
know what the other end is outputting), then ideally you'd use noop'ed
translations.

Unfortunately, we don't have noop translations for non-plural strings.
You can fake it by just using the same string twice, of course. Then,
just pass it to translate_nooped_plural() after retrieving the result.

 guidelines for the new version of our plugin
Message-ID: <CAJ7gacqMk2YPZhYMXFPrq2Mjpz_MuEEiSm1ZwFjfij4TYN5gZg@mail.gmail.com>

The plugin is http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/. We
currently have three versions ( lite ( the one hosted on wordpress.org,
standard and pro on our website http://time.ly ). We are currently working
on version 2.0 which will unify the codebase and then we will sell
extensions from our website.

Our plugin provides a calendar for our user?s sites. One of the features we
currently offer in our free version is an ability for users to pull in
events on .ics feeds. This lets them easily populate their calendars with
events. We are working now on a 2.0 version and we would like to remove
this feature and have it available in our paid plugin extension. We feel
this feature is really for people who are using their calendar?s to
aggregate events. These are our event curators, and fit our model for Pro
users. We will be offering a temporary discount for our current users
allowing them to update to 2.0 and reinstall this extension for free.

We are concerned that we do not run afoul of rule number 5 in the plugin
guidelines, specifically- "Similarly, you cannot "cripple" functionality in
the plugin and then ask for payment or provide a code to unlock the
functionality?.

We do not believe this is crippling our plugin, as the core functions of
the calendar all remain, including offering site visitors the ability to
subscribe to events using their personal Google and Apple calendars,
however the term ?cripple? is somewhat open to interpretation.

What do you think?Is there someone i could ask directly?

.ics functionality is available in other calendar plugins for free, so
users could just jump onto another bandwagon. In my opinion, you're
definitely "crippling" or removing a function that was previously available
and asking payment for that functionality again.
Probably a mistake in marketing terms. Your "draw" is this functionality in
the free version, and much more spectacular advances when the user upgrades
to the paid version.
Again, my opinion only.

You should contact plugins at wordpress.org with this question. I don't think this is what is meant by crippling, but of course that is just my opinion.

Best to email plugins AT Wordpress.org for this one - that be the final call on repo rules.

Keep in mind, the real point of the rule is about serviceware. That is if your plugin is doing all the work (and not sending files to your own servers) then using a license check is totally against the rules. When we talk about crippling, we talk about the usefulness of the plugin. How much of the pro plugin is included in the free one? There's no set number, it's more about use.

As Eric said, this functionality is in other plugins, but more, are the majority of FREE users using this aspect? If so, it would be a bad marketing idea, but also bumping up on that crippling rule.

That is not what is meant by crippleware in that guideline. If the code is
in the plugin, but disabled until payment is made, then that is crippled.
If the code is something separate you must buy, then that is not.

You can't have code on WordPress.org that intentionally doesn't work. All
code in the plugin on the WordPress.org site should be functional and free.
But simply not including some code isn't "crippling" it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Development version of a theme
Message-ID: <7736CB02AB7B433EA1C4D05CBE6F0CD5@gmail.com>

Came up with something weird today, thought I would share.

A development version of a theme in a `themes/{theme-name}-dev`, which has a ton of development specific assets. Sass, uncompiled JS, documentation, Gruntfile, AI/PSD versions of images) to keep everything organized. 

All these assets build into a production version of the theme (`/themes/{theme-name}-theme`) via a grunt task, which includes only assets required to run the production version of the theme.

This limits exposure of some files that may need privacy while keeping everything in one location for development.

Under the GPL, you'd really just want to distribute the uncompiled
source code with your theme anyway though. Keeps things nice and easy
in regards to license compliance. It doesn't matter if you never use
wp_enqueue_script() / wp_enqueue_style() with the uncompiled files,
just that they are distributed with the theme.

That's of course assuming you're following 100% GPL rules of WP.org
anyway. Certainly doesn't matter if you aren't (under some
multi-license theme). What are you even referring to in regards to
"privacy"? Certainly your SASS doesn't need to be "private" from the
compiled CSS, neither does your un-minified JS.

You wouldn't maintain a separate development plugin with uncompiled
PHP source code, and then distribute a copy that's been compiled with
Zend Guard. Sure, it's encoding and code obfuscation, but it's really
the same thing that CSS/JS preprocessors and compressors do.

In my case, this means original image assets (vector versions of icons etc.) that shouldn?t be shared with the world, at least for client work. It would make sense to leave them in the theme folder if everything was released under the GPL.

An alternative is probably to ignore these files on deployment rather than separate them at the theme level.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Struggling with capabilities filter
Message-ID: <CAJbdpGsbV79GtEYNFMv6Yv5653Ls0VgWba8Fpx=d19-xM6HvKw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm struggling with a function for my RSVPMaker events scheduling plugin
that is supposed to allow users who to delegate other users to be
collaborators on an rsvpmaker post (an event or event template). In other
words, they grant users who are not otherwise designated as editors editing
rights to specific posts.

I have this working to the point where these "additional editors" can open
a post for editing. However, when an update is posted, I get a an error: *You
are not allowed to edit posts as this user*

The filter function appears to be adding the necessary capabilities, enough
to fool me into thinking I had this solved several times over.

My filter function is loosely based on the example from the codex
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/user_has_cap

add_filter( 'user_has_cap', 'rsvpmaker_cap_filter', 10, 3 );

function rsvpmaker_cap_filter( $allcaps, $cap, $args ) {

  if(!rsvpmaker_cap_filter_test($cap[0])) // only filter for rsvpmaker
capabilities
return $allcaps;
global $eds;
$user = $args[1];
$post_id = $args[2];
if($allcaps[$cap[0]]) // if already true
return $allcaps;
 if(!$eds[$post_id])
$eds[$post_id] = get_additional_editors($post_id);
 if(!$eds[$post_id])
return $allcaps;

if( in_array($user,$eds[$post_id]) )
{
foreach($cap as $value)
$allcaps[$value] = true;
}
return $allcaps;
}


I traced the error message to this routine in post.php and specifically to
a current_user_can test for the 'edit_others_rsvpmakers' capability.

if ( isset( $post_data['user_ID'] ) && ( $post_data['post_author'] !=
$post_data['user_ID'] )
 && *! current_user_can( $ptype->cap->edit_others_posts ) *) {
if ( $update ) {
if ( 'page' == $post_data['post_type'] )
return new WP_Error( 'edit_others_pages', __( 'You are not allowed to edit
pages as this user.' ) );
else
* return new WP_Error( 'edit_others_posts', __( 'You are not allowed to
edit posts as this user.' ) );*
} else {
if ( 'page' == $post_data['post_type'] )
return new WP_Error( 'edit_others_pages', __( 'You are not allowed to
create pages as this user.' ) );
else
return new WP_Error( 'edit_others_posts', __( 'You are not allowed to
create posts as this user.' ) );
}
}

By adding some debug code into my filter function and to post.php, I
determined that:

* In my filter function, $allcaps["edit_others_rsvpmakers"] is set to 1
before $allcaps is returned

* $ptype->cap->edit_others_posts evaluates to 'edit_others_rsvpmakers'

* current_user_can($ptype->cap->edit_others_posts) does not return either 1
or 0 - it doesn't appear to return anything.

The debug code inserted into post.php looks like this

$hascap = current_user_can( $ptype->cap->edit_others_posts );
print_r($hascap);

where the $hascap output should be, there's nothing so does that mean it's
not returning anything as opposed to returning NULL?

At any rate, I've been beating my head against this for hours and could use
some help.

Where am I screwing up? Or what am I not understanding?

never mind

turns out my mistake was relying on the post id to be passed the $args[2]
as indicated by the example code from the Codex. Looks like usually it is,
but not in the case of an update to a post. So I had to use the global
$post and $post->ID instead.

Is there a markdown library you guys would recommend?
I want to grab the base library and create a function out of that.

I found this http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/
I was wondering if you guys would recommend some other ones as well - for
me to take a look?

Thank you

PS: I do **not** need a markdown WordPress plug in -
I only need a PHP library for Markdown.
