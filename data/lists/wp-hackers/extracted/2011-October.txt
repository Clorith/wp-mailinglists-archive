Message-ID: <4E890427.3040307@dc-5.com>

Hi,

Not sure if this is the correct/appropriate place to ask the question 
but is there any kind of formal complaint system where I can request 
that the plugin be removed from the wordpress.org directory?

It has just come to our attention that a plugin, Smart Share Floating 
Buttons, which was launched earlier today on wordpress.org is an exact 
copy of a plugin we developed called slick social share buttons. In fact 
the plugin still contains links to our own website, where the "author" 
has forgotten to remove some of the links. The only changes made to the 
files are to change the author name and site to his own. In fact he 
couldnt actually be bothered to even rename files.

Although I have emailed the "author" I imagine it wont get very far with 
someone who steals code so blatantly.

Thanks

Lee

Email plugins at wordpress.org about it. Include links to the plugins in question.

If it were me I'd delete Windows, melt the CDs so no one is ever tempted 
run the install again, and then load linux and take it from there ;-)

And in that case, you could built a hotrod load balancer using Varnish.

The topic isnt exactly "cool" either. People put significant amount of 
work into developing plugins only to have others "steal" for want of a 
better word. I think the use of all caps rightly reflects the tone is 
was meant to portray

Whilst GPL license may "allow" such behaviour one would hope that 
Wordpress supports authors and assists in at least attempting to protect 
their hard work. Without some kind of control in the plugin directory it 
would become pointless continuing to develop plugins

While the GPL can giveth, the GPL can taketh away too.   :-)

-Mike 

P.S. The moral is: When you use (or operate in an ecosystem that uses) a license that allows anyone freedom to do whatever they want with your code, don't be surprised or upset when someone takes you up on that freedom.  It happens; just ask the guys at Jigowatt.

P.P.S. I'm not criticizing GPL or even complaining as I plan to release many months worth of work via GPL. But I am being lucid about when it means.

It may reflect the tone, but that doesn't make it permissible.  

http://codex.wordpress.org/Forum_Welcome

Check out the 'What not to do' section at the end, please.  There are guidelines for behavior on the forum, and if that WAS your account, now you know and it's all good. :)

Hey all,

Besides the PUploader in 3.3, what other significant changes will there be to Image management, especially at the API level?  I googled but couldn't easily find anything relevant, and searching trac was equally unfruitful.

The reason I ask is I need an Image class/API for a current project and I'd hate to reinvent the wheel if something similar is going to be included in 3.3; I'd rather work with that code or even contribute to bug fixing it. Alternately, anyone know of a good solid Image class/API in a GPL plugin or theme that I can consider using? 

Thanks in advance.

-Mike

The NextGEN plugin is one that is currently focused on images, and 
already widely used.

There are several improvements that can be made to it, a few that I've 
already found moving towards compatibility with the "post" post_type:
1. Tags for Albums and Galleries
2. Dates for Albums and Galleries
3. Publish status and scheduling for Albums, Galleries and Photos

I'm not sure where to begin submitting feedback on the plugin, I'm going 
to need to be doing improvements on the plugin myself, so obviously if 
there is a way to collaborate here, we could achieve something done to 
fit the needs of a a few.

What functionality do you actually need to get?
If you're looking for image manipulation functionality, maybe look at
including some of the Timthumb functions.
But 3.3 hasn't received much other than the new uploader comparedto 3.2
IIRC.

Thanks.  

I used NextGen a while back (had to hack it because of an unworkable database schema) but just I've reviewed it again for the image functionality (I should have mentioned that in advance) but it's strongly coupled to the NextGen end-user use-cases, and has much more complexity than I want to deal with, unfortunately.  I really need a code-level API that has no forced integration with any particular UI.

But I do appreciate the suggestion.

Basically I need encapsulated and decoupled upload, server-side cropping and alternate file-size generation, etc.  Imagine if WordPress had WP_File, WP_Image_File and WP_Image classes; that's what I need.

But it's okay if there's not much there. We can easily write it, but would hate to write it if there's going to be alternates to what we write in 3.3 that we'd need to retrofit.  And if they turn out good enough, maybe we'll put them on a trac ticket for review and possible inclusion into 3.4 or later.

Ah, well yes it does have that functionality.. Just not through those handy
Classes.
The File upload handlers have (for a long time) accepted any upload that you
trigger them with, and has the ability to set custom image sizes which might
be croped. There's hooks for meta geenration at which you can trigger other
image manipulations (such as croping a image via POST data).
Ultimately, it's not handed to you on a silver platter, but the
functionality you need are there - I suspect you'll write it yourself though
out of frustration from there not being a clear example as how to achieve
that all though.

Thanks. I've been through all of the image management code in WordPress 3.2. My secret weapon(tm) PhpStorm+Zend Debugger makes it pretty easy it figure out pretty much anything I need to understand in WordPress core.

The problem with what's there is mostly too coupled to existing UI use-cases in WordPress that don't apply to our needs, and using it is more trouble than writing it directly. There are of course some function I can and am using/will use, but overall it's not what we need; the coupling is too high.

For example, here are (some of) the WordPress core functions that contain the raw image functionality needed:

wp_save_image()
wp_crop_image()
wp_load_image()
stream_preview_image()
_crop_image_resource()
_flip_image_resource()
image_resize()
wp_save_image_file()
wp_stream_image()
media_handle_upload()
wp_handle_upload()
media_upload_image()
media_upload_file()

Let's take a look: 

wp_save_image() accepts an attachment_id and assumes that $_POST has values for 'fwidth', 'fheight', 'target', 'do', etc. and a lot more coupling.  So it can really only be used for the use-case where admin-ajax.php is called with $action is 'image-editor.'

wp_crop_image() is useful, and I'll probably use it. Ironic though that sitting beside wp_save_image() you would not expect it to take 9 parameters when wp_save_image() takes one and is used in completely different contexts. So much for API consistency. :)

wp_load_image() is useful and I'll probably use it, but only marginally so because it doesn't do much more than call imagecreatefromstring().

I could continue, but hopefully you get the idea.  I think it'll actually be easier to write the classes then retrofit whatever WordPress core has in place of the code we write where possible. Trying to deal with the dependencies during development of those classes when it's hard to even know what the dependencies are is probably too much trouble during initial development.

So a set of consistent and easy-to-use Image/File API classes for WordPress would be really useful. And since we need them for a project I guess that's what we are going to build.  We'll use whatever we can from core and we'll write code for where WordPress doesn't have what's needed.

How are users of "stolen" plugins going to be affected? Or will they be? Those who have downloaded and installed the copy-cat plugins, would they have to stop using the plugin? Just some thoughts that came to mind when I read about this.

The following resources are very helpful when developing and testing themes:

1. http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-check/ -- A plug-in that
checks your theme for common mistakes and provides helpful suggestions.

2. http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test -- Some made-up data to
populate your database to better examine your theme under different
circumstances.

Cheers,
Harish

I have been worrying about this also. 

I may have this wrong, but looking at the back end implementation,
transients appears to back on directly to the options API. Now at times,
this calls "wp_load_alloptions()"


function get_transient( $transient ) {
      // ....snip

			// If option is not in alloptions, it is not autoloaded and thus has a timeout
			$alloptions = wp_load_alloptions();
      // .... snip
}

which in turn looks like this...


function wp_load_alloptions() { 
              // ....snip

		if ( !$alloptions_db = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT option_name, option_value FROM $wpdb->options WHERE autoload = 'yes'" ) )
			$alloptions_db = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT option_name, option_value FROM $wpdb->options" );
              // ....snip
}


So, it seems to me, that extensive use of the transients API with big
things is going to come with a substantial performance problem.
Potentially, this will affect not just "get_transient" calls but also
anything that results in wp_load_alloptions() being called. 

The reason I mention this, is I have tried putting a reasonable amount
of stuff (100's of records, although not individually large) into
transients. I also appear to be getting some memory issues, and I am a
bit suspicious that this is transients, but haven't had time to
investigate really heavily. 

I was thinking of rewriting the entire thing as a custom post type,
although this seems a pity as the transients API otherwise does (nearly)
what I need. 

Am I barking up the wrong tree here? Have I totally misunderstood the
implementation?

The GPL doesn't allow what he is claiming. He says that his author name
has been removed. GPL allows you to use other peoples content, but the
copyright on that content remains with the originators. The GPL requires
"appropriate copyright notice" on modified forms; as the copyright
remains (in part) with the original author this would have to be
included. 

The GPL does allow you rebadge things; but you have to be clear that
this is what you have done.

*TL;DR*: Add an explicit copyright attribution and license declaration to
your code, if you expect others to retain them.

I note that you don't actually have a copyright attribution in your original
Plugin (or, for that matter, a license declaration), in either the primary
Plugin file<http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/slick-social-share-buttons/tags/1.3/dcwp_slick_social_buttons.php>or
in the readme
file<http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/slick-social-share-buttons/tags/1.3/readme.txt>.
This
is a bit of a problem with WordPress Plugins and Themes, because most
developers do not properly/adequately attribute their *own* code. (I found
this to be true even among core developers, in a Plugin
audit<http://www.chipbennett.net/2010/02/10/auditing-wordpress-plugins-for-license-information/>almost
two years ago; I suspect that little has changed.)

Note that GNU recommends this format for copyright attribution:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html

Copied out of some of my own code, for example:


 * Oenology WordPress Theme, Copyright (C) 2010 Chip Bennett
 *
 * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 * the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
 * (at your option) any later version.
 *
 * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 * GNU General Public License for more details.


For Themes, one would expect to see this attribution/disclaimer in the
header comments in style.css. For Plugins, one would expect to see this
attribution/disclaimer in the phpDoc header docblock in the primary Plugin
PHP file. Note also that phpDoc includes @copyright and @license tags, that
can and should be used where appropriate.

The important part of the GNU-recommended attribution is the *copyright
statement*. If you include it, you can reasonably and legally expect that
any derivative (or re-distributed) work will retain it; however, if you fail
to include this attribution, it is unreasonable to expect that someone else
is going to create it for you.

Personally, I'd love to see a bit more education of WordPress Theme/Plugin
developers regarding the proper method of code copyright attribution and
license declaration. With WPORG-hosted Themes, at least explicit
License/License URI declaration is required (though we don't currently
address copyright attribution). Plugins have... well, an (IMHO) legally
non-binding statement here <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/> that
Plugins are "explicitly" (whereby the definition of "explicit" is bludgeoned
into a semblance of "implicit") licensed as GPL if no license declaration
exists.

So, we've somewhat brought on a "wild west" environment upon ourselves, with
respect to modified/re-distributed code. While on one hand some people will
have nefarious intent, and won't follow convention even if convention is
established, on the other hand, even people who intend to follow convention
- and who intend to attribute copyright properly when they
modify/redistribute code - are stymied by a lack of convention with in the
WordPress developer community, and by a lack of education regarding what the
license *itself* (er, GNU) recommends.

Transients get autoload = 'no' when they have an expiration.

function set_transient( $transient, $value, $expiration = 0 ) {
   ...
			$autoload = 'yes';
			if ( $expiration ) {
				$autoload = 'no';
				add_option( $transient_timeout, time() + $expiration, '', 'no' );
  ...
}

You snipped the part where the results get cached; in regular usage, that
SQL query shouldn't get executed again on subsequent calls to
wp_load_alloptions() so I wouldn't worry about it too much.

@jhay

I remember WordPress.org stopped distribution of some plugins after they
were reported for including spam/viruses (the whole base64 cleanup a while
back). I would assume the same would happen here with removed plugins:
* Mainly the auto-updates would stop working and the plugin would disappear
from the .org plugin directory
* No users with the plugin installed would have the plugins deleted from
their servers
* The plugin author might be warned, or have their .org account deleted

And, since WordPress is more-complete now than a few years ago, there might
even be some notice given to users via the Plugins page.
(I'd have to review the code in core to see if that's supported - if not,
that's a good idea for a new feature.)

Not much to it, really.

-Go to the plugin.
-Click the Admin link in the menu bar.
-Add the user's wordpress.org username to the committers list for the plugin.
-Wait an hour or so for it to take effect.
-Done.

Subject: [wp-hackers] AWE
Message-ID: <4E8A6022.3090105@braydon.com>

Hello,

I have been working on a free software solution to social networking. 
Many projects are focused on starting from scratch, such as; Freedom 
Box, StatusNet, Diaspora, and Libre.fm. My approach is different because 
I am planning on building upon what is currently already at the heart of 
social media, WordPress, and just fixing one problem --- those pesky 
share buttons everywhere. I have just completed PHASE 1 of the project, 
and would like to make this the first public release, which does not 
include all the required features.

In the same way that people will post links of WordPress posts to Social 
Media websites, the goal of this is to automatically cross-post to a 
community of websites for promotional purposes and is a distributed 
method for online marketing campaigns. This will not  require a visitor 
to leave to visit the post, since it is copied verbatim, and does not 
require users to be either a member of a network or not a member. This 
will serve as two-way posting making it possible for a dialog between 
separate websites and community organization. I am terming it "networked 
media" to be distinguished from "social media".

Websites are built in the millions for publishing articles, videos, 
music and linking these to Social Media websites for promotion. My goal 
is to build new networked media websites that bring together a community 
of individuals based upon topics of interest; opening the opportunity 
for verticals and topic based networked media websites as opposed to 
Social Media differentiated by differences of software.

That is the goal. This is the future of online marketing. Now, here is 
what I have made. I have started with a method to define new URLS and 
templates, and am currently working on the aggregation portion. Here are 
the links to the resources for the plugin:

WordPress Plugin Directory:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/awe/

SVN:
http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/awe/trunk/

Project Management ( Documentation / Tickets / Git ):
http://code.braydon.com/p/awe/

Here are the phases of the project I have been planning:

1. URLS/Templates:

    * Editing URLS
    * Managing Menus
    * Editing Templates
    * Feed reader for synchronization

2. JavaScript Templates:

    * JavaScript URL routing
    * JavaScript Templates
    * NoScript accessibility

3. Admin Interface:

    * Unified front-end/back-end interface
    * JavaScript admin that is extensible

4. Complete WordPress Distribution:

    * Packaging the plugin as a part of WordPress
    * Clean API for our JavaScript applications
    * OpenID for network to network authentication and privacy

5. AWE Plugins:

    * Write extensions to the core of AWE to add new post types
      including: video, sound, gallery, events and shop.

6. Web Service:

    * Dedicated web host for users that don't want to run it on their
      own hardware.
    * Sign-up and payment settings.

For those that I have previously contacted about URL routing, this is 
the plugin I was mentioning. I am now looking to work in collaboration 
because this project can not succeed without the support of a few people 
working in synchronization. So let's get going!

Sincerely,

Having it be a plugin that comes with WordPress, like Akismet, as an 
alternative distribution to make setup faster and easier. I am planning 
on using this plugin for all my development going forward, and would 
like it to be as optimized as possible.

That's how I took it also but assumed I must be mistaken since it's so 
clearly plugin material and not something we'd do in core.

I would suggest removing this one from your plan. The core team 
eventually intends to unbundle Akismet from core and probably shift to 
more of a "featured" plugin model for functionality that the core team 
recommends but doesn't think belongs in core itself. As it was discussed 
at last year's core team meetup, Akismet will stay bundled until such 
time as we have a more generic antispam plugin that could plug in to any 
service (not Just Akismet), but in the meantime, we don't want to ship 
without an anti-spam solution. There are no plans to bundle any 
additional plugins.

No, it not something that many people want it as a core thing. Also I don't
think it going to be part of the wordpress package like Akismet is. I could
be wrong, but for now I'm thinking it won't happen.

Am I understanding correctly that the point is for you to create a post 
that is automatically remote posted to X other blogs at the same time X 
other blogs are automatically posting to your site?

Yes, that is the idea. Email is two-way, so this is for two-way blog 
posting. It would be possible to be an aggregate only.

If you do it this way, it is *much* harder. Make it work with plain old
semantic html (posh) first, then add the fancy JavaScript interaction on
top. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement

By the way, I think it is unlikely Google et al will smile benignly on
anyone doing automatic content copying across multiple sites!

So, spam, basically? (I'm just saying what a bunch of people are already 
thinking, and Mike alluded to re Google not taking it kindly.)

Yes, I've already turned indexing off on my own site I've been 
experimenting with the idea on ( http://braydon.com/network/ ) because 
it was cluttering their results with my cross-posts. That is why I was 
thinking it would be okay to go with the JavaScript way for faster 
interactions, though the non-standard/accessible approach....

This might be a reason for an aggregate style exclusive site that 
wouldn't need search indexing. Though many people, not businesses, are 
not worried about ranking on search results, and would rather not be for 
privacy....

Not spam, because you'd be able to subscribe/unsubscribe. Same as you 
can follow on wordpress.com now, but more integrated and in the same 
flow on your own theme. Somewhat like the interactions with the P2 
Theme, but networked between blogs.

I've turned indexing off with my experiment locally ( 
http://braydon.com/network/ ) because of search engine spamming, and 
don't mind not having my site indexed. I've also tried not having 
permanent links for cross-posts (a.l.a.) the live feed bottom right at 
Poobah.com, which is just an RSS reader.... What I have setup at 
http://halocyan.com/community only copies an excerpt. So non of these 
are having those issues.

While your goals may be to create information for communities, I think 
this plugin would quickly be abused. I'm sure it is something that the 
URL resellers and domain parkers will absolutely love. It will get 
content for their sites so they can build some page rank before they 
bleed someone dry on the sale of the domain.  Overdone this would create 
a bunch of sites that are exactly identical except for the url and maybe 
theme. So you could create a bunch of entry points to the same content 
you are selling - "work for google from home" sites will love this.   A 
practical use of this might be an ad network whose distributed content 
never goes away - but if you experienced Google's wrath on text link 
ads, post text ads sure won't be appreciated more.

Maybe I'm just seeing the ways this would be abused, or I'm simply not a 
member of your target audience, but I think you're gonna have some 
convincing to do to get buy-in from the community at large.

When you couple abuse with the fact that participation DROPS with auto-generated content (see the 70% drop off reported in Facebook likes for auto-posted links), you've got a very niche audience.  I can see using this in an internal network, but I'm not sure that two way posting would be as effective since you'd lose any comments between the sites (and my current buggaboo with sharing content between teams at work has been how to retain comments and edits so you only have ONE place to update the ding dang stuff and not MORE).

But with this:

I think your promotion would be better served with quotes and then "This is why, dear my community, this is important to US!" Copying an excerpt is (pretty much always in my experience) the way to go.  Then you personalize it.  Otherwise you'd kinda invented the robo-call of the blogging world.

I can see using this in an internal network, but I'm not sure that two way posting would be as effective since you'd lose any comments between the sites (and my current buggaboo with sharing content between teams at work has been how to retain comments and edits so you only have ONE place to update the ding dang stuff and not MORE).
If posts are two-way, the need for comments reduces. Since one post 
could be in reply to another post. Though details would need to be 
worked out with this. This would also mean that in order to reply two 
people would need to be subscribed to each other, and also solving the 
problem of bots spamming comments.

I don't think an excerpt is enough, because then you're required to go

Yeah, tis something to think about.  There has to be easy handling in a commentless scenario but also common sense allowable as well.

>> I think your promotion would be better served with quotes and then "This is why, dear my community, this is important to US!" Copying an excerpt is (pretty much always in my experience) the way to go.  Then you personalize it.  Otherwise you'd kinda invented the robo-call of the blogging world.

And yet... A promotion is to draw the reader to the 'source' right?  If Ford wants to slap promotions of my cool car blog, their end goal is more visitors for THEM.  My end goal is more readers for me.  In the middle we have the work of "I'll link to you and tell people to go visit you, BUT I want them to make a pit stop to learn how super cool I am too!"  Quid pro quo, Clarice.

Which goes back to the comments issue.  In a self-contained network, this isn't a problem (or rather, it's a problem, but far easier to handle).  In the wild word, if I'm pulling in content from another site, it has to be beneficial to ME, and comments drive community on your own site. I do know that's not your intended use case (or not one you mentioned) but it's something to think about for elegant growth.

Yes this is the ultimate goal, so the big supporters find their way to 
back to the source. However bringing lots of traffic isn't the goal, and 
could actually be a benefit of having bandwidth weight and huge spikes 
it hits distributed across a network.

Hmmm. If it's getting memory cached, this might also be a problem!

It's not clear to me from the documentation what the expectation is for
the transients API, and what sort of scale of usage it is meant to take.
Currently, I am putting XML documents describing metadata for
bibliographics references into it; it works fine where there are several
hundred, but I do wonder whether it will scale to many thousands.

In the end, I'll probably port this to Custom Posts for other reasons (I
want to control the expiration more), but it's good to know in that it
shouldn't explode in the short term.

It sounds like you are trying to recreate some/most of the 
functionality of trackbacks. Mike

I'm working on a process that requires a cron job and would prefer to execute the PHP script directly instead of using cURL to execute the code via the Web server. In the past, I've bootstrapped WordPress, through trial and error and Googling like this:
require('<path-to>/wp-config.php');
$wp->init();
$wp->parse_request();
$wp->query_posts();
$wp->register_globals();
Is there a preferred method for bootstrapping, or is this as good as any?
Cheers!

I was shown this method (assuming PHP script is in the docroot):

// Turn off errors as we're sort of outside wordpress
// and the browser and that can cause warnings
define('WP_DEBUG', false);

// Require the standard WordPress header
require(dirname(__FILE__).'/wp-blog-header.php');

If you have content on your site that is exactly identical to content 
that is on other sites, Google will reduce your page rank and you won't 
often come up in the results because you will be classified as a spam 
blog (splog).  That's why it is important to actively fight splogs that 
steal your content.  Probably the best way to do so is to notify Google 
of their existence in webmaster tools to get them removed from the 
index. Contacting the splogs will have mixed results at best.

The concern about this plugin is that it would viewed as sort of gray 
hat splogging :) because it is voluntary.

If you don't plan on doing something that visually themed like your 
site, you can just include wp-load.php.

I put a sample script for doing this sort of thing up on GitHub.

Here: 
https://github.com/brianlayman/WordPress-Manipulator/blob/master/wpmanip.php

It demonstrates a bunch of techniques.  It takes parameters from CLI or 
your browser.  It loads the WP environment and access the WP API 
directly as well as demonstrates how to curl into the wp-admin area of a 
site to automate things.

Maybe you'll find it helpful.

If you don't plan on doing something that visually themed like your site, you can just include wp-load.php.

I put a sample script for doing this sort of thing up on GitHub.

Here: 
https://github.com/brianlayman/WordPress-Manipulator/blob/master/wpmanip.php

It demonstrates a bunch of techniques.  It takes parameters from CLI or your browser.  It loads the WP environment and access the WP API directly as well as demonstrates how to curl into the wp-admin area of a site to automate things.

Maybe you'll find it helpful.

Of course, this now raises the question of handling a multisite install. Is there a way to bootstrap WordPress and then specify the blog to execute against?

You can also just use wp-load.php. That will load up everything, although there's a variable (that I forget) that allows you to turn off plugins.

Okay, so I can use the prefix_blogs table to get a list of blogs in a multisite install and then use switch_to_blog() to iterate through them, but is there a WP function that returns a list of active blog IDs? Checking the functions list and trac I see a lot of potential options, but it's unclear what the sanctioned method is.

I see, I was hoping to add a committer but retain sole control over releases. Sounds like it's an all or nothing proposition.

Not sure how you expected that to work.  Did you want to give them commit
access only to trunk but keep them from tagging new releases?  That's not
quite how Svn works.  If you want something more distributed, I recommend
setting up a Git repository somewhere and giving your developers access to
that.  That gives you distributed version control with your team.  Keep the
Svn repo through WordPress separate if you want to retain control over
releases.

Or go the WordPress route (using Core development as a model) and have your
developers submit patches which you then either accept and merge or reject.

Remember, committer == manager when you're talking about Subversion.

Why not host the project on a separate server that you can add committers to, e.g. GitHub, and maintain sole control over the plugin on worpdress.org?

Have you considered GitHub? You can give others push access to a development
version on GitHub, and then determine when to tag/commit to SVN.

Message-ID: <CAJxFMSDfqm85zRBOk+a-9Vr=KngK5tm7YFXNZDbR5=rTZXhquQ@mail.gmail.com>

I use the following code to customise which icons a client has available on
the TinyMCE toolbar:

add_filter( 'tiny_mce_before_init', array( $this, 'wysiwyg_defaults' ) );

function wysiwyg_defaults( $initArray ) {

        if ( ! current_user_can( 'use_wordpress_full_admin' ) ) {

            $initArray['theme_advanced_blockformats'] = 'p,h2,h3';

            $initArray['theme_advanced_buttons1'] =
'pastetext,|,|,formatselect,|,|,bold,italic,|,|,bullist,|,|,link,unlink,|,|,spellchecker,|,|,fullscreen';
            $initArray['theme_advanced_buttons2'] = '';
            $initArray['theme_advanced_buttons3'] = '';

            $initArray['spellchecker_languages'] = 'English=en';

        }

        return $initArray;

}

Is there any way I can specify default icons for the distraction-free mode
too? (currently I'm using CSS to hide a couple of unwanted buttons.)

Thanks

Thanks, I had over estimated the feature set of svn! GitHub is probably a good choice.

Message-ID: <002d01cc82d8$55dff830$0100a8c0@corpfe1f3cd943>

I tried everything but still can't disable or modify image dimensions. I know how to disable some features but these two seems different someway.

Thanks a lot

In your functions:

define( 'HEADER_IMAGE_WIDTH', apply_filters( 'twentyeleven_header_image_width', 1000 ) );
define( 'HEADER_IMAGE_HEIGHT', apply_filters( 'twentyeleven_header_image_height', 200 ) );

I've noticed that I then have to upload an image for it to start using the right image size, though.

Hi,

I use the following plugin http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajax-thumbnail-rebuild/ whenever I need to regenerate image sizes because I changed them. I don't leave the plugin active but just enable it when I need it.

Just to come to the defence of SVN here...

SVN when served via HTTP (at least, as that's the only experience I have of
it) can have permissions applied to any specific directory within the tree.
User1 has access to /, User2 can only commit to /trunk/, user3 can do
/trunk/ and /branches/, User4 can only do /trunk/translations/ etc - The
.org plugin repo is a good example really, all plugins are stored within the
same repo, with different permissions for different paths!

However, for ease of administration, the WordPress.org Plugin directory only
does it based on a a plugin slug itself, the number of multi-committor
projects is rather small (from what I know) and generally.. you trust the
person you're adding as a committor to a project.

To go into some more details.. the readme.txt file can specify trunk as the
stable tag anyway.. so a rouge committor to /trunk/ could still release a
release if they wanted to..

So:
 - SVN isn't as unfriendly as most people make it out to be
 - .org repositories are setup for ease of management
 - The number of people who would request for fine-grained permission set is
IMO probably quite small
 - If release management is what you're after, that'd probably best done as
an addition to the .org plugin bundler/etc rather than at the SVN level
anyway..

So for now: Publishing to GitHub/other providers is a good solution if you
want to allow people to have commit access, whilst still retaining control
over what is released on WordPress.org.

It is a solution, but I'm not quite sure why you don't trust your contributors to discuss with you and defer to you about release management.

The best way to manage open-source project access permission is to give someone the access to do everything and the permission to do a limited set of things.

If you don't trust them you shouldn't be giving them commit access, if you do trust them then you will be happy to give them more access than they need because it makes setting everything up simple.

Message-ID: <006701cc837c$7eade250$0100a8c0@corpfe1f3cd943>

I had this solved in previous WP version:

When listing a taxonomy archive (i.e. taxonomy is 'flavors' and trying to access http://site.com/flavors), in previous version I only had to visit Permalinks page to re-write the permalinks for this new taxonomy.

Now, it seems doesn't work anymore.

I have a taxonomy 'genres' for 'art post type, 'this way:

  register_taxonomy('genres','art', array(
    'hierarchical' => true,
    'labels' => $labels,
    'show_ui' => true,
    'query_var' => true,
    'rewrite' => array( 'slug' => 'genres', 'with_front' => FALSE ),
  ));

Whenever a try to access the /genres, I get a 404. 

Is this issue back again?! Something to do with permalinks structure in use? I do have to create a taxonomy-{taxonomy}.php for every taxonomy?

Thanks

Agreed with Dion on SVN, having a trusted team is far better regardless of
the VC system in use. Even with GitHub, unless you're doing very thorough
code reviews on every pull ... then someone could slip bad/evil code in.

Remember the WordPress plugin repo is that it's still a partly-manual
system, http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/. Perhaps someone from
Automattic could convince their future Community Handyman,
http://automattic.com/work-with-us/community-handyman/ to update the
plugin/SVN interface. Maybe something with a more-automated signup, with an
'owner' user, a separate "deploy" option, and more-granular permissions that
the plugin admin could control in a web UI.

(admittedly, I'm applying to be that Handyman...)

that wp_redirect() is still viable?

Thanks,

Shortcodes are parsed/called at display time, by the time the shortcode
function is called, the header and some posts may/will have printed.

Your only real option is to hook in early on template_redirect (or similar)
and scan through $wp_query->posts manually looking for the shortcode, and
handling it there..

A shortcode might not be the best option for what you're trying to achieve?
what are the reasons you've gone with a shortcode?

Hello,

I've written a script to process a complex import of users from one system into wordpress. The only part I'm having issue with is generating each users password, as from the database they don't' appear to be straight MD5 hashes of passwords.

Can anyone shed any light on the correct way to generate passwords?

Are they concatenated salt and hashes?

You can use wp_hash_password. I don't know how are you creating users,
but you may want to use wp_insert_user which takes care of that.

I gather you're doing a direct SQL conversion and not through PHP/including
WordPress?
WordPress uses "PHPAss" hashes, you can find the function responsible here:
wp_hash_password():

User records are now already in place, so I just need to update a few fields and passwords. I'll dig into wp_hash_password, thank you!

It is much more secure to use the modern password hashes, but
WordPress will work with plain old MD5 password hashes too. It will
automatically re-hash on first login, in wp_check_password().

But, it looks like the shortcode mechanism just plain will not work.

In light of this, what mechanism would be best for this situation?
Post meta? Custom field?

Thanks, this is a new area for me.

Claude, I have a code snippet at http://thisismyurl.com/blog/2011/01/19/redirecting-a-wordpress-post-with-custom-fields/ that will do it, although looking at it ... i should really update that so it's better.

Here's a better function for your functions.php file that will fire before WordPress generates the page.

Now, add a custom field to your Post named "redirect" and if it's present, it'll cause a redirect.

Claude,

I'd also recommend that you look at the External Permalinks Redux (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/external-permalinks-redux/) and Page
Links To (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page-links-to/) plugins.

Both allow you to specify a URL to redirect a post or page to. External
Permalinks Redux also works with custom post types.

Full disclosure: I'm the author of External Permalinks Redux.

Erick

hah I just wrote the same thing, importing from a CSV file, creating the 
user and assigning password if needed, an then associating with a blog 
if it does not already exist.

I simply used  wp_generate_password( 12, false ) to create a new random 
password:
http://hitchhackerguide.com/2011/02/12/wp_generate_password/

One thing to note is that you CAN use a straight md5 of a text value in 
the password field. That's the original password encryption method for 
WordPress and it will be recognized.  The upgrade code is still in place 
in the core so the password encryption will be upgraded to the new 
method the next time the person logs in. (It has to be done when a 
person is logging in so that the unhashed text is known.)

In a similar vein, but without your client needing to add a custom field
(which is difficult for non-technical users), here is an update of Owen
Winkler's old Redirectify plugin which presents a meta box to type the URL
into.
http://pastebin.com/E9pH2rSW

I've kept it as simple as possible, hopefully you'll be able to follow the
code.

Christopher,

Thanks for the great head start on the code.
It gives me the perfect start. I can insert my cookie code. Look to
see if it is time to redirect or let them through to the desired page.
Very nice.

Thanks,
Claude

Have a look at the 'wp_fullscreen_buttons' filter.

Hey Eric,

Thanks for the mention these two plugins. We currently use the
page-links-to. Will have to take a look at the external permalinks
redux :)

The page-links-to plugin does its job well. I just need a means to
insert code that will test on a cookie and if the cookie is present
NOT redirect. Or if cookie is missing redirect.

Examining the External Permalinks Redux code it looks like I can hook
into the "get_post_metadata" filter for my test. Then return an array
with element 0 = "" if I want to not allow the redirect to go through.

I will definitely look into this arrangement.

Thanks,
Claude
p.s. your code is nicely commented. Is that an example of wordpress
suggested best practices for documenting functions? It looks very much
like the required format we used at Cisco in the java team I was
working with.

this is crazy off-topic, but in case any of your sites or plugins
are using the Playtagger audio player from Delicious:
that script and Flash player are gone. (maybe a Yahoo! change in  
Delicious service).

anyroad, here's a quick, dirty fix making it possible to use files

I like the idea of easier client update.

Yeah, just to explain my special situation...

I've released a plugin, JSON API that we rely on for our website at MoMA.org. If it were compromised this wouldn't just be an inconvenience, we could lose our capacity to process credit card transactions. So I'm trying to err on the side of caution.

That is balanced against a desire to support extensions to the plugin that I don't require and don't have time to implement. I've been contacted folks who certainly strike me as responsible, but who I haven't met in person. I have no reason to doubt their trustworthiness, and I'd like the plugin to accommodate as many varied use cases as possible.

The plugin already has a GitHub presence, but managing pull requests and merging changes is something that doesn't take a high priority in my work day. So basically I'd prefer to accept commits on a single "primary repo" and be able to just review and release without feeling nervous imposing more risk. I realize all of this isn't a typical setup, so I definitely understand the limitations currently in place on the SVN repos.

Thanks for all the replies!

-Dan

I would reccomend putting filters and actions in place that allow these
other features to function properly and live as there own plugins then.  It
should be easy enough to manage the pull requests or patches for filters and
actions.

Hi everyone,

Can I make a single page (lets say *domain.com/api/main*) to render
different sites of a Multisite setup programmatically?

Like render output on *domain.com/api/main* as if it was *a.domain.com* or *
b.domain.com* as per the theme they are running.
At the moment I am redirecting after figuring out which one needs to be
used, but I would like to do it on the same page.

Any ideas how that can be achieved?

Thanks & Regards

It's hard to give an exact answer without more detials but you can 
output information from another page by calling switch_to_blog() before 
you would send out the information.  So you call switch_to_blog(),  
render the content, and then make sure you switch back at the current 
blog when you are done by calling restore_current_blog();

Leaving a blog switched, can cause very strange behavior.

<!-- Wordpress Counter -->

Unlike before where a dummy iframe was just appended, this one ensures that
the logged in administrator cannot actually encounter the malware code. The
attacker even called it "WordPress Counter" in the comment.

@Dan,
A lot of these options could work, but they reduce risk by limiting
contributions. Why not open the SVN repo up but add an extra layer of
testing on your end? Then you could facilitate contributions & upgrades, but
still confirm if upgrades would be safe.

Automated testing isn't common for WP plugins, but you should be able to
implement a few tests specifically to confirm your transactions will keep
working.

BTW Dan, I've used your JSON API plugin twice on sites. Great system, thank
you.

I meant to display the content as it is with that site's theme, not just the
content.
Obviously I can pick up data directly but its the page output I am talking
about.
Theme, widgets, styles, scripts everything.

Thanks Mike, I appreciate all the positive feedback with the plugin! And I agree that there's a kind of chilling effect introduced by more adding complexity to code submissions.

Broadening the coverage of my tests is always a good idea, and introducing specific cases I personally depend on is an especially good idea. Security-wise I'm starting to think that the risk is actually not very substantial since I'm the only one hitting the upgrade button on my WP installs. I'm going to stick with Subversion and adopt a Reagan-style "trust but verify" motto.

Subject: [wp-hackers] CPT meta box error messages
Message-ID: <FC161F54-8421-47B9-B7C1-7DF208FB40CE@gmail.com>

Hello

I am trying to figure out how to display a validation error on the input (or lack of) from a meta box in a custom post type. 

Values from a meta box on my CPT are used to query an external API which sends back it's own error messages. The meta box values are being saved via the save_post action. Obviously I can't just echo out a message div there because of the redirect. 

I'm fine with the post being saved regardless of the meta inputs. 

I have looked in to the WP_error class but couldnt figure it out. I've also had a look at transients but that seems just as bad as storing an option as what if two users on the same site submit a post one after another? It's possible the second user will get the error of the first. 

Should I do a redirect with a "message" $_GET variable?? :-/

Am I missing something glaringly obvious? There seems to be little support for custom error messages generated from a meta box value on a CPT. 

Thank you!

Andy

If I understand correctly what you are after, you can use the
post_updated_messages filter, so after the post is saved you replace the
usual "Post updated. View post" message with your own custom one:

    add_filter( 'post_updated_messages', 'my_updated_messages' );

    function my_updated_messages( $messages ) {

        global $post, $post_ID;

        if ( 'your_cpt_here' == $post->post_type ) {

            $meta = get_post_meta( $post_ID, 'your_postmeta_name_here', true
);

            if ( '' == $meta ) // or whatever
                $messages[$post->post_type][1] = "Post updated, but you
haven't entered a value for blah. Please enter one and update the post.";
                $messages[$post->post_type][6] = "Post published, but you
haven't entered a value for blah. Please enter one and update the post.";
            }

        }

        return $messages;

    }

You can see the various elements of the $messages array in
edit-form-advanced.php

By removing the "View post" link, it is clear to the author they have to do
something else before they view the post on the site. I also add a class to
the message that adds a little warning sign icon for extra clarity.

Hope that helps
Simon

If you have a scheduled custom post,  updating it via Quick Edit fails (with
no error).

Editing via the edit page still works.

Has anyone else run across this?

Does anyone know off hand where the quick edit update code lives?

You mean redirecting your URLs?  Depends on the pattern you're moving 
from and to. Generally you can do this with .htaccess redirects and some 
clever regex.

Step 1: Just try it as is and see what happens. WordPress's canonical
redirection is pretty darned clever in some ways, and it often can
guess the right thing to serve out of the box.

Step 2: If the built in canonical redirection isn't able to detect and
redirect accordingly, then you can add your own code to discover and
handle the redirections. The way you do this is with the
redirect_canonical filter.

add_filter('redirect_canonical','my_redirects',10,2);

function my_redirects($redirect_url, $requested_url) {
  // do stuff
  return $redirect_url;
}

The function gets the $requested_url, which is what the person asked
for, and it returns the $redirect_url, which is what WordPress thinks
it should serve.

If the $redirect_url is false, then WP will not redirect and will go
to 404 instead. But if the $redirect_url is a normal URL string, then
it will issue a 301 redirect to that string. So if you change that
$redirect_url before returning it, you can make it redirect elsewhere.

So if you can write some code to do the mapping from the old URL to
the new ones, you can make a plugin that has that mapping and then
hook it in using this filter. Voila, instant 301 handling.

If you're using nginx (many large web sites do) then there's a really
fast way to accomplish the redirect in the web server. Use map (
http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpMapModule ).

Example:

map $uri $new {
	/ab/product-32/		/product/billy/;
	/ab/product-33/		/product/ivar/;
	/ab/product-34/		/product/nicklas/;
	/ab/product-35/		/product/sommar/;
}
server {
 ? ?listen 1.2.3.4:80;
 ? ?server_name hostname.com;
	root ? ? ? ?/var/www/wp;
	location /ab/ {
		rewrite ^ $new permanent;
	}
}

Sam,
I'm new to the WordPress project myself, but managed to squeeze a few
patches in before the 3.3 cutoff.

The WP Trac statuses seem to be managed by consensus, so patches may need
review before the status is updated. Also any tasks slated for the upcoming
release are typically assigned or at least actively managed by the core
team. So tasks listed as needing patches but having patches attached
sometimes are just waiting on those people to review them.

What's the timeline for your class project? If it's longer than a few weeks
you can pick a feature request task. If it's shorter then the timing of 3.3
hitting beta means many tasks to be included with this rev are near-done or
going to get punter to the next release. ...which means you'll need to
figure if your class just wants you to contribute, or if you actually need
to get code included in a release.

Another valid option is to write a plugin or theme for WP. These are all
tied to WP and thus GPLed too. They're also a part of the WordPress
ecosystem and essential to make the core successful. Plus, you can control
the timeline and size of these better than core tasks too. If your class
requires you to do something collaborative you could always start one of
these and then ask this hacker's list for someone with time to
co-contribute.

hello

I spent all last night reading codex and tutorials but i still don't
understand how to do this.

I run online shop on wordpress and now i want to create affiliate
program. I will tell to affiliate partners that if someone of them
want to publish referral link on their website, then they have to take
any link from my shops' website and add /partner/1234 at the and,
where '1234' is id of partner

OK, but how to manage this in wordpress? How to register this rewrite
rule that 'any webpage which has "/partner/(.*?)" at end should be
redirected to  version without this (or even it can stay) and to
query_vars[] will be added 'partner''?

"Any" means that partner can publish somewhere links like:
example.com/partner/1234
example.com/blog/hello-world/partner/1234
example.com/archive/january/partner/1234
example.com/static-page/partner/1234

and any other variations which i cant even imagine right now :)

I think what you need is a nice illustration of custom endpoints
See http://codex.wordpress.org/Rewrite_API/add_rewrite_endpoint

That would be something like:

// Add the endpoint rewrite rules
add_filter( 'init', 'ozh_ep_add_rules' );
function ozh_ep_add_rules() {
    add_rewrite_endpoint( 'partner', EP_ALL ); // add endpoint on all 
pages
}

// Add permalink structure and flush on plugin activation
register_activation_hook( __FILE__, 'ozh_ep_activate' );
function ozh_ep_activate() {
    ozh_ep_add_rules();
    flush_rewrite_rules();
}

// Handle the partner id early
add_filter( 'template_redirect', 'ozh_ep_template_redirect' );
function ozh_ep_template_redirect() {
    $partner = get_query_var( 'partner' );
    // do something with $partner
    // ...
}

thank you :) it looks like something what i need :)

and more question: what if i have some plugin which also use
add_rewrite_endpoint to add for example endpoint 'something'?

urls like
example.com/post/hello-world/something/smth-from-plugin/partner/1234
and
example.com/post/hello-world/partner/1234/something/smth-from-plugin

still will work? both of them?

Thanks Mike,

I actually got a couple of smaller patches in this past week myself.

The class is actually self designed so it's pretty open ended.  My hope is
to make a significant contribution of some sort to a collaborative effort,
so a plugin would be less interesting to me.  The class is a semester long
so it ends in December.  What is the timeline for 3.3, is there a place I
can find that in trac?  It doesn't matter much if my contributions don't
come into effect until the next release.  I'll start looking in {32} for now
but if anyone has any ideas, I have a good deal of PHP/CSS/JavaScript
experience so please feel free to send me ideas.

Peace
~Sam

Why not add the query vars via the GET/POST request itself? For example, http://example.com/post/hellow-world/something/?partner=1234.

That would make the partner ID accessible via $_REQUEST['partner'] without impacting the WP query.

Given that the path is used to build the WordPress query, the partner ID has nothing to do with the query, and you can't predict how other plugins will interact with and interpret the path, wouldn't it be "more correct" to exclude non-query-related information from the path? Adding extra data to the path could break another plugin inadvertently.

I recently struggled through this myself while building a theme that supports mobile devices. I wanted to prepend the path with /m/ to signify a mobile device, but it really became far more hassle than it was worth, and I ultimately decided, at least for me, that that was the wrong way to go.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Lowest Capabilities possible in Custom Role?
Message-ID: <4E970966.6020900@gmail.com>

I'm a little confused creating a custom role in a plugin.

I need the end users to do "ONLY" the following things:
-> Post comments
-> Reply to comments
-> Edit their comment (optional/not required).

They *should not* have access to WP-Admin (so I believe I can't give 
them "read" permissions?

What's the correct roles for this kind of user level? I've had a good 
read of the Roles and Capabilities page on the Codex and still can't 
find an exact answer.

Thanks!
Rob

so i understand that when i will use add_rewrite_endpoint to add
endpoint, there will be conflict with plugins which also use this
method?

if yes: is there any other way to append something to url?

why i still dont want to give aup and just add ?partner=1234 at the
end? i want to make it as much easy for affiliate partners as i can.
it is more easy to describe for partners "just put /partner/{your id}
at and of url and thats all" than "put ?partner={your id} at end, if
in url you see already question mark, you should add &partner={your
id}" :)

No, just using the function won't interfere with other plugins, but adding data to the permalink that has nothing to do with the query could potentially mess with other plugins (although, I would think that would be a fringe case).

Actually, I take that back, Konrad. I think the endpoint should work. I guess I was remembering issues with add_rewrite_rule() instead. Sorry.

All users have access to wp-admin to change password, and update their profile.

Johannes,

Can you give more details about the context you're working in? wp_title() can be filtered, and I think it's the best way to manipulate the title, but if it's already been called by the theme, adding a filter there won't do any good. There's also the issue of working with the output buffer. If the head element already exists, it's a little late to be changing its content.

If you don't want them to have *any* access to WP-Admin, then don't give 
them logins, and therefor, they won't need a role. A plugin like AJAX 
Edit Comments can handle the 'edit comments' requirement. Anonymous 
users can comment just fine without a real user login.

If you want verified logins, the Subscriber role should be fine, and 
will have extremely limited access to the admin screens already.

Hello,

I'd like to "NOT" show posts in wp_query class call, if their status is 
set to "private".

This is ...not show them to any users, even logged in / admin users.

Is that possible?

Just make sure that the users you want to prevent from doing this lack the
following capabilities:

delete_private_posts
edit_private_posts
read_private_posts
delete_private_pages
edit_private_pages
read_private_pages

You can also use a plugin like "theme my profile" and allow them to edit
their profiles on the front end, disabling access to the back end
completely. Don't lock admins/editors out!

I just used that on a site today.

Subject: [wp-hackers] 2 domains, 2 sites, 1 WP install
Message-ID: <F5E869E3-198B-4078-8AD3-53A440FE485D@a5d.org>

I'm looking at setting up 2 sites on separate domains but using 1 WP install so that the editors only need to access 1 login/ admin.
The 2 domains will be using the same theme.
The 2 domains will be using the same admin (i'll be building custom pages allowing the addition of the 2 languages (content) on the same page).

I do not need to use any translation plugins as the content will be manually added.

I can just go the WP Network route but prefer not to.

So ... what I need:

2 domains:
domain.com
domain.fr

1 x WP install/ admin login/ theme.

Any suggestions?

TIA

WordPress MultiSite + a domain mapping plugin :)

Works like gangbusters.

I'm looking to not have to go Multisite but, if it's the only, 'proper' way of doing this, then it might just have to be!

Hi,

This might help you, it shares the user table and wp-contents but is still 2 installs.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Post Types in the WordPress Navigation Menu
Message-ID: <4E9B44BA.5060607@gmail.com>

Hello can someone help me out by pointing me in the right direction as 
to where I can find out how to add a drop down menu to a theme with my 
custom post types stored within in, have been looking/searching google 
for "custom post types in wp_nav_menu", "custom post types in 
wp_list_pages", "custom post types in wordpress themes", "custom post 
types in wordpress theme", and have drawn a blank so far, I have managed 
to find out how to get my posts in the custom post types to appear in 
with the normal blog posts, but as I will have several posts in the 
custom post types more than what would be in the normal blog, would make 
this diluted and I would therefore like to have them in a drop down box 
in the menu.

The menu on this website here http://justintadlock.com/ the "Writing" 
part on the menu I presume that these are custom post types, but I wish 
to have the menu on my site like this menu, if anyone can point me in 
the right direction as to how to achieve this, be is something on the 
codex, a blog post or something like this I would very much appreciate 
anything anyone would be able to tell me.

What you are describing is actually the acid test for converting two 
separate sites over to multi-site.  If you need to have a shared 
user-base between multiple sites, then you should be using multi-site. I 
quite often tell people to stick with standard WordPress when they tell 
me "No, the sites don't share authors/admins."

Yeah, you can do stuff to run multiple sites from the same wp install 
without doing the whole multi-site activation, but you're just going to 
be doing it wrong and fewer and fewer people will be using hacks/work 
arounds like the one that was posted.   I would strongly recommend you 
guard your compatibility with future releases by activating MS instead 
of doing fancy footwork with the configuration files.

In the end you all convinced me the MS route was for the best after all.

Thanks for the responses.

	possible) to one Multi Install.
Message-ID: <CAC7r6rUA9ei=fuWNmunAgfkD=39BL1VGNzVzGy+M9j_OgsF89Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have 3 websites that i would like to convert to multi, but i'm
afraid i might encounter some issues/problems, and therefore i'll
state what options i have.

1. I have two dedicated servers (root access) and therefore i am able
to work on one of them without disrupting the websites' online
presence.
2. All the websites are on the same server.
3. All the websites will share its userbase.
4. Some of the plugins will also be shared accros installs.
5. I must state i've never tried to convert before.
6. Currently the websites sit on different accounts but they can be
moved to only one account.

If anyone can suggest an approach or THE best approach as i'm going to
try the conversion, but before i do it, i'd like some advices so i
won't break anything.

Thanks!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Is this a bug? - is_archive()
Message-ID: <4E9C464C.5050108@gmail.com>

I have two seperate custom post types - let's call them 'books' and 'fruit'.

They both have 'has_archive' set to true, and slugs of:
/books/ and /fruit/

In functions.php, I'm calling the following:
if (is_archive('books')) {
     die("true");
}

Which returns true at:
http://www.example.com/books/
[expected behaviour]

It *also* however returns true at:
http://www.example.com/fruit/
[unexpected behaviour when using the post_types parameter]

This is using the latest version of WP.

Am I missing something?

For ref: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_archive

Thanks,
Rob

I believe you should be using is_post_type_archive( $post_type ).

If you look in the code (
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.2.1/wp-includes/query.php )
is_archive() doesn't accept a post type parameter

Good spot - I've cross posted to the 'docs' page to ask someone to
update the codex for that page.

It does incorrectly list post type as a parameter.

Quite off, but which app do you use when coding for WordPress?

I use simple syntax higlighter ones, but I heard about Visual Studio being the best thing on editing code, not sure if works nice with php and css tough. Also, some people recommend CodeBlocks etc

Thanks a lot!

Komodo Edit and Netbeans are probably the best cross-platform 
recommendations afaik.
Both have support for a wide range of programming languages with proper 
xfer/cross reference.
I would go with Komodo simply because it doesn't require setting up 
projects (textmate like, open directory as a project work-flow) and the 
setup is very straight forward (also java free).

For the record, I spend 8+ hours per day coding in Visual Studio for my day
job.  But that's all .Net (C#) development.  For CSS, HTML, XML, JavaScript,
etc I absolutely love it.  It's a lot better than plan old text editors
because of intellisense (termed "intellicrack" by some of my co-workers).
 No guessing what methods/properties your objects have.  Fantastic for
working with .Net code, and it's got great extensions for JS, too.

I actually have jQuery intellisense built right in to the editor.

For PHP code, though, it's a far cry from perfect.  Microsoft hasn't taken
any steps to integrate PHP into the editor, and the third-party tools that *
do* pull in the syntax haven't proven (to me at least) that they're very
mature.  So when I build code for WordPress, I usually switch over to
PhpStorm.

Like VS, PhpStorm gives you intellisense support, but only for the code *in
your project*.  So if you want syntactic suggestions for core WP
functionality, you need to load the entire WP codebase in your project ...
rather than just loading the plugin or theme you're actively developing.
 There might be a workaround or two for this, but I haven't found them yet.

But if you're spending a lot of time working in an IDE, *any IDE*, make sure
you pick one that enables intellisense.  You'll thank yourself later. :-)

Coda + CSSEdit. Been using Espresso 2 a little lately just because it has CSSEdit built into it, but I can't get past how good Coda is with code.

Sorry to correct this statement, but from what you say above it means 
everyone should choose VS just because `intellisense` is what Microsoft 
calls auto-completion or code cross-reference. And that pick should 
definitely be on Windows.

So I suppose Eric wanted to suggest to pick and IDE with good code 
completion. And that *definitely* can be VS or any other editor.

Interesting. It has never even occurred to me not to load entire WP code base into my project, especially since you can have multiple version control repositories represented in a project. 

I agree, I can't even image how constricting it would be not to have intellisense for core WP function when coding. Even worse would be not having the "jump to function" functionality, which I use constantly, to see exactly what a core WP function does (or what any other function does, for that matter.)

Thanks everybody!

I find vim terrible lol Gonna try out the Phpstorm.

Microsoft editors are the best indeed, not sure but... they aren't up to 
develop anything  for php, since they have asp for choose :( too bad. I need 
to use different editors when creating themes and plugins, esp. themes, as 
most editors aren't helpful rendering css sometimes, I try everything for 
save time.

Yes, code completion, also prooject referencing/comments are nice!

Never know it could be done, until complain things to my brother and he 
tells me how programming can be done. He's a C/C++ programmer so is used to 
projects, third part code etc.

TextPad. Windows. Bought it years back. Greatly powerful, but takes
some effort to customize to your workflow. Been using it so long now
that I'm used to its quirks. http://www.textpad.com/

On Linux, vim. It's not the easiest editor in the world to use; it
helps if you can write complex regexp in your head. ;)

You know, when I wrote C and C++, I found Visual Studio indispensable and
incredibly powerful, once you get past the crazy compiling and build
processes.

When I wrote Java, I found Eclipse to be a tool of unparalleled power and
versatility, once you got past the completely insane workflow and project
management issues.

When I write PHP, I need nothing more than a basic text editor with syntax
highlighting and global search capabilities, alongside a web browser open to
php.net because I can never remember whether the damn needle or haystack
argument comes first.

Funny, that.

"I can never remember whether the damn needle or haystack argument

Haha, so I'm not the only one :). Why it changes from function to  
function I have no clue :)

Call me weird, but I'm pretty fond of working in Eclipse for WordPress. It handles the multiple-repository-per-project issue well, and I love the built-in Zend Debugger console. Hard to imagine losing that. Also, I have the jQuery library built in, too, so it's great for Javascript, too. It also helps with the needle/haystack problem. :-)

I also use Compass to compile SASS into CSS, which I've found to be a fantastic time saver.

Quite off, but which app do you use when coding for WordPress?

I use simple syntax higlighter ones, but I heard about Visual Studio being
the best thing on editing code, not sure if works nice with php and css
tough. Also, some people recommend CodeBlocks etc

Thanks a lot!

I was using Coda until we had a training and the trainer brought my thoughts back on NetBeans. I have to say that it is absolutely PERFECT for all my needs. I wrote once on this mailing list how easy it is to set up debugging in NetBeans. It has nice code folding features. It helps me document the code. I can automatically format code to match the WP coding guidelines. 

And it also is the only IDE I know that allows me to separate my wp-content repository from the WordPress core updated through the official svn while still featuring all the code completion goodness as if they were in the same folder. Needless to say it features a great CSS editor and the ability to wonderfully code JavaScript (inkl. native jQuery support). And did I mention the almost perfect SVN integration, the full window editor and how wonderfully stable it is?

It requires a bit more resources than Coda or TextMate, but they are all worth it.

For those that love VIM but miss the power of Netbeans, checkout jVi, a NB
plugin that brings in all the power of VIM. http://jvi.sourceforge.net/

Changed my life, truly.

+1. I do absolutely all of my work in Sublime Text, which offers limited
autocompletion, which I hardly use. The only time I do use it is for
needle-haystack functions, as you mentioned.

The best way to remember needle-haystack order is: array functions use
needle, haystack; string functions use haystack, needle. This is true
(IIRC) for all array/string functions. I usually double-check with
autocompletion though.

If on a  linux box Debian or KDE there is beautiful editor called Geany.
I am using it from last 4 Years now. It comes with intellisense
(auto-completion) for PHP and loads of other plugins. Code highlighting
for many languages is inbuilt. SVN support is also there. Its nothing
less than a IDE

Light weight and superb functionality. Give it a try its available for
windows as well.

I'm jumping through Coda (my favorite one), Sublimetext 2 and PHPStorm - each of them has his advantages and weaknesses ;)

Also use Emacs with this as my profile ~/.emacs to use tabs instead of

Need to say...regex in Microsoft Frontpage do wonders, maybe is due to the 
reference in Help?! I found that some editors can't understand some regex, 
i.e. Notepad++, it never works!

I use Komodo IDE. You can add the WordPress directory as a PHP Directory in the settings and it will be used for autocomplete and calltips. Makes it easy to see available function arguments, class and function documentation, and one click will take you to the file where the function or class is defined. This also works in Komodo Edit, a free open source lightweight alternative to the commercial IDE.

Notepad++ has a few regex plugins that might be useful for you.

Need to say...regex in Microsoft Frontpage do wonders, maybe is due to the
reference in Help?! I found that some editors can't understand some regex,
i.e. Notepad++, it never works!

On the Themes -> Menus page, go to the Screen Options tab at the top. Check
off the box for your custom post type, and you'll see your custom posts on
the main screen along with posts, pages, categories, etc.

Hello Stephanie,

I dont get that I get a tick box for the custom post type, but when I 
tick this it only lets me put in individual posts from that custom post 
type not a link to the custom post type itself, have tried this already.

You can always use the Custom Link function and enter the url to the custom
post type archive. Core doesn't have support for CPT Archives in menu's
(although there's a patch for a future WordPress Release, and a plugin for
it)

Putting it in as a link seems to work correctly, fwiw. Any theme changes based on active menu items kicks in correctly.

I have been using TextMate for quite some time with css, html, jQuery and Wordpress bundle.  These tab triggered snippets in all of the above make dropping in code quick and easy.

I use PHPStorm.  It has good code completion, code refactoring and debugging
tools.  I set up the wp folder as the root for my PHPStorm project and all
the core functions are recognized.

On a side note, I use Git and GitHub for my team of four programmers.  I set
each plugin folder as a Git repository and it's very easy to share code.  I
also put my entire WordPress installation in a Dropbox folder, so I can
seamlessly switch from programming in the office to programming on my home
computer.

Sorry to digress into such details, but I wish someone had given me this
information when I started working with WordPress.

Is there an easy way to turn off mobile commenting on WordPress? I want to keep commenting turned on for all other visitors but disable it for those on mobile devices. Any thoughts?

A hard way to do this would be using media queries for hide the #id of the
comment section, that would work.

I think you could use the is_iphone() conditional wrapped around the comment
form. I've never used it before, but here's some more info on it:

Thanks Bill, I'd assumed is_iphone was just good for iphone, but it looks like it'll catch most mobile devices. Chris

I used this to load a iPad specific navbar, might be useful/ adaptable:

 <script type="text/javascript">
if((navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i))) {
document.write("<?php get_template_part('navpad'); ?>");
} else { 
document.write();
}
</script>

Message-ID: <CAK3PZGs=8Cdr+471F0fkK8fxBg2gQiL0poaeqZBELzyTHABGqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a custom post type set up, with the following permalink structure: *
example.com/people/my-post*
I also have two pages, one with the permalink *example.com/people* and a
child page at *example.com/people/new*

I'm trying desperately to create a custom template for the child page, but
when I visit the page, I receive a 404 error.

Clearly this is due to a rewrite mixup between the custom post type, and the
page.

How do I manage this do you think?

If you explicitly know the page URLs then you can override the rewrite
rules for those particular pages. Here's what I use:

Thanks John,

This works for me, but with some errors. (I am running in debug mode though)

If i use this:
'foo/bar/?$'   => 'index.php?pagename=foo/bar'

I am given the following errors:
Notice: Undefined index: 0
in /Users/hempsworth/Sites/localhost/wp-trunk/wp-includes/post.php on
line 3175
Notice: Trying to get property of non-object
in /Users/hempsworth/Sites/localhost/wp-trunk/wp-includes/post.php on
line 3171
Notice: Trying to get property of non-object
in /Users/hempsworth/Sites/localhost/wp-trunk/wp-includes/post.php on
line 3178

And then the content that's expected.

If I replace that line for this:
'foo/bar/?$'   => 'index.php?page_id=13'

It works fine. Any idea why I'm getting those debug messages?

Ah right, no problem. I'm still working on the site so I'll just wait until
3.3 ships (or trunk gets fixed) to start using the slug rather than the ID.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom HTML Tags in Comment Form
Message-ID: <4EA02E1B.6040806@gmail.com>

How do you define custom HTML tags for users use in a comment form?

If you define CUSTOM_TAGS as true, then WordPress does't declare the 
following globals:
$allowedposttags
$allowedtags
$allowedentitynames

I'm only interested in comment tags ($allowedtags).

Do I *really* have to 'redeclare' all of the three above globals?

What if core updates $allowedposttags in the future ....

How do you solve this?

Also - all documentation on define CUSTOM_TAGS in the codex is incorect. 
You can't define it on INIT, as by that point it's already defined 
within kses.php. Looks like a bug perhaps.

Also - "unsetting" on 'init' doesn't solve the issue.
unset($allowedtags['strong']);

It removes it from the 'allowed_tags()' function which outputs the HTML 
list in the template, however still allows the user to post a comment 
containing those tags.

You mean aside from calling comment_form() in your theme? (see: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/comment_form)  You can customize a ton of stuff (though certainly not everything) through the various args and hooks, which are pretty well documented in the codex.

If you're really trying to do everything from scratch (which is actually quite a bit), you could always just skip the comment_form() function in favor of my_comment_form(), but that would have to be part of a theme, not a plug in.

If at all possible, I'd try hard to work within the existing API.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Enhancements to Settings API
Message-ID: <CALS5SwcFJgE4LewvuGtGG1hO=aJE+8U2nBGLvbFa6zKT+jsLUA@mail.gmail.com>

*Enhancements to Settings API*

I am thinking of proposing some relatively minor changes to the Settings
API, but thought I would bounce around some ideas here first before
submitting a patch.

One of the aspects I find limiting about the Settings API is the fixed
nature of the XHTML markup generated by the do_settings_sections() function.
By way of a reminder, this function iterates over a global variable (array)
which holds the settings sections registered for that particular settings
page, and then outputs the following markup and content for each registered
section:


- h3 title of the section

- Output of the callback specified in add_settings_section() (if specified)

- table opening markup
- a table row for each registered settings field applicable to this settings
section, containing markup for each setting's form field
- a table row.. ditto
- etc
- table closing markup

This block is then repeated for the next registered settings section, and so
on, until do_settings_sections() has finished its output.

The problem with this situation is that this markup is not ideal if one
needs a more complex markup to create, for example, a tabbed interface like
that found in the existing Appearance>Themes page. Although it is possible
to use jQuery to create the necessary markup, it's rather complicated and
far from ideal.

So, here are possible solutions (in no particular order):

1. Add a filter within the foreach loop in do_settings_sections(). The
filter would need to pass the $section array.

2. Create a new function do_settings_section($page, $section) to allow
output of each section separately.

3. Add a new $section parameter to the existing do_settings_sections()
function, ie like this: do_settings_sections($page, $section = false).
if $section is false, then the function spews everything out just like now.
If $section has a value of the id of a registered section, then only that
section will be output.

Disadvantages of #1 is that dealing with the closing markup becomes
complicated, unless the user uses the filter to completely replace the
existing code within the foreach loop.
Disadvantages of #2 is that it basically replicates an existing function,
which doesn't feel right, and would require, say, 5 function calls in order
to output 5 settings sections...

For me, #3 seems the least worst option and would maintain backwards
compatibility.

Any thoughts, anyone?

If I haven't been very clear in what I'm discussing, please let me know and
I'll try to elaborate! :-)

As mentioned before, I could have raised a ticket already, but wanted to get
some other input before I do so.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <CAMg3evGcjgTwWXLTz76QEM13i1h1rn831C6gnzdmbmEwA49+Xg@mail.gmail.com>

I suspect this a "can't see the the forest through the trees" situation but
I've been looking at this off and on for a couple days and am not sure what
I am doing wrong.  I am working on a site for my daughter's soccer team and
have defined a custom post type for the roster called "player".  I can add
players and all of the information I've defined for each without any issue.
 However, when I want to display the information on a page (e.g. the roster
page), I am not getting what I expect and I am not sure why.  I've defined a
short code that can appear on a post or page that will do nothing more than
build a table that contains the roster - player names, jersey number,
position, etc.

My short code does this:

    // Query players from the database.
    $loop = new WP_Query(
        array(
            'post_type' => 'player',
            'order_by' => 'title',
            'order' => 'ASC',
            'posts_per_page' => -1,
        )
    ) ;
    var_dump($loop->query) ;

When I loop through the posts I notice a couple things:

   1. The custom posts are not ordered based on the title, they are ordered
   by post id.
   2. The query results include the post id for the page I have the short
   code embedded on (this one really stumps me).

I added another query argument ('post__not_in' => array(get_the_ID())) to
see if I could eliminate the page's post id but that didn't work either.  As
I noted above, I suspect I am doing something very basic incorrectly but I
can't see it so any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Mike

I think we're talking about the $is_iphone global variable, not a
conditional function (Bill's post is perhaps slightly misleading), are we
not?

AFAIK, this variable is only true if a mobile Safari version is detected.

I get what you're saying, but the fixed nature of the markup is sorta
the whole point of the API in the first place. It's to provide a
consistent look and feel across all the settings pages. If you want to
do customized markup for a settings page, then using the Settings API
at all in pretty much unnecessary.

Also, something like markup for the tabs and such would likely be
better implemented outside the do_settings_sections call, in the
callback that you pass to the add_*_page. In there, you could do
something like output the Tab markup, then make a separate
do_settings_sections call for each tab, wrapping its output in the
appropriate markup for your jQuery tab interface.

Basically, instead of adding a $section parameter to
do_settings_sections(), just make more than one set of sections,
perhaps using a prefix for their names.

First, I would recommend following/contributing to Trac Ticket
#18285<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18285>for Settings
API-related changes.

Second, IMHO, settings that use markup other than that ascribed by core are
Doing It Wrong. Reasonable minds will disagree, but I believe that
Themes/Plugins should be emulating core UI as much as possible. The beauty
of the Settings API is that it allows developers to focus on the
functionality, rather than on the settings-page markup. As Ticket #18285
gets implemented, that focus will be made even more clear.

I knew it would be something simple - thanks!  That fixes the ordering
problem.  Still not clear why the query returns the post of the page I am
building but at least the ordering is correct now.

It turns out the post id for the page wasn't being returned by my query - I
was looking at the value of get_the_ID() before actually calling
$loop->the_post() which explains why I was seeing the post id of the page.
 I'll tuck my tail and head back to working on my plugin ...

I am trying to use the direct embed of a mailchimp form on my website.
The reason for not using either of the two mailchimp plugins that are
available is I need to include hidden fields in the form.

When I embed the code (using html tab or super simple shortcode) the
form does not work as expected.

I figured maybe there was a javascript conflict.

Did a search found an article by Chris Coyier.
http://digwp.com/2009/06/including-jquery-in-wordpress-the-right-way/

In the article he made the recommendation to put a
wp_enqueue_script("jquery") before wp_head

<?php wp_enqueue_script("jquery"); ?>
<?php wp_head(); ?>

Thing is this was over 2 years ago. Seems like TwentyTen and other
themes would be either following something like this. Or, more likely,
the wp core has been modified to handle these issues.

What is the best practice for loading jquery files?

I would say read the Codex that is what it is for

Claude,

jQuery is not (and should not be) loaded at every page load. At best, loading it when it's not needed would delay uncached page loads. Some themes do make use of it, and they will no doubt include it, but unless core evolves to do something fancy enough to actually require jQuery (doubtful), you won't see it there.

So, adding <?php wp_enqueue_script( 'jquery'); ?> to your header.php _before_ <?php wp_head(); ?> is called will indeed load jQuery. It should be noted, though, that WordPress loads jQuery in no-conflict mode, meaning it must be called via jQuery() and not the shorthand $().

Cheers.

Thanks,

It makes sense now.
The post I was reading involved a specialized theme that did use
jquery  in its menus.

I'll let the plugins load it if they need it.

Seems like a good move for the core to load in no-conflict.

Thanks again,
Claude

Message-ID: <CAJeFiEY-=263LKjzUseHX7esokzFO=ZD2Tquf7+6enbe=5wRcg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I do not know how to map file path to url in PHP/WordPress.

Suppose my css sheet is in path

/var/www/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/my-plugin/mystyle.css.

And suppose my domain is domain.com.

How can I map the path

/var/www/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/my-plugin/mystyle.css

to

http://domain.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/my-plugin/mystyle.css

Any useful functions and Wordpress API will be appreciated

If you're referring to the file from within a plugin, you'd use something
such as:
echo plugins_url('mystyle.css', __FILE__); (The __FILE__ part makes it refer
to mystyle.css relative to the current file)

If you were refering to a themes file, you'd use something such as:
echo get_template_directory_uri() . '/some-style-file.css';

Thanks very much, Dion. This is what I want.

But now I have problem with registering the style sheet.
I did as the Wordpress function references suggest.
<code>

*add_action*
('wp_print_styles','add_pll_style_sheet');

function *add_pll_style_sheet*(){
    $screen_filepath = WP_PLUGIN_DIR.'/'.'css/screen.css';
    if(file_exists($screen_filepath)){

        wp_register_style("blueprint_screen",plugins_url('css/screen.css',
__FILE__));
        wp_enqueue_style('blueprint_screen');
    }
}

</code>
The *add_pll_style_sheet*() won't execute at all! (I tested it  adding a *
die*() in the front, but nothing happens)
And I don't think  the action *wp_print_styles *is wrong, because I did as
the wordpress reference suggests.

And the context is correct, I think.Because other functions(hooks) are
executed smoothly, except this one.

Any idea?

If you inserted the die() within the if(file_exists() check, that'll be why,
as that filepath is wrong, WP_PLUGIN_DIR refers to the plugins folder, not
the plugins folder.

The better way would be to write that as
  $screen_filepath = dirname(__FILE__) . '/css/screen.css';
if you really want to check for it's existence first.

other than that, it looks fine to me from what I know of it.

I inserted the die() in the VERY front.
It look fine to me as well.
Thanks anyway. :-)

I agree with that, but I don't think the API should preclude allowing
deviations altogether. I think it comes down to extensibility - keeping
default behaviour which 100% fits in to the WP way, but allowing
customisation when required. In the particular use case I'm working with,
which requires tabs in order to make a reasonable user experience for the
settings page, I am effectively blocked from using the full Settings API -
which I think is a shame. (Having said that, I need to think through the
suggestion in Otto's reply.)

Anyway, I'll check that ticket and see which way the wind is blowing on this
subject.

Cheers.

Creating tabbed Theme settings pages, using the Settings API? Funny you
should mention that. :)
http://www.chipbennett.net/2011/02/17/incorporating-the-settings-api-in-wordpress-themes/

I've actually polished up the approach considerably since then, including
dynamic output of the form-field markup, dynamic calls to
add_settings_section() and add_settings_field(), and dynamic validation
based on data type. See Oenology for example code:
https://github.com/chipbennett/oenology/blob/master/functions/options-register.php

(Note that, I even include an example of a Theme setting ("varietals", or
"skins") that requires custom markup/validation.)

Message-ID: <CAJbdpGtROVSjxZX8k2kHZLG_5dvxEY9iEOPrDOm7DF+mE_s53Q@mail.gmail.com>

I am puzzling over a support request I received from a user of my Facebook
Tab Manager plugin, which uses a custom post type for posts intended for
display as Facebook page tabs. For some reason, when she goes to the post
listing in the editor, she sees a count for the number of drafts and the
number of published posts she has created, but the posts themselves are not
listed. It's working fine for other people, so not sure what the glitch
would be in her installation. Could be a bug in my plugin that only shows up
in certain configurations.

http://www.carrcommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FB_Tab_Manager_pic2.jpg

Wondering if anyone else has seen something like this and how they solved
it.

User is running WP 3.1 and for some reason doesn't want to upgrade. But I
don't think my plugin relies on anything that's specific to a more recent
version.

I'm trying out the multisite feature sometime and found great that themes 
and plugins must be activate within the admin network panel.

Is there anyway to activate plugins/theme for some subsites only, i.e. 
especific plugins/themes for every subsite?! Is quite useless to let subsite 
use plugins not related to their content, isn't?

Thanks

Plugins don't have to be network activated; they can be activated for an
individual site in that site's Dashboard.

Themes are not activated in the network admin, but rather enabled *for use*
by the network or a site. You can enable a theme for a single site by
editing it in the network admin. Actually activating a theme is also done in
that site's Dashboard.

Message-ID: <4EA341E4.9020906@gmail.com>

Hello,

Could someone point me in the right direction in how to make 
day/month/year archives for custom post types.

Normal blog posts get there archives like 
http://www.domain.co.uk/2010/12 but can I do something similar for 
custom post types, I was thinking/hoping something like this would work 
http://www.domain.co.uk/lotto/2010/12 or 
http://www.domain.co.uk/lotto/2010 but these do not work.

I have has_archive set to true, and this does load the 
archive-{post-type}.php file, but I cant get the year/month/day archive 
to work, it just seems to load this page as is, and doesn't seem to know 
its an archive page.

Thank you.
Daniel.

There ARE plugins that can let you activate other plugins per-site. Depending on which way you want to go, these have been helpful:

* http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exclude-plugins/
* http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/restrict-multisite-plugins/

I'm having trouble with figuring out how to keep the array of image

I'm trying to adapt a couple of Javascript files to

I've got a script to enlarge the image but having trouble getting
previous and next button working
You can see it at http://ghiglione.ca/xml2/
What I'd like to do is imitate the wordpress idea of excerpts and
enable the description to show in full on the expanded popup

I can zip the files if anyone is interested.
Feedback would be appreciated.

Daniel,

WordPress doesn't, by default, support pretty permalinks for date-based
post-type archives. You can append query strings to the CPT archive URL and
accomplish what you're looking to do, but if you want nice permalinks, you
need to manually add the rewrite rules.

I added an example at http://pastebin.com/80UEbXs8 that creates the
necessary rules. I pulled this from a project that had many custom post
types, hence the foreach loop. As the function name implies, this code is
tied to the *generate_rewrite_rules* action. Also, to avoid conflicts with
post names, etc., the URLs include a *date* slug between the post type slug
and the date pieces of the URL. This may or may not be needed for your
project, and removing line 14 from the example will eliminate the
*date* element
from the URLs if you don't want/need it.

strange  :

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ourstatsde-widget/stats/

Constant download rate between 2000 or 3000 per day, and no weekend/

Never seen this at any other plugin...

Thanks Mika, that seems useful. I found that if I intall some plugins for a 
specific subject, the plugin will be vivible fo other subsites too.

Yeah, that's by design :) Plugins are there for all sites, so if you want, say, only ONE site to have a plugin, you need to use one of the other plugins I listed to restrict it.

It's different from themes and bakes a lot of people's brains ;)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Better approach for post formats
Message-ID: <CAPnRZcRfzk2kgOOGLR9Q8t-akyFqnMG3wmDa8XgQ30FMGD1Pww@mail.gmail.com>

Hello. I have talked about this elsewhere, yet I believe I can get
more feedback here :)

There have been much buzz about the post format feature added in
WordPress 3.1, which I like conceptually, yet it disappoints me
because seems like its like a step backwards regarding the existing
API. Basically is something that perfectly could have been done with
an standardized taxonomy term and the way the format is delivered
seems somewhat primitive since the admin post UI remains intact and
the theme have to do calculations of how to interpret the content,
much like the Posterous approach and making the selection of a
"format" somewhat trivial. This don't feel much different from the
current "links" feature that look outdated as it uses specific PHP
tags, but by now could be converted into an ordinary custom post type
(subject for another thread). Could have been enough if using radio
buttons for taxonomies was in the API by default, and even useful for
a lot of other taxonomy usages.

However, this could have been not too problematic if at least there
were a convention of how to use the standard fields for the different
content types, yet there's no clear way to do it and each theme is
taking different approaches to do it, which is very ironic since the
very reason of having a fixed and not extensible list of post formats
is to create more interoperability between themes, yet is much likely
the way many current blogs with post formats can became broken when
switching themes. Some use custom fields, and some don't, for example.
Although I don't believe that there's a need for infinite kinds of
"formats", I still believe that there other valid formats that could
be added to the convention (again, subject for another thread).

The whole idea was clearly inspired by Tumblr. Hence, I think that by
justifying the adding of new PHP tags for post formats should be
something like actually changing the post UI by hiding or showing the
relevant fields required for each kind of format, such as showing
different metaboxes for quote (one for the actual quote, other for the
credit), for status (hiding the title one), for video (one metabox for
the raw code or oEmbed link and the other for custom text) and the
like. It may probably look better as a tab at the top of the post
panel. The Tumblr template "API" can give you some ideas

I proposed this in WordPress ideas based on some post of Matt in the
Dev blog and, despite the support, it was marked as a theme issue :(

That is now removed for abusing the directory.
It might be back if the explanatiuon is innocent enough.

The original idea for post formats wasn't even code, it was just going
to be a codex page about a post format taxonomy.

It's unlikely that core will be tackling a UI shifting pattern for
post formats for at least another couple of versions, simply because
themes *are* doing it differently and no common standard has emerged
yet. Until there's a common and accepted pattern, anything core does
would just be disagreed with by most theme authors.

Even your own ideas of what fields to use are non-standard. Many
people only put "status" in the title field. I see that a fair amount,
actually, and have had to make plugin changes to accommodate people
who do that.

Themes don't have to support post formats, and most don't support but
a few of them. This is why it's optional and granular.

It *is* a theme issue. Theme authors have to come together and decide
on standards too. Core can't impose them all the time.

Hi Erick,

Thanks very much for the code, looks just what I am after as I have 8 
custom post types, and so I have used the code as is.

But for some odd reason I cant get my head round as to why the line with 
"get_post_types( false )" on it doesn't return my custom post types that 
I have registered.

I have pasted the code for one of my custom post types here 
http://pastebin.com/YsHtYSiP have I done something not entirely correct 
in this code, I installed the custom-post-type-ui plugin when I create a 
custom post type with this and choose the same options the code 
"get_post_types( false )" does return my custom post type.

Thank you
Daniel.

I actually wish core *would* impose at least *some* Post-Format
implementation conventions - primarily regarding Post *data* entry.
Imposition (or, more accurately, simply *definition*) of such conventions
would actually *help* facilitate more widespread use/support of Post Formats
by Theme developers.

Though, I understand completely the reasoning. As you noted: Post Formats
really are simply a custom taxonomy, wrapped with some dedicated template
tags. But, I think they've been around long enough - and have seen
widespread-enough adoption - for a data-entry convention to be defined.

Daniel,

That is a reference to a method in the class I lifted the code from. I
should have removed it before I put the code on PasteBin. You should replace
that with an array of the post types you wish to add date-based archives to.
I updated the code and added a note regarding the array for that loop.

Erick,

I see ok but the strange thing is the code used as is, worked perfectly 
well when I was using the custom-post-type-ui plugin, but when I am 
using the register_post_type function to register my post types they 
appear in wordpress, but none of the code below returns any information 
about my custom post types, it just returns an empty array.

var_dump( get_post_types( false ) );
var_dump( get_post_types( array( 'public' => true, '_builtin' => false 
), 'names' ) );
var_dump( get_post_types( array( 'public' => true, '_builtin' => false 
), 'objects' ) );

I have the same issue as this person here 
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18950 but I have tried the code 
submitted by Big Bagel, see below and this doesn't work either, the 
above functions still dont return anything for there custom post type.

$args =>  array(
     'public' =>  true,
     'publicly_queriable' =>  true,
     'show_ui' =>  true,
     'show_in_nav_menus' =>  true,
     'exclude_from_search =>  false
);
register_post_type( 'my_custom_post_type', $args );

Thank you
Daniel.

Erick,

I have tried doing what you said have put in 1 of my custom post types 
in the array, and it still doesn't work when I am registering my custom 
post type myself with the register_post_type function in my themes 
functions.php file.  See here for the code I am using to setup my custom 
post types http://pastebin.com/YsHtYSiP

The output from get_post_types is still an empty array, the only time 
the array returns anything is when the custom post type has been created 
by the custom-post-type-ui plugin not with the above code.

Here is a copy of my code that is your code you posted earlier with the 
suggested changes to it http://pastebin.com/QBWnTa77

If anyone is able to shine some light on whats going on with the code 
that registers my custom post type, I would be extremely grateful!

Thank you
Daniel.

I'm aware of that. That was the whole problem I tried to expose :)

I somewhat believe that only a single additional standard text field
is needed to standardize everything, thought. The excerpt may do but
it's like an overload.

I posted my complain to WordPress ideas when 3.1 was not even launched
and everything was still draft. That summed by the fact the thing is
both "not extensible" by the user and developers have other priorities
makes it feel like a crummy artifact that it's hard to ignore. I
always hope more dedication to fix bugs and make everything more
framework-like instead of releasing new little incomplete features
that, besides all the buzz, don't blend with the rest. :(

So we now simply got it in core, which means that it's pretty unlikely to 
see post formats ever disappear - no matter if they are used or not. After 
reading this [1] (was this the initial ticket?), I still don't understand 
how and where "post formats" made its way into core (I guess IRC?).

Anyway: What I don't understand is why there's absolutely no recommendation 
in the related Codex page. I'd have expected to see some example 
implementation that recommends what to put where (example: "don't use custom 
fields - extract stuff from content/excerpt" or "use custom fields - name 
them exactly like the post format", etc.), to make it easier for a) 
developers to have a discussion base and b) for users what to expect. 
Haven't we got Theme development guidelines [3] for a reason? Example: Why 
are developers forced by a) core and b) the guidelines to use a comments.php 
file, but are left without any hint on how to implement post formats? I 
absolutely agree with @Andr?s Sanhueza "(...) yet is much likely the way 
many current blogs with post formats can became broken when switching 
themes".

I really hope that those who pushed for post formats and implemented them 
will step in and start the discussion. If not, I hope automattic will step 
in and tries to bring theme devs on a table to get a "standard" 
implementation recommendation on the table.

Thanks.

Ah the joys of an open-source project. Adding new features like Formats is pretty much par for the course in open-source/community projects. Several developers have similar wants that more or less align around Formats, so the feature gets added. Then it takes a version or two to pound out the details of what people really want to see. If you look at the history of the Internet, you'll see that's exactly how it evolves (consider the histories of HTML, CSS and JavaScript), so it's hard to throw stones here.

Also, the Twenty Eleven theme is typically used as an example of how developers can employ new features, and post formats are no exception. IMHO, the clear usage is varied CSS formatting on the front end, not different input fields on the backend. Formats are the same content fields formatted differently. If what you're looking for is totally different fields, you may want to consider different post types instead--that's where the complete customization lies. Again, IMHO, I actually think the UI is much friendlier if very different content is published via different sub-panels (e.g. a "status update" is one sub-panel and a "post" is another), which is accomplished through post types, not formats.

You should have any problems at all, Rob.

Dan York has a WordPress site that he moved to a support IPv6. According to his post on the matter, the problem was only finding the hosting. WordPress itself had no problems whatsosever.

Daniel,

If you only want to add the rules for certain post types, you don't need to
use the *get_post_types* function. If you remove that and leave the inner
array as shown in your code, it should work.

The only part that WordPress cares about IPv6 would be comments IP Addresses
logging, and that was fixed 4 years ago:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/6658 (There's another changeset
around that date for the Database field length i believe).

It does look like there's an open issue however, MultiSite when using a IPv6
address directly (rather than a domain name) seems to have some bad
sanitization for the port numbers:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15936 - But that shouldn't affect most
peoples uses!

Also, just to be thorough, a small number of plugins and themes may have issues with IPv6 if they store or manipulate IP addresses. But for those you'll probably won't know until one of them fails on IPv6. 

Realistically though I doubt any you'd need will have such issues. FWIW.

Erick,

Have tried both the get_post_types function and this returns an empty array
if I specify my own array the code then loops the array but the
get_post_type_object function is then empty does not return anything.

Daniel,

If you only want to add the rules for certain post types, you don't need to
use the *get_post_types* function. If you remove that and leave the inner
array as shown in your code, it should work.

My New York City client is looking for a WordPress Developer who can help
out with the general maintenance of a WP Site.

This is not a full-time job, but rather they have a list of items that
currently needs to be worked on, and then there will be the general
maintenance that they will need on an ad-hoc basis.

Please be around NY so we can meet and chat about the site (we're located in
midtown) - though the work will be done remotely.

Please reply with resume and hourly rate. 

Thank you,

 I also have another 1-2 month WP/PHP/Rails gig in NYC so if you're from the
NY/NJ/CT area, I've got good-paying work for you.  I need resumes and hourly
rates.

There's a add_settings_error function that's part of the Settings API
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_settings_error I
haven't looked into it much, but could be worth checking out.

As almost all the content, will be similar (translations), and all the
code (Core, Plugins, Themes) will be the same, a better route then
MultiSite probably exists.

You can use the requested domain as a switch
(http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#WordPress_address_.28URL.29
to protect for canonical redirection) to pull up the appropriate
version of content. It might be tricky, as the translation has to be
served with CPTs or Custom Meta Boxes, but it should be possible.
Using a single blog makes sense as the content isn't so much
different, just translated. If it's actually different content, use
MultiSite.

Would probably make a really popular plugin if it could be done.

Lee, I don't have your message in my inbox to directly reply to because I just signed up on this list.  So I'm replying to Ken's.  Ken's suggestion won't actually solve the problem for you, it gets you close, and you'll think it's working but there are a number of internal issues you'd run into that would cause you headaches. 

However, it sounds like what you're really after is a root relative url plugin.  I'm 90% complete with publishing one.

Keep an eye on it for next week:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/root-relative-urls/

You'd be able to use just one install and access it from as many domains as you wish.

Thanks,
Marcus

(http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#WordPress_address_.28URL.29
to protect for canonical redirection) to pull up the appropriate version of content. It might be tricky, as the translation has to be served with CPTs or Custom Meta Boxes, but it should be possible.
Using a single blog makes sense as the content isn't so much different, just translated. If it's actually different content, use MultiSite.

Would probably make a really popular plugin if it could be done.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Converting 3 hightraffic websites (no downtime

Since you have two dedicated servers, then the second one can serve as
practice staging. Just set up MultiSite, try importing the 3 blogs,
and see how it goes. If you mess up, try again. :) no harm, no
downtime. When you're ready, move the dns to point at the new server.
Just don't edit/change anything on the original, and you should always
have a safe backup.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Two new,
 long-overdue plugins to make your wordpress life a little easier...
Message-ID: <4C9C70943A019D44B90BF87BB445B2DFDAE2F04F92@RSWMAIL1.dgs.dgsystems.com>

In the past I have lightly managed and tweaked some wordpress installs and as a result I was put on a project at my current company Springbox that was a full site development.  Through the course of that project and then two more I quickly realized two things:


1.       Wordpress is an amazing platform for rapid web development

2.       The use of Absolute URLs, and how poorly the Visual / HTML Editor behaved made it a nightmare to work with as a professional platform.

Blown away by the dozens of posts from Core WP developers that root relative urls are not possible, and after trying to do all of their suggestions to resolve my problem with none of them actually working I almost gave up on the platform entirely.  And the ludicrous concept that in order to prevent your html markup from being corrupted by the visual tab you should just disable the visual tab altogether was almost the nail in the coffin.

Alas, I don't shy away from a challenge and having over 15 years of experience with enterprise web development, and over 5 years of experience with developing my own WYSIWYG editors and extending others like tinyMCE, fckedit I realized these problems were not unsolvable.  So I've spent the last three weeks hacking away at the problem and here's what I have to offer you:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/preserved-html-editor-markup/

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/root-relative-urls/

They are not perfect, and I will spend more time polishing them up.  They do work as advertised, as we have upgraded our past projects to work with them.  And ultimately they seem to be the only solutions to top requests from the community for years, which kind of shocks me.

Combined they actually make wordpress a dream to work with - sure it still has its quirks here and there, but the root-relative-urls plugin even accounts for links and media as they are embedded into the now usable wysiwyg/html editor.

Check them out, let me know what you think.  Ideally I'd re-architect the whole damn components in the WP core, but alas you know how that goes :D  They were sort of sponsored by Springbox - the company I work for - in that I got to use my free time at work to create them, and I put in a few hours a week at night (like tonight) to finish them up.  We don't have a landing page on springbox.com yet, nor do we even have a support infrastructure for handling requests, but I'll do my best to keep up with the questions and the projects.

Being a service-based agency, product development isn't a core strategy so I might be non-responsive at times when workloads are high - clients first of course - but I'm now personally vested in this platform and would like to see it continue to excel.

Wow, congratulations for the attitude and effort, I'll definitely use the
Root Relative Urls plugin, because Im always testing sites on iPhone and you
know the drill.

Yeah that was a huge PITA for us on my second project here at Springbox.  We ended up doing router based NAT translation, but fortunately we had a cisco device that could support it, my home WIFI didn't so any issues I worked on from home were impossible to test.

One day we all dream that the core team might finally see the light.

For WordPress to be a serious enterprise platform - it needs to make 
some serious enterprise changes.

Relative URL's would work for everyone - absolute URLs make things 
difficult for us enterprise lot (discounting that DB data should be kept 
clean - not containing URLs yardy da ... etc).

I have a dream. We can but hope.

Message-ID: <CAK3PZGtN=XtL9b2ZR598xrTS7_QzXRkcSHaxpurWY07J-e+QeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been banging my head against a brick wall trying to get this done, so
hopefully somebody can help.

I have a custom post type at example.com/people/person
I have a custom field stored as the following array:
[0] => array(
    'title' => 'Manager',
    'organisation' => 'Acme Inc.'
),
[1] => array(
    'title' => 'Code Wrangler',
    'organisation' => 'Code Co.'
)

I need to be able to have the following URL filter the results,
example.com/people/?title=Manager, to show all custom post types with the
title 'Manager' in their custom field.

I'm not worried about pretty permalinks for this, just getting it working
would be fine!

Does anybody have any suggestions?

I don't have much love for the visual editor either, but I don't disable it.
If I find that I'm dumping a bunch of code into posts or pages I stop and
realize I am doing it wrong.

Wordpress is all about the templates. Using templates and shortcodes to
include html makes much more sense for the way I use the software. Maybe I'm
being na?ve?

One day we all dream that the core team might finally see the light.

For WordPress to be a serious enterprise platform - it needs to make 
some serious enterprise changes.

Relative URL's would work for everyone - absolute URLs make things 
difficult for us enterprise lot (discounting that DB data should be kept 
clean - not containing URLs yardy da ... etc).

I have a dream. We can but hope.

Some of us use WP to blog about code.  I use the HTML editor when I do that, which is a hassle, but there you are.

Hey Rick, 
I just tried it on a fresh installation of wordpress with the downloaded package from wordpress.org and it worked for me.  Can you look at your error log and send me the warnings / errors that were generated?

Also, if you can send me some info about your setup that would help too. (php version, wp version, os etc)

Thanks,
Marcus

I don't think it's an issue of being na?ve, you've managed to find a work around to an inherent problem in the system.  To say that embedding text (be it textual representations of code, or general words of speech) in the visual editor is "doing it wrong" because wordpress has a deficiency in handling it is all about perspective.  And coming from a different world (outside of the wordpress community) where it's possible to do and easier to do than relying on shortcodes as a fix, the idea of using shortcodes feels wrong to me... for that purpose anyway.

But my main gripe is that when I spend a bunch of effort to markup a post in HTML, it shouldn't be mangled and ripped apart just because I want to preview it in the Visual tab.  And that's what my plugin preserves, it keeps the formatting of your source code in the HTML tab consistent as you wrote it (for the most part) even if you switch tabs, or let others modify it on the visual tab.

In my industry we develop great looking sites for clients who then want to continue adding content.  Sometimes that requires classes on tags, sometimes it requires specific nesting of elements.  We could (and do) develop shortcodes in many cases to make it easier for them.  But our clients are capable people and they often look to the source code of other posts and pages we've written to figure out how to repeat the results elsewhere.  In that case, markup formatting is key to legibility.  With this plugin they can do both, without worrying about the Visual tab literally changing the content in some cases, let alone making the html markup one giant blob of text.

I don't have much love for the visual editor either, but I don't disable it.
If I find that I'm dumping a bunch of code into posts or pages I stop and realize I am doing it wrong.

Wordpress is all about the templates. Using templates and shortcodes to include html makes much more sense for the way I use the software. Maybe I'm being na?ve?

One day we all dream that the core team might finally see the light.

For WordPress to be a serious enterprise platform - it needs to make some serious enterprise changes.

Relative URL's would work for everyone - absolute URLs make things difficult for us enterprise lot (discounting that DB data should be kept clean - not containing URLs yardy da ... etc).

I have a dream. We can but hope.

Use this for the meta query in your main query.

'meta_query' => array(
	'key' => 'position',
	'value' => '%Manager%',
	'compare' => 'LIKE'
)

That *might* work. No guarantees. Also, it's not smart. If the name of
the company is "Manager Systems" you'll get that too.

Realistically, you should separate all this data into separate fields
instead of having them in one big array in a single field.

Not sure what exactly you're trying to do but neither TinyMCE nor 
WordPress have problem in handling pasted code in the visual editor.

This is a misconception: the visual editor is a _text_ editor, not HTML 
IDE thing. It works similarly to MS Word or OO Writer and uses HTML code 
for formatting the text the same way other text editors use xml. If you 
prefer to code the HTML by hand or other means, you shouldn't use it.

I don't know anybody who's said that they're "not possible". However,
we do tend to all say that they're a *bad idea*. Which they are.

Using relative-urls, even root relative ones, makes an inherent
assumption that your content is only viewed on your website itself,
and only in the context of a web browser. This is not necessarily a
correct assumption. Furthermore, by making this assumption, you limit
the scope of your content unnecessarily.

While I'm sure you probably considered the feed-reader case (where
your content is not displayed in the context of your website and so
your URLs may not be handled properly by the reader), you may not have
considered other cases. What happens when your content gets converted
into a book, or print? Having the actual full URL, even in the print,
would be nice to be able to drive traffic back to your site. Things
like that, things you didn't think of for the future, are reasons why
not to use relative URLs.

The only reason to use relative URLs, in fact, is for migration of
content from one domain to another. And realistically, this isn't
something you should be doing often anyway. And by using root-relative
URLs, you limit this case to only migrating content at the same level
to begin with. Domain changing only, basically. So it's kind of
pointless to do.

A fully qualified URL works every time, everywhere. It's easily parsed
by search engines. It works in feed readers. It works no matter where
your content is displayed.

You most certainly *can* use relative URLs. You just *shouldn't*.

Agreed. Rather than try to modify a fairly simple visual editor that does
what it's supposed to do and doesn't try to be too clever; why not make your
plugin add a new option of *replacing* the visual editor with a WYSIWYG HTML
editor.

Please do check out the past discussions on this subject to see why relative
URLs do *not* work for everyone (hint: think about RSS readers where
'relative' is relative to the downloaded XML, or feed aggregators where
relative is relative to the aggregator site).

No, you're missing my point entirely - I'm not using the visual editor as an IDE, and I was trying to correct Preston's impression as well.

I'm simply talking about using the HTML tab to write post markup, then switching to the Visual tab.  When you switch back your HTML markup is reformatted when it doesn't need to be.

That's all my plugin fixes - it keeps it the same way you wrote it.

Possible also means a solution that doesn't break other plugins and is fully
backwards compatible.  None of the solutions proposed that I have seen meet
that threshold.

However what you're saying is only from one perspective. The URLs can be output as non-relative, even if they're stored as relative. The processing cost of this is absolutely minimal, and in most other systems is the way it's implemented (see Joomla, or even using a function such as site_url()).

It *is* a constant problem to have to rewrite the database when moving from dev to staging to prod, even if it's minimal for each site. The various methods to avoid this still are a solution against an non-optimum core issue when it comes to this common use case.

Otto, you are just wrong.  You cannot use root relative urls in wordpress multi-site.

You are certainly presumptuous too, I have considered other medium as well (as has the entire enterprise development community), when you generate a book you prepend the domain to the root relative url in the same way a browser does it, or a proper rss reader does with the channel link element, or the way every search engine does when crawling your site.  This is done once on export of the content, not always from generation.  Unless you do it improperly like print your webpage in the browser which gives you NO LINK URL AT ALL just an underlined series of words - does that mean we should do away with the innerText of anchor elements and only show the fully qualified href?

There are dozens of reasons to use root-relative URLs - here are SOME of them: multiple domain single IP hosting, Multiple country TLDs, accessing content on staging dev & production sites, reverse-proxies, internal v external NAT rules, debugging load-balanced servers by IP address, accessing internal dev environments on an iPhone, following DRY & KISS principles, Not HARD-CODING and wasting hundreds of processing cycles trying to deliver HTTPS urls to the browser when you store them all as HTTP.  Please understand that the technology world is not as narrow as you think it is.  Enterprise web software has been using these techniques for almost two decades now, you are just wrong and a trillion dollar industry does exist out there that proves it.  Why do you think every major legitimate MVC framework uses root-relative URL techniques by default (J2EE, MVC.NET, APS.NET even, Zend, ROR, Django etc)

They do not limit you, have you ever heard of htaccess url rewrites?  That's how you solve that problem if you want to change the structure of your site without changing the content.  Even wordpress has a rewrite api module that could handle this.

> A fully qualified URL works every time, everywhere. It's easily parsed by search engines.
Actually, root-relative URLs work everywhere in theory, it's only in practice where people make poor programming decisions (like feed readers that ignore the channel-link element) that it fails, or import/export systems that fail to include base domains in processing logic.  But root relative URLS are just as easily parsed by search engines, so stop preaching your misinformation.

I don't know anybody who's said that they're "not possible". However, we do tend to all say that they're a *bad idea*. Which they are.

Using relative-urls, even root relative ones, makes an inherent assumption that your content is only viewed on your website itself, and only in the context of a web browser. This is not necessarily a correct assumption. Furthermore, by making this assumption, you limit the scope of your content unnecessarily.

While I'm sure you probably considered the feed-reader case (where your content is not displayed in the context of your website and so your URLs may not be handled properly by the reader), you may not have considered other cases. What happens when your content gets converted into a book, or print? Having the actual full URL, even in the print, would be nice to be able to drive traffic back to your site. Things like that, things you didn't think of for the future, are reasons why not to use relative URLs.

The only reason to use relative URLs, in fact, is for migration of content from one domain to another. And realistically, this isn't something you should be doing often anyway. And by using root-relative URLs, you limit this case to only migrating content at the same level to begin with. Domain changing only, basically. So it's kind of pointless to do.

A fully qualified URL works every time, everywhere. It's easily parsed by search engines. It works in feed readers. It works no matter where your content is displayed.

You most certainly *can* use relative URLs. You just *shouldn't*.

Possible also means a solution that doesn't break other plugins and is fully backwards compatible.  None of the solutions proposed that I have seen meet that threshold.

Mike, many rss readers support root relative URL's, they do this by processing the relative links from the root domain found in the RSS > Channel > Link node the same way search engine spiders do when they process your html content.  

But you are correct, many readers don't do the proper method so in those cases you can add the domain link programmatically when (and only when) you are exporting content (either via xml, rss, or any other export format you choose.)  Adding it when you create the content (versus only when you export) leads to dozens of technical hurdles that the WP core hacks away to try and solve - grep for HTTPS in the code base and you'll see one of many glaring problems with their absolute URI strategy.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills having to adjust the perception of a practice that is used extensively throughout the web industry (the proper use of root relative urls that is.)

Yes, protocol-relative urls are supported as well, and a great option for referencing third party resources where a domain name *is* necessary.  Thanks Rafael, I knew there were people out there that support this concept.

Sure you can. <img src="/root/relative/url.png"> works fine in a post.

So basically, your solution is to process the content differently
depending on where that content is going to.

For the love of god man, *why*? A whole bunch of code doing detection
or post-processing, just so you can leave out the domain name? I can
think of no greater maintenance hell.

Multiple domain single IP hosting - Virtual Hosting works fine, and
having relative URLs matters not one whit.

Multiple country TLDs - So your solution to not having to post-process
URLs is to post-process URLs? Seriously, changing example.com to
example.co.uk is a simple filter. Making everything root-relative and
then post-processing to add in domains later is a much more complex
filter, and one you'll have to use more often.

Accessing content on staging dev & production sites - You're doing
your staging wrong. I've written about this before, but suffice it to
say that your dev, staging, and production sites should all have the
same domain names on them, not different ones. Furthermore, you can
use DNS trickery or hosts files to then switch between them easily. I
know this works, as I use exactly this method. It works fine.

Reverse-proxies - Reverse proxies don't care about relative URLs vs
absolute ones, so this makes no sense at all.

Internal v external NAT rules - Should be worked around by creating
proper NAT environments or using internal DNS servers for correct
internal address resolution.

Debugging load-balanced servers by IP address - Easily solved with DNS
tricks or hosts files.

Accessing internal dev environments on an iPhone - Has nothing
whatsoever to do with relative/absolute URLs.

Following DRY & KISS principles - The KISS principle would state that
it's better to use the same content everywhere rather than try to
post-process the crap out of it based on friggin' context detection
methods.

Not HARD-CODING and wasting hundreds of processing cycles trying to
deliver HTTPS urls to the browser when you store them all as HTTP. -
is str_replace('http','https'...) too complicated?

> Please understand that the technology world is not as narrow as you think it is. ?Enterprise web software has been using these techniques for almost two decades now, you are just wrong and a trillion dollar industry does exist out there that proves it.

A trillion dollar industry does exist out there *and most of them do it wrong*.

Look, bud, you can rail on me all you want to. I've been programming
for my entire adult life. I have 13 years professional experience, and
I've been coding for the web since 1997. My viewpoint is not "narrow",
and if you want to be a dick and rag on me, that's fine. I don't care.
I'm just stating it like I see it. You're free to disagree, but you're
*not* going to convince me with silly arguments like these.

> Why do you think every major legitimate MVC framework uses root-relative URL techniques by default (J2EE, MVC.NET, APS.NET even, Zend, ROR, Django etc)

Because they suck.

Seriously, MVC frameworks *suck*, for a lot of reasons. This is only
one of them.

I do not use, and will very likely never use any form of MVC web
framework again. I stopping using them specifically because of the
maintenance nightmares.

> They do not limit you, have you ever heard of htaccess url rewrites? ?That's how you solve that problem if you want to change the structure of your site without changing the content. ?Even wordpress has a rewrite api module that could handle this.

If you're going to do that sort of thing, then why need relative URLs
in the first place? Rewrites work just fine. Or a simple filter to
change the domain.

> Actually, root-relative URLs work everywhere in theory, it's only in practice where people make poor programming decisions (like feed readers that ignore the channel-link element) that it fails, or import/export systems that fail to include base domains in processing logic.

Bud, if you're not going to write your code to account for *what
actually exists*, then we already have a un-compromising difference of
opinion.

Yes, in theory, they work fine. In actual fact, they don't. So call me
crazy, but I'm working on facts, not theories.

> But root relative URLS are just as easily parsed by search engines, so stop preaching your misinformation.

Oh, so you know that all search engines that exist, and have seen
their code, and know that they all work absolutely perfectly? Bully
for you.

Again, call me crazy, but I'm not the kind of person to take other
people's code working perfectly on faith. I prefer to assume that
other people write crap code, because then I can write my own to
attempt to work regardless of that. I'm not always successful with
this approach, I grant you, but it's still a better way to work. IMO.

I disagree on a number of points - once again.

While writing this I've just seen "because you might write a book" 
listed as a reason for not changing. Seriously?

Relative URL's change. Sites change domain. Your entire DB is then out 
of date.

Also - access on different platforms can often end up using different 
URL's - if I want my content avaiable in my native iOS application, I 
have to "strip out" the URLs, and replace them with ones that keep the 
user within my native application (rather than the web browser).

Although I feel "because you might write a book", is the poorest reason 
ever, what if I want my book readers to have access to a local version 
of the website (.co.uk VS .com) etc ...?

As stressed many times before - relative URL's *don't* break things for 
anyone.

If need-be: I'd love for this feature to go to a vote - and be decided 
that way.

I beg of the core team to re-think this - the DB overhead that's added 
on our enterprise sites.....

Otto - how do you show clients your test site? I'm sorry but you can't 
call that staging method wrong. Working with a big blue-chip, approval 
often has to be acheived from a number of different teams/companies, 
before part of a website can go live - WITHOUT STOPPING THEIR ACCESS to 
the current live site. Do you want me to go round and change the 
DNS/Host files for *all* of these users in often 4/5 different 
companies? If so - then please also explain how do they access the 
current live site?

DB changes are the only way - yes it can be automated. But why should it 
be. Just because you might write a book?

(thanks for writing that, especially regarding staging/test sites. I can't imagine I could trust any of my clients to touch a hosts file, even if it's easy for techies to do.) 

Seriously - most of my clients can't understand why I have to do a load of work to move from staging to production, when their experience of other CMS systems leads them to think it should be a 5 min job, and to be fair, most of the reasons for full URLs are from a single perspective. I love WordPress, but this is one of those things that I regularly have to battle against, rather than it just working for me and my clients' sites.

Yes, seriously. Not about the book, that's just an example. It's about
your inability to predict the future use to which you will want to put
your content.

WP does some post-processing of content now. It does things like
making quotes into curly quotes, and paragraph formatting, etc. The
data itself though, in the DB, remains unaltered. It's more or less
exactly what you submitted in the first place (ignoring TinyMCE for
the moment).

That's the point. You want that content to remain unaltered and useful
no matter where you put it or how you use it. If you have relative
URLs in that content, then the correctness of the content is now
dependent on the place it is displayed. This is the underlying problem
I have with relative URLs.

> Relative URL's change. Sites change domain. Your entire DB is then out of
> date.

You're correct, however URLs should not change often, and neither
should domains. These are things which, in an ideal scenario, *rarely*
happen. On the other hand, content is often displayed outside the
context of the web site. RSS feeds are the most obvious example.

To optimize your methodology to account for the "almost-never-happens"
case while adding a bunch of new and extra code for the
"happens-a-lot" case seems like a poor way to do things.

Basically, you're saying that because the domain *might* change, you
should be using relative URLs. Then, because relative URLs don't work
everywhere, you should add a bunch of code to detect the cases where
they don't work and post-process the content to convert them to
absolute URLs. But the domain changing is, or should be, infrequent,
and pulling RSS feeds happens a hell of a lot more often. Which is it
better to optimize for?

> Otto - how do you show clients your test site?

Simple: I don't write my code in a way that changing the URL will
break the site. If I need to use "real" content, then I can process it
to change the domain around and thus keep things working with just a
few simple filters and the handy str_replace function.

> Do you want me to go round and change the DNS/Host files for *all* of

No, but that's not the same thing at all. A dev/staging/production
environment is something used by a company to create a continual
development process. It's not the same as a demo or test site that you
would be showing clients. You're mixing ideas here.

Hi Guys-

What is your process for moving sites from stage to production?   I do it
all the time and it takes me about 5 min or less regardless of the urls.
If anything, the only thing that takes more time is moving over any user
uploaded files but thats still pretty easy with tools like git or rsync.

By the way, interesting points in this thread :)

Thanks,

Kevin

I suspect the core conflict is that there are two groups using Wordpress for
different purposes.

In other words this not a "best practices" discussion but a requirements
discussion.

It might be more productive to delve into that angle.  What are the two
groups using the software for?

For example I don't have much use at all for feed readers, but go through
the dev/stage/live swap with frequency.

After uploading all WP data to the FTP, I export the local mysql data and
import on production, upload the searchreplacedb.php to the root WordPress
instalation then run it, it replaces all the 127.0.0.1/site to
domain.comand reserialize it, then I log in to the admin -> permalinks
and then hit
"save permalinks" (or whaterever is called, dont remember now) to regenerate
the permalinks, then im good to go!

Best regards,
Rafael *Ehlers*

Or better yet, can we make this like an option in the admin to check, just
after we install WordPress (before create any posts and etc..) ?!?!

Careful.  This depends *a lot* on who you are, how you develop, and who
you're developing for.  As Jonathan mentioned, it seems there are different
groups doing things in different ways.

For Example:

In my day job, I use a dev/staging/production setup as part of my normal
workflow.  The dev environment is on my local machine - local code, local
db, etc.  I map a domain to my dev environment with my hosts file so that
URLs work appropriately.

Staging is on a remote server.  Separate database, separate copy of the
system.  When I get to a point in my development cycle where I think I'm
ready to go live, I push out from dev to staging and test things out.

Staging != dev ... The staging env is a 100% copy of my production
environment so I can make sure nothing will break.  When I'm ready and sure
it's stable, I push from staging to production.

Alternatively ...

With WordPress it's somewhat different because *I'm working for someone else
*.  The dev environment is the same.  My staging environment is hopefully
set up the same way ... but that's where things change a bit.  I don't own
the production machine - my client does.  I don't control it - my client
does.  So I mimic it as closely as I can with my staging system and use it
to serve up a "beta" of the finished product.

When I'm finished, think it's stable, and the client is done tweaking
content, I migrate everything from staging to production.  This is where
relative URLs would help since the client needs to see both the staging
build and the production build at the same time without flipping their hosts
file back and forth.

Relative URLs are great until they don't work: the RSS issue is significant.
 Also, if I enter something on the editor (including an absolute URL), I
expect (nearly) exactly that to go in the database. I never rely on systems
to always only use relative URLs.  When I migrate, it means
search-and-replace in the database.  Some of these are easier than others.
 Moving from "dev.domain.com" to "www.domain.com" seems the easiest.  Then
again the domain is often somehow listed in the directory structure, and
that may not change right away. In theory there shouldn't be any filesystem
structure in the database, but that's theory.  There's moving from
dev.domain.com/wordpress to www.domain.com. And somewhere in the process
client decided domain should be different, so it's moving from
dev.domain.com/wordpress to www.newdomain.com.

And moving websites does take a bit of time to do it right, pretty  much on
any CMS I've worked with.  The time-consuming part is not moving the CMS:
the problem is migrating all the content, which invariably contains absolute
URLs.  the searchreplacedb script (and being handy with your editor of
choice) helps a bit.  But any database changes are non-trivial, if only
because they are dangerous.  I think of it as disarming a bomb.  Sure,
clipping the blue wire takes about as much time as executing the
search-and-replace. But getting there requires planning.

So what's my process?  I backup twice, think for a long time, and
search-and-replace in the database.  If I started the site and there are no
complications, I keep it simple: from dev.domain.com to www.domain.com is a
much simpler operation.  As I said, I never assume that there are no
absolute URLs, regardless of CMS.

> Sure you can. <img src="/root/relative/url.png"> works fine in a post.

Otto, I see you understand less about this problem than I first thought.  Yes you can add root-relative urls in a post if you do it manually, or via a plugin that adds a filter to strip out the domain.  However you cannot login to a wordpress multisite via the following:

http://127.0.0.1/wp-admin
and
http://localhost/wp-admin
and
http://mycomputer/wp-admin

because wordpress core uses absolute urls.  In doing so, if you attempt to login to that site, regardless of any dns or htaccess tricks up your sleeve you will be stuck in an infinite loop.

It is very simple.  You only every process the content if you are exporting it.  You don't process the content if you are hosting it.
As it stands wordpress processes the content hundreds of times in both situations (exports & hosting.)  There is zero maintenance with root-relative urls.  No host file hacks, no dns tweaks, no spoofing production urls in dev and staging. NO MAINTENANCE.

Sure, add a filter to change example.com to example.co.uk, then try to administer that site from both urls.  Have your UK admin add content from that url, and your US admin add content from the other.  See what happens to your user experience when those URLs are hard-coded in the content.

Replacing ^(/.*)$ with $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $1 is the easiest filter ever.  Replacing example.com with example.co.uk is far more complex if you follow the complete rfc for domain names. And it leads to a slew of other problems I previously mentioned that you failed to address.

Sometimes you don't get to create a proper NAT environment.  Sometimes you are forced to adhere to a company's intranet regulations.  If you work on ANY defense contract you WILL be presented with having to host www.dod.gov, and access it via internal.dod.server1.net if you are on their intranet.  This is obviously a made up example, but the example is pervasive in enterprise industries, not just government networks.  DNS tricks are not allowed and therefor are not a solution.  Relative root urls solves this.

Explain how with wordpress on a load-balanced setup, you could use a DNS trick, to access server4 by IP address, click links, administer content without being redirected back to the gateway when wordpress hard-codes www.gatewayhost.com in every link ever sent back to the browser.  IT CANNOT BE DONE.  If it's so easy, just publish a really simple step by step example for others to understand how.

> Accessing internal dev environments on an iPhone - Has nothing whatsoever to do with relative/absolute URLs.

Again, you don't understand the problem domain if you think this has nothing to do with how WP sends url's to the browser.  When on a WIFI network that doesn't support DNS Tricks, you CANNOT ACCESS WP ADMIN WITH YOUR iPhone.  You have to publish it to a production URL before you can test any of your admin features via the iPhone.  In some cases it's not even your WIFI network, it is your client's and for security reasons related to PCI compliance you are SOL because you can't hack, let alone access their DNS configurations.

Root-relative urls do not require post-processing the crap out of anything.  They actually reduce the total amount of post-processing that WP core currently does - see the HTTP/HTTPS point.  And nice to see that you ignore the DRY aspect of not repeating your domain name in a URL when it doesn't need to be repeated.  Using the same content everywhere is not possible, as expressed by the multitude of problem areas I'm pointing out.

> is str_replace('http','https'...) too complicated?

No, it's not complicated it's just unnecessary.  We call that post-processing the crap out of your url because you violated DRY principles.  Adding complexity to the system (KISS) and ultimately has led to dozens of bugs that still exist in the WP core trac database.

I've been programming enterprise software for 16 years and started systems programming in 1993, and web programming in 1994, does that mean I'm right? No, years of experience has nothing to do with it.  If you think considering your viewpoint as narrow is me being a dick, then I'm sorry you took offense.  But that doesn't mean you're any less of a dick.

Again, you don't understand that it is not possible without root-relative urls, when the WP core validates your domain against a hard-coded value in the database and redirects you to that domain as a result.  Htaccess solves the every so rare use case that you are moving sites AND changing site structure as well.  URL rewrites were invented to solve this very problem.

And yes in actual fact, you would post process content in this very isolated case, along with emails and any other EXPORT of content.  You could write ONE function call it EXPORT_CONTENT(), route everything through this and call it a day.  Real world solution to a real world problem.  A plugin could do this and still reduce overhead that exists in the WP core.

I do know that any search engine that matters or is functional HAS TO DO THIS because over half the internet does.  If it didn't do this, they wouldn't just be lost on my site, they'd be lost on A MAJORITY OF SITES that are built on reputable frameworks that you think suck.  It's called logic and programming for reality a point you made yourself.

Multiple domain single IP hosting - Virtual Hosting works fine, and having relative URLs matters not one whit.

Accessing content on staging dev & production sites - You're doing your staging wrong. I've written about this before, but suffice it to say that your dev, staging, and production sites should all have the same domain names on them, not different ones. Furthermore, you can use DNS trickery or hosts files to then switch between them easily. I know this works, as I use exactly this method. It works fine.

Reverse-proxies - Reverse proxies don't care about relative URLs vs absolute ones, so this makes no sense at all.

Internal v external NAT rules - Should be worked around by creating proper NAT environments or using internal DNS servers for correct internal address resolution.

Seriously, MVC frameworks *suck*, for a lot of reasons. This is only one of them.

I do not use, and will very likely never use any form of MVC web framework again. I stopping using them specifically because of the maintenance nightmares.

Yes, and if you use that content on staging.example.com AND www.example.com it is not useful and does not work in both places - hence it violates "being useful no matter where you put it."

Rarely for you might be true, but for us who use continuous integration practices it is hourly.  We constantly push our content and code on every commit.  Using DNS tricks won't solve replacing content URLs via hacky filters.   Don't assume your practices are universal.  Don't you see the value in having one function that filters your content on export only?  As it stands you filter on export AND serving BECAUSE you use absolute URI's.

Ok, let's be more explicit.  How do you show your client, let's say Google.com, their staging site so they can review features you've added before they go into production?  That is to say, how do you show them staging.google.com, let them login to the admin, make post development edits and testing on new features before pushing it live to www.google.com?  The moment they login to staging.google.com and try to edit a post they will be redirected to www.google.com and they'll be editing live posts because you stored and served absolute URLs.

You either have to hack their DNS/HOST settings, or you have to convert all URLs to staging.google.com, let them test, and then convert their URL's back after they are done with it.  What if you have to re-integrate production changes that occurred into the database while you were demoing it?  That's a maintenance nightmare with hard-coded URL's and prevents you from doing seamless production pushes without a period of downtime while you or your program swaps out urls in a gigabyte sized database.

Not always, sometimes you demo to a client on your staging site.  And when they are external to your network, they can't access your site without being redirected to production in the admin portal, without a slew of str_replace tricks.  And it's not that simple because to do it correctly you have to implement everything I've implemented in my plugin, and even then it won't work for MU sites.

The reality here is that you don't do any of this, because if you did you would immediately recognize our headaches.  You might get away with what you've had to do in the past, but it would not fly with blue-chip industries.  Wordpress isn't even a common selection in this industry because of this fact, (sure  it may power their blog, but it doesn't power their intranet or extranet webapps.)  But it could if they moved away from absolute URL's in the same way that the rest of the industry did back in 97.

Yes, seriously. Not about the book, that's just an example. It's about your inability to predict the future use to which you will want to put your content.

WP does some post-processing of content now. It does things like making quotes into curly quotes, and paragraph formatting, etc. The data itself though, in the DB, remains unaltered. It's more or less exactly what you submitted in the first place (ignoring TinyMCE for the moment).

That's the point. You want that content to remain unaltered and useful no matter where you put it or how you use it. If you have relative URLs in that content, then the correctness of the content is now dependent on the place it is displayed. This is the underlying problem I have with relative URLs.

You're correct, however URLs should not change often, and neither should domains. These are things which, in an ideal scenario, *rarely* happen. On the other hand, content is often displayed outside the context of the web site. RSS feeds are the most obvious example.

To optimize your methodology to account for the "almost-never-happens"
case while adding a bunch of new and extra code for the "happens-a-lot" case seems like a poor way to do things.

Basically, you're saying that because the domain *might* change, you should be using relative URLs. Then, because relative URLs don't work everywhere, you should add a bunch of code to detect the cases where they don't work and post-process the content to convert them to absolute URLs. But the domain changing is, or should be, infrequent, and pulling RSS feeds happens a hell of a lot more often. Which is it better to optimize for?

> Otto - how do you show clients your test site?

Simple: I don't write my code in a way that changing the URL will break the site. If I need to use "real" content, then I can process it to change the domain around and thus keep things working with just a few simple filters and the handy str_replace function.

No, but that's not the same thing at all. A dev/staging/production environment is something used by a company to create a continual development process. It's not the same as a demo or test site that you would be showing clients. You're mixing ideas here.

Message-ID: <CABwjQBxUty88aWk_Mg45BUFCYwfucxVRzvgTT9BZKw2_rBnrLg@mail.gmail.com>

Marcus, your plugin may make relative URLs workable and it's polished (plus,
your code is about as clean & short as it could be for this). However, I
think Otto's points about why core should stick with absolute URLs are
solid. Non-tech users can rely on core this way, and anyone with the
expertise to setup one or more staging servers should stick with the plugin
method (one main reason why plugins are there anyway).

Personally, I think a more-graceful way to handle absolute URLs and multiple
servers is Crowd Favorite's RAMP plugin. It uses a one-time, on-deploy
script. That's similar to what my Capistrano deploy-scripts do, and exactly
what TeamSite does.

My experience with enterprise platforms (I've run both StoryServer and
TeamSite-based orgs) is that they require a huge amount of DNS & config
juggling. Far more than setting-up absolute URLs for a WordPress staging
server. Even with the right DNS, using strictly relative URLs is still a
major hassle and requires pre-deploy audits or alert-scripts.

On both platforms I've worked on this was because there are usually
subdomains/IPs for static pages, subdomains/IPs for dynamic content (Java,
3rd-party licensed DBs/APIs, etc), some resources requiring server-server
authentication, and still other subdomains/IPs for assets and CDN content.
In general, it's near-impossible to access the staging versions of all
necessary resources without a VPN to the staging environment (which would
also solve your problem of accessing a staging server from home).

Mickey, wordpress processes all of your urls every time you host your page or export via rss/email.  What we propose is that you only need to process those URL's when you export via RSS, via a simple function call.  They are always considered as a use case with this concept and are not broken when you choose to host via root-relative ulrs.

Additionally there are things that don't ever make it into an rss feed that are still forced and munged into an absolute URL like local css and javascript files.  These create headaches when moving through staging environments for enterprise developers.

With a modern CMS, you don't have to do this.  You should make a backup, but you should never have to programmatically grep or replace your database, it will cause problems at some point down the road.  What is simpler, than not having to do that at all?

Relative URLs are great until they don't work: the RSS issue is significant.
 Also, if I enter something on the editor (including an absolute URL), I expect (nearly) exactly that to go in the database. I never rely on systems to always only use relative URLs.  When I migrate, it means search-and-replace in the database.  Some of these are easier than others.
 Moving from "dev.domain.com" to "www.domain.com" seems the easiest.  Then again the domain is often somehow listed in the directory structure, and that may not change right away. In theory there shouldn't be any filesystem structure in the database, but that's theory.  There's moving from dev.domain.com/wordpress to www.domain.com. And somewhere in the process client decided domain should be different, so it's moving from dev.domain.com/wordpress to www.newdomain.com.

And moving websites does take a bit of time to do it right, pretty  much on any CMS I've worked with.  The time-consuming part is not moving the CMS:
the problem is migrating all the content, which invariably contains absolute URLs.  the searchreplacedb script (and being handy with your editor of
choice) helps a bit.  But any database changes are non-trivial, if only because they are dangerous.  I think of it as disarming a bomb.  Sure, clipping the blue wire takes about as much time as executing the search-and-replace. But getting there requires planning.

So what's my process?  I backup twice, think for a long time, and search-and-replace in the database.  If I started the site and there are no complications, I keep it simple: from dev.domain.com to www.domain.com is a much simpler operation.  As I said, I never assume that there are no absolute URLs, regardless of CMS.

Same here. 5-10 minutes max, not enough time to get in a sweat over. I use a
script called 'migrate.php' found somewhere along the way to rewrite URL's,
and rsync to do the rest.

And this is more like the crux of the issue.  Is WordPress a platform for
developing webapps or a platform for people to share blog entries?  I'm
starting to feel as if these things are diverging....

Of course you can't. If you have the site on a different URL, then you
need to tell WP what the new URL is.

Is that all that this is about? The Site and Home URLs? Jeez... just
set the WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME defines in the wp-config.php file.

> It is very simple. ?You only every process the content if you are exporting it. ?You don't process the content if you are hosting it.

"Exporting" the content is what happens a large portion of the time.
You're exporting it to a feed, to somebody's feed reader, to
somebody's *browser*, which can be any of dozens of different types of
devices.

Viewing something in a browser is "exporting" it from the database to
the browser, because you don't necessarily know the context in which
the content is being viewed or used.

> As it stands wordpress processes the content hundreds of times in both situations (exports & hosting.) ?There is zero maintenance with root-relative urls. ?No host file hacks, no dns tweaks, no spoofing production urls in dev and staging. NO MAINTENANCE.

No, it's *constant* 100% all-the-time maintainance, because now I have
to add a filter to change those relative URLs you want in the database
to absolute URLs so that the damn things will actually work where the
content is displayed.

Something just under *half* of the views of the content I write are
not actually viewed on my websites themselves. So, how do your
relative URLs work then?

> Sure, add a filter to change example.com to example.co.uk, then try to administer that site from both urls.

Why in the hell are you trying to administer this site from both URLs?
Why should a site even HAVE multiple URLs for the same content? This
makes zero sense.

> Sometimes you don't get to create a proper NAT environment. ?Sometimes you are forced to adhere to a company's intranet regulations.

Convince them otherwise. Seriously, when presented with a stupid rule,
stand the heck up and tell them that it's stupid. You may not get
every contract, but you'll feel better about yourself at the end of
the day.

And sometimes, you can convince them otherwise. Then the world improves.

1. Edit the Hosts file.
2. 1.2.3.4 example.com
3. Done.

Seriously, the load balancer is directing traffic, but only if you hit
it. If the directly line to the server is available, then simply
bypass the load balancer. How you do that depends on your setup, but
assuming it's doing DNS-based balancing or even HTTP traffic
forwarding, then you can just hit that server directly instead of
hitting the load balancer. Hell, I've used this method before. On a
java server I set up, the load balancer was doing traffic forwarding
(all HTTP), but to hit the individual servers, all I had to do was use
their IP address directly.


> Again, you don't understand the problem domain if you think this has nothing to do with how WP sends url's to the browser. ?When on a WIFI network that doesn't support DNS Tricks, you CANNOT ACCESS WP ADMIN WITH YOUR iPhone.

You cannot access wp-admin if you're using the wrong URL of the site,
period. And that's as it should be, because anything else is a
security issue.


> Root-relative urls do not require post-processing the crap out of anything.

They requite converting the relative URLs to absolute ones for half of
my readers. How is that not post-processing?

> And nice to see that you ignore the DRY aspect of not repeating your domain name in a URL when it doesn't need to be repeated.

The domain name absolutely DOES need to be repeated. DRY doesn't enter into it.

The whole point of an absolute URL is that it is *absolute*. That is
*intentional*. That is a *good and desirable thing*. That's the whole
bloody point I'm making. Absolute URLs work in contexts outside of the
website. Relative ones don't.


> Using the same content everywhere is not possible, as expressed by the multitude of problem areas I'm pointing out.

Using the same content works fine as long as you don't tie the content
tightly to the context in which it is displayed.

No, it works in both places, because the URL shouldn't change just
because the content moved. I want a link to point to a specific place,
and I want an image to come from a specific place. If I move the
content, but not the image, and the URL changes, then the content is
now broken.

You're making the assumption that staging.* and production.* are using
the same dataset, unaltered. They should not be. The staging
environment should be wholly separate from the production environment.
If you need to write a script to re-up staging every so often, then
you can filter/alter your data there as needed. But the content
between them should absolutely not be shared. In companies I've worked
at, it explicitly could not be such. That'd get you fired, as well as
being against the law in some ways.

Production data *stays* in production. You don't use it for testing.
You don't use it for staging. You can copy it for testing on the copy,
but you never ever operate on it live from another system.

No, I consider your attitude to be what is making you out to be a dick
here. You're espousing a point of view, and that's fine. But you're
completely ignoring what I see as the VAST MAJORITY of uses of the

Yes, okay, you move sites around a lot. I get it. That's great and
maybe your ideas help you. Fine.

But most people *don't* do that. Most people write content in order to
have that content read by other people. And your ideas make that a)
harder and b) broken. That's what I'm trying to get across to you.
Your viewpoint is your own, and by far not the correct viewpoint for
the majority of people.

That's what I want you to see here. You think that relative URLs are
some kind of fucking godsend idea, whereas I'm trying to tell you that
using relative URLs would *not work* for me or the majority of people
who aren't building sites but are instead just publishing their
content. They cause myriad problems and make things fundamentally
broken. They screw up the whole notion of portable content, and
require a metric fuck-ton of code and CPU work for post-processing. In
other words, for the case where people aren't moving sites around
constantly, relative URLs are a total bitch and a half. That's what
I'm trying to explain to you.

Also, everybody on these mailing lists knows that I'm a dick already.
So I have no problems there.

Except that my plugin adds overhead, doesn't work with multi-site installs, and has a couple of bugs that will require even more core filter hacks to resolve that were recently discovered.  

With root-relative urls at the core, you get rid of all DNS hacks, all staging / migration scripts and can literally use your version control system to push to staging/production with 100% reliability.

This is not true, root-relative urls do not require pre-deploy audits or alert-scripts.  Please provide a use case where you think they do and I will explain why it doesn't.

Subdomains & ip's are still completely compatible with root-relative URLS (please understand I'm not talking about relative urls other than root-relative urls.)  Even with authentication there is no need to hardcode the domain/subdomain/scheme/port in the url.  If a platform you used did require that it was flawed.  

My point is we should take out that flaw in wordpress.  It does not change the behavior of regular users, and makes enterprise uses possible. Regular Users CAN USE THIS WITHOUT ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT.

Staging servers can be publicly hosted to answer your vpn concerns, but still staging servers that hard-code production urls in their database for every link sent to the browser CANNOT be managed or even logged-into with how wordpress core is design without these hacks.

Subject: Re: [wp-hackers] Two new, long-overdue plugins to make your wordpress life a little easier...

Marcus, your plugin may make relative URLs workable and it's polished (plus, your code is about as clean & short as it could be for this). However, I think Otto's points about why core should stick with absolute URLs are solid. Non-tech users can rely on core this way, and anyone with the expertise to setup one or more staging servers should stick with the plugin method (one main reason why plugins are there anyway).

Personally, I think a more-graceful way to handle absolute URLs and multiple servers is Crowd Favorite's RAMP plugin. It uses a one-time, on-deploy script. That's similar to what my Capistrano deploy-scripts do, and exactly what TeamSite does.

My experience with enterprise platforms (I've run both StoryServer and TeamSite-based orgs) is that they require a huge amount of DNS & config juggling. Far more than setting-up absolute URLs for a WordPress staging server. Even with the right DNS, using strictly relative URLs is still a major hassle and requires pre-deploy audits or alert-scripts.

On both platforms I've worked on this was because there are usually subdomains/IPs for static pages, subdomains/IPs for dynamic content (Java, 3rd-party licensed DBs/APIs, etc), some resources requiring server-server authentication, and still other subdomains/IPs for assets and CDN content.
In general, it's near-impossible to access the staging versions of all necessary resources without a VPN to the staging environment (which would also solve your problem of accessing a staging server from home).

Do that dozens of times  a day between three environments and it becomes a complete waste of time, whereas with root-relative urls you don't need it at all.  For you it may be an ok cost, but for continuous integration environments we solved this problem years ago, and don't want to revert because of an architectural mistake.

Same here. 5-10 minutes max, not enough time to get in a sweat over. I use a script called 'migrate.php' found somewhere along the way to rewrite URL's, and rsync to do the rest.

A lot of the points here are rather interesting, but I'm starting to feel like, for some, the conversation is getting a little heated.

Marcus, you may not intend it, but your tone (at least to me) is unnecessarily aggressive. This isn't a debate over whether or not Jesus Christ walked the earth. It's a question of whether absolute or relative URLs make more sense for the typical WordPress install.

Personally (and I do think it's a matter of preference/ evironment) I side with absolute URLs. If it's merely a question of staging vs. production, I think it makes a lot more sense to run a plugin on the staging/dev environments that filters absolute URLs from the production domain, ideally to absolute URLs for the dev/staging environment.

Remember, a _lot_ of content gets shared via cut-and-paste these days. Relative URLs break that 100 percent of the time.

Of course you can't. If you have the site on a different URL, then you
need to tell WP what the new URL is.

Is that all that this is about? The Site and Home URLs? Jeez... just
set the WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME defines in the wp-config.php file.

> It is very simple. ?You only every process the content if you are exporting it. ?You don't process the content if you are hosting it.

"Exporting" the content is what happens a large portion of the time.
You're exporting it to a feed, to somebody's feed reader, to
somebody's *browser*, which can be any of dozens of different types of
devices.

Viewing something in a browser is "exporting" it from the database to
the browser, because you don't necessarily know the context in which
the content is being viewed or used.

> As it stands wordpress processes the content hundreds of times in both situations (exports & hosting.) ?There is zero maintenance with root-relative urls. ?No host file hacks, no dns tweaks, no spoofing production urls in dev and staging. NO MAINTENANCE.

No, it's *constant* 100% all-the-time maintainance, because now I have
to add a filter to change those relative URLs you want in the database
to absolute URLs so that the damn things will actually work where the
content is displayed.

Something just under *half* of the views of the content I write are
not actually viewed on my websites themselves. So, how do your
relative URLs work then?

> Sure, add a filter to change example.com to example.co.uk, then try to administer that site from both urls.

Why in the hell are you trying to administer this site from both URLs?
Why should a site even HAVE multiple URLs for the same content? This
makes zero sense.

> Sometimes you don't get to create a proper NAT environment. ?Sometimes you are forced to adhere to a company's intranet regulations.

Convince them otherwise. Seriously, when presented with a stupid rule,
stand the heck up and tell them that it's stupid. You may not get
every contract, but you'll feel better about yourself at the end of
the day.

And sometimes, you can convince them otherwise. Then the world improves.

1. Edit the Hosts file.
2. 1.2.3.4 example.com
3. Done.

Seriously, the load balancer is directing traffic, but only if you hit
it. If the directly line to the server is available, then simply
bypass the load balancer. How you do that depends on your setup, but
assuming it's doing DNS-based balancing or even HTTP traffic
forwarding, then you can just hit that server directly instead of
hitting the load balancer. Hell, I've used this method before. On a
java server I set up, the load balancer was doing traffic forwarding
(all HTTP), but to hit the individual servers, all I had to do was use
their IP address directly.


> Again, you don't understand the problem domain if you think this has nothing to do with how WP sends url's to the browser. ?When on a WIFI network that doesn't support DNS Tricks, you CANNOT ACCESS WP ADMIN WITH YOUR iPhone.

You cannot access wp-admin if you're using the wrong URL of the site,
period. And that's as it should be, because anything else is a
security issue.


> Root-relative urls do not require post-processing the crap out of anything.

They requite converting the relative URLs to absolute ones for half of
my readers. How is that not post-processing?

> And nice to see that you ignore the DRY aspect of not repeating your domain name in a URL when it doesn't need to be repeated.

The domain name absolutely DOES need to be repeated. DRY doesn't enter into it.

The whole point of an absolute URL is that it is *absolute*. That is
*intentional*. That is a *good and desirable thing*. That's the whole
bloody point I'm making. Absolute URLs work in contexts outside of the
website. Relative ones don't.


> Using the same content everywhere is not possible, as expressed by the multitude of problem areas I'm pointing out.

Using the same content works fine as long as you don't tie the content
tightly to the context in which it is displayed.

No, it works in both places, because the URL shouldn't change just
because the content moved. I want a link to point to a specific place,
and I want an image to come from a specific place. If I move the
content, but not the image, and the URL changes, then the content is
now broken.

You're making the assumption that staging.* and production.* are using
the same dataset, unaltered. They should not be. The staging
environment should be wholly separate from the production environment.
If you need to write a script to re-up staging every so often, then
you can filter/alter your data there as needed. But the content
between them should absolutely not be shared. In companies I've worked
at, it explicitly could not be such. That'd get you fired, as well as
being against the law in some ways.

Production data *stays* in production. You don't use it for testing.
You don't use it for staging. You can copy it for testing on the copy,
but you never ever operate on it live from another system.

No, I consider your attitude to be what is making you out to be a dick
here. You're espousing a point of view, and that's fine. But you're
completely ignoring what I see as the VAST MAJORITY of uses of the
software.

Yes, okay, you move sites around a lot. I get it. That's great and
maybe your ideas help you. Fine.

But most people *don't* do that. Most people write content in order to
have that content read by other people. And your ideas make that a)
harder and b) broken. That's what I'm trying to get across to you.
Your viewpoint is your own, and by far not the correct viewpoint for
the majority of people.

That's what I want you to see here. You think that relative URLs are
some kind of fucking godsend idea, whereas I'm trying to tell you that
using relative URLs would *not work* for me or the majority of people
who aren't building sites but are instead just publishing their
content. They cause myriad problems and make things fundamentally
broken. They screw up the whole notion of portable content, and
require a metric fuck-ton of code and CPU work for post-processing. In
other words, for the case where people aren't moving sites around
constantly, relative URLs are a total bitch and a half. That's what
I'm trying to explain to you.

Also, everybody on these mailing lists knows that I'm a dick already.
So I have no problems there.

Just got a reply with good info, but it came to my person address instead of the mailing list. In case that was intentional, I'm omitting the sender's address, but I thought it should be shared with the list:

>Remember, a _lot_ of content gets shared via cut-and-paste these days. Relative URLs break that 100 percent of the time.

I just did some simple tests and my browsers corrected the URL when cutting and pasting. That is, even though the link was relative when I cut it, it was absolute when I pasted it, if that makes sense.

surprised me.

Yes it can be done. I did *exactly* this last year for a central UK
government client. Where the same site was accessed internally as
http://cms.somesite.gov.uk and externally as http://www.somesite.gov.uk

Incidentally in the same environment there were two other WP instances, test
and long term staging at http://test.somesite.gov.uk  and
http://test2.somesite.gov.uk. At the flick of a switch (a click of a control
panel link), any of the url's could be pointed at a different WP instance. A
different click could copy from one to the other: e.g. bring a copy of live
(wp1) into staging (wp2), ready for adding new content, and click - switch
www and cms to point to instance wp2  and now that's the live one.

All three instances were also accessible with ip addresses if needed!

The secret is apache proxying and mod_substitute.

And this was a 1.5 million uniques amonth site, with more than 50K feed
subscribers, - we really did not wanting be post processing urls in php for
those 50K readers.

Now that is just not true, no matter what you are, otherwise we'd never need the support forums.

You could possibly argue that "regular users" could use this with a modicum of technical support, but that's unproven today since you don't have a large enough user base to measure your assumptions on.  Otto, for all his dickishness, does.

There are enterprise use-cases for just about everything, but for the most part, my experience working for an enterprise has been that the enterprise is the FRINGE use-case of any product, and not the intended/common.  I support enough weird programs at my office and am better at "weird shit" than the vendors specifically because I'm familiar with the weird, and they assume the norm.

This does not mean that the enterprise is wrong, just that the enterprise is different, and while they might like something changed in CORE code, they often need to accept that they are, indeed, the weirdos in this case.

When you make suggestions about changing WP core, you have to consider the needs of the many [tm Star Trek].  Until your plugin garners enough action, we can't know how many people will find it useful.  Maybe Otto is wrong!  Maybe this plugin will become more popular than Akismet and everyone will want to use it.  But it's far more likely that you did exactly what Open Source is supposed to do: You solved a niche problem and shared your solution.

Which fucking rocks :)

If that happens you are doing it wrong.

I search and replace database dumps to copy from dev to test, or production
to dev, every day. None ever break.

Here's a tip: in dev, fake a same length domain name (theclientsdomain.bom
instead of theclientsdomain.com) in your hosts file, in test (that needs to
be publicly hosted so the client can access it) make sure it's on a same
length domain. (get yourself a really short (4- or 5-char) domain so you can
create almost any length domains. I own z1.tl so I can host
theclientsdoma.z1.tl.
As long as it matches the length of the live domain, search and replace
won't break.

And as Otto hinted at, the real important trick is nothing to do with
domains. If you take a copy of production data, the hard bit is mangling the
user's real names and email addresses in the user database so you don't
expose the private data to test or dev staff, or nearly as bad, kick off an
email to 20,000 users for "my test post I just published"

Otto, it's not that simple - changing WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME doesn't fix the problem, wordpress admin will still pull content from other sources.  Additionally, a problem you have ignored from email 1, and WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME are not even evaluated in Multisite setups. They are ignored.  This does not work.  The effort I put into my plugin shows what is required to make it work for 99% of the problem domain and it only works in single site installs.

1.  You still don't get the export content issue.  If you host your content (different from exporting it away from your host) you can use root-relative urls 100% of the time no exceptions, every browser every mobile device will work, it's part of the http protocol standard.  When you export your content, like an rss feed, or email, or xml export, you can then process the content, and only then, which will save you all this hassle of dns tricks, search / replace scripts, wp filter and constant hacks.

2. You solve the export problem with one function.  You don't have to change the database, you feed what is in the database through that really simple filter and you're done for that half of your content.  As it stands wordpress filters all of your url content in every instance of its usage.  You don't need to keep those absolute urls in your database I promise millions of websites do it without any issues.

3. Administering sites from multiple URLs is only part of the equation, and just because it doesn't make sense to you doesn't mean that it is stupid or shouldn't happen due to very legitimate reasons in reality.  Remember that reality statement of yours?  See my DOD example, intranet users have to admin the site from a different url on the internal network, do you expect them to go outside the building to do this?  As it stands Wordpress will try to redirect them to the production url on login and every link click, something that they don't have access to that production URL because of what we call DMZ or a Demilitarized Zone: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)
Yet, they should also be allowed to administer the site from outside the zone (not likely in the military,) but very likely in fortune 500 corporate use - which almost universally use DMZ's, but even still it is by no means restricted to that tier of customer.

4. If you think convincing the military, pci compliant organizations and the rest is just as simple as standing up and shouting you're stupid, you are obviously not seeing both the impossibility of living outside the reality of the world we live in, AND the extreme necessary value and purpose of why their NATS are setup that way. It is NOT STUPID, it's IMPORTANT.  These are not mistakes they are solutions to a world of security problems and will not go away because you don't like it.  Other "sucky" frameworks do not violate these principles which is why they are used prevalently in enterprise environments.  I agree that they have their drawbacks in some aspects, some more than others, but with regard to how they store urls and serve content this is not one of the drawbacks.

5. Your simple solution to bypassing a load-balanced gateway doesn't always work. Try to do it with an iPhone, or other mobile device, or even from a secured OS where you don't have root access to the host files to begin with.  If wordpress didn't have this problem you could do it without any host file configuration.  What security issue exists if I access wp-admin from 127.0.0.1 (or its production equivalent)?  (the answer is there isn't one.)

What it really comes down to in every situation you try to argue is this:

In my world, we use root-relative urls and munge them in one very specific way (add a domain to the beginning) for one very specific use-case (an export of content.)  Done, end of story.

In your world, to solve all of the problems I point out, you have to use dns tricks, rewrite hacks, content search & replacements, and process/munge the URL on every single page request every single time for every piece of content you serve (again whether you realize it or not, http/https) all the while architecturally restricting the use of IP address access, NAT traversal, DMZ configurations, DRY & KISS continuous integration practices and more issues than have even been presented thus far.

The onus is not on me to convince you that root-relative urls work without fail from an architectural standpoint, because the internet has been operating on this principle for the last 20 years.

So I will put the onus on you, explain one scenario in which root-relative URLS does not work, and does not have a viable solution for which you do not already recommend as a standard practice in wordpress today.  You try to say it won't work because we'd have to process the crap out of the data, but then you say the proper way to do it is to process the crap out of the data when you move environments.  You try to say with rss feeds (a clearly defined entry and exit point in the wordpress core) that it would break, yet we currently process the crap out of those absolute urls in rss feeds as it is to prevent it from breaking with absolute urls.  Why not just implement my "architecturally sound fix" in that very specific case?

The ultimate case is there isn't a scenario in which relative root urls are deficient to absolute urls, because in any one of those cases, we can simply replace this ^(\/.*)$ with the domain, and call it a day.  No manual or programmatic network settings, no global replacements in the database.  It just works in your world AND mine.

Of course you can't. If you have the site on a different URL, then you
need to tell WP what the new URL is.

Is that all that this is about? The Site and Home URLs? Jeez... just
set the WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME defines in the wp-config.php file.

> It is very simple.  You only every process the content if you are exporting it.  You don't process the content if you are hosting it.

"Exporting" the content is what happens a large portion of the time.
You're exporting it to a feed, to somebody's feed reader, to
somebody's *browser*, which can be any of dozens of different types of
devices.

Viewing something in a browser is "exporting" it from the database to
the browser, because you don't necessarily know the context in which
the content is being viewed or used.

> As it stands wordpress processes the content hundreds of times in both situations (exports & hosting.)  There is zero maintenance with root-relative urls.  No host file hacks, no dns tweaks, no spoofing production urls in dev and staging. NO MAINTENANCE.

No, it's *constant* 100% all-the-time maintainance, because now I have
to add a filter to change those relative URLs you want in the database
to absolute URLs so that the damn things will actually work where the
content is displayed.

Something just under *half* of the views of the content I write are
not actually viewed on my websites themselves. So, how do your
relative URLs work then?

> Sure, add a filter to change example.com to example.co.uk, then try to administer that site from both urls.

Why in the hell are you trying to administer this site from both URLs?
Why should a site even HAVE multiple URLs for the same content? This
makes zero sense.

> Sometimes you don't get to create a proper NAT environment.  Sometimes you are forced to adhere to a company's intranet regulations.

Convince them otherwise. Seriously, when presented with a stupid rule,
stand the heck up and tell them that it's stupid. You may not get
every contract, but you'll feel better about yourself at the end of
the day.

And sometimes, you can convince them otherwise. Then the world improves.

> Explain how with wordpress on a load-balanced setup, you could use a DNS trick, to access server4 by IP address, click links, administer content without being redirected back to the gateway when wordpress hard-codes www.gatewayhost.com in every link ever sent back to the browser.

1. Edit the Hosts file.
2. 1.2.3.4 example.com
3. Done.

Seriously, the load balancer is directing traffic, but only if you hit
it. If the directly line to the server is available, then simply
bypass the load balancer. How you do that depends on your setup, but
assuming it's doing DNS-based balancing or even HTTP traffic
forwarding, then you can just hit that server directly instead of
hitting the load balancer. Hell, I've used this method before. On a
java server I set up, the load balancer was doing traffic forwarding
(all HTTP), but to hit the individual servers, all I had to do was use
their IP address directly.


> Again, you don't understand the problem domain if you think this has nothing to do with how WP sends url's to the browser.  When on a WIFI network that doesn't support DNS Tricks, you CANNOT ACCESS WP ADMIN WITH YOUR iPhone.

You cannot access wp-admin if you're using the wrong URL of the site,
period. And that's as it should be, because anything else is a
security issue.


> Root-relative urls do not require post-processing the crap out of anything.

They requite converting the relative URLs to absolute ones for half of
my readers. How is that not post-processing?

> And nice to see that you ignore the DRY aspect of not repeating your domain name in a URL when it doesn't need to be repeated.

The domain name absolutely DOES need to be repeated. DRY doesn't enter into it.

The whole point of an absolute URL is that it is *absolute*. That is
*intentional*. That is a *good and desirable thing*. That's the whole
bloody point I'm making. Absolute URLs work in contexts outside of the
website. Relative ones don't.


> Using the same content everywhere is not possible, as expressed by the multitude of problem areas I'm pointing out.

Using the same content works fine as long as you don't tie the content
tightly to the context in which it is displayed.

No, it works in both places, because the URL shouldn't change just
because the content moved. I want a link to point to a specific place,
and I want an image to come from a specific place. If I move the
content, but not the image, and the URL changes, then the content is
now broken.


> Ok, let's be more explicit.  How do you show your client, let's say Google.com, their staging site so they can review features you've added before they go into production?  That is to say, how do you show them staging.google.com, let them login to the admin, make post development edits and testing on new features before pushing it live to www.google.com?  The moment they login to staging.google.com and try to edit a post they will be redirected to www.google.com and they'll be editing live posts because you stored and served absolute URLs.

You're making the assumption that staging.* and production.* are using
the same dataset, unaltered. They should not be. The staging
environment should be wholly separate from the production environment.
If you need to write a script to re-up staging every so often, then
you can filter/alter your data there as needed. But the content
between them should absolutely not be shared. In companies I've worked
at, it explicitly could not be such. That'd get you fired, as well as
being against the law in some ways.

Production data *stays* in production. You don't use it for testing.
You don't use it for staging. You can copy it for testing on the copy,
but you never ever operate on it live from another system.

No, I consider your attitude to be what is making you out to be a dick
here. You're espousing a point of view, and that's fine. But you're
completely ignoring what I see as the VAST MAJORITY of uses of the
software.

Yes, okay, you move sites around a lot. I get it. That's great and
maybe your ideas help you. Fine.

But most people *don't* do that. Most people write content in order to
have that content read by other people. And your ideas make that a)
harder and b) broken. That's what I'm trying to get across to you.
Your viewpoint is your own, and by far not the correct viewpoint for
the majority of people.

That's what I want you to see here. You think that relative URLs are
some kind of fucking godsend idea, whereas I'm trying to tell you that
using relative URLs would *not work* for me or the majority of people
who aren't building sites but are instead just publishing their
content. They cause myriad problems and make things fundamentally
broken. They screw up the whole notion of portable content, and
require a metric fuck-ton of code and CPU work for post-processing. In
other words, for the case where people aren't moving sites around
constantly, relative URLs are a total bitch and a half. That's what
I'm trying to explain to you.

Also, everybody on these mailing lists knows that I'm a dick already.
So I have no problems there.

I just did some simple tests and my browsers corrected the URL when cutting and pasting. That is, even though the link was relative when I cut it, it was absolute when I pasted it, if that makes sense.

surprised me.

A lot of the points here are rather interesting, but I'm starting to feel like, for some, the conversation is getting a little heated.

Marcus, you may not intend it, but your tone (at least to me) is unnecessarily aggressive. This isn't a debate over whether or not Jesus Christ walked the earth. It's a question of whether absolute or relative URLs make more sense for the typical WordPress install.

Personally (and I do think it's a matter of preference/ evironment) I side with absolute URLs. If it's merely a question of staging vs. production, I think it makes a lot more sense to run a plugin on the staging/dev environments that filters absolute URLs from the production domain, ideally to absolute URLs for the dev/staging environment.

Remember, a _lot_ of content gets shared via cut-and-paste these days. Relative URLs break that 100 percent of the time.

The whole point of an absolute URL is that it is *absolute*. That is *intentional*. That is a *good and desirable thing*. That's the whole bloody point I'm making. Absolute URLs work in contexts outside of the website. Relative ones don't.


> Using the same content everywhere is not possible, as expressed by the multitude of problem areas I'm pointing out.

Using the same content works fine as long as you don't tie the content tightly to the context in which it is displayed.

No, it works in both places, because the URL shouldn't change just because the content moved. I want a link to point to a specific place, and I want an image to come from a specific place. If I move the content, but not the image, and the URL changes, then the content is now broken.

You're making the assumption that staging.* and production.* are using the same dataset, unaltered. They should not be. The staging environment should be wholly separate from the production environment.
If you need to write a script to re-up staging every so often, then you can filter/alter your data there as needed. But the content between them should absolutely not be shared. In companies I've worked at, it explicitly could not be such. That'd get you fired, as well as being against the law in some ways.

Production data *stays* in production. You don't use it for testing.
You don't use it for staging. You can copy it for testing on the copy, but you never ever operate on it live from another system.

Yes, okay, you move sites around a lot. I get it. That's great and maybe your ideas help you. Fine.

But most people *don't* do that. Most people write content in order to have that content read by other people. And your ideas make that a) harder and b) broken. That's what I'm trying to get across to you.
Your viewpoint is your own, and by far not the correct viewpoint for the majority of people.

That's what I want you to see here. You think that relative URLs are some kind of fucking godsend idea, whereas I'm trying to tell you that using relative URLs would *not work* for me or the majority of people who aren't building sites but are instead just publishing their content. They cause myriad problems and make things fundamentally broken. They screw up the whole notion of portable content, and require a metric fuck-ton of code and CPU work for post-processing. In other words, for the case where people aren't moving sites around constantly, relative URLs are a total bitch and a half. That's what I'm trying to explain to you.

Also, everybody on these mailing lists knows that I'm a dick already.
So I have no problems there.

Mike, I hear you.  There are cases where you can solve this problem.  But to say that we don't want to add post processing because of performance reasons means you don't understand how the core operates.  It currently post processes every single url in the system, both for content and for system resources in 4 different ways.  My solution would eliminate all of those post-processing functions except for one in the case of RSS feeds and Emails.  And even then you would solve that problem with caching if performance were to take a hit.

I understand that sometimes you can get an organization to change, but you still had to implement an large degree of extra effort that is only available to one specific platform to achieve your goals.  With root-relative URLs those issues disappear entirely.  You are left with one filter for one type of content that is already being filtered with more complexity than what would be necessary with an alternative architecture.

Yes it can be done. I did *exactly* this last year for a central UK government client. Where the same site was accessed internally as http://cms.somesite.gov.uk and externally as http://www.somesite.gov.uk

Incidentally in the same environment there were two other WP instances, test and long term staging at http://test.somesite.gov.uk  and http://test2.somesite.gov.uk. At the flick of a switch (a click of a control panel link), any of the url's could be pointed at a different WP instance. A different click could copy from one to the other: e.g. bring a copy of live
(wp1) into staging (wp2), ready for adding new content, and click - switch www and cms to point to instance wp2  and now that's the live one.

All three instances were also accessible with ip addresses if needed!

The secret is apache proxying and mod_substitute.

And this was a 1.5 million uniques amonth site, with more than 50K feed subscribers, - we really did not wanting be post processing urls in php for those 50K readers.

Ok, Mike if faking a dev name length to match a production name length is the *right* way to do it, and if you can't envision a potential scenario where your staging url or TLD couldn't possibly match the same length as your production site, then maybe you'll at least concede that it's an extra step that doesn't have to happen if we used root-relative urls.

But even still the search and replace of content is only half the problem, there are a world of other issues that are a direct result of storing absolute urls in the database.

If that happens you are doing it wrong.

I search and replace database dumps to copy from dev to test, or production to dev, every day. None ever break.

Here's a tip: in dev, fake a same length domain name (theclientsdomain.bom instead of theclientsdomain.com) in your hosts file, in test (that needs to be publicly hosted so the client can access it) make sure it's on a same length domain. (get yourself a really short (4- or 5-char) domain so you can create almost any length domains. I own z1.tl so I can host theclientsdoma.z1.tl.
As long as it matches the length of the live domain, search and replace won't break.

And as Otto hinted at, the real important trick is nothing to do with domains. If you take a copy of production data, the hard bit is mangling the user's real names and email addresses in the user database so you don't expose the private data to test or dev staff, or nearly as bad, kick off an email to 20,000 users for "my test post I just published"

Actually, no its:

have some very small personal modifications for, but seems to work fine.
 Then I also use the WP_* CONSTANTS in wp-config.php which handles a lot of

Okay, I see what you're saying. But here's the thing: If you have
content with absolute URLs in it, then you never need to process the
content for "exporting" at all. It just works. Absolute URLs work
everywhere. That's sorta the point.

You solve the export problem with one function. ?You don't have to change the database, you feed what is in the database through that really simple filter and you're done for that half of your content. ?As it stands wordpress filters all of your url content in every instance of its usage. ?You don't need to keep those absolute urls in your database I promise millions of websites do it without any issues.

I don't "need" to keep the absolute URL in the database. I *WANT* to
keep it there. Absolute URLs are better than relative URLs. They are
direct links to what they are supposed to link to. They are
unambiguous and not open to interpretation based on the context in
which they are being displayed. That's why they're better.

WordPress doesn't filter my absolute URLs at all. It has no need to do
so, because they are absolute and unchanging. They pass right through
and come out on the webpage, in my feed, pushed to my
social-networks... everywhere they go, they point to the same place
and they-just-work.


> 3. Administering sites from multiple URLs is only part of the equation, and just because it doesn't make sense to you doesn't mean that it is stupid or shouldn't happen due to very legitimate reasons in reality. ...

As Mika pointed out, yours is a fringe use case. And there's nothing
wrong with that, fringe cases are commonplace, but they are all
different and not-the-norm. Having a plugin to help your use case work
better is great. But it should probably remain a plugin.

While my security clearance hasn't been renewed in a while, I did have

experience.


> the extreme necessary value and purpose of why their NATS are setup that way. It is NOT STUPID, it's IMPORTANT. ?These are not mistakes they are solutions to a world of security problems and will not go away because you don't like it.

No, they will go away because a) they rarely solve anything, b)
usually they're implemented badly (often, yes, by idiots), and c) they
cause incompatibility problems up the wazoo.

Look, I get it. I've been there in that world. I've been through that
living corporate hell and back again. In the long run, you're not
thinking politically enough. I know, we just want to be developers,
but the bottom line is that when an organization makes it harder for
you to do your job, and justifies it with nonsense excuses (there is
NO valid security related reason to set up a NAT in the way you
described. Internal DNS resolution is a totally solved freakin'
problem), then you might consider re-evaluating your relationship with
them. Sometimes you have to drop customers, or get customers to see
the light of day. It can suck, but it can also be rewarding.


> Other "sucky" frameworks do not violate these principles...

That depends on your definition of "principles". I would argue that
their adherence to a rigid set of fundamentally incorrect and ill
conceived notions is what makes them suck.

There's good ideas, and there's bad ideas. I reserve judgment on any
idea *to myself*. I judge. I do not assume that 1000 other people
doing it one way means that they are doing it the right way.


> 5. What security issue exists if I access wp-admin from 127.0.0.1 (or its production equivalent)? ?(the answer is there isn't one.)

If you access a site from an incorrect wrong URL, then there is the
possibility of having your admin cookies snatched unless you're in a
tightly controlled environment. Come and log into your wp-admin from
my network, even with SSL, and watch me log in as you immediately
afterwards. Unless you have your domain tightly controlled and secured
with an SSL certificate, which you can verify, you can never be sure
about a potential man-in-the-middle attack.


> You try to say it won't work because we'd have to process the crap out of the data, but then you say the proper way to do it is to process the crap out of the data when you move environments.

Yes, that is exactly correct. Because you shouldn't be moving between
environments that bloody often.


> You try to say with rss feeds (a clearly defined entry and exit point in the wordpress core) that it would break, yet we currently process the crap out of those absolute urls in rss feeds as it is to prevent it from breaking with absolute urls.

What? Where? Why? Absolutely NO processing of my URLs happens in any
of my feeds. That violates the whole concept.


> The ultimate case is there isn't a scenario in which relative root urls are deficient to absolute urls

Relative URLs are deficient to Absolute URLs because Absolute URLs
actually work, and relative ones do not work at all outside of the
webpage context. How can you possibly be still getting this so
fundamentally wrong?

If done properly, which is possible, the experience from a user's perspective is transparent.  There is no difference to regular users what happens in the markup generated by wordpress or the type of urls (specifically when it's a distinction between root-relative and absolute.)  I'm with you that the conversion process will probably generate support issues, but there are solutions to that too.  But those solutions will never be discussed with the current mindset of the wordpress core development community.  

.NET & J2EE are not fringe frameworks.  They drove 75% of websites at their prime and root-relative urls are a core concept.  That is far more than the market share Wordpress has ever had.  

Absolute url usage is a niche problem in the wordpress community, I completely agree with that too.  But it is an artificial problem created by the community that as a result has prevented the platform from garnishing mass adoption outside of what are typically blogging/content delivery uses.  They are venturing into CMS with recent innovations, and that is a great step. 

I don't have a problem with let's see how the plugin does.  I have a problem with the prolific notion that root relative urls are not feasible in the wordpress core, or that they cause massive problems that cannot be overcome technically with simple and elegant solutions.  That you must search & replace your absolute urls because it's the right way.  Preaching lies to people makes the problem systemic and even more difficult to uproot.

Anecdotal remarks of experience does not change cold hard facts that are readily available in books, college curriculum, development communities other than wordpress, and two decades of real world industry-wide usage of software online.

You could possibly argue that "regular users" could use this with a modicum of technical support, but that's unproven today since you don't have a large enough user base to measure your assumptions on.  Otto, for all his dickishness, does.

There are enterprise use-cases for just about everything, but for the most part, my experience working for an enterprise has been that the enterprise is the FRINGE use-case of any product, and not the intended/common.  I support enough weird programs at my office and am better at "weird shit" than the vendors specifically because I'm familiar with the weird, and they assume the norm.

This does not mean that the enterprise is wrong, just that the enterprise is different, and while they might like something changed in CORE code, they often need to accept that they are, indeed, the weirdos in this case.

When you make suggestions about changing WP core, you have to consider the needs of the many [tm Star Trek].  Until your plugin garners enough action, we can't know how many people will find it useful.  Maybe Otto is wrong!  Maybe this plugin will become more popular than Akismet and everyone will want to use it.  But it's far more likely that you did exactly what Open Source is supposed to do: You solved a niche problem and shared your solution.

Which fucking rocks :)

And a good solution to an artificial problem.  But as mentioned before those WP_* constants are not used in wordpress multi-site installations so they don't fix the problem.

Actually, no its:
https://github.com/ErisDS/Migrate/blob/master/script/migrate.php, which I have some very small personal modifications for, but seems to work fine.
 Then I also use the WP_* CONSTANTS in wp-config.php which handles a lot of the potential hassle.

I'm much more concerned about the xtra step that would have to happen for
every single feed request (as well as those other uses of the content I
don't know about). As mentioned, on some sites I've worked on: 50,000
requests at least once per hour. Why should the server have to do that extra
processing request after request, hour after  hour, day after day, to save
me 5 minutes every time I deploy data (which is a lot rarer than when I
deploy code).

Several years (quite literally no-one else has been developing on WordPress
longer than me), several hundred sites, and thousands of deploys later, and
I've yet to come across this "world of other issues".

Are you just trolling, or what?

- Absolute URLs solve the problem which is created by relative URLs.
- "Mass adoption"? Last I checked, WordPress was being used 15% of
websites and by 22% of all newly created domains.
- Are you seriously blaming absolute URLs at preventing WordPress from
being a "CMS"?

They're perfectly feasible for niche cases. For core, they would cause
more problems than they would solve. Mainly because they don't solve
*any* problems for the majority of users.

> That you must search & replace your absolute urls because it's the right way. ?Preaching lies to people makes the problem systemic and even more difficult to uproot.

If you continue to call arguments that you disagree with "lies", then
we'll know you're just trolling. Please try to have a civil discussion
for once.

Be very careful trying to tell *me* I don't understand how WordPress works.
 Please point me to the code that processes every single url in four
different ways for every single request. File name and line numbers, please,
trunk or 3.2.1

I didn't get the organisation to change, they insisted it be like that,
because it meant that it was then easy to have wp-admin completely blocked
from the www access route and allowed from the cms route. And it really
wasn't a large degree of effort, I'm really good at what I do, it was easy.

Sure, that would be a problem. However, if your site is that big, then you
should have a suitable caching plugin in use, no?

Otto, I appreciate the moderated tone.  I will respond in kind.

Sunrise.php solutions will not fix the multisite problem, unless you intend to do database updates on every page access.  And given the concurrent nature of the web this will literally be impossible without using a processing stack in a non-grid environment.

The onus is still on you to provide a security concern with accessing a site from either the IP address or the DNS name.  Accessing the wrong IP or DNS name is equally possible, and the reason you are not allowed access to NAT configurations and changing DNS entries in corporate environments is specifically to prevent those man in the middle attacks that allow you to steal passwords (in the case of wordpress only the encrypted form.)  You may think those practices don't solve anything, but it isn't germane to my point.  There is no inherent security flaw to accessing a site via it's IP address or DNS entry.

But the key point you miss, the fundamental flaw in this discussion is this:

What? Where? Why? Absolutely NO processing of my URLs happens in any of my feeds. That violates the whole concept.

Wordpress processes your URLs on every single request, for both content and for system internals.  The very premise of using is_ssl() to change http to https or vice-versa is to post-process your urls.  And there is no solution to that without using only one or the other and directly modifying core files.  Until then your site, your feeds, and your content are post processing every single url that every reaches a browser, book, email, rss feed or xml file for every single request.

In my world that would never happen if I could stop it, and in my world doing that is wrong.

Multisite is indeed special, I grant you that. However, it's quite easy to make yourself a custom sunrise.php file and use that to fiddle with the multisite variables all you like.

Okay, I see what you're saying. But here's the thing: If you have content with absolute URLs in it, then you never need to process the content for "exporting" at all. It just works. Absolute URLs work everywhere. That's sorta the point.


> 2. You solve the export problem with one function. ?You don't have to change the database, you feed what is in the database through that really simple filter and you're done for that half of your content. ?As it stands wordpress filters all of your url content in every instance of its usage. ?You don't need to keep those absolute urls in your database I promise millions of websites do it without any issues.

I don't "need" to keep the absolute URL in the database. I *WANT* to keep it there. Absolute URLs are better than relative URLs. They are direct links to what they are supposed to link to. They are unambiguous and not open to interpretation based on the context in which they are being displayed. That's why they're better.

WordPress doesn't filter my absolute URLs at all. It has no need to do so, because they are absolute and unchanging. They pass right through and come out on the webpage, in my feed, pushed to my social-networks... everywhere they go, they point to the same place and they-just-work.

As Mika pointed out, yours is a fringe use case. And there's nothing wrong with that, fringe cases are commonplace, but they are all different and not-the-norm. Having a plugin to help your use case work better is great. But it should probably remain a plugin.

While my security clearance hasn't been renewed in a while, I did have one and I have worked on DoD funded projects. So I do know wherefrom I speak here. And yes, telling a top-brass General that the people he's been listening to up-until-now are idiots was indeed a rather fun experience.

No, they will go away because a) they rarely solve anything, b) usually they're implemented badly (often, yes, by idiots), and c) they cause incompatibility problems up the wazoo.

Look, I get it. I've been there in that world. I've been through that living corporate hell and back again. In the long run, you're not thinking politically enough. I know, we just want to be developers, but the bottom line is that when an organization makes it harder for you to do your job, and justifies it with nonsense excuses (there is NO valid security related reason to set up a NAT in the way you described. Internal DNS resolution is a totally solved freakin'
problem), then you might consider re-evaluating your relationship with them. Sometimes you have to drop customers, or get customers to see the light of day. It can suck, but it can also be rewarding.


> Other "sucky" frameworks do not violate these principles...

That depends on your definition of "principles". I would argue that their adherence to a rigid set of fundamentally incorrect and ill conceived notions is what makes them suck.

There's good ideas, and there's bad ideas. I reserve judgment on any idea *to myself*. I judge. I do not assume that 1000 other people doing it one way means that they are doing it the right way.

If you access a site from an incorrect wrong URL, then there is the possibility of having your admin cookies snatched unless you're in a tightly controlled environment. Come and log into your wp-admin from my network, even with SSL, and watch me log in as you immediately afterwards. Unless you have your domain tightly controlled and secured with an SSL certificate, which you can verify, you can never be sure about a potential man-in-the-middle attack.


> You try to say it won't work because we'd have to process the crap out of the data, but then you say the proper way to do it is to process the crap out of the data when you move environments.

Yes, that is exactly correct. Because you shouldn't be moving between environments that bloody often.


> You try to say with rss feeds (a clearly defined entry and exit point in the wordpress core) that it would break, yet we currently process the crap out of those absolute urls in rss feeds as it is to prevent it from breaking with absolute urls.

What? Where? Why? Absolutely NO processing of my URLs happens in any of my feeds. That violates the whole concept.

Relative URLs are deficient to Absolute URLs because Absolute URLs actually work, and relative ones do not work at all outside of the webpage context. How can you possibly be still getting this so fundamentally wrong?

Mike, read my email to Otto, it happens now on every single feed, the wordpress core does this today, on every single url in the system.

I'm much more concerned about the xtra step that would have to happen for every single feed request (as well as those other uses of the content I don't know about). As mentioned, on some sites I've worked on: 50,000 requests at least once per hour. Why should the server have to do that extra processing request after request, hour after  hour, day after day, to save me 5 minutes every time I deploy data (which is a lot rarer than when I deploy code).

Several years (quite literally no-one else has been developing on WordPress longer than me), several hundred sites, and thousands of deploys later, and I've yet to come across this "world of other issues".

Correction, it doesn't do it to urls in the content, but your rss feeds urls are absolutely post processed

Otto, I appreciate the moderated tone.  I will respond in kind.

Sunrise.php solutions will not fix the multisite problem, unless you intend to do database updates on every page access.  And given the concurrent nature of the web this will literally be impossible without using a processing stack in a non-grid environment.

The onus is still on you to provide a security concern with accessing a site from either the IP address or the DNS name.  Accessing the wrong IP or DNS name is equally possible, and the reason you are not allowed access to NAT configurations and changing DNS entries in corporate environments is specifically to prevent those man in the middle attacks that allow you to steal passwords (in the case of wordpress only the encrypted form.)  You may think those practices don't solve anything, but it isn't germane to my point.  There is no inherent security flaw to accessing a site via it's IP address or DNS entry.

But the key point you miss, the fundamental flaw in this discussion is this:

What? Where? Why? Absolutely NO processing of my URLs happens in any of my feeds. That violates the whole concept.

Wordpress processes your URLs on every single request, for both content and for system internals.  The very premise of using is_ssl() to change http to https or vice-versa is to post-process your urls.  And there is no solution to that without using only one or the other and directly modifying core files.  Until then your site, your feeds, and your content are post processing every single url that every reaches a browser, book, email, rss feed or xml file for every single request.

In my world that would never happen if I could stop it, and in my world doing that is wrong.

Multisite is indeed special, I grant you that. However, it's quite easy to make yourself a custom sunrise.php file and use that to fiddle with the multisite variables all you like.

Okay, I see what you're saying. But here's the thing: If you have content with absolute URLs in it, then you never need to process the content for "exporting" at all. It just works. Absolute URLs work everywhere. That's sorta the point.


> 2. You solve the export problem with one function. ?You don't have to change the database, you feed what is in the database through that really simple filter and you're done for that half of your content. ?As it stands wordpress filters all of your url content in every instance of its usage. ?You don't need to keep those absolute urls in your database I promise millions of websites do it without any issues.

I don't "need" to keep the absolute URL in the database. I *WANT* to keep it there. Absolute URLs are better than relative URLs. They are direct links to what they are supposed to link to. They are unambiguous and not open to interpretation based on the context in which they are being displayed. That's why they're better.

WordPress doesn't filter my absolute URLs at all. It has no need to do so, because they are absolute and unchanging. They pass right through and come out on the webpage, in my feed, pushed to my social-networks... everywhere they go, they point to the same place and they-just-work.


> 3. Administering sites from multiple URLs is only part of the equation, and just because it doesn't make sense to you doesn't mean that it is stupid or shouldn't happen due to very legitimate reasons in reality. ...

As Mika pointed out, yours is a fringe use case. And there's nothing wrong with that, fringe cases are commonplace, but they are all different and not-the-norm. Having a plugin to help your use case work better is great. But it should probably remain a plugin.

While my security clearance hasn't been renewed in a while, I did have one and I have worked on DoD funded projects. So I do know wherefrom I speak here. And yes, telling a top-brass General that the people he's been listening to up-until-now are idiots was indeed a rather fun experience.


> the extreme necessary value and purpose of why their NATS are setup that way. It is NOT STUPID, it's IMPORTANT. ?These are not mistakes they are solutions to a world of security problems and will not go away because you don't like it.

No, they will go away because a) they rarely solve anything, b) usually they're implemented badly (often, yes, by idiots), and c) they cause incompatibility problems up the wazoo.

Look, I get it. I've been there in that world. I've been through that living corporate hell and back again. In the long run, you're not thinking politically enough. I know, we just want to be developers, but the bottom line is that when an organization makes it harder for you to do your job, and justifies it with nonsense excuses (there is NO valid security related reason to set up a NAT in the way you described. Internal DNS resolution is a totally solved freakin'
problem), then you might consider re-evaluating your relationship with them. Sometimes you have to drop customers, or get customers to see the light of day. It can suck, but it can also be rewarding.


> Other "sucky" frameworks do not violate these principles...

That depends on your definition of "principles". I would argue that their adherence to a rigid set of fundamentally incorrect and ill conceived notions is what makes them suck.

There's good ideas, and there's bad ideas. I reserve judgment on any idea *to myself*. I judge. I do not assume that 1000 other people doing it one way means that they are doing it the right way.

Come and log into your wp-admin from my network, even with SSL, and watch me log in as you immediately afterwards.

Then you have never tried to access the wp-admin from an iphone on your development network using a router that you don't have administrative access to.  That's fine, it's not a big deal to you.  To some it's a systemic problem that doesn't need to exist.

Yes, I will, and I'm sorry for saying every single url, I corrected myself in another reply to say it does not correct content urls.  But grep for http/https and is_ssl to see what I am referring to.  The wordpress core processes those urls to substitute the scheme when served over SSL.  There are four strategies at use: str_replace, preg_replace, parse_url and substr.  

That is post-processing that happens on the wordpress core.  I have recently submitted a patch to abstract the copy-pasted logic into a central function for future refactoring.

Be very careful trying to tell *me* I don't understand how WordPress works.
 Please point me to the code that processes every single url in four different ways for every single request. File name and line numbers, please, trunk or 3.2.1

I didn't get the organisation to change, they insisted it be like that, because it meant that it was then easy to have wp-admin completely blocked from the www access route and allowed from the cms route. And it really wasn't a large degree of effort, I'm really good at what I do, it was easy.

I think what what Marcus is looking for isn't how WP is designed. sure 
there are workarounds (i believe there always is one, you just have to 
look), but I also believe in using the right tool/framework/platform for 
the job. Think of WP using absolute urls as a feature and consider that 
when picking a platform to work with.

WP isn't designed for everybody, and I"m sorry but I side with with 
absolute urls too. It's not because I prefer it and I do use  relative 
urls when I can, but it's mainly because of two things: 1)MAJORITY of 
the users won't care  2) it's how WP was built and changing this is 
going to break many things and I personally believe it's not worth the 
effort.

My point is, if you absolutely need relative urls in your project, then 
do what Otto says: "Feel free to not use it."

I don't mean this to be sarcastic in any way. It's what I'd do too. Pick 
a platform (EE, Drupal, WP) depending on the requirements. if none of 
the platforms don't meet the requirements (usually due to some crazy 
weird setup) and creating the custom stuff will be too much work, (have 
only encountered this once) then I drop the project. Could be hard at 
first but you'll get used to it. And here's one thing you'll realize, 
there's no shortage of projects when your good in what you do =)

No one's forcing you to use WP. I personally think it's not that great 
compared to the two other platforms I mentioned (EE, Drupal), but I 
don't go all out always using Drupal when all the project needs is a 
blog. See what I mean?

> You beat me to it.  And I apologize for my tone, I don't mean that towards anyone but Otto, and only him because he replies in kind and has done so for years on these forums.  He likes to think his way is the right way and everyone else does it wrong.

No it doesn't suck that you're not in my world.  It sucks that I can use wordpress in my world because of it.  If our worlds merged we'd both be happy.  Oh well. 

I'm with you all on pick a different product if I don't like it.  I'm with you on a number of your points.  But to say it can't be don't with root relative urls is incorrect, and it sucks that my frustration with Otto bled over to others.  

I really am sorry for that.

But I'm also a believer in open source software, and would hope that ideas weren't stymied so quickly because they don't present a problem to a limited domain.

Anyway, I'm done with this thread too, I won't bother you all anymore.   I'll still support wordpress in every way that I can because I do like the product.  And I'll continue to push core filter hacks so that those who want root relative urls can have them.

Thanks,
Marcus

But these are *not* content URLs with one exception (see below), so the
whole point of your argument has just been blown away. The current situation
is that for *every single* consumer of your content, the absolute urls work,
no processing required.
Your suggestion to move to relative urls and post-process for the cases that
need it therefore is, by definition, extra work required that wasn't there
before.
When I say the majority of cases, I don't mean users, or website owners or
developers or designers, I mean each and every single request for content.
On wordpress.com alone, that stands at 2.5 billion page views per month. If
only 1% of that figure were feed readers, that's 25 million requests that
need the extra processing, versus none now.

Holding that up against a relative handful of developers needing to deploy
from test to live or dev to live a few times a month at most, and it doesn't
stand up.

And from, your own descriptions, if you have untranslated live content on a
test server, then, in my opinion, you are doing it wrong.

(the one exception I can see is displaying the theme header page, where the
absolute url of the header image, may need to be changed (http -> https), if
you are running your admin under https.

Not entering into the general debate, but just curious, but why can feeds like this be cached?  Seems like a once-an-hour cache would completely solve that problem AND be better anyway?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Potential Solution for Absolute vs. Root Relative URLs?
Message-ID: <227BFC4C-F28E-4832-ABD5-7C1677028771@newclarity.net>

Hi all:

Okay, I may be stepping into it (I really hope not) but I'm wondering if I can refocus the absolute/relative URL discussion?  

In the other thread I think Jonathan Bailey hit the nail on the head; this debate is primary premised on the requirements of each use-case, and each person is arguing the approach that they believe best resolves their respective use-cases.  Said another way, we have lots of blind men here and everyone is trying to describe an elephant. (Jonathan unsubscribed from the list so I've cc'd him given that I'm trying to address his point; I hope he appreciates my cc-ing him.)

I'd like to propose something but first I'd like to document my perceptions?   There seem to be several factions represented here:

1.) Those who passionately care about the **End-user Blogger** use-case.  This (it seems to me) is the primary use-case for WordPress and that which most of the core WordPress team care passionately about. Anything that benefits the end-user blogger use-case is viewed as "good" while things that don't benefit them or worse that complicate things for them are "bad." This use-case is benefitted greatly by inter-changable themes and the broad array of plugins, all of which end-users can add to their site.

2.) **Professional small shops** who build and deploys sites for small business clients.  This use-case is mostly synergistic with use-case #1 because most of these can use the exact code that benefits end-user bloggers. Often these client sites have a large blogging component too and a site developer can easily assemble a great site using available plugins. And for occasional site deployment it's easy enough in most cases to spend the "just 5 minutes" it takes to move things around.

3.) **Enterprise-level/Larger Agency** use for large-scale sites, especially ones that are more CMS oriented than blog oriented.  This group's needs are often in conflict with the end-user blogger use-case. Things that make management easier make it more difficult for the end-user, add unnecessary overhead to a site, etc.  So it is the people using WordPress for this use-case that get very frustrated because use-case #1 always gets priority in the world of WordPress.

Is this a fair assessment?

If yes, I think that while we won't solve the larger conflict today we might actually be able to come up with a truce for the absolute vs. root relative URL standoff.  First and foremost I believe that WordPress will continue absolute URLs, period.  It's apparently what fits the blogging use-case best, it's what the core WordPress team believes in and it's what most of the more influential members of the WordPress community believe in. Given that, chances it will change are nil.

OTOH for use-case #3 there are those who would really, really like relative URLs (and please even for those who like Otto disagree that it is needed please just agree to disagree.)

So here's the proposal:

1.) Is there any reason WordPress can't add a constant like ROOT_RELATIVE_URL that if defined would allow root-relative URLs, ASSUMING that the people advocating here create the patch, get the code accepted by the core team, and then do lots and lots of testing?

2.) If #1 is unacceptable and there are hooks that could be added to make it easier to implement root relative URLs, is there any reason why the core team would have a problem adding those hooks?  I know there is now a root relative plugin but its implementation may be much more complex than if changes were made to the core (I'm only assuming since I've not really studied it much.)  Will the core team add requested hooks to address this use-case?

Anyway, thanks in advance for considering what hopefully could be an amicable and final solution to what has become a debate that flares up repeatedly on the hackers forum. :-)

Haha.. this thread was fun reading.

Yeah, I get what you mean. There have been a couple instances where I 
wanted to use WP but picked another platform instead bec the other 
platforms had it natively or were designed for the functionlity I 
wanted, whereas I knew it'd be a pain to maintain if I used wp. So yeah, 
it sux =)

But hey, don't let Otto being a "dick" or anyone else for that matter 
get to you aight. Keep doing what you are doing and if it gets enough 
traction your hacks/plugins may get itself to the core. Think WP menus, 
cpt.. how many versions ago was it talked about before it was merged 
with core?

But yeah, reading this thread, I think *some* people just countered too 
strongly with your idea - of course it didn't help that you fought fire 
with fire =) - and it's a great idea actually although unfortunately 
majority of users won't care or be affected.

anyway, thank you for the Editor Markup plugin =)

I was merely suggesting other plugins that would be useful. Perhaps
this is not the thread for it.
I have tried like many web designers using wordpress to adapt existing
themes to match my needs.
I was thinking that a plugin would be useful that lists the various
changes to the default settings
something like windows system info use to do. The second point is that
if someone wants to make registered users posts easy to do without
using the dashboard I would like to see a plugin for that.
I do have a third wish and that is a plugin that handles user pages
that does not require the dashboard access.

Thanks for asking

I can see both sides of this discussion - I personally favor relative 
URLs stored in the DB, but I recognize the fact that absolutes (with 
regard to newbies) are probably less hassle.

I suspect this is probably a 75/25 problem -- 75% of the people don't 
care or want it the way it is, and 25% want at least the option of 
relative URLs.

Seems like there's a pretty easy solution though:

- Absolute/relative URL option in the admin

- Absolute is default and recommended (so existing installs and plugins 
don't break)

- If you toggle the option, an internal function can add/remove the 
domain from the database (can't have mixed absolutel/relative URLs)

- Add an external filter when relative is enabled to add the 
domain for RSS/email feeds

This way, the default install remains exactly the same (i.e. no 
additional filters), and the relative URL option only has an additional 
filter on external exports, which seems to be acceptable.

Three simple pieces?  There might be other circumstances that need to be 
addressed but I'll leave that up to those smarter than I.

No problem (for me anyway), I just didn't understand what you were asking and I was interested to know.  We might write such a plugin.  How would you want to see the results accessed and/or delivered?

You mean something that lists the changes in wp_options from default, or something more than that?

Ah.  Kinda like Gravity Forms?  There are probably others that are free too.

Okay. Have you looked?  I'd be surprised if there were not plugins that do that already.  

I know BuddyPress does, but of course that's overkill for most use-cases. :)

That runs afoul of a sacred principle of the WordPress philosophy[1]: "Decisions, not Options."  I know because I have been pointed to that passage several times in the past.

What I do think is *potential* is for a constant or a value in the wp_options table that can be accessed via a plugin to enable the rest of what you suggest.  It all depends on if the core team would be willing to add such an internal option, of course.

I used to have a plugin (pre-3) to do this. However, I've stopped
distributing it because 1) There were some security issues I didn't want to
fix and 2) It seemed like Custom post types made this easy, so why bother to
do a plugin which would have 100s of feature requests, when it is fairly
easy to just set up custom post types and a couple of forms (if you want to
avoid the dashboard) to do it.

You pretty well get what I'm saying but I'm thinking that when plugins
cause a theme to stop functioning it would be nice to be able to find
the source of the conflict. So not sure what wp_options does but I
know that with regard to being able to track down conflicts it would
be useful to get a screen that can be copied and pasted or better yet
emailed to someone.

Fast Secure Contact Form Allows a user to enter data using a form and
I think it be sumitted by mail
but I would like it if it would put a post for pending review. Sorry
if you're interested I can give more details after I review it. It's
been a while since I looked at this.

The Gravity Forms and Buddy Press were two that I looked at and found
them more complex than what I wanted.

That sounds good Chrstopher.

Are you saying there is a procedure for custom post types
or a plugin called "Custom Post Types"?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Potential Solution for Absolute vs. Root Relative
	URLs?

Message-ID: <2bd12854-7a5c-43c2-aed4-df4ef7bac447@f27g2000yqn.googlegroups.com>

I've been reading this all day, and the only thing I'm so confused
about is why the heck the solution can't simply be:

1. Add hooks where needed to enable/disable the absolute functionality
2. Those same hooks above could also be made on any place the url is
output.

We don't care what the output is, just append it with
bloginfo('wpurl') or bloginfo('siteurl') and boom it's good. Relative
links should be forced to the root of the site, that's no problem in
my eyes (WP installed in sub-directories).

Besides all that Mike said (that makes sense, as opposed to the
blanket no from everyone opposed to relative URLs), all people like me
care about is the DB, keep the DB clean of absolute URLs and that's
the solution. I keep seeing the comment about "what about if it's in a
book" or "what about rss", that's all trivial -- the solution is to
output the siteurl / wpurl any place the URLs would be expected, like
in get_permalink, etc... or even on src="/relative/url/img.jpg" and
href="/relative/url/page/", that's simple as pie. Just give us more
than what we've got, don't force us to hack WP to do what we want,
give us an option (yes, we are numerous) that makes it easy for us NOT
to hack but gives everyone else what they want too (implement better
hooks, etc).

The plugin was called profiles.

There's a development branch at
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/profiles/trunk/which contains a lot of cruft
in wp-data which was an attempt at
implementing what eventually became custom post types (but not a very good
attempt at it).

Seriously, don't use the plugin in its current form, as it has a major SQL
injection attack (it was the first WP plugin I wrote).

Since it sounds like there's interest in this, I'll try and break some time
free over the weekend to code up a version that uses custom post types.

Mike Little, I know I said I'd drop the topic on this list, but I didn't want to ignore your requests for information.

You can look at the patch I referenced, you'll see line numbers and file names, there are a lot of references so it's just easier to look here... 
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/19037/ssl.patch

Everything that passes through things like get_site_url in link-template.php, self_link in feed.php, class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php etc gets processed, and there are a bunch of links that go through those low level functions.

You can see how many actually get processed by looking at each of the filters I attach to in the plugin I created to support root-relative urls:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/root-relative-urls/
Add a debugging statement in each of the filter functions to see how many times they are called per page load, you might be surprised.

Alternatively you can grep for is_ssl\( and you'll see just about every reference to the post-processing that occurs on every system url.

It is not just 1% of rss feed content links versus 0% overhead now, each of those links is processed on page load when they don't have to under a root-relative architecture.  But I won't continue to persuade anyone anymore on this list I'm truly sorry.  

However, if anyone would like to continue and honest discussion on this topic I can be reached at marcus.pope at springbox.com

Thanks,
Marcus

(apologies interrupting the popcorn thread)

I had an idea for a small plugin. I searched on the name, and visited the
potential wordpress.org URL. Finding no direct matches I assumed that I had
been the first and submitted it. But, erm, no. Unsurprisingly someone
thought of it years ago, long enough to have made no edits for 970+ days.

Sorry if I have caused trouble or offence. What is my best course of action
(or will it all 'come out right in the wash')?

If I may put in my two cents to the absolute vs relative uri debate.  I am
a relative newb to the web dev world and most of my work with WP is for
single sites for small businesses that may or may not want a blog.
Basically we use WP as a CMS becuase it's light-weight and easy to use.
For this reason, I've only recently started using version control systems.
My typical workflow is

1. Client hires me to upgrade their site to WP
2. I create a WP installation at example.com/wp and set up the necessary
themes/plugins etc.
3. The create content.
4.  Once we're satisfied we go live.  The process for this is here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Moving_WordPress

I am almost always frustrated by the fact that this is a 16 step process
but more importantly I often forget step 11, and my client is confused as
to why all of their images won't show up.  I realize that I'm probably not
doing it right and would love suggestions on this, but the point is that my
approach isn't fundamentally stupid for my use case.  I'm guessing lots of
people have run into this exact issue.  Relative URLs would fix this. I
don't know enough about the various security concerns etc. to say more but
I would certainly love to see a constant, something like WP_RELATIVE_PATHS,
that I could set to true at the beginning that would turn on the correct
export filters and change the way things were put into the content in the
first place.

Peace

But there are not *content* urls. These are the app urls to take you to the
edit page or the plugins page . They *have* to change from one site to
another, and because WordPress allows you to run the back end half of your
installation on https separate from the front end half, then yes, there
*has* to be a check and a possible replace http for htps. But, as I say,
this is the back end admin functions and those are accessed very
infrequently compared to the front end *content*

This example does not support your case.

Here's the bit where you are going wrong! By doing this you are *creating*
the pain. And relative URLs would not stop this.

See my  tips (below) (and in one of these threads) for making it easy to
transfer from development site to live site

doing it right and would love suggestions on this,


As I mentioned elsewhere, get your self a short domain. Create your clients
site on a subdomain of it (with a character count exactly the same length of
the live domain) so that wordPress is in the root of the site. Install
plugins, themes, tweak and deveop, add content.
When ready to go live:
DB dump,
search and replace developdomain with livedomain,
db load on live.
transfer all files from dev to live.
Done.  4 steps.

It usually takes me a few minutes, always less than 30 minutes (depending on
the amount of files and content) and *never* goes wrong.

No they wouldn't: /wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/29/my-images.jpg still
needs to be changed to /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/29/my-images.jpg
regardless of whether it start with the domain or not.

Once and a while I'm questioned about Blogger limiting posts when exporting/migrating. Is that a local issue, an user misuse or really a Blogger limitation?!

WordPress.com to WordPress hosted is quite simples and neat, but Blogger makes life harder. I heard that Blogger users must try to import between Blogger and WordPress.com, so servers will connect at least, then export to hosted WordPress, is that a fact?! Never had a huge Blogger myself, so I really know nothing about all this.

Thanks for any advice

Aw c'mon, no offense to Mike, but that's just ridiculous, please,
seriously, just use this script:

http://www.interconnectit.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/searchreplacedb2.zip

It's an easy process:

1. Change DB Connection in wp-config.php
2. Upload all WP files from local to production (and searchreplacedb.php to
root file of wp)
3. Export DB from local to production
4. Run searchreplacedb.php
5. Log in to WordPress -> Settings -> Save Permalinks (to regenerate)
6. Profit!!!


Seriously, use that script!

Best regards,

Rafael Ehlers

Mike, app urls do not have to change or be post processed. With root-relative urls you inherently do not specify http or https on links returned to the browser and the browser will maintain that ssl connection for you, guaranteed. In the event that someone navigates directly to an http url when they should have gone to https wordpress already does a redirect to the proper scheme. 

They do not apply to back end functions only. Install my plugin and browse a front end page. You will see just how often they are called with a simple debug statement to your error log. get_site_url and others in that patch are universally executed functions (front and back.)

Hope that information helps you find what I'm referring to.

I've run into this same issue a few times and become frustrated, 
especially since I didn't think about doing the search and replace with 
a script, wasn't enough of a problem yet to care enough. That seems to 
be the best solution, especially considering that it would only need to 
be done once, and not to leave the links "undefined" and then each web 
request, and the editor, would need to determine them.

Seriously, you still have more steps than me. I do this day in and day out,
and it's never a problem. Such things are bread and butter to me.

Besides, when that script first came out it wasn't good enough, it didn't
cope with all situations (e.g. nested arrays). I'm sure it's lots better
now (I've worked with and for the author on a number of occasions), but
I've not bothered to look into it. I had a working solution before it came
a long and a still working solution now.
The other thing I don't like is the giant security hole that opens for the
length of time that script exists on your server (or maybe that's fixed to).

I understand what you are *now* referring to, but the major thrust of your
argument at the beginning of these threads, and the major objections to it
were about *content* urls. Now by your own admission, you understand that
they are not post-processed, and so our objections to relative urls in
content are valid.

Now you are only talking about WordPress's own system urls and they are
generated on the fly anyway (which is why I say they change from
installation to installation), regardless of whether they are generated
with or without domains.

So I've remained quiet on this issue so far, but there's 2 separate things
being battled against here:
 1. Outputting relative links
 2. Transferring between multiple hosts using different domains.

Now, #1 is what people are suggesting is the "best" way to combat #2, that
being said, It's not the only method (Infact, there will be at least 4
different ways, My way, Your way, John Smith's way, and something which
no-one has yet thought of) and may not be the best or correct option.

To solve problem #2 above, most of us have been using such scripts which do
search/replace, the dumb scripts have always had issues with serialised
data, the smarter ones simple replace s:x:domain; with s:xx:longerdomain;
first, which works around the serialised issues.  That has "solved" the
issues related to transferring installs between domains.. But when it's not
a scripted migration, that type of search/replace is a somewhat cumbersome
process for some, and deemed too complex.

WordPress itself avoids storing the URL in the database *except* when used
within the post content, and the site/home url options obviously, AFAIK,
the domain should not be stored within the options table at all by
WordPress itself. So much so, that some images receive a url dynamically
generated upon post save and/or display (captions) so that value in the
database is irrelevant to the page display.

So now, we have 2 solutions:
 1. Output Relative links
 2. Search/Replace upon migration

Now lets look at the actual results with relative links, and what they give:
 * Url's become domainless
 * Url's still contain the path

This is a benefit to those who use dev.site.com, and site.com.
but it doesn't help those that use http://localhost/client-site and
client-site.com/  infact, if anything, it makes it harder.
If Relative url's are stored, now they're replacing /client-site/ with /..
Which at first doesn't seem like a huge problem, but then, when you broaden
your mind, you realise it's a much less strict search and replace, it'll
cause conflicts in more locations when the dev path is a common string..
which can be even worse when the "client-site" slug is used in the sites
content for more than just the url.

Relative links solve one problem, in one way, while having a knock on
effect to others, This is why I don't expect to see relative paths, such as
those being floated here, become the defacto storage for url's. Absolute
url's are just that, It's absolute as to their meaning, and easy to process.

So, moving on, Someone mentioned using a domain the same length, This
simplifies the search and replace methods, as you don't need to worry about
the serialised data.. but it's yet another work around.

We now have 3 different methods to solve the problem.  3 different methods
which will work for 3 different people.. but might not work for 3 others.

Now, I personally have never had a problem with the Search and replace
method, as the only location I ever have absolute url's to the current
site, is within the post content itself. no serialised data to deal with,
etc.

*So, a question*: Those of you who battle this out, where are the url's
that you have to alter, and that cause you so much apparent grief?
Is it Serialised data? (If so: Why is there a URL being stored anyway?
WordPress generates url's dynamically, and so should plugins/themes,
They're doing it wrong if they're storing a url in most cases..)
Is it Post Content?
Is it somewhere completely different?
Is it the WordPress Dynamically generated URL's on each page?


If I was dealing with a dev->staging->production setup, I know the exact
configuration I would have: ( NOTE: I'm NOT suggesting this for a simple
site-to-site transfer)
 * wp-config.php which dynamically loads wp-{$domaincontext}-config.php,
Allows me to have different Database details and WP_DEBUG etc based on the
context of the site being loaded
 * WP_SITEURL and WP_HOMEURL defined in above config files, You want to
specify what site is being loaded after all.
 * If multisite, there'll be a sunrise.php file in there to normalise the
hostname into the production hostnames to allow for correct domain lookup,
this shouldn't affect the links output by WordPress, rather just the domain
query process (Note: I haven't had to do this part, I know it's possible,
but I've never done it myself)
 * I'd be storing production url's in the database content, no mucking
around:
    * On insert on dev|staging: replace staging|dev url's with production
    * On retrieval on dev|staging: Replace production url's with
staging|dev depending on context
    * On insert on production: Nothing.
    * On retrieval on production: Nothing.
   This leaves the extra processing to take place on non-live servers,
somewhere where you can afford lower performance.

But there's a 2nd option as well, Instead of altering url's like that,
replace the urls on dev|staging|production:
 * On Insert: replace WP_SITEURL with [url] (a shortcode, remembering that
the constant is dynamically set depending on the current context)
 * On retrieval: Do nothing (Well, in the admin, you might need to apply
the shortcode manually for the editor..)
 * On Display: [url] shortcode is expanded to site_url()

That has the obvious downside that the shortcode needs to be processed on
the production server, on every page load, for every url in a post,
Congratulations, You've just solved a problem by including the production
server in the equation.. Whereas, with the previous suggestion, you're
offloading all extra processing to the development servers - where the
problem you're attempting to solve actually is.

*tl;dr:* Don't generalise problems, one solution will not fit the bill for
everyone, I've just gone over 5 different methods for site transfer, 2 of
which are specific to a staging environment, which will not work for
general site transfers, but vice versa, a general site transfer process is
also not aimed at a staging environment, they're 2 very different processes
which require different solutions.

I'm not trying to restart an opinion war, rather, I'm trying to gather
information, on why this specific implementation of relative url's is the
bee's knee's golden bullet which is going to solve every migration problem
people have, when In my mind, it solves a tiny fraction of the problem, for
a certain server environment, whilst leaving many others out in the cold..
I also didn't touch on SSL-ness of the request deliberately, things such as
the Google Pagespeed apache extension can kick in here, you can use
mod_substitution, or you can use extra processing power on your production
servers to replace http://domain with https://domain in your post content
before your caching layer kicks in (which, does support ssl/non-ssl caching
buckets right?)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Postformats vs Categories
Message-ID: <CAHERW=0XwcPCb6UP1u8+wFB2g222Fi2xZXVzbe7Gryu+VcUaWA@mail.gmail.com>

I know that the *main reason* post formats were added into the core
was the inter-operatibility between themes and providing some
standards across themes.  this way, one does not need to create a
"video" category - just to be able to display video posts differently
and tap into the post format video to achieve the same effect plus,
the ability to use other postformat aware templates without any
issues. i get that.


however,

if you do not care about the templates, ( that is you are managing a
highly complicated web site where no ready-to-go template is going to
help you and you are therefore using your own super-duper custom made
template ), then the question why care about the post-formats? I want
to make sure that if I refer to cats, wouldn't I  be better off using
categories as opposed to using post formats?

the reason I ask this is this...

post formats are limited to what comes with wp. I think they are
aside, status, .... and all together less than 10. And if you need
more post formats types for your specific case, you are out of luck.
but by using categories, you got no limitation. am I right?

the bottom line question is when template standartization is not an
issue., is there any harm using categories to address the post
formatting matters!

thanks

That was a really excellent post!  Lots of details and a valid attempt to view the issue from many different perspectives; kudos.

One of the things I think people for whom the current setup does not address their needs are yearning for is a (defacto-) standardized approach to the problem so that 1.) they don't each have to learn what works and what doesn't through trial and error, and 2.) that they can benefit from others working to improve the same process instead of each person haven't to perfect the process completely on their own.

In that vein I would ask, are there any things we can do to move the ball down the field, even if only by a little bit?

Let's use this as a starting point. I know Mark Jaquith has suggested this approach in the past. I think this can address all use-cases.  What does the hacker community think about baking this type of logic into /wp-load.php?  What about optionally loading a domain-specific file, if it exists, before loading wp-config.php?  

For example, if a browser requests http://example.com/ then /wp-load.php might look for ABSPATH . '/example.com-config.php' or  ABSPATH . '/../example.com-config.php' and load it if it exists?  It won't solve this root relative issue, but it will be a start?  (If this is not controversial I can add a trac ticket...)

And if this solves some problems, maybe we can then take more baby-steps to adding fixes that are not controversial that an empower more people to address their own needs?

There is nothing wrong with using categories, but if you want to outside the box you can create your own system of Post Formats easily with Custom Fields/Post Meta like people have been doing for years, to use categories like you mention, or you could use a custom taxonomy as the format. There are endless ways to do what post formats accomplish.

In it's current format, post formats are aimed to the entry blogger that frequently changes their theme. Like Custom post types are for not those users. And if you are not those users you can easily find enough code examples to work around it.

Post Formats are nothing more than a custom taxonomy with some fancy
template tags wrapped around it. If that taxonomy benefits your use-case,
then use it; but (especially in a client site) if that taxonomy does not
benefit your use-case, then don't use it.

Everything you can do with the Post Formats taxonomy, you can do with the
Category or Post Tags taxonomy, or with another custom taxonomy. (Consider
that, at least in part, the entire concept was born out of the Matala
Theme, that incorporated custom Loop output for the "gallery" and "aside"
categories.)

So, there's really no canonical right-or-wrong answer here; use what works
best for your use case, and for your users.

Subject: [wp-hackers] questioning the efficiency of using custom post types
Message-ID: <CAHERW=1JGNWFd-qsVmiY2C-CLOYW0qQ9ANU2DHGv3D3z2zUxjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Coming from a web application development background using ASP, I
found wp's way of handling the custom fields a little different and
inefficient. I may be wrong, so hence the post.

say, i need to build a web site that has tons of restaurant reviews.
in a typical web app, i would first create the restaurant table and
add all the fields i need it to describe a restaurant and go from
there.

So, as an example, I would add fields such as recID, rName, rAddress,
rOwner, rType, rThis, rThat...

And when I add a new restaurant, I just add 1 record into this table
and when I query that table, I can get all the info with a simple
select * from thatTable

Of course, this approach gives me a tremendous search and sort power as well.

now, if I were to do the same thing with WP, I would first create a
custom post type called restaurants and then add each and every field
that I need as a custom field. that needless to say bloats the
wp_post_meta table causing an exponential growth for every restaurant
added;

so if my restraurant type has 20 fields to describe it, I end up
creating 20 records into the  wp_post_meta. coupled with the original
wp_post entry, that would make 21 records.
whereas in the case of a custom restaurant table approach I described,
you only end up with 1 record!

this makes me think.. the more the restaurant entries, the less
efficient WP will get here...  and when it comes to do complicated
power searches against the restaurants such as find me all restaurants
whose field1=val1 and field2 contains val2 and so on, the effiicieny
will go out the window.

Of course, wp went along way with this structure/approach  because it
allows anyone and everyone to implement whatever the post type is to
get away with just two tables...  the wp_posts and the wp_post_meta
was enough for millions of people for all kinds of post types, and the
wp system works like a charm and I admire that.

my question is is this approach right for me ? can this be made more
efficient...

I have the following idea...  please feel free to give your opinion as
to why it would be good or bad...


* create a custom restraurants table into mySQL and add all the fields
you need into it.
* create php form letting you add/edit/delete restaurants...
* everytime you add a new restaurant into that mySQL table, also add a
programatic post entry into the wp_posts table ( using wp_insert_post)
relating to the corresponding restaurant from the mySQL table.
* make sure the wp_insert_post also creates/works with a custom field
called RestaurantID containing the recid value of the restaurant from
the restaurants SQL table.
* and when doing so, also store the perma-link search engine friendly
URL of that restaurant that wp will give you into the mySQL
restaurant's table...  maybe in a field called wp_URL in the
restaurants table.
* and just keep these two entries in sync for the field info that matters.

It appears to me, with this approach, I end up being more efficient because...

for every restaurant I add into the system, I end up adding only 3
records - that is true no matter how many fields the restaurant table
would require.

1 rec for the wp_posts table
1 rec for the wp_post_meta table for the custom field restaurant id
1 rec for the restaurant table that has all the needed fields to
describe a restaurant.

this way, I can land on a wp_post containing the restaurant info and
the content section contains a custom php code that paints the
restaurant info tapping into the mySQL restaurant table. ( in fact
with such an implementation, that SQL database does not even have to
be mySQL database, could perfectly be a Microsoft SQL )

and when  I need to perform a search, I can provide a wordpress page
containing a form allowing the user to do a power search against the
restaurant table any which way I like and sort the results in the
recordset accordingly, and then display it...
and when I display the results, I use the permalinks stored so that
each link lands back on a wp_posts table.

this way I achieve, all the interactivity, search engine optimization
and the power WP is famous for, but tap into a custom app
implementation where it matters.

what do you say about this approach?

more efficient?
totally useless?
already exists?

I'm still a bit confused.  Firstly, why do I need a the domain to have the
same length??  Since when does search and replace care about the relative
length of the strings?

Right, I was getting confused by the root part of root relative there.  I
was thinking that the images would be saved as
/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/29/my-images.jpg
and example.com/wp (my site address) would be prepended.  The proposal is
that for the purposes of content not being exported this wouldn't be
necessary.

Regardless it seems the correct thing for me to do is start using something
like dev.example.com instead of example.com/wp but if I did this it seems
like relative urls would still save me the find and replace step.  So I'd
still be in favor of an optional constant solution.

Search and replace is easy enough with a manual sql query but thanks.  The
process isn't that complex but it can be confusing to someone new to it so
I tend to think anything that make this initially daunting 16 step process
simpler seem like a good idea to me.

I've said it before but I deffinitely like the idea of having an optional
constant value that changes the behavior of the whole installation.  I'm
not sure exactly what that would look like or how to make the documentation
clear enough to be generally useful but I think in light of the fact that I
keep hearing that everyone does it slightly differently an optional tweak
like this could be quite helpful.

Message-ID: <CAHERW=2zmq+MfrrfmABsPSd_k5PkjiU0QGGnBA-J22wbfWbqkQ@mail.gmail.com>

please compare the two in terms of pluses and minues.

say Joe is in need of creating 10 top level categories plus 1
hierarchial custom taxonomy to have 5 sub-categories under it.
just when he is about to do so, George comes along and say, why not do
the following instead?

create that 10 top level as you intended to.
and instead of creating that extra custom taxonomy, just create
another top level category ( the 11th one ) and classify the posts
under that accordingly. Do your sub 5 cats under that 11th. And when
it comes to display or work with your categories , just treat that
category 11 different. display it when it is needed, and don't display
it when you don't. This approach would be better when querying...
because you would end up needing to tap into only one taxonomy system
( that is "category")  instead of two ( that is "category" plus "that
extra custom taxonomy".

http://ottopress.com/2010/wordpress-3-1-advanced-taxonomy-queries/
says the following;

Speed Concerns

Advanced taxonomy queries are cool, but be aware that complex queries
are going to be slower. Not much slower, since the code does attempt
to do things smartly, but each taxonomy you add is the equivalent of
adding a JOIN. While the relevant tables are indexed, joins are still
slower than non-joins. So it won?t always be a good idea to build out
highly complex queries.

Is joe or george right?

If george is right, shall we just say, why mess with hierarchial
custom taxonomies at all. just use them as tags to bring a law and
order to the tag soup as  the M. Fields nicely puts it here

After a week vacation in Orlando avoiding everything Internet. This was a great email to read. 

Yes, there are many plugins storing serialized domains. I may have done it without thinking myself. It is the biggest  stumbling block doing manual DB transfers.

For NEW sitebuilds the dev.example.com (as dev) and migrate to www.example.com (as live) is the methodology I've always used. Then before launch you migrate all files to your live server, run a simple find/replace on your db, edit hostfile to test, and you're done.

Is there a better way? I gotta admit I'm intrigued by Rafael's searchreplacedb.php solution, and will definitely be trying that on two sites I'm launching early this week.

That's right scribu, Pods does just that. Actually, in Pods 2.0 (alpha/
beta testing coming soon, seems like I've been saying that forever
now, but also seems like I'm getting delays thrown at me at every
corner too) we've added the ability to utilize Custom Post Types and
extend them to their own tables. It uses all the same WP functions you
would normally use, the data just lives somewhere else and you get the
huge benefit of the PHP classes we've got within Pods to do some
powerful lookups and such really easily.

Haluk,
One of the really non-intuitive things about relational DBs like MySQL is
that looking up data spread across more tables is less-efficient than fewer
tables with lots of rows. It got me at first too, but doing JOINs just
isn't fast, and more tables means more  For an example of how efficient
long tables like WPs are, take a look at Brett Taylor's documentation of
FriendFeed's speedup:
* http://bret.appspot.com/entry/how-friendfeed-uses-mysql

The longer tables also give us a lot of flexibility and prevent errors.
It's odd until you get to know MySQL, and the coding to deal with
meta-table isn't simple. And, since these things are already solved in
WordPress, it's also why we use WP over-and-over and why a lot of good devs
contribute to the project.


For an example of flexibility:
If you had a table of restaurants and later on you wanted to store extra
info about ones that served coffee, then... In a multi-table system you
could add columns to the restaurants table, or add a new table just for
those cafes. In a meta-table system you would add a meta-row and then add
the rows to the data table.

On a live site the multi-table changes could cause locking and performance
issues while they're happening, and they might leave you with either empty
columns for non-cafes or a whole other table to join in. On a live site
with the meta-tables the update would be the same as any other insert and
performance would be almost unchanged.

For an example of preventing errors:
Let's say you make some changes on your dev server and need to apply them
to the live site. On a multi-table system this could be adding columns or
adding tables. On a meta-table system this would be adding rows.

While the update queries run on the live site, the multi-table system could
return no data when queries see columns or tables "missing" because they
aren't added yet. The meta-table will return the "old" data, so there may
be missing fields, but no errors.

In the event someone makes a mistake in the update process (which happens
way more than it should, unless you're doing test-migrations and have
staging, test, pre-deploy and/or other versions of the site)... The
multi-table system will return errors to live users up until the mistake is
corrected. The meta-table system just leaves a few fields blank and (as
long as your devs are checking whether or nat a value exists) live site
visitors should just see some empty fields on the live pages.

I don't want to start a flame war, but, storing the data as key value pairs
defeats the whole purpose of using a relational database. If you want a K-V
store, then user a K-V store.

In general, Wordpress' approach works, because any given post meta table is
relatively short and/or the querying is of only modest complexity. However,
relational schema and normalization exists for a reason. Yes, they're
extremely complex and often overkill for a project. If you have large,
complex data, however, using a well normalized database will result in
significant speed improvements assuming that you need to perform arbitrary
queries over the data.

How's this apply to Wordpress? The K-V version of post meta doesn't scale
past a couple hundred million entries. Once this limit is reached, the fact
that a non-K-V data-store is being used causes the DB to fall over. In this
case, storing metadata in something more suited (such as a CouchDB or
Amazon SimpleDB) works far, far better.

~ Christopher

P.S. Before anyone takes me to task for this post, I *don't* think that the
WordPress core should change. As already stated for small to "modestly
large" amounts of data it works splendidly and does not require developers
to worry about the integrity or quality of their data model.

Because the serialize() PHP function used in WordPress, store the lenght of
the data, so you cannot *only* just search and replace.

You need to unserialize it first, replace and then serialize again! Got it!?

Scroll down to Serializing objects session:

And here: http://php.net/manual/en/function.serialize.php

I have had this argument on this list many times and in person with WP
core people.   I was told to my face, that they would never remove the
URLs from the content.

Here are my opinions.

1.  Everyone who is against relative URLs is just being obstinate
because they have defended their position so many times.

2.  People who say you just download the DB and change it have never
worked with a major client or done any enterprise development with
WP.  Some of my clients DBs are over 4GB.  It is a ton of fun to
reupload that.   Change the url via SQL breaks all the serialized
arrays with urls in it.

3.  The development > staging > production and review process is on of
the reasons I have started using Code Ignighter for my bigger
projects.   I had too many middle of the night deployment issues with
for my clients that require zero downtime.

4. The processor cycle argument is silly.   CPU is so cheap today.

I love wordpress and thank everyone for being helpful on this list,
but I can not understand why we can't just have the code use the
SITE_URL and let it be stored in one place.    Make it a config
value.  If you do not want to use it, you can ignore

The objections are just so weak, I assume it is just pride at this
point.

Pride or it wont be good for the WordPress.com .

If they really use wordpress.org latest software on that, maybe this change
of paradigm would totally bring a lot of problems to them!

Hence this difficult to change the direction of WordPress software on these
kind of issues.

Just a thought...

Because php serialzed data in the database (which many plugins store) that
contains the domain name will break if the length of the domain changes (as
it would with a dumb search and replace). There are several solutions out
there that claim to resolve the situation intelligently. I've not tried any
of them as I have a perfectly working solution I am comfortable with, but
many people can vouch for them.

Still, it's not going to happen any time soon for lots of very valid

Andrew, does it really matter either way? I mean, we all run sites and some of us run huge sites with massive content dependencies.  I've never run into a problem with the URL's being coding in the database despite having migrated million page sites so I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. If it is a huge issue for you, you can quickly run this code once (http://thisismyurl.com/6178/replace-absolute-urls-wordpress-database/) and solve your issue or include it as part of the edit_post hook and run it every time a post is saved.

Message-ID: <56FAF674-271F-476C-918A-6C67C0E106FD@getmoxied.net>

Hello WP Hackers,

I am in the process of setting up a development / hosting environment for all of the WordPress sites we develop and thought I could look to the community for some insight / options.   I have listed below what we currently have setup and would love some insight if I am headed in the right direction or if anyone can share their own experience. Having worked with WordPress for the past several years, we are now moving in the direction of solely working with WordPress as our go to platform and this is the first step.

We have recently moved over to using capistrano for deployment as well as git for version control.  We will be developing all sites locally then pushing to the server listed below.

At this stage I have:
Linode 512 LEMP Stack
Ubuntu 10.04
NGINX - 0.7.65
PHP 5.3.8
MySQL 5.1.41 

My thoughts for the remaining components:
Single install of WP to manage all sites (using symlinks to point to respective directories etc)
Using AWS for all static files
...would love to hear more insight / feedback / etc.

Thank you in advance,

That's a sweeping, nearly insulting, statement. People continue to defend
positions they believe in.

Also a sweeping statement. Perhaps more accurate might be to say "people
who have not had the problems you have experienced"

I have never had a serialized array break because of the precautions I take.

Here's a serious question: if a live site has grown to have 4GB of content,
why would you ever be uploading it back to live? Even in the circumstances
where I might take a copy of the live site to test something, I cannot
foresee the circumstances under which I would need to then upload that data
back to live.

Great. Use the best tools that do the job for you. That's what I do.



4. The processor cycle argument is silly.   CPU is so cheap today.

"If you do not want to use it, you can ignore" - If there is an option, the
code would have an additional check each and every time it came to output
content.

More silly statements. Your opinion is simply your opinion. One might say
the reason you don't see the other side of the argument is pride.

Message-ID: <CAEi=p53fgL-gRw690pX82vqR_g8kALnA9SwON6K1qQPtC1n_RQ@mail.gmail.com>

There's a free plugin I maintain that allows people to upload external
files to a WordPress installation.  It's meant to bridge the gap between
posts and exportable content (like PDFs and Word documents) by allowing a
site to host downloadable content.

Yesterday, I had a request from a user asking if the plugin allowed him to
search within his uploaded documents.  Basically, he wants the regular
WordPress search field to be able to search within PDF and DOCX files.  I
know there are some additional modules for PHP that will enable this ...
but I'm wondering if there's a way to programatically index the content of
uploaded documents that might be more readily available to a basic PHP
setup (like those common to people who host with GoDaddy, BlueHost, and the
like).

Does anyone have any experience extending WP's search functionality to
include the content of uploaded, non-DB housed documents?

Greetings all, just wanted to propose another option for exploring the technical distinctions between root relative and absolute urls.  Since it has been made clear here that a lot of people care passionately about each side of the coin, and that a lot of people don't care about the coin at all, I propose that we move the discussion to a different forum.  You don't have to participate, and if you want to continue participating here then you are of course at liberty to do so.  However for the sake of those who are sick of reading through novels of a discussion they don't care about (a good portion of wp-users) would everyone mind moving the discourse to here?

    http://groups.google.com/group/absolute-vs-relative/

It will allow us to discuss details about the two perspectives without hijacking this mailing list, which I admit I started.  Had I known it would get this out of hand I would have started with a different forum to begin with.

Mike, I would really appreciate your input there.  I know you have a deep understanding of the wordpress core, and I think you would be the best candidate for pointing out the problems with root relative urls.  If at the very least, I would like to discuss our last topic as I have discovered how wordpress does actually change content urls in addition to system urls.  I'd like to hear your perspective on this and what implications it has on converting to root relative urls that do not need the change.  I also sent you an email via zed1.com, with my personal email address if you'd rather discuss via direct email.

Otto, I would appreciate hearing your input too. I know we got out of hand on Friday and I truly am sorry that happened.  I'm sure you will see a different side of me in further discussions and would like to hear your feedback as one of the few avid supporters that spoke up yesterday.

To everyone else, again I'm sorry to have opened Pandora's box, in addition to heating up the dial in my retorts.  As a pragmatist, I'm attempting to restore peace on this forum with a solution that should solve everyone's needs.

Thanks again for everyone's support, input and honest criticism.  I have learned a lot about the group and wordpress in just a few days and I promise to be as supportive as I can in the future.

Btw, I have updated the two plugins to support < php5.3 installations.  So if you were experiencing activation problems before they should be resolved entirely in the latest version.  (it still shows v1.0, a mistake on my part for not updating the right field, but it is updated I promise :D)

Best Regards,
Marcus Pope.

Also a sweeping statement. Perhaps more accurate might be to say "people who have not had the problems you have experienced"

I have never had a serialized array break because of the precautions I take.

Here's a serious question: if a live site has grown to have 4GB of content, why would you ever be uploading it back to live? Even in the circumstances where I might take a copy of the live site to test something, I cannot foresee the circumstances under which I would need to then upload that data back to live.

Great. Use the best tools that do the job for you. That's what I do.

More silly statements. Your opinion is simply your opinion. One might say the reason you don't see the other side of the argument is pride.

Ignoring the specific issue begin debated, to argue against something in WordPress "Because it requires an additional check each and every time it comes to output" is just, well, silly.

Are you planning to manage all your clients sites on a single install, or did I misunderstand?

Can you clarify what you mean by a custom taxonomy with 5 sub-categories?  Do you mean a custom taxonomy like "Color" with "Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow" and "Cyan" or do you mean something else?  (Providing example data would really help.)

Last year I wrote a plugin for a client which indexes the contents of
PDFs uploaded into WordPress. It uses one of the many PDF to text PHP
classes available [1]. We had mixed results with its reliability and
accuracy. For example, it's not always possible to extract text from
PDFs created in certain PDF applications, and others may give text all
squished together without spaces where you might expect. Different PHP
classes for the text extraction probably give different results.

Integrating the PDF text extraction with WordPress was simply a case
of hooking into the 'update_attached_file' hook and creating a post
containing the PDF's text which is then searchable as usual in
WordPress. If you're interested in the plugin feel free to email me
off-list.

Others may have different opinions but I would worry that you'd end up creating dependencies for all your clients sites by the weakest link of one of your client's site.  If you add a plugin for one client you could end up breaking all client's sites (unless you are running Multi-site, more on that below.)  

While it can simplify some things I think you'd be better off running separate installs for your separate clients, identifying what other issues you'll need to manage and then coming up which processes to manage those issues instead. Otherwise all your client's sites will be coupled and single points of failure (such a code hack) will be able to bring down everyone's site. Of course, that's my just current opinion.

-Mike
P.S. Note for fans of Multisite: In the case of one client who needs many sites, or one company offering sites to people who sign up for multi-tentant architecture Multisite is a great solution.  But I'm assuming Jeffrey's company Moxie Media Group is an agency producing fully customized sites each with different sets of plugins for different clients, and I'm thinking Multisite is probably not the best solution. Again, others may have different opinions and if so I'd welcome learning about the success of those approaches that may differ from mine.

Mike I agree with your perspective on multi-site.  We too are a an agency group that produces work for a variety of clients.  Besides multi-site not having the best isolation between sites in some regards (administration needs to be well maintained to prevent network enabling plugins & themes across the board.) it will also produce a data backend that is incongruent with a single install if they choose that design down the road.  The backend can be restructured to work but you'd need custom migration scripts to handle table renames and value updates.

We currently use a hybrid approach of using a multi-site system to manage our content only, but we then export to single installs that are fully customized per client.

Jeffrey, you could get away with just working from one install, and having build scripts manage the symlinks.  But wordpress does offer a very robust upgrade system so unless you plan on managing dozens of installs at once, you'll probably not see much benefit from reducing that process down to one install.  And in the infrequent case that an upgrade to wp core does break an existing site/feature, you'll appreciate the fine-grain control on when to do the upgrade for each client.

As for integrating AWS for media, I don't have much experience with it inside the wordpress environment.  I know there are a couple plugins for streaming media, but I'm not sure how broad the support is for other media items. Or whether they natively integrate with the wordpress editor or just offer shortcodes.  Maybe someone else can fill you in on that.

Thanks,
Marcus

References: <mailman.7604.1320013418.1433.wp-hackers@lists.automattic.com>
Message-ID: <4EAE01F2.8070705@gmail.com>

I know there is this absolute-vs-relative url debate going on here and 
I've learned quite a bit about the subject and more importantly, about 
the community.

Anyway, this is my problem: I have a testing server, 2 actually - 
http://wp.dev/ (localhost) and http://dev.example.com/ to host my 
project sites

when working on client projects I create a new subdirectory under the 
above domains so that the root to the new development site becomes 
http://wp.dev/projectname/ and http://dev.example.com/projectname/ and 
install wordpress from there. And for people who still don't get what 
I'm trying to do here, to view a page, I access it now through 
http://wp.dev/projectname/about-page/

Now, to link to my assets (css, js, images) I currently do <?php echo 
get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/css/base.css or something like that 
which prints out an absolute url.  Now I have no problem with that or 
with doing that for my wp projects.

My issue is when I have to create non-wp sites like say static pages. 
for linking to assets, I have to spell out the whole url or at least do 
something like
/projectname/css/style.css then, when I need to upload it to the final 
server, i have to change the urls now to /css/style.css

So my question, what do i need to do so that in my pages, all I need to 
write for my url is /css/style.css and it'll work if I put that in 
http://wp.dev/projectname/ and http://dev.example.com/projectname/ and 
on http://www.projectname.com/ or basically no matter where i put it.

I did not really see the value in using Multi-Site for our purposes and it sounds like you have shed some more light on why.

My main reasoning for using one install was to save time for upgrading as we may be managing dozens of sites.  In the past year I would say we developed 20+ WP sites, after a while managing those types of upgrades could turn out to be painful.  My main idea for this came from viewing the way Debian's Maverick WordPress package is configured, essentially you create a new wp-config file for each domain and when updating you update your core files in one location.  This sounds attractive to me as we will be able to update all the sites we manage at once instead of 1 by 1.  Our plan is to have fail safe tools (error logs, link checking, etc) in place in the event the site does have an error or goes down so we can remedy the issue immediately.

It seems AWS will mainly serve as a CDN for all of the sites we build.  This plugin seems like it does what we will need, I was mainly seeing if anyone had thoughts on this.

I am just mainly trying to develop a system that is secure, fast and easy to maintain.

Does anyone have an environment like this setup that can shed more light on this?

Thanks again,

Jeff

You could look at ManageWP.com to help with managing many sites, or if you choose to go that route I want to see a case study 6 months from now telling us how well it works and if you are still using that approach. :-)

I doubt that this wasn't an intentional spur, and probably one worth 
discussing, however:

More importantly than absolute vs relative is that many people don't 
want to write HTML at all. Which although there is a visual editor for 
that, is a near requirement to understand at least the basics of HTML. 
This is a limitation upon the number of people who are willing to even 
learn how to use WordPress. Media by at large is a weak point because of 
the complexities of doing video, audio and photography. This can all be 
handled along side WordPress that doesn't require changes to the core 
editor that is very much defined and should remain unchanged.

There is one crowd that is more towards just writing HTML, there is 
entirely and much larger crowd that doesn't even know HTML. Thus using 
WordPress is a beginning step to learning and why having both the visual 
and code editor is important. WordPress has been user-centric and not 
developer centric which is why it has been popular. However WordPress 
lacks a lot of the object oriented abstraction that frameworks (designed 
by developers) have, that can make it frustrating to work with at times, 
especially in a highly instable environment such as doing development. 
Yet the very flexibility of frameworks such as Django, making it 
impossible to maintain any project outside a single use very well 
because the models are always changing, and are just plain annoying.

The fact that there needs to be a search and replace with the same 
length of the domain is a workaround, and while it is a solution, and 
probably the best one considering the most common environment and use of 
WordPress and emphasis on portability of posts and you don't know where 
they well be read. This so super important. Yet it still isn't an 
entirely good solution either, and turns many developers away because of 
the "uncomfortable" experience.

I'm really surprised markup languages haven't become more common 
actually, like Wikipedia uses. I feel more comfortable teaching someone 
who doesn't know HTML a markup language than HTML because although HTML 
is very simple, it's also really easy to mess up.

Hi Jeff,

Have you looked into doing like a semi-symlinked install? symlink 
wordpress core files/directories (wp-includes, wp-admin) but have 
wp-content separate for each client. What I did was to setup one 
"master" site from which to symlink the needed files/directories to.

For plugins, I have a set of common plugins in the "master" site then 
create a symlink from each needed plugin to the plugin directory in each 
client site. Client specific plugins are of course added here too. This 
setup allows me to have different sets of plugins for each client while 
still running wp core on one install. Remember wp-content directory on 
the client site is not a symlink. Only the common individual plugins are.

But, please note, I'm only doing this in my development server. For 
production sites, I still have them running on separate installs.

Would love to hear how this goes for production setups (6 months from 
now) if you do decide to go with my suggestion.

At first glance that sounds good and all, but do you really want to be
calling your files wp-development.funclientsite.com-config.php ? What about
when paths are thrown into the mix?
wp-config.php is a php include line any other, it doesn't *have* to contain
any definitions at all, it can simply be a switch/if and include the
specific file for that instance. That's exactly what I've seen some
large-scale installations use, it's one of the things that everyone can do
themselves anyway they please, as it'll vary on each individual
configuration (domain names, environments, VCS in use, if it's their
fulltime site, or only a quick contract job, etc)
Something like this would do it:
wp-config.php: if ( 'blah.com' == HTTP_HOST ) include
'wp-production-config.php'; else include 'wp-development-config.php';

Yep, _doing_it_wrong().
So in that case,
 * If it's a file, page, post, etc that's being referenced to, the PostID
should be stored instead of the url, what if the slug gets updated on the
page? (or parent changes, etc)
 * If it's a link to an off-site site, well, it doesn't matter, it can
stay-as-is.
 * If it's a link to a page/post and is designed for easy insert by the
user, there's 2 options:
   1. Do a lookup on the url and retrieve the post ID, and store that (This
is easily done)
   2. do a str_replace on the domain component and prefix later.. if it's a
problem in the environments its designed for
   3. Consider that's is a necessary evil, and will have to live like that.
 bonus: If the plugin doesn't have many options, consider that it could be
stored as it's own string in the options table.. removes the serialised
problems.

Ultimately however, if a plugin is in use which stores the url's like that
in the database, you're just going to have to alter it when you move the
site anyway, there's nothing WordPress can do really that's going to
reliably solve it for everyone in that case..

WordPress.com's usage of WordPress isn't really going to impact upon this
at all, WordPress.com runs a customised version of WordPress, many .org
functionalities are disabled, many additions have been added, as much as
some people won't agree with me saying this: Automattic/WordPress.com
doesn't direct the way WordPress.org project runs.
However, that being said, WordPress.com has some of the brightest people
I've met working on it, they've battled it out against many problems which
more-than-single-site installs have come up against, they're aware of the
issues with caching for millions of installs, they have the experience. and
because of that I will trust their opinions on how to most efficiently
implement something over a developer who's experience I'm unsure of any
day.. just the same as I'll trust their experience on what to cache over
what I would cache.. since I don't have that same level of optimization
skillset (ie. CPU Cycles might be cheap, but I'll still attempt to avoid
them in many cases)

Hey Ryann, I would suggest that you always use /css/base.css. Then on your dev and staging site I would use an .htaccess rewrite rule that checks for the project name at the start of the request_uri. If it's not there rewrite the url with it prepended at the start. Since .htaccess files have access to environment variables you could even make it controlled by code in the wp_config.php file so you wouldn't have to create a new custom .htaccess file for every project. 

Alternatively you could add a custom rewrite rule in wordpress itself. The wordpress rewrite api http://codex.wordpress.org/Rewrite_API is fully capable of handling this scenario as well, though performance would be faster in mod_rewrite (.htaccess). This api is how wordpress maps urls like /year/month/day to the correct file, as you probably already know there is no actual file for such a url. Considering this is the premise for 90% of the urls processed by the core it is still suitable for your situation. And for dev environments the performance loss is probably not noticeable. 

That way when you switch to production everything will work without the specialized rules and you will have zero performance loss along with zero refactoring costs. 

Hope that helps, if you have questions about specifics just ask!

Sure I do.  Why not?   

We have /wp-admin/includes/class-wp-comments-list-table.php, is the above any worse?

(Actually, I have the good sense not to create such crazy long domains for development; I would use "funclientsite.dev." But I digress. :)

Yep. I was just trying to propose moving toward some standard so that everybody who is not highly experienced with WordPress doesn't have to go through the pain of figuring out what works and what doesn't.

I know how do it it; I'm just trying to look out for those who don't.

> That's exactly what I've seen some large-scale installations use,

Then why not come up with a standard that is simple for basic cases but scales up to handle more complex cases?

-Mike
P.S. BTW, if you'd rather take the position that it's not possible to create something that works well for everyone (which is something I've often heard over the year from people about technology solutions, until a competitor shows them that it can be done) then so be it; I don't have time or energy to fight for this, again I was just trying to be helpful for the benefit of others.

Hi Ryan,

This is exactly what I planned on doing, the only difference would be to use s3 for all document / media storage.  This is the same way the Ubuntu packages come and it got me thinking that this may be the best way to go about it.  We have 2 projects starting this upcoming week and we will be using the method you described with some slight modification.  I will be sure to report back with any progress I make with this system.

Thank you,

Jeff

Lets work on the 80:20 rule then, and further the 95% rule. 80% of people
will never need staging configs, and of those 20% 95% will never use it
either.
The remaining 1% of users who might have the need to do it, would be far
better off served with a codex article discussing the potential directions
one can go in. Every developers environments and way that they're
comfortable with doing it is going to differ, The difference between
staging sites and production sites might not be the HTTP host, it could be
a different server (with the same domain name.. ie. via a VPN/proxy or
similar), or it could even be running on a different port (I've seen it - a
load balancer switched the ports depending on the source being a internal
proxy)

tl;dr: Core can do it, core can standardise on it; but those that do it are
in a miniscule minority, and overall, it feels better as a community edited
wiki instructions.

P.S. Like I said, I don't have the energy or the time to debate this further.

Why not just add that logic into your wp-config.php itself?

I mean, the wp-config.php file isn't really part of WordPress, and it
doesn't get overwritten on upgrades. So you can put any code you want
right at the top and have it include arbitrarily named files as you
see fit.

Why add Post Formats to WordPress core? Practically anyone can do the same with a custom taxonomy. Aye, the value of post formats is not in the implementation, its in the standard.

Hi Marcus, thank you for replying. I'm interested in the .htaccess 
rewrite rule. How do I write it? I tried the following:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/testproject/
RewriteRule ^wp\.dev/(.*) http://wp.dev/testproject/$1

references:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2982205/using-htaccess-rewrite-to-make-a-subdirectory-be-its-own-root-for-root-relative
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4844069/htaccess-rewritebase

I'm fine with just the .htaccess solution

I don't know mod_rewrite very well although I'm getting the hang of 
writing simple regex patterns.

Thanks so much!

Then on your dev and staging site I would use an .htaccess rewrite rule that checks for the project name at the start of the request_uri. If it's not there rewrite the url with it prepended at the start. Since .htaccess files have access to environment variables you could even make it controlled by code in the wp_config.php file so you wouldn't have to create a new custom .htaccess file for every project.

The wordpress rewrite apihttp://codex.wordpress.org/Rewrite_API  is fully capable of handling this scenario as well, though performance would be faster in mod_rewrite (.htaccess). This api is how wordpress maps urls like /year/month/day to the correct file, as you probably already know there is no actual file for such a url. Considering this is the premise for 90% of the urls processed by the core it is still suitable for your situation. And for dev environments the performance loss is probably not noticeable.

Different case that I don't think applies here. The value isn't in the
standard, because you're talking about loading custom configuration,
which is inherently non-standard.

You're wanting a way to load different configs based on parameters
which will very likely be specific to your own setup. Anything core
does in this regard isn't going to match your setup or needs
precisely. And realistically, you're not talking about some epic level
of code here. You're basically wanting to get the domain name,
probably from the $_SERVER variable somehow, then to check for a file
and include it if it exists. Like, probably 3 lines of code, but code
which is going to be customized or different for any given
individual's setup/workflow/design-pattern/etc...

Custom configuration is exactly what the wp-config.php file is there
for. It doesn't have to be just a few simple settings. I've setup many
sites with some varied wp-config.php files in there for various
reasons. Having it include some other file is not strange.

Thank you for the invitation, you honour me, but I have no time nor
interest in debating in support of the status quo that I happen to agree
with.

But I'll leave you with this thought: we, hackers and developers on this
mailing list, are a tiny, tiny, minority of WordPress users. And WordPress
is a user's tool first and foremost. I agree with that and it should not
change.

It doesn't matter if something that we developers have to do to move a site
to live, or to publish a new version of a site for client approval, is
awkward, or takes more steps than would be ideal, or even is prone to
errors; the guiding light for core functionality in WordPress is the users
and the user experience.

I whole-heartedly support that. So anything that makes it harder for users;
whether another choice to make, another configuration option, or a more
cpu-expensive operation is more than likely to be considered a bad move.

So Otto - you cleary have no concept of heavy enterprise development. 
Here's the process:

- Account owner  / client asks for new section of website, or changes to 
current website
- DEV team (either in-house, or often in Enterprise, outsourced to a 
development agency) make said changes.
- Account owner / client will then need to review the change and approve 
it ready to go live (this person is very often non-technical, and in an 
Enterprise environment, so you can't start asking HOST file changes or 
DNS changes)
- DEV team then make said change live
- Account owner then approves change is live.
- Job is closed.

Sometimes we need to do this with time-delays etc ... when launching a 
specific product for a client, with new features etc ...

***IMPORTANT***

Can the list confirm two things then please?

1) WordPress is not looking to improve on Enterprise support as it's too 
small a use case? If so we'll start looking at more "grown-up" platforms 
for our clients.

2) If WordPress is so concerned about the DB content being "excatly" 
what you entered, why is there a filter that changes my Wordpress to 
WordPress (even in URLs that can be case-sensitive)?

Message-ID: <4EAE8BA6.2040404@braydon.com>

More than two years ago I was working on a plugin for HTML5 video for 
WordPress, so don't hold it against me since. I've since not maintained 
it. However I wanted to draw some attention to it in hope that someone 
is interested to refresh it, and bring in their own experience.

It's not in the WordPress repository because it didn't feel it was 
appropriate since it's not exactly very friendly to use. It requires an 
FFMPEG custom compiled for the for the MP4 part, in addition to 
FFMPEG2Theora. It's possible also support WebM which has become 
available, but isn't setup for that currently.

I'm bring this up now because I've just realized that HTML5 videos are 
showing up as video in search results, and there are lot of benefits 
other than ethics. Such as video that works across feed readers, in 
addition to mobile (no flash), and HTML5 video just plays so much 
smoother, and resumes to the correct time when navigating away and back 
to the page. Small things.

My only suggestion is to decide promptly what are you going to do:
1. write code
2. manage/host environments

Because if you are doing #1, it's easy, just go with whatever setup you 
want as Mike suggested, separately in case of every client. When it 
comes to production deployments, get a cloud solution like pagodabox.com 
and "give the keys to the client".
The reason I suggest this, is because usually, you will need to scale 
and optimize after some time, and once again, if you are going to do #1 
you will need to solve problems your team wasn't hired to solve (and 
will usually ain't going to solve those very well).

But if you are going with #2, I would start by reviewing the hosting 
provider and resources you plan spending on that. After what, hire a 
good sysadmin (start with a part time collaboration if needed) that will 
be able to assist you any time in such questions.

The problem here is that a lot of people think that hosting WordPress is 
that easy (buy a vps and `apt-get install _l(n/a)mp_`). The short story 
is that if it was like that, companies like Automattic and Page.ly would 
never existed. That's why *it's wrong* to think so.

Good luck!

Message-ID: <CAHZK5OaQqYNi7y+NfeXfah0+X09qi5vyEm8_tu+SowcqZQijJg@mail.gmail.com>

If your WP install uses authentication other than the wp-login page,
I'd love to be able to hide the wp-login.php file.  I've tried
renaming it but it seems that the core code requires that name for the
admin login to still work.  I don't want to hack code, so the first
thought is to create a plugin that would let me change wp-login to
"bananas.php" or something.  Especially after seeing a 3 minute demo
of WPScan, I'd love to make it harder for anyone to scan my
installation and possibly get the admin account.  My thought is if
they don't find wp-login.php, they'll get bored quickly and go on to
one of the other millions of installs that have it.

It just seemed that the filename wp-login.php was so interwoven in
core code that there was no easy way to change the filename.

If it can't be done by a plugin, is this something the core team would
consider making into a variable and letting the admin set the name of
the login page?

Thanks.

Mike,

That could be any hierarchy that provides a different facet into the
content. I was imagining that the first 10 cats are the categorization
of one facet and the final one ( the one that was being questioned  to
 be  implemented as a CT ) is another facet. An example could be
something like this...

when the top ten cats are as follows;
*   topic1
*   topic2
*   topic3
..
*   topic10
which could be stuff like sports, politics, entertainment... they are
part of basically form a group of a topic based categorization. Let's
call it topic based facet, and this would allow the site to be browsed
by topic.

and the 11th cat, ( the one that I was asking about whether it should
be implemented as another cat, or a CT ) would be looking at things
from another point of view (say media), so that the site could be
browsed by media type. in that case, it could be sub categorized as
follows

video
audio
article
application
animation

Now the question is, would you create a CT and name is at Media and
then create these 5 under it as subs...

or

just create another category right after the topic10 and call it
topic11 ( that is media ) and tuck 5 more underneath it as 11.1 being
video... 11.5 being animation etc.

the issue of treating the cat 11 differently is due to the different
nature of the cat11.

when you display the cats, of course, you would not want to display it
as politics, sports, entertainment and then boom media (cat11)...
why? cause media is a whole different facet...

we can extend this to another facet, for example audience...  which
lets site to be browsed by the proficiency level of the user as well..
  let's say we now need to consider topic12 or perhaps another CT
called Audience. And we break it down by beginner, intermediate and
advanced...

again, you would not want to display it as politics, sports,
entertainment and then media and then audience... the media, the
audience and the first ten belongs to different sets... different
facets...

here what I'm trying to understand is.... as I create more and more
CT's, my JOINs will be slower and slower...  so should I stay away
from creating CT's after CT's just because it makes more sentence for
them to be as CT's ?... should I concern about the speed and implement
an the alternative way of achieving the same thing by strictly using 1
taxonomy that is category? For a small blog or one that do not have a
big hierarchy, these questions don't matter much. but the more the
hierarchy, the more these questions become...  eventually each of
these would lead top its own "landing page" where you need to do lots
of filtering from various facets...  for example, breaking the
politics category by audience and media facets...  or breaking it
videos facet by topics and audiance... when we create those loops
speed would be a matter to question.. it just looks to me if you never
create CT's, you are just better of with speed!  Again, this is based
on the Otto's article that I referred above..  In that article, hw
wasn't saying to never use CTs but speed wise,  I understood that it
is better to stick to less taxonomies...

may be the right question I'm trying to ask, in a highly complicated
web site with 5000 videos, 20,000 articles, 1M plus visitors where
visitors are from all knowledge levels ( beginner/intermedia/advanced)
and so on....  what guide does the information architect use in
deciding when to use CT's and when not to - where we know the CT that
you are trying to create can just as well be implemented as another
top level category whose display is managed properly.

Wow, this debate is still raging, huh?

I've seen a handful of graceful, automatable suggestions for creating dev-staging-production solutions, and still "team-enterprise" is pushing for inclusion in core. What, exactly, is wrong with a plugin? It's precise definition (a set of software components that adds specific capabilities to a larger software application) is a perfect fit for this case.

Consider the enterprise must-have plugins that already exists:

-Domain Mapping (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/)
-Bad Behavior (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bad-behavior/)
-WordPress SEO (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/)

IMHO, it makes far more sense to develop use-case-specific plugins than to offer a few "common" choices in core. Since there are at least a few pro-root-relative hackers in the conversation right now, why don't you folks band together to help support and extend Marcus' plugin?

Hi all,

The project I'm working on requires an 'activity stream' of WordPress posts
to be updated live, via Ajax.

I've read a lot about long polling, Comet etc. but I've found it hard to
replicate. The code I'm using now essentially polls WordPress every 10
seconds to check if there are new posts, and then appends them to the top of
a list. This can't be very efficient, as most of the time the response from
the server will be null.

How have people achieved long-polling, or any other more efficient method to
create live streams with WP?

For reference, I have posted the code I'm using below. It's pretty simple
(but any improvements to what I have are welcomed!)

Cheers,
Alex

Alex,

If you're using a typical WordPress installation (i.e. shared host or no
access to the server environment), long polling is probably the best you
can accomplish.  Read up on the thread we we covered last month regarding a
similar situation - I wanted to use WebSockets to stream WP data to the
front end (
http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2011-September/040806.html)

The system I'm working on now, and hope to demo in a couple of weeks, is
still built on WordPress, but uses some additional technologies to make
websockets possible.  Firstly, I switched my server environment from Apache
to Nginx so I could more effectively handle events without blocking the
current request thread.  I'm also building a custom Node.js application to
sit alongside my WordPress installation and serve up data.  This way,
websocket requests will be handled by the separate Node application, which
will be tied in to post publication/update hooks on the server end.

We actually need to do 1 and 2 as we will be managing these sites for our clients.  My thoughts are not that WP hosting is that easy hence my constructing these email to get some insight.  In the event we need to hire someone to help out with the management of the servers we will do so, at this point I think it will be a slow process and in the meantime we can learn some of the ins and outs of hosting WordPress.  I should have mentioned that this is more for a team rather than one person.  

Thanks for your insight, I have checked out Pagoda box and awaiting an invite, I am sure this may be able to help me with my decision.

Thanks again!

What, exactly, is wrong with a plugin? It's precise definition (a set of software components that adds specific capabilities to a larger software application) is a perfect fit for this case.

I'm not taking a public position on the URL debate, but I will say that a plugin requires everyone to rediscover what works and what doesn't and the lack of standardizations means everyone who is working on the problem is working on a proprietary vs. a shared solution. Yes that's okay for "Yet Another Related Posts" plugin, but IMO not okay for a deployment solution.  

It's things like this that enable the Drupal folks to still have viable reasons why people should choose Drupal over WordPress (vs. the billion other reasons people should usually choose WordPress over Drupal.)

On this we disagree.  (Isn't the first time that's happened. Won't be the last either. :-)

There are not an infinite number of ways to set things up. There are standard patterns we could identify and address, if people were open to it.

To me that statement could not be more ironic.  If it's not an epic level of code, then why not standardize it?   (That's a rhetorical question because I know you are against it so I know you'll find a reason not to...)

There is no need for a foreach() in programming languages because for() suffices.  But language designers recognize there is a common pattern and rather than force the developer to be potentially tripped up by off--by-1 errors and to always need to index into the array language designers realized there was benefit to adding a higher level feature.

Yes, we can leave the burden of many things to the developer, but when a pattern can be identified and it is only "probably 3 lines of code" it seems either short-sighted or sadistic not to evolve WordPress to remove said burden from the developer, just like adding Post Formats removed that burden for their use-case.

BTW, as an example of value, Alex King's Post Format Admin UI plugin[1] wouldn't have near the value it does if everyone were having to hack together their own solution for post formats. Having people build knowledge of a deployment standard in plugins and themes would have significant benefit, but nobody is going to do it without core standardizing it.

I am not an ops guy, but I think there is a workable solution to be had.

I would build the dev environment around vagrant (http://vagrantup.com).
Basically you can include your dev environment in the code repo letting you
start up a new dev envrionment as easily as

git clone git:example.com/clientfoo.git
cd clientfoo
vagrant up

and boom your dev environment is up and running. You should be able to
write your dev scripts such that it will grab the latest mysql backup from
the client so you should be good (media might be an issue but I think using
something like S3 for uploads would work... or just copy the contents of
the upload directory).  This github project includes a vagrant setup for
wordpress so it might be worth looking at:
https://github.com/iteh/vagrant-demos

One of the nice things about vagrant is that its built largely using either
Puppet (http://puppetlabs.com/)or Chef (http://www.opscode.com/chef/) to
get things setup and you can use those same scripts to build your
production environments.

I can't vouch for this myself, but it seems to me to be the way to go.

I totally understand Mike.  It's a shame though because I think through discourse we could find out which option really adds overhead to the system.  And really I was hoping to find out more about what makes it harder for the users when root-relative urls are in use.  I have heard regular users complain about this core aspect, not just us developers which is why I wrote the plugin.  Ultimately I'll be left with writing up a synopsis of how I see your side's perspective versus getting the information directly from the source.  And there are not many out there who are as familiar with the codebase and supportive of absolute urls that are also willing to discuss it as thoroughly as you have.  Maybe a little compensation for your time would be in order for such input, or perhaps not even a debate, but a flushed-out, one-page-perspective on the topic.

I agree that as developers we should take extra steps to make the end-user's life easier.  I agree that if that process were complex but the end-user's life were easier it would be worth it.  I just don't know how root-relative urls make the end-user's life more difficult and that was the information I was seeking from your side of the table.  Maybe you'll come around one day in some spare time, maybe not.  I have transferred all of the points that I found in this thread and others over to the Google group, and will continue to search for other reasons you and others have provided for such a design decision.  I appreciate the effort you have put into the discussion thus far.

@Dagan Henderson - yeah I'm sorry to see it continue here, though I'd say it's far less raging that it was on Friday :D  To answer your question as concisely as possible, this problem is not solvable via a plugin for multi-site and the overhead it adds to vanilla installs is significant as a plugin because the URLs get transformed twice, sometimes three times over instead of zero times that could be possible with a core architecture shift.  I'm working with the core committers to add filters to make the multi-site option feasible, but imo it's a step in the wrong direction.  I'm still in search of what harm the step in the other direction would be.

Thanks again everyone!

Hey Ryann, unfortunately I got sucked into a 6 hour meeting in the next 10 minutes so I won't be able to write up a response as complete I would like.  But I can fill you in on more details tomorrow if you don't figure out an option from this response.

Basically you are 90% of the way there.  I'm not sure if the email thread removed the newline, but you'll want to put the RewriteRule on its own line underneath the RewriteCond statement.  You can also take out http://wp.dev and just use /testproject/$1.  And additionally you will want to put [R=301,L]  which indicates that the redirect is a permanent move (301) and to stop processing anymore rules L == Last Rule.

Otherwise the rest looks good.  If the above suggestions don't work out let me know and I'll spend a little more time looking at it.  Here's a formatted version for you to view.. 

RewriteEngine on

#be sure to include the wordpress .htaccess rules here

#and put this at the bottom of your file
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/testproject/ 
RewriteRule ^wp\.dev/(.*) /testproject/$1 [R=301,L]

#end of file

Thanks!

Hi Marcus, thank you for replying. I'm interested in the .htaccess rewrite rule. How do I write it? I tried the following:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/testproject/ RewriteRule ^wp\.dev/(.*) http://wp.dev/testproject/$1

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4844069/htaccess-rewritebase

I'm fine with just the .htaccess solution

I don't know mod_rewrite very well although I'm getting the hang of writing simple regex patterns.

Thanks so much!

Patrick,

Forgive my hacker-ish method of replying to your question.
I am mucho new to the wp core. But I am capable of running a few experiments.

auth_redirect() is the main function that handles the stuff you want
to deal with.
It checks authentication then redirects to the login if necessary.

This function is found in wp-includes/pluggable.php

This is a pluggable function. I put together a fast plug in and found
that I could easily redirect to bananas.php

What ramifications would this have?
How does this relate to the setup process?
What kind of admin page would be required to manage the name of the
wp-login.php?
What goes on during (after) wp upgrade?

Proving that "something" is possible is easy. Finding an elegant and
well thought out solution that anticipates the multitude of issues
that could come from this is not so easy. Hats off to the guys and
gals that code at that level.

If you want to hack a quirky solution together for your own website
that might work okay. You'll have to tweak it after each wp upgrade.
(copying the new wp-login.php into bananas.php, and checking code in
auth_redirect to make sure your plugin is up to date.)

If you want a plugin that can be added to the repository, I think
you'd have quite a bit of work ahead of you.

However, I did notice that the function wp_login_url has a filter.
Maybe life will turn out to be as simple as writing a filter into the
theme. But then again, you have the same admin issues to deal with
when a wp upgrade comes along.

Regards,
Claude Needham

Thanks Claude.

One thing I don't want is a redirect.  I saw the WPScan tool in action
today and one thing that it looks for is wp-login.php.  So my thought
was to change the name of that file.  If something on the server
simply redirects to bananas.php, then that defeats the purpose.

Currently I have an multi-user/multi-blog install that hundreds of
people use, but only I use the wp-login.php.  So I would be fine with
making that login page completely obscure.

Thanks for a response!

Patrick

This doesn't address the core of your issue, but I was think that:

To reduce the load on wp, would it help to create a flat file
containing information about new uploads. This could be handled by a
filter or action during the post creation process.

Then your ajax calls will not invoke all the overhead associated with
a full database inquiry.

Claude Needham

Hi Adam 

Vagrant looks awesome!  This is definitely valuable and I think this will definitely be part of our process.  Will be reporting back along the way.

Thanks!

specific reason - giving the option for users to be able to add images with
dynamic sizes (a.k.a. setting image size in a shortcode and generating
thumbnail this way).

Now I would be pretty happy to migrate to the post-thumbnail integrated
feature. The problem is that I have unlimited size options and I can't add
infinite image sizes. Is there a way to pass the image size as a parameter
or extend legally this functionality with a guaranteed support in at least
the next few WP versions?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress in the Enterprise
Message-ID: <4EAEED28.1050903@gmail.com>

Reading through the mailing list:

 > Enterprise features/improvements are not being developed, as 
Enterprise is too small a use case.

This goes against what I've been told by core-devs, in that they were 
working towards better Enterprise support in WP.

Can someone please confirm that what Otto etc said is true, and 
WordPress is "not" interested in Enterprise users?

If so  ..... I'll start moving my clients to a more "grown-up" platform.

Rob


PS: [Perhaps the reason the enterprise use case is so small - is because 
of the lack of enterprise features?]

Or, alternately, get_the_post_thumbnail, if you're using a shortcode.

To successfully do this you need to take the following into account:

 - add a filter on site_url & network_site_url that changes the "wp-login.php" to point to the page you want.
    One caveat is this will not work for activating accounts on multi-site installations for the network site (ie the default main site.) because the wp-login.php url is hardcoded in the link on line 90 of wp-activate.php

 - In your custom login page be sure to manage the 'redirect_to' post parameter so that you redirect to the appropriate login url.  You should also add a filter on 'login_redirect' to handle any other redirects to the wp-login.php page.

 - I would also add an 'init' filter with priority 1 that checks is_admin() == true and is_user_logged_in() == false, at which point you should manually redirect to your custom login page and maintain your own redirect_to field (use a different key name.)

 - If you want to create accounts you'll need to hash your passwords in the database - I chose to sync the user accounts from our ldap server into the wp_users tables.  See here for hashing details: wp-includes/class-phpass.php

 - Finally you'll want to generate a valid session after you have accepted the credentials for login.  Because you are still using the wordpress login architecture, you don't have to do much magic here, just make sure the above is in place and redirect to the same form target as the real login page and use the same form variables.

After that you should be able to safely delete the wp-login.php page, or add an .htaccess rule that blocks direct navigation to it.

I did this process with a plugin that allowed user logins via an LDAP server instead of the wordpress core.  But it's not publicly available so I can't just send you the source code.  This is possible with a plugin, though with multi-site it does get a bit more challenging because of the hard-coding of the url.  There is still a huge hack to get around that but it's more in-depth than the above.

Hope that helps,
- Marcus Pope

Patrick,

Forgive my hacker-ish method of replying to your question.
I am mucho new to the wp core. But I am capable of running a few experiments.

auth_redirect() is the main function that handles the stuff you want to deal with.
It checks authentication then redirects to the login if necessary.

This function is found in wp-includes/pluggable.php

This is a pluggable function. I put together a fast plug in and found that I could easily redirect to bananas.php

What ramifications would this have?
How does this relate to the setup process?
What kind of admin page would be required to manage the name of the wp-login.php?
What goes on during (after) wp upgrade?

Proving that "something" is possible is easy. Finding an elegant and well thought out solution that anticipates the multitude of issues that could come from this is not so easy. Hats off to the guys and gals that code at that level.

If you want to hack a quirky solution together for your own website that might work okay. You'll have to tweak it after each wp upgrade.
(copying the new wp-login.php into bananas.php, and checking code in auth_redirect to make sure your plugin is up to date.)

If you want a plugin that can be added to the repository, I think you'd have quite a bit of work ahead of you.

However, I did notice that the function wp_login_url has a filter.
Maybe life will turn out to be as simple as writing a filter into the theme. But then again, you have the same admin issues to deal with when a wp upgrade comes along.

Regards,
Claude Needham

I know the process quite well, thanks. I have developed billion dollar
systems for multi-billion dollar companies. Please don't read more
into my statements than what is actually said. Just because I think
that relative URLs suck doesn't mean all the nonsense you're reading
into it is anything that I agree with. You're just taking it and
running with it, aren't you?

You can develop a system perfectly well with dev/test/production
methodologies without having to continually migrate content around and
fiddle with URLs. Basically, you don't build in any dependencies on
the URL being used, and you don't "stage" the actual content itself.

Don't confuse the content with the container. For example, if you're
making a change to a theme, then you're changing the container. The
content is the stuff in your database, in the posts table.

There are cases where URLs are being stored in serialized data, and
that's wrong. Those should be fixed on an individual basis. However,
this is a far cry from wanting relative URLs in your content itself.

It was cleary stated by a number of people, including yourself, that 
enterprise users are too small a use-case to consider making changes for.

Rather than beating around the bush here ... just want an honest answer 
to that statement made by several key people.


Is WordPress working on improvements for Enterprise users? Or not?


If it is ... what is it doing about it?
If it isn't ... well already stated my views.

Billion dollar systems? Very impressed.

However, I still disagree. The client doesn't want to see the container 
- they don't care in the slightest about the container.

They want to see the 100% finished article. With container, content, and 
*everything* in place, "before" going live.

When these changes are not just copy and simple theme changes - the 
preview function of WP just doesn't cut it.

Perhaps we should add a button in the write panel labeled 'Preview' just

Did a multi-billion dollar company really pay you a billion dollars for a wordpress site?  I'm sorry but I'm just confused by the wording of that sentence.  

I'm really not trying to be pedantic, I'm just curious to know what a billion dollar system is.

Thanks!

I know the process quite well, thanks. I have developed billion dollar systems for multi-billion dollar companies. Please don't read more into my statements than what is actually said. Just because I think that relative URLs suck doesn't mean all the nonsense you're reading into it is anything that I agree with. You're just taking it and running with it, aren't you?

You can develop a system perfectly well with dev/test/production methodologies without having to continually migrate content around and fiddle with URLs. Basically, you don't build in any dependencies on the URL being used, and you don't "stage" the actual content itself.

Don't confuse the content with the container. For example, if you're making a change to a theme, then you're changing the container. The content is the stuff in your database, in the posts table.

There are cases where URLs are being stored in serialized data, and that's wrong. Those should be fixed on an individual basis. However, this is a far cry from wanting relative URLs in your content itself.

I never said anything of the sort, nor even implied it, nor do I agree
with that statement in any way whatsoever. Bottom-line: You are simply
mistaken, sir.


> Is WordPress working on improvements for Enterprise users? Or not?

The WordPress core team is always working on various improvements for
all users. I know of no specific "enterprise" changes, but than I
don't know everything being worked on. I don't know of anybody
specifically against enterprise changes.

Your question needs clarification before a good answer can be formulated.
- What is an "enterprise" user? Define it.
- How is their use-case fundamentally different from anybody else's
who creates websites?

The notion that there are two kinds of users in the first place is one
that I kinda don't agree with. WordPress is geared towards people
making websites and publishing content, regardless of where, why, and
how they're doing it. When you start subdividing that set of users and
creating features targeted at some specific subset, then you're kinda
leaving other subsets out in the cold. I don't know if that's being
done or not, but I don't think it's particularly a good idea if it
were to be done.

If there's specific improvements or changes you want to discuss, then
I'm happy to talk about them. But when you start categorizing whole
sets of ideas together and then arguing about that, then I can't
really give specific details anymore. Some ideas are good, some are
bad, and both of those might be tagged with "enterprise" in your mind.
I have no way to know what you're thinking. So I'm not going to talk
about "enterprise features" because I don't have that label on any
particular feature or idea.

Perhaps we should read the rest of the email first.  ; - )

Last I heard, preview doesn't pull in template / file changes without 
putting them live first? Doesn't solve the problem mentioned in my email.

Replied to you with interesting details offlist, as this is irrelevant

I wish I got paid a billion dollars. I totally should have

Since I will assume you are versioning your theme files, hook into Template
Redirect (my first guess, others might think there is a better hook), check
is_preview(), and change your theme then.  Makes pulling in different
problems pretty easy.

@Robert,
I think you're generalizing your own enterprise use case to be indicative
of all use cases. I wouldn't normally spend time on this, but you're trying
to create doubt based on something very specific.

Instead of agitating for the core team to make these changes for you, why
don't you submit feature requests to Trac and organize the community to
make them? Or, write a plugin that solves this for an enterprise shop. Then
you'd have the right to sell it for $$$. Plus, since the core team doesn't
think this is a necessary change, you wouldn't need to worry about them
building it in.
--

Enterprise Worthy?:
In recent years WordPress has become a very enterprise-worthy platform
*and* a better platform for all users (not just the enterprise). The core
team steered that direction, and WordPress proliferated while many
"enterprise systems" have not. Even if you disagree with core now, your use
of WordPress shows some endorsement of past decisions.

We've probably all wanted something added to WordPress that took a while or
maybe still isn't built. So, WordPress may not solve all your problems
out-of-the-box, but it is enterprise-worthy. Plus we can customize it
at-will (unlike some enterprise platforms where you need to negotiate a
customization contract).

Besides, enterprise software will always need heavy customization. That's
part of doing business, every enterprise (& any-size business) has their
own ideas. If enterprise/business isn't always that way, then hope you work
for the company that eventually solves a business problem out-of-the box.
They'll put everyone else out of work.

-Mike

There is a palpable irony about people starting threads complaining
about threads they don't wish to read. Just skip it and move on.

@Erick - nice one, so paradoxically true.  I really did try to pull the debate off the list though I'm sorry it continues on.  I'll try to write a pandora's box plugin to avert the issue next time.

The "Mute" option in Gmail may very well have been introduced just for this list.

PROTIP for Gmail users:

Filter:
Matches: list:"wp-hackers.lists.automattic.com"
Do this: Skip Inbox, Apply label "wp-hackers"

I do one of these for every list I'm on. Then I can read them at will
instead of dealing with clutter. GMail makes mailing lists way easy.

Thankyou Otto :)

Also if you ever mute something and want to undo it, type in is:muted
and you will get a list of emails that are muted.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Advice on using Custom Post Types
Message-ID: <4EAF1FED.9010203@gmail.com>

I have 8 custom post types for a lottery website I am currently working, 
one custom post type for each game that is in the lottery, but I am now 
wondering if this is the best way to go about this, would I be better 
off do you think in creating 1 custom post type called draw results, and 
having all the games results in this one custom post type, and then have 
categories to select for which game the results apply to, or should I 
stick with the 8 custom post types, and list them under a game 
information page in my menu as this is how I currently have it setup.

Alternatively, using smart labels[1] in gmail automagically moves
almost all newsletter subscriptions -- such as google groups, mailman
emails, etc to the "Forums" label -- where you can choose to always
skip the inbox for such emails.

Smart Labels works even with filtering, BTW. If you subscribe to a lot
of lists, then you can have a separate label for each list, and the
Forums label will show all the lists in one place.

*Really* handy if you subscribe to lots of lists.

Either categories or a custom taxonomy will be more manageable, unless
there are substantive differences, such as post meta/meta boxes that differ
between the types.

If they have the same data and outlook to be populated and designed I'd go
with 1 custom post type and either categories or custom fields for the
small changes. Basically I use custom post types for entirely different
entities.

I agree with both Mario and Erick.  I might also suggest you add a 'Game Type' custom taxonomy or a '_game_type' custom field or  in which you store a key that indicates which gave type it is, and then capture different values into custom fields depending on which of game type of you for each.

I'm still wondering how relative URLs solve the underlying problem here. If you create the perception of totally segregated environments (dev, staging & production), but in reality, all three environments rely on the same WP tables, don't you create a content-developer's nightmare where publishing content to "staging" _actually_ publishes it to production as well?

Perhaps we should read the rest of the email first.  ; - )

Last I heard, preview doesn't pull in template / file changes without putting them live first? Doesn't solve the problem mentioned in my email.

Focus on what is most usable and don't worry about the JOINs.   So create a custom taxonomy called "Media."

You misunderstand. Creating another custom taxonomy does not add a JOIN, unless you are querying by both Category and by Media in which case you'll have more JOINs either way you do it, maybe even more if you use subcategories.

Worry about performance when performance becomes a real problem. Most of the time WordPress won't cause you performance issues unless you start trying to "out-think" WordPress' already built in optimizations.

Dagan, if you create three hosting environments (dev,staging,prod) and point them all at the same database, you'd have that problem with relative or absolute urls.

One intention with relative urls is to preclude the necessity of doing search/replace operations on the database content or using a tool to do it natively in wordpress environment.  So if you push content from dev to staging to production, you won't need to alter the database content at all.

One caveat of this process, is that you can't/shouldn't push the entire database to production if production already exists.  This is again a problem regardless of the url format.  You wouldn't want to overwrite/delete newly generated comments in production with a full copy of the staging database.  That is typically overcome by only exporting key tables that do not apply to user submitted content (in this case, typically comments.)

People handle this aspect differently, but the premise of having the dev/staging/production environments to begin with is that you never use the production wp-admin interface at all for content generation or alteration.  As a process you would generate it in dev, send it to qa, and only after confirmation of quality and customer sign-off, would you push it to production.  And each environment should have its own database to prevent cross-contamination.  QA departments would be mighty upset if their automation tests broke because you added or removed content in the midst of a test because it violates the sanctity of testing in isolation.

There are tactics to handle two-way syncs, so that during an outage period, you would sync the database down entirely from production to dev, then apply via a sql patch the records you wish to add to/remove from the database from the staging.  Send the merge through a final smokescreen round of QA and then push the result back to production.  After the entire process is complete you then open the site back up to end-user access.  Many websites go this route and the result is a much larger maintenance window/downtime.  But sometimes it's a requirement because the distinction between user submitted content and site generated content may not be so clear as it is with a vanilla wordpress install.

But the relative url theory doesn't just apply to removing the search-replace step, it also applies to accessing your host in a variety of ways - like using http://127.0.0.1/ or localhost on your dev workstation and using http://mycomputername/ on your iphone to test your development work from both a browser on your computer and your iphone over your wifi network.
