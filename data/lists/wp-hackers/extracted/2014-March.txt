I'm a student looking forward to take part in GSoC 2014. I would love to take part in the Form / Survey Plugin.

In preparation for my participation, I have written a plugin by name "Quote me"(https://github.com/quincykwende/quote-me).

I would be grateful if am pointed to the right direction.

Hi,

I'm a sophomore student of Mathematics and Computing from India interested
in participating for GSoC 2014 under Wordpress.

I've already thoroughly been through the wordpress ideas
page<http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2014> for
Gsoc 14. I'm really interested in working for the "Multisite Plugin-for
sharing database data between sites". I've already been through the links
provided in the description (thanks, were really helpful in giving me an
idea of what you really want). I've a basic layout in mind for the plugin.
I just wanted some guidance regarding some of the more specific
requirements.

I've designed two to three websites on wordpress, one for a national
level entrepreneurial
summit <http://udgam.in/?home=true> held in India. I've also got a fair
knowledge about the wordpress codebase. I've also provided a patch for bug
#23691 <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23691> (yet to be reviewed).
I would further like to work under Wordpress in this GSoC, Hoping for a
positive reply.

Thanks.

> Hey,

I am aware of that performance is not one of PhoneGap's strongest points
but the app we are developing here is simple enough to not be bottlenecks
by PhoneGap. If enough time is invested in optimising the app then it can
achieve almost native speed (Health Tap was featured as an Editor's choice
on the AppStore).
 Plus, using PhoneGap we can deploy on multiple platforms ensuring maximum
availability (I am thinking iOS , Android and if time permits Windows
Phone).
And all the apps having a single code base has its own benefits , imagine
bugs are fixed/features are added to iOS versions yet Android is lagging
behind because the particular developer who added the feature doesn't know
Java. What I am trying  to say here is that yes PhoneGap Apps are a bit
slow but if enough work is put into it that lag can be overcome (eg you can
remove atleast 300ms delay per touch by using ontouch instead of
onclick)  and the benefits provided by PhoneGap far outweigh the concerns.

Now onto some questions,
1. How do compile the iOS App as I don't have an developer account ? (You
need to have a key to
3. Do we need to create special versions for tablets or would stretching be
fine ?
2. How do I debug the iOS App as  I don't have an iPhone ? (Though I have
an iPad but its not jail broken and I would need an developer account to
get the app on the iPad.)

Thanks,
Yatin

Hi Quincy, we haven't started accepting applications yet, but keep an 
eye on the Codex page for specific instructions open up applications.

In the mean time, I skimmed through some of the code you referenced. I 
think you did a great job keeping it modular and organized (small 
functions that do 1 thing, files grouped into directories, etc); it's 
really nice to see that.

In most cases, you don't need to add custom database tables for your 
data, and it's considered a bad practice. Custom Post Types would be the 
appropriate way to implement a data store and CRUD interface for quotes. 
There should be plenty of articles about this on the web if you look around.

Check out the official coding standards on the Core Contributor 
Handbook. You're pretty close, but there are a few differences around 
white space. More is usually better :)


Instead of doing something like:

//sample data
	$value_1 = array( 'create_date' => time(), 'quote' => 'People eat meat 
and think they will become as strong as an ox, forgetting that the ox 
eats grass.', 'author' => 'Pino Caruso',);
	$value_2 = array( 'create_date' => time(), 'quote' => 'Nothing will 
benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on 
Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.', 'author' => 
'Albert Einstein' );
	$value_3 = array( 'create_date' => time(), 'quote' => 'If you don\'t 
want to be beaten, imprisoned, mutilated, killed or tortured then you 
shouldn\'t condone such behaviour towards anyone, be they human or 
not.', 'author' => 'Moby');
	$value_4 = array( 'create_date' => time(), 'quote' => 'My body will not 
be a tomb for other creatures.', 'author' => 'Leonardo Da Vinci') ;

     //insert sample data
	$wpdb->insert( $table_name,  $value_1);
	$wpdb->insert( $table_name,  $value_2);
	$wpdb->insert( $table_name,  $value_3);
	$wpdb->insert( $table_name,  $value_4);



...you could just do:


$current_time() = time();

$values = array(
     array( 'create_date') => $current_time, 'quote' => '...', 'author' 
=> '...' ),
     array( 'create_date') => $current_time, 'quote' => '...', 'author' ),
     array( 'create_date') => $current_time, 'quote' => '...', 'author' ),
);

foreach ( $values as $value ) {
     $wpdb->insert ( $table_name, $value );
}

Also, $value isn't very meaningful as a variables name; it's generic and 
could refer to almost anything. $quotes would be better because it's 
specific and helps make the code self-documenting. Write the code with 
the expectation that another developer will come along 6 months later 
and will need to be able to quickly read the code and understand what's 
going on.


Good luck with your application, and don't hesitate to reach out if you 
have any other questions :)

Hi Deven, sorry for the delayed response, but it sounds like you're 
heading in the right direction :)

Popups are almost always a bad idea because users hate them and most 
browsers block them, so instead you'd want to use a modal box. The Core 
API provides one that can be used by plugins.

It's also worth considering if it'd be better to just do everything 
inline, but a modal may be a better approach depending on how much data 
will need to be collected about each element, etc.

That's probably unnecessary, since the user can just add that to the 
page itself before they add the shortcode that renders the form.

WP already provides a standard AJAX handler (/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php), 
so it's best to use that instead of a custom one.



It's great to see that you're very enthusiastic about the project, but 
I'd caution against getting too deep into it at this stage. Once we 
accept an application, we'll get into more detail about the project 
specs and work through some things that still need to be decided, so any 
code you write today may not be applicable tomorrow.

I think that, right now, any potential applicant would be better served 
by spending their time learning to implement the fundamental features 
that are common in plugins, and also brushing up on best practices for 
WordPress development.

* actions and filters
* input validation / output sanitization, nonces, current_user_can()
* custom post types and custom taxonomies
* the settings api
* shortcodes
* how WP handles AJAX
* wp_cron
* multisite
* unit testing (phpunit and qunit)
* etc

Hi Quincy, if you're interested in working on Core, then the Forms 
project might not be the best one for you. It will focus on building a 
plugin, rather than contributing something to WordPress itself. Most of 
the other project are related directly to Core, though.

Don't worry too much about that at this phase; we'll get into details 
once an applicant is chosen. For now, just focus on learning more about 
WordPress development in general and working on some patches on the Core 
trac (if you want to work on a Core project), or the Meta trac (if you 
want to work on a Community project).

Hi Ian!
Thanks a lot for that Guidance! I needed just that.!

I was thinking about the Modal Thing only
,
but 
I got the nomenclature wrong. I had seen the
*ThickBox Library* for WordPress for that. Can this be used for the
Modals?

Anyways, I had been thinking too much about the Plugin itself and not the
overall WP coding standards and all the other things you have mentioned. I
will definitely go over through all this to get a much better idea how all
the things and features, that we have discussed, would be implemented in WP
and also refreshing the best practices and fundamental features in Plugin
Development.

Also, I will start working on the Application soon and will post the Link
here, once I am done. It would be great if you could suggest any
improvements/shortcomings in that.



Thanks again! :)
Will keep you posted on the Thread. 

Regards,
Deven

Message-ID: <CACL8fWbY+i3RGpJ_SKEMrzhtwPZ_s1e8ca0RxU9WvknYSO-nCw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm a 3rd year undergrad student of computer science from India. I'm
interested in the mobile in-app search for pages, posts and comments. I've
done some programming with Android and I've started trying to fix some bugs
and familiarize myself with the WordPress Android codebase.

I have a question about the description of the problem given on the codex.
Is the "user" specified the person who has logged in on the app so this
search is local to his posts and pages only? I also had an extension of
this idea whereby the search applies for the blogs that appear in the
Reader tab also, hence adding the search feature on the wordpress.com site
to the mobile app. I'd also like to suggest a more context based search
that reorders posts according to the type of post that the user is reading
currently. For example, if a user searches for travel, only posts that have
been tagged as "travel" show up presently. But if he is reading posts which
contain anecdotes about travel as opposed to posts about how to prepare to
travel to a particular place then the search results should change to show
him more blogs tagged with both "travel" and "humour".

Would this be applicable to the mobile search idea? Please let me know if
I'm heading in the right direction and what I could do to start off on this
or if I should submit this as a separate idea. I'd love to work with
WordPress.

Thanks,
Sanjana

Hi,

A) SupportPress as a Plugin
B) Forms Plugin

I am currently trying to understand these ideas and their
implementation. I have already submitted few patch to core. I am
wondering if developing a WordPress plugin is required as part of
application or it is optional?

Thanks,

P.S. I have attached link of the patch created by me. Out of which 2
are under review from 3 weeks. If possible please have a look at them.

My name is Gandharv Kapoor . I am a 3rd year student currently perusing CSE
at IIIT Delhi.
I have a descent prior experience in development on android platform. My
main idea of interest is "In-app Search" in wordpress android application,
reason being i have prior experience in coding my own custom search in some
my application.

Here's an example (Link to my application
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iiitd.ngo.findaway>) where i
implemented my custom search on ListAdapter which required searching
through restaurant names, discount and location through a common input.

Now coming back to wordpress application which as u said on gsoc page lack
the search capabilities , i have got the following queries :

   - Do you require a single search input for all these (post,comments etc)
   ?
   - Do you require an in-place searching , meaning as users enters letters
   by letters the screen keeps filtering matching terms or do you require a
   complete new matching result page which has got all the results?

Also i wont mind taking up an extra load on working on "View comments"
tasks, that can be a goal for 2nd evaluation (deliverable).
Would love to hear back from you.

Hi Varun, both of those projects would be creating plugins rather than 
working on Core itself, so if you're interested in becoming a Core 
contributor then you might want to consider some of the Core projects.

If you'd like to apply for a plugin project, then it's better to have 
experience developing plugins, but if you'd like to work on a Core 
project then creating Core patches is better.

Thickbox is still available, but it's no longer maintained upstream, so 
it's better to try and reuse the 3.5 Media modal if possible. See #10955.

I am aware that both of these projects are related to plugin
development. I cannot say about Forms plugin but I have tried
SupportPress and it seems to make heavy use of core libraries that are
also used by WordPress. So, I think, porting it to a plugin will
definitely give a good experience of core and will be helpful in
becoming a core contributor.

Hello,

I'm a UX design student (with a bachelor's degree in CS) from India. I'm
interested in the project "Refactor Distraction Free Writing mode and make
it the default for the Add New/Edit Post screens".

I'm looking to discuss about the same with either Eric Mann or Andrew Ozz.
What would be the best way to get in touch with either of them?

Thanks,

Description
================
CSRF in Google Analytics MU 2.3

Vulnerability
================
If an admin visits a page of the attacker?s choosing then the plugin?s 
settings can be altered. This could cause a mild disruption by breaking 
analytics until the problem is noticed, or if the attacker substitutes 
an analytics code they own they could gain access to the analytics data 
until the organisation notices the problem.
There should be a nonce check around line 71 of google-analytics-mu.php 
and a nonce around line 86.

Proof of concept
================
A simple form which changes the analytics code to ?abc?:
<form method="POST" 
action="http://localhost/wp-admin/network/settings.php?page=google-analytics-mu-network">
<input type="text" name="UAIDsuper" value="abc">

Over the weekend I received a patch for one of my plugins which changes how
I load a jQuery script from the Microsoft CDN.  The change removes the
"http:" from the URL leaving the remainder, including of the URL including
the "//".  The purpose of this change is to avoid mixcontent warnings when
serving the site over https.

I was a bit leery of making the change as submitted but did some reading
and found this article:

http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/

Is there a better way to support this within WordPress or is this solution
generally accepted as the right way to do it?

I've had a thought for the last couple of weeks, why not always use https?

Seems just better in every way imo.

I for one don't know any better way and enqueue all my stuffs with //. 
Why would one start messing with is_ssl() or whatnot and prefixing 
protocols based on results or whatnot, I don't know.

Actually, nevermind, I was wrong about that. The instructions on the 
Codex do say to work out the basic approach that you'd take. Some of the 
other discussions on the Forms project were getting too deep into the 
details, but yours was fine.

Your requirements are pretty good. A few things that are missing are: 
Question branching; pre-defined forms; And automating data entry from 
some form responses into WordCamp.org-specific custom post types. Check 
out the some of the other threads for details on those. Sharing forms on 
social media networks won't really be needed.

You're on the right track. The next thing I'd do would be to think about 
some of the implementation details. How will the data be stored? What 
parts of the WordPress API will you use? How will the admin place the 
form on their site? etc.

SupportPress was built on top of BackPress, which was an attempt to 
extract the reusable components into an external library, but it's not 
really maintained anymore.

There's a plugin called SupportFlow on GitHub that has a lot of the work 
done already, so the project may use that as a starting point.


In my experience, plugin development definitely helps you learn about 
Core, but it's not the same as working on Core itself. You learn more 
about the API than you do about the internals. So, it's definitely good, 
but it's not as good as working directly on Core.

It could be used as a stepping-stone into Core development, though. It's 
up to you.

Hello Ian,

Thanks for  reviewing my requirements. I would start thinking about
the implementation in detail. Also, I have looked at
http://polldaddy.com/ to get some inspirations too.

Also, I have checked out the official coding standards on the Core
Contributor Handbook and related articles as you recommended. I'm
presently modifying my plugin  "Quote me"

Thanks and Best Regards
Quincy

Yep yep. The project scope would be just the content synced to the app, 
not what was on the web.

the blogs that appear in the Reader tab

I suggest keeping the scope just to the user's own blog(s) for your 
project proposal.

Hey,

I disagree that the benefits outweighs the concerns but it?s not only for me to decide if PhoneGap is a viable solution for GSoC.
If the mobile team will manage most of it then it should be objective-c since they know that better. Also I?m still unsure if building it with PhoneGap is a two month project.

1. Not having a developer account would mean that you need to buy it. You do earn money with GSoC so I would see it as a investment.
2. We should have a special version for tables.
3. 3 would be solved with 1 but I guess having the ability to borrow a iPhone is probably necessary.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2014: JavaScript Unit Test Coverage
Message-ID: <5BD89025-7B74-4936-9651-00ECA9A0FADB@gmail.com>

Hei guys, 

I am interested in the ?JavaScript Unit Test Coverage? proposal added by Aaron Jorbin. I am quite unsure if he is active here on the mailing list since I never saw him posting here, anyway: My rough idea how to make this a success are the following three steps I would like to follow.

1. Identify: 
What are the most important parts of WordPress powered by JavaScript? Which WP JS parts were error prone in the past? ? So the general idea is to spend time and effort to find the right parts which should be covered by JS unit tests at first.

2. Cover:
Write the actual unit tests for the in 1. identified parts.
Eventually: Refactor established JS which ?is not testable at the moment?. (As mentioned by jorbin in the proposal)
I really like to have some hard numbers here, think of test coverage percentage.

3. Educate:
Build the foundation (docs, how to?s) so that more people can join the JS Unit Test force in the future.

I am thankful for feedback on this plan, especially concerning 1.: What would you say is the ultimate functionality to cover with JS unit tests?

Best Regards, 
Paul

Hi Ian!
I will look into the Media Modal thing but I think it may not even be
required. But at first, as you had rightly suggested, I am now
concentrating more on reading more and more about the general WP
development techniques, pre-reqs and getting the basics clear.!

Thanks.

Using protocol-relative URLs is a good idea. I've been changing lots
of things to do it that way.

Subject: [wp-hackers] [GSoC 2014] unique idea: Interactive Drag & Drop
	Content Editor
Message-ID: <CAPF3GTzMbBMUuhd6ryujWAfr3tyNrDMZxsENAj5ZMtL9+AH=xA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Mentors and WordPress community,

I am  a University student from Hungary and I am about to attend to GSoC. I
am motivated to create something new and usefull for the community.

This is my idea in a nutshell:
I think editing templates and basic layouts of a WordPress site can be a
hard task for an average user who doesn't know too much about webdesign. So
I would like to create an Interactive Drag & Drop Content Editor (something
like this: http://wordpress.org/plugins/plugnedit/), but of course a much
more professional one. According to my idea, the user would be able to
placing, re-scaling, dragging & dropping the blocks of content. Also it
would contain a property editor, which could handle css and other things as
well. I am also planing to design some pre-prepared elements (blocks of
content), which you can drag right into the site as a new block from an
editor panel. For the first time the default layout would be metro styled
and basically responsive and scalable. This project could be a WordPress
plugin or the part of WordPress it self. It depends on the requirements. I
am planing to use GSAP (http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/) for animations
and the newest technologies based on HTML5, JS, CSS, PHP and MySQL.

I think the Word Press community would appreciate a plugin like this.
Mentors, please let me know if you and the community are interested in my
project!

If you would like to know more about me please send me a private message or
reply to this one. Also, I can show you some of my previous works (some of
them is related to WordPress :D).

I hope you will be interested in my project and thanks for your reply in
advance!

Best regards,
Erik Engi

Out of curiosity though, would the WordPress community be interested in
seeing a context based search? It's a feature that I'd love to have. Would
the forums be a better place to find out if other people would also like to
have something like it?

Hi Sanjana,

I agree, its a neat idea. :) However, it sounded like it was focused on 
the reader, which is something that requires a WordPress.com account to 
get full use of.  Since, WordPress.org is the GSoC sponsor, we'd like to 
focus on features that benefit the entire WP community.

That's my opinion anyway. Maybe someone else would like to chime in?

I saw this thread and thought I?d pop a note on it?

Having just worked through the development of a ?Simple? app using phone gap, which is now submitted and undergoing apple review.  I have to say I would almost never do it again, and if I did I would not underestimate the numerous issues that are faced with the simplest of tasks.

For instance, something as simple as the status bar in IOS7 versus 6 initially led us to believe we would require a plugin?which didn?t work as advertised, that then led us to add pixels to push the screen down on IOS 7, which again didn?t work as well as advertised.  We ended up fussing about this tiny issue for a significant amount of time.

Phone gap makes it easier to deploy apps with no objective-c knowledge.  However it does guarantee you can make ?Good? apps without this knowledge.  Whomever is building the app will need to run Xcode on their Mac OS X system, and likely will be manipulating the delegate.m file to add in some code when it comes to any sort of add-ins like analytics additions, alerts, in-app web browser, etc.. They also need to ensure classes are registered, frameworks added and modify the plist file for various settings.  This all of course is depending on your needs, I doubt most apps will make it through without at least one phone gap plugin.

Also the documentation for many of those is horribly inaccurate at times to completely wrong in others.  Be warned that developers will need to do their research.  We worked on a project that was given 2 months and it took 3 instead after having to work through the ?phone gap -isms?.

The alternative to a local build is you can use the build service for phone gap, however?.If you are not paying for an account you are restricted to a 10 MB project.  If you are paying, you can get up to 50mb project.  The trick here is this size is the raw size of all your generated code, media assets and application code for all platforms?so if you have a few mb of assets for each, you?ll nearly start bumping the free limit.  So the alternative is to develop the app locally on your Mac OS X machine running Xcode (For IOS builds anyway).

Lastly?.just because it helps build multi platform.  Expect a lot of ?Why doesn?t that work on android?? or ?Why doesn?t that work on IOS??  It?s no where near perfect, you have to hand hold both and again with Android you will want someone troubleshooting it with Java experience using the Android SDK on Eclipse?it is incredibly slow, but it is the way it is done.

Our app is completed and going through apple review, it ties into our Wordpress site nicely, and it took a lot of work. I truly think we would have had a better app if we spent the month figuring out issues and learning object-c or java as needed.

Good luck!

I use protocol-relative links 99% of the time; it's that 1% that will bite
you.

The only time I don't is when I *know* that the subdomain changes on SSL
(like when some site use ssl.example.com or secure.example.com). One
real-world example was a script loading from a CNAME domain on CloudFront,
but the site admin didn't configure the domain to use SSL certificates.

I suggest checking to make sure the URL works with both http and https,
then going with the protocol-relative links.

Hi Erik, thanks for your interest in participating in GSoC.

I just wanted to point out that this idea is not significantly new,
and is typically referred to as a "front-end editor". There's actually
already an official effort to bring something similar into WordPress
core being done in a "feature plugin" here:
http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-front-end-editor/

If you're interested in contributing to it, you might want to catch up
on the meetings and discussions related to this:
http://make.wordpress.org/ui/tag/front-end-editor/

That said, this would be a conflict of interest with that in regards
to a completely new GSoC-sponsored project to also work on this in
another plugin, so it's chances of being accepted are not good.

If you were to scope your proposal more along the lines of
accomplishing a lot of this work on the existing feature plugin with
it's requirements in mind, you would have a much better chance of
being accepted.

Regards,
Bryan Petty

I'd just like to note that Keith has some very good points here, and
just to add to that...

Things like this make it prohibitive for other contributors to get
involved, or for the core team to continue maintenance on the
application. This doesn't work well for an open source project.

It's just not something I think the core team wants to commit to,
especially not with the existing native projects already in place,
which are already doing a great job overall.

I think they both watch this mailing list, but if you still don't hear
from them, I know they are frequently active on the IRC channels. I
would double check that they've seen your proposal there:

Message-ID: <CAJ7gacrgB8co=evBPZV5M_Y3NU=hDzAaz4+j_mPf-M+18OKoTg@mail.gmail.com>

We are refactoring our plugin (
http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar by the way it says
it hasn't been updated in 2 years, i released 1.10.5 two months ago but i
will open another thread for this ) to have a basic core and then sell
extensions.

What i plan to do is disable the extension if the licence is not renewed or
not entered. This basically means "do not add actions and filters for the
extension if the licence is not valid". So if the user after one year do
not renew the licence, i will make a call from our store to  our API and
set the extension as disabled.

Do you think this is too aggressive?Would you advice against this?

If you did that to me or a client, I'd never buy a plugin from you again, that's for certain.

So... yes, way too aggressive. Yes, I'd advise strongly against it.

Re-read the GPL and Plugin Guidelines and ask yourself if you'd want a plugin author to do that to your WP site... then provide enough value that users happily stay current on their support/upgrades license (those are fine to disable if  not paid for, but plugin code is not).

Doing that is absolutely, unequivocally not compatible with the GPL or with
free software philosophy in general.

Disabling the Plugin functionality for failure to pay a recurring
subscription is a use restriction that conflicts with GPL. GNU has also
explicitly stated that an API that is purely a use license API is not GPL
compatible.

So the plug-in can even get taken out of the repo.

As you've presented it, it's against the WPORG guidelines for plugins 
and reason for us to shut your plugin down for phoning home if it's done 
on the plugin in the ORG repo.

https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/ (see #5 through #7)

Now... I want to stress something. You can totally do this in a way that 
is both friendly to the WPORG repository AND the GPL.

You see, having a free core plugin in the WPORG repository and selling 
add-ons from your own site is PERFECTLY FINE. Easy Digital Downloads 
does it. However, the license check EDD uses is for getting updates for 
the add-ons, and it's not a part of the core plugin but the children. 
Also EDD does not disable the plugin when you don't pay, it disables 
your ability to get UPDATES. So you don't get new versions anymore.

So here, you're not going to shut down my site for not paying (something 
any reasonably annoyed code tweaker could turn off in about 10 minutes 
anyway, just FYI, by removing that check), you're paywalling my updates, 
so I can no longer get the new version which might save me headaches in 
a year when you update the core code base and now my extra cool add-on 
stops working.

You can do this. You should, however, keep in mind the fact that you're 
now making people pay for something that was free, and that rarely goes 
well. I would instead upgrade all the features of the free version, and 
then have all the NEW features be pay-for. It may take a while to build 
up that audience, but it's possible.

I think you guys misinterpreted what he was saying. He's talking about 
add-ons that extend the main plugin's functionality. The one available 
on the repository would be free and fully functioning, while add-ons 
would be available for a fee. He's asking if it would be okay to disable 
the add-on if no license is entered.

We had explored this option with WP SlimStat ( 
http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-slimstat/ ) , but we ended up using the 
license key mainly to make sure that those who purchased the add-on get 
notified when an update is available (pretty much what Envato does). 
Again, our main plugin is available for free and it's fully functioning. 
No features are disable, ever. Those who need more, purchase our premium 
add-ons, which are fully functional even without a license fee (after 
all, how hard would it be to tweak the code to circumvent such a silly 
limitation in an open source software?).

Best,
Dino.

Main Plugin, extensions, whatever. If you're disabling *functionality*,
then you're restricting *use*, which is GPL-incompatible.

You can disable access to updates and/or support (see Mika's previous
email) and remain GPL-compatible. But you cannot restrict *usage* if you
wish to remain GPL-compatible.

We're not misunderstanding ;-)

Cutting off support and upgrades is OK -- they have no right to that under the GPL.

Disabling code that was working/active because you did not renew a license is not compatible with the GPL. Even if it's a paid add-on, if it touches the WP API, it becomes GPL code.

The issue is removing access to code that is not yours to revoke anymore. Once you give them GPL code, you can't take it back... that's the core tenet of the GPL.

If you want to remove access if they are not paying you, you have to make a serviceware plugin and run the "service" on your server. e.g. Akismet, VaultPress, etc.

Those don't deactivate when you stop paying, they simply stop providing the service you were paying for (the GPL code remains intact and running). They will not break or cripple your site in the process. And, yes, deactivating a plugin without notifying the user will break some sites.

Hey,
What are your thoughts on using the following -

Steroids.js - Semi-Native, Transitions, Tabs and Nav Bars are native (top
bar & bottom bar) while everything else is rendered in a web view. Has only
partial native support on Android.

Titanium - As native as it gets without loosing cross-platform
capabilities. You basically call native functions using JS, has no web
views all the rendering is native and therefore can achieve 60 fps.

Thanks,
Yatin

You can't do that with GPL license. You can cut him off upgrades from your
official source only. Please read all open source licenses very careful,
there are other platforms you can migrate too if you have those wishes with
your software (take a look at Concrete5 that you can do exactly how you
intend to do). Choosing WordPress implies you to follow it's rules, if not,
choose the platform that offers you that possibility. It's that simple.

Obviously i was planning to do what Dino was saying, have a core plugin
which is always free and always work and sell some extensions from our
website and in case only disable those extensions.
But the feedback received suggest we only disable updates ( i think EDD
does that automatically so no problems here ), thanks for helping with this.

Hy Bryan,

Thanks for your reply and thanks for your advice too!

Actually, I tried the plugin you linked me, and I found it really usefull,
but that plugin is basically for editing posts and not for editing the
layout of a complete WorPress template. I would like to create something
which looks like Google Keep (https://keep.google.com/). So my plugin would
be a kind of blocky layout or template editor, with less limitations than
the mentioned  note keeping application. Do you know exactly what I mean?

If it is not a big problem that my idea is more about to editing the
template and the whole WordPress pages them self, than I think it is a good
idea to extend the official plugin to a template editor as well. I likely
contribute with other WordPress developers, if it is necessary.

What do you think about this issue? Also, if you like my idea, than I will
start to design some conceptual images about it which I will be include in
my proposal as well. Maybe, than you will see what my exact idea is.

Thanks for you being helpful and thanks for your reply in advance!

Best regards,
Erik Engi

A built-in (or at least free) version of http://headwaythemes.com/ (and similar products on the market)? That would be awesome.

Hi Dobri,

Yes, this is definitely what I mean, you got my idea, but I am planing to
design it more easy to usable and I would like to create a simple and clear
UI for it. Also, it would be open source (of course), if GSoC will accept
my proposal, and it could be the part of the WordPress core if the
community and the mentors wish it.

Mentors, if someone of you is interested in my project and you think it
would be a good project for GSoC, than please contact with me. It is
important for me, because than we can start to specify the details of the
project and I am able to start working on my proposal.

Thank you Dobri helping me out and thanks for your responses in advance!

Regards,
Erik
 Engi

This was proposed recently, have a look at
http://make.wordpress.org/ui/tag/ceux/ . There are also several commercial
plugins/themes/options panels that offer this (some of them are stand-alone
bundles).

CEUX seems to be a modular content editor, while Erik is proposing more of
a site-builder solution(where you can change and drag-drop each detail of
the page and not just the content).

On a side note it's sad that CEUX got put on hold - it seems to have pretty
good potential in it.

CEUX has actually been picked up recently by Diego de Oliveira, who is
working to move forward with the original vision that was discussed last
fall. It's not as vivacious as WP-API or some of the other feature plugin
options, but don't count it out--if you're interested, we'd welcome you to
come watch the repo and chime in with the discussion!

You mention wishing to use GSAP (http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/),
however the license (http://www.greensock.com/terms_of_use.html) doesn't
appear to be gpl2+ compliant, specifically the LIMITATION OF LICENSE AND
RESTRICTIONS section.

Hi all,

You are right Nikola. My idea is to make site-building with WordPress even
more easier. Also, if this project will be realized, than I think even
those who are not site builders will be able to create and design a unique
customized template or layout for WordPress. So I am sure it can be a new
milestone in WordPress development.
Thank you for explaining my idea from an other view!

Dear Aaron, I didn't used GSAP before. I used my own JavaScript animation()
function based on CSS animations instead, but some moth ago I read this
article: http://css-tricks.com/myth-busting-css-animations-vs-javascript/It
was really impressing for me, so I decided: if I start a new project I
will use GASAP for animations.
WordPress is free of charge, so I thought it is okay to use GSAP for
open-source projects, but now I know I can't use it for a WordPress plugin,
because the issue you mentioned. So if you support my idea, than I should
use something else maybe stay at the proven CSS animations.
Thank you for mentioning this licence compatibility problem!

Thank you all for your answers!

 Regards,
Erik Engi

There are dozens of drag and drop WordPress layout builders / visual
composers in the wild, not to mention that most theme shops already have
this type of functionality for better or worse. Layout builders are very
theme centric, so I don't see how it would ever belong in core, something
like CEUX though would benefit a larger audience since it works with the
new TinyMCE "block" features. They are both similar in some regards but
have different implications. My suggestion would be to dive into some of
the visual composers out there and so what's available, there are literally
to many of them to mention.

Yes, I believe I understand generally what you mean now.

> What do you think about this issue?

Well, the most helpful details to understand right now, even before
getting into mocking out user interface, is to detail out what you
think the project requirements for such a project would be, and also
detail out how you think you might be able to fit those requirements
into a schedule that aligns with GSoC deadlines. You will be required
to do this before submitting your proposal anyway, so if you help us
understand what the scope of your project includes here, we can
actually help you adjust those details now before you even submit your
proposal.

How do you think such a plugin could be maintained after GSoC is over?
What do you imagine the future of this plugin is?

Message-ID: <9dbf91daf259316767a106211e0b27ec@tv-productions.org>

Hi wp-hackers,

I have a plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-photo-album/) with a 
custom post type and as update I've added successfully support for 
revisions. But when I restore an autosave, the metadata (that is saved 
with the revisions) is empty. After digging into the code, I found out 
that autosave only checks the title and the content (which in my plugin 
doesn't exists on the edit page) for differences and saves only them.

So I was wondering if there is (or will be in the near future) a 
autosave API that allows to save also "custom data". And, if that is not 
the case, does anyone know a workaround to save my metadata with 
autosave?

Best regards,

Ties

Does autosave not trigger the save_post and/or edit_post actions?  You
could probably hook on to those.

Andrew,

I believe it does so, but it doesn't submit the whole post form.

This is the post data that a typical autosave request has (after the 
title has changed)
==================================
action          autosave
autosave        true
autosavenonce   ebb79c8859
catslist
comment_status  open
content
excerpt
ping_status     open
post_author     1
post_id	        2996
post_name	a
post_title      Ab
post_type       easy-photo-album
==================================
I hope my problem is a bit more clear now.

Ties

Message-ID: <CAGSVupoOGQssdGUuKd1E7jkzcV5NZCPjXJBBjGjqo2dC-wbufQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey !
I am Aman from India, pursing B.Tech in Computer Science.
I'm interested in contributing to Wordpress during these summers through
GSOC.
I've been using Wordpress since 2010[www.kodevelop.com] and recently
started using the WP_android app too and want to help in further
developments.

> I've made several wordpress sites, a Wp theme and tweaked WP codebase in
the recent past.
> I've prior experience in developing and modifying android apps and code.
Also I was an Android-developer + Intern in a startup during my 6 month
training and internship period. I've uploaded 2 apps on the play store[1]
also and contributed in many others as well[2 & 3].
[1] https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Mr.Singh
[2] https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spartanstartups
[3] https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arcadian.bbsbec
[4] https://github.com/aman-devy/snippets

Currently I'm interested in the following two ideas:
1.  View Comments by Post in WordPress for iOS and Android
2.  Mobile In-app Search for Posts, Pages, Comments

I'm able to build the source code in Android studio, but Eclipse IDE is
creating some issues. Here's the error:
[2014-03-05 11:14:30 - WordPress-Android] /WordPress-Android/gen already
exists but is not a source folder. Convert to a source folder or rename it.


We can implement the first idea in long click menu in the posts activity
and add a new entry by name 'view comments'. From there take the user to
comments page and highlight/sort the comments related to that post.

Also I would like to implement a new feature(Sorting) in posts menu. The
user can sort posts on the basis of published posts, drafts and scheduled
posts or by date/tags. It can be implemented in the action bar menu by
adding a new drop down menu group with a filter like icon. The
sorting/filtering algorithm can then be used in the list adapter.

Any kind of advice or suggestions on how to proceed with the codebase would
be appreciated.


regards
Aman

Currently WP doesn't store revisions of post meta data, but there are plans
to do this. See this ticket: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20564

John Blackbourn has written a small tutorial to make it work with a plugin,
too: https://johnblackbourn.com/post-meta-revisions-wordpress

Hy Bryan,

Thank you for helping me adjusting the details!
I started to create a Google Document in which I added the requirements.
Here it is:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cp8d5eDtjsipF3rzqx0dU-dQ-eidfa_OU4n1qQ2eNow/edit?usp=sharing
Feel free to add some note if you wish. After the requirements are fixed I
will create a detailed schedule plan for the project. Please let me know if
I need to add something or if I need to go into details. This document
contains now just the basics.

I think, after GSoC is over other WordPress community members could
contribute to this project and maintain the code and add new functions as
well.
As I mentioned it before, I think this plugin can help and make even more
easier to create templates for site-builders. I believe with such a plugin
even everyday WordPress users can customize their own page layout. So I
think the users and the community will be happy to use this plugin, because
it gives more possibility to edit the page layout structure and it extends
the usability of WordPress. Also, I think the future of this plugin is that
it will be useful for many WordPress users.

Regards,
Erik Engi

Thanks Pascal! I am going to dig into ticket 20564.
That small tutorial is very nice, I used it to make my revisions work. 
The problem is really the autosave. When you restore an autosave now, 
all the meta data is lost.

Hi Aman,

A good place to ask questions about the codebase in the 
#wordpress-mobile IRC channel on freenode where the app devs hang out.  
You should also look through the Android section of the mobile handbook 
at http://make.wordpress.org/mobile/handbook/

You're welcome to propose multiple GSoC projects but each student can 
only work on one project, so that's something to keep in mind.

Cheers,
Eric

Message-ID: <CABQWr5yc39V9ji-ngOmN9=YENVw5PQeQw2KaCFh70S6+mjy0bQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm wondering if anyone can help me from making a careless .htaccess
mistake.

My WordPress Address (URL) is:  http://mydomain.com/wordpress

My Site Address (URL) is:  http://mydomian.com

Going to http://mydomain.com/wordpress/some-permalink successfully
redirects to http://mydomain.com/some-permalink.  But going simply to
http://mydomain.com/wordpress gives a 404.

What is the wisest/safest way to get rid of this 404?

This is the rewrite rule from the .htaccess in the
http://mydomain.com/wordpress/ subdir:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /wordpress/
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /wordpress/index.php [L]
</IfModule>

Thanks.

	between sites
Message-ID: <CALh8u3=He_JXX5MboduubL5ePgKJc3-B3b9Yxmmi8SawMaBzwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
As stated on the gsoc page one of the use cases can be of a shopping cart
across a network.

We can start by dedicating a sql table in the database for such items which
have to be shared across the cart (Every item has a unique id). Now, for
each site we could probably give the admin of that site the choice to
select the products which he wants to display on his site (and add these
values along with their unique ids in the table dedicated for that
particular site). We can then use inner sql joins to create a connection
between this new table and the table of the main admin. In this way whole
stocks can be shared across an e-commerce website, along with quantities
and other datas associated with them.

I just wanted to know whether this approach solves the problem at hand. I
might be wrong in the interpretation of the problem, please correct me. Any
suggestions changes etc. are most welcome :)

I wanted to make a correction on the codex (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/current_user_can

which is on this page) ,

where it says

if ( current_user_can('edit_post', 123) ) {
 echo 'The current user can edit post 123';
}

so that after the correction it would say 'edit_posts' ( instead of
'edit_post' )


With that in mind, I clicked on link the login to codex link which lands on
this URL

http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Function_Reference/current_user_can

The page is titled as "Log in / create account"

But how do you create an account there?
Am I missing something??

Also, I could not see any password reminder link in the username/password
box area.

You can register from the Support section -
https://wordpress.org/support/register.php

By the way why do you want to change "edit_post" to "edit_posts"? As far as
I'm aware the current one is correct(since it's about editing a specific
post - hence the 123 passed as second parameter).

You are right about the correction...
Since it is about a specific post, it is supposed to be 'edit-post'  (and
stay as is) as opposed to the general editing capability which ties to
'edit_posts'

Thank you for your register link, though I don't need it anymore cause I
don't need to correct the codex. :)

Use your normal WordPress.org login. Same one you use for the support
forums or anywhere else on WordPress.org.

Hi Paul,

In general, I like your plan.  A couple of notes on it:

Step one should be accomplished as a part of the pre-dev section.  On
http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc201<http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014>
*4* this is identified as "Students get to know mentors, read
documentation, get up to speed to begin working on their projects."  This
way you can start coding on day one.

I don't think aiming for a certain test coverage percentage is the right
route to go.  When you do that, all you end up with is a lot of tests and
not really useful tests.  I think it would be much more useful to identify
actual bugs and then adding tests for those (part of what you mentioned
doing as prep work).

Coming up with some more complete documentation seems like a good idea.
http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/09/13/javascript-unit-tests-for-core/is
the only real source right now.  The main goal of GSOC though is
producing code, not producing documentation.  This portion should really
take place only at the end

Functionality that I think could really use some tests are things that are
more API/library than specific interaction focused.  heartbeat is something
that springs to mind.

Postscript: Sorry, I forgot to reply to the scheduling issue. I think this
project aligns with GSoC deadlines and I am able to develop this plugin on

project.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Multisite - Plugin for sharing database data between
	sites
Message-ID: <CALh8u3=BCA-7fnyQXZywS-y1B3iBT0NV0qCG3TQnkVxnxY1kTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is in regards with the Multisite-Plugin for sharing data between sites
given on the gsoc 2014 ideas page. I have earlier sent my approach towards
this idea but haven't received any response. :(

Is this idea still active? have any mentors been decided for this idea?(On
the page its written TBD), if yes how may I contact them?

Thanks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,
As stated on the gsoc page one of the use cases can be of a shopping cart
across a network.

We can start by dedicating a sql table in the database for such items which
have to be shared across the cart (Every item has a unique id). Now, for
each site we could probably give the admin of that site the choice to
select the products which he wants to display on his site (and add these
values along with their unique ids in the table dedicated for that
particular site). We can then use inner sql joins to create a connection
between this new table and the table of the main admin. In this way whole
stocks can be shared across an e-commerce website, along with quantities
and other datas associated with them.

I just wanted to know whether this approach solves the problem at hand. I
might be wrong in the interpretation of the problem, please correct me. Any
suggestions changes etc. are most welcome :)

Hi,

I'm a sophomore student of Mathematics and Computing from India interested
in participating for GSoC 2014 under Wordpress.

I've already thoroughly been through the wordpress ideas
page<http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2014> for
Gsoc 14. I'm really interested in working for the "Multisite Plugin-for
sharing database data between sites". I've already been through the links
provided in the description (thanks, were really helpful in giving me an
idea of what you really want). I've a basic layout in mind for the plugin.
I just wanted some guidance regarding some of the more specific
requirements.

I've designed two to three websites on wordpress, one for a national
level entrepreneurial
summit <http://udgam.in/?home=true> held in India. I've also got a fair
knowledge about the wordpress codebase. I've also provided a patch for bug
#23691 <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23691> (yet to be reviewed).
I would further like to work under Wordpress in this GSoC, Hoping for a
positive reply.

Thanks.

eCommerce isn't something included with WordPress core, there are plugins
that have different implementation.

Your idea would suite for a woocommerce addon for example that would have
sharable data in multi sites.

WordPress multisites already has the option to use data from different
sites in the network as you need.

Hi,
thanks for the reply. :)

The post on the gsoc page is as follows
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently there is no way to easily share data across sites on a multisite
network, even if it's a closed, trusted, network. Existing options, such as
using switch_to_blog(), inline frames, or redirects, don't work well. This
could start as a "features-as-plugins" project and maybe eventually make
its way into core.

   - Example Use Case: Sharing data/inventory/shopping cart across sites
   - This idea inspired, in part, by @ipstenu's blog post:
   http://halfelf.org/2013/ecommerce-dream/
   - See also @nacin's
   http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/06/potential-roadmap-for-multisite/
for
   a discussion that includes differentiating closed and open networks.

Possible Mentors: TBD (Possibly Jeremy Felt? Nacin?)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this approach, is my approach feasible.
Maybe I'm wrong in the interpretation of the problem. If yes please guide
me in understanding the problem.
Will appreciate your help. Hoping for a reply :)

Thanks.

 If I hooked into it for a specific post type, would it trigger for

	Per-Forum moderation
Message-ID: <CAMab33xvQ8F8aYLHvzjGUQvTS5MsR_Aj3aSMEAh5hsYhqMvyow@mail.gmail.com>

Hello! I'm a first time GSoC participant and am just starting looking into
prospective ideas for organisations I'm interested in. Out of those I like
WP's bbPress Per-Forum moderation proposal as forums are something I've
played with for a long time, and since I don't have any direct experience
with WP, it'd be a good entry point into development with WP.

I thought I'd say Hi and start up on how I should proceed from now, I'm an
experienced PHP coder (http://github.com/Dragooon is my GH repository) but
I don't have any meaningful experience in developing core WP or plugins for
WP. How should I proceed as the applications are starting fairly soon? Any
advice is appreciated, I understand that some code samples might help me
but I'm not sure what I should code related to this proposal that isn't the
actual proposal itself.

Thanks

Message-ID: <CAG+zT3p6KYoE38Oc2PQuJ2krHBsBZWArueZg2CAy8LJPhjSV5w@mail.gmail.com>

Noticing some odd behavior when I upload an image with meta information.
One of the fields has "? 2013".

When it is serialized to the database I see:

s:7:"? 2013";

When I do this in vanilla php:

$a = chr(169) . " 2013";
echo serialize($a);

I get

s:6:"? 2013";

which seems like the correct serialization. Has anyone run into this before?

Actually just the first case is correct, where length is set to 7 bytes, 
because copyright symbol (?) takes up two bytes.
While it's encoded in HTML as "&#169;" it's not necessarily copyright 
symbol at 169th position in ASCII table (what `chr` returns).

So second encoding is incorrect and if you try to paste it into some PHP 
console you may randomly get an error "PHP Notice: unserialize(): Error 
at offset 11 of 14 bytes" in some cases, while first example should 
unserialize without any errors.

You're comparing different character sets.

In ASCII, the copyright symbol is the character with code 0xA9.

In UTF-8, the copyright symbol is the character with code 0xC2 0xA9.

That extra byte is relevant to the serialization that you're seeing.

Hi all,
I am really interested in Wordpress and I need to be a part of the
Wordpress family. I looked at the project ideas of Gsoc 2014 which you have
given and I am interested in the "Group Theme/Plugin Combo" project. I
tried to download the source code and configure it in my computer to get a
better idea about the wordpress. But I couldn't do it properly. Do I need
to use any specific IDE to develop in this project? How can I properly
download this project and configure it for development? I really appreciate
if you can give instructions about that.

Thank You

There isn't a best "recipe" for development with WordPress.

Some people prefer classic ways like code editors, text/console: vim, nano;
gui: sublime-text, brackets, notepad++, gedit, komodo edit etc.

Others use full IDEs like Eclipse, Aptana, Zend Studio, Netbeans, PHPStorm
etc.

If you prefer an IDE, make a new project out of the base directory of your
local WordPress installation and follow the normal way of building new
plugins or themes. If you're into working on the core, then dig more from
here: https://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress.

Something I prefer:

I use Puphpet (https://puphpet.com/) to generate some startup scripts and
configs for virtual machines used for php projects (one for mysql/mariadb
and several others for different versions of php, testing with nginx and
apache etc.) - that offered me an environment easier to maintain and 100%
identical between my desktop and my laptop so I can work anywhere.

I have several WordPress installations that are linked (not possible under
Windows, you need to make them in the shared folder of a machine and can't
link between them, Windows doesn't supports soft linking) to the shared
folders of this machines and serve for a few projects. This way I'm working
in Netbeans (my preferred IDE) with only a few projects opened, but I'm
able to test on multiple configurations much faster.

Also the virtual machines are configured from start to support Xdebug and
debugging it's so simple this way.

For version control I use git, that also has subversion capability and I
don't have to learn two different tools for the same scope. This helps me a
lot and also helps me collaborate very easy with other people on some of
the projects.

So, best is you should "build" your preferred development environment based
on how you're working with Web/PHP projects, as it's similar to other CMS's
or PHP frameworks (I also use it for Symfony and Drupal identical).

Basically, the set_current_screen function gets an instance of the
WP_Screen object and calls it to set the $current_screen global. It should
not be something you have to call yourself, it's called automatically for
all admin pages.

WP_Screen is explained a bit here:

As hint to understand the data inside the array can you use the plugin

This plugin list all data of current screen in a tab.

Hi Ian!
I have been reading more about the general WP Development recently. I must
say, it is helping me a lot. I am realizing the things that I mostly would
forget or take for granted without knowing why am I doing it. I think my
coding style would see a nice shift from what I had coded in the Simple
Plugins that I wrote to what I would develop after reading this.

Also, I have trying to think more about the Problems that may arise in
implementing the Plugin. The most prominent one that I could think of was
of Preventing the Spam (I guess, always a major problem in Forms). The
Sanitizing Functions like esc_ functions,data validation functions,
sanitize functions etc that I read about will be useful here. Any more
Ideas/suggestions would be more than welcome here.

I am working on my project application now.
Will keep you informed. :)

Regards,
Deven

Hello,

Its been long time I sent my introduction got stuck with my
mid sem exams and was not much activity on the list.

I have few queries regarding this project:

1.I have seen the reference mentioned on the page and I could see that
template development has been started.
   So will this project be like taking up the work done so far and taking
it to a publishable level or I can start from scratch
   using those tickets and work which has been done on the given github
template as reference for this project.

2.Does buddypress theme will required to be responsive?

3.Is is a good Idea to use bootstrap in case we will be building a
responsive template?

4.If this needs to be extension of current development is their any small
task in current template which can be given to me so that I can get a bit
of idea what kind of knowledge or areas I have to brush up or improve
before engading into template developement will be a great help.

5.I have fair knowldege of normal wordpress theme developement.It will be a
good help if you can tell me how this template project is different from
normal wordpress/buddypress theme.Please donot take this as I am asking to
be spoon feed but any pointers are always helpful from experience members.

I hope I am not too late and will get a chance to work on this project this
gsoc :)

Any other comments and suggestions are welcomed.

Regards
Bhuvnesh Joshi

Thanks Shitiz, that looks pretty good :)

Here are a few things to refine:

* Advanced field types and stats are nice, but not necessary for the 
first version. They can be added if there's time after the core 
components are finished.

* Question branching is a must-have feature. (e.g., the user is asked an 
additional question depending on how the answered a previous question). 
That's probably similar to the conditional field logic you mentioned.

* Pre-defined forms is a must-have feature (e.g., a base "call for 
speakers" form that can be customized and added on to by each admin)

* Another must-have feature will be automating some actions for certain 
forms. For example, when a potential speaker submits the Call for 
Speakers form, the should automatically have a Speaker post created and 
set as a draft. That way the WordCamp organizers won't have to 
copy/paste the data from their submission into a Speaker post.

Since the plugin should be generic enough to live in the WordPress.org 
plugin repository, features like this that are specific to WordCamp.org 
would probably be implemented as a second plugin, and the base plugin 
would simply provide the necessary custom hooks to allow the second 
plugin to integrate with it.

* See the original idea posting and past wp-hackers threads for more 
details on other must-have features

* Order/pricing isn't relevant to WordCamps. They're not-for-profit 
events and the only thing attendees purchase is a ticket, which is 
handled by the CampTix plugin.

* Role-based fields and form limitations probably wouldn't be necessary 
for the first version.

* Form fields should be added through a UI rather than shortcodes. We'd 
only want a shortcode for the form itself. See previous threads on 
wp-hackers for a discussion about that.

* Each form will be a post, and the fields and other data will be stored 
as postmeta. Same for responses.

Validating and sanitizing data isn't specific to a forms plugin or spam 
-- it's necessary for any plugin dealing with any data that isn't 
hardcoded -- but it's definitely good to learn about and will be a 
requirement for the plugin.

For spam specifically, there are lots of traditional options like 
CAPTCHAs and hidden form fields to trap bots, but another possibility is 
using the Akismet API -- http://akismet.com/

It'd be a good idea to take a look at the Jetpack forms module and see 
what option(s) they use.

Hi Ian !

Okay. I will look into JetPack Forms as well as Akismet to learn more about
it.


Meanwhile, I have prepared a rough application draft for the Project
Description on my blog.
Here is the Link<http://devenbansod.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/project-description/>to
it !  : GSoC
2014 Proposal<http://devenbansod.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/project-description/>

It would be great if you could just review it and suggest any
changes/shortcomings in my Application.

Thanks.

Regards,
Deven

Yes, that was mostly the intention of conditional field logic, I'll move it
up to must-haves.

I agree, this can be done fairly easily as a sub-plugin that auto-posts any
form submissions. I had something similar in mind but wasn't sure it'll be
a requirement

One feature that I probably missed was auto-filling forms from previously
stored data. From what I understand, the requirement is to fill, say a
"Call for Speakers" form with the data that the user has already filled in
a previous form?

Ah okay, I can save this for a future side-project if this takes off.

* Form fields should be added through a UI rather than shortcodes. We'd

I see, that'll probably allow for more robust processing of forms.
Basically, store the form as a post but store the fields, field's meta etc.
as postmeta, same for responses. Actually this solves a lot of processing
problems I had when thinking how to statistical queries, if required down
the road. Responses can be stored as <post_id>, form_<field_name>_response
which I can then query to gather totals etc. Thanks!

Right. When a user creates a new form, it would start out blank, but 
there would be a dropdown list of pre-defined forms. The pre-defined 
forms will probably be created via a filter callback in the sub-plugin.

If the use chooses a form from that list, then the form that they're 
creating will be based on the pre-defined form they chose, and will 
inherit the fields, etc. They can still customize the new form to add 
extra questions, etc.

The purpose of this is to make it easy to quickly create common forms, 
and also to have some standardization to them across WordCamps, while 
still allowing enough flexibility to let organizers make it fit their 
individual needs.

It's the other way around. When a potential speaker fills out the Call 
for Speakers form, the results of that would be stored in a response 
post like any other form, but there would be some additional logic in 
the sub-plugin that would also create a drafted Speaker post.

On WordCamp.org we have custom post types for Speakers, Sponsors, 
Organizers and Sessions. e.g.,

http://2014.atlanta.wordcamp.org/speakers/
http://2014.atlanta.wordcamp.org/sponsors/
http://2014.atlanta.wordcamp.org/sessions/
http://2014.atlanta.wordcamp.org/organizers/

Currently when a potential speaker submits a Call for Speakers form, the 
results are e-mailed to the organizers, and they have to copy/paste the 
data into a the Speaker post. We just want to automate that process for 
them. The speakers would all have a 'draft' status to start with, and 
then the organizers can publish the speakers that they've chosen to accept.

The code for the custom post types is in the meta.svn.wordpress.org 
repository if you want to take a look or install it on your local 
environment.

Thanks Deven, this looks good :)

Here's a few things to take into consideration:

* Because the plugin will use custom post types, it's not necessary to 
bulid a custom CSV exported. WordPress' export tool will already 
recognize the data and is able to export it just like it would with 
standard posts and pages.

In general, it's always best if you can leverage Core's API to do 
something in a standard way, rather than reinventing the wheel.


* JavaScript can be used for data-validation on the client-side, to give 
the user immediate feedback when they enter something invalid, but it's 
important to remember that it also needs to be validated on the 
server-side, since nothing on the client side can be trusted from a 
security standpoint.

Validating on the client side is optional and improves UX, but 
validating on the server side is mandatory to prevent things like SQL 
injection.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Data_Validation
http://wordpress.tv/2011/01/29/mark-jaquith-theme-plugin-security/


* It's important to use gender-neutral language. The WordPress community 
has a very high percentage of women involved at all levels, and using 
only masculine pronouns can be unintentionally dismissive and exclusive.

I'm sure that you didn't mean anything like that; it's a hard habit to 
get out of and something I catch myself doing too. But it's important 
that we encourage each other to be more inclusive and keep each other 
accountable.

More background info and alternatives are available at 
http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Nonsexist_language


Other than that, your proposal looks good and is on the right track. If 
you haven't already, just make sure you're following the other 
discussions about the Forms project on wp-hackers and #wordpress-gsoc so 
that you can learn from them as well.



I also noticed you've got a few plugins in the wordpress.org repository, 
which is great! That'll give you valuable experience and help you get 
started quicker if your proposal is accepted. I took a quick look at 
them and have a few suggestions:

* Instead of echo'ing HTML via PHP, you can close the PHP tag and output 
the HTML raw, with PHP tags inserted as needed. That makes it much 
easier to read.

For example: 
https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/google-authenticator-per-user-prompt/trunk/views/token-prompt.php


* Rather than issuing SQL queries directly, you can almost always 
achieve the same results with the WordPress API. For example, 
get_posts() instead of SELECT * FROM $wpdb->posts.

That is generally easier, more performant, more secure and more 
future-proof.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference can be helpful to get an 
learn what's available to you.


* It's important to use meaningful variable names. Names like $a and $r 
require anyone reading the code to go through it line by line to figure 
out what it's doing, rather than it being obvious.


* It's best to follow the WordPress coding standards at 
http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/ so that your 
code is consistent with the rest of the community.


Thanks for the work you've put into your proposal and plugins, and good 
luck with the process. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

Oh. Yes ! That would be make it really much simpler. And yes, doing the
same thing, for which a better solution is already available won't make
sense. ! This is how I am understanding the power of Open Source!

Yes. I have been thinking on the same lines that JS will provide the UX
improving things such as Prompts to check a blank submission and all. And
yes I fully understand that Server side Validation will be most important
with preventing SQL injections and we can then provide the options for
Unique Applicants and many such things to build on it. !

Thanks for this one ! The newbies in the Developer culture (like me) tend
to forget these small but very important details. It was nice of you to
remind us about it. I will surely take care of it in future.

Yes, I have been regularly following the other Discussions on the Forms
Project on the wp-hackers and I must say others doubts, ideas or your and
others suggestions/replies to them has helped me learn alot and answers
half of my questions there only. I will now try to be present on
#wordpress-gsoc chats too.

I had read the Coding Standards at the start but there I had neglected
it. But now, recently I have been working on beautifying my code of the 2
plugins, changing the Variable Names to some logical ones and would be
issuing a new commit to the plugins soon. I now understand that in any
piece of code, its readability impacts how other developers perceive your
code.

I would make all these suggested changes and then submit my proposal.



Anyways, thanks alot Ian ! For helping us out all these days and being
patient enough to answer all our queries/doubts so nicely.

It has a been great Experience to interact with all on the list. Hoping to
continue and grow our interaction in coming days!

Thanks.!

Cheers,
Deven

Message-ID: <CADNDr93FwODr39N=htTM9Bb4MLUg=V6JBPsMDLiQxBS4UKNc1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I am a masters student at Concordia University, montreal, canada. I am
interested in the "Websockets" project that is listed on GSOC 2014 project
idea list.

I have checked the related project: http://socketo.me/ and seems to me the
approach could be:

1) Check whether server can offer opening new ports(which won't be possible
on shared servers etc).
2) If yes, dynamically create server to listen api calls. And set session
settings so that further API calls to be done here.

However, I am confused about few things:

* Does it required to be implemented as a modular independent plugin or as
a part of core?
* Which functionality/facility scope should be covered under this websocket
feature? I guess, all remote api, ajax calls could be done easily. Am I
wrong?

Wish to look forward to hear your feedbacks and further suggestions soon.

Regards

Rana

As you pointed out, most hosting environments won't be able to use it
at all. There's also client browsers that won't (including IE10
without flash installed).

That said, it would be implausible to redesign core components in a
way that absolutely relies on them. That's not to say they couldn't be
written in a way that allows them to take advantage of them assuming
you're able to effectively detect when both the server and client can
support it.

So I would definitely see this being developed as a plugin prototype
first, with the goal of providing an easy to use API that could
potentially let core features use it if it's available, but safely
fall back on traditional requests otherwise.

> * Which functionality/facility scope should be covered under this websocket

Current AJAX calls would certainly be the most obvious target for
optimization through this (especially the heartbeat API, which I think
may have considered WebSockets at one point), though it's probably a
lot harder than you think it is.

Something to keep in mind is that using WebSockets means that our
traditional PHP script lifecycle changes significantly. Specifically,
there will be cases where core API defines constants based on certain
requests and calls, and those constants need to *not* be defined for
additional WebSocket requests. WordPress is currently designed around
processing only one request at a time, knowing those constants will be
reset upon the next request. That won't be true for multiple WebSocket
requests.

You'll need to keep a close eye on where WordPress defines those
constants, and additionally anywhere it calls wp_die() - which would
also break the WebSocket connection.

That said, I'm sure you could still find good request type candidates
that aren't encumbered by those limitations, and could be easily roped
into a WebSocket workflow.

I'd also take a look at some existing WordPress plugins that already
use WebSockets for some inspiration. Here's a few I was able to find
quickly (I haven't looked at any of them):

https://wordpress.org/plugins/fcchat/

Should be able to use a MySQL utility to do some kind of search/replace.
Perhaps export to a .SQL file, use a text editor to remove the desired
text, and reimport it.

This are rewrite rules and can?t be added in MySQL since they will be regenerated. I would not recommend doing this unless you are knowing what you do. What isn?t the case here.
What you need to do is adjusting the rewrite rules for users but you need to do more. You also need to validate that pages (maybe posts too) don?t conflict with those.
So what you can do is rewrite those too but without the use case it?s hard to see what the right approach is.

Best,
Marko

I was assuming one would:

1) Build a test copy of the current setup on a local machine
2) Change the rewrite rules.
3) Write some new test posts to be sure the rules are the way you want
them.
4) Change the existing posts (as I suggested)
5) Test to make sure that you can see the old posts (and pages) via the
new rewrite rules.
6) Upload this test system to the live system.

But whatever, throwing your hands up and just forgetting the whole thing,
as you suggest, is also an option...

The solution can be something like:

1. add a rewrite rule(should be something like "^/([^/])/?" =>
"author=$matches[1]" ) with a high priority(so that it is before the WP
default rewrite rules).
2. Hook on parse_request action hook and see if it's a request for an
author page.
3. Check if author exists - if they do, do nothing. If the don't:
4. Check if verbose_page_rules is
true($wp_rewrite->use_verbose_page_rules). If it is - see if a page with
that slug exists.
5. Otherwise see if the request is for a post and if not, check for a page
with that slug.

You would need to dig into /wp-includes/rewrite.php in order to get a
better understanding of how the WordPress rewrite internals work.

Hello Ian,

Considering your review of my requirements for the Form / Survey Plugin, I
have been able to come up with a draft proposal,
it can be found @
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tPLCKGRCIWMgYP0kLWXjoSlddbYbT8FSj7VGfoDPolY/edit?usp=sharing


I would be glad if you can review my proposal.

Thanks and Best Regards

hello !

As I declared earlier that I'm interested in the idea View comments by post
in wordpress for Android and shared an idea of my own also(Sorting Feature
in Posts [1]). So I would like to get some suggestions on how to proceed
with Android git code. Which IDE would be the best to use (I''ve already
built the source code in Android studio successfully btw.) ?
I'm trying to understand the code these days and would appreciate any
further help. I tried to track the developers/mentors on IRC
(#wordpress-mobile) also but found none, may be

[1]  feature : Sorting in posts menu. The user can sort posts on the basis
of published posts, drafts and scheduled posts or by date/tags. It can be
implemented in the action bar menu by adding a new drop down menu group
with a filter like icon. The sorting/filtering algorithm can then be used
in the list adapter. Tags can be matched from the mt_keywords column and
post_status column can be used to filter on the basis of
drafts/scheduled/published posts.

Hi Amandeep -

Most of the contributors to WordPress for Android are now using Android
Studio.  If you're looking for some of the Android contributors in
#WordPress-Mobile try pinging mbiais since he's one of the mentors on
Android for Google Summer of Code.  A lot of us hang out in the room all
day long but only check it for activity once in a while.

I like your suggestion of having a filter/sort feature.  As with any new
feature, the user experience is key.  I'd suggest maybe drawing up a quick
sketch of your suggestion to share with the IRC chat room.  It definitely
would let us give you better feedback to see what you're thinking.

Cheers,

Aaron

Thanks Ian,

I would keep working on it to make it better.

Is the structure ok ? I used the 2013 GSoc WordPress Template.

Message-ID: <20140312132439.283998ff@mydesk>

Hi all,

How do you guys back up Wordpress sites? Do you just back
up the /var/www/blog (or whatever) and then use mysqldump to back up
the Wordpress database? 

Would the preceding work on a server where you're just one of many
users (like Bluehost, etc)? If not, how do you do it there, and how do
you test the restorability of your backup?

Thanks,

SteveT

I always store a backup away from the hosting account, "just in case".

BackupBuddy (not free) is an absolutely brilliant utility. It not only
makes backups automatic, including sending them to remote storage if you
have it, but it will do all of the database editing when you change a
domain (such as going from localhost development to the live server.) Worth
every single penny if you have more than a site or two to deal with, IMO. I
started looking into other products sold by the company because I'm so
rarely as impressed with the quality of software as I have been with BB.
http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/

I'm not affiliated with BB in any way. ;-)

Hey Steve,

That is one way of doing it. I usually ssh into the server, tar the
directory, log into mysql, dump the database and do what I wish with it...

Usually shared host (hostmonster, hostgator) don't allow ssh access?

the script goes along the lines of

cd {website directory}
tar -zcvf httpdocs.tar.gz {website directory}
{do what I want :) Move to Amazon s3, another server, download}

I wrote a script last summer and published it

https://github.com/marcelltisdol/StashHouse.sh

We host all of out sites on mediatemple so it's geared more towards that
crowd. However, if you modify it to your system it should work. Lemme know
:)

Top-rated backup and restore plugin on wordpress.org (4.9 stars out of 
5, from 630 reviews): http://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/

Premium version: http://updraftplus.com; cheaper than BackupBuddy and 
with more storage destinations.

I am biased. ;-)

Best wishes,
David

With shared hosts like Hostmonster you can get a dedicated IP in order to use ssh

Totally agreed. Started using BackupBuddy a couple of years ago and it's 
worth every penny. Have it sync'ing 30+ sites into Dropbox doing db 
backups daily and full site backups weekly. If worst comes to worst I 
can spin everything back up on a fresh server in under 30 minutes with 
minimal data loss.

rsync filesystem and mysqldump to different location, multiple times per
day. Code is always in a local git repo too (backed up of course).

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordCamp Mobile App
Message-ID: <CAG4A4GabtZJoA6ybkHvdT1bURr9ONGtd1qp+6ZzDxxYmCAbwFA@mail.gmail.com>

 I am Aneke Chimdindu, a student developer from University of Nigeria,
Nsukka.
Gone through the ideas on word press and "WordCamp Mobile App" seems to
fall into my niche.
I am proficient in java, python, html5, css, JS.
The wordcamp mobile app when done natively.




This is the recent mobile app which I developed
http://biblewazobia.appspot.com/
You can tour the site to see the look and greater details.

This is another web app I worked on that made it to the top 5  finals of
the Google Cloud Developer Challenge 2014 from Sub Saharan Africa
gcdc2013-prepjambites.appspot.com

Watch the app video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT2sbVhnfo4

I have been working on a mobile health app for doctors and nurses in
developing and village area, though not yet ready.

please, I need your feedback if I am on the right track to continue with
the project "WordCamp Mobile App"

Hello Bryan,

Thanks for your valuable feedbacks. I forgot about the browser/client side
compatibility. About the implementation part, I will follow the approach
you suggested and also thanks for those nice tips. I am also checking with
the plugin links you given. I will start preparing the proposal and get
back if I need any further clarifications.

Regards
Rana

Hi, your messages gave us some great background info on yourself, but 
didn't say anything about your ideas for the project, how you would 
approach implementing the requirements, etc. The mentor(s) for that 
project will need those kinds of details in order to give you any feedback.

Message-ID: <CAH9UVvE4qpthVaU+wjcc33AMUVDXj_dxtHVnGtstyCSM-3nvRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

Currently I maintain a plugin to enhance Quicktags to the text- and visual
editor.
But it is not possible to add buttons to the TinyMCE.
Is this a open issue in the current beta or it is important, that we test
more. With the 3.8.1 works all tests fine. I have also the problem, that
the text editor add all additional buttons twice.
I have tested also with default source, simple from the codex, no positiv
result.

Best regards
Frank

One more important note: I'd strongly recommend making sure that you're 
available for the whole term, because it's common for projects to take 
longer than expected or run into unforeseen obstacles. You're much more 
likely to be successful if you can focus on the project for the full summer.

That's not a problem, I probably worded my timeline incorrectly, but I am
available until end of term. I just won't be able to spend as much time as
I do when my break is on (I can put in almost 12-14 hours a day), but I
will be available for a few hours daily atleast after July second week.

Hi Frank

Seems like plugins that add TinyMCE plugins or custom code will need to be
updated for WP 3.9. Details can be found in ticket
#24067<https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067>.
Nacin mentioned it in the 3.9 Beta 1 announcement
post<http://wordpress.org/news/2014/03/wordpress-3-9-beta-1/>
.

Cheers

Pascal

Hello Bryan/Eric,
I have made a draft application for the project here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oB28xUdvA154JCvCioCha6wIP8otxnuoYuYk9J6Ylpk/edit?usp=sharing


I have also published the proposal part on my blog here:
http://codesamplez.com/websockets-plugin-for-wordpress

Looking forward to get some feedbacks and suggestions about it.

Also I have few questions as well:
* I think for this plugin, there will be need for some administration
settings as well(like configuring port(s) to use etc) . Do you have any
suggestions about the possible configurable options?
* In the application template, the 'Schedule of Deliverables' , is it OK to
put some rough estimation or if its required some preliminary discussion
with mentor, can I get your IRC handle please? I am with nick 'AliAhsanRana'

Regards
Rana

I'm working on my proposal for GSoC 2014, I decided to take the search

for the iOS app.

>From UX prospective, how the user should enter to search mode:
1) From button inside the Me viewControllr navigation bar.
2) Cell inside the Me tabelView where Posts, Pages, Comment, etc.

Does the search is supposed to be local on the result from server, Or send
request to WP server.

If is a server request, I'm trying to investigate the API request and
response for receiving the search result of posts and pages.

For now I figure that the iOS app use XML-RPC protocol to communicate with
wordpress server.

>From the Blog.h object in the iOS app it uses the API call to get the post
list is "wp.getPostFormats". In the documentation I didn't find how to
filter the result by search string.

I read somewhere that WP XML-RPC have can run WP_Query but i didn't
understand how.

Could you refer me to information for how should I implement get posts list
filtered by search string?
Thanks

Subject: [wp-hackers] [GSoC 2014] Proposal: Re-imagining Core Metaboxes
Message-ID: <CAN0R4u3SZv0Lno-rQdEJqPm--eHQyarex8DUQG9FEtYcseuR3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,


I'm a student at the University of Southern California. I've been
contributing to WordPress Core for about a year, most notably to Twenty
Fourteen, and have published nine plugins on WordPress.org, most notably
Fourteen Colors [see http://wordpress.org/plugins/fourteen-colors/].
WordPress.org and IRC username: celloexpressions.


I have several ideas for GSoC projects that I'm considering proposing, and
I'd like some input on them. For now, I'll just explain one - re-imagining
core metaboxes.


The post-writing screen is the heart of WordPress. Despite its visual
editor receiving ample attention and updates--especially in WordPress 3.9,
with TinyMCE 4.0--the rest of the screen feels dated and clunky. A new
approach to taxonomy metaboxes, as well as certain core metaboxes and the
layout of the screen in general would take inspiration from the ongoing
front-end-editor project (with the goal of creating a more unified
experience between the two editing modes). A few ideas I have initially
include those proposed by Mel Choyce and Joen Asmussen along with the
content blocks concept, and/or exploring an accordion approach similar to
that of the Theme Customizer [see http://moc.co/sandbox/post-formats/ and
http://choycedesign.com/wpadmin-ui/].


The following features would be considered in-scope: all taxonomies with
core UI (core & custom, hierarchical and non-hierarchical), featured
images, post formats (a special taxonomy), discussion, author, slug, and
everything currently housed in the publish metabox.


Any project that touches this screen needs to do so very carefully, as
millions of people use it daily. The problems that faced last year's Post
Formats UI project's attempts to change this page should be carefully
reviewed and considered (while most of the issues were with the concept of
that feature, there are lessons to be learned about changing the posting
screen in general).


User testing would be key to this project's success. Initially, I would
gather information about how people use WordPress and use it to create user
test scenarios. Then, I would run user tests on the current screen to
identify the problems that need to be addressed. Besides it not being the
most modern/streamlined design, I suspect several usability issues with the
current layout. Next, I would develop three prototype UIs, spending one
week working on each, and user-test all of these with the same test cases.
After evaluating the results of the tests, one UI concept would be selected
for full development and iterations.


This work would be developed in a plugin, but with every intention of being
added to core upon successful completion of the project. In order to assure
that this is a realistic goal, it would be critical to consult with other
core designers and developers on the approach taken for every major
decision. For this reason, I'm wondering if it would make sense to try
approaching this project like a "feature plugin" project. Many current
feature plugin projects have only one primary developer, so the requirement
of having only one person coding might not be as restrictive as it seems.
One of the most important aspects of the feature plugin process is having a
group of interested people providing feedback and direction throughout
development. Logistically, I would propose holding weekly meetings/office
hours for the project where anyone interested can discuss it, to supplement
the role of the mentor for broader UI/UX feedback.


Please let me know if you have any feedback about the process I've proposed
here, as well as the concept of this project in general.


Thank you for your time.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSOC 2014 idea: Media categories in Core
Message-ID: <CACg6fHFCeVZkM6tm27s0HHpYjDqksAHCK-U+DVWp1CQA7CasVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to the Wordpress Community but I've already worked with Wordpress
for some time. I would like to contribute to the community and take part in
GSOC 2014.

My idea is to add categorization to the Media Library. This means that when
you add files, you can select category for them. The category can be
selected from predefined categories list, just like it is currently done
when you add posts. Moreover, if you checked "Organize my uploads into
category folders" your media files will be stored in category folders,
which is great. Finally, when you add media files to your post or page you
can browse media by categories so you don't have to browse through
thousands of not related images to find a particular one.

Now you would probably say that there are plugins which can do that. This
is true but those plugins, despite the fact that they look ugly, they
always miss something. For example, even if you find a plugin that allows
you to categorize media properly, still you won't be able to browse with
categories when adding media files to posts/pages or to browse with
categories when making a gallery. Moreover, you will have to move you media
files to created category folders manually. In other words -- media
categorization must be in the core :)

I would like to ask for your opinion concerning this idea. Do you think it
qualifies for GSOC 2014?

Best regards,
Adam

Hi Shachar,

The search can be local to what is cached in the app.

Feel free to stop by #wordpress-mobile in freenode IRC and chat with 
some of the app devs if you have questions. :)

Hi Aarushi,

The idea behind this project is it would be great if there was a way for 
a user to view all the comments for a particular post, perhaps as a list 
on some kind of post detail screen.  Ideally a user would be able to 
view, moderate, reply, and edit those comments, just as they would from 
the existing comments feature in the Android and iOS apps.  If its 
helpful, WordPress for Windows Phone already has this functionality.

For a GSoC project, you'd probably want to pick either iOS or Android, 
but not both.

You're also welcome to come chat with GSoC mentors in #wordpress-gsoc 
and with the mobile devs in #wordpress-mobile in IRC on freenode.net.

Cheers,
Eric

Hi Adam, how long do you think it would take to create a plugin with 
that functionality? The project needs to be big enough to fill ~3 months.

I have been using add_rewrite_rule() for a long time, but now I am in a place
where I am rewriting about a dozen urls.  Looking for a simpler solution, I
came upon  generate_rewrite_rules
<https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/generate_rewrite_rules>  
but the documentation is sparse. 

Has anyone here made use of this action?  If so, could you share the what
the proper application is, and any example code you have showing its proper
use?

Okay, so let's say if I were to pick up Android, how should I go on about
it? And what are the prerequisite skills for doing this project? And where
should I start from?

H Aarushi,

A good starting point would be to read through the Android section of 
the mobile handbook:
http://make.wordpress.org/mobile/handbook/

And to start getting familiar with the android code base:
https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android

Cheers
Eric

Hey Eric and Aarushi,

Awais Imran here (IRC: waisybabu). I was reading the conversation 
between you, and Aarushi. I am interested in working on the WordPress 
for Android app as well. For now, I am considering if I should work on 
either 'Mobile In-App Search for Posts, Pages, and Comments' or 'View 
Comments by Post', or both.

I have beginner-level experience with Android development, having 
co-developed a popular screenshot utility called 'ShotDrop'. It has 
received over 25,000+ downloads on the Play Store, so far. I do not 
consider myself an expert, but I am a quick, self-motivated learner.

What would you recommend for me to do?

Thank you for the info. The plugin you suggested is one of the best 
among media categories/taxonomy plugins. However, it lacks some features 
that I would like to include (in core media library):

1. no category filter in "insert media",
2. no upload directly to category,
3. media still organized in 'year-month' order, not according to categories.

Hi Awais,

Its up to you to decide. :)  I suggest you look into what would be 
needed for each project, then decide which one you feel more comfortable 
with, and which one interests you the most.

Hi Ian,

I think that creating such a functionality as a plugin would take less than
3 months. However, making it as a core functionality, considering proper
testing and contributor's handbook for proper coding and project
organization, it would fit to 3 months.
I believe that such a functionality included in a new wordpress release
would be appreciated by the users. What do you think?

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2014: WebSockets in WordPress
Message-ID: <CAKkg9Nx7CZSk+MQ1LGqcddmCSPA+VLukyrHJOJuSYpt_VLDBtA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

For quite some time since I started following the development of React and
Ratchet, I have been intrigued by the idea of using WebSockets together
with WordPress. Although on Apache installations a WebSocket server would
still require running an additional process, it provides many potential
benefits for both users and developers.

By using Ratchet, I plan to write a WebSocket API which could be used for
plugin development. It should ease the creation of real-time solutions,
like new comments and posts notifications, chat systems and live updates of
the site's components (for example, automatically displaying new content to
all users as soon as it becomes available without a browser refresh).

Besides the use of WebSockets, I am also thinking of using the React server
for serving request, which could provide a significant performance boost,
as mentioned in this post:
http://marcjschmidt.de/blog/2014/02/08/php-high-performance.html

During the time working in a small company, I had to go through WordPress
theme and plugin development. Also, I had developed several applications
with Node.js/PHP + React and WebSockets and I believe it would be a great
experience combining my skills while improving such a successful project.

What are your thoughts on the idea? Any feedback would be useful. :)

That article is pretty nice, and even points out some of the downsides
and technical issues involved, which are also very critical to
WordPress as well, so let me just briefly cover them to the best of my
knowledge.

1. While Symfony contains a Request/Response system that he talks
about in that article, in WordPress, it's much worse. A bunch of core
functions and plugins directly access superglobals for $_REQUEST and
$_SERVER values. As pointed out, those are entirely unreliable in the
environment of asynchronous requests.
2. Also a problem for asynchronous requests: hooks. These are bound by
global context, meaning hooks would have no idea what request/client
was being served, which DB resource to use (what if we were in a
transaction?), or what output stream to echo out to. ReactPHP was
built with MVC architectures and template engines in mind - neither of
which we use. And as far as backwards compatibility goes, there's
likely nothing we can do to handle any of those while staying
compatible with existing plugins.

So, even if we managed to work our way around blocking IO calls (PDO,
DNS, etc), this means that we still can't use async requests. It's
best to just forget about it (especially for GSoC). That doesn't mean
we can't still use WebSockets or React, it just means that we can't
use async/promise. Of course, this defeats most of the performance
gains React likes to gloat about, but it would still cut back on PHP
initialization.

Unfortunately, without async, this introduces another problem. It
means we will be performing blocking calls (which was likely going to
happen anyway with PDO). And since we'll be blocking, we won't want
one user blocking requests from another user, so we would likely want
to avoid re-using connections across sessions. We probably already
want to anyway since authorization checks also rely on request/session
identity stored in global values. This is a difficult task which I'm
not sure has a solution with a fixed server pool configuration. It's
not going to scale with 50+ concurrent admin users (including authors
writing posts) leaving heartbeat WebSockets open to individual PHP
processes on different ports.

Maybe I'm wrong about some of this, and hopefully someone else on the
list can correct me or point out other solutions I'm not aware of to
these problems. But this is all probably worth some discussion before
any students jump head-first into this for GSoC.

Regards,
Bryan Petty

Bryan Petty, thank you for the valuable feedback. After what you have
pointed out, which seems valid, for me it looks like the whole purpose of
using React (and Ratchet) is lost. Since we have to use another process for
WebSockets anyway, we may as well use another language or server (for
instance Node.js).

Still, I suppose a PHP WebSocket server will still be available as an
option on cheaper hosting solutions, which are the main platform for
WordPress.

In that case, I guess the only viable option for the WebSockets project is
to write a plugin which check if it is possible to open a separate
connection and if so, to start a WebSocket server and expose an API which
could be used by other plugins. One of the other candidates has already
offered to work on that.

With kind regards,
Atanas

Message-ID: <CAN0R4u3U_7J34wmANxZiVHAGLYS1E9npkAe4JbtdMkanNHTLoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello again,

I'd like to outline another idea I have for GSoC and get some feedback. The
Theme Customizer has slowly been gaining traction among developers and
users since its introduction two years ago, and has received sizable
improvements in 3.9 with the addition of Widgets and improved support for
header images. There is still a lot more to do, so I've identified a number
of items that could be implemented as a GSoC project:

   - Adding menu management to the customizer (that is, editing menus
   directly, not just setting theme locations)
   - Adding theme-switching to the customizer (would require re-loading it
   entirely, but would be very useful)
   - Re-do the background image feature to work better with the new headers
   UI and incorporate the media library
   - Eliminate the existing header/background pages in favor of the
   customizer, as the customizer provides a better solution for these (only
   when customizer is available; wouldn't make sense to do this for widgets,
   menus, or themes)
   - Add more built-in controls; for example, a select-type control that
   allows users to select a value based on an image (useful for colorschemes,
   layouts, etc), a range/slider input type, basic number input type, etc.
   - Better documentation: fill-out the codex/handbook pages, perhaps
   create an example plugin with example usage of different levels of
   difficulty
   - Address the problem of losing changes when leaving the customizer
   (without implementing autosave/revisions for theme_mods, which would be an
   entire project in itself)
   - Better showcase the customizer in bundled themes: development of
   features for Twenty Fifteen (near end of project if timelines allow),
   improvements to older bundled themes
   - Improve access to the customizer from the front-end: perhaps make it
   more like a toggle in/out of customize mode? Remove or deep-link the
   appearance menu in the front-end toolbar.

I've created trac tickets related to some of these ideas previously. From
the above list I'd like to select a few items that together would be about
the right scope for a GSoC project; for example, either menus or themes
could take about half of the time to implement in a core way. If anyone has
ideas as to what should be prioritized (or if any are invalid), that would
be very helpful for creating a specific/final proposal.

Parts of this would be developed in plugins designed for eventual merging,
other parts would be best implemented as core patches. Any feedback you
have is much appreciated!

Thanks!

Hi Arul, I'll let the mobile devs comment on the implementation details, 
but in general it looks good to me.

Doesn't the WordPress iOS app already provide this functionality? I
don't have an iOS device to test with quickly here, but I know that
the WordPress Android app already does this exactly as the platform
has intended it to be provided.

Maybe I'm just not quite correctly understanding the scope with which
we would need a separate API just to provide this functionality in
addition to the platform's built-in sharing mechanisms that users are
already familiar with, nor why a 3rd party app would want to implement
this instead of using the built-in APIs that are designed to allow
sharing anything with any number of other networks besides just a WP
blog based on other installed applications.

Bryan Petty

Nevermind, I guess reading into this a bit has made me realize that
this doesn't actually exist on iOS.

Certainly explains why projects like this exist:

Thanks for your feedbak !

In iOS each application is (unfortunately ?) sandboxed and it's not possible
to communicate from one to an other.
Nevertheless Apple provides developpers with "Custom Url Schemes"
http://www.idev101.com/code/Objective-C/custom_url_schemes.html

It allows an iOS app to pass data to an other app. (If the receiver app has
handlers to these kind of calls)

Since the iOS worpdress application is currently using some custom urls, the
idea is to develop a library to use them super easily for every developers
and to contribute to the expansion of Wordpress

By the way, after some comments on IRC, I've updated my proposal :

	Pipeline
Message-ID: <CAKkg9NyrtXg60ayoSaYn_uWoM1A2tkg+xHza6PnLfXrhafAWOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I am interested in writing a Plugin Dependency Manager solution for
WordPress. However, I was wondering if that manager is supposed to look for
other plugins as requirements or only for assets?

If it is the first case, every plugin developer will have to follow a
specification. Furthermore, as the minimum requirements for WordPress are
below PHP 5.3, we cannot use PHP namespaces for plugins which makes the
task more complex. Even so, if a healthy plugin dependency manager is
developed, I believe the WordPress ecosystem will become more solid.

However, if we are only interested in assets loading, we could look into
somehow implementing Bower or a similar custom solution (maybe in
conjunction with with Grunt, which WordPress is already using). In that
case, the plugins dependency project overlaps with the Asses Pipeline
project and I will be happy working on them.

What are you thoughts and advices? Any help would be appreciated.

With kind regards,

Atanas-

I don't know what the spec is supposed to be, but had a few thoughts on
this.

I would suggest you search Otto's site for the article he wrote on handling
plugin dependencies in themes. The code in there would be a good place to
start, or at least study, as it doesn't require anything besides plugins
having a valid header.


Also, have you seen http://wpackagist.org/ ? It could allow a dependency
manager to use composer without having to require plugin developers to
manually add composer support, which isn't feasible.

Take care,
Josh

Hi Jasawnt, welcome :)

There've been a lot of discussions on that project already, so the first 
thing to do would be to review them.

http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/
http://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-gsoc

After that, go ahead and work up a proposal using the template on the 
Codex page and submit it for feedback.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Redundant rewrite rules help
Message-ID: <1395349996997-43747.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have a number of rewrite rules, and they all are prefaces with the same
initial rule;

    add_rewrite_rule('member/([^/]+)$', 'index.php?member=$matches[1]',
'top');

If I have another page after member, it would look like this;


    add_rewrite_rule('member/([^/]+)/second_var/?$',
'index.php?member=$matches[1]&second_var=second_var', 'bottom');


Is there a way to automatically include the top level rewrite rule on all
the rest?  I am trying to make this more dynamic, and this makes it
difficult.

Hi Dragoon,

Apologies I haven't got to this earlier, 

Indeed the project and idea still has merit.

I've taken a quick look at your proof of concept.

If you take a look at the work that previously gone into this idea in bbPress ticket #459 you will see that we have created a custom taxonomy to store the forum moderators and forums that they are moderators of.

https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/459/459.4.diff

We'd want to build out on that per the GSoC project idea to scope it out further to also cover "per-post" permissions which would enhance the flexibility of what we can and cannot do with the forum, topic and reply custom post types.

I suggest you create a proposal per the codex http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2014#How_to_Apply 

Cheers,
?

Hello guys, I've been crafting my proposal and I would like to hear your
opinions about it.

You can read a description of my project here:
http://schemaautointegrationplugin.wordpress.com/

It is still not fully finished, but at least you get a pretty general idea
of what I am trying to accomplish.

By per post permission, it would extend to any custom post type or limited
to bbPress? Now this is entirely possible for meta capabilities and rather
simply but what about the general capabilities? Say I want to grant a
specific user "reply" in a specific forum, I'd need to modify bbPress
itself in order to pass the forum ID

Okay, I was wrong. This seems perfectly capable with plugins, I can use
$post global variable and user_has_caps filter similar to this proof of
concept <https://gist.github.com/Dragooon/9683271>. I'll quickly write a
proposal before the deadline

Subject: [wp-hackers] get wp_query object when you have url to post
Message-ID: <CAGhUOaCx+D5zomZrQQPE5Wp0w0e_3f=yTSem6THP16pT78Gnww@mail.gmail.com>

hi

Imagine that you have some text (let it be a post content) with urls. I
want to take all urls (it is something what i know how to do), check if the
links are local (again, something easy) and if they are, check what exactly
should be queried from wordpress, what should be in wp_query.

Does wordpress has some easy function/methid to do this?

Like get_wp_query_by_url('http://example.com/archive/some-category-name')
which will return wp_query for 'some-category-name' archive page.

Another question, maybe more suitable for me: does wordpress has some easy
function/method which will return $_GET params which should be set when we
want to open this url?

Something like get_query_params_by_url('http://example.com/some-post');
which will return:

array(
'p' => 12
)

(params which normally will be added as $_GET to url if permalinks are set
to default)

Thank you in advance. Now everything what i do is to get url, slice it to
get its path and compare it with wp_rewrite. But because wordpress somehow
knows what it must display if somebody type some url in address bar i am
little affraid that there is some easier method than manual checking if url
matches to wp_rewrite rules

Actually WordPress does the same thing internally(well it's a bit more
complicated, but it's about the same) - it goes through all rewrite rules
until it finds a matching regex pattern.

You might be able to run the method that generates the query, but I don't
know if it won't have a performance hit(especially if you'll be running it
for multiple links).

What is the reason behind why you need this functionality?

could you show me where it happen? which part of code?

i want to look on this and check how it is done and if it can inspire me

Actually i don't need but i must ;) I work now on some legacy code, which
doesn't work correctly and is quite messy. I see only that it iterates
wp_rewrite rules and match links. I want to check if i can rewrite it in
better way. I tried to patch it but it looks now that it already has too
much patches which just fix one issue and do next one. Code has now about
500 lines and i feel that it is too much.

Hi Ian,

Could I ask you for some feedback concerning my GSoC application? There is
still some time left before the deadline. I've put the application on my
blog:
http://czyszczon.com.pl/gsoc-2014-wordpress-proposal-media-categories-in-core/
Full application is already submitted on GSOC website.

Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter :)
Adam

Adam,
At this point you should move the questions/commenting to the 
application comments section, so that all the reviewing mentors can see 
what's said.

You can find the code in /wp-includes/class-wp.php WP::parse_request -
https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/3.8-branch/wp-includes/class-wp.php#L120


If you scroll down to line 199, you will see the foreach loop over the
rewrite rules.

Bad code written by other people is bad :)

I pulled up your application and it looks like Mike has already started 
giving you some feedback. Myself and the other mentors will be viewing 
it and giving feedback over the next few weeks.

Personal information

Name: Laurentiu-George Stamate

Email Address: laurentiustamate94 at yahoo.com

School: I am attending at University Politehnica of Bucharest.

Major: My major is Computer Science. 

 
 
About me

I will spend this summer in Bucharest, Romania in the UTC +2 timezone.

In highschool I founded a small team and we focused mainly on developing websites for various companies and last year I founded a company. Our website is => http://www.eselgi.com

I am an experienced developer on all the platforms you requested. With HTML and JS I started back in primary school and with PHP OOP, MySQL and C# in highschool.

 
 
Timeline

April, 20 ? May, 11 (three weeks) ? Continuos documentation. I will ask my mentor questions if there is anything unclear for me (I will always be online on IRC and/or on other IM protocol).

May, 11 ? June, 11 (one month) - I will sketch up a design, work on developing a basic functionality app and report my work in order to have a permanent feedback, and enhance any change.

June, 4 ? July, 1 (~3 weeks) ? I have my final exams at my faculty and I will work a little less during this period. I will write few lines of code and/or propose ideas and/or minor bug fixes during this period. 

July, 1 ? July, 8 (~1 week) ? Bug solving issues. By now, the application is expected to 50-60% finished.

July, 8 ? July, 13 (5 days or less) ? Preparing the mid-term report and submitting it to Google.

July, 13 ? August, 3 (3 weeks) ? Coding and discussing with my mentor about solutions in order to efficiently gain information about table structures and/or other components.

August, 3 ? August, 17 (2 weeks) ? I will be on my summer holiday so I wont be able to work :-)

August, 17 ? August, 24 (1 week or less) ? writing final report

 
The schedule may suffer minor modifications, depending on the way the project evolves. If I will finish some important parts earlier, maybe I will take several days (3 - 4) off. After 1st of July I will finish with any tasks I have to do for my university, and I will certainly have double amount of time to code. 

 
 
Why Me

I'm very eager to start working on any of the projects discussed above. I have participated in many IT project competitions during my high-school and now, in faculty, and I have enjoyed working for them, since any new challenge requests a lot of new knowledge in order to successfully compete and win.

I am high-level in C# (I also have a certification on Software Fundamentals which I won ranking 2nd in a C# contest), PHP, SQL, JS, and mid-level in Python, Java programming.

Hey,

Sorry for the late response. I?m just seeing this e-mail. We already include a plugin to enable Google translate and I?m not seeing what you want to add here.

Best,

Marko

Subject: [wp-hackers] Network Installation for multisites
Message-ID: <CALh8u3=n_84DUSWLN7o9bABvPFuPaPSZCuf9KBDor5d7b2cjcw@mail.gmail.com>

While installing the network it is asked of a user to add the following
lines:

define('MULTISITE', true);
define('SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false);
define('DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'localhost');
......

in the wp-config.php and also various changes are required to be made to
the .htaccess file.

I'm a little curious as to why can't these changes be made automatically
using file handling in php? Is there some specific reason for not
implementing it this way?
( Currently using version 3.8 )

Thanks.

I'm just wildly guessing here, but maybe one of the reasons is because a
multisite network is more complex than a normal WordPress site - meaning
that the administrator of a network should have a bit more technical
knowledge and you would most-likely need FTP access to your site anyway.

Besides you already have to add a line of code to your wp-config.php in
order to enable network installation, so it's not a big hassle to put the
lines of code yourself.

Again - that was just a guess, so if anyone has concrete knowledge on the
matter I'd be very interested in learning about the reasoning.

Why not even add the "define( 'WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true );" dynamically
using file parsing. We could provide a simple Enable network button to do
this. It would certainly be a step towards making the multisite network
available and easy to setup (for everyone). I dunno why this wasn't done
earlier. Maybe because it was slowing things down? ( file parsing does take
a large amount of time )

we have wp-cli for automating multisites in seconds. have you tried it? it
has lots of addons to automate many things.

I'd say that most of the users of WordPress don't really need a multisite
network - just because it exists doesn't mean that everyone needs it. And
the philosophy of WordPress regarding options is more or less along the
lines of "each option that is offered puts the decision on the user - which
makes it less user-friendly".

So if you want to have a network you will look it up and do it yourself.

Much of the time, users who think they want a multi-site really aren't sure
what they're getting into. When you explain the difference between
"multiple WordPress sites" and "multi-site," many opt to use multiple sites.

Also, without a few extraordinary plugins, WP's multi-site operation leaves
a bit lacking in my opinion.

I suspect, without having looked into the history, that it's more just
because WP doesn't have any way to do it, and WPMU was the forgotten
step-child until integration into core.

As far as I know, WP doesn't have any way to modify existing PHP files
automatically (although it has similar for htaccess), and WPMU wasn't
too user-focussed, so it was a low priority.

I'd hazard a guess that a well-written ticket and patch to do this
automatically wouldn't be rejected. :)

So if you want to have a network you will look it up and do it yourself.

All of this is accurate.

We didn't need to introduce WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE; we could have edited
wp-config.php for you; we could have made it so multisite didn't require
wp-config.php changes. In fact, we wrote the patches for all of this back
in 3.0 (during the WPMU merge) and decided against them.

WordPress multisite is deliberately a pain to install because it's not for
everyone. We need to make it easier to use and to manage before we make it
easier to install. That especially means eliminating more of the "gotchas"
and quirks, smoothing over the arbitrary difference between single-site and
multisite, etc. One thing that will help us here is breaking down existing
paradigms and creating new ones. For example, introducing the general
concept of open registration versus trusted networks will help us with the
arbitrary differences. [1]

I don't think we're going to be in this situation forever, as multisite is
seeing incremental improvements with every version now. A number of
contributors are increasingly putting their efforts squarely into making
multisite better, in many cases because it's their full-time job to run a
complex WordPress network (woop Jeremy Felt). In 3.9, for example, the
entire loading process got rewritten, which gets us closer to arbitrary
domain/path support.

tl;dr: Until it's straightforward enough for someone untechnical to use
multisite for a second blog for their cat, the installation process will
continue to be a set of hoops. For the cat, to, err, jump through.

still tl;dr: when multisite sucks less we'll make it easier to install.

Hey
I applied for the 'view comments from posts section in android' idea and
uploaded my proposal here [1]. I'm waiting for comments by the mentors. I
would like to discuss upon the ideas shared there.

My project is on wp-android app. So what should be the best way to modify
and test the code ? And how to show the changes to mentors. Should I make a
request on wp repo or commit to my own repository

Also, what if I want to make changes in my proposal now ? The gsoc proposal
page says that the organization can unlock the edit proposal option.

Hi,

I have a website with pages using various shortcodes. When I run a

unformatted output of those shortcodes. How can I disable them so that 
they don't appear in the search result page? Is there a way to target 
specific shortcodes?

Nicholas, you saved my day ;)

In case other people are interested in the solution:

|$exclude_codes = 'shortcode_to_keep_1|keep_this_shortcode|another_shortcode_to_keep';

$the_content = get_the_content();
$the_content= preg_replace("~(?:\[/?)(?!(?:$exclude_codes))[^/\]]+/?\]~s", '', $the_content);  # strip shortcodes, keep shortcode content
|


Thank you

It would probably be best to just maintain commits on your own fork
for now, but I'll let someone else more familiar with the preferred
workflow for WPAndroid take this question.

I think they would prefer that you just leave comments on your
proposal explaining any changes so everyone is notified about them,
and you can still do that right now.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Remove wp_enqueue_style called mid-page
Message-ID: <5332F90F.1080400@duechiacchiere.it>

Hi all,

I am using a plugin that does a wp_enqueue_style mid-page, instead of 
using the appropriate hook. This causes the CSS to be added to the 
footer, which I would like to avoid.

Aside from contacting the plugin author, is there a way to dequeue that 
style so that I can enqueue it in the header? I would like to avoid 
editing the plugin's source code to comment out that line of code ;)

I've tried a bunch of combinations of actions/dequeue/deregister, to no 
avail.

Thanks,
Dino.

If you simply enqueue it in time for the header, it should print in the
header and not print it again in the footer.

Hi Dino,

Have you tried simply enqueueing that style? In theory WP shouldn't render
the same style/script twice.

function my_enqueue_plugin_style() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'plugin-style' );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_enqueue_plugin_style' );

If the plugin doesn't register the style all the way until it's enqueued,
then it'd be a bit more tricky, but something like this should work:

function my_dequeue_plugin_style() {
    wp_dequeue_style( 'plugin-style' );
}
add_action( 'wp_footer', 'my_dequeue_plugin_style' );

function my_enqueue_plugin_style() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'plugin-style', $url_to_plugin_css_file );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_enqueue_plugin_style' );

Amandeep -

We're in #wordpress-gsoc and #wordpress-mobile pretty much all the time.
 We may not be at our keyboard, but I suggest pinging one of us by
mentioning our username and our IRC client will let us know someone is
trying to reach us.

Cheers,

Aaron

Basically, there's a hook, but it doesn't actually do anything useful?

Subject: [wp-hackers] End-user exploitable local file inclusion
 vulnerability in Ajax Pagination (twitter Style) 1.1
Message-ID: <53356C28.6080901@dxw.com>

Details
================
Software: Ajax Pagination (twitter Style)
Version: 1.1
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/ajax-pagination/
CVSS: 9.3 (High; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Description
================
End-user exploitable local file inclusion vulnerability in Ajax 
Pagination (twitter Style) 1.1

Vulnerability
================
This plugin contains a file inclusion vulnerability that is exploitable 
by an unauthenticated user. The user can include any local file ending 
in ?.php? which is accessible to the web user.

Proof of concept
================
A non-logged in user can call the ajax function 
wp_ajax_nopriv_ajax_navigation that calls ajax_navigation_callback in 
ajax-pagination-front.php at line 75.
By setting the value of ?loop? in the POST data, they can include the 
contents of that path on the returned page.
For example, to include the contents of wp-login.php in the returned 
page, send the following:
POST /wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Content-Length: 53
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
paged=2&action=ajax_navigation&loop=../../../wp-login


Mitigations
================
Disable the plugin until a fix is available.

Disclosure policy
================
dxw believes in responsible disclosure. Your attention is drawn to our 
disclosure policy: https://security.dxw.com/disclosure/

Please contact us on security at dxw.com to acknowledge this report if you 
received it via a third party (for example, plugins at wordpress.org) as 
they generally cannot communicate with us on your behalf.

Please note that this vulnerability will be published if we do not 
receive a response to this report with 14 days.

Timeline
================

2014-02-18: Reported to nuwan28 at gmail.com and plugins at wordpress.org
2014-03-28: No response received to reports. Vulnerability published.

Subject: [wp-hackers] XSS,
 CSRF and blind SQL injection in GD Star Rating 1.9.22 (WordPress
 plugin)
Message-ID: <53356CFF.7090103@dxw.com>

Details
================
Software: GD Star Rating
Version: 1.9.22
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/gd-star-rating/
CVSS: 8.5 (High; AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:N/A:C)

Description
================
XSS, CSRF and blind SQL injection in GD Star Rating 1.9.22

Vulnerability
================
This plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection. Carrying out an SQL 
injection requires access to an administrator account. However, the form 
contains no CSRF protection and is also vulnerable to XSS so an attacker 
may not need direct access to an account to perform denial of service or 
to compromise sensitive data.

Proof of concept
================
Proof of concept (see code/adm/db.php at line 154):
<form 
action="http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-star-rating-stats" 
method="POST">
   <input type="text" name="s" value="' and sleep(5) = '">
   <input type="text" name="gdsr_search" value="Search Posts">
   <input type="submit">
</form>

Mitigations
================
Disable the plugin until a fix is released.

Disclosure policy

dxw believes in responsible disclosure. Your attention is drawn to our

Version: 1.2
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-html-sitemap/
CVSS: 4.3 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF vulnerability in WP HTML Sitemap 1.2

Vulnerability
================
A CSRF vulnerability exists which allows an attacker to delete the 
sitemap if a logged-in admin user visits a link of the attacker?s choosing.
Line 202 of inc/AdminPage.php says ?// check whether form was just 
submitted? but the following if/elseif statements only check whether a 
particular button was pressed without checking nonce values. The form in 
question is printed in wp_html_sitemap_AdminPage::createSitemapForm() 
around line 146 of the same file.

Proof of concept
================
This form deletes the sitemap without requiring a nonce value:
<form 
action="http://not-a-real-site.local/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-html-sitemap&tab=general" 
method="POST">
<input type="text" name="deleteSitemap" value="Delete Sitemap">

Woot. I'd seen that patch, but didn't follow the whole thread.

Guess I'll just follow along with this tutorial and see how it goes:

Hi Daniel,

This vulnerability was reported to plugins at wordpress.org on 2nd 
February. The author has not responded, so we are disclosing the 
vulnerability in order that anyone using this plugin can take steps to 
protect themselves.

This is certainly not an advertisement.

Administrivia: It was my assumption that this list would be interested 
to know about vulnerable plugins. If anyone has strong feelings for or 
against that assumption, please let me know off-list. If there is a 
consensus we will honour it.

Cheers,

Harry

I think Daniel was refering to posting to a public list, some malicious
people could take advantage of this, and cause some havoc.

Hi Chris,

We're aware of that, but not sure what alternative there is if the 
people who write plugins don't contact us when we report issues to them. 
We try to give people enough time to fix things, but if it doesn't look 
like they're going to, we believe it is the responsible thing to do to 
publish vulnerabilities so that people affected by them can take steps 
to protect themselves.

Our disclosure policy is here <https://security.dxw.com/disclosure/>, 
and we always draw people's attention to it (see below). All that said, 
it is a difficult area and I'm certainly open to suggestions about how 
to do it better.

Harry

Hi Harry,

There must be hundreds or thousands of plugin with security issues. I
don't think everybody will be interested to know vulnerabilities in
them.

I guess most of the user of the plugin are not going to read this.

## Chris replied, on Mar 28 @ 12:20pm (AMT):

I also disagree with how the issues are being disclosed.
 First off 14 days really isn't a long enough time. Imagine this
scenario:
 Day 1: Friday: Reported to WP Security team
 Day 1: Security team sends email to plugin author
 Day 4: Monday: Plugin author begins reading his emails about his
plugins that came in over the weekend and notices security email.
 Day 7: Thursday: Assuming the bug is easy to fix, an update is patch
is submitted as an update to WordPress.org
 Day 8: Update notifications begin to appear in WordPress backend,
given its now Friday, most users (if they even log into their site on
Fridays, will put off updating it till Monday mostly so they can read
through the changelog.
 Day 11: Users read through changelog and *hopefully* begin updating.

 The problem is, this made 2 assumptions. First, you assume all
security vulnerabilities are both easy to fix, and the plugin can be
re-audited quickly. While most are likely easy to fix (ala the ones
reported thus far), most authors would also want to re-audit their
plugins codebase, and for anything over 100k LOC that's going to take
a lot of time. Second, you've only given users 3 days to update in
this scenario. Some users will not update the first week after an
update has been patched. Some not even the first 2 weeks. Maybe they
are enterprise or large business sites where they have to get approval
and independent testing must be done prior to accepting the patch.
Maybe, they are scared of updates for whatever reason and they want to
read reports the update hasn't broken someone's site first.

 In any event, the "14 days" should be upped to the industry standard
30 days. Currently, in a good case scenario (like the one above)
you've given users 3 days to update before you reveal a direct proof
of concept of how to exploit the vulnerability.

 Even after 30 days, publishing a complete example of how to use the
vulnerability is still not all too responsible. I would move to a
system where you say what you can do to mitigate the issue after 30,
and then hold off on proof of concept for 60-90 days post report.

 Finally, I'd have to agree with the others. Posting vulnerability
reports here isn't going to alert the majority of the affected users,
and it has that spammy feel (even though its not spam).

Hi Daniel,

 This vulnerability was reported to plugins at wordpress.org on 2nd
 February. The author has not responded, so we are disclosing the
 vulnerability in order that anyone using this plugin can take steps
to
 protect themselves.

 This is certainly not an advertisement.

 Administrivia: It was my assumption that this list would be
interested
 to know about vulnerable plugins. If anyone has strong feelings for
or
 against that assumption, please let me know off-list. If there is a
 consensus we will honour it.

 Cheers,

Hi Chris,

The 14 days is just to acknowledge the report, not to release a fix. The 
policy does not prescribe a time for fixes for exactly the reasons 
you've outlined. We'll always work with people to agree a reasonable 
time for fixing and publication, unless they don't reply to us. In which 
case, we can't do much other than publish. We also generally do wait 
longer than 14 days, as you can see from these reports.
> Posting vulnerability reports here isn't going to alert the majority of the affected users, and it has that spammy feel (even though its not spam).
I'll add you to the list! So far, we're 1 for and 1 against.

Harry

@Chris - they are actually giving plugin authors 14 days to acknowledge the
report - which I assume means to just send an email along the lines of
"Okay, I'll take care of that ASAP". And again - 14 days is not a long time
- sometimes I'd away(and without internet access) for more than that.

I do agree that posting a proof of concept is not a good idea so soon. For
instance Wordfence sends out emails to their subscribers when plugin
vulnerabilities have been found(and usually when their users have suffered
from those vulnerabilities) and suggest what action users should take. For
instance "Plugin author has responded and patch is available in the next
release, available now", or "disable and delete plugin until a patch is
released or "contact plugin author".

I'm honestly not sure how to respond to that. I don't think I know 
anyone who doesn't care about having an exploitable website. I agree 
that there are hundreds of vulnerable plugins. That's what we're trying 
to help fix, because it's unacceptable!

> I guess most of the user of the plugin are not going to read this.
We'll do the best we can to make sure everyone who is interested will 
find out. We currently:

  * Publish to our website
  * Tweet from @dxwsecurity
  * Post to wp-hackers and Full Disclosure
  * Request a CVE

If you have any ideas about how we can spread the word more, I'm all ears.

Harry

If reports are acknowledged, and plugin authors keep us in the loop, 
we've so far always published on the same day as an update is released, 
with advice to update to the new version as soon as possible. I think 
the only circumstances under which we might publish sooner than that 
would be for a very serious vulnerability that the plugin author was not 
taking seriously.

I'd suggest creating a mailing list - this way people can actually opt-in
to those emails(so people here that don't want to receive that kind of
information will not and those who want can sign-up for it).

Just by way of comparison Google give you 7 days, I think 14 days is fine. I tend to give companies 30days to have the patch out, unless they give me a good reason to delay.

Anyone else agree? Who'd join such a list?

I'll keep a tally on that too.

Though I am a bit surprised at the respondents here who *don't* want to 
know about vulnerable plugins they may be running...

I think a separate mailing list would be a better idea than posting to
wp-hackers, for the same reason there are separate mailing lists and
separate IRC channels and separate development blogs for all the various
aspects of WordPress.

A separate list with more obvious way of joining would benefit regular
users - they can just fill-out a form and get updates. And when they do get
updates, they will be specifically targeted at security.

I'm pretty happy with the mailing list of Wordfence - they have a huge user
base with all kinds of different setups that they can monitor and find
exploits.

PS: I'm not saying that your reports are worthless - the idea is a very
good one and I'm happy that you are donating some of your time towards the
community.

Subject: [wp-hackers] CSRF vulnerability in WP HTML Sitemap 1.2
	(WordPress plugin)
Message-ID: <CAPEbg-HO3wXoO9QcYs_hi-7MhYxZPQsQxhE5gptJBgOzUrv2cA@mail.gmail.com>

I disagree with the sentiment that discussing vulnerable plugins is a bad
topic for this list (am I wrong?). I do want the info, and I would opt in
to Harry's list, but I don't see why I have to. This backlash from a few
people seems a little strong...

I think the point is when people signed up for this mailinglist they
didn't sign up for those notifications, which presumable entail
multiple emails per day (given 2 already today alone and security.dxw
seems to report 1 to 2 a day on average). While alot of people may
find the reports useful, they weren't the intended goal of this
mailinglist. That doesn't make them worthless, but rather means that
there should be a mailinglist where people can sign up for them only
if they want to receive them.

A separate list with more obvious way of joining would benefit regular
 users - they can just fill-out a form and get updates. And when they
do get
 updates, they will be specifically targeted at security.

 I'm pretty happy with the mailing list of Wordfence - they have a
huge user
 base with all kinds of different setups that they can monitor and
find
 exploits.

 PS: I'm not saying that your reports are worthless - the idea is a
very
 good one and I'm happy that you are donating some of your time
towards the
 community.

I agree. Make a seperate mailing list so those interested can optin.
Not force existing maillist subscribers to have to setup GMail filters
to delete these posts.

 I concur!

 I would certainly be open to joining that, and agree it should be
separate
 from wp-hackers.

Shouldn't the plugin be taken down from the repo? Maybe wordpress, just like it checks for updates, could display a warning in the admin.

This is exactly something I?m currently working on. In my case I will only show a warning when there is a new update.
Current target date for this is the end of next month.

The problem with announcing security issues on a public list is that people can use the hack. Specially when there isn?t any fix for it yet.
To me doing this is only for your own interest that you get possible clients out of it. This because it doesn?t help the community in any way.

I think it's more like 5-10 per month. DXW started posting these to the 
list about a month ago, and IIRC this is only the second time they've 
posted anything. So far they've batched them together when they have posted.

I'm all for keeping them on the list, because in my view it's relevant 
for two reasons: 1) Most people on this list administer sites that are 
potentially using these vulnerable plugins; 2) We all need to be 
regularly reminded that security is important and easy to get wrong.

FWIW, you can already get these via e-mail by using Blogtrottr.com to 
subscribe to DXW's RSS feed at https://security.dxw.com/advisories/feed/

That's assuming that the plugin author is going to fix the problem. If 
they're not -- which has been demonstrated by their lack of response 
when DXW privately disclosed the vulnerabilities to them two weeks ago 
-- then the responsible thing to do is to release it publicly so that 
users/admins are aware and can act to protect themselves. That is 
standard practice.

Failing to disclose a vulnerability that won't be fixed hurts users and 
helps hackers. Users are ignorant of it so they can't protect 
themselves, while hackers will eventually find it and start exploiting 
it. Failing to disclose it in the hopes that hackers won't find it on 
their own is just security-through-obscurity.

If you email security at wordpress.org they pull it straight away.

To clarify:

For PLUGIN security issues of plugins that are hosted on WPORG, you 
email plugins at wordpress.org

And we pull it as soon as we can review the PoC, verify it, contact the 
dev, and do everything else we do. Which may not be 'right away' 
(especially when someone sends in 50 reports in one day, yes that 
happened). Assuming we pull things same day is a lovely perfect-world. 
Ain't real though :)

I just did an "emergency" cleanup job for a company who got hacked. 80+ 
files had eval'd base64 encoded crud added to them, scattered throughout 
various spots in WP including deep in admin subfolders. Source of the 
intrusion appears to have been a plugin that was vulnerable to SQL 
injection.

Obviously lots of other security failings that let it get to that point, 
including not having recent updates. But it's hard to see where anyone 
wouldn't want to be made aware of potential vulnerabilities. I'm pretty 
sure this company -- who just paid rush rates to get it remediated -- 
would have appreciated them. Actually, I suppose I'd be the only one who 
wouldn't want vulnerabilities exposed -- that was a pretty sweet check 
for one day of work!

Amandeep,
It's our policy that proposals need to be complete by the deadline. You 
can add additional information by using the comment form on the 
application. Note that all our mentors will be looking for updates 
there; at this point we are past the point of discussing applications 
via this mailing list.

Most of all, I'd like it if people trimmed their emails to be less spammy.

I think what Harry is doing is a good thing, and I want to be aware of
security issues with wordpress.org plugins (as well as any others).

I'm happy for security reports, as per Harry's recent ones, to be posted
here.

Again, I think this should be added to wp core, and managed through the repo. When a plugin is removed from the repo, or better "deactivated" (not downloadable but with a big red warning saying why, just like they do for plugins older than 2 years), people get a notice in their admin telling them what happened. Only a few geeks (including myself) would check that other mailing list, leaving the majority of wp users unprotected. 

Should I file a request on trac?

That's a better way of doing things

I like that idea too.


For anyone interested, @exploitdb on twitter posts exploits in all
manner of software, including many web apps, including WP plugins.
(I have nothing to do with it, I just follow it).

I like the idea of a warning trough the wordpress.org repo.

It might be nice if there would be a button like "WP version x and 
plugin version y work/don't work" with a text like "Security issue 
found" and when it is clicked by one (or one authorized account), there 
should be a big warning. This warning should be displayed on the plugin 
page, but also appear in the WP backend of WP installs with that plugin 
activated/installed.

This is, I think, the right way to warn users about the unsafe plugins 
they are using.

Subject: [wp-hackers] hooking into admin_head-nav-menus.php or
	load-nav-menus.php
Message-ID: <1396065726514-43832.post@n5.nabble.com>

I am writing a little plugin that creates nav menu items based on an array. 
I have an issue where not all the links are clickable, and seem to be
registering three times for each menu item.  I am not real familiar with
either of these hooks, but it would be immensely helpful if someone could
comment on which hook is better to use. 

 I have seen buddypress making use of  /load-nav-menus.php/ but have seen
/admin_head-nav-menus.php/ as the proper way to insert menu items into the
meta box area. 

Here is a pastebin of the code. It is functional, but is still experiencing
the issues I described.  

http://pastebin.com/hSrsEMiK <http://pastebin.com/hSrsEMiK>  

Any help is greatly appreciated

Hello everyone,

Thanks all for the feedback. There isn't really a clear consensus here 
about what everyone would like to see. There is an clear desire for a 
mailing list, though, so I've set that up.

You can visit: 
http://lists.dxw.com/mailman/listinfo/dxw-wp-security_lists.dxw.com or 
send an email to dxw-wp-security-subscribe at lists.dxw.com.

 From now on, we will post all advisories to that list.

I will continue to post some advisories here, but only when I think 
they'll be of more general interest - for example, for a popular plugin, 
or a high-impact vulnerability.

Hope that's ok, and open to suggestions as always.

Harry
