Indeed. In 3.3 we fixed a lot of issues with the screen object not being
decorated with enough information, or worse, lying to you.

Assuming that $screen = get_current_screen():

Instead of checking $pagenow for 'post.php' or 'post-new.php', you can
check $screen->base (which will be 'post' for all post types, as it is the
base). You can check $screen->action, which will be 'add' for post-new.php.
Instead of checking $pagenow for 'edit.php', get_current_screen()->base
will return 'edit'.

The best way to determine what post type or taxonomy you are viewing is to
check $screen->post_type, $screen->taxonomy (instead of $typenow and
$taxnow, or checking $_GET, etc.). You can obviously combine these to check
both base and post_type and what not, to get a very clear picture of the
page you're trying to attach something to (for example). And of course
there is $screen->id which pulls together the base along with the post type
or taxonomy, depending on whether you are on edit.php, post(-new)?.php,
edit-tags.php, or elsewhere.

There's a lot of good stuff here. I would dig in.

Use get_role( 'administrator' ) rather than accessing the object directly.
If you want all roles, get_editable_roles() is a good start.

No, that's not right. grant => false works just fine for me.

$role = get_role( 'administrator' );
var_dump( $role->has_cap( 'read_hackers' ) ); // false
$role->add_cap( 'read_hackers', false );
var_dump( $role->has_cap( 'read_hackers' ) ); // false
$role->add_cap( 'read_hackers', true );
var_dump( $role->has_cap( 'read_hackers' ) ); // true

Please don't reach underneath the API to do things. This is how plugins
break. :-)

Anyone having issues with the WP android app?

I have a trunk version of WordPress/BuddyPress that gives errors when
I try to add it. Not sure if its my setup or the trunk versions or
BuddyPress.

Connection Error
org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException:expected: START_TAG
{null}methodResponse(position:START_TAG (empty) <br>@1:6 in
java.io.InputStreamReader at 406dd958)

Sry, not a public site I can send out links to.

Just trying to get around how it's supposed to work :) Btw: Using GLOBALS 
instead of global to _not_ modify any global.

The Q I was bringing up was simply: has_cap() doesn't check for $grant.

> Indeed. In 3.3 we fixed a lot of issues with the screen object not being
decorated with enough information, or worse, lying to you.

Sounds good. Thanks for that.

> Instead of checking $pagenow for 'post.php' or 'post-new.php', you can
check $screen->base (which will be 'post' for all post types, as it is the
base). You can check $screen->action, which will be 'add' for post-new.php.
Instead of checking $pagenow for 'edit.php', get_current_screen()->base
will return 'edit'

I simply don't get around why there's no argument in $current_screen that 
align with what was given in the $submenu or $menu global. Comparing those 
on a consistent base would allow to improve and simplify the admin_menu.

> The best way to determine what post type or taxonomy you are viewing is to
check $screen->post_type, $screen->taxonomy (instead of $typenow and
$taxnow, or checking $_GET, etc.). You can obviously combine these to check
both base and post_type and what not, to get a very clear picture of the
page you're trying to attach something to (for example). And of course
there is $screen->id which pulls together the base along with the post type
or taxonomy, depending on whether you are on edit.php, post(-new)?.php,
edit-tags.php, or elsewhere.

My point is that it's extremly hard to get around where you're really are. 
It's not like "if condition X is met: print title". It's more like "Compare 
combined $menu/submenu array with $current_screen match", as this allows to 
determine _any_ location/screen. And imho this should be easily achievable 
to give full control over your plugins/themes admin UI additions related to 
menus. I'm currently trying to write sort of an tutorial about it to 
explain where the shortcomings are.

Did comments.php find it's way into the admin_menu somehow? So far there's 
nothing about it in $menu/submenu and $current_screen is only filled with 
id/base, rest empty.

> There's a lot of good stuff here. I would dig in.

Sorry, but I guess I got this one wrong. What are you trying to tell me?

Jackie Sparks, that kind of language is not okay on this list.

Just in case anyone else steps into that trap: 'current_screen' is the 
wrong filter as neither 'parent_file', nor 'parent_base' are setup at this 
point. You should go with 'screen_options_show_screen'

I don't normally reply to messages here but read them all. This is one
of those message I am compelled to say something.

I am shocked and appalled by Jackie' last message. Being active in
community and in top ten group comes with responsibility.

Jackie's last message is offensive and I am sure many on this list are
offended by it.

I am shamed to be on this mailing list.

Jackie should retract the message with an apology to those offended.

Azizur Rahman

Subject: [wp-hackers] is it a good idea to remove the category base?
Message-ID: <CABybncjLd+HVka-qWtp0Gza6wLfkWwSuzs_wcj=LP6Fs05C85A@mail.gmail.com>

The codex has this to say about Category base and Tag base

<quote>
The?Category base?and?Tag base?are prefixes used in URLs for category
and tag archives, which look like this:

 example.net/wp/category_base/category_name
 example.net/wp/tag_base/tag_name

The default values for these are?category?and?tag. You can change
them, but you can't remove them from the URLs altogether.
</quote>

But we all know that there are plugins that let you overcome this
limitation allowing you to remove the category base, the question is
SHOULD WE?

For some reason, I sense that this kind of a modification would effect
the performance and may cause odd behavior.
Any comment-|insight appreciated ?

Depends on how said modification is implemented.  If implemented poorly, yes it can have performance implications. If not, it can be, for practical purposes, performance neutral.

Generally, no. Fact is that the actual URLs just don't matter quite as
much as people think they do.

Removing a base will cause a tradeoff. The tradeoff may be as simple
as some other type of URLs becoming inaccessible, or it can be a
performance tradeoff.

What the tradeoff actually is depends on the method by which the base
removal is implemented. But there will always be a tradeoff of some
sort.

WP_User::has_cap() checks for $grant, It does this by the following code:
		foreach ( (array) $caps as $cap ) {
			if ( empty( $capabilities[ $cap ] ) )
				return false;
		}

		return true;
If it's false, it'll return as empty.

WP_Role::has_cap() is the same, It checks $grant through this code:
		if ( !empty( $capabilities[$cap] ) )
			return $capabilities[$cap];
		else
			return false;
Ie. If the value within the cap is something non-empty, it's true, it
has the cap. If it's emtpy-ish value ( not set, boolean false, 0,
empty string, etc) it's false, it doesn't have the cap.

If you are running any kind of plugin that alters what users can/can't
do (such as the members plugin, role scoper, and a handful of others
i'd rather not remember the names of) then your code will likely not
work due to the plugin intercepting and going "Hey, I never authorized
that!"

Everything below is talking pure SEO, there are other factors to
consider.

From an SEO perspective all words within a URL have an SEO impact, but
not a massive amount, one non-SEO'd word isn't something to loose
sleep over.

Ideally a URL would be the main SERP a page is targeting and maybe a
few related keywords.

Having a base category and tag word can be a negative, but also a
positive depending on the site.

For a highly niche site where most posts are about one subject it
makes sense to change the category and tag base to a relevant keyword
or two. For example the site in my sig the category base is changed to
/seo/ since pretty much every page on the site is related to SEO.

If it's a site with diverse content you can use a hyphen (-) if you
don't want to use a plugin. Google considers a hyphen as a seperator
(a space) so is basically SEO neutral in this context.

For SEO reasons I tend to only use categories and not tags, they are
pretty much the same output wise so not much point using both. So have
never had a site where I have to worry about changing both the
category and tag base, on the rare site I use tags (never many of
them) I leave the tag base as tag. If you had to get rid of both you
could use an underscore (_) for the tag base.

Don't make these changes on indexed sites, you'll damage your SERPs.

Included this info in one of my WordPress SEO Tutorials
http://www.google-adsense-templates.co.uk/seo-tutorial-for-wordpress/seo-friendly-wordpress-permalinks

I've considered using a plugin to remove them, but that means your
category/tag URLs could clash with your static Page URLs or even Post
URLs if you use /%postname% for your permalinks setting. So on my
WordPress sites (got about 90) I've used a relevant keyword or hyphen
instead, also means there's no chance of performance issues removing
them.

Works for me, my sites recieve tens of thousands of search engine
visitors a day :-)

Subject: [wp-hackers] checked sub categories on the admin panel
Message-ID: <CABybnciqZFruO7BQEQsv-nJahnurhKssy3g6d_Hzr8+TfDLFdQ@mail.gmail.com>

On the admin panel, once a sub category is checked, it no longer
appears as a sub.
I see the reasoning why it is so. However, it's confusing to me. I
rather keep the original look.


So, before the current post is associated with any category, my
category box shows as follows

US
----california
----new york
--------manhattan

But if I check say manhattan and newyork for the current post, then
the category box appears as


new york
manhattan
US
-----california

Is there any way to keep the original indentation as is?

Message-ID: <CABybnci8X5d69OQcb7RL9dxuPfzo3+6qwL5PeE_f-Ku_qS5Dew@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to see/output the actual SQL query wp runs for
compiling the current page record(s)?

For learning purposes, I'd like to see what SQL query runs when we say

query_posts( 'cat=1&tag=apples+apples' );

or when I am serving a taxonomy page such as

mysite.com/fruits/apple

what's the SQL query WP is running? Can I hook into that section and
output the SQL statement on the screen?

2 step process:
1. Install the Debug Bar plugin
2. define WP_DEBUG and SAVEQUERIES in your wp-config.php file to true.

You can then check out the Queries tab of the Debug bar, and you'll
see all queries made, and by which functions. It won't link your exact
query_posts args to a SQL, but you should be able to work out which
one it is pretty quickly by the function backtraces.

If you're using a WP_Query instance for a loop, you should also be
able to dump out $query->request (I think that's the field) which is
hte SQL for that instance of WP_Query, alternatively, just dump the
entire object to screen, and you'll spot the SQL field.

What dd32 said, or here is a standalone file (maybe name it "test.php"?) which can run in your website's root to display the SQL query you ask for:


<?php

include 'wp-load.php';
$query = new WP_Query('cat=1&tag=apples+apples');
echo $query->request;

I'm sorry for not making my question clear, though I do appreciate all
answers as far as the SEO aspect is concerned.

I was more on the performance side.

After reading Otto's article (
http://ottopress.com/2010/category-in-permalinks-considered-harmful/,
), I thought removing the categories will have some impact. Please
answer this question for a site that has about 200 cats and 100 pages
or so.

When the cat base is missing, how would WP will interpret the order?
Is that a page? or a cat? Isn't more work to do? Or was it going to
check all the cats anyway so it would not matter anyway...

IN the ASP world, request.queryString, request.cookies, request.post
etc.... are the recommended way of getting the user input. but asp
allows me to go request("firstname"). by default, it would first look
into the query string, so it is safe and there is no performance trade
offf, if I was interested getting the first name from a qs. but if the
firstname was being submitted via form post, then asp would have
wasted some cycles going thru request.querystring collection before it
seeks the variable in the form collection.

Since I'm new to WP, is there a similat issue here? if cats are
omitted from the base, would it ever matter at all as far as permalink
resolutions?

That's very cool. Thank you..

Along the same learning lines, how about printing the list of every
single WP function that have run before it makes it to the template?
And perhaps display that list in the post itself?

Did somebody programmatically do that already?

Obviously, this would be on a test site where it is OK and quite
interesting to see all the actual run time list..

BTW, is there a way in PHP to tell the functions to output their name
programmatically?

something like

function xyx ()
{
  echo this.function.name;
}

There's a few php "dynamic" constants which refer directly to the
point in execution:
__FUNCTION__, __CLASS__, __FILE__, __LINE__

I don't believe it's possible to get all the functions that have been
executed in PHP, however, you can easily output the name of each
hook(action, filter) as it's fired in WordPress with this code
snippet:

add_action( 'all', function() { var_dump( current_filter() ); });

That'll execute on every WordPress hook, allowing you to see where
each hook is fired.. Can be very useful to work it out.

Is it theoretically possible to write a parser to run over all the
core files and parse each and every function that belongs to the core?

before parser

function get_queried_object_id() {
	global $wp_query;
	return $wp_query->get_queried_object_id();
}


after parser

function get_queried_object_id() {

      $list_of_functions_that_have_run_so_far =
$list_of_functions_that_have_run_so_far .   "get_queried_object_id()";
      or even better
      $list_of_functions_that_have_run_so_far =
$list_of_functions_that_have_run_so_far .   "> wp-includes > query.php
> get_queried_object_id()";


	global $wp_query;
	return $wp_query->get_queried_object_id();
}


would that work? or would there be some functions that would halt the
execution because of this change therefore,  this is a mute exercise?

You can use the plugin Debug Queries, list all queries with full sql
statement on all pages.

Otto was writing about a circumstance that is very specific to the rewrite rules architecture that is  WordPress' built-in method for URL routing.  However it is easy to "front end" the rewrite system using a simple hook and avoid the issues in the rewrite system that arise related to category archive URLs.

Ironically I just the other day wrote the following plugin for a friend to allow category archive URLs without a '/category' prefix. It is very lightweight though it could be optimized a bit more if it really mattered. As you can see it is quite simple:

https://gist.github.com/1421235

The plugin simply checks to see if the first URL path segment is a category slug; if it is then the plugin tells WordPress to load the category archive but if not it lets WordPress handle the URL routing. It works even if there is a page with the same URL; it basically "masks" that page's URL. 

I could update the plugin to give a warning when a page is created with the same name as a category or a category the same name as a page, but it was just a quick project as a favor for a friend, so it is what it is!  Perfection is 3x more effort than "good enough," or so said my college computer science professor. 

(Otto probably won't like this plugin. But then Otto never likes it when people modify URL routing,  though I've never quite figured out why that's one of his hot buttons... :)

I came from the ASP world, long ago.  What you are looking for to match the ASP funciton are the PHP superglobal variables, especially $_REQUEST, $_GET, $_POST and $_SERVER:

http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php

Hope this helps.

LOL, no problem, the question is generally asked for SEO reasons, at
least it is when I've seen the question asked.

Do you mean the performance issue with using a permalink setting:

/%postname%

If so that's fixed in WordPress 3.3 which is in RC1, guess 3.3 will be
released this month.

All,
  If I create a custom post type in a plugin and want to have the single.php type page be defined by the plugin how do I do that?

  Context:  One of the things I find annoying is keeping up with the support of my plugins.  I always find myself asking the same questions to users over and over and also have a hard time keeping track of things.  I know there are lots (and lots) of bug tracking systems but ideally I wouldn't want to send my users to yet another site to get support and would like to do it directly from my site.  
  
So?.I am creating a plugin that is a bug tracker specifically designed for plugin authors.  It will include taxonomies that help ask all of the normal questions that I usually have to ask for plugin support.  Anyways, I have a CPT for this and would like when a user clicks on a link I need to display custom information on the single post page.  My question is how I do this from a plugin.  It is simple for a theme but for a plugin it is different.  Is the bet way to go about it just to use a content filter?  

Here is a link just for a little visual of what I am talking about: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31511249/cpt-table.png
The plugin allows the user to choose the taxonomies that are shown on the front-end so that isn't all of them. 

----------------------------------------------

If you have made it this far maybe I could also get some feedback on the taxonomies I am using.  Here is a list of the common ones that I think will be useful but if anyone has any ideas on others or thinks the ones I have chosen are stupid please let me know.

Taxonomies about the bug
Plugin Name
Plugin Version
New Install or Upgrade
WordPress Version
A link to the site running the plugin and showing the bug
Operating System
Browser

Taxonomies about the fix
Milestone
Status
Priority
Assigned To

----------------------------------------------

If you think this is a terrible idea or someone has a better idea of how to handle this I'm open to suggestions. 

best,
ryan

OK, please disregard the question about the single page.  I can just filter the content for this custom post type as that is a much better solution.  If anyone wants to chime in on the taxonomy/usefulness issue though I am all umm eyeballs.

Guys, do not know what is happening but apparently WP is no longer
retrieving the value of global variable within the pages, I made the loop
like this:

if (have_posts ()) {
while (have_posts ()) {
the_post ();
}}

But anything that is within the IF appears on the page, the strange thing
is that I'm accessing a page, has no natural query_posts changing the loop,
it happened one hour to another, can anyone help me?

 My question is confirmed, I:

global $ query_string;
query_posts ($ query_string);

And it worked. Strange that I never needed to call the global WP trzer
should not have the default value?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adding "post_tags" functionality from backend to
 frontend of WordPress - to achieve "community tagging"
Message-ID: <CAF3MpAUeFO-bg9T8W3V1shca7r6Lq1zVkjypsO7fnBN4SHkVUw@mail.gmail.com>

I like the convenient tagging box and ability to pick between popular tags
on a post's edit page. But I find it too cumbersome to have to open an item
for editing just to add a simple tag. Adding a tag to a post currently
requires (once the user is logged in) one click to "edit page" + loading
time for the admin edit page, then write tag or click the "popular tags"
option and add tags, then "update post" and then ultimately, "view post" or
click to the link directly back to the blog, only then to spend time
finding the place where one took off. A lot of these clicks are not
necessary for the trivial action of adding a tag.

The functionality I'd like to achieve is to take the (otherwise brilliant)
"tagging box" from the post edit page in the WordPress backend, and add it
to the end of every post in the WordPress frontend. I'd also like to be
able to set parameters/options as to who gets to "tag" posts, i.e. control
to what users this tagging box is displayed. This way, I can make a group
of readers or admins collaboratively responsible for tagging articles on
the site, and they can - once logged in - tag an item immediately after
reading it, without going through to trouble to open WP's backend.

I've taken the time to review some of the plugins that currently offer
"community tagging" but they are not what I'm looking for - either they do
not work as advertised with current installments of WordPress, or are
unreliable. So I realize if someone is going to do this right, it might as
well be myself.

I know a little PHP and have not been afraid to dive into WordPress hacking
before, and I have had a few moments writing my own plugins and
manipulating the plugins of others to do what I want. But other than this,
I am very much a dabbler at WordPress development.

What I'd very much like from some of the more experienced minds on this
list (that means you!) is a word of advice on how to proceed with this
project. Where do I begin? Where do I find the code I need? Is the project
doomed from the outset - or does it in fact seem doable and possible? And
why - and how?

I'd like to the farthest extent possible not to reinvent the wheel if I
can. The functionality is there, and I like it just as it is. I'd just like
it in a different place.

Thank you very much in advance for your time and attention!

Yours Sincerely,
Morten Blaabjerg

Have you tried to click on the link title "Quick Edit" under the post title
on the All posts page ?

Yes, I know it. It's definitely a convenient back-end feature, but what I
really need is to move the tagging functionality to the front-end, so that
one can read and tag items in one workflow, instead of zapping between
reading in the frontend and editing stuff in the backend, which is still
too much hazzle to add "just a tag" to an item. Establishing a certain
speed and efficiency in the workflow is of the essence (to me, in this
project) - so that one may "read, think and tag" in one taking.

Best wishes,
Morten :-)

Most common problem for something like this: Something else screwing
around with the main query. Try calling wp_reset_query() before your
loop.

Look at the P2 theme. It has a tagging input text field on the front end.

There are several plugins available for front-end editing. The best
place to start would be to look at those and see if they allow
custom/different capabilities for front-end actions. One good example
is the Front End Editor plugin.

Subject: [wp-hackers] to display the data error term
Message-ID: <CAL1O-KVH0sOpxTBhtPyj-U4BG+fc6OSFL4mWQutpd0xUgejcWQ@mail.gmail.com>

I created a taxonomy 'team' and within the terms 'team 1', 'team 2' and
'team 3'. I want to list the data for each term on their respective pages,
so I created the file taxonomy-team.php and to list the data I was using
<php $ term->name // for example?> When access meusite.com /team/team-1
should appear on the "Team 1", but nothing appears. He print_r($term), and
nothing, but when I echo $term; appears the slug of the word, eg 'team-1'.
What am I doing wrong? Comom I list the data from the end when the user
accesses the page?

@Rafael
Thank you for taking your time to put this piece of code together. Can't
get it to work right out of the box, though. With a bit of work, I might
though. Can you tell me a bit more about what files to look for the
relevant code in?

@John
Thank you for that hint - the Front End Editor does indeed look promising,
although it works in a very different way from the "box". Would be nice
with the "suggested tags" but they are not life-saving necessary right now.
Seems I didn't look deep enough when looking for plugins to do what I
wanted to do.

Best Wishes,
Morten :-)

What about use Microsoft things http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff512419.aspx ?!

I think Microsoft is very inclined to support WordPress in some way, that could be a huge support.

Mike,
I tried the snippet as follows;

<?php

include 'wp-load.php';
$query = new WP_Query('cat=1&tag=apples+oranges');
echo $query->request;

and that printed out this;


//SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts WHERE 1=1 AND 0
= 1 AND wp_posts.post_type = 'post' AND (wp_posts.post_status =
'publish') GROUP BY wp_posts.ID ORDER BY wp_posts.post_date DESC LIMIT
0, 9

my two questions here are

//where is the word category in this SQL? it's like query_posts not
being tracked.
//and more interestingly what's 0=1 part doing in there. Wouldn't it
make sure that where part matches nothing?

?>

The 0=1 is there to select no posts, It's doing that because there are
no posts which match your query.
In the case of Taxonomies and sometimes post meta, multiple queries
will be made in order to build the query.
You'll have to add define('SAVEQUERIES', true); and dump out
$wpdb->queries to see all the queries made.

Frank, I got your plug in. For a moment, I thought I would  need a
German interpreter but that feeling faded away fast. Your plug in
works right out of the box. Very educational..

What's the call from list all about?

    Time: 0.00058102607727051
    Query: SELECT * FROM wp_users WHERE user_login = 'admin'
    Call from: require, require_once, require_once, require_once,
WP->init, wp_get_current_user, get_currentuserinfo,
wp_validate_auth_cookie, get_userdatabylogin, get_user_by

Its the description on wp.org Repo not enough for you for the plugin
Debug Queries?

For your example:
   Time: 0.00058102607727051
the period for this query in seconds

   Query: SELECT * FROM wp_users WHERE user_login = 'admin'
the SQL statement, an Select to all table fields in wp_users, if
user_login is exact admin

   Call from: require, require_once, require_once, require_once,
                  WP->init, wp_get_current_user, get_currentuserinfo,
                  wp_validate_auth_cookie, get_userdatabylogin, get_user_by
this are the functions, class or methods, there call this sql statement.

Ideas, Requirements for the plugin.
Current i rewrite also an tool for other content stuff on development
and debugging:
please see the dev-version of Debug Objects:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/debug-objects/download/

Best regards

The support forums is a better place for this kind of questions.

Message-ID: <002501ccb457$24f2d430$0100a8c0@corpfe1f3cd943>

I'm trying to send a plugin (light-captcha) and can?t do anything. (I quite don't understand all this svn):

Im doing this using Turtle SVN app:

  a.. Created a empty folder.
  b.. Right click and choose "SVN checkout"
  c.. Takes a lot of time and got a error: Server sent unexpected return value (400 Bad Request) in response to PROPFIND, request for '/!svn/bln/471682'
What is wrong?

Now Frank,

Does that mean that SQL statement has actually been called that many
times and from that many places in this particular instance?

Or does it mean that it could be possibly called from those places in the core?

Also on the "require_once", "require" particularly...
how do you find it helpful to include them in the list? seems clutter to me.
Thanks

It's a stack trace [1] for the function which made the SQL query.

"A stack trace allows to track the sequence of nested functions called
up to the point where the stack trace is generated."

Is the following method technically sound and OK as a practice on a
traffic heavy web site? Any more efficient ways you can recommend?

function filter_search($query) {
    if ($query->is_search) {
	$query->set('post_type', array('post',
'custom_type_1_here','custom_type_2_here'));
    };
    return $query;
};
add_filter('pre_get_posts', 'filter_search');

This will also make sure that the pages are excuded from the search
result which is obviously optional.

Hi IC IC,

I use the same function but with another filter, and it works fine for me
with all my proyects, some of them with heavy traffic (a spanish newspaper):

function searchAll( $query ) {if ( $query->is_search ) {$query->set(
'post_type', array( 'post', 'page', 'feed', 'custom_post_type1',
'custom_post_type2'));}return $query;}
add_filter( 'the_search_query', 'searchAll' );


If you want to exclude the pages of the search results, just delete 'page'
from the function ;)

Message-ID: <CAFcT6Xo5xqaOeDeQzKvB0NT=ovgEQTroO3NwqKXy8M2vt-A22Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

I'm just starting out developing plugins and such had a question. How would
you prioritize a function hook when the particular hook is used by multiple
plugins?  e.g.

Plugin One:

add_action ("pre_user_query", "plugin_one_pre_user_query");

Plugin Two:

add_action ("pre_user_query", "plugin_two_pre_user_query");



Thanks in advance!

As the Codex states 
(http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_action), add_action 
accepts a 3rd optional parameter, called $priority, which defaults to 
10.

Perhaps counter-intuitively, the lower you set your priority, the 
earlier the action will be triggered.

Do they need to be prioritized?  Best if not, but if you must then the 3rd parameter sets priority, with the default priority being 10.  So to get Plugin One to fire AFTER Plugin Two use any number larger than 10:

Plugin One:
add_action ("pre_user_query", "plugin_one_pre_user_query", 11);

Plugin Two:
add_action ("pre_user_query", "plugin_two_pre_user_query");

Of course plugins that must be loaded before others should be avoided whenever possible because multiple plugins might get the order wrong and it can be a mess, although sometimes setting priority can't be avoided.

Hope this helps.

That actually makes sense.
This means that in case to actions overlap, the higher priority is run
later, and will overwrite the lower priority action.

The if you are talking about how it suggests tags from a partial match 
with what you've typed, that's just add-on javascript with an ajax call 
back to the site.  Open up Firebug and watch what it does.  It would be 
easy for you to include that JS in your plugin/theme.  The official name 
of that feature is "Ajax Tag Search" and it is in 
admin-ajax_ajax-tag-search.diff

Sorry, I had the wrong file name in my paste buffer.  The call back 
routine is the ./wp-admin/admin-ajax.php file. To find the right section 
search for "case 'ajax-tag-search' :"

To look at how that is called from the JS code, search in 
./wp-admin/js/inline-edit-post.dev.js for "ajax-tag-search"

It seems like there are no performance issues with removing the
category base. This is from the responses I collected from you guys...

Comparing the two below, I myself don't see much of a performance
issue neither.

.com/category/%category%
vs
.com//%category%

so

.com/countries/USA
vs
.com/USA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above example, wordpress will look for a URL, that is /USA as a
category? If there was a match, then bingo.
It would not matter if you also had a page called /USA. That page
would never be accessible in this circumstance. So when you remove the
cat base, be careful with your page names!

I'm wondering how does wordpress match the current URL? What look up
does it do?

Is it something like

select current url from ?? where where url is a category?

And if we had the category base in there, would that SQL query be more
efficient?
Hard to tell.  It's still confusing to me...

What got me into this was Codex info on permaliks which states that
you can change the Category base and the Tag base, but you can't
remove them from the URLs altogether here!

My immediate reaction, there must be a wisdom behind it otherwise just
like they allow us to change them, they would have allowed us to
remove them as well.

Did they just not care about it and leave it upto a plug in to take
care of it? Is this conclusion final?

And if so, what plugin do you recommend that does this ( the removal ) right?

thanks

Subject: [wp-hackers] default theme being the crown or not
Message-ID: <CABybnciyP=MpTi60YDOJzpYNqs_TjMPg987bEsoq4A5+5OJvTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is it safe to assume that the default theme is the crown of all themes
and therefore, making it the parent theme makes the most sense?

Please answer this question from a point of view that the rule is you
have to build your theme from scratch! You are in need of selecting a
parent theme.

So what do you pick?  One of the freely available ones like the
thematic, hybrid etc... or no, go with the default theme and start
there...

The reason for this argument would be that the default theme is
updated all the time with every release and written/maintained by the
same core developers who worked on those updates first hand, therefore
it would be safe to assume that whatever they did for that version of
WP would be implemented the best way? And whenever you get a new
release, your parent theme is up to date.

Certainly not - at least, not necessarily. There is no universally correct
answer to this question. The correct answer depends on your needs and
circumstances.

Are you building a Theme from scratch, or are you creating a Child Theme of
an existing Theme?

Again, it depends on your circumstances, and what you need from a Parent
Theme.

And therein lies one problem with using the default Theme: the current
intent, as stated by the core devs, is to change the default Theme once per
year. Last year, the default Theme was Twenty Ten. This year, the default
is Twenty Eleven. Next year, the default Theme (at some point) will be
Twenty Twelve. Now that Twenty Eleven is the default, core-bundled Theme,
Twenty Ten probably isn't getting the same attention it did when it was
bundled with core. It is still maintained by the same team of developers
(note: not necessarily directly correlated to the same developers who work
on the rest of WordPress core), but is probably only seeing bugfixes. Next
year, Twenty Eleven will probably be in the same situation.

So, if you go that route, you'll need to be prepared to change your Parent
Theme once per year if you want to continue to take advantage of the
year-to-year improvements in the default Theme.

Message-ID: <CABybncj98voK+Cpk3+M1Q14JPWkR+WWLhugH7MBqCWmW3+R00g@mail.gmail.com>

To minimize the DB queries down to nothing on the home page of your
magazine styled web site, what do you say about the following idea?

Every time, you create a post or page (or cat or tag for that matter
), at the time committing that change into the database, have a plug
in run the home page  internally ( as if a visitor visited your home
page ) and grab the html generated and create a text file out of that
HTML ( from all the way up DOCTYPE down </html).  This way, your home
page ( be it home.php or front-page.php or whatever), may check if the
current user logged in and if not, just do a PHP include of that
recently generated file?

Does PHP provide a way to get a hold of that entire HTML? Would that
be a wp_footer hook?

Couldn't you just install wp-supercache or something like that? That
would be the best way of keeping the server and database load down.

That sounds like you want a Static cached page which only updates when
you add posts?
If so.. Pretty much every Caching plugin out there does this, Have a
look into Wp Super cache and Wp Total Cache for a start.

You can take it further and using those plugins, combined with a
.htaccess rule, have the web server serve the static cache file
directly - avoiding the PHP overhead all together

No. WordPress uses an array of regular expressions (typically about ~75 entries for a new site) to match the incoming URL against and when matched the associated pattern is applied.  Here is a dump of what the array looks like for a vanilla site:

https://gist.github.com/1445728

When it finds a match from the regex on the left side it uses the pattern on the right side to populate keys and values in the global $wp_query->query_vars, and that is primarily what WordPress uses to figure out what page to generate.

It has nothing to do with SQL efficiency, it has to do with making sure URLs are unambiguous.

You yourself explained the problem here:

If they allowed removal of categories in WordPress core then they'd have to deal with the UX issues that would arrive if something created a category and a page with the same slug.

> And if so, what plugin do you recommend that does this ( the removal ) right?

I wrote such a plugin for a friend the other day as an exercise to show her how to do it. It ignores the rewrite array and just checks to see if the first segment matches a category and if so changes $wp_query->query_vars so WordPress will load the category archive:

https://gist.github.com/1421235

Hope this helps.

-Mike

P.S. A pre-emptive comment: I believe some other plugins do use the rewrite array but IMO they are a lot more complicated then they need to be though that's only my opinion and I'm sure at least one person on this list, who I can name but I won't, will take issue with my approach.

We got one of those installed. I think the totla cache. And when it
was engaged, it was not showing the latest changes I made in the back
end. Of couese, I had logged in as admin maybe that's the reason?

To get those changes, ( for example to see the output of the latest
loop I created ), I had to add to the url stuff like q=32113213 to
avoid caching.

With the implementation I suggested however, I was seeking my own
programmatic solution where I can feel in control and manage the
caching business in however I want, in whatever chunks I want. But to
be able to do that, I need to get a hold of the "HTML so far"!

Maybe there is just no way to get a handle of what HTML that the PHP
functions have generated so far?

Would it be nice to have the option of doing something like this

$content = get_header()

Is this technically not possible?

Sounds like you had the caching turned up so high, that pages were
only expires every x minutes rather than on content update.
There are several settings you can set these caching plugins to, from
no caching, up to reddit/slashdot/digg-proof settings.

Yes and no. Yes, It's possible, but you'll have to use output
buffering to catch all output before it's sent to the browser, and
then retrieve/store/send to client the data.
Output buffering is what caching plugins have to use (as there's no other way).

For example:
ob_start();
get_header();
$html = ob_get_clean();

All the HTML output from the get_header call is now stored within
$html and NOT sent to the browser, you'd have to throw an extra echo
$html; in there for that.

In all honesty, The caching plugins out there are miles better than
anything you'll hack together in most cases, they've got time
(sometimes years) of development behind them, and they know what works
and the most efficient way to do it.
In other words: Don't re-invent the wheel when it's probably just
being used incorrectly

Also if your looking to get some more speed (this is outside this list
topic) you may want to look at what server software you are running
and maybe install something like xcache as well.

Also you can use Hyper Cache Extended
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyper-cache-extended/) wich
already have what you want and the controlls over all cache process
(for example: when to expire the cache - if post is expired to expire
only post post, or post and archive and home, ot all the cache for the
wp site). Also you can configure the maximum load for your machine -
it machine load is over X the new cache will not be created (the old
one will be used).

Message-ID: <CAGEuVU2uJv1wY75Q-bs6m=d9TN0XDSDcRvpnGw0SqfhcT1=zwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've managed every project so far with custom post types and
taxonomies. However, I'm starting on a large project where I wonder if
it might be better suited to using custom tables.

Rather than detail all my specs, I'm just wondering, does anyone have
any good rules of thumb for when custom tables become preferable to
CPTs?

I can give specs if necessary!

Thanks,

... Disclaimer - this is only my opinion based on personal experience and
is in no way a "rule" ...

The only time you should be using custom tables is when you need to index
particular data fields for your content and the indexing features of custom
meta fall short.  So if you wanted to build a geolocation database for a
high-traffic website where sorting/filtering/indexing on multiple fields
was vital to business (for example), you might consider using a custom
table or two to store data.

Just remember, there are tradeoffs to custom tables - CPTs come with all
the richness and goodness of the existing WordPress API (WP_Query,
taxonomies, etc).  Once you start delving in to custom tables, you'll be
spending more time reinventing the wheel than actually using the data.

So without detailed specs, my general guideline would be to only use custom
tables if the project *absolutely requires them*.  Most projects don't,
though most of us are convinced a custom table would be easier than a CPT
with copious meta fields.

Thanks Eric, makes sense. I don't have much of an idea of the scale of
the site yet, but it's the first one that has made me wonder if it
might end up benefiting from custom tables.

I think erring on the side of CPTs is probably a good idea, though,
and I'm not 100% I need custom tables, so I'll probably keep it
simple. I guess if the site is successful enough that CPTs queries
start impacting performance, there will be budget for porting to
custom tables :)

Cheers,

Steve

In one of my plugins I use a term slug as part of the ID for a link and I have run into an issue with Crylic characters.  It seems when Crylic is used the slug gets outputted in some encoded form.  

I am wondering if there is any reason that it wouldn't be safe to do:

------> $post_category_slug = urldecode($term->slug);

This fixes my issue with the Crylic characters.

Thanks.

I think this is what you are looking for:
https://github.com/brianlayman/WordPress-DirtyMC

It's called Dirty MC because it does the caching in the index.php file 
itself which is as clean as you can get it. If you are serving a cached 
page, WordPress isn't even touched. No DB interaction, no anything.  
It's also called Dirty because if you don't do things correctly in 
plugins, you could get surprising results. For example I found one 
plugin that allowed a partial page to be sent and before it triggered a 
redirect. As a result the partial page was cached, but the redirect 
never happened. So use with caution.

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to prevent sidebar widgets on Pages?
Message-ID: <4EE18CC9.7020807@helices.org>

I've inherited a custom WordPress theme (http://prismmpls.org) that uses 
the (left) sidebar for custom hierarchical menus.

I'm told that they planned a blog; but, they never implemented it. I 
have setup the blog and it works great! I want to use widgets in 
conjunction with ONLY the blog and blog posts.

I've hacked some PHP so that - in most cases - when their sidebar menus 
show, NO widgets show.

However, when a Page has NO sidebar menu, widgets show - I don't want this.

Also, on the blog Page, there is NO sidebar menu and the widgets show, 
but far down the Page. What's up with this?

In their sidebar.php, I added "!$children && " to their code:
|
<?php if ( !$children && !dynamic_sidebar( 'sidebar-widget-area' ) ) : ?>
|

Such as it is, that is what's working now.

What PHP code will prevent widgets in the sidebar for Pages?

How could I get sidebar widgets to show properly ONLY for the blog Page?

Where ought that code to go?

Please, advise.

Thank you.

Morning Steve (and Eric),
Playing Devil's Advocate a little, and like Eric this is based on personal experience only, I think that Custom Tables are fine if:1) You ensure that they are well architected2) You need them3) You need to write custom SQL calls anyway4) You need an n-to-n structure
There is a significant performance hit when attempting to create a correlation between CPTs (especially with defining or mandatory 1-to-1 meta data), and the limitations of WP_QUERY and query_posts especially in ordering / classification via metadata.
To give a real world example, for one of our sites recently, we had to move away from multiple CPTs due to the overhead of the inter-CPT dependancies. It was a sport site, where we had Matches, Teams and Players - which sounds simple, but the amount of mandatory metadata we needed to poll / sort / identify people on added quite a large overhead. The move to Custom tables with Custom Queries (oh how I love you ORDERBY X desc, Y asc and curse the query_posts 1-to-1 version) has really made a huge impact on the site and its editors. We've kept all the "news" stuff as CPTs, e.g. Match Reports, which now query a really slick class that returns specific data as needed.
Something we WordPress developers appear to be bad at on the whole (at least from the "larger" plugins I've seen) is actually planning how our data structure is going to look and work from start to finish. I can't recommend enough spending time architecting what data you want on the front-end and the back-end, and literally drawing on paper how you'll get it out.
Like most things with WordPress, where possible you should try and stay within the confines of the system; but it's your website - if the system isn't 100% working for you, change the bits you need.
Just my two cents.
Kev

You have current 2 XMLs as result, parse this via PHP and write an new
xml for this two sitemaps. For parse use the default of PHP5 or the
core of WP with SimplePie and to write the sitemap maybe use one of
this libraryies:http://code.google.com/p/sitemap-generators/wiki/SitemapGenerators
or https://github.com/MyHammerOpenSource/LargeXMLSitemap

Hi Mike,

You can reference them both from a single index sitemap. See
http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#index

So you could hand create the index sitemap, add references to your two
individuals ones, and they can continue to be updated automatically.

Submit the index sitemap to the search engines. (Though I should point out
that at least Google Webmaster Tools allows you to submit multiple sitemaps
anyway.)

Ryan,
Is your bug specific to pages, and not posts? There is an existing bug on
Trac for that, http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10249. The code there
may have better examples of what could be fixed.

As for your decoding it should be safe. I don't know where you're reusing
the value though: remember to still sanitize, and to re-encode if used in a
URL.

no, not this many functions, maybe - it is an stacktrace (an helper
for debugging) and only so it is possible to see, which functions are
in the process of this select. All reuires an in the stack.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adding class to oembedded media?
Message-ID: <CAEamYWTZE29Ou+6GF6XcyVrGp1KRDJ2tpqN--KrpA8d6XJqtxQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm wondering what the hook is that translates oEmbed URLs like YouTube
URLs into embedded media?

The thing is: I have first-line indents in my paras, which is fine in most
cases. But when media gets added to the page like a YouTube video, that too
gets wrapped in a para and of course gets the first line indent. The result
is a video that's out of alignment with the rest of the page.

The reason for wrapping content in paras is well-discussed, so I'm not
looking to change that. But what I would like to be able to do is at least
specify a class for the para so that I can style it. YouTube videos get
placed inside an iframe and are therefore not style-ready by themselves.

You're not playing devil's advocate, you're just reiterating my point :-)

Using custom tables over CPTs makes sense in the scenario you described.
 You're trying to filter/match/sort by multiple meta fields which, on a
high-traffic site, *will* impact performance.  It's one of the **very few**
situations where I would advocate custom tables.

In response to Eric and Steve, you can check out a plugin for WP that
helps you start out with custom tables if you don't want the overhead
of doing a huge ton of your own custom code.

http://podsframework.org/

Version 2.0 is coming out this month (beta) and even lets you create/
manage more WP objects like CPT, Taxonomies, Widgets, Shortcodes, etc..

Message-ID: <000301ccb8b7$144405f0$3ccc11d0$@fris.net>

Pre 3.3 im using add_filter( 'show_admin_bar', '__return_false' );

Anyway to do this in 3.3 to get rid of the admin bar, I noticed its removed
from the user profile options page.

Thanks.

You can use - add_filter( 'show_admin_bar', '__return_false' );

This is an option that works in my CMS functions plugin:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/point-and-stare-cms-functions/

BUT are you talking about front or back-end or both?

It's an integral part of the Header for the admin in 3.3, as such, all
methods to disable it have been, well, disabled.

You'll notice that the Links to the front end, and the account-links
(including logout) are now part of the Toolbar's menu's. Note, that I
called it the Toolbar, as that's what it is in the admin now.

For reference, here's some wpdevel posts related to it:

So did we build in an feature with an option to disable it, only to disable 
the disable option in the very next release?

Not as such, The Toolbar in the WordPress admin is now used for more
than what it was in 3.2, In 3.2 it duplicated things, in 3.3, as part
of the aim to simplify, the toolbar was chosen as the right place to
insert the header stuff, so thats where it now resides.

As a result, we've gotten rid of the small header, and moved to a more
consistent UI IMO.

There's the possibility for a plugin to completely disable it, and add
an alternative menu somewhere in the UI that holds the things you can
only find in the toolbar though..

That's part of the reason for the name change: there is no more Admin 
Bar, and this is a different feature. The post-update About WordPress 
screen has a blurb about it that will hopefully help explain it.


        Header + Admin Bar = Toolbar

To save space and increase efficiency, we've combined the admin bar and 
the old Dashboard header into one persistent toolbar. Hovering over the 
toolbar items will reveal submenus when available for quick access.


But yes, any time we change the UI there will always be people who need 
to have the new stuff explained to them verbally vs figuring it out by 
using it, through documentation, or via support forum contact. Since 
those often include the people who hire contractors/firms to do this for 
them, it tends to work itself out. Consider the extra billable hours our 
little xmas gift to your business. :)

I consider Jackie's post to be an innocent expression of enthusiasm, worthy
of no more than a "oops!  sorry guys (grin)" response - at most.

Please see: http://tinyurl.com/74qcuan (obfuscated link to urban
dictionary) where the first four thesaurus alternates of the term Jackie
used are "beast <http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beast>
great<http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=great>
greatest <http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=greatest>
best<http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=best>"


While it's appropriate to have policies that exclude street slang from
lists such as this, in order to reduce the chances of giving inadvertent
offense, I suggest that it's also appropriate to be slow to take offense,
given that we lack the ability to interpret intent through body language
and facial expression, consider that our different cultures and languages
limit our ability to understand the finer points of idiom and context.

Oh - and Jackie - congratulations!

Pauli

Urban Dictionary, seriously?  Why not try Merriam-Webster or some other
"real" dictionary.  While I find urban dictionary humorous, that's not the
appropriate reference for this word.

Sorry, the term is inappropriate. There are other "Urban" terms that can be
used to show exultation.  We shouldn't be slapping the hands of those
offended by someone else's inappropriate actions, regardless of how innocent
they thought it was.  I also don't think I needed to see the body language
along with the notes from those offended as it was pretty obvious how they
felt.  I do agree, though, that many times it is best to take a break before
responding but this wasn't one of those times.  This comment might have been
better applied to Jackie thinking before hitting send on her email, don't
you think?

I see you didn't use the "word" in your response.  Why is that?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Filter by letter
Message-ID: <CAL1O-KX4iyMyrm83fuHj+2p5CbU09_ahTxBKtVGXWsXujKmYEw@mail.gmail.com>

In a project must create a filter to list the posts from the first
letter of the title. I thought of creating a custom field and for
saving the post to retrieve the first letter of the title and
save this custom field, just in time to friltrar I could
use meta_key and meta_value, butwas wondering if there a better way to do
this .

Hello,

Is there someway to customize the page links within paginated posts?

When using <!--nextpage--> the page links are post-name/2, posta-name/3, how can I set to get links such post-name/page-2, posta-name/page-3 ?

One of many tonight (sorry folks),

For the life of me I can?t figure this one out, when I try to add or update meta-data where the value is ?0? (zero), it?s neither adds or updates it.
If I change the value to anything other than ?0? or ? ? it works fine.
We surely don?t think that ?0? is the same as no data, do we?

Any idea?s?

Thanks very much,

Message-ID: <BLU150-ds207E29E5B25F9BA331E6BCCBC0@phx.gbl>

I?m looking for a simple way to link to the next/previous published post, regardless of the CPT?

Specific Example:
===============
I have 2 custom post types, both of which appear in my main blog/list/query.
The list appears as: Post 1, Custom 1, Post 2, Custom 2, Post 3, Post 4, Custom 3, Post 5.

When I view a ?Post?, my next pervious links are always to another Post.
When I view a ?Custom?, my next pervious links are always to another ?Custom?.

Given that we designed and released CPT long before the CPF debacle, could I please ask what is the code (or codex article link) that shows how to link to the next/previous post from a given query?


Thanks,
Kev

I can't see any reason it wouldn't add it.

Are you checking the database directly for the result? Or are you
checking with get_metadata and then comparing to false?

Reason I ask is because 0 == false, but 0 does not === false.

Thanks Otto,

That's a good catch bro, I had to check:
-  get_metadata (and using a print_r to test) isn't returning anything
-  upon testing adding metadata with a meta_value of 0 doesn't get added to 
the database
-  upon testing updating an existing metadata with a meta_value of 0 removes 
that metadata from the database

I've been through the code and added all the various debug and die() scripts 
and the appropriate: add_post_meta and update_post_meta.

wait... Wouldn't you know, because I'm not embarrassed enough already, the 
code has a typo in it that I couldn't spot until now.

Sorry all, and thanks for the help.
Kev

Subject: [wp-hackers] plugins_url function
Message-ID: <87sjko3djw.fsf@newcastle.ac.uk>



I'm using the plugins_url function to insert links to my javascript for
my kcite plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/kcite/). In
general, all seemed to be working well till I tried to install it on my
own blog. In general, I have wordpress set up as you might expect

wordpress/wp-content/plugins/kcite

However, on my own blog I use a structure like so...


wordpress/wp-content/plugins/kcite symlink'd to

~/wordpress-plugins/kcite

This fails rather badly as this call

plugins_url( "kcite-citeproc/kcite.js",__FILE__  )

which should be interpreted as 

http://server/wp-content/plugins/kcite/kcite-citeproc/kcite.js

is actually interpreted as

http://server/wp-content/plugins/home/myusername/wordpress-plugins/kcite/kcite-citeproc/kcite.js

That is, the symlink is unwound. Obviously, this isn't ideal, if for no
other reason that it exposes myusername to the world. The correct URL

http://server/wp-content/plugins/kcite/kcite-citeproc/kcite.js

does actually resolve fine. 

Am I missing something? I can replace the whole thing with

plugins_url( "kcite/kcite-citeproc/kcite.js" )

which does seem to work, but will fail for some configurations. So, I'd
like a more ideal solution.

Yeah the problem is that PHP resolves symlinks, so __FILE__ points to
the symlink target instead of the link file. I've written a plugin
which I use for my installs to correct it on a plugin-by-plugin basis.
Check it out here:

http://lud.icro.us/wp-plugins/symlinked-plugins.phps

You'll need to enter the filenames of your symlinked plugins into the
switch statement. You could probably swap it out for a nice system
that uses WordPress filters if you wanted to improve it.

Okay, that's not ideal for me. In practice, I think it's easier to
unwind the symlinks -- or just turn them around, so that the real
directory is under wp-content/plugins then I symlink to this for ease. 

Glad it wasn't just me though:-)

Definitely a PHP issue, BTW.

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=46260

Sometimes people have been able to workaround this by using
$_SERVER["SCRIPT_FILENAME"] instead of __FILE__.

Yeah reversing the symlinks can work, depending on the situation. More
commonly though I'll have a plugin in one central location which I
want to symlink to multiple installs.

Out of interest, what do you mean by unwinding the symlink? If you
mean resolving the symlink, then unfortunately it can't be done in PHP
(see Otto's PHP bug link).

Re-reading your first email - If you're keeping all of your plugins in
a separate directory then you can just define the WP_PLUGINS_DIR and
WP_PLUGINS_URL constants so they point at your ~/wordpress-plugins
directory, and then you don't need to bother with symlinks at all. I
do this on my dev box where I have many WordPress installs and just
one directory that contains the plugins.

I did something like this recently, had an 0-9 a-z alphabet index on the top
of my site, and when you click on letter, it loads the post via ajax.

You wouldn't need custom fields for this, just wpdb queries.

Have a peek at the code.

I'd rather not write a workaround into my plugin which is specific for
my installation, though. It might not work when others install my
plugin. It's all a bit unfortunate. I agree with the bug report, though;
it does seem a problem with PHP. I don't think it's good behavior.

Yeah, I think that would be the most common use case. You could
hard-link, if you are within one filesystem.

I meant remove the symlink and stick the real directory there.

I don't do this. Basically, I have some plugins where I want to track
versions by svn installed through symlinks. It's pretty much there for
historical reasons, so easy enough to remove. I just wanted to be sure
that it's not a flaw in my plugin; it doesn't appear to be. It's just a
gotcha.

Is WP_PLUGIN_URL an accepted solution to point to the plugins directory? I
can't find any positive or negative comments on this nor documentation in
the codex.

I've been using the plugins_url() but here I encountered the constant too -
http://codex.wordpress.org/Determining_Plugin_and_Content_Directories (though
it is not recommended).

Using wordpress xmlrpc, is it possible to restore a post from the trash?
Also is it possible to empty the trash via xmlrpc?

Just FYI, there's a separate XMLRPC mailing list.

But since you're here already ... You can't place a post in the trash using
XMLRPC.  When a post is placed in the trash, it's given a post status of
"trash."  The XMLRPC post editing functions only support setting a post
status of the following:

   - 'draft'
   - 'pending'
   - 'private'
   - 'publish'

But this means you can set a post status as something other than "trash" if
you already know the post ID.  Just use the 'metaWeblog.editPost' method.

There is no function (at the moment) to empty the trash ...

1) Upload attachments.

3) Hover cursor over "Edit" link.
4) Look at browser status bar.
5) Remember/write down the ID.
6) Navigate back to post.
7) Enter IDs in the include="" argument.

I like to add an option to the media uploader: "Include in Rotator" or
"Include in Gallery" depending on the need (
http://www.billerickson.net/wordpress-add-custom-fields-media-gallery/ ).

Then, I either build the gallery/rotator into the theme or use the
'post_gallery' filter to rebuild the [gallery] shortcode.

	Danish
Message-ID: <CALb=2iy-0hYjT3JCLGvV9Q=1QTwCT7PCWFUEYfd=v4dKFTpZzQ@mail.gmail.com>

We have 3 special characters in Danish: ?, ? and ?.

When using get_tag the letters ? and ? sorts alphabetically, but ? is
placed before a in the alphabet (should be the last letter).

I'm using this code:
$tags = get_tags();
$html = '<div class="post_tags">';
foreach ($tags as $tag){
$tag_link = get_tag_link($tag->term_id);
 $html .= "<li><a href='{$tag_link}' title='{$tag->name} Tag'
class='{$tag->slug}'>";
 $html .= "{$tag->name}</a></li>";
}
$html .= '</div>';
echo $html;

from http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_tags

which works fine except for the alphabetical sorting of the letter ?.

I am using WordPress 3.3 da_DK

There's a trac for french accents:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15652

Anyone who can point me in the right direction for hacking this bug?

I hit this issue as well. The best solution I've found is to use some code
similar to what John B posted that filters plugins_url and targets the
specific predicable results of __FILE__ on the given system.

One optimization I'd add is to use the mu-plugins folder rather than normal
/plugins/. This way the plugin is always active on that site without having
any references to it in the database (so that when you copy the db to your
local dev site the plugin isn't missing). It also just makes sense to have
it there, as it's party of the 'hard' setup of the site rather than the
'soft' config.

My code is actually a lot simpler. Not sure if there's a case I'm not
accounting for, or if I'm just depending more on plugins_url() to take care
of SSL stuff for me, but feel free to contrast and compare with John B's
code:

You should never use them, instead always use the functions like
site_url(). The constants do not currently have any kind of is_ssl()
support so you are just asking for problems. The functions also work better
so why not use them?

Message-ID: <CABybnchkayJ1xnSg-3U2ZJXdoa0NJdW2Nhzd=j364J_qnS_YsQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
What is your take on the following two different scenarios?

You are on the admin dashboard and associating a post with a category,
in this example beverly hills.

And here the (+) indicates the check mark

scenario 1

...usa
......ca
..........los angeles
...........+..beverly hills
...uk
...china

vs scenario 2


+..usa
...+...ca
.......+...los angeles
...........+..beverly hills
...uk
...china

When associating your post with BH, you have the option of checking
either only BH  or going all the way up in the BH's hierarchy and
ending up checking us, ca, los angeles and BH.

Of course, there is the in between options such as checking US,
skipping CA, then checking LA and BH.

What are the back-end implications in between these options?
It looks like most themes, ( 2011 for one) treat it as if you checked
them all - even if you were to check only BH. That is when you browse
yje US category, you do see the post for BH. Sure;y it is convenient
for the user but what about performance?

Isn't it more taxing to SQL to pull all posts associated with not only
the current cat but all children down the road?
Isn't it performance wise, much faster to query "give me all posts
that are associated with the *this* category and not its children?

What's your take on that?

Of course this question would be not complete if I did not mention
that you are running a heavy traffic magazine/news styled web site and
not a simple blog.

Hey everyone,

Just joined this list and wanted to say hey :) I'm Liam, a web dev and
UX guy in the UK working for Storm Consultancy - we do a lot of our
projects in wordpress and will be releasing all our internal plugins
to the community after christmas.

I have a suggestion, too.. Is there any reason why, when wordpress
writes its rules to .htaccess, it doesn't also write the security
protection to deny all access to wp-config.php? Obviously, for the
most part this isn't needed, but this morning media temple had a
catastrophic configuration change which lead to the PHP handlers not
being registered, and all PHP files being downloaded as plain text on
one of their clusters.

If wordpress wrote a deny rule to .htaccess, this would negate that
event opening access to database passwords.

I'd suggest something along the lines below are added to the htaccess
file by the wordpress installer:

<files wp-config.php>
order allow,deny
deny from all
</files>

Thanks, and have a great upcoming holiday :)

It would be a good solution, if I didn't control the plugin or if I
really needed the symlink, I think.

I didn't know this -- actually, it's very useful for me, for an entirely

Hi Liam,

WordPress does not automatically set up .htaccess files (it can't: some
hosts don't allow them), but you can move your wp-config.php up one
directory level (towards root), so that it will be out of Apache's document
root. That will work on all sites regardless of whether they have .htaccess
files.

As to the media temple error: Ouch! There's a reason I haven't used shared
hosting for several years!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Force the user to crop images to a specific set of
	dimensions
Message-ID: <B1F05A7F-1962-4D42-80B9-6CF3D4C4EDEA@graymerica.com>

Does anyone know if I can force a user to crop a section out of images when they upload them.

Say I want to have a 180 x 50 pixel image as the featured image of a post.

Is there any way to require that the person uploading the image chooses an area that fits this ratio.

I know you can edit the image under the Media editor and that this exists as part of the header image uploader, but I would like this to be a requirement for a featured image,

I want to make sure the featured image will always be the correct dimension, but not have it autocropped with a custom image size.

thanks,

Andrew

What if you have your wordpress install in a folder called wordpress and 
the wp-config.php is in here, moving it up one directory would still be 
in Apache's document root, is it possible to move it up 2 directories 
and for it to still work ?

I prefer to have a tidy server and not have non wordpress files mixed in 
among wordpress files.

Why not as long as the user/apache has permission to access it. So I figure it would work with 644( xr-r-r ) permissions

I just thought it maybe too far back in the directory structure that 
wordpress would not look for the wp-config.php file 2 directories back 
and look only 1 directory back.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Hierarchical taxonomy post count
Message-ID: <CAEgmxaYvLg+P=3hMVx7XhSUmwwxt5+NEhuahGj8TfESCHdPi3A@mail.gmail.com>

I have 2 custom post types (e.g. product, brand), with a hierarchical
custom taxonomy (e.g. product type). I want to produce a drop down menu
(nested lists) of *available* products by product type for a particular
brand. The tricky bit that I can't see is how to do this nicely using
functions from the codex.

Here is a trivial example dataset:
Brands (2): Nike, Adidas
Products (2): "Nike's running shoes", "Nike's special shoe laces"
Product Types (6):
- footwear
 = shoes
   * running
- handwear
 = gloves
   * knitted

So under Adidas, I want to show nothing, under the Nike I want to show
 =>"footwear [2]"
 ==>"shoes [2]"
 ==>"Nike's special shoe laces"
 ===>"running [1]"
 ===>"Nike's running shoes"

So the ancestry implicitly accumulates the post count of the child terms.
The depth is unlikely to grow deeper than 4. Products have the brand as a
piece of meta.

Should I just start writing my own SQL or is there a nice way to do this
with WP_Query 'meta_query' + 'tax_query' ?

Well with file recursion exploits one can usually go as far back as the passwd and group file so as long as anyone can read it it can be a problem.

Then from the passwd file you can figure out what accounts are on the system...

Is it possible to get the next post id before update,save or publish.

Example, add new post, and you show the post id in a metabox without any
saving, updating, or publishing.

Curious if anyone has done this before?

Post IDs are generated when you hit new post, so you can add a meta box showing the current post ID without problem.

Hi,

does anyone know a WordPress-ready jQuery UI Theme? I'm co-developing a 
post-meta OS framework and searching for a theme that integrates with the 
admin UI. "Smoothness" looks kind of blurry and the port of "Aristo" 
doesn't really meat the color scheme. Maybe someone has a hint, or 
something that's already matching and ready-to-go and would like to share.

Thanks for any help!
Kaiser.

I may be incorrect with this, but I don't believe that is accurate - auto
saves before posting each receive an ID I beleve, not to mention another
user on the site at the same time.

Sorry if I'm off on that, but I don't think the post's ID is set until save

William is right. Since version 3.0 WordPress creates a post with
auto-draft status whenever you visit the new post screen. The ID of
the auto-draft is used when the post is saved, so it can be reliably
used (eg. in meta boxes) on the new post screen before the post is
even saved by the user.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Excerpted XML - how to get it full?
Message-ID: <000901ccbe06$f5233bf0$0100a8c0@corpfe1f3cd943>

I'm testing to export a xml from a old system, Im able to get a xml but it shows only an excerpt.

Is there someway to get a full xml instead?!

Test site: http://mag-kalil.rssblog.zip.net/ or http://mag-kalil.zip.net/index.xml it shows a "leia mais" (read more) instead the full content.

There are also a script for request the xml, maybe i can add something else here? This script are added to the "them" template, where are a lot more scripts and alike.

/* request XML */
 var http_request = false;

 function makeRequest(url) {
     http_request = false;

     if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {
  http_request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  if (http_request.overrideMimeType) {
      http_request.overrideMimeType('text/xml');
  }
     } else if (window.ActiveXObject) {
  try {
      http_request = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
  } catch (e) {
      try {
      http_request = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
      } catch (e) {}
  }
     }

     if (!http_request) {
  alert('Giving up :( Cannot create an XMLHTTP instance');
  return false;
     }

     http_request.onreadystatechange = alertContents;
     http_request.open('GET', url, true);
     http_request.send(null);
 }

 function alertContents() {
     if (http_request.readyState == 4) {
  if (http_request.status == 200) {
      mostraHistorico();
  }
     }
 }     
 //end Request

Like the media temple problem. With the PHP being plain text.
A wp-config.php in the accesasble folder you can just stick in a
include(../../path to file); anywhere on the system linking the the actual
file.

WP only looks one directory up which is annoying since it should do
$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] and go one up me thinks.

I like to install wp-sentinel on my blog installs then I use the following htaccess. Wp-sentinel will log and block recursive file access injections from url and the following will block people who are snooping, trying to see if you have +Indexes set in your htaccess.


# DO NOT SHOW DIRECTORY LISTING
# If you are getting 500 Errors when activating BPS then comment out Options -Indexes 
# by adding a # sign in front of it. If there is a typo anywhere in this file you will also see 500 errors.
Options -Indexes
#Rewrite anyone who is trying to snoop into the directories to be logged by wp-sentinel

RewriteBase /

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILE} !-f

Subject: [wp-hackers] Removing Admin Toolbar from Front-End
Message-ID: <4EF0C8FA.2020202@gmail.com>

In WP 3.3, everyone is saying you *can* remove the new admin toolbar 
from the frontend, but not from the backend.

Fair enough - I understand why this is, and the story behind it, and how 
it's different from 3.2.

But how do I actually remove the dam thing from the front end?

If a user has it set on in their profile, it hard codes a 28px CSS 
margin in the top of my site!

Can someone provide me the magic function that disables this on the 
front-end for everyone please?

[Not the "login to your account, and uncheck the box method" - can you 
imagine having to do that for every user!!]

Thanks loads in advance,
Robert

Put this in your THEME'S function.php (not in a plugin file).

add_filter('show_admin_bar', '__return_false');

You can remove it using this plugin - simple click and it's gone and stays gone:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using Sticky Posts in Custom Queries
Message-ID: <CAC3yCwouxASmsG5rG988aOuNgCNgvqgzUTdHNCzdPtGDwGFQ7A@mail.gmail.com>

This is my first post, so hello to everyone.

I'm extremely confused with Sticky Posts. No matter what I try I can't get
them to behave the way I'm under the impression that they are supposed to.
All the searching and googling that I've done seems to only return how to
ignore sticky posts or fetch only sticky posts.

I've setup a custom query on the homepage that pulls anything from the
category_name 'HomePage'. I'm using a new WP_QUERY class to do my loop. I'm
under the impression that sticky posts are supposed to show up on top by
default, but they are getting sorted by date like the rest of the posts.
The query runs on the home page, so I can't figure out why they aren't
showing up on top. Do I need to tell the query to sort on sticky somehow?

---------- my query --------------
    $paged = (get_query_var('paged')) ? get_query_var('paged') : 1;
    $args = array(
                'category_name' => 'HomePage',
                'paged' => $paged
    );
    $home_query = new WP_QUERY();
    $home_query->query($args);
--------------------------------------

The WordPress documentation gives examples on how to query only sticky and
how to query non-sticky. Am I supposed to do two queries? That doesn't
sound right. And it will be extra work to maintain the correct amount of
posts per page if I'm running 2 queries.

Any help is appreciated,
Matt

When you run the query_posts( 'posts_per_page=5' ); does it really
throw away the original query and re-run the same query - just to
compile the same recordset but this time with only 5 recs?

Would it be better exiting out THE LOOP at the 5th record?

Am I missing something here?

Subject: [wp-hackers] admin category drop down
Message-ID: <CABybncgZyoztescEsjvPcSjDJKKs7bbn3uPs1in+mO_9_sppjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a plug in that would break down the main category list from
its top levels and give each top level its own category box? ( making
it appear like each our custom taxonomies on the dashboard )

example

categories
<select name=category_dropdown>
<option>level 1</option>
   <option>level 1.1</option>
   <option>level 1.2</option>
<option>level 2</option>
   <option>level 2.1</option>
   <option>level 2.2</option>
</select>

becomes

level 1 categories
<select name=category_dropdown>
<option>level 1</option>
   <option>level 1.1</option>
   <option>level 1.2</option>
</select>

level 2 categories
<select name=category_dropdown>
<option>level 2</option>
   <option>level 2.1</option>
   <option>level 2.2</option>
</select>

This could help the selection of categories much easier when you deal
with 100's in box !

I don't think the form submit would send the data any differently - as
long as both select boxes are named the same way!

This looks possible to me with the use of filters. Is there another
way to do it?  And if filters the only way to go, which filter do I
use?

A custom query that is getting a category isn't a "home" query, it's a
"category archive" query. So the is_home won't be set for that query,
and sticky posts won't be automatically gotten.

Around our office we are starting to build a standard parent theme to start all our projects with.  

Does anyone know of a reliable way to create a private repository for this theme, that was included in the update notification..  I would prefer to use SVN as the source for the files.

I have seen this code for GIThub, but not for SVN.

The final goal would be to have something similar to the hosted Wordpress.org theme repository, but that only our sites could access and only includes our parent theme.

I would love to have update notification in the backend when a new version of one of our private themes is updated.

thanks,

Andrew

We've been using Mercurial on Bitbucket and we love it, it's like night and day compared to SVN in our experience. 

Private accounts on Bitbucket are free for 5 users.  I'd be happy to give you a screen-share walkthrough if you like.

Before I had time to get my CMS Functions plugin working well enough to add to the repository, I dabbled with a 'notification' file.

Simply put, this file would check against a version.txt file and alert the user, via the dashboard, of an upgrade.

I don't use it now but would be more than happy to email it to you.

Check out BeanStalk, it does private repo  ,git and svn, a bunch of 
collaboration stuff like notification and even automated deploy.
See what you think:

This might help as a starting point. Doesn't do SVN, but it does show
how to hook into the theme update system:

It is better to modify the query before it is run, rather than run a new
query, which is what your code above does.

You can modify the query before it is run by hooking into one of the many
hooks available.
Here is an example of modifying the number of posts displayed
http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Queries#Display_Order_and_Post_Count_Limit

There are other methods too.

Thanks for all the suggestions about alternative Source Control and using Beanstalk for SVN (we actually do that already)

I am more looking for a pull based solution, where the WP install itself uses the built in theme update mechanism to get the update.

This link:  http://w-shadow.com/blog/2011/06/02/automatic-updates-for-commercial-themes/ from otto looks like the best starting point.

If anyone has seen or has any code that can access a SVN server, that would be the best, but we might have to roll our own,

thanks,

I use the above successfully with a premium theme I develop (Stallion
SEO theme) with thousands of users with no problems reported so far,
had two updates since adding it to Stallion so a lot of websites
updated that way.

Hooks into the WordPress updates and looks/acts like a WordPress
repository update to your theme users.

Can take a little while for the updates to show up in your Dashboard
so don't jump to the conclusion it failed if it doesn't show an update
the moment you add the code.

I like to use the pre_get_posts hook for any modifications to the main
query.

Here's a quick article with examples:

Hi all,

Getting this error when using the Flash uploader. I've been a few fixes and
none of them have worked - is there a definite solution?

All the best,

Alex

If you implement something like this:
http://stackoverflow.com/a/842715/149060 - where the solution involves
using SVN Export Directory functionality to download the source to a local
folder, and then zip the directory, on the fly - you could then use the zip
file in the normal update process.

No experience with it - just interested enough in the problem to do some
Googling to see if I could figure it out.  YMMV, etc.

I wrote my own theme updater once. I made a class that extends off of the
Theme_Upgrader class, and another class that extends off the
Theme_Installer_Skin class. In the Theme_Upgrader class I overrided the
upgrade function and put my own modified version of it, but I didn't change
much.

Then you just need another function or two that you hook onto an admin hook
that will run a remote_post to your private repository (every hour or
something). Parse the request and pass it to your upgrader class in the
same style as the Theme_Upgrader normally uses and let WP do the rest of
the work.

Sorry if that was a little vague,
Matt

Andrew,
Here's some PHP that checks out from a remote SVN server and deploys the
code locally (it's clipped from another project, so please excuse any
non-existent values):
* https://gist.github.com/1512253

PHP's system() and chmod() make this easy. It took me far more time to
debug the svn & other system commands.

Message-ID: <23C10EEB-408D-478F-92E1-1EE38A45AF60@hearingvoices.com>

hey all,
when changes in core affect Docs in the Codex,
wondering if there's a way wp-hackers transmit that info to wp-docs.

an example, i helped write the recent page:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_the_Login_Form

in it we described the CSS styles in: /wp-admin/css/login.css

that file doesn't exist in 3.3. instead wp-login.php now links: /wp-admin/css/wp-admin.css.
i just updated the Docs page to reflect this.

but i found this change only by chance when i noticed a difference on a site's login page.

i had read thru the Codex Version 3.3 page and hadn't noticed it.
i'm sure it's in the list of closed Trac tickets somewhere,
but that's not a regular read for me (or likely even for the main Doc Team.)

so i was just wondering about the process, if any, Dev folk might communicate to Docs folk
any core changes that make existing Codex Docs out-of-date.

or maybe that's just too involved a task,
bg

Barrett,

There is a tag and a report http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/36 in trac for needing codex work. But it reality the codex is so large that that would be difficult to do. The change you mentioned happened some time (like 2 months) ago in trunk (the in-progress version).

Hello all,

Bit late but merry xmas and happy new year to you all.

I would like to know if there any way that I can have say 3 themes
installed on a wordpress blog and have a script that will change the
theme used depending on what time of the year it is or even down to
what day it is. Does anyone know how I can do that?

Thankyou :)

Instead of different themes, I would reccomend (since switching themes
is guaranteed to not requiring setting up options or be user action
free) enqueueing[1] different stylesheets based on the php function date[2].

2) http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

Hello Aaron,

Thankyou for pointing out that that I could just change the style
sheet with the date function and the wp enqueue style function.

If I really wanted to, could I do a if, else in every theme file and
have it say if date is between 8th of Dec and 7 of Jan include this
file else show other content? Would that work?

Thankyou :)

All those If statements seems a bit overkill to me.  I would
filter template and stylesheet.  Take a look at
http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/theme-switcher/trunk/theme-switcher.php

Unless you intend to show different content (not just a different
presentation), I would encourage you to make your changes via the
stylesheet.

Hello Aaron,

Thankyou for pointing out that that I could just change the style sheet with
the date function and the wp enqueue style function.

If I really wanted to, could I do a if, else in every theme file and have it
say if date is between 8th of Dec and 7 of Jan include this file else show
other content? Would that work?

Thankyou :)

Message-ID: <CANf48dRZu3Q0+tfWYBK6S5xFCowBGDgWnU=3-kY+VyiCysMd3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been looking for how it is used the function *esc_js* in the core
and now I have some doubts. In some places it's used the following html
entity code: &#8217; (right single quotation
mark<http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_symbols.asp>- ?)
and sometimes is used the normal apostrophe '. I know that *esc_js* will
escape the single quotation mark and convert the double quotation mark, but
I don't understand why in the core it's used this entity code.

Thanks!

P.S.: Sorry if this is not the best place to ask this

I think it can be even simpler than everything mentioned so far - add the
date class to the body_class function, and make your appropriate stylesheet
changes: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/body_class

It can even be simpler than that. Switching themes entirely based on
some set of conditions is easy.

add_filter('template','date_switch_theme');
function date_switch_theme($theme) {
	$month = date('n');
	if ($month >= 1 && $month <= 4) return 'themename-1';
	if ($month >= 5 && $month <= 8) return 'themename-2';
	if ($month >= 9 && $month <= 12) return 'themename-3';
	return $theme; // shouldn't happen
}

Obviously, you'll want to manually activate these themes and configure
them individually before using code like this to switch between them.

Let's say I have a 5 top level item category implementation and say one of
the tip levels and all it's children needs to use a 3 col layout. And they
happen to be 15 in number (there are 15 sub cats in total that need to use
that particular 3 col layout )

Why isn't there a category layout dropdown like the pages interface do
whereby you can select the layout template you want to use when creating a
category? What is the wisdom
behind  treating pages differenly in this regard and leaving the cats
layout handling to be done at code level?

Personally I would love this feature. If you write a patch to make it 
work and put it on a trac ticket, I'll add my +1.

Sounds like a more general templating system than just "page" templates, i.e. there could be multiple templates for each taxonomy, each post type, etc.

I do look forward to the discussion for this on trac.

Not to start a raging debate, but this would be a good use case for term 
meta - would it not?

I think this would be an excellent feature.

Jane, I'm not a PHP developer. I'm too new to PHP. My background is on
ASP. So I can't do a patch. But I just created trac ticket and
submitted at http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic/category-templates-with-cascading-power?replies=1#post-20956

Any follow up discussions to this should take place over there!

Hi all,

Can anyone confirm that a plugin's registered activation hook is always
fired during the auto upgrade process?

Thanks!

Without official term meta, this becomes very difficult to pull off
efficiently.

It certainly is. At this point, for not being able to implement
something like this and many other cool things that can grow along
with it shows as a "limitation" on the WP part. But WP has always been
able to get over such limitations so far. I hope this one too is a
matter of time...

What's a good URL or thread that I can look into about the "term meta"
table discussions. It seems many people wished/proposed/and been
waiting for that table. Is it in the works? Or is it not gonna happen
due to some reasons? If there are reasons, I'd like to know more about
it.

To summarize the history. 

Against:
Terms are descriptors and don't need to have their own content.

Technically:
There is not a technical reason on either side. It basically boils down to back in 2.3 when we added tags and moved Categories from their own table to the Terms table, hundreds of plugins were broken since they used to call the data base directly. And then 2.5 was only slightly better.

Since then the database schematic does not get touched unless absolutely needed. Form there it has been argued for a term meta table, adding rows to wp_terms_taxonomy, or move to a shared meta table for all meta types.

No, it doesn't run during upgrade. Just found the answer, doh!
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_activation_hook

So, what is best practice for a plugin handling, say, a WP version check
when upgrading? Can I rely on the plugin upgrade error checking to catch a
PHP fatal error, and subsequently deactivate the plugin?

Thanks for any suggestions.

The plugin upgrader will NOT catch a fatal error reliably. If it's a
singular plugin upgrade, it'll be caught, but if it's part of a bulk
upgrade, it won't be caught unfortunately.

The best way to handle any upgrade function you need is to store a
"Database version", for example:

add_action('admin_init', function() {
if ( get_option('plugin_db_version') != 3 ) {
  if ( get_option('plugin_db_version') < 2 ) {
    upgrade_to_two();
  }
  if ( get_option('plugin_db_version') < 3 ) {
    upgrade_to_three();
  }
  update_option('plugin_db_version', 3);
}
});

Hopefully your plugin isn't written in a way that it'll fatal if the
options haven't been updated..
Also, never perform the above checks on a non-admin page (which is why
i've used the admin_init hook), doing so will lead to concurrency
issues and much more likely that the upgrade routines will fire
multiple times.

Thanks, Dion.

Actually, the method you describe is exactly how I do it now, hooked to
admin_init. So, I won't change my methodology. :-)

No, in my case an option change wouldn't cause a fatal error, but I'm
thinking more about an undefined function fatal error, eg installing the
plugin on a lower WP version than required.

GD isn't a requirement, but this is the same way we handle it elsewhere.
 And, coming from having accidentally installed PHP at least once *without* GD,
I can tell you that having notices like this in there is a lifesaver.  It
took me about 2 weeks to figure out why thumbnails weren't being
auto-generated.

I mirrored my patch after the other patterns we follow when using
{{{getimagesize()}}} in core for consistency.  If one of the core leads
wants to step in with an opinion, I'd be fine going either way, really.

I might be alone in this but I actually don't like the new welcome screen.
Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful pice of work but it's impractical.

My reason for this admission is that I develop corporate sites using WordPress as a CMS.
My clients prefer a clean, uncluttered look and feel (which is one reason why I developed this plugin - http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/point-and-stare-cms-functions/) and want to just get straight into using their new system.

As useful as the welcome screen is to those that have just installed WP for the first time, for example, as a developer I always have to remove it.

On the opposite I simply love full screen editor for the same reasons of being able to work zen-like.

Might just be me though.

The WordPress UI (of which the welcome is part) is largely designed for 
the people who use it, not for the people other people hire to do setups 
for them. Consultants who are doing setup for other people obviously 
don't need (or in most cases want) the welcome box, but they are capable 
of just turning it off. For that matter, users can also click dismiss 
the one time without a great deal of hardship.

Totally agree.

I can only presume that there are many, many times more 1st timers/ non (professional) developers that use WordPress than us lot.

As I said, it's a beautiful piece of work, just not something I, or my clients, need.

The extra 30 seconds it takes to log in as the client and dismiss it is nothing (or chargeable to the client depending on how you look at it!) and I am merely making a statement rather than a complaint.

The other 99.9% of 3.3 I absolutely adore, of course!
