Greetings all,

I have noticed that in profiling Wordpress, wp_get_nav_menu_items() seems
to be a slow function overall in any given page load. Looking through
tickets, it seems others would agree...

It *needs caching*:
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27120

Saving menus apparently can be slow and we shouldn't "call
wp_get_nav_menu_items() in wp_update_nav_menu_item() unless we need to.
(Huge.)"
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22189

I was wondering if there is any recommendation for optimizing the navs or
if there's anything in-the-works that would improve performance without,
say, adding a site cache plugin?

Best regards,
Luke

Hi,

Maybe use a transient to cache the menu items ?

This is a good place to use fragment caching. Since menus don't change very often, just cache the entire rendered menu in  a transient. I think there are plugins that do this out there. See for example https://github.com/Rarst/fragment-cache <https://github.com/Rarst/fragment-cache>
