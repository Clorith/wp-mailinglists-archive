Dear Wordpress community,

I am Ching Tien Shi, a computer engineering undergraduate from
University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. I have confidence in my PHP, C
and Java skills and I thought to contribute to an open source project
to make use of my skills. I chose Wordpress and some of my friends
too are interested in contributing to Wordpress project.

Can you guide us to get started with the project?

Best Regards,

Hello Ching,

Great to hear you and your friends are interested in contributing. I would
suggest taking a look at https://make.wordpress.org/ to see how you can
contribute and joining the WordPress Slack
<https://make.wordpress.org/chat/> to get to know the community.

Regards,

Koen

PS: You better get used to writing WordPress instead of Wordpress ;-)

Hi Tien,

I did a workshop in a WordCamp Pune, I have attached it here, it's not
extensive (as it was a presentation of a workshop) but gives you an idea of
things to do to get started.
