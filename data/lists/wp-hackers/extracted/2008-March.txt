DD32,
I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to with plugins. Are you saying
that including an HTML caching solution directly into WordPress is a good
idea as plugins are no longer guessing if WP-cache is installed, or are you
saying something else?

Sorry for the confusion - I'll rephrase, but wont be saying exactly the same things.. simply due to my confusion :)

What i meant, Was that While a HTML cacher would be nice in the core, it is a bit of a hard compromise in terms of configuration.

The HTML cachers currently hook in before the database has been connected to, and as such, only the options set in the config file are available. So it'd either be allways enabled, or allways disabled at that point, There wouldnt be much user configuration available via the admin interface for the caching as a result. (writing to the filesystem is allways problematic for saving options).

The Object Cache was removed due to the problems with maintaining it, problems such as filesystem access(permissions, and/or speed); A HTML cache would have the exact same problems.

While the HTML caching could take place after the database has been connected to, to allow for generalistic options to be set, it would remove a main benefit of having the caching installed in the first place - That is, That quite often the problem is that MySQL goes down under heavy load.

Thanks for the clarification. That's an angle I certainly didn't think of,
so it would be something that I would need to investigate before undertaking
a caching system.

Greets -

I've used clients for posting to LiveJournal. I liked a couple of them 
... for a while ... but it always seemed like over-kill. Maybe if they'd 
been designed better ... or maybe it was just more than I needed.

More often I've used the blogspot.com bookmarklet as a sort of 
clip-board, select text, click the b'marklet, copy the html from the 
window (selected text along with document title formated as a link), do 
it again and again and in no time 4 or 5 blocks of text c/w fully 
described URLs.

How about a minimalist bookmarklet? Just the post form with a subset of 
features. (When working wordpress.com maybe a menu to allow selecting 
which blog to post to.)

apologies if this wasn't meant as a wish-list thread

Take a look at the Zend_Cache in the Zend_Framework

Define very few.


This is a matter of perspective. You might not have been exposed to  
anything but shared systems, but many users over the years out grow  
shared hosting and move to more dedicated solutions. I have. And I  
would argue that there are probably plenty of users that self-host  
wordpress on boxes that they have root on --- which is at least gives  
them a shot at APC... memcached probably is a different beast, but  
supporting multiple back-ends would be kind of trivial. File based  
caches have limits. And while they are great when you need them...  
they only scale to a certain point.

But the real heart of the matter is this: just because half of the  
users can only take advantage of one kind of cache back-end, doesn't  
mean we have to 'punish' other users that can take advantage of more  
sophisticated solutions.

On monday, I'll take a closer look at what it might actually take to  
implement other backends, but given that APC and memcached have  
pretty well documented APIs, I feel that supporting them would be  
easier than we might think.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Shared Users Table
Message-ID: <F2EAF807-655C-451A-98AD-30962E94D9E0@xentek.net>

I have a new blog network that is preparing to launch, and since the  
number of blogs is relatively low, I decided to go with the shared  
users table approach as opposed to using WP-MU.

My Question is this... what's the best way to get users who register  
to have a default role of 'subscriber' across all blogs. If they  
register on one, they are in the table, seen by the other blogs, but  
have a 'no role on this blog' permission. I'd like them to be set as  
subscriber automatically.

Any help on formulating an approach to this would be great. Any  
solution I come up with will be shared freely with the WP community....

Alternatively, if I can get some idea on how the permissions are  
stored in the usermeta table (particularly the capabilities key) I  
can probably come up with a solution on my own. Again, any insight  
you can give me will be helpful.

I anxiously await your response.

Thanks!

I'm hesitant to give intelligence to another blog network. ;-)
That said, what's good for the WP community is good for us too. We have a
different approach than you, as well as WordPRess.com. WP.com takes the MU
approach. You take the CUSTOM_USER_TABLE approach where we have hundreds of
single WP installs - actually I see this being a problem at some point but
it is what it is.

Without any real experience with using CUSTOM_USER_TABLE, I'd say make sure
you are sharing CUSTOM_USER_META_TABLE as well - that's where your
capabilities/roles are stored.

I would suggest that within the time frame (and I might want to take 
this in account for my Controller proposal, if it accepted) of three 
months, the probability of you creating a working, complete caching 
system that implements not only an API for other backends, but also an 
API for plugins, as well as providing a solution for different solutions 
would seem optimist.

As someone who has used Zend_Cache, I would think that taking what 
WP_Super_Cache and refactoring it and what is currently in the core or 
another (better) game plan would probably be the best route. If what you 
are actually saying is that you would like to create a new caching 
system from the ground up. I will, in your best interest in mind, advise 
you against this course of action. It is completely possible to continue 
the project after GSOC is over, it is really up to you.

If it was me, I would just as rather create something that can be used 
and be complete within the time frame of the GSOC project. Any project I 
will do, would be finished during that time frame or very close to it. 
I'll say, this proposal has picked up a lot more interest than mine did, 
so you have something here that most likely will have a lot of feedback 
during your project (well, initially at least, interest may fade over time).

I think you might have misunderstood the meaning of my statement. I do 
not think complex tasks, projects, or solutions aren't worth doing, I do 
think they are worthy. As a developer, it is one of the highlights of 
programming and development. What is the point of doing something, if 
you gain nothing from it? The purpose of development for me is to learn 
and grow as a developer. It is what has kept me in the WordPress 
community for longer than any other project I've worked on in the past.

It was a compliment and I concede that I don't know enough to even 
imagine creating a working solution. The experience I do have, tells me 
that you have a long and difficult road ahead of you. That is dependent 
completely on which road you take. My solutions usually involve immense 
pain (self-)inflicted upon myself by taking the most difficult path 
imaginable, so I'm biased in my estimations.

I'm under the impression that you want to do this for the GSOC. Am I 
wrong in assuming that to be the case or are you just proposing that a 
student can work on this for the GSOC?

I want to respond more fully to your reply Jacob, but I just thought I'd
mention this before I go to bed. This is by no means my actual project
submission. I'm testing the waters, seeing what the WordPress community
would like, what other developers feel is feasible, and so on.
While I'd love to see a caching solution in WordPress, it might not be the
right time. There may be too many technical hurdles, and the WordPress
community may want a different caching solution then I would be able to
provide.

For this to work all the blogs need to be wp 2.3.2 or earlier. for 2.5 you
will need the secret key the same on all of them and all blogs would need to
be update simultaniusly or passwords will be messed up after the first user
uses a 2.5 site, then tries to enter a 2.3 site.

I've done a lot of work on the caching systems that WordPress.com
uses, severely hacking on Ryan's memcached client, and I wrote the
HTML cache that helps burst-traffic event blogs like live.gizmodo.com
stay up when most others fail.

I don't know of anything better than Donncha's Super Cache for what it
does. My HTML cache (I named it supercache before Donncha released his
Super Cache, but I never released mine so he won the name recognition
in the end) is based on memcached and that makes it a poor fit for the
mainstream right now. That's not because memcached is hard to set up
(it's not) or hard to code for (we have working clients) but shared
hosting setups typically don't allow it.

Some form of worthwhile persistent caching should work in the default
install with the minimum requirements. Obviously we aren't there yet.
If we keep the requirements as they are, we will have to put the cache
in the database. Caching in the database would only be worthwhile if
we cached very high-level objects, the highest level being fully
rendered pages. Obviously this would not be as good as an APC object
cache, but for the minimum install it could do wonders.

What I learned from my experiences with WordPress and caching is that
there are more variables than you can hope to account for. (You can
take the WordPress out of the dynamic but you can't take the dynamic
out of WordPress?) You can get a lot of mileage from caching at any
level (queries, values, objects, rendered HTML elements, entire pages)
but the higher up that stack you go, the harder it gets because there
are so many factors contributing to the rendered page.

Back to my supercache: it's painfully simple and extremely effective
at serving a page to new visitors. It allows pages to be freshly
rendered for cookie holders or whatever criteria you care to configure
for identifying visitors who require it. The whole thing is about 200
lines of PHP including comments. Using a similar test for cache
eligibility, a db-backed HTML cache could extend the operational
availability of sites that experience surges of new visitors to single
posts (a typical Digg scenario). This would have to be significantly
more complex than my supercache because we would have to code even the
basic mechanism of expiration and cleanup into the cache. However, if
we are only caching entire pages, this can be pretty easy.

One thing that kills an HTML cache is too-dynamic content. Random
output (e.g. random-ordered blogroll), time-dependent elements (e.g.
clocks), and HTTP header-dependent elements (e.g. seach term
highlighting [Referer] or Firefox buttons [User-Agent]) all become
frozen in the cache and should not be used on blogs that serve
pre-generated pages unless they are generated client-side with JS,
Flash, etc., or the cache is set up to vary accordingly.

Wrapping up, I think there should always be attention devoted to
improving WordPress resilience on the minimum setup and I would like
to see this as a GSoC project.

Cheers,
Andy

Two things that might help you out:

Run any number of individual WP blogs off a single install  
(individual admin sections for each):
<http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/features/virtual-multiblog/>

This plugin (_very_ beta) might get you started with getting shared  
user tables working:
<http://www.lyonesse.info/WPP/>

(And if you _do_ get shared user tables working, I would love to see  
what you come up with!)

Good luck,
Stephen

Slightly off-topic, but the WP-Cache thread inspired a blog post that  
people might find useful:

Override single WordPress pages with .htaccess
<http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/2008/03/override-single- 
wordpress-pages-with-htaccess/>

Useful for (among other things) manually caching a particular page  
that is getting hammered for whatever reason.

All the blogs are new and up to date. I'm using the CUSTOM_USER_TABLE  
&& CUSTOM_USER_META_TABLE constants to point to the right tables. So  
that much is working. However when users register to comment... I  
have to manually give them subscriber role on all the other blogs.  
Its this last part I'd like to 'fix'. Giving everyone subscriber role  
on all blogs.... and do it in a way that doesn't keep me from  
upgrading wordpress when updates arrive.

my situation.

Try doing something like this in a plugin enabled on all blogs:

if(is_user_logged_in())
if(!current_user_can('read'))
    $user->set_role('subscriber');

Only need to hook this to admin_menu, so that it only runs in the backend.

Yes, both the users and usersmeta table are shared. Looking at it,  
I'm seeing the various site keys (table prefix) in there with  
capabilities and roles.

However, I'm not sure what is stored there. Looks like a serialized  
object... am I correct? And if that *is* what it is, then I'm  
thinking that I could create something that fires update_usermeta ...  
but since I don't know what I should be storing in the capabilities  
record - which object to create, populate serialize and store -- I'm  
kind of at a loss on how to move forward.

Perhaps I just need to set up an xdebug environment at home (we use  
it at work extensively) and just step thru this process and see what  
I can gleam from it.

hmmm,

Incidentally I think it's the first time I notice a WP feature I didnt
know about
The link you pasted got cut after 'single-', but it stills ends up on
the right page. Didnt know about this:)

Oh yeah... I use this all the time.  This is my custom permalink recipe:

/%category%/%post_id%/%postname%/

You can leave off the postname part and still get to the article. The  
slug is not needed for look up because the id is in the url.

... and has a huge hidden benefit (or at least had for me) when  
porting a site from another CMS to WP and trying to keep all the old  
links working.

That one feature in 2.3 enabled me to use one-liners in the .htaccess  
rather than have a 16,000 line .htaccess file. Props to Mark Jaquith  
for his work on that.

Just curious, how could/would this be configured AFTER an installation? 
I heard that it could be configured DURING an installation (If this is 
correct right?), but what-if someone already has all their blogs setup, 
running SVN, and already had TRUNK (2.5) there?

Or am I missing this all together? Can someone explain this 
feature/function(s) in short, but easily understandable detail? =) I 
read through the comments on the ticket, but it's still a little bit 
confusing. http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5586

That's quite the inspiring story, thx for sharing! Is there a spot on  
wordpress.org where we keep such stories for marketing use?

I'll say, that since I haven't been able to get it to work and don't 
have enough time to pinpoint where the problem is that you should 
probably try it and give feedback on what is occurring. It is 
fascinating, but I feel that others won't be able to get it to work 
either. Once I get enough time, I think I'll rather work with DD32 on 
adding support for Subversion. I think also test cases could also be 
written and if I had time, I would do that also.

Overall, you'll have to wait until the man, the master, the creator of 
the system or Ryan to give more information. At the moment, I'm happy 
such a system exists, but I'd be happier if it actually worked or 
supported SVN. Both of them are fixing issues, so I'm crossing my 
fingers that the issue that I'm having will fall into one of the fixes.

As to answer your question for configuration, you don't do it after, you 
enter the information and it takes it and tries to download and copy the 
files. It doesn't save the information because of security (might be 
wrong). It only supports FTP technology, which shouldn't pose any 
problem to those who use Subversion (my problem is most likely 
permissions and/or extension, etc).

As for configuring before an installation, that doesn't sound like 
something that makes sense when upgrading plugins, you should have 
plugins already at the latest when you have a new installation. Also, 
the involvement is done in the plugin page anyway, so if it exists, I 
doubt it is of very much use. However, I do know there are a few 
constants which might allow you to define them within either a plugin or 
in wp-config.php. However, the ones that I've seen do not involve very 
much configuration, depending on what you are trying to do.

How it works:

It works when the plugin page finds that your plugin is out of date, it 
will provide a link to let you download the plugin automatically.

Once you click this link, you provide FTP information to your server.

It will then retrieve the plugin download, upload it to your server and 
replace it with the old plugin.

In theory, it should work. I'm a little biased because I can't get it to 
work.

I've worked extensively with WordPress caching projects (both HTML and
object caches, having rewritten WP-Cache for IIS, helped Donncha with
a bunch of WP-SuperCache stuff, and written caching engines for XCache
and eAccelerator) and I've come to one really, really scary
conclusion: all they do is make up for the original WP bloat.

And, believe me, I don't say this lightly. I was getting real fed-up
with WordPress dying under joint Slashdot-Digg traffic no matter what
caching solution I used on a dedicated host so I decided to rewrite
the main page and the single-post pages in plain PHP from scratch. I
did - plain PHP & HTML with some simple EZSQL functions, hard-coded
themes, etc. and the difference was unbelievable.

See for yourself:
http://neosmart.net/blog/
vs
http://neosmart.net/blog/page/2/
(page load times at the bottom, current iteration *does* make use of
*object* caching, no HTML cache)

Whereas WP would take 5+ seconds under a *full* load to create a
single page (and far, far too many queries), the rewritten frontend
never went above .01 seconds/page on average at the peak of the
digg-slashdotting effects.

Bottom-line: Caching, in all its forms, is a way to get that last bit
of performance boost to make your app a real killer. It is NOT a way
to make up for badly-performing code in the first place.

I understand the difficulties of making flexible-yet-well-performing
code. I know the tradeoffs between hard-coding stuff and having good
page-load-times. But at the end of the day, /caching is NOT
WordPress's biggest problem/, rather loading too many files at once,
using way more nested loops than it should, and not skipping certain
sections of the code when it can are what's responsible for WP's
"legendary" fear of the /. effect.

A well-written package doesn't need caching of any sort or form, just
a simple opcode cacher in the backend should more than suffice. The
replacement frontend for WP (which I'm considering releasing) was
generating pages in 0.00xx seconds, w/ object caching it does it in
0.000x seconds instead (warm hits, that is). I had attempted to
object-cache everything I could see in a stock WP install, but that
didn't give me anywhere near the performance boost I was looking for.

I'm willing to mentor any performance-related projects for WP.

Very curious about that front page...

Having several WordPress blogs that are under regular Digg/Reddit  
stress, i've found it hard to keep those blogs alive...

If such a project would start, feel free to get me onas a tester. I've  
got quite some experience with load testing.

 You should defiantly release that, I'd be interesting to see what you did.
 Also, what's your server's specs?

In-Reply-To: <47CA2351.5090904@gmail.com>
References: <47CA2351.5090904@gmail.com>
Message-ID: <op.t7du10ykk6w4mc@dd32.no-ip.com>

The wp-filesystem stuff is simply a wrapper that allows WordPress to access the filesystem as the same user as the user who owns the blog.

Let me give a quick explanation of why its needed:
As i'm sure you know, in a Multi-user system, every user has a seperate username, All the files they create are owned by that user.
File systems are designed with security in mind, A user cannot modify another users files unless they've specifically been granted that permission.

Most web servers run as a seperate user (On linux with Apache, This is generally the 'apache', 'www', or 'daemon' user), Here is where the problem lies, Most web servers simply execute the PHP code as that user, And so comes the problem when wordpress attempts to modify a file(ie. a plugin file). The PHP code is running as 'daemon' and attempts to edit a file owned by 'dd32', Most servers will prevent that, as the security layer kicks in.

So, The wp-filesystem wrapper is designed to access the filesystem via ftp OR via direct filesystem functions IF the server is setup to allow it(ie. Windows & IIS, or SuExec under linux), At present for beta testing, Its hard-coded to only do ftp, it'll have that limit removed for release.
By connecting via FTP, It allows WordPress to modify its own files, As while connected via ftp its the user 'dd32' accessing 'dd32's files, And so, everything works correctly.

So in short, ALL it does, is a Filesystem wrapper.
If it needs to connect via ftp, it prompts the user for the user/pass details (I believe it remembers the hostname and whatnot?, just not the password).




The plugin-upgrader simply downloads the latest .zip file from wordpress.org, Initates a wp-filesystem connection, removes the old files, installs the latest files, disconnects to filesystem connection, and its done.

The filesystem information does NOT need to be set during the installer, as its only ever needed once a function which utilises it is called, At present, Thats only the plugin-upgrader, But it'll also be tied to the plugin-installer, It could also be utilised by the plugin/theme/file editor, and the config generator.


Sorry for the ramble, Hopefully it'll be of some use to you.

What doesnt work exactly? whats the error message(if any?)

It doesnt work on a host of mine, Its something to do with the Zip decompression class, I think its due to a 32bit OS(or maybe 64bit OS)

Re: Subversion:
The plugin updater isnt exactly designed for that, Its designed to keep plugins up to date with the latest stable version from wordpress.org

I have a few plugins i keep updated via svn myself, I've simply got a cron job which does an "svn up" on all the plugin folders every night, works pretty nicely for me.

Message-ID: <1204458328.12243.6.camel@rillian.sunriseroad.net>

I've put the following in wp-config.php to share my user tables among
multiple WP installs:

        define ('CUSTOM_USER_TABLE', 'wp_users');
        define ('CUSTOM_USER_META_TABLE', 'wp_usermeta');

However, I'm getting the infamous "You do not have sufficient
permissions to access this page" error, and I'm not the first:

<http://www.google.com/search?q=custom_user_table+"You+do+not+have+sufficient+permissions+to+access+this+page.">

No solutions I've seen worked. My blog prefix is "wp_jv_", so I tried
renaming the meta_keys "wp_capabilities" and "wp_user_level" in
wp_usermeta to "wp_jv_capabilities" and "wp_jv_user_level", but no dice.

Someone also suggested editing the following in
wp-includes/capabilities.php:

        $this->cap_key = $wpdb->prefix . 'capabilities';

to this:

        $this->cap_key = 'wp_capabilities';

No dice.

Obviously, something is broken. Can we try and track down what it is?
It's non-critical for me, but I'd still like to try and get to the
bottom of this.

Just updated my SVN install and noticed that now everything is a fixed width
(designed for a 1024 pixel screen).

Words cannot emphasize how much I am against this. I personally run
1600x1200 for the sole reason of not having to deal with this kinda stuff. I
like my input boxes nice and wide. I like not having to scroll vertically as
much. etc.

I realize it's an easy edit on my part to fix it (and I'll probably release
a plugin to fix this if it stays this way), but please reconsider this
change. All that white space to the right looks ugly as sin and it really
hampers the ease of use of the admin area.

For those on low resolution desktops, here's what I mean:

I know *exactly* what you mean, Others seem to want it small to keep the editing windows down to a managable size (aparantly they dont like full window width editing).

Which is why i made this quick plugin: http://dd32.id.au/wordpress-plugins/remove-max-width/

Just adds a style tag to the admin headers to remove the max-width on the wrap and whatnot.

That worked for me, Dont have any caches enabled?

However, Since WP has the Custom meta table define, Maybe it needs one so as to respect the meta table prefixes?

eg, In  your case, It attempts to load "wp_jv_capabilities" from the table "wp_usermeta", while "wp_usermeta" contains a "wp_capabilities" hey instead...

Message-ID: <ae81acd10803020656s49f8ac87tf74e0a9a47b80d01@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys

Yet another thing from the "I'm not too happy with some details of the
new UI" department. The styling of input elements seems kind of
confusing to me: all are clearly displayed as being input elements,
except the #content <textarea> which always makes me think "damn, the
textarea didn't load". Clicking in the middle of white space to make
an input field appear is not the most natural thing.
1 sshot being worth 1000 words: <http://planetozh.com/temp/wp25_admin_input.gif>

Not sure this is something wanted, or just random styling before
something planned happens? (this feeling applies to the whole UI, btw)

These are good points. The software could make better performance
decisions early in the script. Can you work your ideas into a core
patch?

Failing that maybe Computer Guru you would be interested in mentoring
a student in that or a related project?

It sounds similar to a couple of project ideas Matt included last
year, but that we didn't have a student for:
* A testing suite that measures performance of various components and
can be regularly run against new code.
* Currently WP loads all its code on every page, could a selective
code loading scheme improve performance in a meaningful way?

Message-ID: <cd1a57e60803020854h384fb02ch1220b4c5ea6fe31@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm the author of the OneClick plugin, which allows uploading of themes and
plugins via the zip file or a firefox extension. I've gotten a lot of
positive feedback and many requests to get this merged with the core
wordpress source. I was planning to propose this for Google Summer of code,
but I have been selected as an Intern at Google's India office,
automatically disqualifying me from the program.

But what I've been working on is this:
1. Creating a single frontend and a seperate menu to handle installation and
removal of extensions to wordpress.
2. An uploaded zip file will be unzipped, checked and verified, to prevent
security issues. This means that when the user uploads a zip file, it will
display the details of the plugin or theme that they're using and ask for
confirmation.
3. An accompanying firefox extension will be provided which will allow
people to upload zip files by right clicking on the hyperlink and selecting
one of several wordpress based weblogs to upload it to.
4. It will integrate with the theme and plugin menus. Thus, it will allow
users to not only deactivate plugins and themes from the respective menus,
but delete them from the web server altogether.
5. The methods of interacting with the actual webserver is either through
writing it directly (using php's file copy function) but this creates
difficulties with unix style file permissions, using cURL's ftp to write to
the own webserver, or other conventional methods.

Essentially the goal of this is to bring in good methods of traditional ftp
based installs which cause several difficulties.

I would love feedback on this, and I'm writing it as a direct extension to
wordpress, based on the nightly build as certain changes cannot be brought
on purely using the plugin API.

Thanks
Anirudh

I sent you an email about the problem, I'm having, but to reiterate, the 
latest commit fixes all errors for me. The problem I'm having is 
something entirely different now.

I do think that having both a SVN plugin/theme installer and upgrader is 
an excellent idea along with FTP. I have been thinking about doing that 
also, building a bash script which updates WordPress and all of the 
plugins in one go. However, I think for convenience, I would rather 
checkout the plugin (until the installer is made) and then have 
WordPress update the checkout when I click on the link. It should bypass 
the FTP information.

I'll rather not debate the issue and eventually, I hope to create it 
myself. I think your system is excellent, but I do think that even users 
with Subversion WordPress checkout can use SVN plugin/theme upgrader. 
Until Subversion is supported, your system will work fine (once the 
problem I'm having is worked out).

I don't think I can make a patch with the methods I'm using, because
they're incompatible by definition with the way WP currently does its
thing, and would also change the way WP is extended (see below).

For instance, I have functions grouped into files based on what
requests will call them and *not* what they would do. i.e.:

PerformancePress_Post.php, PerformancePress_Archive.php, etc.

.htaccess files direct requests to the appropriate files, each of
which has functions tailored to its specific category:

RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^$
RewriteRule   ^/\d+/([^/]+)/$  PerformancePress_Post.php?slug=$1
RewriteRule   ^/tag/([^/]+)/$  PerformancePress_Tags.php?tag=$1
......

(and, of course, a catch-all at the bottom to redirect to the original
WP index.php if it's not implemented)

There is some overlap between the different PP libraries, but not
much. (I chose to copy-and-paste overlapping code for that last bit of
"oomph" vs putting it in a single shared file, but I doubt it would
make a big difference if you did).

Core configuration is stored in a config file (completely
object-cached, it's an especially-good candidate for that sort of
caching since it almost never changes and almost always needs to be
called - absolutely no need to hit up the DB for this kind of stuff) -
just object-cache an array called $config[] which contains everything
you need.

Current plugin model is to have plugins include_once() files w/
functions they need - this eliminates the guess work and overheads.

The admin center of course doesn't need to touched - its performance
is of no consequence to anyone anywhere.

Lloyd, I don't have much more to add to that GSoC outline besides what
Matt's already written for performance which is generic enough to
cover everything I've just said. I guess I'll just add myself as a
second mentor for that category if that's OK.

Cheers,
Mahmoud

I found that project to be very interesting. I would rather do the 
Controller project for the GSOC, but I'll do the Controller project 
anyway (which still doesn't mean the core team will accept it).

I've been thinking about both projects, and I have ideas for both. I 
probably don't know as much as Computer Guru on the performance topic, 
but I know some things from working with improving performance at work.

I think out of the box, WordPress should answer several issues.

1. Caching of queries
2. Support Caching sections of pages and/or whole pages and invalidation 
of those caches.
3. Browser Caching Support.

It seems to me, that #3 is only useful for those who visit a WordPress 
web site often (CMS usage) and would be very quick since it would only 
pull from the disk cache on the visitor's drive. However, it is the more 
efficient of the two. Going over it some more, I think it would have to 
have support in the query system with some overhead to tell if the page 
has been modified. I believe there are some headers which can be sent. 
It would help out with CMS projects, which have pages which don't change 
very often.

For #2, if an API existed that allowed themes to cache certain sections, 
pick and choose which parts won't change very often, then a plugin can 
take hold of that and cache just those portions based on what the theme 
says. Also, there would be an API for plugins to invalidate portions. 
Sort of like the widget API, but for caching different sections. There 
would be no built in disk caching out of the box, but caching plugins 
could be made that don't require having any files in the wp-content 
directory.

For #1, WordPress would be using the Object Cache anyway, so no big deal 
there.

That would be for the caching system and then on to the performance 
parts. By using XDebug, you can create a file which tracks the areas 
which cause the most performance hits. This might be with using the 
PHPUnit Performance test object or with creating a file which reads the 
file created by XDebug, parses it, and then outputs the problem areas. 
You could do this in a number of ways (PHP ticks for another), but I 
think creating a custom solution independent of PHPUnit would probably 
be best. This will track parts that need to be optimized.

A third option would be to support Memcache and APC, etc out of the box 
and add them to the Object Cache. They would only be enabled if the 
extension is installed, so only a small initial amount of overhead to 
check every once in a while. If they are enabled then to use them, 
instead of placing the caching in the memory. Out of the box, instead of 
using a plugin. It shouldn't add that much bloat and will allow plugins 
to focus on just disk caching, if it is needed.

Finally, going over the second part's data and optimizing and 
refactoring the problem areas will increase initial performance. What 
Computer Guru says is true, but you can only offset so much with 
optimization before you have to use some form of caching.

For the fourth project item, the only way I can think of is to use 
__autoload() function (or probably the SPL version to allow for multiple 
autoload functions to be added) or to use a Page Controller instead of 
what appears to be a Front Controller, then loading manually what is 
needed. You could also do this by having creating a build system that 
places all of the wp-includes in a single file and including that file. 
You can also have a build system which removes all comments, all 
spaces/tabs and tries to remove as many new lines as possible.

If I were to do the project, I wouldn't even mess with the fourth item, 
unless the mentor has some other idea that I don't on how to implement 
that fourth item. The first three should be enough work on implementing 
correctly, as well as optimizing core WordPress functions.

I found that if you get the first one installed, when you start to  
install the others, it will tell you that the admin user was  
recognized... This is how you know it was successful.

However, the constants weren't recognized when they lived in wp- 
config.php ... I had to actually put them in wp-settings.php. I can't  
understand why the constants couldn't work there, since this is one  
of the first files included (as far as I could tell). Also, I didn't  
need the changes in capabilities.php.

Also, I had to re-install the first one, so that it could hook into  
the shared users table, and have it's own prefix. A better way would  
be to install a 'base' blog, then throw away its other tables (and  
files) after the others are hooked in. Just leave the two user tables  
from it.

Sorry these are from memory (did this 4 months ago for the first  
time). I'll see if I can't come up with a better process, and  
document it somewhere.

Its still wonky, but it does work. I agree that this should be  
improved upon, but it can be made to work, even if you have to  
'jiggle the handle' a bit before it gets going.

Also, I recommend doing this on fresh installs... it will help  
eliminate other possible issues when trouble shooting.

Hope this helps you out some.

If using TMCE you can always go to Fullscreen and have it as big as your 
monitor would let you :)

There are a lot of studies about optimal line length, onscreen 
readability, etc. All suggest that 10" is best, but note that most users 
prefer 6" - 8". The current admin follows these findings.

Also most themes have a fixed width for the post area, usually about 8", 
so keeping TMCE at about 8" wide would mimic how the post will look when 
published.

In any case, try typing a 1000 words post in full screen in TMCE to see 
how it works for you.

Does WP use the Lazy Load design pattern, and if not would it make

No, currently WP loads everything at the beginning and so it's always
there when you need it.

Lazy Load looks interesting, but I don't know how applicable it would
be to the current WP structure. It seems to be geared for the
more-heavily object-oriented languages/projects out there where all
the methods are parts of objects in the first place, and objects are
embedded within objects (class members) for a fully OOP, cascaded
development style.

Imagine:
$blog.
$blog->posts
$blog->posts.filter_by(date,start,end);
...

In that case, you could use the Lazy Load model to have posts called
as you need them as the very simplest example. But the current WP
model is more like
$tag
$posts = <query to get posts with this tag>
$posts //retreived from the DB

In our case, the performance problem isn't with the objects being in
the memory so much as it is the functions to get them....


I could be wrong, of course.

Jacob, would this conform to a more MVC-style approach at content handling?

Also, a quick question: what about the overhead? (way I envision the
implementation is a checking incoming requests against an array of
stack<filters> and if it matches send it to the appropriate handler)
Every single request now has the burden of checking the correct
destination through a number of complicated steps (preg_match, etc.) -
even though most requests will probably pass through un-accosted
(sp?).

I love your attitude! Keeping an open mind until you have measurements
to support the assertions.

I've seen a lot of optimization attempts on various projects that were
trying to squeeze juice out of a potato, if not a rock.

Zend_Framework utilizes this quite a bit so I wouldn't say it is a  
language thing (php's OO shortcomings aside). But the concept of  
loading when needed, instead of all at once seems to be a good way to  
cut back on memory usage. The increase in performance from this, as  
applied to the current WP, is probably debatable, but maybe worth  
discussing.

Maybe this is something that might tie in to a broader discussion of  
re-architecting with PHP5...?

Hi

The jQuery.js file in WP 2.5 (Version 1.2.3/Revision 4663) is not  
identical to the same revision I have just downloaded from jquery.com  
which seems to explain why some code I am working on that uses a  
jQuery plugin does not work with the WP supplied version but does work  
with the authentic one.
Is whatever change that has been made purposeful or is this an  
accident? And if purposeful is there a key to getting jQuery plugins  
to recognise the library?

Thanks, regards

As for the overhead, while thinking about it some more, WordPress 
already does the View and Model parts, which are no problem. Correct me 
if I'm wrong, but the Controller acts as the gatekeeper for which View 
is loaded. If you break it down, the Model is the WordPress API 
contained in wp-includes/. The View part is contained in the theme folder.

If you go off the Zend Framework (which has always confused me on where 
exactly the View takes over), the View is contained within the 
Controller method. The Rewrite component finds the Controller, which 
executes the View, which loads the Template. If you apply this to 
WordPress, the WP_Query is the Rewrite and (Front) Controller, which 
passes to the Template Loader (the View), which loads the Template. That 
is my interpretation, do correct me if I'm wrong.

The improvement will separate the Rewrite component and Controller 
component from the WP Query and improve the Template Loader (View) to be 
an API instead of a logical block specific to WordPress. Also, it might 
be possible to remove the Template Loader file  and be contained in the 
Controller function/method which will automatically load the correct 
files, if the file exists( else load index.php).

There will have to be test cases to tell if the improvements will add 
additional overhead from the current implementation. However, I think 
convenience should trump optimization at any point, but it should be 
optimized as much as possible, while still retaining the feature set 
requirements. You are right about the steps, but usually you place the 
most often used rule at the top (homepage, then single post, then single 
page, etc), with the worse cases and not often used cases at the bottom, 
with a final case to capture everything that isn't captured by the above 
rules (404 in WP case?). Once you find the rule that matches, you stop 
and run the controller portion.

The second feature set, will be to allow for the Controller component to 
be completely replaced, using a system like how the object caching 
replacement works, with something else, including the old system. So I 
think this feature set will have to be one of the first features 
implemented. However, I remember reading that the current Controller can 
already be replaced and there is already a solution which does replace 
the Controller with Zend Framework. I'm unsure how that works, since I 
haven't used it.

Note that the WordPress does in fact implement a simple Rewrite 
component separate from the WP Query component, however that also 
includes the mod_rewrite writing, so what is in the mod_rewrite Writer 
Component will be separated and refactored in to a improved Rewrite 
model supporting the above. While the mod_rewrite Writer will be its own 
component separate from the Rewrite Component.



So with the final improvement the work flow will look a lot like this: 
URL is checked to see if it uses query vars or query string or 
mod_rewrite method -> URL is matched against one of the Rewrite rules -> 
Matched rule loads Controller -> Controller runs View logic loading the 
correct template.

At the very least, it should remove the argument that WordPress doesn't 
do MVC or at least provide a better debate against that argument, 
instead of it, "Kind of follows it, which means it does MVC." Also, 
while hacking WordPress, there have been times when I wanted to 
completely overwrite how the controller system works and this API, would 
allow that to happen without cutting the core to pieces and increasing 
the work load of upgrading.

Thanks for replying to the proposal.

We add one thing to the end:

jQuery.noConflict();

Maybe the plugin uses $() instead of jQuery().

I would say that the problem with the screenshot you are showing is
that we clearly see standard web buttons in the quicktabs bar (i.e.
it's NOT the WYSIWYG interface). In the WYSIWYG version it kind of
makes sense that there's no borders on the textarea, because it looks
like MSOffice or whatever, but when you're using hte oldschool buttons
the border probably makes sense as part of a standard XHTML based  UI.

There has been a lot of discussion regarding changing over to PHP5, 
especially when http://gophp5.org/ started. I believe the decision was 
NOT to require PHP5, but was there any decision as to when the subject 
would be re-addressed?

I personally would not bring up the issue, because it brings out a lot. 
I would suspect that since right now, the requirements are 4.3, which 
offers a lot more functions than 4.2. I don't think that at the moment 
the debate is a bigger deal.

I have said I would bring the issue up August 8, 2008, since that is 
when PHP team is dropping security support. After that, nothing more 
will be done with PHP4 and they are going to focus on PHP5 and PHP6 
only. With that, it would make little sense to still support PHP4, even 
after the PHP team drops support. The core team might not think the same 
way and I think that the hints that there might be a switch to PHP5 from 
at least one core member.

Whether that will happen this year? Who knows. With what I want to do 
and from what the projects are, I would leave the debate out of the GSOC 
discussion. I've learned that it will happen when the core team wants it 
to happen and not any day sooner. So while I personally would like to 
see it happen, debating the issue at this point doesn't seem to be worth 
the time, since it won't go anywhere.

Breaking this out from the caching thread...

Quite a bit of the time it takes to load the front page is spent
pulling in all of our includes.  A lot of stuff is included just in
case a plugin needs it.  Cutting down on what we include by default
seems a worthy goal.

PHP5 will autoload classes, but that doesn't help us since we neither
require PHP 5 nor use many classes.  Another approach would require
plugins to declare what they need to be loaded and only load what is
asked for.  This would break plugin back-compat, but maybe it's worth
it.  Adding a function like
wp_load_functions($set_of_functions_to_load) and reorganizing some of
our includes could go a long way.  For example, post.php currently
defines all post DB functions.  This includes both functions that read
and functions that insert, update, or delete.  Splitting the
insert/update/delete functions out into edit-post.php and loading that
file only when wp_load_function('edit-post') is called would trim
quite a bit of code from our default includes. Doing this for
taxonomy, links, and other areas could greatly reduce the amount of
code PHP has to load and interpret whenever a blog page is visited.

I'd love to streamline includes for 2.6.  Thoughts?

I thought it might be a touchy subject, and didn't mean to have it  
dovetail into the GSoC discussion.

However, it seemed like a logical direction of the discussion... even  
if it might have trailed off topic a bit.

PHP 5 penetration is still ongoing, with even large vendors just know  
starting to support it (case in point, my dedicated server at Media  
Temple just recently started offering a PHP5 version that even I have  
yet to switch to).

I really appreciate everyone's input. This seems to certainly strike a cord
with everyone.
However, after some consideration, I have decided that I will probably
*not* pursue this project as my Summer of Code project. My reasons are as
follows:

- This seems to be a very passionate issue for most people. Everyone has
their opinion as to what method is more important. Some feel we should be
addressing WordPress run on higher end websites (adding support for things
like memcache), while others feel we need to look at running with as little
as possible (loading only the bare minimal code and queries).

- The census appears that instead of putting a band-aid (caching) on a
wound, we should be addressing the real issue, optimization. Unfortunately,
I'm sure if I would be the right person to address optimization. I would
certainly give it my best if I would be working on this over the summer, but
more than likely someone with better experience in that area would do a
better job.

So, yeah, I'm not completely objecting to doing this over the summer, and I
still may if I cannot come up with anything else that people are interested
in, but I would probably be better suited for something else. I feel whoever
tackles the optimization issue should have some background experience in the
area, as most people are looking for some true optimizations, and not some
band-aids.

I can't stand TinyMCE. I delete it's files from all of my non-dev installs.

The major problem I see is that for blogs with a lot of plugins,
everything would be defined anyway because all activated plugins would
still be loaded by default, so the only time this would have any real
benefit is when just code that is rarely used by the core as well as
plugins is removed.

For example, one of my plugins sends an AJAX request to the server to
return the content of a post. The file the request is sent to has to
include the WordPress core -- including all of the plugins, so that
the content of the post is correctly formatted and then sent back.
Under the current system, even small requests have to include
everything to send back a small amount of correctly formatted data. It
isn't pretty, but even including the entirety of WP is smaller than
the amount of work needed to load an entire page. This same process
occurs no matter what else (comments, pages, etc) is requested from
WP.

Even if each plugin only included what it needed, the entirety of the
core would be included because on or another plugin would have needed
it regardless of whether the plugin is actually useful. (For example,
an Admin panel add-on is included no matter what page you are on.)

There needs to be a better way to define what is happening in general
so that WordPress can specifically, and intelligently, select what
plugins and includes are included.

Part of optimizing the core may require that plugins "announce" what
they do, so WordPress knows how to respond: when plugins are
activated, they should define their functionality to WordPress. This
could be as simple as adding a list of functionality in the header of
each file that WordPress can store as part of the plugin data.
That AJAX plugin might have "Functions: posts, comments" while the
Simple Tags plugin might use "Functions: tagging, admin."

This way, WordPress would know that if it was in the admin panel, but
it wasn't on a page related to tagging, Simple Tags wouldn't need to
be loaded, but if it was editing a post or listing categories, it
would, and even if some later plugin defined that it was going to need
tagging functionality, Simple Tags could be included then.

Similarly, for the AJAX plugin, it could define a variable -- or
whatever -- before including wp-config, so that WordPress could "know"
what functions and plugin categories were needed. Normally, doing this
would include the entire core, but if the AJAx plugin was just loading
a post, it would define the variable as such, and WordPress would
_start_ by loading only plugins and functions part of the "post"
group. If other plugins needed more functions, WordPress could spider
out from there to include what it needs.


This ended up longer than what I wanted, so I hope I stayed sem-coherent.

Aaron.

I'll say, this thread is entirely pointless. The best method is to do 
what Computer Guru does. You are better off, just using require_once() 
and having all plugins use that instead of building an API which does 
the same thing.

What Computer Guru does is generally the suggested way to improve 
performance. Which is to have everything in one file that you need and 
only load those files. This would be extremely bad during development, 
and you will have a build system which does it for you. So basically, 
you would determine what each different sections are needed and load 
only those.

I suppose with plugins, it does create a difficult problem. I suggest 
instead of just having everything in one file, which means you only have 
one require() to load everything. This isn't as good as CC methods as 
you'll still have a massive file, but PHP is generally fast at 
compiling, so it shouldn't be that bad.

However, please don't do this for Trunk, it will make it extremely 
difficult to code.

You're right, of course - I can see the overhead being very negligible
if it's properly done.

Not everyone uses a bunch of plugins.  I use only one.

Plugins shouldn't  load their admin code in a non-admin context.

That's pretty much what I'm proposing.  Define groups of
functionality, such as 'edit-posts', and the necessary files are
included.  Plugins already have a way of knowing if they are in an
admin context.  if  (is_admin())
require_once('my-admin-functions.php').  Plugins should take care of
organizing their includes so that only the necessary stuff is loaded
for a given context.

The main thing about this is that the menu and Howdy being all the way 
over to the right is weird, that should be constrained as well.

P.S. You should really try out full-screen mode on TinyMCE, it's fun.

>

I disagree, on the grounds that the proposed API will increase overhead,
not decrease it and will over complicate includes.

#1

if( is_admin() )
   require_once( ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/some_file.php' );

1. Compiler compiles branch
2. Compiler skips over require_once()
3. PHP Executor parses over branch, checks to see that it evaluates to true
4. Runs require_once()
5. File is passed to PHP Compiler.

Now take APC for instance. APC can not cache some_file.php until #5. In
which case, the file would have already been cached if the branch was not
there.

#2

someplugin.php

wp_include_file('some_file.php', WP_INCLUDES_ADMIN);


wp-includes/functions.php

function wp_include_file($file, $dir = '')
{
    if( file_exists( ABSPATH . slashit($dir) . $file ) )
        include_once(ABSPATH . slashit($dir) . $file);

    else {
        if( 'edit_posts' == $file )
            require_once( ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/posts.php' );
        else if( ... )
            require_once( ABSPATH . ... );
        ...
    }
}

Lets say for a moment that it takes 0.001 seconds overhead to run the
function line. So each call to wp_includes_file() has 0.0001 + the time it
takes execute the function.

So if you have 100 function calls, it automatically takes 0.01 seconds to
even start up the function call. If you have a 1000 function calls, that
is 0.01 seconds. That doesn't count the best case when the file exists. If
the capability type system is used for convenience, then each branch will
have to be executed until the correct one is found.

If you have 10 branches, then the best case would be the first would be
picked, but that is not likely to be the case. Just imagine the overhead
if you had a 100 branches or use a database!

This system also totally circumvents opcode caches like APC.

There's an excellent source of ideas that would matter to regular users:

http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/

Also I think all proposals should decide up front whether their success 
will be measured as a plugin in the plugin directory or as a core patch.

One more thing I haven't seen anyone bring up yet - improvements to

I'm working on something at the moment that I think you should add to
wordpress.org, but I'll have to talk to Alex Shiels first. Basically, how
about a continuous integrated type of system, which tracks the SVN +
WordPress Testing SVN to let testers know if there is any breakage.

I have a basic system in place, but it is crap. Just terrible code. I was
planning on improving it and I have to before WordCamp Dallas. However,
while I think it would be great, I'll rather get Alex's opinion on the
updated code (when I get around to write it).

There are other better Continuous Integrated systems out there (Bitten
might be cool in another year or so).

Found out something odd today, if you put a blank index.php in the plugins
folder, the Dashboard link will point to
wp-admin/admin.php?page=index.phpinstead, which is a blank page (with
the usual Admin styling).

Happens in both 2.3.3 and 2.5.

I think given the fact that the number one most requested feature on the
ideas page is an automated upgrade process, it may be a good idea to
integrate this into the core.  I believe there's at least one plug-in that
already accomplishes this, but it seems like a lot of the people who would
be using the feature in the first place [either less than fully comfortable
with uploading/changing files or just lazy] wouldn't want to be installing
plugins anyway.  In any case, the core integration probably wouldn't be
enough to warrant a GSoC project by itself, so perhaps combining it with
another idea or few from the top of the list?  I'm just trying to figure out
how much work qualifies for a full GSoC proposal before I get around to
writing one or a few of them up...

Just don't name anything plugin.php in the plugins folder, or at least
keep it blank.

Rename the file index.htm, which should fix your problem.

Jacob, I think covering more of the code with unit tests and getting
the idea of testing closer to the WordPress culture would be a better
idea than a continuous integration system. There is no point of
running tests every hour if there are no, or rarely/poorly written
tests.

Happy hacking,
Nikolay.

Not totally, but some parts are circumvented.  Top loading is
definitely faster than conditional loading with APC.  Most people
don't have any sort of opcode cache, however.  Not loading and
interpreting a bunch of stuff will be faster for them, even given the
overhead of conditional loading.  At least my half-assed profiling
awhile back suggested it is faster.  Better profiling is needed for
anything we decide to do, and we need to take into account operating
both with and without an opcode cache.

Some interesting links discussing conditional loading and caching:

Dan,

In 2.5, there is currently a filesystem class library which will make it
easier to build a plugin which also upgrades WordPress. However, you have
to keep in mind that some users manually update core WordPress files, so
you would have to move the old version, so that the user can transfer the
previous changes and make diffs.

I think that if the plugins upgrader works out well enough, that a next
version will have the WordPress Upgrader using the same system.

I think that it is already something that might be done before the year is
over. I think that you have 2.6 and 2.7 coming out this year. At the very
latest, if the plugin upgrader works well for enough people, that it will
be in 2.7. If it is in 2.6, then it will be well before the Summer of Code
is complete.

Mr. Awesome says: He agrees with the others about the "fixed-width"

in certain areas of the Control Panel. Example: Write Post page, Media 
Library (Has a HUGE one), Manage > Posts landing page don't have one 
now, but I'm sure it will happen sooner or later. The right side (where 
the post's status is) is currently near snug with the Vertical Scroll 
Bar as of now....

Things are being pushed towards the right of page, and I'm thinking it's 
padding on SOME of the areas.... but the fixed-width settings aren't 
helping either sigh. It's not really THAT bad though, it could be worse 
all over... I suppose it's just near impossible to please everyone 
though... *Shrug*

After reading some more, I'll have to agree that conditional includes
aren't worthwhile.  They will result in poorer performance for those
using APC, and those are the people who are most concerned about
performance.

So, let's move the discussion to having plugins do direct includes of
what they need.  Would breaking some of the includes into smaller
pieces that could be direct loaded be beneficial?  Obviously loading
20 files is not as fast as loading one huge file, but if it means
intrepreting half as much code we might see an improvement.

As for plugins conditionally loading files with an is_admin()
conditional, I don't think this hurts us since plugins are already
conditionally loaded.  I guess no plugins get the full opcode caching
treatment.  Are there any documents out that tell you how to code for
maximum opcode cache performance?

Ha ha, I just thought of something which is funny. You could basically
create a PHP extension, which takes all of the files in wp-includes and
"autoloads" them. You wouldn't even need that much C to do so. The nice
thing, is that it would be easy to keep the extension updated to the
latest of WordPress.

Here is the funny part: Basically, during the PHP Init stage, it will take
all of the PHP files and compile them. Okay, this is painful for CGI SAPI.
However, for mod_php and FastCGI, the files would always exist within PHP,
unless the process/PHP thread is closed. The files would only be compiled
once and the compiled version will exist for each PHP process.

The pooteeweet.org blog post is basically saying the same thing I'm
saying, since I've read the blog post a while ago and the follow
discussions explaining what Rasmus was saying. You need a Masters degree
sometimes...

You know, all four resources back up my arguments perfectly. Thank you for
doing my research for me. I will suggest that you reconsider writing the
API, because your time could be better placed with creating some super
cool feature that users and developers actually need. No offense, if I was
an ass.

You weren't. Anyhow, I've been an engineer long enough, and have done
open source long enough to have an elephant hide.

The API is out.  I'll continue researching whether further include
file reorganization is worthwhile.  It'll all come down to the
numbers.

And, of course, everyone is welcome to fire up their profilers and fix
slow performing functions.  We did  a bit of that for 2.5 and removed
several time wasters, but there are lots of other places that need
tuning.

Thanks Nikolay,

I would take that advice, but I've already invested enough time into a
working solution. Actually, I built it because I found the CGI method
wasn't working for me. The feature set that I need to finish, I suspect
will take no more than 8 straight hours.

I should probably clarify for those who know what a continuous integration
system is, which my system is not. Well, not really. Basically, I want it
to run every hour and run the tests and record the system so that visitors
can see the results.

I think that Alex (and any others working on the unit tests) to get the
amount of current tests. While I agree that there aren't a lot, I still
think that there are enough and eventually will be a complete coverage of
functions and methods. Down the road, but it will be far interesting now
for testers.

However, I'll be hosting it on my server regardless of what anyone thinks.
I'll let you know how many hits I get (I predict at least 1 person will
visit the site every now and again).

As for the amount of test cases, I hope that my session does something
about that. I hope to also do something about that, however my personal
timeline has been extended to around September-ish.

Improving the Test Cases could also be a GSOC project, however, I think
people should be writing test cases and sending them to Alex regardless.

Subject: [wp-hackers] no-code-duplication i18n for WordPress
Message-ID: <20080303080036.GA27131@capsaicin.mamane.lu>

Hello,

I'm Lionel Elie Mamane, I recently got involved in the Debian
packaging of WordPress, and I'd like to propose you an enhancement in
your full-i18n procedures, so that all languages are guaranteed to
use the same code, only strings differ. I come bearing "proof of
concept" patches, available from
http://people.debian.org/~lmamane/wordpress/ .

HISTORY
=======

Originally, all I wanted was to have French WordPress packaged in
Debian, but then I saw there were code differences (in version 2.3.2)
that might have been security issues (or not) between the English and
French versions, so I decided to add all the French support I could to
Debian's WordPress package (that is the ll_CC.js files and the .mo
files, and a few code differences that would not break the English).

Then, Nikolay Bachiyski and I started discussing why things were as
they were in WordPress and started brainstorming for a way to improve
them that would not get in the way of English version development too
much. That discussion is at http://bugs.debian.org/461617, but its
result is summarised below, so you don't need to go read it all unless
you want to.

I18N PROBLEMS IN CURRENT WORDPRESS
==================================

As you probably all know, the main problem is that some strings
(mainly error messages) are output before gettext is loaded / ready to
be used, so these strings cannot be translated by gettext and are
nowadays hard-coded in the source. Translating WordPress into a new
language entails forking the code and translating these hard-coded
strings. A work continuously to be redone for new releases.

THE PROPOSAL
============

I absolutely want all language versions of WordPress to share the same
code. That is so that it is less work Debian-wise to ship them all,
and also so that security updates need to update only one copy of the
code. Only one copy -> less work, none is forgotten.

To achieve that, the idea is that fully-localised versions are
generated automatically from the English version by replacing the
hard-coded strings in a build stage. You can still ship
already-translated sources tarballs for your users. This allows Debian
to easily ship all (no 15 tarballs to download and package, only one
and then a build stage), this allows you to easily get out security
updates for all languages at once (correct in English source, run
build stage for every language, tar the 15 obtained trees, upload,
announce), ... To make implementation easier, the strings to be
statically translated are tagged with special comments.

I implemented a script to do this build stage; the patch (against
trunk as of yesterday) is at
http://people.debian.org/~lmamane/wordpress/no-code-dup-i18n-poc.patch

It adds a "i18n-tools" directory to the wordpress source tree, but we
can also put it elsewhere (the code is location-independent), no
problem. It creates a README file in that explains how it works.

There is a (partial) example .po file for French for this static
translation at http://people.debian.org/~lmamane/wordpress/fr.po .

The patch also tags two strings in the code (those that are in the
fr.po), for tests and such. For now, they are only tagged as-is,
meaning that they are cut at the places where there are variable
references in the "-delimited string. That is bad, they should be
converted to sprintf (as the README says, like for gettext-translated
strings); I'll do it soon, I wanted to get this email out rather
sooner than later.

Let me know what you think, whether I should finish that thing up and
tag all remaining strings, etc.


REMAINING ISSUES
================

The list of languages supported by the spellchecker in TinyMCE is
hardcoded; it should be dynamically constructed to be what is
installed on this particular server.


Best Regards,

There shouldn't be any broken plugins, since no plugins should be
including anything within wp-includes/ and if they are, then they are
already broken regardless of WordPress version. Now wp-admin includes, did
break some plugins, which depended on the two admin function includes,
which were broken up and moved elsewhere.

If a build system were made which combined all of the files in
wp-includes/ into one, then it would be faster, based off the sources in
Ryan's post.

I would only this be done for releases, but developers might become upset
if they manually update core files. It wouldn't be pretty for any kind of
development.

Excellent idea. I'll just drop all the tables and start again, with the
CUSTOM_USER_TABLE constants defined from the start.

If that doesn't fix it, nothing will.

Ah, well...currently all my plugins are up-to-date AFAIK. I've been 
checking the Plugin page lately, and nothing is letting me know of 
out-dated plugins and such. I could try some things out soon though, 
most likely one of these upcoming evenings after work.

Ahh, okay. I'm following you now. Thanks Jacob. =)

That's true.

Thanks for the short and sweet description of how it works. =) So 
basically, instead of having that older method (where that yellow-ish 
banner like thing is showing under a specific out-dated plugin) of 
letting you know if a plugin is out-dated, it will give a link for you 
to click and enter FTP informations and then technically auto-update 
itself using FTP or whatever right?

Also, are specific folders going to need a specific CHMOD setting prior 
to doing this FTP-ing? Like, ROOT/ 777 or 755, wp-content/ 777 or 755 or 
whatever? I don't mind doing the chmod thing, if it's only a temporary 
thing. Just wondering if this is going to need chmod similar to when ya 
upload images via the Write Post page... I had to chmod the 
wp-content/uploads/ folder(s) 777 I think it was, in order for it to 
work. But to me, leaving 777 chmod on folders is a baaaad thing to do... 
So I basically stopped uploading images via the Write Post section and 
rechmod the folders 755/ text files 644.

I'll have to try and test this out sometime this week. Probably the 
beginning of the week, after work some time. End of the week is going to 
be really really busy for me...

Sorry. There is a trac ticket, which might be of some interest to you.
There is a patch already for solving this issue. It would help out, if you
could test the patch and see if it works for you.

I want to say DD32 made the ticket, but there are other great bug
reporters, so I might be getting them confused.

That's true. Sorry about that, I was mixing up the Includes 
folders/files location. The "file call" in a plugin that I had edited 
before WAS the wp-admin/includes...

http://spencerp.net/id/50

For example only:

Change this:
include_once (ABSPATH.?/wp-admin/upgrade-functions.php?);

To This:
include_once (ABSPATH.?/wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php?);

So you're right Jacob. Thanks for pointing it out. =)

I agree with you. I think it'd be nicer to have most of them combined, 
however, it would really become a messy situation. Not to mention 
digging through HUGE amounts of code to "change up" things later down 
road or whatever. I love the "FIND / REPLACE" feature in Notepad2 and 
MetaPad, but, I don't think that'd be a nice thing to do while going 
through THAT MUCH code lmao.

This is an "old" problem, which is even broader: PHP files in 
/wp-content/plugins/ take over their /wp-admin/ homonyms (ie a blank 
themes.php in the plugins directory will take over the "Presentation" 
page, and so on).

I proposed a fix & patch [1] to this 6 months ago, but it didn't seem to 
raise any interest.

By "elsewhere" I meant it can also be out of the WP source tree

Yes, that is one of my pet issues, too. I strongly think that if
people think that without the fixed width, it is too wide, then it is
their browser's bug that it shows it too wide. If the CSS/HTML does
not give a width, then the browser should pick a good one, depending
on user's preferences.

Message-ID: <cd1a57e60803030429w62936aa3j36ef7360552fd1d8@mail.gmail.com>

I have a plugin that installs other plugins.
The tasks are as follows:
1. My plugin detects the details of this new plugin
2. The new plugin is uploaded to the right directory and automatically
activated.

I am currently activating the plugin by directly modifying the
"active_plugins" option, similar to how wordpress does. This is going to be
done with the user's consent of course, but is there any security risk
involved in that?

Also what function does wordpress use to detect details of plugins and
themes, I'm using regular expressions but they're not as good as detecting
the details like wordpress is.

Thanks a lot and have a great day
Anirudh

(I might be wrong, but) I think there's no particular risk in doing this 
per se. It all really depends on *how* you're doing it, like passing 
arguments via POST or GET, etc, that could eventually lead to remote code 
execution and this kind of stuff. But if done properly, it shouldnt be any 
more risky than clicking on 
plugins.php?action=activate&plugin=this&nonce=that

wp-admin/includes/themes.php for themes explains it all
get_plugin_data($file) does the job for plugins

The problem is I won't be having access to the nonce. So I'll have to
activate the plugin bypassing wordpress. during the testing I found if a
plugin has a fatal error(the one you're trying to install), it will go ahead
and activate anyways, while a regular wordpress plugin activation detects an
error and shuts it down.

Thanks for the information.

Yeah. You're right. I like that there are other methods, so if your host 
is using suPHP, that you might not even need to use FTP. So, the system 
is pretty sweet.

I think DD32 can probably answer your question better. If you are having 
to change to 777, then your host probably isn't using suPHP. FTP should 
be signed in as the user that made the files, so 755 should work. Other 
than that, it appears you know what you are doing.

The more people that test it out and provide feedback to DD32 and the 
core team, the better the feature will be regardless of the method used. 
I really, really like the feature and I suspect many others will also.

I've actually implemented a similar feature except it uses direct php
unzipping rather than FTP.
Though it will be good to provide FTP support too. Can I have a look at your
code please?

I have to say that as long as small screen sizes are well-served,
accommodating huge screen widths isn't something that in my mind
trumps the usability improvements for most people of having a
reasonable width for writing in. I would speculate that many people
can benefit from slimmer content fields without knowing about it, so
even if they CAN resize their window, they just won't think to do so.
Thus I think working a humane width into the design by default is a
good idea (I personally use CSS stylesheets to change the full-size
display of images in Safari and stuff like that, but of the normal
users I've spoken to, most don't even think of things like bumping up
font sizes when it's too small to read, so expecting them to
investigate their browser looking for preferences that will modify
field widths is probably unrealistic).

That said, I am also in deep hate with the left-alignment of the whole
page content, it's kind of insane to me. You say that most blogs have
a fixed width content well, well they are usually also center-aligned,
having things on the left always feels like 1997 to me.

Here's a screenshot with the whole thing centered and the top-right
menus accounted for. I think it solves 90% of the aesthetic concerns
expressed above, and anyone who really needs a huge-width content
field can easily use a plugin or 2 lines in admin.css to get what they
want.

I don't know, but to me this seems more of a potential pro and less of
a con.... I can imagine how it would simplify hacking the wp-admin
center without ever needing to load the WP codebase in the first
place.

It's drawback seems to be pretty minor to me, no reason to put a blank
____.php file there in the first place (as mentioned above, a blank
index.html file should take care of the directory access) and it's
benefits would seem to outweigh the "weirdness" of the issue, but
that's just me :-)

Oh, this one drove me absolutely nuts for about three days a year or two
ago...

I could NOT figure out what happened to the site.  I was not in a happy
mood...

I'm in agreement here. I think keeping the admin the full width of the
browser is the most logical behavior. Like any other piece of
software, users can and will size the window like they want it. That
makes more sense, to me, than preventing users from having a full-
width admin if they want it (or having to resort to plugins for such
an obvious behavior).

Although I personally rather the admin panel aligned to the left, perhaps it
could be an idea to give users a choice between the two. A radio button
choice in the "Misc" section of "Options" with:

* Fixed width
* Fluid width

Or something along those lines. We can add a class to the <body> tag to say
whether its fluid or fixed, so styling it would be a piece of cake.

There seems to be lots of people in favor of both routes, and giving them
both is possible, so why not? Just my two cents :P

In practice, Windows apps (more so than Mac apps) are generally used
full-screen.

Well-designed sites and web apps take that into account by using either (1)
use a fixed-width layout (i.e. A List Apart), or (2) use a fluid layout but
ensuring that line lengths remain reasonable through fixed-width containers
(i.e. Google Reader).

TinyMCE is hardly fun IMO. I only have it enabled there for testing my

Please provide pointers to studies backing that up.  I've never known
that to be the case.

I generally never use apps in full-screen mode on my Windows machines,
slide-shows typically being the exception.

I use 1920x1200 monitors (both on the desktops and the laptop).  I've
resized my browser so that e.g. the WordPress admin screens are at a
comfortable width to work on.

I don't really care what the WordPress default is, as long as it can be
modified with a plugin.  Of course, my preference would be for a fluid
layout like before, to match my current work habits.

Best regards,

Kimmo, I think what he meant was Windows apps tend to be used in "maximized"
mode, rather than fullscreen.  I personally tend to conform to that
standard, but I can't speak for statistics...

Personally I liked the first layout most, with the "fluid" right margin. 
It made the page look well balanced even in very wide window. The only 
problem with it was that it needed to shrink to about 10px at 800px wide 
window and grow from there faster.

While trying different ways to put min-width in IE6 without breaking 
anything, one of the layouts was to split the page into 3 main blocks: 
editor, submitbox and settings, then float them all left, so they would 
line up horizontally in wide window or drop one under the other in 
narrow window. That looked good too, although a bit unexpected.

I agree with some others, I would just add a blank index.html file to 
those areas, instead of having the blank index.php file. Usually when 
people see an index.html file within sub-folders, they pretty much 
already figure it's a blank file. Especially if it's nested within 
sub-folders of a software where the main files are PHP code based.

Noobs FTP-ing files, browsing through directories might accidentally 
relocate it else where (possibly screwing up their blog some how, by 
maybe putting in the root directory), or even just think it's there for 
a specific reason or function. I know I was like .. "wtf!?" at first, 
until I viewed the source of the file in the FTP client... This was a 
while back though, when first starting to use WordPress, or when they 
first added those files there...

I know it might seem like it's not uniform with the rest of the file(s) 
because it don't have the .php extension on the end of it, but I don't 
see the harm in having an "index.html" file there instead of index.php, 
you already have the readme.html file in the root. Most people will 
figure or know it's a blank file anyway... Well, you'd think anyway. lol!

It happens also with every plugin that plugs themselves into the main  
page, like search meter [1] or owa [2].
I thought it was already reported but I can't find the ticket.

I know a number of (non-geek) Windows users who don't even know that  
you _can_ run their browser smaller than fullscreen.

I doubt you'll find a lot of studies, but there's a whooooole lot of  
anecdotal evidence.  It's a trend -- nobody claimed it was an absolute.

Here's another bit of anecdotal evidence for you: Look at the number  
of fixed-width sites out there that assume ~ 1000 px wide.  That's  
aimed squarely at Joe User running 1024x768 maximized.  I visited  
three bank websites the other day, and they _all_ did it.

> I generally never use apps in full-screen mode on my Windows machines,
> slide-shows typically being the exception.

Yes, but you're a geek. ;)

Personally, I prefer sites that are designed fluid up to a point --  
that is, max-width.  Even better if based on em or %, so that as font  
size rises, so does the width.  Looks good on a smaller screen (or  
small window), and scales well on higher resolutions if the user  
bumps the font size.

Oh, and one last point -- many browsers allow you to resize a text  
window.  Safari, for one.  i think Firefox too, with a plugin....

You can find the code in the WordPress trunk. 

However, I'm interested in your Unzipping, At present, WP is using a pure-php unsipping method as you've noticed, Its got some limitations on certain setups(In the sense that it simply doesnt work -- i think it reaches the limit of an int..). What it really needs IMO is to use the PHP Zip extension if available, else use the zlib library if compiled in(90% of situations i think?) else revert to pure php.

Does anyone have any experience in unzipping files via ftp? any comments that can be thrown in?

No, It shouldnt need to be done, Having read/write by the owner is all thats needed (644 i think)

In some cases, I think you need to have the uploads folder chmod'd (This is seperate from the wp-filesystem stuff) to allow uploads, i *think*, but WP does get around it usually (Until you goto wipe the WP installation and you cant delete the uploads.. somethings i've come accross a few times now)

I had to chmod the wp-content/uploads/ folder(s) 777 I think it was, in order for it to work. But to me, leaving 777 chmod on folders is a baaaad thing to do... So I basically stopped uploading images via the Write Post section and rechmod the folders 755/ text files 644.

Ah.. I should've read the rest of your comment :P
If you had to chmod the folder to 777 to allow writing, then PHP cant just write directly into your folder without the permissions first being relaxed, Thats why the FTP support was written in to this, It allows PHP to communicate with the filesystem as the same user that you'd log in with FTP, it means, that PHP can read/write your files without any permission errors, or permissions needing to be relaxed.

It doesnt help much with the Image uploading(Hey, I dont think i'd want to have to put my ftp password in everytime i uploaded something) problems, but for pure administrative functions, its a much easier situation for the end user.

Hi, Lionel

You should probably also post this on the polyglots maillist, as that
is where discussion about internationalization happens.
http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-polyglots

>From what you are proposing here, you would like to add comments to
the directly hard-coded English texts in the WP source codes, right?
That will not affect any functionalities, but will help the automatic
build process in the Debian packaging. This sounds like a great idea.

One comment here: in WP2.5, TinyMCE strings will all be translated
using gettext, so that is one less thing to worry about.

I'll reply to you both after a bit here, I just wanted to send through 
here my results on first attempt at this...

a) No folder chmodding at all, I purposely downloaded Contact Form 7 
version "1.6" knowing there was a later version for it. Immediately was 
shown there was an update available. (This without activating the plugin 
too.)

b) Clicked the "update automatically" link.

c) Filled in the fields for the FTP informations...

d) Hit the button, then got this message

"Downloading update from 
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/contact-form-7.1.7.6.zip

Unpacking the update

Removing the old version of the plugin

Could not remove the old plugin"

Again, the ABOVE was WITHOUT any folder Chmodding first!

Okay, then tried same method as above, but with Chmodding the ROOT 
folder, wp-content, plugins, the actual plugin folder itself for 
contact-form-7 .... chmodded them all 777, hit the button.... And got 
the SAME message too.

"Downloading update from 
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/contact-form-7.1.7.6.zip

Unpacking the update

Removing the old version of the plugin

Could not remove the old plugin"

The above two attempts were using the SSL option. Tried once with the 
folders 777, without SSL option and still same thing. "Could not remove 
the old plugin" message.

Heh, same,  I thought it was a plugin for awhile, and never bothered to see
which one. When I did disable all the plugins and it was still screwed up,
that annoyed me. However, I accidentaly messed up the permissions on my
wp-content dir, and I noticed it was fixed, and that's when I dug deeper
into the problem, and tried deleting that index.php file.

It doesn't really matter though, since I have IndexIgnore set in my
.htaccess, it was just in case I deleted that line or something. Also, I
have DirectoryIndex set to index.php, and index.html doesn't work. :P

If the permissions are lax enough, we should probably default to doing 
the simplest thing possible, namely local file operations without 
messing with FTP/etc.

By "lax enough", I hope you're not meaning... "quick everyone, chmod the

LOL, it is funny that two people using the same host can have completely 
different problems. I feel for DD32. However, I'm using the Private 
Server solution, if that helps, but I've never had a problem with 
dreamhost forcing 777, since they've always used suPHP with me.

Probably check the "Use Extra Security..." Checkbox in the domain 
hosting configuration and see if that helps.

Good point, people with suPHP shouldn't have any file perm issues and we 
wouldn't need to do FTP hoops with them either.

Or you can just add a <link rel="alternate stylesheet"> to the <head>
which contains the necessary extra styles.

In fact, why don't we ship WP with an alternate stylesheet with this
tweak? That way, people like me can finally shut up about it, and it
doesn't affect those who like it fixed width.

The alternate stylesheet doesn't have to have anything more than:

body {
	width: 100%;
}

...or however the fluid width got achieved last time.

I should make a patch.

I dont think all browsers handle alternate stylesheets. I'd prefer the
Option way, but I have the feeling it won't make it through...

OK, will do.

Yes, but not only that. When the directly hard-coded English texts in
the WP source code contain variable references, I'd like replace to
replace them by a sprintf.

For example,
 wp_die("Could not connect to DB", 'Fatal Error');
would become
 /* WP_I18N_START */ wp_die("Could not connect to DB", 'Fatal Error'); /* WP_I18N_END */
but
 wp_die("Could not connect to DB host $db, maybe it is down?", 'Fatal Error');
would become
 /* WP_I18N_START */ wp_die(sprintf("Could not connect to DB host %s, maybe it is down?", $db), 'Fatal Error'); /* WP_I18N_END */

That is so that the .po file entries for the second example look like:
 msgid "Could not connect to DB host %s, maybe it is down?"
(one entry with the full format string) and not
 msgid "Could not connect to DB host "
 msgid ", maybe it is down?"
(two entries with pieces of sentences).

The suggestion is that this become your localisation teams' way to
produce localised WP tarballs, too. They would do something like:

 - download http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
 - download wp-static.pot (the .pot file with the hard-coded English
   strings that are tagged with the special comments, automatically
   generated by my script).
 - produce the LL.po, compile it to LL.mo
 - tar xfz latest.tar.gz
 - /path/to/wp-i18n-tools/translate-static wordpress /path/to/mofile
 - tar cfz wordoress wordpress-LL-VERSION.tar.gz
 - upload the tar to their usual place, put the LL.po file in the i18n
   SVN, ...

This allows them not to have to play catch-up with code changes: code
automatically stays the same, they only have to deal with strings and
.po files and my script does the rest.

And indeed, the plan for Debian is that we won't muck with all the
wordpress-LL-VERSION.tar.gz, only download the English one, scrape the
i18n SVN for all the .po files (I already have the script written for
that) and then run "translate-static" to create all internationalised
versions. This allows Debian to contain (as far as _source_ is
concerned) only one copy of the code, only one copy to update on
updates (whether security updates or new version updates or bugfix
updates).

I add myself to the discussion here to remeber to consider hosts that
have implemented method that don't need to chaneg permission cause all
the operation done on filesistem works under the same owner of the
dirs (at the moment i don't remeber how this server implementation is
called). Here in Italy has a tons of WP installation and at end of
2006 we worked toghether with them me and ryan to solve problem
uploading files cause when WP was creating myear and month directory
it forced permission and later upload didnt' works.

Some plugins has problem too, cause they check to see if a dir has the
desired permission instead to do the operation and check later if fail
or not. So please take care for this situation if not alrady
considerated.

Sorry if i was ot about the core of the thread.

(Sorry for the quasi-dupe on wp-hackers, just making sure the whole
discussion spans the two mailing lists.)

Hello,

I'm Lionel Elie Mamane, I recently got involved in the Debian
packaging of WordPress, and I'd like to propose you an enhancement in
your full-i18n procedures, so that all languages are guaranteed to
use the same code, only strings differ. I come bearing "proof of
concept" patches, available from
http://people.debian.org/~lmamane/wordpress/ .

HISTORY
=======

Originally, all I wanted was to have French WordPress packaged in
Debian, but then I saw there were code differences (in version 2.3.2)
that might have been security issues (or not) between the English and
French versions. I'm talking about differences like:

-       <input type="hidden" name="redirect_to" value="<?php echo attribute_escape($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]); ?>" />
+       <input type="hidden" name="redirect_to" value="<?php echo wp_specialchars($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]); ?>" />

Maybe attribute_escape and wp_specialchars do the same thing, I dunno,
but, well, ... this was not very confidence-inspiring.

Then, Nikolay Bachiyski and I started discussing why things were as
they were in WordPress and started brainstorming for a way to improve
them that would not get in the way of English version development too
much. That discussion is at http://bugs.debian.org/461617, but its
result is summarised below, so you don't need to go read it all unless
you want to.

I18N PROBLEMS IN CURRENT WORDPRESS
==================================

As you probably all know, the main problem is that some strings
(mainly error messages) are output before gettext is loaded / ready to
be used, so these strings cannot be translated by gettext and are
nowadays hard-coded in the source. Translating WordPress into a new
language entails forking the code and translating these hard-coded
strings. A work continuously to be redone for new releases.

THE PROPOSAL
============

I absolutely want all language versions of WordPress to share the same
code. That is for several reasons:

 - less work Debian-wise to ship them all
 - security (and other) updates need to update only one copy of the
   code.

Only one copy -> less work, but also one is sure that none is
forgotten. I feel it is too easy for localisation teams to forget one
code change or the other in their version n to version n+1 work.


To achieve that, the idea is that fully-localised versions are
generated automatically from the English version by replacing the
hard-coded strings in a build stage. You can still ship
already-translated sources tarballs for your users. This allows Debian
to easily ship all supported languages (no 15 tarballs to download and
package, only one and then a build stage), this allows you to easily
get out security updates for all languages at once (correct in English
source, run build stage for every language, tar the 15 obtained trees,
upload, announce), ... To make implementation easier, the strings to
be statically translated are tagged with special comments.

I implemented a script to do this build stage; the patch (against
trunk as of Sunday) is at
http://people.debian.org/~lmamane/wordpress/no-code-dup-i18n-poc-v2.patch



For example, in the WordPress source,
 wp_die("Could not connect to DB", 'Fatal Error');
would become
 /* WP_I18N_START */ wp_die("Could not connect to DB", 'Fatal Error'); /* WP_I18N_END */
and the localisation teams get a .pot file with
 msgid "Could not connect to DB"
 msgstr ""
 msgid "Fatal Error"
 msgstr ""
they then do their po-work as usual, e.g.:
 msgid "Could not connect to DB"
 msgstr "?chec lors de la connexion ? la base de donn?es"
 msgid "Fatal Error"
 msgstr "Erreur fatale"
produce mo-file and the "translate-static" script I propose would go
through the source and replace
 /* WP_I18N_START */ wp_die("Could not connect to DB", 'Fatal Error'); /* WP_I18N_END */
by
 /* WP_I18N_START */ wp_die("?chec lors de la connexion ? la base de donn?es", 'Erreur fatale'); /* WP_I18N_END */



My current patch adds a "i18n-tools" directory to the wordpress source
tree, but we can also put it elsewhere (the code is
location-independent), no problem. For example in
http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-i18n/tools/ .

It creates a README file in that explains how it works.

There is a (partial) example .po file for French for this static
translation at http://people.debian.org/~lmamane/wordpress/fr.v2.po;
it is only a quick example for tests, translation is not "release
quality".

The patch also tags two strings in the code (those that are in the
fr.po), for tests and such.


Let me know what you think, whether I should finish that thing up and
tag all remaining strings, etc.



REMAINING ISSUES
================

The list of languages supported by the spellchecker in TinyMCE is
hardcoded; it should be dynamically constructed to be what is
installed on this particular server. (Any volunteer to take care of
that, code-wise?)


Plugin descriptions will have to be converted to being translated
with gettext, too. (Any volunteer to take care of that, code-wise?)


Any other issue you see?


Best Regards,

Firstly, the zlib library is there in under 5% of the situations.

I used a php file to unzip files, a phpzip library actually. But turns out
that on some servers, there are some difficulties that the files created are
registered to the php "user" and ftp cannot delete them. Since this is on
unix based systems, I overcame this by using
<?php
exec("tar -xvwf $filename");
?>
And the other regular method can work as a fallback method.

Based on the Google Analytics data for sites I'm dealing with, that is
the common minimum area for the top 2-3 screen (monitor) sizes.

Because site designers always have more data available than will fit on
the screen comfortably, they choose to treat the (most common) screen
size as the space available for them.  Some remember to subtract a few
pixels for browser elements (e.g. scroll bar, window title, menus etc).

This means that people with small screens practically have no other
option than to run their browser maximized.

This is probably one of those chicken-or-egg situations... :)

Guilty as charged.  :)

Excellent tip -- thank you!  I hadn't thought of that and have been
using px with max-width.  Will be using em in the future.

Ok, So i got my numbers mixed up, 90% of situations its not available :P

Thats basically the current method, Except it uses the filesystem wrapper(direct or ftp access) so that the files are owned by the same user, that way, they can be deleted by ftp.

Yup, Those with suPHP installed wont have to use FTP in the end. Right now FTP is forced to make people test it more :P

I found the dreamhost issue, Its not a dreamhost issue specifically, Rather that the code assumed the FTP session would allow access to /home/user/, Some ftp setups, such as Dreamhost, have the ftp session jailed into /home/user, So /home/user/ appears as / ('eh.. Its getting late, sorry if thats not making sense?)

are about 100 times more likely to have this problem than normal users
because at some point someone posted to the list encouraging people to
add index.php to their plugin folders, and only like a month later did
someone else realize it caused this bug.

The bug is very annoying and ruined my day when I was trying to fix
it, but I don't think it's as global a problem as it might seem to us
who read the list ;)

There's already a bug report on this in Trac:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3089

All that's really needed is (a) a way to get the plugin description 
into the POT/PO/MO files, and then (b) a modification of the code in 
WP that displays descriptions, to run it through gettext using the 
appropriate catalog name. There are already suggestions/patches for 
(b) in that Trac report.

The problem is (a), in my opinion. Getting plugin authors to use a new 
internationalization tool to add the description to their POT file 
will be a problem... many don't even bother to internationalize their 
plugins at in the first place, and others use some non-gettext scheme 
they thought of themselves...

Message-ID: <cd1a57e60803040815l51f1854bv7422e741127bf4ca@mail.gmail.com>

I'm sorry if this has been discussed before,

but I feel that the "postbox" divs on the post editor(categories, optional
excerpt, etc) have under 5% of their width to be clickable, while making the
whole div clickable might really increase their usability.

Essentially, when the option to expand the box is on the left hand corner
and is so small, it might make it difficult to open that box(not extremely
difficult, but inconvinient nevertheless), since it is handled by jquery.
Atleast now, unlike wp 2.3, it won't be used for dragging and dropping and
rearranging the post boxes.

Thanks

Well, if the theme is not internationalised, is it really a huge
problem that the metadata is not? If it *is* internationalised, I'd
expect the authors (and the users) will see "metadata not
internationalised" as a real bug and will tend to adopt the new way.

Hmm... I don't know PHP intimately, but if we can put PHP code in
specially-tagged comments, easily parse it and run it, we avoid the
"directory and extra metadata php file" problem.

Well, for those that don't internationalise it at all, it doesn't seem
shocking to me that the description of the plugin is not translated.

For the ones that do internationalise, the discussion in the bug and
the ML threads that it references seems to contain the ideas I was
having about that; thanks for the pointer. The discussion seems to
have several good ideas in competition.

I feel that having a system to allow plugin authors translating the
description is better. Can we have a system like this:

Plugin Name: Name Of The Plugin
Plugin URI: http://URI_Of_Page_Describing_Plugin_and_Updates
Description: A brief description of the plugin.
Version: The plugin's Version Number, e.g.: 1.0
Author: Name Of The Plugin Author
Author URI: http://URI_Of_The_Plugin_Author
Description-de: Description in german
Description-fr: Description in french
...

Several issues I can see with that idea:

* The plugin author is not probably fluent in all the world's 
languages. PO files allow translators to work separately from the 
plugin author, and not have to modify the plugin file.

* There are now two places for text translations to go (most go in PO 
file, only the description is in the plugin file).

* The plugin header could get pretty long if all world languages were 
included, not to mention different locales for some languages (e.g. 
Traditional and Simplified Chinese).

okay then how about this:
A seperate description text file for each language, in a seperate directory,
or along with the .po files. All it's gonna be is desc-fr.txt or
desc-it.txtand wordpress can detect this along with the appropriate
textdomain and
install them. This way the issues with size and translation are solved.

Also the major problem with adding them in the PO file is that the
localization file is loaded only when the plugin is activated or
load_plugin_textdomain is called

Yes, we can! Here's code. Run the get-metadata script with
/path/to/other/attached/file/foo as first command-line argument for an
example.

the idea was to avoid creating several files (there was an older 
proposal to add a file called metadata.php which would contain, well, 
the metadata, so wordpress would not need to load the whole plugin for 
that); some people seem to have the strange habit of putting all their 
plugin data and the kitchen sink into one file (php, html, javascript, I 
have yet to see base64-encoded images, but I wouldn't be very surprised 
to see it one day).

I, for one, am for something like:

can has metadata.php?
    yarly
        include metadata.php
    nowai
        parse teh plugin teh old way
    kthx

since a separate file would be overkill for small plugins

that's why metadata.php is a better idea: it could also 
load_plugin_textdomain if needed ;o)

actually, xgettext is smart enough to know what a PHP variable looks like:

iacobs@moria ~/tmp $ cat t.php
<?php
/*
 * Desc: __('awerwrtg')
 * Mumu: __('sdfgreyt')
 */
$tst = 'mumu';
echo __('asdfdfgsd');
echo __($tst);

?>
iacobs@moria ~/tmp $ xgettext -L PHP --keyword=__ -o - t.php

however, in order to avoid looking up the same string several times, we 
would need to add a noop function like _n($x){return $x;} to mark 
strings as translatable.

now, if the wordpress pot file is not generated by xgettext, things may 
get a bit more complicated :)

I'm attaching a diff of what I've had in mind. Essentially changed the
clickable area to the entire postbox div, which made a considerable bit of
difference.

Try it yourself changing line 3 of /wp-admin/js/postbox.js to:
jQuery('.postbox').click( function() {
jQuery(jQuery(this).get(0)).toggleClass('closed');
save_postboxes_state(page); } );

Seems to work pretty well.

You're talking about sites that are primarily focused on reading and
consuming, though. I believe it's more natural for a software
interface -- creating and managing content --  to be fully-fluid. The
new Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, and Google Groups, which I'm writing in right
now are all good examples.

Well, I think this part of the discussion has been beaten to death (quite
literally actually).

1. There is already a solution to the problem in Trac, which was create by
Jennifer and me. I think it is quite excellent, but why don't you test it
to see?

2. The solution hasn't been accepted, because one that hasn't been created
yet (although, honestly Ryan or a member of the core team or community
member might have already started on it) was just that.

The central argument is whether to include the current solution, which
works and then obsolete it when the proposed better one comes along or not
include the finished solution and wait until the proposed solution is
created, tested, has test cases, and is included in core.

Unless you have thoughts on either the first point, or the second, then I
think we'll go around in cycles beating the same issue to death once
again.

You will find that both solutions are excellent (well, the first is in my
opinion and I also love the second).

I think that unless you have solutions to the metadata, the one that is
proposed, that the discussion is rather pointless.

I would rather see input on how the other issues that haven't already been
beaten to death or solved. I think it is rather interesting to see what
people come up with. I've yet to fully read the entire proposal for i18n,
but I'll probably get around to it tonight.

Can you list the steps in more detail?

I plan on SVN UP myself and I don't want my blog to crash and burn. The
changes doesn't look that big to have caused this issue. I'll have to look
over the changes in more detail.

I cant reproduce after a SVN up either.

I doubt it'll burn at all Jacob, Worst case scenario is the plugin updator functionality wouldnt work(as spencerp seems to suggest happened).

All the steps I've taken, are the same as before that I sent through 
here before... I just did the SVN UP with those "fixes" first, then did 
the steps I've done before...

a) No folder chmodding at all, I purposely downloaded Contact Form 7 
version "1.6" knowing there was a later version for it. Immediately was 
shown there was an update available. (This without activating the plugin 
too.) ### Actually, last time I had folders chmod 777, but put it back 
to 755 chmod again. On Root, wp-content, and the plugins folder ###

b) Clicked the "update automatically" link.

c) Filled in the fields for the FTP informations...

d) Hit the button, then got the blog 404. Instead of that error message 
that I had when first trying..

I think I know what's going on here... All my domains are on my main 
"spencerp.net" account. When I FTP in, I'm FTP-ing to ftp.spencerp.net 
host with main account user and password. Once I'm IN then, I see ALL of 
my domains listed there... as their names of the domains are folders...

vindictivebastard.net/
public_html/
so on so forth...

So really, I'd almost have to connect to VB with it's OWN FTP host name, 
user and password right? But, that will screw up everything, and I'd 
have to re-add all the files and such like I'm starting fresh again... 
Just would have to use the VB wp-config.php file and .htaccess file 
after I changed up the account FTP stuff or whatever...

Gmail and Google Groups follow method (2).  They use a fluid layout but
ensure that line lengths remain reasonable via means like fixed-width
containers.

Yahoo! Mail doesn't, and accordingly suffers on wide screens for emails that
aren't hard-wrapped.  Studies on optimum line lengths go back to the late
1800s, so the Yahooligans don't have much of an excuse.

Just to be clear, I like fluid layouts.  There are lots of good examples of
fluid layouts that keep readability sane.

Subject: [wp-hackers] get_posts problem...
Message-ID: <47CDF3CB.5070705@gmail.com>

Maybe someone on here can help, well, hopefully. I'm on TRUNK 2.5 of 
course, and I have a theme where I'm using this code ABOVE the actual 
index.php loop stuff...

<div style="float: left; width: 30%; padding-top:15px; 
padding-left:15px;" class="footitems">
 <h4>latest<span class="altcolor"> posts</span></h4>
<?php
$posts = get_posts('numberposts=10&offset=0');
foreach ($posts as $post) : ?>
<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" title="<?php the_title() 
?>"><?php the_title() ?></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
 </div>

Now, it shows the Latest post titles in that section like supposed too, 
but when on the AUTHOR PAGE, it shows a POST and not THAT specific 
PAGE'S content. Is there a work around for this maybe? Jeremy Visser and 
I had tried this too...

<?php $latest_posts = get_posts('numberposts=3&offset=0');
foreach ($latest_posts as $latest_post) : ?>

It shows the AUTHOR page content, but in the top section it's showing 
three links "The Authors" which links to the actual "The Authors" page. 
It's not showing the latest posts titles... Anyone with a suggestion?

I later realised that won't work, because it's still using
the_permalink() and the_title() later on.

We need to do some query_posts() mojo.

Like maybe

<?php

global $wp_query, $wp_old_query;
$wp_old_query = $wp_query;

query_posts('numberposts=10&offset=0');

?while ( have_posts() ) :
the_post();

?>
<li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" title="<?php the_title() ?>"><?php the_title() ?></a></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<?php

endwhile;
$wp_query = $wp_old_query;

?>

Just tried that, and gives me following error:

Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '?' in C:\Program 
Files\xampp\htdocs\wp-content\themes\TheVindictiveBastardTheme1\header.php 
on line 55

I'm not a coder professional so... not sure about all this hacking code 
stuff LOL!

For the "the_title()" calls in the list, you need to add a semi-colon, to
make it "the_title();".  I think that should fix it.

Sorry, that was a bad copy/paste deal. Some how the "?" got put in front 
of the "<?php" and "while" in the code. =/ I removed the two ? and still 
no go...

No go as in still a parsing error about a "?" or no go as in that method
didn't work?

It's actually legal. The last semicolon before a ?> is not required.

The method(s) not working. We're trying various things, here I'll tell 
you what we're doing and the results...

method 1:

<h4>latest<span class="altcolor"> posts</span></h4>
        <?php
$posts = get_posts('numberposts=10&offset=0');
foreach ($posts as $post) : ?>
<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" title="<?php the_title(); 
?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<?php endforeach; ?>

Result: Shows the Latest Posts titles in top section like they supposed 
too, but there's still a normal POST on the Authors page... and not the 
Author page content...

Method 2:

<h4> latest <span class="altcolor">posts</span></h4>
<?php
global $wp_query, $wp_old_query;
$wp_old_query = $wp_query;
query_posts('numberposts=3&offset=0');
while ( have_posts() ) :
the_post();
?>
<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" title="<?php the_title(); 
?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<?php
$wp_query = $wp_old_query;
endwhile;
$wp_query = $wp_old_query;
?>

Result: Shows the Latest TWO post titles in above section, and TWO posts 
in the author page, instead of one as we had in first Method. No Author 
Page content showing at all...

I could be mistaken, but it seems a bit odd to have "$wp_query =
$wp_old_query;" twice.  I believe the first one should be removed?

Note: I've been debugging an assembly language program (for decryption of a
transposition cipher) for the past two hours (it's still an ongoing process
and will probably last another 2-4), so my brain might just be a bit too
fried for its own good and you should take anything I say with a grain of
salt.

I'm not sure about that code, Jeremy did that stuff. I did however 
remove the FIRST line of it, and tried it, and it gave same result... 
Two latest post titles at top section and two normal posts in Author 
page itself... No errors...

Oh, Wait, I might've understood it wrongly, Are you saying it deleted *ALL* the wordpress files?

If thats the case, Then something in the get_base_dir() function must be borked on your setup.

So, Your folder structure is as:
ABSPATH = /home/user/...../vindictivebastard.net/public_html/wordpress/..
And when you login via FTP its locked to
/vindictivebastard.net/public_html/wordpress/.. ?
Or is it locked to a different directory?

Sorry about that, I guess theres a reason it should be only run in testing environments still.. 

Later this evening i'll write up a plugin that simulates a plugin upgrade but doesnt change the files, see if that turns up whats going wrong?

Sorry forgot, we tried ANOTHER method as well...

Method 3:

<h4> latest <span class="altcolor">posts</span></h4>
<?php $latest_posts = get_posts('numberposts=3&offset=0');
foreach ($latest_posts as $latest_post) : ?>
<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" title="<?php the_title(); 
?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<?php endforeach; ?>

Result: It showed the Author Page content just fine, however, it showed 
the "The Authors" page links THREE times in the above section where the 
actual Latest Posts titles are supposed to be at. Basically it showed 
the page's links 3 times instead of latest three post's titles...

I actually meant for him to make the first occurance before endwhile to
be this:

global $wp_query, $wp_old_query;

I think he misinterpreted me.

I can confirm Spencerp's report as I have also done as Spencerp's steps.

This is the link I'm redirected to (and yes, I do know this is a live 
system):

http://www.santosj.name/wp-admin/update.php?action=upgrade-plugin&plugin=altmailer/alt-mailer.php

Is the 404. It is interesting, very interesting. So update.php exists of 
course. However, something is causing the 404 error. It might be 
unrelated to any change dealing with the wp-filesystem. To confirm that, 
would have to do something else that handles actions and as such.

As an aside, since this deals with testing, any vote on moving any 
further account to wp-testing mailing list? There might be others other 
there having similar problems.

I'm not sure about anything being locked up like that, but I'm 
guessing... that might be the case though. Because when I was entering 
my FTP informations for updating that plugin via the "update 
automatically (file system)" option... it gives me blog 404.

See, when I added MORE domains on my main dreamhost acct. 
"spencerp.net", I didn't assign each single NEW domain an FTP account. I 
just slapped the domains on main account, and access ALL of them via the 
ONE MAIN account one for "spencerp.net" ....

So if I go under manage > vindictivebastard.net, give it's OWN FTP 
account, it will automatically give an empty directory... even though I 
can access the normal original one through the ftp.spencerp.net host... 
if I connect to ftp.vindictivebastard.net with it's OWN one... once 
logged in there... it will be empty directories..

So I'd have to manually upload the WP files again to the "empty" VB FTP 
directory account one, re-upload the original VB wp-config.php and 
.htaccess files... and do it that way... which other downfall is, I 
won't be able to use SVN on that... because when logged in through the 
"plink spencerp.net" CMD method... I'm connecting through "spencerp.net" 
account.. and not a vindictivebastard.net account...

And I never figured out HOW-TO have TWO setup for doing SVN / Putty  on 
my Computer... So in short, if I add an FTP account to VB... I'd 
basically be running without SVN and manually have to upload all the 2.5 
files again using my FTP client... because Dreamhost considers it (VB) 
as being it's OWN domain account..

I think it's like this currently:
/home/my-main-account-username/vindictivebastard.net

Being that it was just added to main account "spencerp.net" But, if I 
wanted to give it's OWN FTP account, I'd have to create NEW user... 
which makes it like: /home/NEW-account-username/vindictivebastard.net
Which it would READ IT AS, an empty directory. Because all the files are 
originally under:
/home/my-main-account-username/vindictivebastard.net

Doing this: /home/NEW-account-username/vindictivebastard.net Will be 
like, setting up it's OWN domain FTP account, basically starting on 
empty fresh directory location / install location. I'd have to connect 
to that NEW one via a normal FTP client... upload the WP 2.5 files 
manually... and original VB config/.htaccess files, then provide in the 
"update automatically" fields.. the NEW VB FTP informations.. I know 
this is a huge explanation.. but Dreamhost is complicated.. .LMAO! Or, 
perhaps I'm making things more complicated then need be... I dunno..

No, I copied the code from our GTalk directly ...

Jeremy: this is my code:
?<?php

global $wp_query, $wp_old_query;
$wp_old_query = $wp_query;

query_posts('numberposts=10&offset=0');

?while ( have_posts() ) :
the_post();

?>

Spencer: <?php

endwhile;
$wp_query = $wp_old_query;

?>
where in there?


Jeremy: after the <?php


Spencer: its already there
u put it there in the email of urs
this
<?php

endwhile;
$wp_query = $wp_old_query;

?>


Jeremy: <?php

global $wp_query, $wp_old_query;
endwhile;
$wp_query = $wp_old_query;

?>

Spencer: nope still no go
show two posts in author page instead of one..

I did try that last suggestion... still didn't work.. =(

I thought Dan was talking about this part of this code..

global $wp_query, $wp_old_query;
$wp_old_query = $wp_query;


<?php

global $wp_query, $wp_old_query;
$wp_old_query = $wp_query;

query_posts('numberposts=10&offset=0');

?while ( have_posts() ) :
the_post();

?>

I removed the FIRST line: global $wp_query, $wp_old_query; and tried 
that like this..

<?php

$wp_old_query = $wp_query;

query_posts('numberposts=10&offset=0');

?while ( have_posts() ) :
the_post();

?>

Did same thing as before too...

Just thought I'd add my $.02.  Make it fluid and let the user adjust 
accordingly.  That's how most applications work (websites aside), seems 
most logical, and is what I prefer (this may not carry much weight, but 
it is *my* $.02 right?).

I'm not sure if that last stuff I wrote through here makes any sense to 
you guys/gals... but, I was just ASSUMING... that maybe the "update 
automatically" wasn't working because I was trying to update the plugin 
on my VB domain, connecting with the ftp.spencerp.net FTP account 
credentials and that updating plugins via VB's backend wouldn't work 
with the FTP stuff... unless I had VB connecting to it's OWN FTP 
credentials.. But, I dunno..

Basically what Mr. Awesome is saying (dude! Wicked sweet name), is that 
if you create a FTP user, you can add as many domains to that user as 
you like. However they will all sign in with the same username. To 
provide more security when more than one user is accessing that FTP, you 
can create a new FTP user, but it will then create a new directory 
structure and not copy the old one. You have to do that manually after 
you move the domain to the new user.

However, you can basically access any domain using the FTP before that 
domain and it will point to that user.

So lets say, I have santosj.name on one user and somedomain.com on that 
same user. I can access the same directory structure using:

ftp.santosj.name or ftp.somedomain.com. Which will both point to 
/home/santos/ directory.

Yeah, the FastCGI checkbox doesn't actually do anything. Although, if 
you are running PHP5, then you should follow the steps in the codex in 
order to enable it, because you're running PHP in CGI mode instead. 
FastCGI just tells Dreamhost how many people (think they) are using FastCGI.

Basically, yes. I can connect to ALL my domains with this file-system... 
through the MAIN "spencerp.net" account FTP informations.. so if I go 
onto another domain, did the "update automatically (File-system) 
stuff... I could just enter my MAIN "spencerp.net" FTP informations.. 
and it'd connect.. because THAT domain is ALSO under the "spencerp.net" 
MAIN account...

So, I could be in admin/ panel for say "my-domain-number4", go to 
plugins section, click "update automatically" link, fill in FTP HOST, 
FTP USER, FTP PASS that I normally use on main account "spencerp.net" 
and it SHOULD WORK just fine.. I did it on VB and it works... I was just 
ASSUMING before, with the new "FIX COMMIT", that it would require each 
domain to have it's OWN FTP account / access stuff.. but it don't.

I'd reply to this, but my brain is SO confused as is, with all these

Thanks for confirming this Jacob. It's good to know I'm not alone at 
"seeing" this issue. =) Perhaps looking back through the last handful of 
SVN commits once, might help pinpoint a cause of the 404?

Yeah I agree, this should be taken to wp-testers list now. Since it's 
regarding the TRUNK and new feature, which of course is still in testing 
mode...

You're incorrect. GMail is full width -- no fixed width containers except
the sidebar and that doesn't count.

site does it... Let's just focus on making this new admin redesign loved

I even removed that

<?php
$posts = get_posts('numberposts=10&offset=0');
foreach ($posts as $post) : ?>

code from the header.php file, and put it in the sidebar.php file.. and 
I still get a normal post on the Author page, and not the actual Author 
content material... Grrr.. I know why though.. cause the sidebar "call" 
is BEFORE the index page loop stuff.. so it's basically still AHEAD of 
the "loop" which is still letting it happen...

<?php get_header(); ?>

<div id="contentwrap" class="clearfix">
   
    <?php get_sidebar(); ?>
   
    <div id="left">
       
        <h3 class="pen">content articles</h3>
        <small>Integer id metus eget ligula commodo dictum.</small>
       
        <?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

Hmm, maybe if I relocate where the sidebar "call" code is, like.. after 
the "loop" before the "get_footer" it will be ok... Hmmm.. But there 
still should be some type of "work-around/ fix" for this though... sigh.

I did that, and it works. Now I just gotta restyle the Sidebar CSS stuff 
... It's currently sitting UNDER the post/ page content... rather than 
beside it.. of course!

Right, that's why I used the phrase "means like" after I'd inspected the
HTML.  I don't know what Gmail is doing specifically, but the email in my
inbox is wrapped properly.  Maybe it's magic and only works for me?

Anyway, it's been known for a hundred years that text blocks meant for
reading can't be too long without impacting humans' ability to read them.
You certainly won't find anyone advocating 22" wide text fields.

This is my modest attempt to educate whoever's listening about usability.
I'm not interested in a debate, so let's be lazy about it and move on.

I disagree -- I, and I think many others here, want _exactly_ that. I have a
19" CRT monitor at 1600x1200 resolution for a reason. If I didn't want it

+1. I have a 22" monitor (at 1680x1050), and I'd like to be able to use all
of it if I want to (and I do want to).

I really don't see why this is becoming such a big deal. Don't set a
max-width, and if people on larger monitors (or resolutions) want the width
to be smaller, then they can use that nifty little feature, available in all
modern operating systems, to resize their browser window. Simple as that.

Yes, it may be proven that most people prefer to read/type on a certain
sized textbox, but why should WordPress be "advocating" this? Usability? No,
because most people use larger monitors for *greater usability*.

Note: Generic reply to those posted above, Not directly relational to the parent of *this* post.

Allright, I'm glad to hear spencerp that it didnt do a mass-delete of files.. I got a bit worried there, Awhile back with some testing code i managed to wipe half my dev server when i forgot to comment out the delete command, Luckely it was on a static virtual machine, so it was only a reboot away.

re: Admin 404'ing, Thats not something I'm seeing on any install i've got access to, But it certainly sounds like something else.. not directly related to the change.. no idea what though
http://www.santosj.name/wp-admin/update.php?action=upgrade-plugin&plugin=altmailer/alt-mailer.php = I dont know why that'd be 404'ing, It redirects me to a login prompt, so it obviously realises its an admin page, and that i dont have access..

While testing with Dreamhost, I kept coming accross Stale NFS IO errors.. I'd try ftp'ing in, deleteing the update.php file, and doing another svn up, just so that the filesystem realises its updated maybe.. its just a pure guess..

I'm going to spend the next few hours writing up a simple plugin which spews out debug information for wp-filesystem, just so that those with problems can report back what its complaining about(Or what its *not* complaining about -- just as bad IMO :P)

I've not had that much experience with mainline webhosts, so quite a few of the setups are new to me, And its been awhile since i wrote the ftp-root-finding code.

There is a problem with having text go extremely wide.

If you observe gmail, though the mail writing field is large and wide, all
your messages have a fixed width as far as gmail shows it. The reason is
when you're reading along line, you're prone to skip lines or not remember
where you left off.

Suppose line n was very long and the text is itself extremely long, Then at
the end of line n, you might skip to line n+1 or there is a good probability
you might skip to line (n+2). The human mind works that way. Just this that
if the text is very wide, you might have difficulties reading large pieces
of text. Don't take my word for it, try opening up a project gutenburg or a
large text in notepad and maximize it. See how far you'll read before you
start getting annoyed with the width.

I'll try finding a proper usability article either from Jakob Neilsen or
someone.

But the fact is, after a width of around 1000 px, it starts to get a little
difficult to work around with.

the patch looks fine, but doesn't address adding the metadata to the pot 
files; this is not so much a wordpress concern, though, since plugin 
authors would need to do it :D

providing a script that would extract the info would be nice; I can 
provide what I am using for https://launchpad.net/gscrobbler/ (atm it is 
a setuptools extension, but it can go easily in a standalone script), 
however people might resist adding non-php code to the code base (you 
can shoot me and I won't do shell scripts in php :P)

well, until I see some code I can't say much about the second choice 
(the one with metadata written in php), it should be rather easy to add 
later and not break the old stuff.

well, I see that it's been moved to 2.6; maybe it could go in 
2.5.something after some testing and if it's complete, and some other 
eyes took a look at it.

For instance
 * I am not sure why you need to call translate instead of __() 
(xgettext can recognise php variables and won't pollute the core text 
domain)
 * I am also unsure of why plugin_get_contents doesn't just grab the 
first multiline comment, instead of blindly reading 512 more bytes "just 
to be sure"
 * (unrelated to your patch) we should have a standard structure for 
distributing mo files; I am totally against just throwing them in 
wp-content/plugins or in the plugin dir, I figure it would be best to 
use wp-content/plugins/pluginname/locale/ll_CC.mo

I'll apply the patch and see what I can come up with if I get some spare 
time.

where is that? is there a list of issues somewhere? if you mean the OP 
of this thread, it just reinvents the wheel and makes it square :)

one problem I remember hitting was that admin page hooks, for instance, 
used to be computed from the translated strings, so 
"options_page_inline_gallery" became "einstellungen_page_inline_gallery" 
in German, but something seems to have changed in there, I didn't get to 
look at the source yet (one should translate as late as possible, 
preferably right before displaying, anyway).

IMHO the best and probably easiest way to do this is by standardizing 
the way plugins are written for WordPress:

1. Each plugin should be in a sub-directory of /wp-content/plugins. That 
way the plugins directory will be better organized and new users won't 
make the mistake of putting a plugin in the wrong sub-folder. I know 
there are many plugins that are installed directly in 
/wp-content/plugins, but what's wrong with putting them in a sub-dir if 
that would benefit new users? Also lots of plugins already follow this.

2. Each plugin should contain a directory named "languages" or similar 
with .pot and .mo files in it. The names of these files should be 
[plugin-name]_[locale].pot/mo and the first few lines of the .pot would 
be the plugin's meta. We can even provide a template for the .pot.

It would be very easy to scan all .mo files when WordPress loads the 
plugin page and display the relevant language if it exists, or default 
to English if it doesn't. The average size of a plugin's .mo is just a 
few KB, so even if there are 40-50 plugins it won't take much memory or 
make the plugins page noticeable slower.

Of course all this won't happen overnight, and the current display of 
plugin's meta would have to be supported for a while, or perhaps we can 
keep it as a default in case the plugin is not translated, but the 
sooner something like this is implemented, the better.

http://dd32.id.au/files/wp-filesystem-tester.zip

Take note of any differences between "FS WordPress Locator" and "FS2 WordPress Locator", #1 is whats included in WP atm, #2 is a few changes i've been making(Mainly Windows-server fixes)

If anyone is having issues, Activate that plugin, head over to its tab, Send me all the cruft it produces(off-list reply appreciated), and i might be able to work out whats causing the problem(At present, it only deals with connecting/locating wordpress, and creating/deleteing files,  Need to add Zip error checking, permission checks and whatnot)

Sorry, but you're incorrect. All of my non-plain text e-mails are full width
(and I prefer it that way). wp-hackers, etc. all just add line breaks at X
characters which is why you're mistaken.

If I wanted to scroll a lot, I'd run a lower resolution.

I've run this resolution and read text like that for many, many years. I
love it.

Then don't run a wide resolution...

(I'm not trying to be an ass BTW, just saying it comes down to personal
choice and tastes and out of the box, WordPress is forcing it's upon me.)

For plain text e-mail it may also be due to RFC 2822 for e-mail which   
says "thou should not have lines longer than 78 characters."

That is correct.  There is a reason newspapers write in narrow columns.

The distinction here is probably that people with big monitors bump up  
their fonts a bit bigger than 12pt.  I generally have my defaults at  
about 16pt, and sometimes go bigger.  That makes a difference if the  
width of the column is restricted by pixel count.

I would again suggest a max-width determined in em or %.  Think of it  
as adjusting for inflation. ;)

(Actually, I've [rarely] seen sites where _everything_ was defined  
this way.  The effect was very cool -- enlarging the text size scaled  
up the entire page, just like zooming in.  Only really works that way  
with _very_ limited graphics, though.)

Fully scalable web sites are not quite there yet mostly due to  
unscalable images, but em and percentages have come a long way for  
doing this.

Another method here could be to use jquery and the dimensions plugin,  
but that adds more work. I've been playing with this technique for my  
personal site to arrange sidebars based on window width. Things move  
without rewrapping text as the window size increases above 1000 ( http://funroe.net 
  ) this is only an experiment, so not perfect by any means.

It could be considered overkill for the Dashboard though and something  
like that should degrade nicely if implemented.

True. The plugin author would need to have a function, which does 
nothing that also has the metadata using __() somewhere. This will add 
the metadata to the pot file and will loaded with translate.

As long as it is Python and not Ruby, then I have no quarrels. I should 
point out, that not everyone is on a host (although hosts are being 
"cool" by including both more) which has Python and Ruby. Godaddy? Nope. 
I would have one in PHP just to be sure, but default to the Python in 
the case they do have it.

Yeah, that is exactly what I said at the time. The discussion link is in 
the ticket at the bottom. It happened in January and February and is 
about the metadata thread. It is a massive thread, so you shouldn't be 
able to miss it.

It isn't going to make it in to 2.5, because even if you test it, they 
still can't add it, because they need more people using and testing it 
than just three people. It is too close to 2.5 to add at this point. 
That is partially why I'm sour about the issue. If it was added back in 
January or February before the feature freeze, then it could have been 
more formally tested and accepted as stable when 2.5 came out.

The only code that will be accepted is the second proposal, which has no 
current code and may skip 2.6 and be moved to 2.7, unless someone writes 
the code. If no one else does, then I may get around to it for 2.7, but 
that is two point versions, which a solution existed previously and was 
not accepted. Oh well. You lose some, you gain some, but I'm still not 
happy about the situation. I suppose that by the time 2.6 comes out that 
I'll come to my senses about the issue and try to implement the proposal 
(if no one else has at that point, three months? A lot can happen, if 
more i18n people want a solution).

Some other gettext parsers will in fact parse the PHP variables and 
also, the __() will pollute the WordPress .pot file with variables. It 
was changed to translate to prevent those, but still allow for using 
variables to get the metadata.

Well, I mean there are a lot of "what if"s in plugin_get_contents. The 
padding isn't really needed, but it would be completely painful 
debugging experience for plugin authors if part of the description was 
cut off. The reason the first multiline comment is not grabbed is that 
there is no way to do that without either pulling even more than the 
1.5kB or pulling some random number and checking to see if the "*/ 
exists. In some extreme cases. The multi-line comment is massive with 
the required information half way. While, in most cases, it will still 
be less than the full file and therefore not cause any memory 
exhaustion, I still would have the padding, even if it is totally hackish.

The plugin author can put the .mo file in any directory they want. It 
just defaults to the folder the plugin is in. I also think the common 
theme is to not take away the flexibility of the plugin developer. Some 
plugin developers are professionals and are probably already doing it 
that way. However, at best, I think you should inform and get the word 
out about your recommendations.

Add it to the codex, I mean. "This is what you do to add translatable 
code and here are some recommendations to doing it right." I have to 
admit this topic is something that I didn't understand myself and if 
this resource was available, it would have helped me do it right, the 
first time.

That would be helpful, but it is unlikely that the patch will be 
accepted, even with more testers. I forgot to mention, but the core team 
will not accept anything other than the second proposal (or something in 
lines with the second proposal that is better). Thank you, but it 
wouldn't help change their minds about the issue. I've already debated 
the issue every which way I can think of. I'll be happy, if you can 
provide the needed endorsement, but the patch was DOA and is unlikely to 
be revived.

I actually think the only issue that wasn't covered or fixed was the /* 
I18N_START */ stuff /* I18N_END */ proposal. However, from what I can 
interpret of that, is that it has already been created as a tool.

I'm actually not that very good at the whole Localization and 
Internationalization. However, I would love to get my hands dirty and 
there is one guy in mind that is very good at the stuff. I suppose the 
problem is getting it down into words, so that someone who wants to make 
a patch is able to fully meet your requirements.

This would be great on a Codex Page! Make sure to add a link from the 
main Plugin Development page, so that people can find it. Also, a good 
post like this will most likely be lost, so make sure to post back with 
a link to the codex page.

It should be pointed out that the theme .mo files are hard coded to 
exist in a specific folder, while the plugin .mo files can be anywhere. 
I think that the theme one can be fixed, but I don't think the plugin 
one needs to be.

To be fair, my personal preference is to run my browser maximized on my
1920x1200 monitor and to NOT have my text be that incredibly long.  If we
switched to a fully fluid layout WP would be forcing full-width on me.  You
can't easily match everyone's preferences.  They way it is right now, WP is
going for general usability rather than niche specifications.  Those who
feel that strongly about having it their way will be willing to add a
plug-in or whatever to fix it.

Respectfully, Viper, I think the gist of this conversation is that  
_you_ are the exception to the rule.  The vast majority of humans have  
difficulty reading very long lines of text.  (Unless it's only one  
line, in which case there's no problem with confusing which line  
you're on!)

You're right, it _is_ personal preference, however the guideline with  
WP tends to be "make it work for most, and everyone else can use  
plugins".  So... a simple "make this full width" plugin, and/or the  
previously suggested "max width" alternate stylesheet.

The alternate stylesheet is the most elegant solution, as it is  
invisible to people who don't need it.  (Which is most.)

Why can't we have JS and cookie for the same so depending on choise
people will choise it . Be fluid or fixed ?
I am not an expert but belive that is not very hard to add as lot of
WP theme has them.

My 2 cents

Cheers

Given how varying the reactions are to the new interface (and it's not
even released yet), it's inevitable that there's going to be a lot of
plugins to correct or change design elements. The question is, it
seems to me, does it make sense to anticipate the most common UI
requests and add an 'interface' tab in the settings area for the user.
As it stands now, the admin interface is the only major user-facing
element of WP that there's no way to customize without additional
code.

Yes about the 98% of web user i suppose. The idea to have something
like a visual editor large than screen resolution it's quite funny.
It's true that RTE is not really a WYSYWYG editor but sometime i
though that the correct width for that text area should be the width
of the content area in the current used theme whith a top walue for
that full fluid theme (that i hate), this would be a really help
wrintig post cause u can see if an image it's to wide or the text flow
areound it will rend with 4 chars per line etc. Unfortunatly the
render area of a post in a heme has not a predefined class or id so
would be hard to implement.

I completely agree. However, instead of an alternate stylesheet, what I
would do is the following:

1. Check to see if the user has a large screen size using the jQuery
Dimensions plugin (when minimized 'only about 2k') [1]. So for example, if
screensize is 'X' big, we print "widescreen"

2. If the dimensions count as wide, small, medium, or whatever we choose
according to the jQuery Dimensions results, we give the <body> tag a
specific classname, eg. <body class="widescreen">

3. The main wp-admin.css stylesheet will have different styles according to
that body.widescreen class. This is good because we aren't making another
HTTP request for a different stylesheet entirely, just exceptions for
widescreen sizes.

This is completely transparent for users, means that it changes according to
whatever screen your using (I take back my comment on making it a saved
option, as people access their admin panels from varying sizes of screen).

The overall effect of this is a better experience for varying sizes of
screen, and only 'around 2k' of extra load.

This sounds good. Would it also change style when the window is resized 
and work flawlessly in all browsers?

If this is not done, IMHO we should change the max-width to using em's, 
so on large monitors where the user has set larger font sizes it would 
still look right.

I would put it in the codex, but it's still just a proposal.

Currently all plugins hosted on wordpress.org are required to have
readme.txt, following specific formatting and are wrapped in a folder
with the plugin's name when downloaded.

It shouldn't be hard to auto-make a sub-directory named "languages" if
it doesn't exist and add an empty .pot template named
[plugin_name]_en.pot to it. The .pot would contain the meta strings,
allowing them to be translated. It could even fill it with the current
plugin's meta the same way it displays it on Extend - Plugins. I'll ask
Mike about this.

I was planning to go through older tickets this evening, as there are
many that are fixed or invalidated by the changes in 2.5. But perhaps
should start on a patch implementing this and see how it goes.

well, you can try one of two things.

you can try to go to every arbitary website's
wp-conent/plugins/yourplugin.php file and see if it's around

Also you can allow your plugin to send a message back to your server(of
course you'll have to mention it in your privacy policy)

Unless we have some way of continually checking the dimensions via JS calls,
(which I'm guessing would be pretty labor intensive on the users experience,
ie. slowing it down), then we can only work off whatever their browser size
is when the page loads.

All javascript enabled browsers; but it would degrade gracefully without JS
enabled, those users just wouldn't get the 'full size' experience.

I believe you can hook into the javascript action onResize to be notified when the user changes the browser window size.

Assuming you've included either the Plugin URL or Author URL in your
plugin, you might want to check out your website's statistics and look
for any referrals from URLs like www.example.com/wp-admin/plugins.php
. I've found that often people who are using one of my plugin will
click the link to the plugin or author homepage from their Plugins
screen in WordPress. This will at least give you some sites which are
using your plugin.

So basically you're suggesting that we make it fixed narrow for  
smaller windows and fixed-wide for larger windows???

How does this complicated system have any advantage over simply making  
fluid -width?

I've found quite a lot of pages using my plugins through this method.   
If it's a well-liked plugin, some people will link to your page from  
their blogs, too.  Then check comments for people saying "Hey cool,  
I'll use that!" :)  In other words, surf your trackbacks and stats hits

DD32 and I were having offlist email conversations about the 
wp-filesystem-tester plugin and what was working or not working.. 
Basically, for me, some how there was another directory made within the 
directory... which I had to delete...

DD32 wrote: "I have a feeling thats being casused by the previous 
non-working code creating a folder called 
/home/.hostname/myuser/vindictivebastard.net/ in your home directory.
(ie. so a folder exists at 
/home/.hostname/home/.hostname/myuser/vindictivebastard.net/ )
Can you check if that folder exists, and if so, Delete it, and try again?"

Once I found it in the Dreamhosts.com WEBFTP panel, I deleted it and 
then tried FTP-ing via the filesystem way, and it worked. I changed the 
version of the Akismet plugin from 2.1.4 to 2.1.3... Clicked on "update 
autmatically" link, filled in FTP credentials and hit submit... Got this:

"Downloading update from http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/akismet.zip

Unpacking the update

Removing the old version of the plugin

Installing the latest version
Plugin upgraded successfully"

I then went to the plugins page to see if it WAS updated, and yep it was 
updated...

Evidently he was testing it on the wp-contact-form plugin, and He wrote: 
"It turned out to be the Blank files, wp-contact-form has several 0 byte 
files, Since the FTP server was returning absolutely nothing for the 
files, the wrapper was assuming that it meant there was no file there.. 
Which caused it to fail copying the plugin over."

He then added that patch:
http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/5586/5586.4.diff
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/7164

I did a SVN UP on the domains... and attempted updating that 
"contact-form-7" plugin 
(http://ideasilo.wordpress.com/2007/04/30/contact-form-7/), and then got 
this message below here....

Here, Have a go with the attached file.

When the patch is commited, it should just merge straight over and then be identical..

There is still a fair amount of testing going on, to the extent you 
could help it would be appreciated, especially with the new gallery, 
widgets, and the upgrader.

The number of tickets has nothing to do with how close we are to release.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Internationalizing Plugins and Themes Solutions
Message-ID: <47CFF09A.40208@santosj.name>

My main focus on the discussion is the plugin part, while ignoring the 
theme part. I think the central issue, is not which method is the best, 
but which one is the easiest. If someone finds adding comments to a PHP 
or CSS file to get the plugin or theme up and running, I don't think 
that the PHP method and the WP-Tools method will help the developer.

Of course, if you are going to make the WP translation tools part of the 
plugin/theme repository, then good for you. However, I for one will say 
that is quite unfair. It is unfair to those of us who tried to fix the 
issue with the current working method and it is unfair to those of us 
who would very much like the new method.

I think you could also use the phpDoc method:

/**
 * @plugin-name Something
 * @plugin-author Jacob Santos <wordpress at santosj dotname> 
http://www.example.com
 * @plugin-url http://wordpress.org/extend/plugin/
 * @plugin-description whatever
 */

I'm kidding of course.

What issue is with the metadata now?

Problem: You can't translate something in comments.
Solution: Either move the metadata out of the comments or allow what is 
in the comment to be translated.

Solution #1: Extend the current metadata comment to add a couple more 
properties to control translating and have a hack which forces __() 
usage in a function which does nothing.

Advantages: Uses current method, which is unlikely to be deprecated any 
time soon or at least will not be removed in any foreseeable future.

Disadvantages: Relies on a hack to get gettext solution to see 
translatable text.


Solution #2: Use Westi's proposal, to create function + optional file, 
which moves the metadata out of the PHP comment into a function which 
can be translated. This removes the comment metadata problem and the 
hack is no more. This is a more clean solution, than the first.

Advantages: Cleaner PHP code, removes untranslatable metadata comment, 
creates another file which if it exists will allow including that for 
just the metadata (and for other features if and when they are also added).

Disadvantages: Security precautions need to be made, but including the 
entire optional file may cause allow for malicious code to run without 
activating the plugin code. PHP code would have to be cut out of the 
file regardless of which file it is in and run through eval(). eval() 
might be disabled (for known security problems) on some hosts meaning 
that all plugins relying on this method will not work or run the risk of 
executing code which the user does not wish to run before activation.

Solution #3: Use WP based tool for translating the plugin metadata while 
in the comment and create a .pot file from that.

Advantages: Any plugin that is added to the WordPress Plugin Repository, 
will immediately have translated metadata for which any number of 
translators can upload translations for. Will also allow for users to 
download plugin in their language.
Disadvantages: While those Plugins on the WordPress Repository will be 
helped out a great deal, those that exist outside will not. The tool is 
not something that a novice will be able to wrap their mind around.

Creating a web interface will be an advantage, but getting the word out 
about the tool might not reach everyone. Also, they will still have to 
set up a system like what the WordPress Extend has anyway to support 
multiple languages. How many will do that?

-----------

I think Solution #3 is very cool for the WordPress extend. However, I 
have no idea where it is in that set of tools that you have what you 
propose. It is very clean code, but I can't see where it is taking the 
metadata and translating it. If the assumption was that it would be 
written, if more people liked the idea, then I'll have to say that for 
WordPress extend it would be cool.

So basically out of the three, only one has a finished solution. Out of 
the three, the second would work best for plugins, while the third would 
work best for themes unless you start checking for the register_theme() 
in the functions.php file. I think, that is a good solution for themes, 
but it would mean that every theme would have to have a functions.php 
file along with index.php and style.css (for backwards compatibility).

So one person pointed out the obvious, the old style isn't going away. I 
think that Solution #3 also has other disadvantages which would need to 
be applied to the code.

The first two are very quick and dirty methods requiring only gettext. 
What is fascinating about the first two, is that if someone was to code 
for both, it would allow for the first to work (if and only if the 
metadata was copied exactly). I think the problem then is checking every 
file for register_plugin() / register_theme() in order to see which file 
holds the function, extract that out, along with the 
load_plugin_textdomain() (if it exists) and run those both through 
eval(). I suppose, if metadata.php does exist and it only has those two 
in the file, that it can just be included and ran, but if it had any 
other arbitrary code, that it would have to be dismissed and run through 
eval().

I know for a fact, that a lot of the cheaper hosts disable eval() along 
with shell() and friends. If you wanted to do it securely, then you 
would have to only execute that code. The speed doesn't so much matter 
since it is only one page on the administration.

The point I'm trying to make is that sometimes, you don't want to have 
to use a tool you don't need or always have access to. I want to just 
code register_plugin() with the __(). Also, from what I interpreted of 
the February Nikolay post is that it would also depend on translating 
the English text and would only add the English to a .pot file, which 
would require the modifications in #1 anyway.

I'm willing to put forth the effort, hopefully if I can find time, this 
weekend to retest the #1 solution and implement the #2 solution. In 
which case, it would be either up in the air whether to support both 
solutions or to support one or the other. As well, both would answer the 
question of translating the metadata without the required use of an 3rd 
party tool.

Well, it would be much preferable to have their assent and
cooperation; after all we need them to apply the patch adding the
special comments, and to put the special comments around any new
hard-coded string in future. I also found it preferable to allow
everyone to comment, make suggestions, etc. (Maybe they don't like the
special comments I've chosen and would prefer something shorter, or on
the contrary, longer and more self-explanatory. Things like that.)

Up to now, I've been getting only positive comments, both on
wp-polyglots and wp-hackers, so it looks like it is going to happen
sooner or later.

Thanks. Do you know how to create and apply patches? If not, tell me,
I'll prepare ready-to-download tarballs. If yes, download
http://people.debian.org/~lmamane/wordpress/no-code-dup-i18n-poc-v2.patch,
and apply it to a svn trunk checkout, do the work described below and
send me the resulting patch.

The biggest work remaining is going through the sources and tag all
hard-coded strings (_not_ those already gettext-internationalised,
that is inside a call to a __() or _e() or ... !). By "tagging" a
string, I mean add the exact sequence of characters "/* WP_I18N_START
*/" (without the double quotes) before it and the exact sequence "/*
WP_I18N_END */" (without the double quotes) after it. You can put one
start/end pair around code that contains several strings, which are
all to be translated. See also the examples in my original message and
in my patch.

If a hard-coded string contains variable references, that is things
such as "$foo" or "{$foo}", it should be replaced by a sprintf
structure. For example,
 wp_die("Could not connect to DB host $host, I'm all confused now", 'Fatal error');
should become
 /* WP_I18N_START */ wp_die(sprintf("Could not connect to DB host %s, I'm all confused now", $host), 'Fatal error'); /* WP_I18N_END */


We should probably also tag things like upgrade download URLs, default
blogroll URLs in the default theme, etc, as some translation teams
have their own for that.


Could you do that? If nobody else does, I'll try to do it in the
week-end, but I won't be able to do it before.


Once the strings are tagged, MAKE A COPY OF THE SOURCES WITH THE TAGS
(but the strings still in the original English), and send me the
patch.


Then, run the "i18n-tools/generate-pot" script; it will output a .pot
file to stdout. Use it to produce a .po file, and from it a .mo file
as you usually do. Then, run the i18n-tools/translate-static script,
which will translate the tagged string. Check that they are all
translated and that the sources differ in no other way. If one of
these properties does not hold, it is a bug, please tell me about it.


The "translate-static" step is NOT (trivially) reversible, so make a
backup of the sources before you apply it!


If you have any question, let met know.

Cool, didn't know about this one.

Maybe there should be a link to this on wordpress.org/download, instead
of the nightly builds stuff (which WP doesn't release anyway).

i'm seeing two problems with this:
1. if a server has fsockopen disabled, it might not work
2. this way for translation, you're forcing them to use the codex.
3. might create undue stress on the codex servers(or I guess they can handle
it)

I believe that the most appropriate way will involve having all the
translators not edit one file.

I'd suggest along with the pot files, a seperate text file, like
desc-(langcode).txt can hold the descritption, which can safely be checked
and read from without touching the plugin.

None of the solutions involve editing just one file, unless you mean the 
.pot file to create the .mo file, then in that case you would be correct.

I would rather work within the tools that exist now then having a lot of 
desc-[locale].txt files. You would have to create a whole new API for 
extracting the multibyte characters from the file. I would just as 
rather use the translate API, which two of the three involve and the 
third involves just allowing the user to download the metadata in their 
language from the WordPress Plugin Repository.

Hope this isn't too out of place, but translating plugins reminds me of
something I was thinking recently.

Obviously the back-end is in US English with the e_ flag to tag what is
translatable.

It would be very handy to have a mirror english launguage, perhaps  "Geek"
of WordPress that contains all the translatable flags from wp-admin... this
would allow you to easily change the names of the navigation and different
elements, without changing much is /wp-admin/

They can always use the method from #1 -- putting a noop gettext calls
for plugin name and description.

Happy hacking,

Ok, I don't think anyone has suggested this, but forgive me if it's already
been brought up.  Why not create a filter for the $plugin_data array that
gets generated in wp-admin/plugins.php file?  Then, if a one is
internationalizing one's plugin, they can create a simple function to hook
into that filter and used the gettext funcionts on the fields.

This has already been done and rejected as unacceptable, both as 
practice/security and for convenience. There might already be a patch in 
the ticket that does this, or it might be in another location. Really, I 
think the solution was for adding and modifying the metadata, but it 
could have been used for this purpose as well.

You can just use a normal .pot file and customize whatever strings you want.
After compiling into .mo file, simply save it as maybe en.mo in in the
wp-contents/languages folder.

Put in the following line in your wp-config.php
define ('WPLANG', 'en');

Fair enough.  It just seemed like a relatively simple solution for the
plugin developer and wouldn't require the sort of over-engineering and
inconvenience to the plugin author that some of the other solutions seem to.

It is frustrating and I wish I never got involved with the ticket, "Hey, 
this ticket doesn't seem like it'll be hard, I can knock this out 
quickly." (Actual thought I had with the ticket in question.) Basically, 
I had no problem with what you described and what the patch did, however 
the arguments made against it are logical.

It will be worth it. There have been many times when I've been 
frustrated with the perceived lack of interest or arguments against 
something only to have something really awesome come out of it. I have 
faith that eventually "The Best" solution will be made that plugin and 
theme authors, as well as the core team will be happy with. Whether that 
is part of the three solutions or some other better solution, which has 
not been mentioned before.

There is a great amount of material for what solutions and counter 
arguments to many of them. Several solutions had almost all negative 
responses to them.Unless there is a patch or code that can be tested, 
then really this problem may never be resolved.

If this is something that many people feel passionate about and needs a 
solution, then a solution needs to be written. All that is needed is a 
patch which provides a solution and you will have more than enough 
people to test it. I'll be a tester and I believe others will also.

I invested enough time with the ticket, that I would love to discuss 
solutions which haven't been made before. However, I really hate 
conversations which go in loops. Already been there, done that, was a 
total waste of time, because the ground work had already been made and 
was just remade needlessly. I'd hate for another person to waste time in 
an debate/conversation that had already been hashed out before.

(Although, who is to say that this hasn't already been hashed out before 
this year, could have been discussed during the initial implementation 
of the plugin system leading up to now.)

What I've found, is that the best way to end a infinitely reoccurring 
conversational loop with similar solutions/point being made each 
iteration, is to just provide a solution and break out of it.

Please note, that the usage of "you" is not directed personally at the 
author who I'm replying to, but can be anyone willing to put in the legwork.

I think you misunderstood this a bit. The truth is that almost all 
problems with internationalization of plugins and themes metadata can be 
fixed by standardizing the way both plugins and themes are build for 
WordPress.

If we require them to be in a directory with plugin's/theme's name 
(which is the case with most of them now) and  have a sub-directory 
named "languages" containing all available translations in the form 
[plugin/theme-name]_[locale].po/mo, it will be quite easy to look for 
these files when displaying the metadata without the need to load any 
.php or other additional files, etc.

The .pot files will have to include the meta strings at the top and the 
plugin/theme authors would enter the information there. We could provide 
an empty .pot making this even easier.

The only problem with this method is that all plugins and themes will 
have to be updated to use it, but that's the case with all the other 
methods too. Whit this method, all that's needed is to add a 
sub-directory named "languages" to all plugins and themes that doesn't 
have one, and to include an empty .pot file in it, allowing it to be 
translated. I don't think that would put a lot more load on the download 
server.

When a plugin/theme metadata is translated, the translator can contact 
the author asking her/him to add the new translation and it can also be 
included on the [lang].wordpress.org site too.

Jacob Santos was suggesting to add this message to the codex, so it 
doesn't get lost, not to use the codex for translation, etc.

I think I found the ticket you were talking about and the discussion made me
realize that, of course, the information couldn't be localized until the
plugin was activated.  I knew that's how it worked, but for some dumb reason
didn't think about it.

I think the closest we've gotten was the suggestion to leave plugins  
exactly as they are and modify the core WP plugin functions to look  
inside the header comment in plugins and pass that text to __() as  
needed.

The only real objection to this (and a legitimate one) was that those  
strings would not automatically be included in .pot/.po files  
generated by apps such a Poedit -- which look for specific specified  
functions (e.g. "__()").

I think I have a solution to this, however:  .po/.mo files are used as  
they always have been, but we also create a standard "meta" .pot file  
that any plugin can use.  Since the meta header _names_ never change,  
the .pot for that data needs never change -- no need to auto  
generate.  Give it a specific standardized name (maybe  
meta_xx.po/.mo), and if WordPress see a .mo file of that name in the  
plugin/languages directory, it parses the data with __() without  
having to be told to.

To clarify:  We would standardize a .po/.mo file _for the meta data  
only_ -- the plugin header strings.  All other translation would be  
done exactly as it was before.

This system is _totally_ backwards compatible.  Existing plugins work  
exactly as they always have.  To make a new plugin work with the new  
meta-translation system, an author (or any translator, for that  
matter) would only have to use the standard meta.pot and make a  
translation file, and drop it in the plugin's folder.

Advantages:
It would work.
It is simple from the plugin author's standpoint.
It would be standardized on one template file that works with _any_  
plugin.
It doesn't break old plugins.
Any person could make a meta translation file without having to change  
the plugin itself _at all_.

What's not to love? :)

Getting the word out is not a problem. We have many places to document
its existence and make it findable via Google.

Any plugin or theme not hosted on Extend will likewise not have its
translations hosted on Extend.

It would be written.

That's right, it's not going away. What other disadvantages?

Faced with such complexity, one should look upon the third option with
great relief.

I hope you will see that the solution requiring the least effort and
providing the most utility is the third option. I hope that you will
write the few lines of shell script to extract metadata lines from
plugins and stylesheets and add them to a .pot file. I hope that you
will wrap this in a PHP script and make it available to the public.

I posted this a while ago to wp-testers but didn't get much of a
response. Apologies to those who subscribe to both.

Looking over the 2.5 admin screen source, all the <fieldset>s have
been changed to <div>s separated by <h3>s. Surely a fieldset with a
legend is more semantic than a div with an h3. This only bothers me
because a few of my plugins insert additional fieldsets into the admin
screens, and in 2.5 the styling has been removed from fieldsets.

I'm happy to write a patch to switch back to using fieldsets if it's
likely to get committed.

Can anyone give insight into this particular change?

If you mean bug reporting and tracking for the WordPress project as a whole,
you need the Trac (http://trac.wordpress.org).

Yeah, that too. Sorry, I thought they were talking about reporting

compared to mine, it also does not allow to tag a whole function call
(or code block) with several strings to be translated in it, it really
needs a separate tag for each. OTOH, it doesn't use an end tag, this
might balance it. Being less strict in the special-tag match is
probably better, like allowing arbitrary amount of whitespace between
"/*" and "WP_I18N"; should do that. As the tokenizer-method allows us
to gettext-lookup the string itself (albeit in PHP-escaped form), I
don't think recognising _all_ tags of the form WP_I18N_.* is
desirable; just _one_ start tag and _one_ end tag. This allows to
reserve the other ones for eventual future different use.

Recognising only literal strings was my goal. Letting translators
translate arbitrary PHP code can and will be disastrous.

Modifying the code, so that it doesn't impose so rigorous rules is
very easy -- this was just a proof-of-concept program. The main point
of the code was to show that the tokenizer is a good friend of ours.

Happy hacking,

Cool. But why isn't it on http://wordpress.org/download/nightly/ ?
It's not such a secret, is it? Or is it not on the page because nobody
has touched this page for ages? ;)

Why not change the respective part of the text to something like:

"If you would like to be part of this process, please join the WP
Testers mailing list. You can download nightly builds[1], or you can
download the latest development snapshot[2]. When you report a bug,
please be sure to include information about the build you're using."

Additionaly, development builds could have the build number in
wp-includes/version.php, and they could display it in the admin footer.

[1] http://static.wordpress.org/builds/
[2] (a link that will redirect to the latest zip snapshot in Trac)

(Maybe it's a good idea to file a bug for this.)

My code, as currently written, does not let them translate arbitrary
PHP code; it takes the pieces of the string that are literal and
translates them separately. E.g. when it finds
 "the dog named $foo is cute",
it translates "the dog named " and " is cute".

Assuming we decide we don't want to-be-translated strings to contain
variable references, only to be literal strings (which is what I would
recommend), there are several classes of reactions the translation
code can have when it encounters a to-be-translated string that
contains variable references:

 - fail noisily; e.g. return an error and a big fat error message of
   the form "I refuse to translate a non-literal string; change it to
   a format string in a sprintf()".

 - warning; don't translate it, but don't return an error and just
   print a warning like "WARNING - not translating non-literal string"

 - fail silently; not translate it and act as if nothing out of the
   ordinary happened.

 - fail gracefully; that is, make the best it can with the
   situation. Can (and now that I think about it, should) be combined
   with printing a warning.

Of these, there are good points for three of them, but I consider the
"fail silently" the worse and see no advantage for it. My current code
takes the "fail gracefully without warning" route (mainly because I
didn't think about that question up to now), I'd be OK with any of
that, fail gracefully with warning, warning or fail noisily, but I'm
significantly uncomfortable with fail silently. I'd recommend not to
take the fail silently route.

Yes, it is mostly overwriting your code with mine, and writing mine
was very easy, so I fully agree with that assessment.

Oh, I thought the "good friend of ours" part was already well
established (I was completely convinced of it by writing my code),
that's why I started looking into the details of yours; I thought you
suggested different detailed workings. If that's not the case, then,
well, nothing to say.

However, I think it lets them introduce nearly arbitrary code, if the
to-be-translated string is in double quotes.

This is not immediately obvious to fix, but no worse than the current
situation, where they can completely fork the code and make anything
with it.

This one -- we have enough experience with printf templates around
other i18n work. Let's keep it simple.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress PHP Extension (just information,
	no actual extension yet)
Message-ID: <47D320CC.1030202@santosj.name>

I put some four hours into trying to find a solution. The code I thought 
I had written, doesn't appear to be available (and it was very good 
too). Also, after some thought, it also makes sense that in order to 
compile PHP files, you would have to have the PHP files somewhere other 
than the /ext location.

This means you need a process which will move the PHP files into the PHP 
installation for which you can use zend_execute_scripts() to process the 
files. You can use PEAR, if you want to provide a solution. However, on 
some hosts, the include path does not include the PEAR directory. On 
some hosts, they do not allow access to installing PEAR packages or to 
PEAR directory itself.

While thinking about it. I am again of the mind that it would just be 
easier to convert the code to C. The problem with this, even if there 
are a lot of 1:1 relationships between C and PHP. If you deal with only 
PHP/Zend variable structures, then it does become a great deal easier. 
The only other problem then, is that you would have to go through each 
commit from when last library was created and fix all of the bugs that 
were ported over, as well as any bugs which exist in the PHP Extension.

This process of itself is pretty difficult and time consuming, because 
of the fast pace of the WordPress development. You could also do like 
the ADODB library and a CMS, just port the least optimized code over to 
an extension and then if that extension exists, call those functions 
instead in the PHP code.

This is all I have at the moment. The prospect of spending 8 hours 
trying to create a PEAR package and testing it does not seem worth my 
time. However, I just wanted to plug the information, in case anyone 
else wanted to either know or wanted to provide the solution. It will 
fall into performance and probably could only be used by those who are 
on dedicated servers or on hosts which allow access to both PEAR and 
allow you to compile PHP yourself.

PS: You will have to use zend_execute_scripts() [1] to load PHP files in 
a C/C++ PHP extension.

The only limit to categories that I know of is the number that MySQL can
store. Categories are stored in the same table as tags and you can have
something like 99999999999999999999 (or is it "just" 2^20?) different
categories and tags.

It'd seem a bit silly to make an arbitrary category limit.

As for the original question though, no clue why it's not working.

I can't say I know what's causing the issue, but I just thought I'd point
out that the limit should be 2^64 entries, seeing as the ID field in the
database is a BIGINT type.  There may just be performance issues when
dealing with a large number of categories.

As a follow-up to this, it worked fine after deleting all the tables,
and starting from scratch.

Today, I tried to migrate my WordPress MU site to a WordPress which
dynamically changes the $table_prefix depending on the value of
$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], and keeps the CUSTOM_USER_TABLE and
CUSTOM_USER_META_TABLE constants...well, constant.

However, I get the "You do not have sufficient permissions to access
this page" error again.

My blog's prefix is wp_2_, and indeed the wp_2_capabilities usermeta is
present, with the value of: a:1:{s:13:"Administrator";b:1;}

Now, I edited wp-admin/menu.php, and changed the wp_die() to, instead of
dumping the error message, to print_r() the contents of $current_user.

Sure enough, it has picked up the capabilities:
        
        [first_name] => Jeremy
        [last_name] => Visser
        [wp_2_capabilities] => Array
        	(
        		[Administrator] => 1
        	)

...so what would cause it to not work? WP capabilities are _way_ too
complicated for me to understand.

Message-ID: <47D3B3C5.1060901@santosj.name>

I notice that a lot of tickets are being moved to 2.6, while it doesn't 
matter, because everything that is fixed for 2.6 will go to 2.6 and 
everything else will be moved to 2.7 anyway. It would make sense to move 
enhancements which don't currently have patches to 2.7 and leave tickets 
which are scheduled to be fixed in 2.6.

Is that good or would it be just plain terrible to move that many 
tickets out of 2.6 and put them into 2.7? 2.6 is most likely going to 
have 700+ open tickets. That will be a lot of fun.

Would anyone be willing to throw together for me the most simple of TinyMCE

Hi everyone,

I was playing around with the custom DB error page, and found out that  
it gives a 200 OK header by default, even though it, for instance,  
can't connect to the database... Now I can hardcode the error 500 into  
the error page, but my guess is this should be solved or at least  
documented elsewhere? Not giving a 500 error results in the risk of  
search engines indexing your error page...

Cheers,
Joost

Viper is competing for the Great Masochist Trophy: says in one thread
he can't stand TinyMCE to the point he deletes the files, and is still
trying to code plugins for this atrocity.

		add_filter("mce_external_plugins", "add_myplugin_tinymce_plugin",
5);
		add_filter('mce_buttons', 'register_myplugin_button', 5);
	}
}

// used to insert button in wordpress 2.1x editor
function register_myplugin_button($buttons) {

	array_push($buttons, "separator", "myplugin");

	return $buttons;
}

// Load the TinyMCE plugin : editor_plugin.js (wp2.5)
function add_myplugin_tinymce_plugin($plugin_array) {

	$plugin_array['myplugin'] = URLPATH.'tinymce/editor_plugin.js';

	return $plugin_array;
}

// init process for button control
add_action('init', 'myplugin_addbuttons');

The time might be better spent on making patches, but that's my bias as a coder.

The "BIGINT(20)" specification isn't a digit limit.  It just means that when
the data is displayed, if it uses less than 20 digits it will be left-padded
with zeros. 2^64 is the hard limit for the BIGINT type, and has 20 digits
itself, hence BIGINT(20) just means everything less than 10^20 will be
left-padded with spaces on display.  This is kind of getting off topic
though, so...

Message-ID: <47D458E0.3070601@laptoptips.ca>

There's some info in the codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Migrating_Plugins_and_Themes#TinyMCE

The method of adding a plugin hasn't changed that much. In 2.5 there's a
filter mce_external_plugins that takes an array 'pluginname' =>
'path/to/plugin.js' for that. The only difference is that the path has
to include the actual js filename (in 2.3 it was pointing to the
plugin's directory).

It still looks for the [lang].js files in a sub-directory named "langs"
on the same level where the plugin file is. The language codes are only
ISO 639-1, the first 2 letters from WP_LANG, default "en". There is a
difference if a plugin shows TinyMCE type popup. It looks for
[lang]_dlg.js in the "langs" directory.

The plugin's file name can be anything, but the "langs" directory and 
langs/en.js and langs/en_dlg.js have to be present.

Buttons are added the same way as before. Probably best to add extra
buttons to $mce_buttons_3, as on low-res screens TinyMCE's toolbars may
push through on the right.

The js structure of the actual plugin is new too. Example:
http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Create_plugin/3.x

API reference:
http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:API

The action tinymce_before_init is replaced by a filter 
tiny_mce_before_init that passes all init settings as a php
array and can also be used in place of the deprecated mce_options action.

If a WordPress plugin have to support both 2.3.x and 2.5, it will need 
to have 2 TinyMCE plugins, for 2.x and 3.0.

Actually, my bias a WordPress user who has read about regressions on 
this list and on WordPress Trac tells me that there should be test cases 
for each of those tickets to prevent regressions and to accurately prove 
that the code defects and enhancements actually work.

However, if I was part of the core commit team, I would much rather 
spend my time trying to get the tickets that current have patches into 
the core or the ones that are stale to be updated to get into the core. 
One of the disadvantages of committing phpdoc documentation is that many 
of the patches that depended on the source before the phpdoc would have 
gone stale. I apologize, but I do think it was worth it. Also, not that 
many were affected it seems.

If I was part of the core commit team, I would much rather close out 
tickets which have no hope of ever getting into the core, so that 
community members don't waste their valuable time providing patches and 
support for those (few) tickets.

If you are trying to bring out the coder side of me to help provide 
tickets, then I'll have to say that the school part of me which wants to 
graduate wants me to relay a message, "It will have to wait until May." 
When that time comes, I'll be happy to take you up on your suggestion, 
but most likely it will be in the form of writing test cases and then 
patches. I'm sure a professional can at least appreciate that.

Happy Hunting is all I have to say.

There are still quite a few (older) tickets that have been either 
invalidated or fixed with the changes in 2.5. Most of these deal with 
the admin interface, the editor or the file upload/media library. I've 
been trying to go through them and close the more obvious, but some 
still require investigating.

IMO if we close all invalid/fixed tickets first, we will have a better 
view of what's in store for 2.6 and what should go to 2.7.

My opinion, for what it's worth, is that pushing the milestone out to 2.7 on
these tickets would only be perpetuating (or delaying) the problem.

As I see it, the "problem" is that there are tons of tickets with a
milestone set to whatever the next release happens to be at that time. This
usually leads to some degree of confusion, and at least one post on this
list (and elsewhere) shortly before release time to the effect of "OMG there
are still N... open tickets for the next release!"

My suggestion would be a more conservative use of the "milestone" field, in
which the value is only set when the fix (or whatever) for a particular
ticket is actually planned to be released in the version that the milestone
suggests.

For the default tickets which don't have a *true* version target (yet), I
would suggest either leaving / setting the milestone field to blank, or
creating pseudo-milestones to indicate "future release", etc.

I think this practice (if adhered to) might produce the desired result: a
more manageable and realistic list of tickets that are actually being
targeted for a given release.

That seems to be a good solution, but I remember a similar one that was 
also suggested and nothing has come of it yet or may never will.

I think the standard is that if a ticket has a patch, it is slated for 
the (trunk) release, whatever it may be. If the patch does not have a 
patch, then it is moved to the next release. However, this usually only 
happens during the feature freeze when it is decided what tickets will 
be seriously slated for the current release.

The effort is mostly dependent on the community and the core commit 
team. With any open source project, community members make patches for 
tickets that they feel like creating patches for. The current standard 
would work best and does currently, but mostly, I can't see nor do I 
want to see that many tickets pushed to the next release filling up my 
mailbox with sends to the next release.

I will say that with each feature added, it adds that many more bugs, 
and as the cycle continues so too will the increase of bugs. It would be 
nice if Test Driven Development were practiced, but I am not one that 
has the power to force anything.

If you don't know what TDD is, then I highly suggest you look into it. 
It is a whole lot of fun! It also helps fix issues before they come up, 
which as a developer who always tried to pinpoint problems *after*, TDD 
is a god send. There is also Behavior Driven Development (BDD), which 
also seems really sexy. I can't wait until PHPUnit 4.0 comes out! Please 
note that BDD is available in the latest PHPUnit 3.2.x branch. Might 
require the library developed in part by Padraic Brady and Travis(? I 
think it is Travis Snoozy (misspelled last name), and I could be wrong 
as to who the second person is).

Yeah, I get what you mean, and I understand how it has currently been
working (or not working); I'm just saying I think it might provide more
valuable information if it were done differently. Currently, it's difficult
to tell which of the many 2.5 / 2.6 (and soon 2.7) tickets are actually
planned for that release and which ones are just there by default. I think
that takes enough away from the usefulness of that field to justify a
cleanup and process change.

Of course, changing would also certainly require effort, but not much more
effort than it's going to take to continually move them to the milestone
corresponding to the next version each time. I would suggest a one time
cleanup and then a standard that specifies the criteria for when it's OK to
attach a particular version number to a ticket. At a minimum this should
mean that there's some buy-in / active ownership of working towards that
release date, as well as on-going "sanity checks" where someone like Lloyd
(or other volunteers) corrects what appear to be unrealistic entires, as
they do now.

All I'm really saying is that I just personally prefer to see a little more
meaning attached to the assignment of the milestone field. As it is right
now (or at least as I understand it), the meaning of the "next version
number" milestone is overloaded to include things that are actually likely
to be in that release (ie: people are actively working on them towards that
specific goal), *as well as* tickets that are suggested for "some future
version", plus some that may or may not even have any chance of going in at
all, but they're just there as a default.

No, I still can't stand it, even more so after trying to write a plugin for
it, but people who use my plugins use it, so I have to support it.

I brought this up before... I'll say it again...

a) If there's tickets there, like... simpler tickets.. either commit 
them, or forget them. Plain and simple. It shouldn't take 5 years to 
decide IF one should go in or not...and it shouldn't be constantly 
pushed to next "future release trunks" either. Flip a coin as to what ya 
wanna do with it. Done.

Examples:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5477
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5887
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5623
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5248
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4860

Of course the above are examples only. I know a couple didn't have 
patches with them, but still...As for the admin/ design related stuff 
from the previous admin design / setup ... I'd scrap those tickets... 
I'm assuming from 2.5 on out, the NEW design is going to be there, so 
really there's no need to have tickets lingering around from the 
previous admin redesign before the 2.5 version started...


b) Maybe make a new "commit team" or whatever.... that DOES ONLY that 
type of job. Job being, goes through them all, decides to keep them or 
heap them. Maybe even commit them as well. Of course, that "team" should 
be on constant communication with the Lead Devs and such.

We have a testers list, with tons of testers testing on daily basis. If 
the simpler tickets get committed, "we" (testers) can test them ASAP and 
report back with results. IMHO, it's not really going to cause more 
problems... some of those tickets are simple ones. If something does go 
wrong, "we" could report it and I'm sure someone could provide a quick 
"fix" for it as well. Hence having the WP-TESTERS right here....

c) Maybe make a "wp-patches" email list. People that spend alot of time 
testing and or in Trac itself... could join that list, send through the 
list tickets / patches that are up for voting as to what to do with 
it...? For example: Jacob finds 5 tickets lingering in Trac that have 
been there for years or months...

The others on the email list views those tickets... then reports back 
through list... "KEEP or HEAP". Perhaps having a list of users for just 
THAT would help better? It sure beats having to cast votes within 
comments on EVERY SINGLE TICKET on the Trac site... That team could come 
to a decision on each ticket's fate.

Heck, if there's some in there that need a little more LOVE, then 
perhaps that team can come up with better fixes, and have it for testing 
faster too... I don't know though, just throwing out my thoughts, 
opinions and suggestions... :P

I agree that there needs to be a change. I think that everything should go into "Future" by default, or even have sections listed for "enhancements" "bugs" and whatever other choices there are. Only certain people can elevate problems that don't have patches (which would be medium-high priority that need to be fixed on a maint. Release. Otherwise they just stay in what would almost be a pending folder, and as patches are attached, they get moved to testing, and then moved to the version when it has been tested and ready for a patch. I'd be willing to do the work of moving the tickets into the correct categories if this was decided to be done to get the first "main cleanup" done.

This may sound nit-picky, but designations like "bug", "enhancement", etc.
already have a place in the "type" field, so I'd suggest leaving them there
and leaving that type of categorization out of this processing. Same for
priority, severity, etc. which I'm not proposing need to change at all. I
think the narrower that we keep the scope of this proposal, the more likely
it is that it might actually happen.

The only reason I'm focusing on the milestone field in particular is that I
think it would be a good idea to bring back its semantic meaning and its
value, by having it actually refer to a realistic milestone that the
specific ticket is likely to be addressed in, and get away from having the
next version number milestone have all sorts of other overloaded meanings.
I'd even be OK with a milestone labeled "future", although if it were up to
me, I'd say always leave the field blank until it actually has a realistic
milestone target.

I think it would be nice to tackle just this specific milestone issue on its
own, since I think it's a bit more manageable that way. If we want to talk
strategy for how to approach it, I'd propose clearing the value on all the
tickets for which we aren't absolutely sure are going to be addressed in a
particular version, and then having the "owner" (assigned to, etc.) come in
and set it if and only if it's a "real" estimate (meaning that it's really
likely to be included in the specified release).

Trac Social Bug Tracking Development 

Mentor: Lloyd Budd 

This is a project that doesn't involve WordPress code, but Trac is such an essential tool for WordPress participation. I thought to include this. 

WordPress has a large number of "casual" contributors, people that contribute only a few bugs or fixes. These contributions are essential, and are the lungs if not the heart of WordPress. A fun way way for anyone to easily identify their contribution would be interesting. 

Investigate what GNOME and Ubuntu (Launchpad.net) bug trackers include for "karma"-statistics testing and development ticket tracking. See what is available for Trac, which may be nothing, and work on a implementing a system similar to GNOME and Ubuntu's. 

Although "Trac uses a minimalistic approach" a solution should be possible because of Trac's extensible architecture..
===

What it comes down to in the end, is that the only bugs/features that'll get fixed with releases are those that people are willing to code for.
I mean, Personally, I'm not interested in fixing bugs in the template tags, or the XML RPC code, However, I am willing to work on the updator code, The plugin code, & general code. Unless theres someone Pasionate about a feature, its just not going to be high on anyones minds. (Hey.. If i was being paid, i'd probably work on absolutely anything :P)

What it comes down to is having enough time to 
1. reproduce a bug,
2. find the bug in the code,
3. fix the bug,
4. test the fix with everything else that might rely on the code,
5. Post the patch to trac,
6. Get people to test the patch, 
7. Find someone with commit access to commit it.

I think 4, 5, 6 are the main failings at present, Quite often you'll find a bug with a patch attached, and theres just no traction on it; the main problem in that case is seeing a need for it to get commited ASAP, and there being enough testing done on the patch, A Patch isnt going to be commited unless either a) The person has the best understanding of that piece of code its patching, or b) the patch has been tested and verified working A-OK by a few people. 

I know in the past theres been some calls from people that think patches should just be commited and then let the testers deal with it, That does work in the sense it gets more people testing it, But it also has the downside of patches not getting enough testing before being released, Some parts of the code may be used in several different places, in several different ways, While a change to it might seem ok from most angles, It might not work at all when the function is used elsewhere. And then down the line a few months, or after a release has done, someone will pipe up "Hey.. Why doesnt this work? It used to!"; Sometimes people completely miss rare use-cases, and without testing before commiting patches, down the line it can become questioning how the bug got there in the first place (Now repeat this entire paragraph with the fix for that bug).

Test-cases are brilliant, If people can be bothered writing them, and running them on changed code of course.
If WordPress had test-cases which covered a large part of the code, It would be relitivly simple for nightly testing to take place, and to notify of any regressions from the previous days code, It would even be possible for it to pin-point the exact patch which caused the regression to occur. 
I'm one of those people, I dont like writing test-cases, I just like to see a problem fixed; I dont like having to run test-cases, because i *know* if it was fixed or not (As i'd be trying to fix a bug in one place), But that kind of thought isnt good, as i said before, just because it works in one place, doesnt mean it does in another.


As a final piece; Take note of these trac keywords which WordPress reconises:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs#Trac_Keywords
If theres a patch which you believe has a patch attached which you think is suitable for commiting, tag it as such "has-patch tested commit".
If theres a ticket which your not sure how devs want to continue, tag it, "dev-feedback"
If theres a ticket which you think needs more opinions on before commiting, "has-patch 2nd-opinion" (or "needs-patch 2nd-opinion")
If theres a ticket with a patch, but it needs some good old testing, tag it, "has-patch needs-testing"

Looking through the Trac Reports, theres really only a small number of tickets which are marked as needing testing, a few which are brought to dev attention, and bugger all commit candicates. http://trac.wordpress.org/report 

I think the main thing that needs to happen, Is that tickets get tagged correctly, and that people test patches before they get commited.. But no-one likes testing patches.. its too much effort :)

>   

I thought the same thing, back before I started writing test cases, "Ah, 
I don't need to write any test cases, my code is awesome!" I have to 
admit, my l33t coding skills are not, but one day, one day they will be. 
I don't think it is a novice skill vs advanced skill, because no matter 
what experience or mad skillz a coder has, I still think test cases 
should be written.

If you have written them before and don't like them, then okay. If you 
want me to hold your hand, along the way. I might not be as good as a 
coder as you are, but I know a few things here and there about test 
cases. If anyone needs help, just email me. I'll be more than happy to 
help you out with writing test cases for WordPress.

Finding people to write test cases seems to be a difficult task. That 
seems to be the general issue (I wouldn't call it a problem). You can't 
force people to do something they don't want, because they aren't being 
paid and if they don't have an interest, then they aren't going to do it.

I'm doing an entire session about it during the WordCamp Dallas, however 
the talk will focus on more code and different types. I'm not expert, 
but I believe if I can get a coder writing a few tests, I'm sure they'll 
be happy to write more.

I'll just suggest to write a test, but again, if you have already, then 
you know everyone has their dislikes and likes and you can't push 
someone into liking something. However, as a coder, it seemed natural to 
write test cases, because I was always wondering about writing something 
which helps me know when my code breaks, but isn't scattered in multiple 
scripts and can be automated. I'll be damned, if I didn't know about 
this when I was just starting out.

Friends, while I enjoy torturing myself, with writing documentation 
(just kill me, because I'll rather die than write a single line). You 
know, there are just some things which as a programmer, you need to do 
to take that step to being a professional. Writing documentation (well) 
and writing test cases falls into that "developer" attitude.

"I'm not just any programmer, I'm a developer." It is something that 
puts you above the rest. Anyone can code, but those that have the 
fortitude to write documentation and unit tests are far more reliable 
with their code than those who don't. This isn't geared towards DD32, 
but anyone who codes (myself included, I'll be honest, I haven't been 
writing test cases, so if you excuse me I have to whip myself for being 
arrogant. Just how many slashes is that again?).

Definitely true.

This was supposedly fixed a while back though:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3471
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2409

I wonder.

Your perfectly right, Writing test cases which can be re-used by others is an important part of becoming a professional developer, and so is Documentation, The worst possible function can be made a heck of a lot simpler to read if some documtation is available inline, or as a docblock.

I personally have *never* written a *proper* test case which can be re-used; I however, like many programmers, have writtne many test-cases for while debugging a function, eg. pass it data in several forms and check the return value is correct. However programs such a PHPUnit scare me; Simply because i've not used them before, Or understood how to write the test cases once i'm looking at the examples.

However, I am going to look into writing test cases, maybe not specifically for WordPress(but most likely as well), because as you say, The difference between being a programmer, and being a developer, is doing things right; Anyone can program these days, Heck, Some even do it well, But theres more to being a Developer than just writing code. 

(Btw, Where the ... are the current wordpress unit tests?)

Have a look at the dead_db() function and you'll see why:
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/functions.php#L1549

If the default error page is served up (Why isnt it using wp_die() anyway?), then the status headers are set.
If the custom error override page is shown, then its assumed that the override file is going to take care of displaying the error, So WordPress doesnt send any headers, just leaves it up to the override file.

Why _wouldn't_ a custom error page be sending a 500 error? I propose
that we set header('HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error') before we call
the custom error page, and then if they want to override it, they can,
by using a second header('HTTP/1.1 200 Happy As Larry') call.

I was thinking that some sites might want to serve up completely non-error output in those cases..

Yeah.. I actually agree on that, More often than not, users would want a error output, Afterall, it is an error; If for some reason they want it as a non-500 header, then they can override it.

Feel like creating a ticket/patch?

Yeah, I made this known to Alex and I forget the response, but I think 
it was borderline, "So? Why can't you use Linux?" (However, while I have 
the email in my archives, I'm probably wrong and this phase was probably 
my interpretation of what might have some other meaning.) Anyway, I was 
able to get around it by manually replacing the variables with the best 
I wanted to run.

I don't even do that now. I wrote code which allows me to run the tests 
from a web site. If you would like the code, then I can give it to you. 
It isn't clean, I modified some of the functions in base.php and moved 
the testcase class out of the file in to its own file. I've been meaning 
to clean it up and move my code outside of the official WordPress Tests 
library.

There are also problems with optimization with the Test Runner I'm using 
in the web site tool. I've realized that I can get the results using the 
current Test Runner in the WordPress Tests. I've written the code before 
I started school, and while I've been pecking here and there with the 
code, I've yet to fully implement the changes I'll be happy with.

I didn't have any problem running the test case I wrote before giving it 
to Alex. What I've done is just copy one of the test case files, rename 
the class, and rename the functions, while changing the code inside the 
functions to match what I wanted to test the functionality of the class 
I wanted to cover. I did test it to make sure it worked before giving it 
to Alex, but I believe I used my addon tool for the Official WordPress 
Tests Repository.

I'll be working on it more this week, (eh, only one math test, and then 
I'll be able to work on it) and hope to have something available that 
can be added. I'm starting to think my code isn't that great, since no 
one I send my tools to is actually using them. If you want it, then I'm 
sure you can probably do a better job cleaning it up than I could.

Jarad, what I was saying is that until they are assigned a milestone, they go into the "bug," "enhancement," etc just to make it that much easier to distinguish between. (if milestone=null then sort by type) Then when whoever it is that monitors for emergent items only has to look in the bugs group. Once they are assigned to a milestone though, they go to the milestone that they are assigned and out of the general categories. Basically, I think that having one folder called "future" would put way too many tickets into it to make it easy to go through and see what someone might want to work on.

This may sound nit-picky, but designations like "bug", "enhancement", etc.
already have a place in the "type" field, so I'd suggest leaving them there
and leaving that type of categorization out of this processing. Same for
priority, severity, etc. which I'm not proposing need to change at all. I
think the narrower that we keep the scope of this proposal, the more likely
it is that it might actually happen.

The only reason I'm focusing on the milestone field in particular is that I
think it would be a good idea to bring back its semantic meaning and its
value, by having it actually refer to a realistic milestone that the
specific ticket is likely to be addressed in, and get away from having the
next version number milestone have all sorts of other overloaded meanings.
I'd even be OK with a milestone labeled "future", although if it were up to
me, I'd say always leave the field blank until it actually has a realistic
milestone target.

I think it would be nice to tackle just this specific milestone issue on its
own, since I think it's a bit more manageable that way. If we want to talk
strategy for how to approach it, I'd propose clearing the value on all the
tickets for which we aren't absolutely sure are going to be addressed in a
particular version, and then having the "owner" (assigned to, etc.) come in
and set it if and only if it's a "real" estimate (meaning that it's really
likely to be included in the specified release).

I the usual pre-release discussion will simply change to "There's a new 
release due out soon and hardly any bugs have been given a milestone!". ;-)

We could tweak the system endlessly but I think efforts are best placed 
in working on tickets. I think the system works fine but we could work 
on changing people's expectations that every ticket marked for a 
particular release will magically get fixed by that release.

there is an article addressing previous MCE... If there is, that would 
be a good place to illustrate the new methods. If not, create a new

Message-ID: <56f01e000803100846k4719f4e8n4c0afb7a5bf8310a@mail.gmail.com>

Although I am a strong i18n advocate, plugin internationalization[0]
has always driven me back, because I had to add textdomain to every
gettext call.

Developers, they say, are lazy, so I thought of a way not to do this
any more. The result was the add-textdomain.php script:

php add-textdomain.php shareadraft.php shareadraft

This call adds 'shareadraft' as a last argument to all gettext calls
in shareadraft.php and prints the modified php file on standard
output. It makes sure it doesn't add the argument twice, so it is good
for incremental usage.

The script is available in the wordpress0i18n repo:

http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-i18n/tools/trunk/add-textdomain.php

Happy hacking,
Nikolay.

I doubt that would be the case. I suspect that as people actually worked on
the tickets they would assign a milestone to them, so you would probably
have a much more accurate picture of what was actually going to be included
in a milestone release than we have now.

Of course, the end goal is working on resolving tickets, but having them not
be all dumped in one gigantic default bucket makes working on them a lot
easier. As it is now, if I wanted to set aside some time to work on tickets,
I'd need to spend a good initial chunk of that time digging through the
mountain of tickets that are all assigned to the next version and determine
whether that designation is realistic, or whether it's nowhere near ready
enough to plan for inclusion in the next release, or obsolete, etc.

I agree with the tactic of changing expectations, but I think it's more
logical to change them towards something that makes sense and has meaning.
Just stating that it should be the policy (or "expectation") that the
milestone label pointing to the next version is essentially meaningless
seems a bit silly to me.

Oh, OK. I thought you were talking about assigning non-version based
milestones to tickets for sorting purposes and later changing them to a
version based milestone when appropriate. I was just saying I'd rather have
no milestone specified until there's a real one.

Nope.. Just an easier way to differentiate until there is a milestone.. I'd rather look through say 50 defects, 100 enhancements, and 100 of something else than 250 to pick things out.

Alex and Andrew just covered it earlier in this thread. ;)

You can also check out my plugin which I got working thanks to help from
them: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/

It's not the cleanest code ever and the plugin itself is a bit complex, but
I document everything, so you should be able to easily find the TinyMCE
parts. It supports both TinyMCE 2 and 3.

Right, I saw that. So could one of the three of you, i.e. someone who 
has actually worked with MCE buttons and has interest in MCE buttons, 
please consider writing it up for the Codex? I could probably do it, 
based on the earlier posts, but I don't even use MCE (I've been 
writing plain HTML since back in the days when that was the only 
option on the web, and it's faster for me than using visual editors). 
I would be glad to go back and edit the article for style if that is 
the issue.

Wonderful, a great start to the code samples for an article! :)

Really, please could you, Alex, or Andrew write an article?

Oh, an actual article. heh My bad.

I used http://codex.wordpress.org/Migrating_Plugins_and_Themes#TinyMCE which
covers it pretty well. It could probably use a code example though.

I want to have a wider scope for variables in my plugin, but for some
reason it's not working.  For instance:

$variable = get_option('variabletest');

function dummy() {
    global $variable;
    echo $variable;
}

Neither of those work.  Am I doing something wrong (I must be).

I don't know exactly when you are trying to call it, but in WP 2.5,
when activating a plugin, you have to declare the variable as a global
outside of a function first.

  global $variable;
  $variable = get_option('variabletest');

  function dummy() {
     global $variable;
     echo $variable;
  }

This inside a plugin works for me:

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: plugin globals
*/

$variable = get_option('siteurl');
 
function dummy() {
    global $variable;
    var_dump($variable);
}

?>

Keep in mind, That if $variable holds a false value (ie. it couldnt find that option) nothing would be echo'd.

Also, If its for use in a activation hook, I think you need to globalise it like this first: (as plugins are activated within a function)

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: plugin globals
*/

global $variable;
$variable = get_option('siteurl');
 
function dummy() {
    global $variable;
    var_dump($variable);
}

?>

A common problem with core hacking is the crazy number of globals. To
get around this, it would be better to call this at the beginning of
every function:

eval(G());

function G() {
return 'foreach (array_keys($GLOBALS) as $global ) global $$global;';
}

Enjoy ;-)

Regex would have been faster and less prone to bugs. However, in all 
fairness, I've yet to have a problem with tokenizing functions. It is 
just classes which give me problems.

Consider writing your plugin as a class. It's a far superior method for all
but the most simple of plugins.

Then you can just do $this->var.

I'm wondering what the best way (or anyway, really) of excluding categories
(by ID) from wp_list_categories (from a plugin).

It's probably something simple I'm missing. :P

Thanks,

In one of my old plugins I had to do this. You have to hook into the
get_terms hook. I used the following code. (The code was from 2.1 and
I updated it to 2.3 from memory so it may not be perfect.)

add_filter('get_categories', 'filter_categories');

function filter_categories ($input_categories,$type)
global  $good_cats;

	if($type == 'category'){
		return $input_categories;
	}

	$filtered_results = array();
	foreach($input_categories as $result){
		if(in_array($result->term_id,$good_cats,true) && $result->term_id !='' ){
			array_push($filtered_results, $result);
		}
	}

	return $filtered_results;
}

$good_cats is an array of category ids that you DO want. You can
reverse the check to check for something not in the array.

Subject: [wp-hackers] get_posts / query_posts need a pro
Message-ID: <47D6128F.6090709@gmail.com>

I really need some professional coders on this one. I had this problem 
before, but no one really could help before. Here's what I'm trying to 
do...

I'm making a theme currently, where ONE POST is calling ONE POST from 
ONE category. This post sits right under the header logo, then below 
that post is the navigation menu, then below the navigation menu are the 
rest of the posts...

The ONE post at the top is going to be like a "special announcement" or 
"site news" type of post only. It only needs ONE post at a time up 
there. Then of course, the rest of the posts below that upper post... 
are going to be the normal posts... The problem I had  before is... when 
using query_posts... like this example below here:

<?php query_posts('showposts=1&cat=3') ?>

To display the SINGLE post from a SINGLE category... then used this one 
for the remaining category posts...

 <?php query_posts('cat=1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,17,18,19,20,') ?>

It kills on the page load times, PLUS... when trying to click the "< 
previous entries" example: (http://localhost/?paged=2) all those posts 
are the SAME posts as on the index page... Is there a way around this 
type of issue or?

I was wondering if GET_POSTS would do what I wanted... like, get_post = 
(from this category only, only one) some how... then some how exclude 
those posts for the rest of the others in the lower section below... Any 
one with any helpful tips, ideas, code? Thanks in advance...

Hmm, I think I have something here... well, almost doing what I want it 
to do...

UPPER POST SECTION:

<div id="announcement-post">


<?php
 global $post;
 $myposts = get_posts('numberposts=1&category=3');
 foreach($myposts as $post) :
setup_postdata($post);
 ?>

<div class="post" id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>">
<div class="date">
                <span class="monthyear"><?php the_time('F') ?></span>
                <div class="day"><?php the_time('j') ?></div>
                <span class="monthyear"><?php the_time('Y') ?></span>
                </div><h2 class="posttitle"><a href="<?php 
the_permalink() ?>" rel="bookmark" title="<?php _e('Permanent link to'); 
?> <?php the_title(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>
           
                <p class="postmeta"> <?php _e('Filed under'); ?> <?php 
the_category(', ') ?>
                <?php edit_post_link(__('Edit'), ' &#183; ', ''); ?>
                </p>
                <div class="postentry">
                <?php if (is_search()) { ?>
                    <?php the_excerpt() ?>
                <?php } else { ?>
                    <?php the_content(__('Read the rest of this entry 
&raquo;')); ?>
                <?php } ?>
                </div>
           
                <p class="postfeedback">
                <?php comments_popup_link(__('comments (0)'), 
__('comments (1)'), __('comments (%)'), 'commentslink', __('comments 
off')); ?>
                </p>               
                <!--
                <?php trackback_rdf(); ?>
                -->
</div> <?php endforeach; ?>


Doing THAT there, shows ONE post from that ONE category, including it's 
CONTENT using <?php
 global $post;
 $myposts = get_posts('numberposts=1&category=3');
 foreach($myposts as $post) :
setup_postdata($post);
 ?>.

The lower section is using the normal loop so far... So, whatever is 
posted in the top, will show in the lower section with normal posts 
though... but I don't think that's a big deal... it's basically 
archived.. and the "< previous entries" link works fine too.. I THINK I 
got something here... notice I said .. "I THINK" lmao... It looks like 
it's working just fine.. so.. =D

Try:
<?php
$myposts = get_posts('numberposts=1&category=3');
$mypost = $myposts[0];
setup_postdata($mypost);
?>

then 1st line in the loop:
<?php if ( $post->ID == $mypost->ID ) continue; ?>

Just an idea, not tested...

Hmm, could you use your code above with the code I put in the email 
once? I'm not sure what, or where exactly this stuff is supposed to be 
going.. I tried various ways, but nothing seemed to be working. Here 
below is the code from the header.php file... (Just stuff for the upper 
post stuff) The below that, is the main index.php loop code stuff...

*HEADER.PHP STUFF:*

<div id="announcement-post">
<?php
 global $post;
 $myposts = get_posts('numberposts=1&category=3');
 foreach($myposts as $post) :
setup_postdata($post);
 ?>

That's good,

Andrew should update the Codex, I'm willing to help (my english isn't
the best one).

In the codex is written that : "Also the zipped file is cached on disk
to save some memory/server resources. This cache is invalidated by any
change to the init array or by changing the ver=[number] arg when
calling tiny_mce_config."

Currently I didn't have solved that, but I seen already problems after
a plugin add's a button later
then the tinymce-cache is generated...

Parsing PHP code using regular expressions is the same as parsing XML
using regular expressions -- a matter of preference. In this case the
tokenzier worked better for me and took me much less time to write.

Happy hacking,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Fixed pre-gettext strings in one dedicated file
Message-ID: <1205238343.32567.55.camel@localhost>

Hi,

Currently, there are a couple of files with pre-gettext strings that
need to be translated directly:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Files_For_Direct_Translation#List_of_Files_to_Translate

Now, the code in these files changes, while the few strings that are
required before gettext is loaded, almost never change. Still, with
every little WP update, these files need to be reviewed, and if
necessary, the translation must be merged into the new file. This is not
much, but nevertheless tedious work.

How about the following:
These few strings that almost never change, while the files containing
them change quite frequently, should go to a dedicated file and set as
constants.

For example in wp-db.php:
<?php
	require_once '../wp-includes/direct_translations.php';
	// maybe check if WPDB_ERR_SELECT_DB is set and fallback
	$this->bail(WPDB_ERR_SELECT_DB);
?>

This way, there would have to be only *one* file to be overwritten by
locale versions, and it would be a file that contains no actual code to
execute. This would significantly reduce (if not eliminate) the risk
that a locale version uses an obsolete or badly patched file. It makes
even more sense as the TinyMCE messages don't need to be translated
directly anymore.

What do you think, is this worth creating a Trac ticket?


Regards,
Alex

Small correction: Of course, wp-config-sample.php and readme.html would
still be localized, too.

Well, I wrote a plugin to exclude categories (by ID) http://www.codehooligans.com/2007/11/20/simply-exclude-plugin/ 
  This plugin will also exclude pages. The technique is noting  
mystical. Actually I lifted the category exclude from the Codex http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Queries 
  (look for the section 'Category Exclusion').

Alex,

We had an idea, about this problem in the debian bug tracker:
http://bugs.debian.org/461617

Thanks to Lionel Elie Mamane we now have almost complete solution:

Ok.

(I have read the above message and I know about the ongoing discussion,
but I didn't realize that it also touches the issue I was speaking about
here, maybe also due to the fact that I don't read all messages in
high-traffic threads.)

Hi there,

I'm Frederico Caldeira Knabben, Project Manager for FCKeditor.

We are aware about the importance of a WYSIWYG system for WordPress. It
would be nice to talk with you guys about our intentions and propositions,
and about a possible cooperation between our dev teams, keeping in mind the
current developments of our Open Development Effort, the next generation of
FCKeditor:

http://docs.fckeditor.net/FCKeditor_3.x/Design_and_Architecture

These are our first steps inside the WP devs territory, so please point me
to the right directions to expose our ideas to you. A nice option would be
having a quick chat with anyone or many of you, to catch up your
impressions. Feel free to send me a message directly in that case.

Thanks in advance. I look forward to hearing from you guys soon.

Thanks Sabin, good start -- at least there are now some coding samples 
(there are possibly some typos in hook names near the bottom?).

Hopefully Andrew can flesh this page out into an article describing 
how/why to add buttons to MCE, hopefully with a simple but 
fully-realized example (including the JS). I'd suggest something along 
the lines of some of the Special Topics articles in:
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_Resources
(and link to this new article from Plugin Resources, when it is ready 
for "real time").

Again, I'm happy to copy edit, but it's always better if someone who 
actually knows something about the subject writes the article. :)

I'm not speaking for WordPress or for the members of this list, but only
for myself. Anyway, I'm afraid that chances aren't too good for other
editors than TinyMCE in WordPress. TinyMCE is incorporated quite deeply
into the WP admin area, and the WP TinyMCE contains much customization
by the WP devs.

Nevertheless, choice is usually a nice thing, and I know there are quite
some people who replaced TinyMCE with FCKeditor by plugins or core
hacks. However, in my opinion, offering a core choice in regards to the
WYSIWYG editor used by WordPress would require some very good arguments,
why TinyMCE is insufficient, or why FCKeditor is a good alternative, so
good that it justifies the bunch of additional work for integrating
another editor or abstracting the structures to allow other editors to
plug in.

But that's really just my two cents (and I don't even use WYSIWYG
editors).


Regards,
Alex

I'm not speaking on behalf of WordPress either, but I like the idea of 
having both choices available in core, or at least a slightly more 
official plugin that works a little better (dean's is decent, but 
requires fixes to work on Linux, and has a few drawbacks: 
http://www.deanlee.cn/wordpress/fckeditor-for-wordpress-plugin/ ).  
Could we make both work, and allow the user to choose "Use tinyMCE 
visual editor" "Use FCKeditor visual editor" or "Don't use visual editor"

If you want plugins that work with TinyMCE to work with FCKeditor too, then
you'd (at least) need to provide the same WordPress hooks for FCKeditor that
TinyMCE has.

Hi Fred,

As the guy who did most of the maintenance on it for two years, I can
tell you that a lot of work went into making TinyMCE fit with
WordPress as well as it does. Automattic sponsored this area all along
because it is such an important part of the software and not at all
simple. Personally, I have no special love for TinyMCE or any other
rich editor.

There are many who have asked for your editor to be added to WordPress
and at least one plugin-based implementation has crossed my radar. It
is very unlikely that there will ever be two rich editors in the core
WordPress package, so you have two options: develop or sponsor a
plugin to add your editor, or become the chosen one by integrating
your editor into core and demonstrating its superiority.

The person you must convince (after you have convinced users, devs,
testers, and experts) is Matt Mullenweg. To my knowledge, there has
not been produced an integration of FCKeditor into WordPress that
surpasses the value of the existing system. It would be wise to
discuss it with Matt before you invest much time or effort into such a
project.

Cheers,
Andy

Not to keep riding a dead horse, but I wanted to chime in on this  
quickly.

Here's the full column definition:

`term_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL auto_increment

The '20' is the maximum display width. However, this does NOT limit  
the range of values that can be stored in this column, which for  
bigint is: -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

If its unsigned (which this one is not), a bigint has this range: 0  
to 18446744073709551615

If you specify zerofill as one of the options in the column  
definition, values will be left-padded with zeros. Displaying the  
value without zerofill will left-pad with spaces.

I've added most of the information from this thread to the article in 
the codex. Tried to make it useful for both new plugin authors and 
authors that need to update their plugins. It probably will need some 
editing :)

Adding JavaScript plugin example would make it quite longer and there is 
a good one at TinyMCE's documentation site, so just liked there.

I'm not personally affected by this because I don't use a particularly
large res screen. I was merely giving a method for having different
styles for widescreen monitors; as others in the discussion seemed to
like the idea...?

> simply making fluid -width

After thinking this through again I would tend to agree with you about
making it fluid width, it does seem the most logical approach. If we
go this route, the real question then is: do we have a max/min width
for the text editor, and if so, how large should it be?

It's been proved (I think), that people work best in text-boxes which
aren't too long, so having it the full width of the screen wouldn't be
a good idea on very large monitors.

By the radio silence for 6 days in this thread, perhaps it isn't such
a big issue after all.
Maybe we should be discussing the nasty new colours in the admin panel
recently...? :P

A min-width, yes, a max-width, no. I quite like writing in a full screen
editor, gives you more space to work, and feels open.

TinyMCE does not correctly mark up text, e.g. it leaves off paragraph
markers. If I manually put them in, TinyMCE strips them back out.

I install Dean's FCKeditor on every WordPress installation I create.

I also use phplist which uses FCKeditor. I can easily move between the two
systems without editing incompatibilities.

FCKeditor has made my WordPress experience infinitely better than if I had
to make do with TinyMCE.

Whoops, I contradicted myself there on the padding with zeros/spaces.  I
meant spaces, which is correct.  And also I heed the correction that it
allows 2^64 values, or 0 to 2^64 - 1 which is equivalent to 0 to
18446744073709551615.  :)

Be carefully what you attribute to TineMCE, it sounds like you are
actually describing wpautop behavior.

Do you have a specific example?

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC Project: Performance Pre-application
Message-ID: <47D75C67.8000108@santosj.name>

I've been thinking about it a lot and one area that I'm needing brushing 
up on, is building high performance PHP applications. I know a few 
things about the subject, but I think I can learn a lot more from the 
mentors on the subject. I've decided that if I'm accepted and you guys 
will have me, then I'll want to take up the Performance project for the 
GSoC.

Here are some notes that I came up with. I think it would be better to 
get some further understanding about the project. (The notes might also 
be useful to another student, if I'm not accepted or who wants to do it. 
However, the rules do say that no groups can work together.)

* A testing suite that measures performance of various components and 
can be regularly run against new code.

I was contemplating this and I think the general solution is to build a 
plugin which hooks into the shutdown and grabs the XDebug Performance 
file that is created (um, XDebug would have to be enabled of course). By 
pulling this in and building a parser (how hard can that be?), it should 
be possible to build a table of the work flow and find trouble areas 
during normal visits on the site. This solution will provide the ability 
to run Apache or PHP site tools to "visit" the WordPress pages, since 
not all of the code is executed during any one run.

The main areas of concern are the Plugin API (not much you can optimize, 
but who can tell?), Gettext, Post API, Template APIs. Also, it will be 
useful to find out which functions are called the most (besides the 
Plugin API) to find what functions to try to optimize first. Another 
problem area are long running (relative term, but percentage wise to 
everything else).

PHPUnit is good at manually running suspect functions for performance, 
but building the custom plugin and system, might serve better than 
writing test suites for each and every function in WordPress.

* Measure the performance gain having a build system which combines all 
major WordPress code into one file.

Given a recent discussion, it might be reasonable to measure the 
performance gains of having one (or two) WordPress library files and a 
build system (separate of the official one probably) that handles it.

* Finding sections of the WordPress code base that particularly don't 
scale well under load.

The first item would do the finding, the second part would be to 
providing patches which addresses any problems that come up.

* Review of the object caching system to natively support pre-fetching 
and zero-query WordPress pages (without wp-cache)

Given the recent discussion on the preloading pattern, I think it might 
be worth investigating which configuration terms are used the most often 
and write a plugin which writes a PHP define (something suggested during 
a recent discussion, unsure of who it was).

Some of what WP Super Cache does can be incorporated into the core, in 
writing HTML files to a directory and loading that file with hooks to 
plugins and whatever.

I almost come to the conclusion that this item belongs in the Integrated 
Caching Solutions GSoC project instead. I think doing tests with the 
mysqlnd extension to see where SQL optimizations can be made, the scope 
of this shouldn't extend to WordPress caching.

The API could be improved to set up theme sections which can be cached 
(if a plugin exists to implement the method) different times, which 
means that once a post has been through the filters and plugins, it will 
be cached and pulled in by the API. It'll probably be best to work like 
the Widget API and be as simple as possible. Probably be best to be in 
the other project also.

* If proper HTTP headers were sent from WordPress pages then external 
squid-like proxy caches could be used to vastly improve performance.

Totally. I think "Not Modified" and "last modified" headers could 
improve the experience for sites which use WordPress as a CMS. It will 
need hooks to allow dynamic content plugins to change the headers, so 
that the browser will be updated with their content. I've heard that 
caching is probably best left to the browsers (I'm unsure if I agree, 
until I see more evidence).

It will also help with Search Engine Optimization, since it will tell 
search engines whether or not a page it has visited had been updated. 
With that it will be useful for blogs also, however, the most gain will 
probably be in pages.

* Currently WP loads all its code on every page, could a selective code 
loading scheme improve performance in a meaningful way?

The answer is no. Any function which is conditional will only be 
compiled during the runtime, which will hinder the Opcode Caching. It 
should generally be assumed that helping opcode caching extensions to 
cache files and functions in the first stage is acceptable practice. To 
explain how the pluggable functions work with the WordPress library, it 
is that the code in the library isn't executed (except in rare of cases) 
until after the function call is made which is usually after the 
pluggable file is called and made available.

The functions will still only be compiled in run time, therefore, what 
could be done to optimize the code for those who do not use plugins is 
to use a Registry (I know I have the pattern wrong, what is the pattern 
called, which allows you to... Dependency Injection! I'm unsure if that 
isn't the method and not the Pattern name. Should probably edit this 
out, but I could still be wrong). Regardless, what it does is totally 
how the Plugin API works, except you can only have one function 
registered at a time. So the pluggable functions will not have 
conditional checks around them allowing them to be compiled, but allow 
allow for the function to be replaced by a plugin.

The Dependency Injection API will allow for the Pluggables to be 
compiled before run time allowing a Opcode Cache to save the functions 
during the first stage. It won't break backwards compatibility, if the 
functions are renamed. A possible problem is that instead of the first 
plugin which is loaded gaining control of that pluggable function, it 
will be the last which will gain control of that function. A possible 
solution is to run it through a filter and only use the function which 
is returned.

* PerformancePress: WordPress PHP Extension

You have three months, what better way to spend some of that time than 
to write C and C++ code. There has been one person which has said that 
if an extension existed, he wouldn't mind working on it also. I'm unsure 
if he or she will follow up on that (not that it matters, I haven't been 
to keen on actually going through with writing it so I'm only to blame).

The Plugin API almost needs to be compiled in C/C++ in order to be fully 
optimized. The Plugin API has been stable for a number of years and 
barring any minor corrections, enhancements, and bug fixes I think it 
would fit great in a PHP Extension.

That said, I think every internal WordPress function can be moved to the 
PHP Extension. Also, except for any function which uses database or 
external library calls, I think the most used (see item 1) can be ported 
over to the extension. Many functions in WordPress are fairly stable and 
should be fairly safe to be moved to a PHP Extension.

Furthermore, during my research, I've found many 1:1 PHP Extension areas 
which work just like you would expect in PHP. To further explain, many 
PHP functions exist as simple macro call away and you can call 
"userland" functions from the extension also. Technically, you can make 
mysql calls or more accurately calls to PHP globals (which the wpdb 
class resides in). However, I'd like to keep the extension as simple as 
possible during the Google Summer of Code, if this section of the 
project is accepted. (Note: the short and simple of this long paragraph 
is that in a lot of areas, porting functions over shouldn't be that time 
consuming. Ha ha, just kidding, but seriously, it could be worse.)

There is one disadvantage to using Zend Engine macros, is that the 
performance gained won't be as much as using native C++ STL style Lists 
or Vectors, however the Zend Engine ZVal Hash is pretty geared to 
performance, it couldn't out performance a well written list when a list 
should be used instead of a hash. Well, other than the advantage that it 
makes it possible for a n00b to actually even write PHP Extensions, 
which is pretty major advantage if you ask me.

Please note, "PerformancePress" name is just for marketing. I will 
probably call it WordPress Library PHP Extension.

I think this part will be a success if only the Plugin API is ported over.

Frederico --

I'm certainly no major decision maker, but here is my impression:

1) I always like having choices.  Giving WP users a choice in WYSIWYG  
editors would be nice.

2) I can't imagine it being part of "core" WordPress, as much time and  
effort has gone into making TinyMCE work, and the general philosophy  
here seems to be "K.I.S.S." -- i.e. leave the options to plugins.

3) I believe it _could_ be incorporated into a plugin that would  
replace TinyMCE with your system.

4) If such a plugin were made, it would almost certainly have an  
audience.  (On my blog, I once had a user of my WP plugins ask if they  
"work with FCK")

Good Luck -- it sounds like a worthy project to me. :)

Stephen

Andrew ,

very good !

One note, as I alreay said before I have problems with the cache/
compression mode.
I don't want to disable it, so I will add this to my plguin

function myplugin_change_tinymce_version($version) {
	return ++$version;
}

// Modify the version when your tinyMCE plugins are changed.
add_filter('tiny_mce_version', 'myplugin_change_tinymce_version');

I this a good way / solution ? Any opionion ?
Of course i can integrate a fixed number, but this could causes
problem with other plugins.

It was meant as a way to one-time invalidate the cache if needed. Any 
change to the init array will invalidate it too, so the tiny_mce_version 
filter is there just as a shortcut. I was even thinking that it's not 
needed.

What's good about it is that it will also invalidate the browser cache 
when changed. However I can see the limitations. Perhaps it can be left 
as in 2.3, filtering the tiny_mce_config url, so additional args an be 
added. Then each plugin can add it's own arg to the url that will 
invalidate both the server side cache and the browser cache at the same 
time.

You didn't mention exactly what kind of problems you're having with the 
cache file. Doesn't it get replaced when enabling TinyMCE plugin? Now 
it's stored in /wp-includes/uploads/js_cache. Part of its name is the 
md5 of all settings values, so the name would change every time a 
setting changes.

Bundling two RTE's is probably a bad idea. Just adds bloat, extra download,
etc. We should pick a horse and stick with it (and I'm not arguing for any
particular RTE here).

However, I think it'd be a good idea to make WordPress more module when it
comes to RTEs, not that it isn't already, but it could probably use some
more help.

Basically what I'm suggesting is make the core better support a non-bundled
plugin that allows the replacement of TinyMCE. So, someone either needs to
improve upon the existing plugin or write a new one. Then, wherever there's
problems integrating it into WordPress and replacing TinyMCE, a core patch
should be made up to fix the problem.

And personally, I'm interested in the fruits of this because it seems like
I'm constantly going in and fixing up posts made by clients in TinyMCE that
resulted in horrible HTML, either due to user error (pasting from MSWord) or
TinyMCE error.

Go easy on the users. It's not a case of user error, pasting in content 
from another application is the intuitive thing to do. I've done it 
often enough myself to realize that =)

Hi Andy and devs,

Based on Andy's message, let me try to reply to all of you, giving some more
information and coming with some ideas. 

Let me first clarify why we're coming with these proposals right now. 

During the analysis phase of V3 (FCKeditor 3), we have realized that,
working with development groups which will effectively use FCKeditor in
their systems could definitely enhance the final result. The idea is
interacting right now during the development phase, than later when
everything is ready, so we can consider every single factor beforehand.

We have chosen three areas where a WYSIWYG editor may have a relevant
importance: CMSs, Bulletin Boards and Blog Systems; picking up one important
OSS for each of those areas: Drupal, phpBB and WordPress. We are now
starting our contacts with these dev groups.

Andy, you have pointed out two relevant things: "it (WYSIWYG) is such an
important part of the software" and "not at all simple". These factors are
the base of our proposal to WordPress and to other projects.

Being the WYSIWYG editor such an important thing, we believe that the
WordPress dev group should propose the correct solution for it, instead of
simply picking A or B. But, as Andy said, it is quite complex to develop and
editor, so you are forced to choose a ready to use solution.

We would like to solve this problem. We want your team to participate in the
"WordPress Editor" design, leaving the implementation of it to our team, as
we are specialized on it. So, we are working on the editor, according to
your needs and specifications, while you are working in the WordPress side
to properly inject the editor on it. The idea is giving you some control and
understanding on something that is out of your hands today.

This is a long term thing. We are starting V3 right now, and we'll be
writing it from scratch. This is the right moment to talk about integration.
I predict we would starting seeing some results of it for the Q3 this year.

Let me also underline one thing. We are not proposing an FCKeditor plugin or
any kind of coding in the WordPress side. We are not WordPress developers
and we are not specialized on it. We are able to work in the editor
instead... that small text box which brings so much problems, hate and love
to all of you. But we want to do that integrated and synchronized with you,
so you will have the best solution to your community needs. 

> it is such an important part of the software and not at all
> simple

I also agree with that. It would just make end developers life confusing:
Which one is better? And so, why choosing if one of them is better?

> The person you must convince (after you have convinced users, devs,
> testers, and experts) is Matt Mullenweg.

Hopefully Matt could leave some words about it here, or please drop me a
message, so we can discuss it further.

Anyway, all the above is just a generic proposal. Nothing on that is static.
It is just a bunch on ideas. Please take that positively, as a theoretical
situation. Then, let's continue talking, possibly giving a format that would
satisfy your team. I'm just trying to offer cooperation.

Thanks again!

I think it would be a great idea to make contact with a plugin  
developer.

I don't how active these folks are on trac or wp-hackers, but if they  
have a passion for a particular editor then they may be willing to  
submit bugs and make patches to WordPress to make editor plugins more  
stable and easier to change. I think most of the functionality to  
replace editors is already there, but I've never really worked at it.

There are a couple, Deans is a straight replacement ( if I remember  
correctly ) for tinyMCE :

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/fckeditor-for-wordpress-plugin/

Monster Editor uses WP Super Edit to funnel from tinyMCE to an  
instance of FCKeditor. I checked out Laurel's plugin, it's a very odd  
way to add FCKeditor since it requires another plugin. For full  
disclosure; I developed WP Super Edit to appease my users.

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/monsters-editor-10-for-wp-super-edit/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-edit/

I know there is more out there, but these two seem to want to be  
fairly up to date.

During the investigation for the TinyMCE V3 integration, I had this
terrible problem with the cache file,
it's cost me 2 hours until I found the reason , that my changes in the
plugin dialog are not used as long
as I delete the cache file (not the browser cache).

If I extend in the future my plugin dialog, I want to ensure that the
cache is rebuild and after your post
I found the filter as the best option...

Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!

TinyMCE should not be in the core. It's as simple as that. In my
opinion, it should be a plugin. Perhaps a bundled one, perhaps not,
but the only thing that should be in the core is the necessary hooks
to use it, or any other, RTE.

The best way to go down this road would be to do everything possible
to move TinyMCE into a plugin status and to standardize the necessary
hooks and interface to allow things like adding quick-task buttons and
such. The editor can then hook in and intercept these calls, to add
the buttons and so forth.

Keep the core lean. Remove the bloat.

As I recently wrote in
http://foolswisdom.com/surfin-wordpress-25-with-safari-3/ we already
enjoy the full support of the TinyMCE team.

Many WordPress participants express how much they enjoy FCKeditor, so
there definitely is opportunity to let your code do the talking.
Andy's advice is sage.

It is save to ignore the comments that don't appreciate the necessity
of having a visual editor in WP.

Hope that helps,

Message-ID: <9FF0EAB6-FF04-49AD-AC02-E10D011A34C4@pixline.net>

Hi, just a little thing I've realized now: writing a plugin README we  
can define three links, author page, plugin page, and donation link.  
Is it possible to add a fourth link like "support forum"?

This is to avoid support information fragmenting across the web, from  
wordpress forums to each plugin author's comments and/or forum, and so  
on.

I think that being able to point users to our favourite plugin support  
website-or-whatever is a nice feature, and it seems to require little  
work to do (even if I don't know how readme's are processed).

I just want to clarify it to not pass the wrong impression. We're getting
WordPress as is. It is not my intention to start any battle with TinyMCE.

We just want to propose the possibility to WP to participate in the
development of its RTE since the early stages of it, which I believe was not
possible until now.

Thanks for your considerations Lloyd.

(repeating, but you asked...)

I think the best solution is to use max-width.  Yes, some people don't  
like it, but the average person demonstrably read more easily in a  
column of limited width.

I see three ways to adjust for bigger screen sizes:

1) Scale sizes up according to font-size, by setting the widths in em  
or %.  Then when people on big screens set their fonts to 16pt, the  
interface will scale up with it.

2) Include an alternate style sheet, so people who prefer full-screen  
text boxes can simply switch.

3) Just set a width and let the people who want full-width change it  
via plugin.

I understand that some people really like the full-width editor, but I  
say again, you folks are the exception, not the rule.  Most people  
have difficulty reading reaaaally long lines of text (relative to the  
font size).  As far as I've seen around here, the rule is to design  
for _most_ and let the rest use plugins.

I've said my bit.  I doubt I'll have much to add beyond this....

In the first TinyMCE compressor, the cache was invalidated only by some 
of the settings. That was fixed a few weeks ago, so now it is 
invalidated by any change in the init array.

The filter "tiny_mce_version" passes the version number as a string. It 
can easily be changed several times by different plugins. All of these 
will work:

function my_refresh_mce($ver) {
   $ver += 3; // or $ver .= 3; or ++$ver; etc.
   return $ver;
}
add_filter('tiny_mce_version', 'my_refresh_mce');

I'll add this to the codex too.

I'm more concerned about how to allow a plugin to use the same 
translation method for TinyMCE as WordPress, specifying langs/lang.php 
that can be translated with the standard WordPress functions and loading 
that instead of langs/[lang].js and langs/[lang]_dlg.js.

There are several ways possible, but all would require some more coding 
on the plugin's part. If you are interested in testing this, perhaps 
it's better to take it off list, as not many people would be interested.

Message-ID: <087D09CF-B66D-40BC-A024-F8C2787277BF@funroe.net>


I'm trying to figure out a reliable method to determine buttons and  
plugins added after all filtering in tiny_mce_config.php.

You can't do an include on tiny_mce_config.php (duh) nor is it  
possible to do a include capture with ob_start (no kidding). I know  
you could an fopen on the URL or maybe a curl and parse that, but I  
wanted to see if anyone had a decent method of divining tiny_mce  
options in other scripts from the inside?

So the only other possibility seems to try to capture the button,  
plugin, and other tinymce settings through some javascript dancing by  
doing a wp_enqueue_script( 'tiny_mce' ) and trying to parse the values  
without actually setting up an editor.

Am I missing the obvious?

Try using tiny_mce_before_init with a priority of 99. That would include 
the whole init array after all changes have been made by other filters.

function my_get_all_mce_settings($init_array) {

	print_r($init_array);

	return $init_array;
}
add_filter('tiny_mce_before_init', 'my_get_all_mce_settings', 99);

The above will break TinyMCE, access directly 
siteurl/wp-includes/js/tinymce/tiny_mce_config.php with FF to see the 
result.

Also it would be a good idea to disable caching while testing, so set 
'disk_cache' => false, in tiny_mce_config.php.

Oh wow, it really isn't unsigned.  To answer your question about posts, no.
The id field for the posts table is unsigned.  The term_id field for the
terms table is indeed a signed value.  I haven't looked at the WP code yet,
but I can't think of a reason of the top of my head why WP would want to use
a signed value for an id field of any kind...

Using tiny_mce_before_init was very worthwhile so far.

My solution was to store the whole initArray in the database as a  
tinymce scan so I can pull the option later. I will need to set some  
timing or comparisons up, so it would not run this filter all the  
time, but the filter itself will probably be a huge part of my plugin  
anyway. ( why peck at the other 4 or 5 filters when you can put the  
smak down on the whole sheebang )

Filters and actions are great, but on standalone script files it can  
be a little hard to see what is being filtered and action'ed',

Thanks!
Jess

So, are you (Andrew/Alex/Sabin/???) done with this article now?
   http://codex.wordpress.org/TinyMCE_Custom_Buttons

If so, I'll try to turn it into more of a step-by-step tutorial, so 
that someone who didn't know much about the guts of MCE could use the 
article to make a plugin that adds buttons. Right now, it has some 
great notes and code samples, but it's not in the same tutorial style 
as the other "Special Topics in Plugin Development" articles.

Let me know when it's safe to edit, and thanks again for putting all 
the information up there!

Reason being is that I was working on a patch, but didn't get very far,
because I couldn't figure out the best way to get wp_admin_css() do a
<link rel="alternate stylesheet"> instead of a <link rel="stylesheet">.

Why the heck do they have to complicate the inclusion of a stylesheet
with fancy schmancy new functions? Whatever happened to putting the
<link> tag in the HTML?

Go to My Profile, and you'll see two colour schemes to choose from.

While trying to exclude categories from being displayed, I discovered that
the code that works in 2.3, doesn't work in 2.5. I did a bit of digging, and
I discovered that there doesn't appear to be a get_categories filter defined
in 2.5.

Was this intended, or an accident?

I believe you want to use get_terms in 2.5:
	$terms = apply_filters('get_terms', $terms, $taxonomies, $args);
and filter for $taxonomies = array('category')

This one
$exclusions = apply_filters('list_terms_exclusions', $exclusions, $args );
may also be useful for exclusions..
(both code sniplets taken from get_terms() in wp-includes/taxonomy.php

Thanks.

Now, if I could just figure out how to use list_terms_exclusions... *sigh* I
hate arrays. :P

Hi All,

Apologies if it is considered off-topic here:

I'm looking to create a page on my blog which has searchable capabilities.

I would like to access an Excel spreadsheet to find a particular record, and
then display that record only. The spreadsheet is large - 10 000 records, so
displaying them all is not an option.

Something along the line of "Type in your name here:", and then going to
find the info required, and displaying it.

I've done a bit of a browse of WP Plugins and Widgets to see if there is
anything that partially does this, but cannot find anything.

If one of you kind people can point me in the correct direction, it would be
appreciated.

Thanks,

Bruce.

That will be a performance nightmare.  Is it acceptable to export it
into MySQL and then use an Ajax autocomplete function?

The problem, as you describe it, requires a custom solution. You say you
need to search entries, and you want it all on one page. This means that
you need an own table to keep the entries in an "atomized" fashion, and
a plugin to retrieve these items (and possibly more). Although this is a
common task for database applications, it's nothing that WordPress will
help with, by default. In WordPress, the "atoms" are posts; you *could*
put each entry in a post and use the WP search function (or a plugin),
but this would be a rather ugly solution. If you want something better,
you'd either have to write such a plugin yourself, or hire an
experienced developer (*wink wink*). 

Cheers,
Alex

This would only be an ugly solution if Post atoms were already  
semantically equivalent to some other real-world object. If not, they  
could easily be given meta-data, such as for an Address Book. Or, in  
the ugly case, findangle with category exemption in templates to have  
different objects co-exist.

The actual reason why this would be a dirty solution is that the posts
table is not laid out for his data. 10,000 records is not much, but with
a larger number you would want to omit spare columns, optimize the other
columns for your needs (considering data types etc.), and especially you
would want to index the data properly.

+1 most enthusiastically.

This is one of the things I always have to delete before delivering
to a client.

Note that the end-users cannot often even choose whatever browser they
want, but rather have to use what the IT department supports.

Please let's not discuss this again. See the ticket Ozh linked to for
details. If you don't want the BrowseHappy logo, write a plugin that
hooks into admin_head and inserts the following CSS:

#bh { display: none; }

I neither agree nor disagree that BrowseHappy should be displayed for
IE7 but Matt has made it clear it's not going anywhere (at least as
far as IE7 is concerned).

That's a shame.  I believe it's a poor mindset to have.  We as web
designers deal with the fact that there are many unknowns.  Do I like
that people view my site still in IE6? No, but as a designer I have a
hard time saying that it's their fault.  Most of the time they don't
know any better, and Kimmo correctly pointed out that sometimes it's
out of their control even.

They're are to many "Howdy's", XFN, and Browse Happy "pet projects"
that have made their way into the core.  Why not just adopt the "Go
PHP5" one while we're at it?

Why not? Because the dictator doesn't like it. If Matt doesn't like  
something, it doesn't get in. It's as simple as that. No-one else has  
any say about what happens with WordPress.

Last time I checked, WordPress was an open source software project,

I don't see how that furthers the discussion or your position.

I've shared my opinion long ago,
http://foolswisdom.com/still-browsehappying/ , and having done that it
isn't a topic I still get excited about.

Matt has shared his thoughts on this topic many times. I particularly
recall one discussion on #wp-hackers where he acknowledged that
http://browsehappy.com/ is grossly out of date, but that history has
shown Microsoft needs their feet continuously held over the fire, and
it sitting there in the footer is a regular reminder for him to make
the time to have it updated. Or maybe I remember wrong ;-)

I would love to see people contribute to an updated version, or
equally continue to share their strong well argumented opinions on
this.

Hope that helps,

Cathedral or Bazar style? ;) I'd usually say, in regard to WP: the
latter. But sometimes it's a bit like Scientology. *scnr*

(Btw, +1 for getting rid of "Browse happy". Alternatively: Display it
for FF users, too, and propose Opera and Konqueror.)

Would you let just anyone put anything into your pet project? I doubt
it. Open source just means you are free to take the source code and do
what you will, not that the original authors have to actually listen
to your opinion.

Making a project open source does not make it a democracy.

Definitely right. The baseline is, a project is for owner's need. If the owner
doesn't use or need the software, then that person won't be maintainer or
in charge of the project at all.

If users disagree with decision from those in charge, there are only a few
options left:

1. Tolerate and accept what is fed into your mouth
2. Fork the project
3. Switch to other similar solution

>From Matt's blog, on the recent discussion about MT vs WP:
"There are 4 core committers, dozens of developers who regularly 
contribute code, and if there's an unresolved argument or design decision 
I step in as BDFL<*> to keep things moving, similar to how things work in 
Python with Guido or Ubuntu with Shuttleworth. This allows us to have the 
best of community-led development (like the taxonomy system) without 
getting bogged down in bikeshed discussions."
<*> Benevolent Dictator For Life

Like it, ignore it, or even hate it, but basically, deal with it.

I for one don't agree with every decision Matt makes, but in the end there 
has to be someone leading things, or else we would just get stuck in 
endless debates. You just cannot ask every wordpress user on earth if they 
would like better their UI blue or pink. Cannot be more simple than this.

Ah. How nice that sounds. Unfortunately, there's a thing called reality,
and it conflicts with your simple views.

How about
4. Discuss options and make arguments

I'm really impressed by the number of zombies who fight for not having a
voice. It's ok if you agree with the "Browse happy" stuff, but why are
trying to suppress a discussion?

Besides, an OpenSource project is much more than the core developers,
and this especially true for WordPress.

Good answer... for important stuff... discussing something already
long discussed in the past and about a let me sa, stuid thing like a
minibanne in the footer of the admin dashboard is a nonsense.

There are plety of argument to discuss about future of WP than things
that 99% of people doens't care at all.

Sounds really good! May need to add some more to the loading of 
languages part, as I'm testing an easier method at the moment. If it 
works good and gets accepted, I'll add the description straight away.

Just a heads up for anyone using this hook in a plugin.

It's behavior will be slightly different in 2.5 which may affect how you 
plugin works.

See http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6196 for more info and example

I would rather see the site updated rather than the link removed.  
However, in the end, this is an EXTREMELY minor issue, so if I don't get 
"my" way. . .I don't care.  There's no real sizable benefit/drawback.  
To me something like Go PHP5 should be discussed, because it offer 
benefits to the code base.  This is really nothing.

I would prefer it less bloated than it currently is, with all the
useless information stripped (which is why I didn't paste the code from
the thread), and without the content duplication; but then again, I may
be biased, since now I already know how to do things :D

Maybe this is a matter of preference, but I find it way too long; I'd 
fall asleep before reaching the actual code :P

And the code itself could really use a clean-up; it is supposed to be 
proof of concept, right? (what was wrong with the one I posted 
initially, btw?).

I see what you are saying... but articles on the Codex are generally 
of a "tutorial" flavor, so I think I prefer to leave it as is. The 
information that you think is useless would, I think, be pretty useful 
to someone who hadn't written an MCE plugin previously.

I guess I am not sure why someone who already knew how to make an MCE 
plugin would read this article anyway. Someone who just wants to know 
how to upgrade from 2.3 to 2.5 should be reading this article instead:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Migrating_Plugins_and_Themes

Though maybe the "migrating" article is missing some needed code 
samples in the MCE section? You can definitely put your streamlined 
code samples, or the ones in the other article, here if so.

I'm with Matt on that one. IE7 is not enough to suggest that it's up to par
with standards. BrowseHappy is still needed until that time.

Agreed. IE7 is a huge step in the right direction, but those IE specific CSS
stuff is still needed in many places.

Anyway that's tried IE8 would agree. It's far more standards-strict
than even FF or Opera.

You're not much more realistic than I do. This only works when the peer
you're trying to discuss with allows discussion from the beginning. I'd like
to see your facial expression if the reply to your 'discussion' is an insult or
dismissal.

/me quit from this thread too.

I will add my voice rather than being a silent watcher as I am for most of
the time.

Does this small sign really matters for IE.  I am not sure and not convinced
at all the M$ needs continuous hammering.  What matters for big companies is
when common users understands the problem of monopoly and switch to another
brand to raise their anger/frustration. This is the only way  to make it
work  be it  Apple  or M$ or IBM( to name only three.)

There are lots which can be added at the bottom from religion to sex so that
we can raise awareness of being "politically  correct" but not sure if any
Free Software is the place for the same.

-Cheers

Subject: [wp-hackers] Internal representation of time
Message-ID: <47DA8969.8090703@freecharity.org.uk>

(see http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2149)

WordPress appears to be a little confusing with it's internal 
representation of time. Times are stored in MySQL as the DATETIME type 
but manipulated internally by converting DATETIME to Unix time stamps, 
which can be easily manipulated with PHP.

The range of dates which can be represented by Unix timestamps 
(1901-12-13 to 2038-01-18) is a small subset of the range of dates which 
can be represented by MySQL DATETIME (1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31).

At the moment entering a date outside of Unix timestamp range results in 
the correct date being stored (sometimes!) in the database but presented 
as 1970-01-01 to the user.

Which range of dates should we expect WordPress to be able to handle? 
Manipulating DATETIME values in PHP is tricky but can be worked around 
by asking MySQL to do the calculations for us.

We could even go so far as to use something like PEAR's Date package.

I guess that leaves us with three options

- Stick to Unix timestamps. Stricter validation to handle input outside 
the valid range. This requires least change to the code.
- Switch completely to MySQL timestamps. Stricter validation ...
- Use an outside library to handle time.

I'm equally happy with any approach, and coding a patch for it, but 
what's the feeling on the list?

Little correction: Unix timestamps are always defined as the seconds
elapsed since 1970-01-01.

Well, I just learnt that Unix timestamps can also be expressed as
negative integers, so indeed they can express times before 1970. How
educational it can be to participate in a ML. :)

Thanks, for the discreet e-mail, Aaron. ;) And, sorry, James.

A related problem is the fact, that the Unix time stamps are not really
correct when it comes to the gmt and local timestamps.  The database
DATETIME value is always converted to the Unix time stamp that has the
same textual representation in the local timezone of the server.

That is, you get the same value back from mysql2date('U', $datetime),
regardless of whether $datetime comes from post_date or post_date_gmt.

At the minimum I'd like to see 2 new functions in WordPress in this
regard:

function post_gmt_offset($post)
{
    $local = mysql2date('U', $post->post_date);
    $gmt = mysql2date('U', $post->post_date_gmt);

    return $local - $gmt;
}

function post2gmt($post)
    $m = $post->post_date_gmt;
    $i = gmmktime(
	substr($m, 11, 2), substr($m, 14, 2), substr($m, 17, 2),
	substr($m,  5, 2), substr($m,  8, 2), substr($m,  0, 4)
    );
    return $i;
}

I think Unix time stamps might be a good way to go since they can be
handled by PHP without any extra code and without having to call on an
external service such as MySQL for calculations.

Message-ID: <a21f1bf40803140926k36fdb2b3k2075e21b98324598@mail.gmail.com>

(New to the list so please excuse me if I'm covering old ground.)

When researching an issue I encountered on my test setup, I came
across ticket 5331 ( http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5331 ). Expanded
a little and put into my own words, here's the problem.

With a permalink structure of `/%category%/%postname%/` the category
slug will return content without the category base.

Example: `site.com/my-category/my-post-slug/` works exactly as
expected. But if you crawl up, `site.com/my-category/` returns status
code 200 and displays the content from My Category, just as if the
page viewed was the correct `site.com/category-base/my-category/`.

That's not good SEO, since identical content would be returned for
both `/my-category/` and `/category-base/my-category/`. It would be
better to handle this as a 404, and even better to handle it as a 301
to the correct address with the category base.

I'm currently handling this on my own setup with .htaccess redirects
to 301 to the proper addresses, but wouldn't it be better for WP to
handle this automagically? The ticket on Trac also mentions that the
pagination links created by `next_posts_link()` will incorrectly point
to `site.com/my-category/page/2/`, which returns 404. That's not great
for SEO either, and worse still, could confound users.

On a somewhat related issue, has there been any talk about changing
the way pagination permalinks are used? The default arrangement of
using `site.com/page/2/` leaves `/page/` as a pseudo-directory that
returns 404. Would it perhaps be better to use a default setup like
`site.com/page-2/` where there's no empty directory to 404 when a
visitor or search engine crawls up the directory structure?

I'm sure the pagination issue could probably also be resolved with
redirects, but I'm no .htaccess wizard, and again, wouldn't it be
better for WP to address this?

Thanks for reading.

I'm using:

svn rev 7290 and wp 2.3.3 (both issues exist identically in both versions)
Linux 2.6.9-67.0.4.ELsmp (that's all my host tells me on that)
Apache 1.3.39
MySQL 5.0.45-community
PHP 5.2.4

It doesn't have any real-world effect, but it makes somebody feel good, and
that seems to be what's important.

The combination of this badge and the Flash uploader is unfortunate, since
anybody watching might think that a commitment to standards only happens

I created a WordPress Plugin to hide the Browse Happy logo which you can use
to remove the Browse Happy logo from the footer, particularly if it's a
client project. You can find the Plugin at
http://sudarmuthu.com/blog/2008/03/15/no-browse-happy-plugin.html

Disclaimer: I neither agree nor disagree in removing the browse happy logo
and in my point of view it is a very small thing to argue about.
In short, I just wasted two minutes to stop someone from wasting hours in
arguing about something which is useless (at least in my point of view) ;-)

	resolution
Message-ID: <1fa535a70803142050s47fc3a84ue35c5e12977a14e8@mail.gmail.com>

I notice the min-width of the 2.5 admin screen is set to 808px. This
means that at a screen resolution of 800x600 pixels, horizontal
scrollbars are displayed. Is there any particular part of the admin
screen, or any other reason, which means the min-width cannot be
dropped down to something like 780px to accomodate users with 800x600
resolutions? We'd all love for everyone to be on at least 1024x768 but
that's not the case in the real world.

On a related note, the Media Manager is also unusable at 800x600
resolution as the tab bar at the top goes off the top of the screen,
The popup iframe either needs to have a fluid height, or the position:
fixed needs to be dropped.

Most users are on 1024, but a liquid layout still seems the most  
reasonable approach.

I just tried it at 780pxs on the localhost testbed, went to dashboard 
and there's STILL a scroll bar there. It's not THAT BAD though, but it's 
still there...

Crap, even down at 760px min-width on body (wp-admin.css), gives same 
small scroll. Means there'd have to be mad changes throughout the

Hi All,

I have created some new views in trac which some of you may find useful
when looking for things to test or work on.

The new views are:

http://trac.wordpress.org/report/23
Release blockers - serious bugs on large new features

http://trac.wordpress.org/report/24
Issues which could do with some unit tests being written before they can
be resolved

http://trac.wordpress.org/report/25
Tickets which need some phpDoc love.

Hopefully these should help people find a way to get involve.

Message-ID: <8f93a7390803160227l43042dd3te1a1181007be2ab@mail.gmail.com>

So I've been playing around with
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/semisecure-login/

It's a nice half way point for people like me who don't have and don't want
to mess with SSL. It MD5's the password field before submitting and then
checks it against the MD5'ed version of the password in the database. Works
great in 2.3.x.

However, with phpass now being used (i.e. salted passwords), I thought I'd
update it for my own personal uses (and maybe a release) in time for WP 2.5.
Easier said than done it's turning out to be.

Is it even possible? I can't think of a way to take the MD5 of the password
and use it to check the password due to the salting. I can't MD5 the
original password and compare it to the submitted hash as the original
obviously isn't stored anywhere.

What about the upgrade method though? Does 2.5 migrate the old MD5 hashes to
the new method or does it just leave them alone and only screw with the
cookies?

Ideas needed, assuming it's actually possible. I'm a bit inexperienced with
some of the new features.

When the user logs in, if the password hash is <= 32 char, then it creates a new hash for the user with a salt added in.

I dont think theres a secure method of client side password hashing now, it either has to be 2-way encryption so that the server can get the original password, Or you need to pass the salt back to the JS and implement phpass in javascript, neither of which you'd want to do.

You of course, could store another password in the database which is not salted, so that it allows you to login via passing a hashed password along, but its not of much use IMO

Personally, even if you encrypt the password at client side using md5,
it is still subject to replay attack.

A better system would be: http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/auth.html

Yeah, this isn't assumed to be 100% secure, merely a way to avoid sending
the password plaintext via an unencrypted connection (like a public wifi or
whatever).

Anyway, so if it does indeed "upgrade" the old MD5 hash in the database to a
new salted one, I could salt the POST'ed MD5 hash and compare it to the one
in the database, no?

Oh wait, that wouldn't work for accounts created in WP 2.5, right? Bah.

Guess I'm outta luck. Oh well.

I dont think it used MD5 anymore at all, instead it uses a "portable hash".. whatever that is. I might be wrong though.

Might be best looking up the old trac ticket for the changes, and/or asking Ryan (I think he had his hands in with that lot?)

Good luck though :)

It's combined with a one-time use nonce, so I don't believe that can happen.

DD32: Yeah, the new hashes are longer than 32 characters and MD5 sucks, so I
figured, but I'm still trying to figure out if I can get from MD5( $pass )
to $newHash somehow. I'll poke around the code some more.

I think (I'm away from home and unable to check precisely) that when  
I coded the new password functions things were left pluggable in the  
right places to allow you to use a different hashing algorithm. If  
you really wanted to use this plugin, you might be able to write  
another plugin that reinstates plain MD5 passwords. Please let me  
know if this isn't the case. :-)

No no, I think the salt and all that stuff is a good idea. I don't want to
mess with it or the database.

I'm just trying to figure out a way to not send the password in plain text.
MD5'ing it + a separate salt worked well with 2.3.x, but it's proving to be
trouble in 2.5.

Have you ever tried using this plugin:

http://www.redsend.org/chapsecurelogin/

It's based on the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) and it
seems to work pretty well. It might at least be a starting point for what
you're trying to do.

It's quite similar to the plugin I was using as a base.

I assume it too is broken by WordPress 2.5 though as it'll have trouble
comparing a hashed version of the password (made via JS) against another
hashed version of the password (in the DB).

How about base64 encoding it before sending it, then decode it before
WP handles it. It's in no way as secure as MD5, but it's better than
plain text (people trying to steal password would probably not bother
or recognize it as base64 and move along)...

That's just security through obscurity though.

Perhaps the base64 encoded string could be modified randomly in a
pre-determined way though that only the host and the client knew about
(similar to a salt). Something like adding some characters after X
characters, etc.

I haven't given up on MD5 though. I'm gonna read some more into how WP salts
the passwords and stuff. Hopefully it still uses a MD5 of the password
somewhere (pre-salt or something).

Nevermind about this whole thread. I don't think it's possible as while I
don't know about migrated passwords, I believe all post-2.5 passwords will
be encrypted without ever touching MD5. Just a direct password -> phpass and
replicating phpass with JS doesn't look easy or a good idea.

Obscuring a base64 encoded string also won't work because the server has to
tell the client how to obscure it which someone could easily intercept and
then use to fix the malformed hash and then decode it.

Oh well. I guess it's either SSL or nothing.

I just want to echo Richard's comments, as it seems from posts
that there aren't many others on this list that do.

During building a cookie-cutter Wordpress installation, I tried
at least half a dozen 'WYSIWYG' editors, including most of those
mentioned. None comes close to FCKeditor.

I did the porting of the new phpass hashing to bbPress, and I'm 99.99%  
sure that what you want can't be achieved.

You would need to enlist your own reversible hashing (in Javascript  
and PHP) to pass the real password to the login functions.

Yeah, pretty much (for what it sounds like you want to do, anyway). If there
is the possibility for interception that you mention above, then it wouldn't
matter if you could reimplement the same phpass alogrithm on the client,
since whatever you send to the server could still be captured and replayed,
resulting in a successful login.

Yeah, that's why a one-way hashing method is needed.

Previously, the JS would MD5 a string made up of the MD5 of the password
plus a one-time salt, and then the server would replicate that (it already
had the MD5 of the password) and compare.

H hackers,

I just received conformation that our application to GSoC 2008 was accepted!

It's going to be an amazing time, thanks to Google, and all the
mentors that have already committed. It's not to late, if you are
still interested in participating as a mentor.

Students, now is when to start researching and documenting your ideas.
Please see the WordPress Summer of Code 2008 page in the codex and our
application template. Please join us on our mailing lists to discuss
your idea. You will be able to submit your applications from March 24
through 31.

Thanks,

I'm looking forward to applying as a student.  I just thought I'd
double-check - it is allowed/recommended to submit applications for multiple
ideas, right?  Within reason of course.  I'm not about to submit an
application for every idea listed on the ideas page, but I just make sure we
don't have to limit ourselves to one and hope like hell we get it...

Hi Dan,

Don't limit yourself to what is on that page. By sharing your ideas
here and on your blog, and participating in WordPress now, you will
have a stronger application.

I won't recommend submitting more than two applications.

Hope that helps,

H hackers,

I just received conformation that our application to GSoC 2008 was accepted!

It's going to be an amazing time, thanks to Google, and all the
mentors that have already committed. It's not to late, if you are
still interested in participating as a mentor.

Students, now is when to start researching and documenting your ideas.
Please see the WordPress Summer of Code 2008 page in the codex and our
application template. Please join us on our mailing lists to discuss
your idea. You will be able to submit your applications from March 24
through 31.

Thanks,
--

Yep, Lloyd, that definitely helps.  I may go against your non-recommendation
though and submit three.  I'm fairly interested in both the forum
import/export standard and the batch attribute editing ideas listed on the
site, and I also have my own little pet project that may or may not have any
chance of acceptance.  I brought up the idea on this list a while ago of
some comprehensive documentation with an emphasis on code flow and it was
met with a lot of skepticism, but I figure I'll just throw it out there
again when the time comes.  I realize the discussions before left the
subject pretty muddled, so dont' worry - I'll make sure I make myself very
clear in my application.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP and spam 
Message-ID: <47DF47CE.2080402@gmail.com>

Just curious, but, will there maybe be some type of better spam removal 
process with WP in future? I'm not sure what to do, or what COULD BE 
done to make things better... but here's what I'm dealing with now...

I have the following anti-spam plugins installed and running.

Bad Behavior 2.0.13
CJD Spam Nuke 1.5.3
Spam Karma 2 2.3 rc4 (plus Akismet)

Here's what's going on...Every day, I'm getting spam caught in the 
Manage > Spam section. This of course, being the CJD Spam Nuke plugin... 
Without this, the spam would just build up in the database, making the 
database huge .. if I didn't have that plugin...

Is there SOME way, that these spams caught in the Manage > Spam section, 
could be added to some sort of spam ip address database or whatever... 
to give spammers a blockage or bad script page or denied access of some 
sort, using one of the Bad Behavior / Spam Karma + Akismet plugins?

Like maybe, whatever spams get stuck in the CJD Spam control section.. 
add them to a database of some sort, then one of the other plugins give 
a blockage to them so there's no way they could spam a persons blog 
again... I know this might sound confusing... but it's a shame that 
these spams end up in the database piling up, making the database grow 
in size, because WP doesn't know how to remove it automatically or block 
them from even making spam on the blog...

I'm not sure if these spams are missed by the other two plugins, or 
what. But it sure gets tiresome having to go there to delete spams all 
the time. Yet, it shouldn't be building up in the database either if I 
didn't have that plugin there to use...

I only run SK2 with the SK2 Akismet plugin (best of both worlds -- Akismet
helps tell SK2 what's spam). I get very little spam, especially when SK2
slaps older comments based on newer ones (hence the karma part).

SK2 also trims out old spam to clean up the DB.

Yeah, that's what I got too. If you remember back far enough, you're the 
one I learned of that plugin from you originally.. LOL! I think in the 
support forums some where, or even yahoo messenger waaaay back. =P I'll 
have to read up where or how to clean up old spams in the database... =)

Glad to hear this. This year's SoC should be better than ever. I can't wait
to see what students will be involved and what projects are proposed.
Speaking of that, I should have another project proposal ready tomorrow.

LoL! Since we're using that plugin for SK2... is there already code 
there for this, or could there be a way to just add this to the plugin 
file...

function akismet_delete_old() {
    global $wpdb;
    $now_gmt = current_time('mysql', 1);
    $wpdb->query("DELETE FROM $wpdb->comments WHERE DATE_SUB('$now_gmt',

    $n = mt_rand(1, 5000);
    if ( $n == 11 ) // lucky number

}

On the "Recent Spam Harvest" screen, there's a checkbox to automatically
purge spam over X days old.

Message-ID: <74b84aa30803180428k85f1908x42c38a1a9aae47c6@mail.gmail.com>

Typography chosen for the Wordpress admin appears to be heavily
leaning towards Mac users. I'd love to see better support for other
platforms too:

On Sans-serif type:

In the file: /wp-admin/css/global.css?version=2.5-RC1

I see the following:

font: 13px "Lucida Grande", "Lucida Sans Unicode", Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;

While it looks great on a Mac, I wish it were like this:

font: 13px "Lucida Grande", "Bitstream Vera Sans", Calibri, Verdana,
sans-serif; (==> Mac, Linux, Windows, and everyone else.)

(This would support Ubuntu and Vista along with the Mac; I know
Calibri has a size issue---may be we could adjust its size in
percentage?---just bouncing off ideas; Again, I'm choosing the font
that would look best in a given platform, rather than looking for the
exact look-alike.)

"Lucida Sans Unicode" and Tahoma are illspaced and edgy (in Windows at
least), and therefore should be dropped from using---my opinion.

There are also a number of excellent platform wise mono-spaced fonts:

Monaco (Mac), Consolas (Windows Vista), "Bitream Vera Sans Mono"
(Ubuntu), Monospace, "Courier New" (Windows XP, 2000, 98).

Could these be used---in that order---to define permalink url below
the title, and/or in the text area?

I have a number of plugin I have created over the years and I would like to
host them in the official repository but I am having some trouble working
out how to structure the plugin files in my own case. I already have two
plugins hosted there with no difficulty but I have four other plugins
(Similar Posts, Recent Posts, Recent Comments, and Random Posts) which share
a common code library. Currently I have users upload one folder for each
plugin and one for the shared library. I package four zip files, each with
the two folders in. Now, how do I do something like that with the
repository?

If I have two folders under the svn folder how do I stop users manually
doing the usual thing and uploading the single folder which the repository
supplies? Above all with automatic plugin updates now in place how do I get
that process to work? I want to avoid duplicating the library code four
times.

In summary, the folder structure I want is:

plugins/
	similar-posts/
	recent-posts/
	recent-comments/
	random posts/
	post-library/

Any ideas?

Message-ID: <7066f5ca0803180850u78321eceo84251f80ccfd1582@mail.gmail.com>

Hi wp-hackers,

I am Corey Shaffer and I am looking to be a student participant with WP once
again for the GSoC 2008.  Over the past year, I have become deeply
interested in both site usability and design.  My idea is to combine these
two growing passions in an effort to analyze and redesign wordpress.org.  I
am aiming to create a fresher look that is professional, but simple and
efficient in delivering its message.  I want to collect input on what people
would like to see in the new site look and also make sure that the site is
structured in such a way that it is user-friendly.  The site is powerful and
contains a wealth of great information, but I want to make sure the average
person accessing it leaves with the information they intend to retrieve.

Please let me know any thoughts, improvements or suggestions you have for
this intended proposal!  Thank you all for your time and I hope to have a
chance to display my work to the WordPress community.

Regards,
-Corey

Hi Corey,

I'm excited to hear that you are looking to participate again this
year in GSoC with WordPress -- have you grabbed 2.5rc1 and are taking
it for a spin?

I don't think that will be a successful application. Although last
year we accepted some applications that weren't focused on software
development, this year we will be even more focused on the C in GSoC,
because frankly software development is the expertise of the mentors
and the projects progress and successes are much more easily measured
if focused on code.

You will be happy to know that Matt Thomas and team have been working
on a redesign of WordPress.org .

Hope that helps,

Hi Lloyd,

Haven't gotten my hands on 2.5 yet, looking to do so soon though!  Thanks
for the feedback!  I will take a look at the projects being offered more
closely and see if there are any there, or anything that I come up with that
could be a successful coding project for the SoC :)

A quick solution would be to distribute the library four times, but
only load it once.

If the library is JS, use the wp_print_scripts function or if it is
PHP, use an include but only include it some constant is not set.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Tests: Automated Hourly Test Runs
Message-ID: <47DFF93B.8000002@santosj.name>

I've finally gotten around my hosts server issues and was able to get 
all of the unit tests to run correctly. It is a fun little site to see 
how many tests passed, how many failed, and how many errors there were, 
except not in that order.

Green = Tests that Passed
Yellow = Errors
Red = Tests that failed

The tests run hourly, but takes about 30 minutes to complete, so look 
for it every hour and a half. There is one other feature I've yet to 
implement and I have to get the Tests working for WordPress Mu, (Which 
will probably involve manually including the tests classes that are 
known to work, however probably should just skip those, so that I don't 
have to update the system when WordPress Mu 1.5 comes out).

Let me know what you think. You can't get the results of what tests had 
errors or failed. I might add that later, but I have another project 
that clones this one that will allow you to get that information. I 
think it would be useful, but I'm unsure how much more time that would 
add to the process and I would also have to write something that imports 
that to a database. I find that boring.

http://wordpress.svn.dragonu.net/WPTests - Subversion Code. You won't 
have access to the run-tests folder (hopefully this doesn't mean I can't 
access it either. Meh, Can always add Allow directive later.)

Requires PHP5, host that allows running of extremely long processes. 
Also requires PDO_SQLITE extension be loaded.
You have to set up the cron jobs.
Ignore WordPress2.php and WordPress3.php, they were there for batch 
running of the tests. I might still support that, since it could be 
useful, but it requires that the index be updated again.

http://wptests.dragonu.net - Demo web site. You don't have access to the 
actual WordPress site, which is on trunk and updated hourly also. If you 
want to see the live demo, then it is located somewhere else.

This is only a proof-of-concept and is by no means representative of 
WordPress stability or usability in any way. The current test suite does 
not cover the full code coverage of the WordPress library. Failed tests 
does not necessary mean that WordPress will not run. Some of the failed 
tests are feature requests and does not accurately test the original 
intent or design of the function.

I offer no warranty to the code in WPTests repository and I can not 
offer any support. Use with caution. License is the same original 
WordPress Tests license, since major code portions are derived from the 
Automattic WordPress Tests Suite code base.

Any additions to the testcase needs to be sent to Alex Shiels of 
Automattic. He is pretty good with adding test cases.

Thanks. Finally, you know I've had so many projects bouncing around in 
my head, I was thinking I would go insane. It is nice to finally have 
one partially finished.

Oh yeah, Nikolay, this is what I was talking about, when I said I would 
like something like this on wordpress.org. I do believe that with as 
many tests as the Test Suite has now, that it is worth having an 
automated site.

Are these different tests than what Alex put together at http:// 
svn.automattic.com/wordpress-tests ?

After tweaking things I was able to finally get those tests to run.   
I put together a simple process that runs an arbitrary commands (in  
this case the unit test code) against each revision of wordpress - 
trunk.  The results could then be compared across each revision,  
making it easy to pin down which revision broke something.

I'm still getting familiar with the unit test code so I haven't put  
this out live anywhere.

I've seen reported to wp-testers a number of bugs related to browsers
in beta. It seems they come and go from one browser beta to the next.

I don't think it can be expected that everyone testing WordPress in
beta browsers be capable of determining whether a fault exists in the
browser or in WordPress or a third-party library.

Someone must at least triage these and submit the tickets to the
appropriate bug trackers.

If you are a capable WordPress hacker and you already run beta
browsers, please keep your eye out for these reports.

Message-ID: <eff2e86c0803181300x30b2e954l445cff0088f67b8f@mail.gmail.com>

Here is my second project proposal. I'll see how this one does, and I will
probably crank out at least another proposal before the application
submission period begins.


* Abstract *


An often requested feature for WordPress has been OpenID support. Why is
OpenID such a popular request? Well, OpenID allows users to maintain a
single identity online. Users of OpenID can use the same login across
multiple websites, making signups and logins more convenient. Since blogs
often require users to register, OpenID makes a logical solution for quick
and secure signups.


However, the bigger question is what would OpenID bring to WordPress?


- OpenID would allow for faster commenting (only need to fill out one field)
for any user with an OpenID.


- Registration would be quicker and less painful. Users would only have to
enter their OpenID identifier and they would be registered for that
WordPress website.


- OpenID would help ease the spam issue. Bloggers could disallow anonymous
comments, but allow commenting without registration through OpenID.


- Every WordPress.com user already has an OpenID Identity, thus
WordPress.com users would have a quick and easy registration option on new
blogs.



* Solution *


- Add OpenID support as a core patch.


- Allow users to register a WordPress user account using OpenID.


- Allow existing users to add their OpenID login to their account, allowing
future OpenID logins (This would also allow admins to login into WordPress
with OpenID).


- Hook into the existing comment form, so themes do not have to support an
additional input field. A separate field could be offered as an option.


- Provide an option for blog admins to make their WordPress blog their
OpenID identity, at least through the passthrough method of the
openid.server <head> <link> tag. Possibly making WordPress an identity
server if time allows.


- Allow OpenID support to be enabled or disabled on a blog, with the default
state chosen based on community feedback.

Is there any plugin for revision control in a page? Drupal and Wikimedia
have such system, so author can revert to some version or show the diff. Is
it ok to propose this system for GSoC 2008?

Although it is a provocative proposal, I wonder if it is sufficient
scope. Last I checked, the existing WordPress plugins for related
experiences are pretty polished.

The proposal may be a bit better if used the domain terminology. In
this case, relying party (consumer) and Identity provider or OpenID
provider.

Although, likely to spark a holy war, my biggest problem is OpenID,
other than having big buzz points, doesn't solve an experience problem
for most WordPress participants, and those that it does are well
served by a plugin. Most blogs do not require registration or comment
verification [sic] , nor do I buy the argument that OpenID can have
any significant benefit in the fight against spam. Currently, using
OpenID on any site is pretty awkward and the experience is phishing
fear focused.


Hope that helps,

I'm quite new here but my 2 cents:

I think the scope of that feature might be a little too big for a SoC
student to take on in one summer. Expecting someone to become familiar
with the code, take a feature like this through the requisite design
discussions, reach a suitable plan and then implement and test it
might take a bit longer than the ~4 months of summer.

Maybe building on top of the blicki plugin that Andy mentioned would
be a good start?

I have to point out that there are post versioning pugins available
for WordPress:

http://rephrase.net/days/05/04/post-versioning
http://watershedstudio.com/portfolio/software-development/wordpress-versioning-plugin/#download

We did improve the plugin quite a bit in the past few months for a
specific need, but it can be adapted to be released to the public
after polished.

Excellent points, Lloyd. However, I tend to look at this from a different
viewpoint.
While a blog administrator can take advantage of OpenID by installing a
plugin, not many do. The mass majority of WordPress blogs do not have any
OpenID support, and that disadvantages the OpenID user. An OpenID user can
not install OpenID on any blog they wish; that option is up to the blog
administrator. So, if I come across Joe's Blog and I want to comment, my
option of using OpenID is limited to if Joe installed a completely optional
plugin. By having OpenID support built right into WordPress, the number of
OpenID capable WordPress blogs would skyrocket.

And while yes, the spam argument is kind of moot, and most websites do not
require registration, the websites that do are a pain to deal with. I would
much rather enter in my OpenID then go through the whole registration
process.

I've also worked a bit on a revisioning system:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-revisions/

I can't imagine it works at all right now, though, since it was  
designed to work with WordPress development code somewhere inbetween  
2.3.3 and 2.5.

There's been some talk about making revisioning a core feature in 2.6.

Been looking at the upcoming WordCamp Dallas

I'm not aware of a WordCamp taking place in the UK - I've had a look through 
http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/29/what-is-wordcamp/ 
to check.

Pehaps someone on the hackers or testers list could clarify if there's been such a gathering in the UK?

If not would a WordCamp London be a good idea? 

I propose London as a venue due to transport links, accomodation etc but would be open to an alternative UK location.

If there is interest I'd be happy to take part in the organisation of such an event.

What does everyone think?

Akeda,

I am just wrapping up a plugin that works with modern versions of  
WordPress. It's based on an old Blicki (Blog + Wiki) plugin originally  
developed from the guys at Automattic. There was also a plugin called  
WP-Verioning (http://watershedstudio.com/portfolio/software/wp_versioning.html 
). Again this was a very old plugin that appear to no longer bee  
supports.

I've tested it with version 2.3.1 forward (have not tested under 2.5).  
Unlike the Blicki and WP-Verioning plugins that created separate DB  
tables to store the information I'm using the wp_posts table and  
keeping the versioned item as a special post_type. It appears to be  
very stable. The Versioned items appear on the post/page editor  
screens. Each revision has a link to view (similar to Preview) the  
revision in the theme. Also there is a link for each revision to load  
that previous version into the editor. From here is can be saved and a  
new Revision is created.

If you would like try the plugin I'll be glad to send it to you. I had  
a few more 'features' I'm wanting to add this weekend before posting  
it officially to the repositoory.

blicki is a dead end.  We're considering integrating the Post
Revisions plugin into 2.6.

Glad to hear that it will be considered for 2.6, Ryan.

Sounds like there are enough developers out there working on the same
functions. Probably there can be a concerted effort?

Yep - these seem to have been informal gathering connected with other event - eg

An alternate way, would be to make the library a wordpress plugin in itself, So that users would be notified to updates of that too.
But thats not going to solve the install stuff.

Personally i'd just have the library seperate in svn somewhere, and include it via a svn external link, I *think* the zips created should include any external content, that way you can at least only update one copy of the library.

The other way you could do it, is to package all the plugins together, and just let the user activate one, or all of the plugins.

WordCamp is open source. Feel free to throw your own. Its easier than  
you think. Here's a link to get you started: http://barcamp.org/

I was uninterested in building a continuous integration system, however,
you might want to look at Bitten (same people who develop Trac), which
should allow you to run your process automatically through Trac whenever
there is a new commit. I would very much like a continuous integration
system and I believe I've bought it up on the past.

There is also phpUnderControl, which uses a Java Based continuous
integration system. phpUnderControl is hosted on the same server as
phpUnit and can probably be installed using the same PEAR channel.
Actually, there are installation directions.

I suggest you try out those, before you put any more work into your
solution. Who knows, you might develop a PHP continuous system that beats
all of them down.

I'm not trying to create a continuous integration system. I just found,
like you, a problem and decided to provide a web solution. I sent code to
Alex, but I've since realized that everything I need is already in the
WordPress Test system.

Yes, I am using the Alex Automattic WordPress Automated Test System.

If it's a JS library, you can avoid loading it repeatedly by correctly
using the wp_enqueue_script function to load it.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script


However, regardless of this, I don't see any way to do what he asked
with the repository and the automatic update stuff. The whole point is
that the plugin goes into one sub-folder of the plugins folder. With
four different plugins, you've got four different folders.

Subject: [wp-hackers] OT: htaccess and two domains...
Message-ID: <47E1177F.4080306@gmail.com>

For all you htaccess gurus out there, here's one for you... How can you 
get TWO domains, to act as one, depending on the one you land on? Like...

If user Joe comes in on your domain.COM domain, at like. .. 
domain.com/?p=2 and then you'd want to have the .NET work and take user 
Joe to the same place, just on the .NET, like such: domain.com/?p=2 if 
user Joe went there, he'd be getting the same posts, pages, etc etc 
without getting 404s and etc. Without mirroring and all that too... When 
I had my old host 100megswebhosting.com... they did it for me.

I had TWO domains, taking people to same place... and no matter which 
one they landed on, it was at same place, acting like normal blog 
without 404s...

domain1.com/?p=2 user got post 2
domain2.net/?p=2 user got post 2 same as they would on domain1.com/?p=2

I hope this isn't confusing... but I got back my original domain: 
vindictivebastard.com and instead of having it redirect to the .NET, I'd 
like the .NET and .COM acting together as one blog, just two separate 
domains.

I'm with Lloyd on this one. OpenID is clumsy to work with, does not  
have sufficient user uptake, and is just as much work or more to get  
a site registered with your Identity provider. And I don't buy the  
argument that if there was more OpenID support, there'd be more  
OpenID users.

For those that find OpenID useful, let them be served by the plugins.  
For everyone else, we'll stick to our login form.

I'd like to see some more "frameworks" in the plugin directory, by the  
way.

Also, I remember something like plugin dependencies to be managed in  
the future, I may be wrong but if this is right it might be a way to  
solve this problem.

Message-ID: <B4296C5C-6895-42BB-B7CA-62B9B7A97CF5@tekartist.org>

Hey list,

Am I the only one not being able to use visual editing in 2.5 (latest  
trunk)?

I have "use visual editing" selected for my user, the "Visual" tab is  
selected in the write/edit screen, but the editor I get is the code  
view.

EG: http://i27.tinypic.com/m9njeq.png

Is it just being worked on, or am I having an unexpected issue?

PS: I have disabled all plugins, so I'm running vanilla WP 2.5-bleeding.

Thanks. :)

I should point out here that the goal here should be to improve
WordPress and the experience of the WordPress user. We're not
developing for the OpenID user base.

True, but largely irrelevant. What does OpenID specifically bring to
the table for WordPress? You've made some excellent points already in
your first post, so allow me to rebut those directly:

Faster commenting: Fill in one field instead of two, or three? Seems
thin, at best. And you didn't add how with OpenID, you'll get
redirected to another website which you have to login to or have
cookies for. The user experience of the commenter seems to be enhanced
very little, for these cases. In fact, the user experience in most
cases I've seen is significantly degraded, because now the whole
interface changes when they go off to another site.

Easier registration: Unless OpenID adds a significant amount of user
data that it does not have already, such as the user's first and last
names, display names, etc, filling out a registration/profile is still
required. You cannot one-step-register, even with OpenID.

Spam: False, OpenID does not and was never intended to prevent spam.
OpenID advocates admit this:
http://wiki.openid.net/FAQ#Does_accepting_OpenID_logins_protect_me_from_spam.3F
Also, there has been OpenID spam already:
http://www.google.com/search?q=openid+spam

Give WordPress.com users a way to login: What if I don't want
WordPress.com users logging into my site? I think most people on this
list would agree that most blogs do not allow registration. Blogging
is generally a one-sided thing: you speak, other people listen. The
only feedback is usually in the form of unauthenticated comments. This
is the most common case. What does OpenID add for this case in
particular?

You have to go through the whole registration process anyway, if they
require it. OpenID is not a replacement for registration, it's merely
a replacement for username/passwords.


My vote says to leave it a plugin. An OpenID server integrated into
WordPress would be nice, but it's not strictly speaking necessary.
It's plugin material. I'm using a minor theme mod on mine to delegate
my own OpenID to wordpress.com. Works fairly well, although maybe 40%
of the time the site has a broken OpenID implementation and it doesn't
work at all.

But an OpenID consumer is definitely plugin material, because the
large majority use-case does not seem to require it.

If you want to distribute the library across a few plugins, you could
set up the SVN:externals property, so that you only need to upgrade at
one place and have all the other plugin repositories updated. Just
like what Akismet is doing in the official WP subversion repository.

Details here: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.externals.html

I have not tried it in the WordPress plugin repositories, but only in
my local repositories. Anyone tried this?

No, I don't think you can. WP does internal redirect based on ONE domain.
However, you can set up 301 redirects in htaccess so that domain2.net/?p=2
will automatically redirect to domain1.com/?p=2

I'm trying to implement something like this. Thinking the way to start 
is have the original saved with data/time appended to slug when the new 
version is published.

Sadly, there's zero documentation for this. Two months ago MichealH 
reported "Don't know about the rollback ability, but last I checked it 
does keep revisions in the database. It's just not a completed plugin, 
as far as I know."
And he also wrote "there was a push to use that plugin, in conjunction 
with WordPress, to replace the Mediawiki engine used for Codex. But, 
Barry was able to get Codex Mediawiki upgraded recently, so I'd guess 
not much more work will be done to that plugin." so I guess "Bliki" has 
been orphaned.

WordCamp London / UK sounds like a really good idea and being uk based
is something I would be happy to be involved in - you might even
persuade me to do a talk or something if your lucky.

My personal thoughts on location would be for somewhere that has a good
selection of reasonably priced accommodation and good transport links.
Personally I would recommend trying to stay outside central London as it
can be expensive and maybe picking another large city as the base.

I saw there is a list for XHTML validator, in ideas list, to make sure all
output of WP produces valid HTML. I knew how to hook function in some
filters/actions, but where is the appropriate place for this validator, the
last step of rendering a page, what is it? What kind of output should be

OpenID is cool, but it's useless as an anti-spam measure.

Prefer the venue to be Cornwall but I can't see that happening unless
we do Eden Project! A Wordcamp in the tropical zone - awesome!

Anyway, looks like London to me - I might be able to make but I'll

This is a great concept.  I never even thought of it.  I'm so sold on
revisioning in SharePoint, SVN, Version Cue, etc. that I'll do it
anywhere I can.

I was uninterested in building a continuous integration system, however,
you might want to look at Bitten (same people who develop Trac), which
should allow you to run your process automatically through Trac whenever
there is a new commit. I would very much like a continuous integration
system and I believe I've bought it up on the past.

There is also phpUnderControl, which uses a Java Based continuous
integration system. phpUnderControl is hosted on the same server as
phpUnit and can probably be installed using the same PEAR channel.
Actually, there are installation directions.

I suggest you try out those, before you put any more work into your
solution. Who knows, you might develop a PHP continuous system that beats
all of them down.

I'm not trying to create a continuous integration system. I just found,
like you, a problem and decided to provide a web solution. I sent code to
Alex, but I've since realized that everything I need is already in the
WordPress Test system.

Yes, I am using the Alex Automattic WordPress Automated Test System.

I've been taking a peek at http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5028 and
got a bit confused, so I figured I'd ask here...

It seems like support for a category's last_update_timestamp has
pretty much been removed in trunk. I've tested this out and can
reproduce it as of r7383.

I can't figure out where/how the last_update_timestamp is actually
determined either, or even what it refers to exactly (last post time,
last category edit time, something else?). Anyone have any thoughts?

I'm new, btw. I've been using Wordpress for a couple of months and
just finished a big project using WP where I had to make some custom
plugins and as a result I've become pretty interested in WP dev and
I'd like to help out in some way if I can :)

What do you mean, "support"? By the CSS specification, it will fall back
to sans-serif if it can't find any of the others.

IMO, it's pointless specifying "Bitstream Vera Sans", because on most
Linux systems, it would be falling back to that anyway. Just because we
don't specify it doesn't mean we "don't support" it.

Heck, Ryan Boren apparently develops with Eclipse on Ubuntu (as I do,
too), and Lloyd Budd is also a strong advocate of Ubuntu.

Message-ID: <ab04f6f30803190606k73998739h77955a66dd1ba40b@mail.gmail.com>

I have made a bit of PHP code to pull data(url, linktext and nofollow) from
custom fields to display as a link in my link-out post. Think of it as
something similar to Engadget's "Read" link at the end of every post. Only,
in this one, I've included a php if check to run the rest of the code if
there is data in custom fields (meaning if the current post is a link-out
post). I put the code as linked.php in theme folder. It works properly on
the blog.

What I need, is a way to include this in the RSS feed. I'd prefer not to
have any plugins for optimization reasons, even if that means longer
procedure.

Thanks in advance,

There would obviously be at least one more, so the question would be "how

I'm with Lloyd on this one. OpenID is clumsy to work with, does not

a site registered with your Identity provider. And I don't buy the  
argument that if there was more OpenID support, there'd be more  
OpenID users.

For those that find OpenID useful, let them be served by the plugins.

WP is currently focused on being a blog and/or a CMS. It still has some ways to go before it's perfected these fields - IMHO it's not the "ideal" time to introduce wiki-like features, esp. when there are more important things to consider....

Just my two cents.

Just point both VirtualHosts to the same DocumentRoot. If both are in 
the same webspace, you could also try mod_rewrite. I don't think pure 
.htaccess can help you here.

There's a plugin that does this: http://putzlowitsch.de/123-multihost/
I don't know if he has an English version, too, but you might want to
ask him.

Or, maybe this one is for you: http://mcaleavy.org/code/domain-mirror/

If you want to redirect them, honestly, this is better done using a 
ServerAlias directive for your VirtualHost in your apache conf (if you can):
<VirtualHost XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:80>
       ServerName domain.com
       ServerAlias www.domain.com
       ServerAlias domain.net
       ServerAlias www.domain.net
       ...
</VirtualHost>

I have a couple posts on some redirects that I've set up ( 
http://xavisys.com/tag/htaccess/ ).   It could be really easy depending 
on your audience, and whether you use SSL or not.  If you use SSL, 
especially if you have mobile users that are using SSL, then read those 
posts.  If you don't, you can redirect like this:
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^preferreddomain.com$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://preferreddomain.com/$1 [L,R=301]
</IfModule>

That will pass on any url parameters to the preferred domain.

As you said, the goal should be to improve the experience of the WordPress
user.

For a good normal-user perspective, I recommend reading "Why OpenID" at
<http://openid.yahoo.com/>.  For many "normal" users, ID management is an
onerous, persistent and frustrating problem that the WP developer community
can either be proactive about or not.
 
Whether it's a plug-in or not doesn't seem as relevant as whether it's
part-and-parcel of WP or not.

If you set them up as "parked" domains, then all you have to do is
filter all WP calls to the siteurl and blogurl and replace the "set"
domain with the one the user is currently on.

add_filter('option_home', 'fix_link',1);
add_filter('option_siteurl', 'fix_link',1);

function vfix_lins ($link){
$url = str_replace(array('www.','./'),'',$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']);

	$link = preg_replace('/(http.*?\:\/\/w*\.*)(.*?)(\/.*)/','${1}'.$url.'${3}',$link);
return $link;
}

I believe you need to change the domain configuration in the server,
using functionality that is not available to .htaccess.  Probably by
changing the vhosts (if Apache) to point to the same directory for
different domain names...  After you have gotten that part down
(either by yourself or through your webhost) you might need a plugin
like this: http://mcaleavy.org/code/domain-mirror/ that will create
correct links based on the requested domain name.

Ben,

I'll offer my version of the Blicki plugin if you would like to  
review. As I mentioned previous in this thread it's somewhat based on  
the Blicki and wp-versioining plugins. Once important differece is my  
version uses the wp_posts table not a new table. When the 'save_post'  
is executed the plugin will simply capture the post information and  
INSERT a new record into the wp_posts table. The post_type is set as  
'_versioning'. Also a postmeta record is added for this newly inserted  
posts. The postmeta value contains the version number

Under the Post/Page editor you will see something similar to the  
following section http://screencast.com/t/0vgz1w9kX

The user can click on the 'View Revision' link under the item and see  
the themed output in it's orignal format. Also, the user can click the  
'Load this Revision in Editor'. This will copy the post_content  
information and reload the editor page. No DB information is  
manipulated for this action. In other words the plugin is not  
attempting to 'rollback' or switch out the versions. At this point if  
the user saves the reload content it simply creates the next version.

Simple enough.

Things I need sot add are copy all wp_post fields like Title, Excerpt,  
etc. The plugin only reloads the post_content field.

I'm also working on a Revision tool for attachments. Mostly this is  
for my clients who post revised PDF documents etc. They want the  
ability to uplaod the new version but not change the Page links.

I'm making my beta version of the plugiin available for use or review.  
I'll be posting it to the official plugin repository in the coming  
week. Though if WP 2.6 is coming with Versioning built-in what is the  
point really.

No, it is broken for me. If I turn on zlib compression in php.ini it
works. When Andrew comes around I'll ask him about it.

Hi Stephane,

Do you see any js errors in the error console? Could be as simple as 
cleaning your browser's cache. If not, can you try Firefox 2 with 
Firebug and look for js errors or files that couldn't be loaded (in the 
Net tab, red 404s).

Also point your browser to:
siteurl/wp-includes/js/tinymce/tiny_mce_config.php

It should be a large js file starting with "var tinyMCEPreInit" and 
ending with "tinyMCE.init({mode:...".

Thanks.

Actually, that's exactly the point of OpenID, many sites exchange
information like that via attribute exchange:

If there was greater openID support, it might put pressure for their
to be more identity providers, and for existing providers to improve
their services.  (I've disabled the plugin because of the number of
people complaining that their wordpress.com identities don't work)

I made up my mind on what I REALLY want to do now. I haven't emailed my 
old host, forget about that. I going to use the above plugin there... 
and I'm going to use the .COM as the main domain, install 2.5 on that 
one. Upload .NET themes  / plugins to the .COM ftp directories for 
them... I'm going to ADD the posts, comments, etc etc from the .NET one 
to the .COM database ... make it like it's BEEN THERE all along 
originally as it's own site...

Well, I could just make a copy of the VB.net database... change urls to 
VB.COM throughout it... create new database for VB.COM... then do that 
domain-mirror stuff... Or, redirects like Aaron said in his email.. *

Hello,
What is the general consensus among the members of this list concerning
premium themes and plugins for sale? *

Placing the whole licensing debate aside*, how do you feel about those who:

   - Are quite apt at programming
   - Have opted to do so within an opensource arena (like WP)
   - And then seek to profit (by selling their code) rather than
   contribute back (by publicly releasing their code)?

I'd love it in core because setting it up via a plugin is in fact
pretty difficult thing to do. I'm pretty good, and the standard plugin
wouldn't work for me. Also I doubt it would even be that tough to work
in, as Wordpress.com already has support for it (I think).

I personally have no problem pushing a technology into core that is
emerging and can only become more prominent. It is worth noting that
it is already baked into a number of other blogging platforms.

All the best

That sounds good too! Dang, I keep getting these emails late! Where 
would I add the above falling code, if I were to take that route? Two 
separate files, or ... and, will that specific code above work right, or 
how would it need modified in order for it to work?

Or, am I just better off installing WP 2.5 on VB.COM, using a modified 
copy of VB.NET's database (with .net links changed to .com throughout 
it, giving VB.COM an exact copy of .NET currently..) Then using this 
domain-mirror plugin, or 301 htaccess redirects like the other Aaron 
said... ?

I'm not aware of a WordCamp taking place in the UK - I've had a look through 
http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/29/what-is-wordcamp/

Pehaps someone on the hackers or testers list could clarify if there's been such a gathering in the UK?

If not would a WordCamp London be a good idea? 

I propose London as a venue due to transport links, accomodation etc but would be open to an alternative UK location.

If there is interest I'd be happy to take part in the organisation of such an event.

This is absolutely the way to do it. All you have to do is add a
ServerAlias, and then WordPress' Canonical URLs feature will
automagically redirect you.

You don't need to do _anything_ else. No .htaccess redirects, no
nothin'. Just the ServerAlias.

If I remember correctly, Spencer uses DreamHost. You can't edit the
Apache config, but you can add domains that "mirror" another domain
exactly, which is basically the same as ServerAlias.

I think according to the GPL... if the user does the "linking", then it's
fine.

(I.e., you could NOT distribute a commercial theme or plugin with
WordPress.  But if the user or someone else uploads it into the "plugins/"
or "themes/" directory, then it is "fine" according to the GPL.)

Ok, well...when I was hosted on 100megswebhosting.com servers before.. 
and I had vindictivebastard.com and twisted-society.com BOTH leading 
people to the SAME site. They set up VB as the main site on their 
account, twisted-society.com was a secondary domain on account, pointing 
to VB's IP address or server path or something...

Cause, BOTH domains took users to the SAME site.. and when reading 
posts, posting comments, etc etc.. it worked on BOTH as it was ONE site, 
ONE database... unless I'm forgetting the exact way it was done.. it was 
a couple years back...

I suppose I COULD setup a WP 2.5 SVN blog on VB.COM, add VB.NET's posts, 
comments, pages, etc etc to VB.COM database... and have TWO of the same 
contents / comments / etc etc just on two separate domains.. but that 
can be messy and confusing.. cause I'd have to post the same posts and 
etc to two separate blogs.... eeeek!

I'm thinking about contacting their support once, see what they did for 
sure... But I do remember when going to twisted-society.com/post/1234 
showed same as vindictivebastard.com/post/1234 .. I'm just trying to 
remember if the databases for the both were in fact separate or not.. 
Or, if I even had a database for twisted-society.com and they had it set 
up so it would just use vindictivebastard.com's some how.. .. crap, I 
think I'm going to email them once....

THIS is probably what my 100megswebhosting.com host did before... I'll 
have to email them once.. I'm currently using VB.COM as a redirect to 
VB.NET.. but I don't like that really.. I don't really want that 
either... VB.COM was and always had been my ORIGINAL FIRST domain for 
the VB title for years... I just lost it to some domain company before.. 
that was trying to charge me 380.00 to get it back.. this was some time 
ago... But apparently they gave up on trying to sell it and left it back 
in the free domain world again... just sucks too, cause VB.NET been 
around for a good while... and most KNOW to go there... I don't want to 
lose visits and etc... dang this sucks..

There has not been a WordCamp in the UK (yet).

.....

WordCamp London / UK sounds like a really good idea and being uk based
is something I would be happy to be involved in - you might even
persuade me to do a talk or something if your lucky.

My personal thoughts on location would be for somewhere that has a good
selection of reasonably priced accommodation and good transport links.
Personally I would recommend trying to stay outside central London as it
can be expensive and maybe picking another large city as the base.

If I've got it correct,  if  "show_last_updated"  is set to TRUE in 
wp_dropdown_categories (or wp_list_categories), then the date of the lastest 
post to that Category should be displayed.  I don't recollect when that 
stopped working, but the report in Trac originated from the Forum thread:

Some stats from the wordpress.com folks might prove enlightening,
since they became an OpenID Provider, I'd be interesting in knowing
how many of their users use it as such, how many openid hits they get,
that sort of thing.

Just thought I'd point out that having the same content available at two
different domain names is HORRIBLE for your search engine rankings. I highly
suggest redirecting one domain to the other as well as enforcing a www or
no-www preference (that's currently done by WordPress) as that counts as two
different domains too.

Thanks, I hadn't seen Bitten before, I'll check it out.

The phpUnderControl site looks like it provides a lot of data.  I  
generally am not a fan of Java (which CruiseControl requires), but it  
might be worth the work.

My goal was a simple process that would run arbitrary commands (with  
the obvious target being the unit tests) for each revision of -trunk  
and optionally do something with the output of those commands.  This  
was a simple task and it is already done.  That said, my few lines of  
PHP is probably not going to beat out the other systems out there :-)

Ok.  I wanted to double check and make sure there wasn't another  
source of unit tests out there that I had missed.

Yes, you're right---about falling back to sans-serif. May be I
should've replaced the word "support" with "enhance" :).

Lucida sans unicode (available by default in Windows), the next font
after Lucida Grande (natively Mac) looks pretty bad in Windows---in my
opinion. So according to me, wp-admin is worst viewed in Windows---as
per the present sequence of fonts in wp-admin CSS file. Also, I'm
wondering what Tahoma is doing there---it sure is not a web font (i.e.
readability: in terms of kerning and such like).

Also Matt has previously said here that he would make an effort to attend
any major WordCamp event wherever it is.  So, if you get the people audience
together and work with Matt on the timing, chances are you'll have a killer
event on your hands...

WordCamp is open source. Feel free to throw your own. Its easier than  
you think. Here's a link to get you started: http://barcamp.org/ 
OrganizeALocalBarCamp

WordCamp is just a BarCamp limited to WP topics.

Orlando is on its second BarCamp: http://barcamporlando.org/
I'll be doing a presentation on Wordpress on one or both days.

I do it all the time. I have written multiple plugins and themes for clients
that don't ever get released. It's quite common.

I've read all the info on OpenID, including that one. I'm still
unconvinced. Let's break it down:

OpenID is essentially a single-logon system. You can login using a
unique identifier (in this case a URL), and have it the same across
several sites. What I'm unconvinced of is what such a thing would add
to WordPress in particular.

There's two aspects to this: Being a provider and being a consumer. In
this case, we're specifically talking about WordPress being a
consumer. For the WordPress blog to give other people than the blog
owner the ability to login to the site via OpenID, or otherwise use
OpenID to authenticate to the site in some manner.

There's two aspects to being a consumer as well:
1. Login/Registration
2. Commenting (anon or not)

For case 1, the idea is that you'll be able to login to the site via
OpenID. This only applies to multi-user blogs, of course, because it
doesn't make much sense for a single user blog (especially if the blog
is also a provider). Being a multi-user WordPress standalone blog is
not the most common use case of WordPress. In fact, I'd say it's an
edge case.

For case 2, the idea is that commenters would be able to use OpenID
instead of filling in name/email/url information, or perhaps instead
of registering altogether.

For the latter case, requiring commenters to register also seems like
an edge case, very few blogs (WordPress or not) require user
registration for commenting. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that
this is an argument against OpenID, as it would encourage requiring
users to register on more blogs, since just having an OpenID does not
obviate the need to register on a site, it just provides a single
sign-on system.

The most common use case is anonymous commenting (really
unauthenticated commenting), and OpenID offers nothing at all in this
case. Filling out one field instead of two, but then requiring an
extra step to login/allow the site to receive your credentials via
OpenID seems like a step backwards. Sure, you can create an OpenID
provider that doesn't have this restriction/requirement, but there are
not any of these that I've found other than the anonymous one
mentioned in this thread earlier.

So, what I'm saying here is that OpenID support only offers help to
the edge cases, as I see them. Furthermore, the only real support
offered in favor of it so far is that it would help OpenID adoption,
which is a) not a WordPress problem and b) not something I really
support in the first place. As such, I don't think it's appropriate
for the WordPress core code itselfk, nor something that WordPress
should devote resources and time towards. Not at this time, in any
case.

>  Whether it's a plug-in or not doesn't seem as relevant as whether it's

On the contrary, this is the same question from two different sides.
Supporting it in the core means, essentially, picking an
implementation and standardizing it. But, making it easier for plugin
systems to support it allows for competition and to let the actual
user base determine what the best implementation is through
popularity.

Look at Tag support, for example. By far, the most popular tagging
plugin was the Ultimate Tag Warrior, and the resulting interface in
WordPress 2.3 bears a striking resemblance to how UTW worked. The
internals are different, to be sure, but the several tagging plugins
developed determined what the users wanted by what they used and stuck
with and that information was used in determining what went into the
core.

As has been noted in this thread already, OpenID is not a particularly
popular plugin. It's not something that WordPress blog owners
generally want and/or use. So it seems like a stretch to say that
putting it in the core at this time makes sense. As Alex said before,
enabling the plugins are not a particularly straightforward task;
perhaps if it was more popular, then the problems would be worked out.

It is not WordPress's place, on the whole, to push "emerging"
technologies. It is WordPress's place to appeal to it's own userbase
and to implement features they want. Not what they say they want, mind
you, but what it is determined that they want through observation.

The best argument for putting something in the core is to make a
plugin for it and make it ubiquitous. When it becomes something that
every blog owner wants and enables, when themes support it by
default... then I'll say it should be in the core. Not before that.

Yes, it makes sense for Yahoo.com, WordPress.com and other huge
identity bases to be OpenID providers, but you haven't made a
connection to how these problems relates to the WordPress software
package.

Sorry, I don't understand what that means.


OpenID doesn't solve any problems for most bloggers or their blog's
participants. If you feel it does, I would love to hear a use case
that affects most WordPress participants.

I would be surprised if the plugin suffers from architectural changes
that are fundamentally addressed by moving it to core. If there are
server configuration complications, it seems more important to spend
the energy on challenging problems like that on auomatic upgrade for
now.

Have you reported your problem on the forum through the plugins

You want more identity providers?!

Did you report the problems with WordPress.com? If you can forward me
any recent tickets, I can look into them. I've worked with engtech a
few times investigating the problems he has encounted.

Just drop that in a new plugin file. I also have a very dangerous
plugin that allows you to eval snippets and add functions for little
things like this.

http://anthologyoi.com/wordpress/plugins/multi-plugin-plugin.html

That "plugin" is officially unsupported and may eat kittens.

Hmm... I'll keep investigating this over the weekend - I'd like to see
if I can track down a revision where it is working.

Yet again, I'm overwhelmed with feedback. Thanks for responding everyone.


Regarding Otto's original comment:


Faster commenting/registration: As this has been mentioned before, yes, it
is faster. A good OpenID identity server will automatically fill out the
remaining details in registration, and once granted permission for a website
to use an identity, will bypass the authorization screen altogether on
sequential logins.


Regarding the redirect taking away from the user experience, I am going to
disagree and say it adds to the experience. The OpenID delegate page should
be a normal and familiar process for anyone using OpenID. It helps bring a
consistent login / registration process to the user, and adds security since
everyone's login page should be unique to them.


Spam: Alright, I agree, that is a moot point and I retract it.


WordPress.com: If you don't want WordPress.com people or any OpenID user to
login to your site, you simply disable OpenID logins.


Alright, I admit, the greatest benefit to WordPress users is that oddball
scenario of a blog that requires registration. And yes, I agree, OpenID
should not be used to encourage registration at all - I hate registering as
much anyone. However, that's exactly my point. For those rare blogs that do
require registration, OpenID is a HUGE benefit to the WordPress user.


I have found amazing blogs posts that deserve feedback yet require
registration. If you're looking for a specific example, Glenn Wolsey used
to. I have run into other websites, but can't think of them at the moment.
Anyway, in nearly all of those cases, I have skipped over commenting. I
simply do not trust a blog of anyone else with my password.


Yes, we could get into the low security, one time password scenario, but to
me, that's out of the question. I'm not going to remember a one time use
password. And if we want to address the security of WordPress, yes, I trust
the current version of WordPress, but we all know, exploits are always out
there, and not everyone updates WordPress. I have already run into a case
where a well trusted website run by a friend had their database compromised,
and changing passwords sucks. I do not want to go through that again.


Anyway, back on topic, yes, it's a small amount of blogs, but for those
blogs, the benefits of logging in via OpenID is completely worth it to me,
even if that only happens once out of every 10,000 blogs.


As Charles said, identity management is a huge problem for people. If
WordPress could become more convenient in this area, why not? As I've
already mentioned, having just a plugin does not do a whole lot in this
area. Most sites will not have an OpenID plugin installed, so logging in via
OpenID barely occurs, simply because it's not widely supported as an option.
Give people that option and it may become more widely supported.


I also agree with the fact that WordPress' should not be trying to promote
OpenID. I do not want to force OpenID on anyone; I simply want to provide it
as an option. Should I take on this project, I plan to make OpenID support
completely optional. In fact, I'm down for having it disabled by default. I
would certainly love to have it enabled, but if that's what it takes, that's
what it takes.


In addition, I do not really plan to make OpenID an in your face kind of
experience. Besides the options, nothing would have to be done on the visual
side of WordPress. Sure, it would be nice on the login forms to let people
know OpenID is an option, but that can be completely skipped if the general
opinion is avoid promoting OpenID in anyway. The core users of OpenID would
eventually come to know that most WordPress blogs support it, and that would
be fine.


I guess, what I'm curious to know is what disadvantages would core OpenID
support bring? If there are options to completely disable it, how would
someone be affected? The performance impact of OpenID support would be low,
only requiring extra code run on login/logout, the visual branding of OpenID
could be skipped, so no affects there. Is is just people do not like the
standard and do not want to see it more widespread? As I've mention, I only
plan to offer this as an option. I don't want to force OpenID down anyone's
throat.


And Otto, I'm going to have to disagree that OpenID is not something
WordPress users want or use. Just look at the forums. There are requests
left and right for OpenID. The Idea's list is littered with multiple topics
requesting OpenID. Nearly all of these comments say an OpenID plugin is
good, but what we really need is core OpenID support.


By the way, if anyone has any questions about OpenID or feels it's not
secure / properly thought out, listen to Security Now Episode 95. It really
explains the technology wonderfully: http://www.grc.com/sn/SN-095.htm

I just wanted to add that prior to this discussion, I was a strong believer in OpenID; and would have killed to have it added to WP.....
But from the arguments seen made and the questions raised, I no longer believe that OpenID is the answer; nor am I that excited over the prospect of it being added to the core.

For what it's worth: I added OpenID support to my blog for maybe two months, and I had a total of maybe 15 comments whose authors elected to use the OpenID features. The (many) rest just used the old name/email thing; and that pretty much made me remove it......

Subject: [wp-hackers] Second editor instance
Message-ID: <1206004947.5378.5.camel@localhost>

Hi,

I have the following problem:

I'm writing a plugin for WP 2.5 that inserts a second editor on the page
editing page, using the function the_editor(). The relevant code is:

--- SNIP ---
function spsi_editor()
{
  ?>
    <div id="spsi_editorcontainer" class="postarea">
      <h3><?php _e('Secondary content', 'spsi'); ?></h3>
      <?php the_editor($mystuff, 'spsi_content', 'content', true, 3); ?>
    </div>
  <?php
}
add_action('edit_page_form', 'spsi_editor');
--- SNIP ---

It looks ok at first sight, and it works ok when visual editing is
disabled. But in WYSIWYG mode, there are problems: In the second editor,
the iconbar is missing until "visual" is clicked. Then, the editor
instances seem to interfer, both seem to be damaged (especially
switching from visual to HTML mode), although basic WYSIWYG operations
work.

I wonder: are these bugs, have I done something wrong, or is it simply
impossible to have two editor instances on one page?

Tested with r7402 in FF 2.0.0.12/Linux.


Regards,
Alex

Hi Alex,

I think if you call the_editor() more than once on the same page, it 
will insert tags with the same IDs, so the js will get confused.

Perhaps append another textarea on the page and add a button to bind 
TinyMCE to it too, or you can make it bind on page load. Then you will 
have 2 editors that look the same, but save to 2 different textareas.

If you want them to be different, start the second one with another init 
array. See the documentation here:
http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Index

I definitely agree we need such a system, however there is just one
thing missing in the current one -- the names of the failed test
cases.

The purpose of such a system is to free you of the 20-minute waiting
the test to run on your computer. Although I like the colours, the
information there isn't very useful for me -- I want to see, which
test cases were broken after the last commit and fix them. Now, in
order to see the failed tests I have to run them on my machine, which
defeats the purpose of the system.

Thanks for the good work and happy hacking,
Nikolay.

Thanks for your suggestions.

As for the instance, I would expect that the_editor() creates an
independent instance, as it explicitly asks for the id for the textarea
(second parameter), and based on that, it should be possible to create
an independent "namespace". It just seems that some features are
hardcoded to the default instance, such as the switcher between visual
and HTML mode.


Kind regards,
Alex

Might have to go back to 2.1 and look at the get_categories function in 
wp-includes/category.php where it tests $include_last_update_time.

Thanks for the replies.
I regularly take freelance jobs for clients that involve charging for theme
/ plugin development.
The reason I asked this question was to get a feel for buisness models like
wpremix_com, premiumthemes_net, or premiumnewstheme_com (of which I have no
affiliation).

Part of me wants to capitalize on such a model, the other part of me wants
to avoid it altogether and generate revenue on donations or requests for
proposals from the traffic.

I guess it all goes back to what one's primary goal for developing under the
WP platform is: money or contribution to the community. Maybe it's not so
black and white, but thanks for the responses anyway.

The main disadvantage, in my opinion, is that if it was in the core,
then more people would use it and require registration on their blogs
in order to comment. Since I will not register to leave a comment
(regardless of whether they use OpenID or not) I would be unable to
leave comments on more blogs. Especially when the lie about OpenID
"preventing spam" becomes prevalent, which would happen despite
everybody's best efforts.

I do not see an authentication system as actually desirable for the
specific case of commenting. I do not want to authenticate my identity
in order to leave a comment. This is an extra unnecessary step that
should not be promoted under any circumstances.

The standard is fine. The use case you're suggesting for that standard is not.

OpenID is a sign-on system. I do not want to be required to sign-on to
comment on somebody's blog entry. Period. This is regardless of what
methodology is used to accomplish that sign-on.

Plugins are optional too. Roll a better plugin, make a better
implementation, make it popular first. Then it would be suitable for
inclusion in the core.

A vocal minority is not indicative of the whole.

Define exactly how core support is better than a plugin. Why do you
want it in the core and not in a plugin? This makes no sense to the
rest of us.

If it's just because you think more people will use it, then that is
the same argument I will use against putting it in the core. I don't
want more people using it. It's being used in an incorrect manner for
this case.

I must disagree with this point.

Unless I misread previous posts, no one is suggesting that OpenID be forced down all users & readers throats.
All the OpenID plugins for WordPress currently out there don't focus on OpenID as a *sign-on* mechanism so much as a authentication/ID-verification method. You have the _option_ of positively identifying yourself via the OpenID architecture, or posting/commenting/logging-in the traditional way.

Clean trunk checkout did the trick, although I did have to force a  
cache refresh (which didn't work in the older install).
PS: no server-side cache was enabled.

I had been running this checkout (and  updating daily) since last  
september, so it's overall not that surprising. :)

All seems good now. Now, to integrate my plugin with TinyMCE 3. ;)

Thx.

the JS error I was getting.

While reading the GPL and FAQ, I've come to the conclusion that in order 
to legally, without any ambiguously edge cases, is to just release your 
code dual licensed or at least one that allows the user to legally use 
your code in GPL environment.

I think the big issue is that, for the user, your license stands above 
all. So if you have CC with links back and the user removes that because 
the code is now under the GPL, then they've violated your license in 
order to be compatible with the GPL. You have to say in your license 
that it is okay to use your plugin or theme under GPL if and only if the 
original license is not violated.

If you were going to release your theme with WordPress (officially or 
unofficially) then it would have to be GPL.

Also, since the majority of the theme uses the code in WordPress and is 
loaded as WordPress, the code will have to have a GPL compatible license 
in order to be distributed. You can still dual license YOUR code, but in 
order to be completely legal, you would have to build a bridge that 
disassociates your code from the WordPress code. WordPress automatically 
includes functions.php, therefore you can license functions.php in your 
theme any way you want, so basically, the user is paying for 
functions.php and the design.

You can still like sell your code with dual license, but as soon as it 
hits the WordPress execution, it will become GPL code with its 
restrictions on what your license can legally restrict and still be 
compatible with GPL. Meaning, if you have a requirement that a link goes 
back to your site, then it may or may not be enforceable. However, if 
you have a license that states that the user can not redistribute the 
code, then the other license would take effect, Since the first license 
should take precedence, because you are the copyright holder and 
therefore have a say on how your other code is distributed.

That is what I got from the FAQ, possible loopholes, and discussion. The 
fact remains clear that all code that works with WordPress must at least 
be compatible with GPL in some way. Anything else is borderline with 
legal speak.

there seems to be some caching voodoo going on regardless of wp_config 
settings (I see some files appearing in /tmp); I  also get random php 
crashes and errors that look like php didn't get to read files 
completely, but it may be from my laptop's setup (gentoo ~x86, php 
5.2.6_rc1-r1 + xdebug 2.0.2), I have yet to test on my server, which is 
running a more stable system.

good luck; now that there is more information in the codex it should be 
a bit easier ;)

I think the whole problem is that in the web environment, the terms used 
in the GPL or at least in the FAQ do not apply in the web environment, 
so there is enough loopholes to probably argue that you don't have to be 
GPL, but there is also enough language to say that you do have to. 
Either way, the GPL was not written for web or network like languages 
with some of the terms used.

Therefore, if it is your code, you can license it however you want, but 
if you want it to be used in GPL code, your license has to be compatible 
with the GPL, that much is clear. So if you sell your code or demand 
link backs, do expect a huge debate and ethic arguments from people who 
do not agree with your position.

I personally, do hope to one day build a plugin good enough to be sold, 
so that one day, I can actually make money. However, I'm not in the 
legal field, nor do I have an opinion either way (and my opinion doesn't 
matter anyway). I would just call your theme a theme and only 
differentiate it by how much it costs.

If you think about it, you aren't selling the code, but your time and 
services. Therefore, the code might be free, as in open source, but 
people will still have to pay you and in that field, you are entitled to 
accepting a fee, but if someone is paying for your theme, you can not 
expect them to link back to your site, unless they feel your theme is 
good enough for that.

If someone paid you to develop a theme for the sole purpose of putting 
links back to their site, then you are a spammer and hopefully will be 
hunted down like a dog and "handled."

Until there are legal battles to settle the loopholes and what is 
acceptable and what is not, then it is most definitely up in the air, 
from what I've interpreted of the FAQ. I'm not smart enough to 
understand the actual GPL text. That part I do know.

Go read the license at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html and see 
what it says:

a) Any work derived all or in part from GPL work must still be GPL 
licensed. This includes plugins and themes that use any code from GPL 
plugins or themes, or from the Codex.

b) Anyone can distribute copies of GPL software for any price they 
want to, including for free. So you can sell your GPL plugin/theme, 
but your users can re-distribute it for free. You are under no 
obligation to distribute GPL software.

c) Anyone can modify GPL code, as long as the copyright and license 
remain in the code, along with a note stating you modified it, and it 
remains GPL-licensed.

I don't believe there is a theme in existence that doesn't contain 
some code derived from another WP theme or from the Codex (e.g. the 
loop code is pretty much standardized and is GPL). So my opinion is 
that all themes must be GPL licensed. There probably also isn't a 
plugin in existence that would escape GPL either, by being completely 
original, but maybe.

Usual disclaimer: I'm not an attorney, consult an IP attorney for a 
more definitive option.

Otto, I want to thank you for your responses. You're really helping me
further develop my proposal.


Regarding the benefits of core support over a plugin, personally I feel
something as heavily integrated in the login process as OpenID belongs in
core. A plugin is not the proper place for something so drastic. Why? Should
an OpenID plugin break on a WordPress upgrade or cease to be supported by
the author, you end up with users who have no way to login to WordPress.


I personally feel that a plugin should be able to be disabled with no ill
effect. Which is why I currently do not use an OpenID plugin, or any plugin
for that matter that would cause problems should I ever have to stop using
it. Something a simple as a plugin that adds [quote] tags to comments I
avoid, because I would have a mess without it.


OpenID is that kind of plugin. Should an OpenID plugin be disabled, you end
up with a mess. Users that have only registered with OpenID have no way of
logging in, and so on. This feature would be better suited for official core
support.


In addition, even if OpenID is disabled by default, just the option makes it
easier for users wishing to login with OpenID. A user would only have to
request for the blog administrator to enable a checkbox, instead of finding
a plugin and then configuring it.


Now in regards to encouraging comment registration, I am rethinking the
implementation of OpenID. I do not think comments should be authenticated
with OpenID. I wouldn't use it, and I certainly would not want to encourage
using OpenID over anonymous comments.


I am thinking should OpenID support be added to core, it should only be
added to the registration and login process, nowhere else. Blogs that have
registration enabled could benefit from the use of OpenID, and OpenID would
not conflict with the regular comment process. If a user wished to use
OpenID, they just create an account / login with WordPress using an OpenID
login, and WordPress handles the rest. OpenID should have no part in the
comment process, other than authenticating the user login.


Should someone want to authenticate comments with OpenID, that is plugin
territory. With core OpenID support, a plugin would only be adding the
proper fields to make that happen, and that plugin would then fall into the
disable without a problem set of plugins.


How does that sound?


Furthermore, should I take on this project, I'd really like to do core
support, but I would be willing to convert it to a plugin mid-summer (Matt's
suggested core commit date) if there is a mass backlash or major issues.
Although, I don't see that happening. If OpenID is used just for the
existing registration or login process, there is no OpenID encouragement or
encouragement of forced registration of comments. Thoughts?

Yup, http://codex.wordpress.org/TinyMCE_Custom_Buttons is very useful,  
but Viper's video-quicktags plugin did teach me a few tricks of the  
trade to manage integration with TinyMCE 2 and 3, as well as buttonsnap.

All is (on its way to be) well under the sun.

 I may be missing something in my reading of the code of the automatic
plugin update facility but shouldn't it deactivate the plugin before
replacing it with the new version and then reactivate that? How else are
plugins supposed to handle versioning issues? Given the difficulty of the
actual file system code the de/re-activate stuff should be a minor fix.

Nothing stops you from doing both. I was commissioned to write my

Also, just for clarity, there are two very different questions we're
talking about here:

1 - If I make a plugin/theme and it's (conceivably) all original, can
I sell it and stop people from re-distributing it?

2 - If I make a plugin/theme for myself/my_client/grandma_joe, do I
have to give it away for free?

The first is controversial based on how you define originality (i.e.
do API calls disqualify you?). In the end the question is do you want
to take the person who re-posts it to their blog saying it's GPL to
court. (An interesting case being the ShortStat plugin, which was
erased from the web after it became the commercial 'Mint' product, but
was picked up by a developper and continued as a WP plugin).

The second I believe is non-controversial and allowed under the GPL.
If you don't re-release it then you can do whatever you want with GPL
code, only re-published versions need to make the modifications
available. (of course like Jenniffer IANAL).

Message-ID: <485dd1460803201113g72d87bcbg5e4ef8104b7869e1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am facing a strange problem with wp_schedule_single_event function when
passing parameters to the callback function.

The following is my condensed code

wp_schedule_single_event(time()+3600, 'my_custom_hook', $data );
add_action('my_custom_hook','my_function')
function my_function($data) {
//print $data
}

My aim is to pass the parameter $data to my_function(), but the above code
is not working for me. The $data variable inside the my_function is always
set to null.

The documentation for the wp_schedule_single_event at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_schedule_single_event says
that we can pass the arguments for the callback function as the third
parameter but it doesn't seem to work for me. Am I missing something here?

I think that's more a comment on the market than the quality of the 
existing plugins, which are quite good.

That sounds good Matt. I will be interesting to see the OpenID usage on
WordPress.com.

I think what's missing here is a true discussion of the value that
OpenID can provide to users (not blog owners, contra Ronald).  What
Automattic has, given their ownership of Gravatar and their use of
OpenID on WP.com, is a chance to become a defacto identity provider.
If you can manage what information about you is exposed to any given
site by simply pointing to your OpenID (avatars, email, full name,
etc.) AND Matt, et al. manage to put a nice frontend on the whole
process, well, that's pretty compelling.

As to how that redounds to WP.org and the core WP product, well, you tell me.

Maybe you can put a link to that plugin's home page in the appropriate 
section of the Codex page, so others can learn from it too?  It never 
hurts to have extra examples. :)

It sounds like you'd have to do a hell of a lot of work to separate
comments from registration.

Like it or not, it's not that simple. Mere inclusion of OpenID as a
registration would have the effect of encouraging registration-only
comments and discouraging anonymous commenting. You don't need to
allow OpenID on comments to get that effect. The masses will hear
"OpenID prevents Spam" and voila. It's not true, but there's a lot of
things that aren't true that people believe. Look at how many people
think that Disabling SSID Broadcast on a wireless access point makes
it more secure. Look at how many people will *argue with you about it*
when you tell them that they're wrong and explain why.

The commenting system is generally tightly integrated with the user
login. Most themes have something to the effect of "when the user is
already logged in, don't display the name/email/url boxes". If OpenID
was there, then it actually makes sense to check the URL box and log
the user in when there is an OpenID at that URL. Otherwise, you're
letting unauthenticated users spoof possibly authenticated ones.

No, the problem is not solved by merely not enabling OpenID for
comments. The problem is inherent in the idea itself. The idea that
the people reading the blog need to be authenticated in the first
place, that's the problem. Why should the audience be authenticated?
Even when they are providing feedback, it seems like a horrible
invasion of privacy and anonymity to me. I value anonymity, I hate to
see it reduced in such a manner by OpenID.

Now, don't get me wrong. I like OpenID itself. I think it has its
uses. I'd love to login to digg using my OpenID. I'd love to use it to
login to slashdot, or my favorite online forums, or anywhere where I
have a username and an identity that I use on a regular basis.
Anywhere where the discussion is a multi-person forum, not a more
one-way form of communication like a blog is. So, OpenID is fine for
what it does. But it really does not fit the "blog" mold, as far as I
see it.

$data needs to be an array containing the parameters. Like this:

 wp_schedule_single_event(time()+3600, 'my_custom_hook', array($data) );
 add_action('my_custom_hook','my_function')
 function my_function($data) {
 //whatever
 }

If you were to have multiple params, you'd do something like this:

 wp_schedule_single_event(time()+3600, 'my_custom_hook', array($data1,
$data2) );
 add_action('my_custom_hook','my_function')
 function my_function($data1, $data2) {
 //whatever
 }

My bad, that second example should have been this:
wp_schedule_single_event(time()+3600, 'my_custom_hook', array($data1,$data2) );
 add_action('my_custom_hook','my_function',10,2);
 function my_function($data1, $data2) {
 //whatever
 }

I forget the 10,2 bits on the action. Gotta have the 2 for 2 parameters.

Otto, I think you misunderstood my last comment.
I am talking about simply ignoring the way current OpenID plugins use the
URL box for authentication. My revised solution would only integrate OpenID
with the existing WordPress registration/login process. Nothing would be
done on the theme's end.

Essentially, I would be integrating OpenID how it is intended to be, for
accounts, not for comments. If someone is using an account system with
WordPress, OpenID would integrate with that. Completely ignore the comments.
Here is a scenario:

I'm on a blog that requires registration. I click the existing login link. I
enter my OpenID. WordPress logs me in. From there on, the experience is
completely identical to if I had entered a username and password. I'm using
WordPress user accounts to do everything, no trickery with OpenID.

I don't see how this would create more work. If anything, less work. I'm not
changing anything with the way WordPress comments functions. I'm just
allowing users to authenticate with OpenID instead of using a username and
password. Theme's would react the same way a regular user is logged in
because an OpenID user would be a regular user, just authenticated
differently.

I completely agree with you that registration should not be used for
comments. I am completely against comment registration. However, I fail to
see if WordPress allows OpenID logins that everyone is going to flock to
registration only comments. Maybe you'll get a few misinformed users (as
always), but the vast majority of blog administrators hate registration as
well, and won't enable it.

Regarding spam, that can easily be overcome. Add one simple line under the
option to enable OpenID: Enabling this option allows user to register and
login via OpenID (link to information). Note: This is not a spam
fighting technique.

I would not even place the OpenID option on the comments page to prevent
confusion with spam fighting.

And history has shown that requiring registration can actually make you 
less safe as well.
It is much more likely for there to be a exploitable security issue in 
any software in the administration area which actually allows you to do 
stuff.  A number of the recent WordPress vulnerabilities have only 
easily been exploitable by the people you trust to access your admin 
pages - requiring registration for comments makes this everybody.

Me too.  For me the killer space for OpenID (or something like it) to be 
implemented is the space in which I need to be authenticated and don't 
want to have to remember the login information that is so difficult to 
remember that I have to write it down.  OpenID style authentication is 
the sort of things that banks should be using for there login ids.  I am 
not saying that providing an OpenID login is the only thing that should 
use but that is how I should be able to provide my identity.

I just noticed this...

In the documentation for this plugin:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does it count my own hits? =
It does not count the hits of logged in admin users.

In the code:
function stats_footer() {
	global $wp_the_query, $current_user;
	$options = stats_get_options();
	if ( !empty($current_user->ID) || empty($options['blog_id']) )
		return;

It's not just checking for "admin" users, it's checking for any logged
in user. Logged in users, of any stripe, don't count for the stats.
Might not be the best thing for blogs that require registration.

The Affero General Public License was developed to fix this, but I'm not
sure if it's compatible with the GPL (i.e. copy and modify WordPress
functions into your plugin).

I brought this up forever ago around when it was first released, never did get a reply on this matter....

Be interested in hearing the rationale behind this logic.

There's two real cases to be concerned about when trying to sell GPL
code, in general:

1. Selling to the public.
2. Developing specific code for a client.

For case 1, this can get tricky, because any code you sell to the
public they can then give away to other people for free. However, this
is the standard piracy problem, with the side effect being that it's
legal for them to do it. There is no solution to this problem, except
to sell something else. Instead of making code once and selling it
over and over, sell support or customized code or something like that.
Nobody ever said that you could write the killer plugin and then
retire.

For case 2, this is not so much a problem as many people think. If you
develop a theme or a plugin for a client, then that client has the
ability to give away or resell the code, but there's nothing saying
that you have to release it for free. The GPL doesn't make things free
as in beer, it makes them free as in speech. And realistically, the
client doesn't have any particular reason to give away their code,
they paid for it, why should others give it up for free?

The standard answer to selling GPL'd stuff is to sell services instead
of source. Sell custom development, create a web service that does
something people want to use, sell support. Writing something once and
selling it over and over is not a good business plan in the long run,
because you only "own" that code by virtue of laws saying that you do
(copyright law). And those laws can change from place to place and
over time. Copyright won't be around forever. Basing a business model
on intellectual property is not a decent long term strategy.

Actually... this is all you really need to do. WP is going to drive  
off the domain set up in the options. Once the domains are aliased,  
then WP will handle the rest, since all links will lead to which ever  
one you set up as primary.

You only need to get fancier if you worried about Canonical URLs etc.

Thanks for your comment Eric, what was done was... Jeremy Visser helped 
me with some shell shortcuts and we moved VB.NET files over to the 
.COM.. then made .COM database host name...changed that part of

For those of us managing a lot of blogs ... is anyone aware of a page

under 2.5?  I usually update all my users immediately with new  
releases but want to make extra sure I'm not breaking anything this

Unlike WordPress 2.3, there are very few changes in 2.5 that will
break plugins. The few that are broken deal mainly with the admin
panel.

The official plugin compatibility list is here:

Yep, Aaron hit it.  No schema changes that I know of so only plugins
that interact with the IA or aesthetics of the admin area would be
effected.

Any widget plugin that used the multiple copies of the widget method
will probably break. The ExecPHP widget was one of these.

New version is here: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/php-code-widget/

If the users interact with the plugins in admin, be aware that the  
Options (now "Settings") screens might be kind of ugly in 2.5

So I've looked at 2.1.3 and it seems like this functionality was
either intentionally removed (or half-removed, technically) or somehow
lost when the term/taxonomy stuff came in later. The get_categories()
function is now much shorter and hands the work off to get_terms() for
the most part. I'm not too familiar with this whole concept yet, so if
anyone could help me out that'd be pretty cool - I could definitely
use a couple of pointers in the way terms/taxonomy are handled by WP
now.

Also, does anyone remember hearing anything about this feature being
intentionally moved/cut?

Hey Glenn,

You might want to bear in mind that WordPress is not a "democratic" 
project. It's run by Automattic. They have built a business around it 
(they recently raised $29.5m[1]). So I don't think anyone can fault your 
ethics if you choose to profit from WordPress.

Additionally, the code that runs wordpress.com is not publicly available 
as far as I know. I realise it's based largely on WPMU, but to the best 
of my knowledge, many of the plugins and customisations applied are not 
publicly available.

Automattic's primary motivation, by definition of being a business, is 
to make money.

Hey Lloyd,

Is there a process to register as a mentor? Or do I simply add myself to 
the codex page?

Cheers - Callum.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Editing a tag also edits a matching category
Message-ID: <47E381FC.7050000@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

When you edit a category, you are actually editing the term and not the 
taxonomy. This means that if you have a category and a tag with the same 
underlying term, things can get out of sync.

The simplest example is regarding case. If you create a post and tag it 
"photos" then create another post and add a category "Photos", the 
category will be called "photos" because that's the name of the existing 
term with the same slug. If you edit that category and change it to 
"Photos" then the tag will also be changed to "Photos". Likewise, if you 
decide to edit a category slug, it will edit the slug of the 
corresponding tag (if the tag exists), and vice versa.

I think this is a fundamental bug in the term / taxonomy system. I've 
been looking through the code in some detail recently (doing some stuff 
on WPMU) and I've come to the conclusion that tags and categories are 
fundamentally different. For example, in WPMU, tags can easily be used 
globally, while categories cannot. Categories have descriptions and 
parents which might be different on each wpmu blog, tags do not.

I'm not proposing anything at this point. I'm keen to explore what other 
people think on the subject. Anyone have an opinion to share?

Cheers - Callum.

I don't view it as incendiary at all -- it's the plain truth.
Automattic makes money off of services and products based on Open
Source/GPL'd software.   I think Callum was just pointing out that, as
far as such activity goes, there's obvious precedent even in the WP
community, thus if you CAN build a business based upon the selling of
premium themes (that are themselves GPL/GPL-compatible), then there's
no reason not to.

It is not quite true that there are no changes affecting plugins. See:

Someone else already pointed to the official Compatibility list...

This is definitely a bug. Have you reported in Trac?

The categories/tags are just special kinds of taxonomy. However, like you said,
categories do have relationships (parents) between them more than tags do.

For WPMU, to achieve global category is a bit tricky, but you can simply map
every blog to use a single blog's category... We do run a system
similar to that.
If you don't care about relationships between categories, just treat
them as tags
at the global level, which is what WordPress.com is doing...

WordPress itself would not exist if the license of b2 that preceded it 
wasn't GPL.

I think legally these people are in very murky territory -- which is a 
terrible way to try and build a business -- but more importantly their 
ignoring the principles that made the platform they're building on 
successful.

Fortunately, markets work. Numbers I've seen from existing efforts show 
there's not a ton of money there. Enterprising coders have already 
started capturing the best ideas from alleged premium themes and 
releasing it as open source, and people are inspired by that and 
building on those to create new and exciting things. (Much like Regulus, 
Hemingway, Kubrick/K2, and other great WP themes have inspired countless 
derivatives.)

If you take the arguments behind premium themes to their logical 
conclusion, we face a WP world where all new themes and plugins cost 
money, feature development is stagnant because everyone just contributes 
their ideas to their paid plugins, and both become user-hostile as they 
attempt to cut down on "piracy."

The most successful models over time are those that embrace openness and 
distribution, as WordPress has done.

It's not a matter of work being valued or not, or making money. I've met 
hundreds of people who make their living on top of WordPress. Automattic 
has done quite well yet does not shy away from the GPL. It's a matter of 
investing in long-term growth of the community and underlying platform 
instead of short-term and limited profit.

I don't think it's worth it to bother people attempting to exploit the 
flawed premium plugin/theme model. Economics will sort them out over 
time. Their heart is in the right place even if they're methods are 
flawed. As a community we should not promote them on our official sites, 
but more importantly we should reward those doing the right thing.

Browse down your plugin list, look at the theme that made you look like 
a rock star. Visit the author, and give something back.

Tell them thank you, write a blog post about them, hunt down their 
Amazon wishlist, send them paid work you hear about, tell your friends 
about them, visit them at conferences and shake their hand, support 
other ventures they're doing, or if you can't do any of that maybe drop 
a bit in their Paypal donation box.

You can do what Mark did and take what you were going to spend on a 
proprietary thing and donate it to the open source effort:

http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0

It works. (Or we wouldn't be here today.)

There's nothing I love more than meeting people whose living is derived 
from WordPress -- it's a true testament to what we've all created that 
so many can provide for themselves and their families. The best of these 
people invest back in the underlying platform so in the long-term their 
business is stronger.

> Automattic's primary motivation, by definition of being a business, is

And it does, but Automattic is set up in a way to align the economic 
incentives with community benefit, and the way we do this is through 
embracing the GPL. The benefit to you is millions and millions of 
dollars invested into development of the platform we all use for free.

Ask yourself: Is WordPress better off than it was two and a half years ago?

A GPL software community is like the environment. Yes you could make 
profit building widgets in your widget factory and not pay any heed to 
the forests you're clearing or the rivers your polluting, but in a few 
years you're going to start to deplete the commons, and your business 
and public perception will be in peril.

(We can all think of "open source companies" who have done this.)

Contrast that with sustainable development, with giving back to the 
community that sustains (and ultimately consumes) your services and you 
have the makings of something that could be around for generations to come.

The vision I have for WordPress is the latter. I want the software to 
flourish across the web and beyond my lifetime.

Somewhere, an animated .gif of an old American Indian chief is
shedding a tear at the beauty of that statement and the outcome of the
Novell/Microsoft "please don't sue us on dubious grounds, oh mighty

Well, I noticed it when building an options page for my recent
plugin.  From what I see all the settings-like pages use tables for
the layout.  They have the class "form-table".

In my view they are displaying and editing tabular data. The table
happens to have just one column for "labels" and one for "data" with
helpful language interspersed.

That's an appropriate use of tables, IMO.

Don't forget the cautionary fable of the anti-table warrior who  
recoded the WordPress calendar code to use div-span soup instead of a  
table. :-)  Oh, the horror.

Yet It might be a nice thing to have some default admin classes and  
css implemented for fieldset, legend, and label. Just to cover those  
bases. Plugin authors may always add their own css to the mix, but  
giving some guidance here could be helpful and cut some plugin css  
cruft.

<fieldset class="form-fieldset">
<legend>I'm a looker</legend>
<input... or <table... blah
</fieldset>

Probably would only be fieldset and legend I would guess. A good  
developer should then probably use class "form-table" if they go that  
way.

Looks like only media upload and profile use fieldset. Legend only  
used in media upload.

Thanks Matt.
I was leaning heavily towards the WordPress business model based on Otto's
argument above. Your response helps to solidify that decision. Regardless of
one's views concerning the licensing debate, if you can contribute back to
the community and profit off of your own skills and services (highlighted by
the contributions) rather than the "product" I think people will respect you
more.  Furthermore, as Otto mentioned, niched products like plugins and
themes will eventually hit end-of-life or be distributed for free by someone
else. Good intention, service, and quality have a way of hanging around much
longer. Unfortunately, not everybody is after respect, contribution, and
long term business plans. Some people want the "easy money" now, burning
bridges as they go. I guess that's something the WP community will just have
to live with.

Anyway, thanks for your input.

I'm surprised some backward-compatible CSS wasn't included in 2.5 so  
that pre-existing plugins' Settings pages would look _relatively_ the  
same as they used to.

Well, yeah, but there are standard HTML elements for forms.  There  
aren't for calendars.

I'm with the "huh?" crowd.  This could have been done with CSS and a  
standard form.

Still, except for goofing up the appearance of older plugins, this is  
NO BIG ISSUE.   :)

Amen to that. You'd be surprised how far a well intended comment or  
thank you goes with us FOSS dudes.

Ultimately most FOSS code is written to solve a personal problem, then  
released hoping to solve it for others,

So knowing the efforts of releasing and supporting open code are  
paying off for the intended target is often all we need to get in  
return.

I use to be an anti-table everything until I realized they do have a
real purpose but I was just over over-reacting to an abuse. But IMHO
tables are for tabular data not including laying out elements.

I view tables as laying out data as opposed to the non-intended use of
laying out elements.

Anyway, I'll ask Tim B. L. about it next time we hang out (I wish).

maybe a library[1] to hide the details of generating settings pages[2] 
would be appropriate? The one I wrote a while ago certainly made my life

It's a legal grey area, especially with plugins.  But leaving that  
aside, you've set it up as "profit OR contribute back".  I posit that  
both are possible, and indeed are not at odds at all.  I'm not a  
supporter of self-destructive altruism.  I wouldn't still be  
contributing my time to WordPress if it was detrimental to my well- 
being.

I won't bore you by reiterating the stuff previous posters have said,  
so here's where the philosophy meets practice:

- Custom plugin development
	You can charge a lot more to develop custom plugins tailored for a  
specific site or company. It's also not very hard to sell them on the  
concept of GPLing the code and releasing it.  Just tell them that it  
will allow people to improve their plugin FREE OF CHARGE, and grant  
them goodwill in the WordPress community.
- Scaling, Security, Community Management
	Again, lucrative.  And the sites that need it are the ones that can  
get your name out there and refer you a lot of business.
- WordPress core development
	More of an investment in yourself.  You can help strengthen the micro- 
market in which you earn your living.  As popular as WordPress is,  
most people have never heard of it, and you are absolutely better off  
making the market bigger and stronger than by building fences and  
trying to stake out your territory.

That's nice!

I think parts of this discussion are "purist" notations about some  
admin CSS declarations for accessible forms. You know some help to  
make them purty while following section 1.3 from this "quick" guideline:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/

But since mostly all fieldsets and legends are removed from 2.5 old  
plugins that followed the previous usage of fieldsets will now get the  
ugly. ( You know you've done it! Copy... paste... change... tada  
plugin option page )

It's not a big deal really. Solution is to provide your own css with  
your settings. A little extra work that many do anyway. You might  
occasionally get a plugin with colliding css, but if you are a style  
purist you should do css class and id declarations unique to your  
plugin.

In other words. Asking for default fieldset legend  classes and css in  
the admin css files is probably just being lazy... ( I admit it! )

I had to do something similar for my "AJAXed WordPress" plugin. The
admin menu is pluggabble, so I needed an easy way to plug menus in,
and it was getting horrible having random inputs everywhere because
the more I added stuff, the more complicated the menus became with
different classes, formats, and hints/tip buttons.

I ended up writing all the menus in simple XML, having that processed
and then formatted into the correct HTML. It cut the size of the menus
drastically.

I've thought several times of extracting that code and releasing it
but I haven't gotten around to it yet.

Hi,

One would think that with all the recent standards-based discussion and all, WP wouldn't be using target="" attributes on links; but I was surprised to find that certain links in the admin center use _blank.

This is annoying on more than one level - seeing as all browsers support tabs, _blank will open the link in a new Window (except in Opera, which fortunately intercepts _blank calls and converts them to new tabs) which is pretty annoying behavior for us tab-lovers.

More importantly, to the best of my knowledge _blank has been phased out of the HTML standards...

Any idea why we're using them?

When _blank causes a new window to open, then that's your browser doing
that. _blank links open in a new tab for me in Firefox and I believe even
IE7. It all comes down to preferences.

Anyway: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6163

For the rest (post previews, etc.), make a ticket and write some code so the
new tab/window will be opened via JS rather than _blank.

I use many browsers to test page design, but Firefox and Opera are my
main personal use choices. I have set the preferences in each to open
tabs rather than windows (the default on Opera), so this is not an
annoyance at all.

Why has the target parameter has been dropped? I sometimes want to
force a visitor to a page to open a link in a new window/tab, rather than
replace the page containing the link. It is ridiculous for the authors of
the xhtml standards to remove this functionality.

Ah, but I digress... ;-)

WP rawks!

It was never an intended functionality in the first place really and it
still works under XHTML, it just breaks validation.

The <br> tag also works under XHTML, but it does not validate as XHTML, which 
means it is not XHTML, which means you should probably use the HTML 4 doctype 
instead.

No, it validates just fine, if you use it right, i.e. <br />

In XHTML, all non-closing tag elements (br, img, link, meta, etc.) need to
have a slash before the closing bracket.

<img src="http://site.com/image.jpg" alt="My Image" />

AFAIK, it was dropped because the original intention of the target="" 
attribute was for framesets, and frames have been dropped from XHTML. 
I've always thought it was an unfortunate side effect that you can't do 
target="_blank" anymore either, but maybe it was intentional by the W3C 
for some reason.

In any event, yeah I think most people who are hip to tabs have set up 
their browser prefs to open target="_blank" in a new tab instead of a 
window. Also, I am pretty sure that using the target attribute works 
fine when validating for XHTML transitional. Personally, I hate it when 
new windows are opened using javascript; I think it's overkill to use 
javascript for something that can be done in the markup.

As I wasn't among the authors of any version of html standards,
I don't know what the intended functionality was. It seems to
me that the standard should exist as a guide for browser and
page designers to ensure a smooth, consistent experience for
the user. Determining what functionality is "allowed" (artificially
limiting the technology), rather than how it is implemented, is
beyond the authority of the standards group.

By causing the target parameter to break validation, they have,
in effect, removed it. Naturally, I want my sites to validate. That
doesn't mean I want to lose functionality. So what does this mean?
It means I won't support xhtml, but will continue using html4.
I suppose I need to change the doctype in WP and remove any
offending tags (if any) that don't validate under html 4.01. What
a PITA this all is, eh? All I'm trying to do is create web sites. :)

@Jessica: I agree, unnecessary use of javascript should be discouraged.

Interesting article on html v5 and xhtml v2 for those interested
at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5xhtml2.html

Cheers.

I'm also interested in submitting a proposal for WP performance. Jacob  
has some excellent ideas above and covered most of mine as well :)  
Though Jacob is a lot more involved and experienced than I am, I'm  
going to give it a shot anyway.

My main idea was to set up an easy way to run a set of performance  
tests against the current codebase. These tests would be 'action'  
centric - viewing (various) pages, posting an entry, posting a  
comment, deleting a comment, etc etc. Some sort of framework could  
allow batched, high-volume (1000 times?) randomized testing of each  
action, logging times, queries, and whatever else. This gives a quick  
and easy way to know how a certain code change affects performance.  
Jacob's idea with the xdebug plugin/parser could also sit on top of  
this 'framework' and grab some statistics.

This framework can take a form similar to a lot of the code in  
wordpress-tests/wp-testlib. My primary concern here is to make  
performance tuning relatively trivial to do, and hence can be done  
regularly, perhaps as each release's development is drawing to a  
close. I'm not sure if wordpress's development process needs this; it  
was, if anything, just a neat idea.

It could also handle figuring out which sections of the codebase don't  
scale well; i.e., what happens when you comment on a post with 100  
other comments? 10000 other comments?

I believe xdebug can output files that can be visualized with  
KCachegrind; then I'd love to spend some time optimizing the most  
obvious bottlenecks. Not sure if that is worth including in the scope  
of a GSoC project?

I think the idea of having a 'build' system that combines files  
together is worth having; opening the hundred-odd files that wordpress  
includes must be quite expensive? This is obviously a question that  
can easily be answered by testing with the framework.

I don't have much more ideas; a lot of exploration will need to happen  
to find out which direction is the best to pursue if I'm accepted. I'd  
be happy to work with Jacob and do a joint project, if that is  
accepted and preferred by the mentors.

I'd love some feedback on my ideas here, what else to include, what  
I've missed, etc. This is the first time I've started working on an  
open-source project and I've been eyeing wordpress since its b2 days;  
I'm so excited to finally get involved. I'd just like to say - thank  
you for the opportunity.

Most browsers interpret both these ways of writing the tag the same way, but 
<br> does not validate, <br /> does. It's a big different.

Following the XHTML standard is pretty black and white, either it validates or 
it does not.

If it does not validate, it's not XHTML anymore, it's something inbetween 
HTML4 and XHTML and it's up to the browser to decide what to do with it.

Actually, it's just that browsers are relatively very forgiving and ignore
the fact that you are missing the slash in <br>. If you had a standards
strict browser or something that was trying to parse the XHTML and couldn't
account for coding mistakes, it would fail.

But we're getting off-topic. :)

Oh, and for the record, the admin area as it is right now does validate as
XHTML 1.0 Transitional, but just about anything decent will validate as
Transitional, so that's not saying too much.

While we're talking about it, I also dislike the usage of
target="_blank" in the admin. Not because it is deprecated, but because
of the reason *why* it is deprecated: Users should be able to decide
themselves whether they want a link to open in the same or another
tab/window. And with current UAs, this is no problem: You don't even
have to select "Open in new tab/window" from the menu, but it is usually
sufficient to click the link with the mouse wheel to open it in a new
tab.

Therefore, I don't need websites to tell me whether I want a link open
in the same or another tab. For example: I'm currently developing a
customers site on a trunk install (in expecting WP 2.5 to be released
soon). I often switch between website and admin frontend and back again.
Sometimes I want it in the same tab, sometimes in a second one. I
especially hate the situations where the admin area links have
target="_blank" attributes, because it leaves me with ten tabs open
after a time, while I'm used to manage my open tabs by clicking either
left button (same tab) or mouse wheel (another one).

If I want a link with target="_blank" to open in the same window, I
cannot do this in Firefox; it doesn't even indicate that it will open in
a new tab. Konqueror luckily indicates it, and it has an option for such
links in the context menu, "open in same tab" -- but this is also
tedious.

Therefore, target="_blank" is a real workflow breaker, at least for me.


Best regards,
Alex

For completeness' sake, such tags are referred to as "singletons" when
used in such a manner in XML or XHTML.  It is just as valid to write.
<img src="http://site.com/image.jpg" alt="My Image"></img>

Perhaps then I should be asking why the "Visit Site" link in the WordPress admin center opens in a new pag/tab/window/browser/whatever and not in the same one..

I can understand that functionality for stuff like "preview" and whatnot, but I'd *think* that "Visit Site" would be a normal link, unless one shift/ctrl+clicks it.

I hadn't replied on-list to the original post by Jason (busy week), but he had raise some really interesting posts.

But you need a baseline. Assuming the goal of the project is to improve the *current* codebase and /not/ just to make sure it doesn't get any worse; then you'll need to first fix the code *then* continuously build/test/monitor its performance, no?

With regards to your questions about *database*-scaling, the answer is quite simple: so long as you're using a modern RDBMS and you have decently-coded queries (i.e. no recursive nested queries, etc.) the only difference should be in the time it takes for the response to be sent to the PHP parser and for the PHP parser to circle through that many records in linear progression. I've seen it myself on my own blog, which has posts from 0 to 1000 comments.

More importantly: *WHY* are we opening/including all those millions of files when we only a minor fraction of them to do what we currently need? It'd be better to (RE: the codex) only include/merge files needed for each single operation and then call that (operation,file) tuple when requests are made.

Thanks for your post, it's nice to see fresh ideas and new people!

Well put, Alex. I just want to re-iterate that this is the beauty of using valid HTML <a> markup on a modern browser.
Shift+Click == New window.
Ctrl+Click == New tab, w/ focus (latter part depends on browser)
Middle-Click == New tab
etc....

There is no need for it to be hard-coded except in some rare circumstances (i.e. a form with a submit button that needs to open the result in a new tab/window, etc. - and even then, some browsers like Opera have shift+click support for that, too).

As Alex says, the hard-coding of the destination of a link is a real workflow-killer. Currently I just middle-click /all/ links (as Alex says, you don't know where it's going to open) then ctrl+w the current one :-(

Bah... I'm testing Safari now, and it's a "cute" browser (for lack of better word) but it's so stubbornly un-configurable... that's where I noted this behavior on.

Okay, this is for Mac users only.  If you don't like using the WP Rich- 
text editor, you need to know that TextMate is the coolest post editor  
evar.

Learn a few shortcuts (such as control-shift-< ), and check out the  
"Blogging" bundle.  Write your post and take advantage of excellent  
markup shortcuts, then post directly to your blog.

That is all.

If you're using Safari 3.1, it can be persuaded to open "target" links  
in tabs rather than windows:

It's one of Apple's hidden preference settings..

I'm on Windows, so I had to add that to the com.apple.Safari.plist file manually; thanks for the tip. I just realized that even middle-clicking a target="_blank" link in Safari will STILL open it in a new window, so thanks!

But I think I'm going to ditch Safari anyway, I still can't get it to open links from other programs in the same window (i.e. clicking 3 links in your message in my desktop email client opens three new Safari windows).

Darn, I was hoping to see if anyone had a good argument FOR leaving the 
target="_blank" on the Visit site link.

Circle 6 also whipped up a nice WordPress theme bundle --

It's been a while since it was updated, but it seems to be fairly relevant.

Since fs based caching has been removed from 2.5, has anyone come up

Could also be useful for local dev, so we don;t need apc, memcache,

I do run memcache locally anyway for other dev, so I'll be okay, but

It is on my todo list to take the old core code and make it a plugin.

It just hasn't happened yet :-( but it shouldn't be difficult.

Donncha's WP Super Cache works wonders.  I've been using it on my
Dreamhost-ed site and it's pretty astounding, performance-wise.

Isn't file based caching not that much faster than no caching?

Although personally I just use nothing on my personal blog and
WP-Super-Cache on my high traffic site.

Almost everything's faster than no caching with WordPress, especially  
with the "default" themes that do like 30 something queries in  
header.php alone...

This should do the trick:
http://neosmart.net/downloads/software/WordPress/Plugins/object-cache/file-object-cache_1.0.zip

Just extract it to /wp-content/object-cache.php and you should be good to go. Let me know if it gets the job done and I'll publish it in a more "official" manner. (since it resides in wp-content it's a plugin... it just doesn't show up in the admin center's plugin page though).

I'm willing to take up the maintenance of the file-based caching along with NST's existing WP plugins for XCache and eAccelerator; as you point out, it can be pretty important :)

Cheers!

The xcache plugin appears to still work.  I had a wierd issue on
install, I removed the plugin and after bouncing the server everything
seems to be working well, with and without the plugin.

But this isn't a file caching plugin, as xcache is a memcache, apc,
eaccelerator equivalent.

The idea (which I did not express very well) was to have that  
framework; then a set of 'definitive' benchmarks to run, which gives a  
bunch of numbers. Let's run that on, say, the final 2.5 release. Would  
that be a baseline to work from?

Once the framework is there it is easier to quantify just how much  
better (or worse) a change is, be it core patch or plugin. Then the  
actual work can start being done, in a similar way that wp-testlib has  
first to be written before wp-testcases could be written?

I wouldn't be surprised if someone has already written some sort of  
php performance testing 'suite' - that could readily be adapted, if  
possible.

Eek, bad example; but maybe I'm chasing an empty category. I wonder,  
the description on the gsoc2008 codex page (which I assume you  
wrote?), what does "don't scale well" mean? I took it to mean load  
scaling, i.e. what happens when there are thousands of this request  
rather than dozens.

Since you've run some well-hit wordpress blogs, you'd have a good idea  
where to start from?

That's an excellent idea. If there was some way to combine those files  
before deployment, in a way that keeps wordpress's architecture  
relatively ummodified for plugin compatibility, and also maintain APC/ 
etc opcode caching compatibility? It sounds like a tall order.

Are you still interested in releasing PerformancePress? Or, not  
necessarily 'releasing' it, but making its code available in some form  
so interested parties (e.x. me) could pursue and find out what you've  
done differently?

Thanks for your comments!

Matt asked me to follow up on this.  We've collected a couple of days  
worth of stats for OpenID on WordPress.com.

Day 1
--------
trusted				2410
trust_once			339
manual_add			134
add_always_trust	172
remove_trust			22
do_not_trust			60

Day 2
--------
trusted				1868
trust_once			312
manual_add			132
add_always_trust	145
remove_trust			28
do_not_trust			45


Some explanation on what these numbers are:

trusted - requests from sites that required no user interaction  
because they were already in the user's trusted list
trust_once - user clicked the "Yes; just this time" for a request
manual_add - user entered a trust manually in wp-admin
add_always_trust - user clicked the "Yes; always" for a request
remove_trust - user removed domain trust in wp-admin
do_not_trust - user clicked "No" for a request

Unfortunately I don't have a break down for how many unique users  
this translates to.  But even if we took the "trusted" number and  
figured that accounted for unique users (which would probably be on  
the high side), these numbers seem pretty small.  You can compare  
them to other stats at : http://wordpress.com/stats/

What's the consensus on db caching?

It would seem like that road is the lowest-common-denominator -  
perhaps the only way to performance-enhance for restrictive shared  
hosting envirs.

There are several levels to start with - caching whole pages, a la  
movable type - but dealing with frequent cache invalidation (who said  
this was the most difficult problem in computer science?). Lower level  
caching - of the post object, comment objects, etc - should be worth  
it too. It might not enable any old shared host to survive a full- 
scale digg+slashdot attack, but might let one hold up a smaller rush  
of traffic.

Is db caching worth it? Is there any demand for it? Does it exist  
already, in some ready form?

This seems to work wonder Mamhoud. Big thanks!!

On this note, do the caching object and plugins still make use of the  
ENABLE_CACHE constant in wp-config.php.
In other words, is checking if the latter is set to true (and as the  
codex page states, that DISABLE_CACHE isn't set either) to know if  
caching is available?
Or can I just check if the caching functions exist (version handling)  
and they'll just fail gracefully (return false) if cache isn't enabled?
What's the best practice?

Viper: The plugin I'm writing is interacting with an external xml/json  
api, so caching greatly enhance the performance regardless of if it's  
file or mem based, since it limits the remote connections.

Again, big thanks. I'm sure this will be useful to some.

I've disabled checks for ENABLE_CACHE constants for all the NST object-cache plugins - since you have to make a conscious decision to stick that object-cache.php file there, I assume you do want the caching benefits.

As for checking if caching is enabled - the current WP caching model lets you use the API to cache at all times. If file/xcache/eaccelerator/etc is enabled, that functionality will be used. Otherwise, caching will be performed for the individual request that you're currently serving, and cached data will expire at the end of the request.

I attempted to convert all the object-cache extensions into actual plugins, but that is not possible unfortunately since it would result in the re-declaration of a class.

Robert Marsh replied to the Object Caching article on my blog that he's created a database-cache extension and in his case it has helped performance. I'll cut and paste my reply:

***************
I assume you're simply storing key-value relationships in a (temporary?) MySQL table; thus turning into more-or-less a dictionary? Temporary tables would probably perform quite-decently given that they're stored and kept in the memory, verses normal tables which have portions cached in the memory but reside on-disk......

Now that I think about it though, it actually does make sense. After all, you're getting memory-based (even if only partially) storage for commonly-accessed values; retrieving them with some highly-optimized compiled-C code (the MySQL engine). [compared with accessing files off the disk each and every time with the usual WP file-based caching scenario.

I was thinking of submitting a gsoc proposal on something cache- 
related. Paint me ambitious, but I think there can be a cache solution  
that is acceptable for core inclusion. Obviously database-backed  
caching is the only kind that will be support on *all* deployments of  
WP.

It wouldn't be too difficult to write an db-object-cache.php that  
would serialize objects and put them into the database. Another way to  
do it is to store snippets of HTML, from comments, posts and the like.

Actually - caching can (should?) be integrated into the core, as  
suggested by the "Integrated Caching Solutions" gsoc idea. Right now,  
it consists of dumping files here and there. Instead, WP could ship  
with 1) an admin interface (under "Settings") to enable/disable  
caching, select caching type (db, memcached, etc) and configure these  
caches; 2) a default caching mechanism - most likely, a db-backed one.

Caching, I think, is a fairly crucial component of WP. A default  
caching method would raise the traffic a vanilla WP blog can take. I  
suppose there could also be a more official structure for all the  
plugins out there to plug into (pun not intended) - not just the the  
object cache as is now, but also an admin interface.

Is this worth pursuing?

Sorry for hijacking the thread; I hope Stephane/everyone doesn't mind!

Hello WP-Hackers!

Let me introduce my self, I am Cesar Rodas, a php && WP fan from Paraguay. I
am studying Computer Programming and I am in the third year.

I want to propose two projects in Google Summer of Code for Wordpress. I
have describe one project here
http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2008#Category_suggester, I don't know if I
can describe it here, If I cannot please apologizes me.

BTW, I have wrote a  post in my
blog<http://cesarodas.com/2008/03/contributing-with-wordpress.html>describing
both projects.

What the folk thing about my project?, What do you suggest to improved it?
And what steps do I need to do for a formal proposal (I have write a
document like this<http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC_2008_Application_Template>but
i don't know where send).

Just thought I'd inform the list that I'm working on a widget manager for
the new dashboard (the dashboard isn't rearrangeable out of the box). I
didn't want anyone else starting their own version thinking no one else was
working on one (I heard a couple people tossing the idea around).

The double text is kinda a WordPress bug, but I may end up working around it
if it doesn't get patched ( see http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6349 ).

I'll post an alpha/beta once I hack together preference saving (the save

I agree that caching should be integrated into the core, and storing it in a 
db-backend is fine by me.

Whenever I see heavy load on a PHP application it's allways the database that 
is taking the highest load, with bad written SQL statements with X amount of 
joins and sorting and function calls like "rand()".

Simple select on an indexed field (key) is very fast and would be a good 
solution for storing cache. Just keep in mind not to use function calls (as 
mentioned above), because MySQL does not cache any statements having function 
calls.


It's also easy to implement TTL too where the TTL is a date in the near future 
(like two hours) and issue the SQL statement like this.

DELETE FROM wp_cache WHERE ttl < NOW()

But, of course, not use NOW() but make PHP insert the date into the SQL 
statement in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS" format (or something) that MySQL supports, to 
releave MySQL server for unnessecary function calls... as MySQL doesn't have 
enough to do already...? ;)

The ttl column in wp_cache needs to be indexed too.

This is one of those... If it don't make into core, it ends up a plugin 
deals... If Cache was a huge issue, it would have been solved by now, 
and my guess, is... its not, so whatever is, is OUT THERE NOW...

Cache is in core, but it sucks yes.. I agree. If you're proposing a GOOD 
ASS cache for core, do it right. The default Cache sucks ass... sorry,

it just messed my whole blog up... so. ... whoever is proposing this

And, Mr. Awesome, what do you think of the idea of reimplementing the  
file-based caching as a database-backed cache? Would that be core- 
worthy?

Also, what do you mean, specifically, by "messed my whole blog up"?  
Would be good to have that in mind while coding.

Hey everyone,

A plugin has to be GPL compatible to get into the WordPress.org plugin  
repository right? So, if a plugin is in there, and there's no license  
attached to it, can you safely assume it's GPL?

I want to know because one plugin I really like, and with me many  
others, the cformsII plugin:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cforms/

has this annoying feature of linking back to the plugin page from each  
contact form instance, which I want to remove, but I can't find a  
license for it.

I was wondering if anyone, preferably from Automattic ;), could have  
their say on this.

Cheers,
Joost

Ronald, I fully understood what you were talking about before, I
simply disagreed with it. You might want to reread my response to you,
as I did not misunderstand your idea in the first place.

You can't really enable OpenID for login/registration only. Commenting

With regards to the database-based caching... it's hardly worth a project.
It would take all of an hour to make and test a db-based caching solution (like that used in vBulletin), and simply adding it to wp-includes/cache.php (for the core) or as an extension to the core-caching feature by sticking it in wp-content/object-cache.php.....

It's already controlled by the presence of DEFINEs in wp-config.php; but it can easily be switched to an admin-center option.

/me mulls it over.

Anyway, all this talk has got me convinced that a line of code is worth a thousand painted pictures; so I'll see what I can draft up real quick.

It either has to be GPL or a less restrictive license, like FreeBSD or
MIT-style.

I think first and foremost the target audience are the people on  
shared hosts. I'm guessing that db caching could squeeze more  
performance outta vanilla wp than it has now.

I was thinking to cache not just full-html pages, but also serialized  
objects. For some blogs (say, one with some php ad rotating system),  
it would make sense to disable full page caching entirely. Caching  
these objects will require extending the current WP_Cache to allow  
invalidation of groups of objects (i.e., all posts, all comments,  
etc). This is quite a large, large project, actually. Maybe it isn't  
even possible to implement something like this without major breakage;  
perhaps pages have to be specifically marked as 'fullpage cachable'  
and 'object cachable'; unmarked pages would go straight to db.

One potential problem is that many shared hosts have db size limits.  
So the implementation will need to keep track of the entire db size  
and remove less used objects as the cache size gets too big.

It might make sense to build this 'size limiter' into the core, since  
I imagine most caching solutions will want to limit the size of the  
cache - either in memory or on disk. (I'm not sure if memcached deals  
with overflowing caches already?)

Then, to do this we'll need to keep track of cache hits - probably  
should collect all of the hits and commit them to db at shutdown.

I suppose we should keep the per-invocation object cache as is, so we  
don't hit the database more than once for each object.

I also thought that full-page HTML caches would need some special  
handling. If gzip is enabled, we'll want to cache two versions (if  
that is possible and isn't too demanding). Can also tread into WP  
Super cache territory - write to .htaccess and redirect cached pages  
to some separate "wp-fromcache.php" file that will include the bare  
minimum of wp files - just enough to do the one db query for the  
cached page.

If we were to go ahead to build what is really a caching solution into  
wp core, then we have to be very careful where we put all these little  
fiddly features, to minimize wheel reinvention by future cache plugin  
writers.

And, I'm sure there are plenty of places in the WP codebase where more  
caching hooks can be used, etc.

So lots to do, caching-wise. Some of the things above may be braindead  
suggestions, I'm a little sleepy still.

> It's already controlled by the presence of DEFINEs in wp-config.php;

The admin interface is much lower priority, of course. There's always  
time to write pretty panels.

That's what the current object cache does, though.. It *was* a big project, and WP 2.5 references the cache even more than previous versions do.

Definitely we should look to hook into the object-cache in as many places as possible in the code; but for the most part, that's already being done. AND the hooks are in place to invalidate it.

For instance, I hacked "Brian's Latest Comments" module (~30+ queries per page to get all comments, associate comments with posts, etc.) to use object-cache *and* use WP hooks to invalidate the cache when a new comment is made, deleted, approved, or unapproved. WP already does that with some of the widgets, and throughout the core.

Maybe I'm missing something here, but most of what you're suggesting is already there :S

**My Reasons**

I just want to make sure that the dbdelta() function won't give me any issues w/ this code. It won't be of any use without the ENGINE=MEMORY bit, so I might have to force it with $wpdb->query directly.

I am intrigued by the category project. I wonder whether you could
expand on the advantages and disadvantages of this project and also
maybe why you don't think it would work with tags. I think personally
I am only just beginning to understand the use of categories and tags
and I would appreciate to see how you might decide on a category as
opposed to tagging!

With regards, I apologize for the late response. To reply, Google does 
not allow groups. If we are both accepted, we'll just work on our 
separate solutions and hopefully at the completion, bits and pieces of 
the highest quality will be used from either project. Good luck and if 
you are accepted, I look forward to seeing what solution you provide and 
how you handled it.

The baseline doesn't matter. I say this, because the goal is to find 
where the current application is taking the most time and try to 
optimize those areas. It might be you optimize one area, only to find 
that a completely different area pops up to be time consuming. I would 
suggest you run, fix, rinse, and repeat and continue until you can no 
longer optimize the core any longer.

You can benchmark the database queries using PHP. There is a library for 
mysql (which so happens is what WordPress uses) and mysqli, and 
eventually PDO, called mysqlnd. If you compile mysql using that library 
instead of the libmysqld library, then you'll gain the additional 
benchmarking functions. Eh. If you find a tutorial on how to do this, 
then it could probably be added to the benchmark plugin. The goal should 
also be to track down poorly optimized SQL queries and fix those as well.

http://www.santosj.name/general/wordpress-google-summer-of-code-project/

My solution for the file includes is only to see if putting all of the 
functions in a few files will help with the speed of the bootstrap. 
Perhaps one day, a better MVC implementation will be used that will 
allow for including only what is needed during any page load. However, 
for now, whatever method would require a build process, so it would only 
be to prove or disprove that using one file is an advantage to WordPress 
Execution speed. I still think that doing so would be a disadvantage for 
contributors with having one massive file with many many lines of code.

Sorry, I thought PerformancePress name was original, but it appears I 
borrowed the idea from you, Mahmoud Al-Qudsi. Or at the very least, we 
thought of the same generic term. I like the idea and it would be cool 
to see how you were able to implement it.

OK, scratch the MySQL idea. The overhead of 190-315 queries BY FAR* exceeds the benefits gained in lookup times.
.... and that's on a clean install of WP running nothing but Kubrick.

The problem is that every "caching hook" results in an additional MySQL lookup (though second hits for the same request do NOT reach the db).

I don't think there's any room for extra performance here. I'm using Indexes, Memory-based tables, high-speed lookups (the pack option); but MySQL wasn't created to be a dictionary ;-)

I can provide the code if anyone cares to look at it; but it seems like a dead-end here.

* query overhead resulted in 4-5 times longer page-loads.


Sorry guys!

That's insane - definitely kills the idea stone dead. Unless.. could  
one prefetch a bunch of 'standard' objects at the very start, and work  
from there? That might reduce the query count down significantly.  
Another idea: fetch an entire group when one item from that group is  
requested; maybe you're doing  this already.

I hope using the database for caching full html pages will be a little  
more realistic.

The algorithm can work suggesting categories or tags (I just put category as
a generic name because it suggest anything related to categorization,
i.etags, categories, languages, if it is spam or not and so forth). I
have an
example which is an spam
detector<http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/4236.html>which
works with N-grams with great results on my tests.  Personally i don't
the different nor advantage to use tags instead of categories.

I think the main advantage is that the WP will be the "intelligence" to
suggest you tags or categories (or anything else that can be useful) based
on previous posts.

Does it require any new tables? How does it scale with large numbers of 
posts/tags?

I guess that's possible; it certainly would reduce the overhead... But at the moment the caching system simply retrieves items by key (basically the DB becomes a <key,value> dictionary) and there is no sense of "relationships" between the various keys. Perhaps that could be added though, one would need to look into that.

Well, if you're caching a full page there shouldn't be any problem with storing the HTML on-disk (assuming the problem with file-based object-caching is the sheer number of requests - similar to above). Any particular reason why you'd store the HTML in the DB instead?

This is how I think about it:

* Categories are 'buckets' for your post. Think of these like sections  
of a site, in a sense.
** examples: articles, editorials, asides

* Tags are the 'topics' you cover. These topics cross over categories  
and more specific.
** examples: google, web design, wordpress

Also, surfing tags, such as those on technorati and similar services  
can give you ideas about the kind of tags you want to use if you care  
about using a shared vocabulary with other bloggers.

YYMV, but this system works for me, and keeps the number of categories  
and tags down to a meaningful level. If you get overly specific with  
your cats/tags the system becomes unusable for you and confusing for  
your users.

I was thinking to build the database caching on top of the current per- 
invocation object cache; basically, fork wp-includes/cache.php as is  
now, then cache the groups at shutdown, and prefetch some (all?) of  
the groups at wp_cache_init. Basically prefill WP_Object_Cache::cache.

I'm working on the assumption that the size of people running  
wordpress on shared hosts with no filesystem writing support is non- 
negligible. I have no idea if this is correct; do you have an idea?

It can save the features (or the knowledge) on a flat-file or database, of
course is better on a database. And the number of post do not care in the
performance since it is computed one time, what affect the performance is
the number of tags or categories. It will work fine up to 50 tags or
categories, with graters number it will take some time to compute, which is
not a bad point because usually you take some time to write articles and
this categorizer can run in the "background" (via Ajax or similar call).

What the folk thing of my ideas?

I'm not reinventing the wheel. Infact, the whole plugin that made my
previous screenshot is only ~150 lines so far.

The dashboard is actually just a regular sidebar with regular widgets, but
they are only registered when you are actually viewing the dashboard
(because you don't want them to show up on the regular sidebar and widget
editor). I'm merely extending that so they are also registered on my manage
page and then I use some hackery to use the existing manage widget functions
to show the dashboard "sidebar" and widgets.

As for your link, it's fairly obsolete now as 2.5 introduces a new widget
manager (which is what my page is using):

Thanks though! :)

I was planning on re-releasing it though ;) nah, just kiddin'

On another note: these link backs are incredibly annoying, every other  
new plugin author seems to feel that just because he hacked a few  
lines of code together, he deserves a link back to his site... Would  
be good if the wordpress.org rules prevented you from doing that.

Theres a mysql memory object cache allready available, you may want to take a look at that:

http://www.deliciousdays.com/cforms-plugin

that plugin for instance, adds a link back to that download page on  
every instance of the contact form. That plugin is also to be found  
here:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cforms/

I've seen other plugins, like this one: http://amazingwordpressthemes.com/wordpress-spam-blocker/ 
  do it, but at least that's not in the repository....

Remove it if you don't like it? It's nowhere near as offensive as a
spammy link (as notoriously happened with themes and plugins), and I
think most people would agree that credit and a link is hardly the
most brazen thing for authors to include in the plugins that they
release open source and for free.

While there are some "spammy" plugins, C-forms is not one of them. If
a plugin author is giving away a plugin for free, the least a user can
do is give them a link back. If you don't like the link, edit it out
or use a different plugin.

I was reading to come storming out against you and then realized I don't 
disagree.
But I think some something here has come un-glued at a semantic level.

So forgive me for being crude:
Why are there 2?

If I post something with Category "WordPress" and Tag "BlueSky" the 
difference in "level" is entirely my reading of things.

AFIAK searching for "BlueSky" in Tags will bring up that post. As will 
Cat "WordPress." And searching for both would very likely bring up that 
post and only that post.

So: how is that different from posting with both those terms used as 
Category?

The interface suggests very strongly that there's a major diff between 
the two.
Maybe there isn't, actually?

What would be lost (getting over the momentary confusion) if Categories 
disappeared and we were left with the same funtionality bundled together 
as "Tags"?
Are we using 2 terms for the same stuff?

BTW: when I ask a question I really and truly am fishing for an answer 
cuz I suspect there's something I've overlooked.

The distinction between tags and categories is left up to the user.
Here is how I see them.

Categories are broad sections that describe a general content area:
WordPress, Physics, Linguistics.

Tags are topics that a specific article is about: AJAX Plugins,
Condensed Matter, Ethnology

In print terms, Tags are the glossary for a post and Categories are
the sections of the bookstore you would find the post in. However,
different people use them differently.

I put up a list on the download pages for the NST plugins, I'll copy it below:

* XCache for WordPress
http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=12

* eAccelerator for WordPress
http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=13

* File-Based Caching for WordPress
http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=14 (already published to the list, will be up soon)

* APC for WordPress
http://txfx.net/files/wordpress/apc-object-cache.phps

* Memcached for WordPress
http://ryan.wordpress.com/2005/12/23/memcached-backend/


Am I missing any?


My code's a bit different from yours... I'm saving a lot of queries by using a normal INSERT query with an ON DUPLICATE trigger instead of issuing a DELETE then an INSERT for each and every call. I'm not splitting up serialized data though, just base64_encode() and storing it as a varbinary (which is limited by bytes not chars) in the database. Haven't gotten around to implementing the expirations, not sure if there's a point though seeing just how much slower database-caching is in 2.5 thanks to the increase in the number of hooks.

Here's my code, for what it's worth:

Not sure.

Haven't gotten around to implementing the expirations, not sure if there's a point though seeing just how much slower database-caching is in 2.5 thanks to the increase in the number of hooks.

To be fair, Its not my code, I just had it on the local drive, no idea where i got it from, i think it was posted to wp-hackers last year.

Expirations ARE needed, else the blog would continuously show the same data at that point in time, no changes afterwards.. WP only ever used 5minute expirations though, And some parts of the code (posting and commenting) delete the cached data too, but many things dont delete, just use if its cached.

ON DUPLICATE is a good way actually, I think it might be slower though, i'm not sure.

I'm not sure why your base64 encoding it though, surely that'd be slow? As long as its utf8, it should be able to store any characters you need, base64 encoding only adds extra overheads.
Also, Some caches can be VERY large, some only small, I think i remember some people having upwards of 50MB's in file caches just for the object cache.

Yeah I know. I was just questioning whether it is worth investing extra time in doing so if there is no point to a MySQL cache in the first place.

It's either INSERT INTO .... ON DUPLICATE, REPLACE INTO, or DELETE FROM ... INSERT INTO. From what I gleamed from the MySQL docs, ON DUPLICATE is the most efficient way.

I have no idea either :S

I had originally $wpdb->escape()'d the data, then stripslashes()'d it in the get() function; but for some messed-up reason the deserializer kept breaking on the slashed-and-unslashed code. If you know why, I'd love to find out.

Individual files too? With a varbinary(4096), it has support for up to 4KiB in a single cache object. The problem (as I'm sure you know) is that MEMORY tables are fixed-row-size; so I can't use BLOB, LONGTEXT, etc.

Not individual files, that was as a whole folder of files.

But 4KiB isnt much data really, its definately not enough to store multiple reasonable sized blog entries.

Which is why it was splitting it into 4 chunks, and then over multiple rows if need be.

Also, doing a delete for any row thats expired should be really quick with a memory table, If need be, you could even only run it on (rand(0,5) == 5), but i'd just take the slight performance hit myself and delete old rows, if you use a datetime, or a int field, it should be rather fast.

As a final note on this.. Is it worth running a mysql memory cache like this if you've got access ot mysql itself.
There are a few settings which allows mysql to cache queries much more efficiently, so that repeditive queries from WP are stored in memory..

Yeah, I agree... especially if the datetime field is indexed. I'd rather delete old rows when they're next accessed, something like

DELETE * FROM cache WHERE date<$date;
SELECT `value` FROM cache WHERE `key`=$key;

An important thing is to execute all simultaneous queries in the same call to $wpdb->query(); since *ANYTHING* that can reduce the MySQL overhead here is a good thing. (this isn't done in the old code, which executes the DELETE first, then goes back and executes the INSERT) 

Another possibility is to let PHP do the checking:
SELECT `value`, `age` FROM cache WHERE `key`=$key

Then have PHP check if `age` is less than $now-3600 or whatever. If it is, it'll return false and this entry will be overridden by the new data, no extra query needed.

This doesn't require access to the MySQL configuration files, and *should* run anywhere that WP can/does.

But the bottom line is that caching to MySQL is horribly inefficient.

I have reread your response, and I still think you're misunderstanding me,
but I see where you're confused now.
Yes, I cannot segregate the user system with OpenID from comments, and I am
not thinking of doing so. What I'm referring to is the way current OpenID
plugins work.

Current OpenID plugins usually take advantage of the URI field
in anonymous comment forms to enable OpenID commenting. A user with an
OpenID account would only fill out that one field, type their comment, and
click submit. Then, the plugin would complete the login process by either
registering a new user, or logging in that OpenID user.

What I'm talking about is completely forgetting that concept. I not only
feel that would encourage OpenID comments over anonymous ones, but I think
it's terrible user interface design. In my implementation a user could not
simply enter their OpenID in an anonymous comment form. They would have to
create a WordPress account to do so.

I feel this would discourage OpenID logins on existing anonymous comment
forms, yet still allow for added convenience should a site require
registration. I think is the best of both worlds. There is no encouragement
of OpenID for comments, and OpenID is used in its proper form,
authenticating user logins.

In fact, if user registration is disabled like it is for 99% of WordPress
websites, OpenID would have no effect on the commenter. The only person who
could use OpenID would be the blog administrator who has an existing
account.

Should user registration be enabled, the only scenario where a user could
use OpenID to comment, then what's the difference from commenting from a
user account logged in the traditional way, then commenting from an account
logged in with OpenID. I see absolutely no difference.

Does that make sense now?

Why both a Category and a Tag instead of 2 tags?

My method:
Categories define site content. You can design entire sections of a site by them.
Tags specify what content is contained in the category.

For instance, on my blog I would 
Categories: "Business, Software, Hardware, Programming"
Tags: "Intel, Microsoft, Linux, Windows, iPod, C#, PHP, WordPress, Automattic"

If Automattic buys Movable Type, I'd categorize it as business and tag it as Automattic and WordPress.

It's a fine line, and like has been said here and off-list many times; entirely up to the user.

> Why both a Category and a Tag instead of 2 tags?

Why not 2 categories instead?
What was it about Tags that WordPress's categories just didn't offer? After all, there WAS a lot of user-experience missing without the tags, so what is it that they added that made it so much better?

Answer that, and you'll have your answer.

I thought cforms had the option to disable "link love" but I've just 
checked and I can't see it. Maybe it was another plugin.

Personally, I think linking back to the author's site is ok *if* there's 
an option to disable it. On some sites it won't be appropriate, and so 
it should be easy to disable.

Why not code up as an option and send it to the plugin author, see if 
they'll include it?

Just for the record, it would be good to define "better" - it's a very 
subjective term.

This is quite brief:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists#List_Etiquette

I think it could easily become it's own page, or at least have "Avoid

for anyone to start editing this section.

I have not reported it in trac. If it is a bug, it's a design bug, not a 
code bug.

As I see it, there are a couple of options.

1) Only edit a term if that term is used in one and only one taxonomy, 
otherwise create a new term.
2) Add a "name" column to the taxonomy table so that the same term can 
have different names. This significantly changes the term functionality 
though.

I'll give it some further thought and then post something on trac.

Cheers - Callum.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp-gears! will it help?
Message-ID: <9dd1dfed0803240715k3818bbdcy7f186e7074b7dcca@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys, I am a student from Ethiopia thinking of applying for the google
summer of code program this year. i was thinking if wordpress gear could be
a good idea.

Wordpress uses alot of ajax scripts on the back end. the idea i am proposing
is to accelerate the backend of wordpress by using google gear, I am
proposing that with google gears, we can maintain a copy of the database at
the client side using the empowering sqlite database, which is supported by
google gears. this means that the application can catch the contents of the
database for offline use, not only this but it could also support offline
publishing in which case the client side database will be used to store the
changes, and at a later time when there is connection the changes will be
sent to the server.

what do you think about it as an idea?
for more information about google gears, please visit
http://gears.google.com

Elias,

Hey Viper.  Thanks for sharing.  I gave it a smoke test on RC1, and

No, I got what you said all the way around, and your idea. I really
did understand you the first time.

The problem with it is that if you add OpenID without adding it to
commenting as well, then it's practically useless for some large
number of the userbase. Furthermore, if you allow OpenID logins, but
then don't check those OpenID's on comments, then you could be said to
be intentionally making comments spoofable. Logged in users don't get
asked for their name/url info normally, but non-logged in users would
be able to use the exact same information.

I'm not opposed to OpenID commenting. I'm opposed to mandatory
registration for commenting. I'm opposed to *requiring* OpenID for
commenting, even. I think that OpenID in all currently implemented
forms (all the plugins) buggers that up completely.

Here's an alternative that maybe you have not considered:

1. Allow OpenID for logging in/registration. This is simply an
alternative to providing a password to login, basically. No problems
here. Note that they still must provide a username and password when
they register! You have to have such because of the next bit.

2. While you're at it, add OpenID server code. Let each user get their
own local OpenID by virtue of being a user. The profile pages can be
their url, or the author pages, or something along those lines.

3. The important bit: Allow OpenID for commenting, but allow it
without also requiring registration. That is, if somebody uses an
OpenID to comment, then allow it, but don't create a user account for
them and don't save any credentials or trust information or anything
like that. Basically, you'll have two separate options: a) Allow
OpenID comments, b) Only allow registered users to comment (this
option already exists).

Furthermore, make OpenID a *SEPARATE FIELD*. If I don't want to use my
OpenID, but do want to use my blog URL, then I should be able to do
so. Integrating the URL field with OpenID is annoying when I put in my
URL and then it detects my OpenID and I get a "do you want to trust
this site" message from my OpenID server. No, I don't want to trust
the site, and I didn't want to use OpenID either! Annoying, that is.

The best interface would likely be some kind of a javascript to let me
select either the normal 3 field thing or select the OpenID 1 field
and 2 extra steps thing. Maybe a "Use OpenID" link with the little
OpenID icon. Whatever, should be able to be themed differently of
course.

Different interfaces. Really, that's it.

-Categories are hierarchical in nature and tend to not be changed/created often.
-Tags are flat (no hierarchy), can be created on the fly by simply
typing them, and tend towards being larger numbers of them on each
post.

Conceptually, they are not really any different. Internally, they are
both terms inside of different taxonomies. Some people prefer one,
some prefer the other. Some (probably most) use both for different
sorts of things.

But really, they're just describing posts with some set of words. The
reason for two things is wholly the different interfaces. The two
types of interfaces are not particularly compatible, so they're both
offered. Anybody can use either/both in the way they see fit.

The analogy I use is that Categories are like a book's table of contents,
and Tags like its index.

Like all analogies it's not perfect, but it works well to explain to normal
users how Categories and Tags can be compatible and complementary.

Or, Categories are the big signs over the aisles at the supermarket,  
and tags are the contents labels on the products.

Thus:

Categories = broad sweep
Tags = details

I'm a little confused by your explanation of how my implementation of OpenID
could allow for spoof-able comments, but don't worry about re-explaining as
I'm forgoing that implementation.
I completely agree with you about requiring registration for OpenID
comments. I have been testing existing OpenID plugins this morning, and
every single one of them links OpenID comments to registration. There is no
reason why an OpenID comment needs an account. This is certainly one area
where a new plugin could improve in.

Regarding adding the server code for each user, again, I completely agree.
Users should have the option of allowing WordPress to be their OpenID
server, or point their account to an existing OpenID delegate.

Regarding a separate field, yet again, I'm right there with you. Using the
existing URI field is a bad interface. A separate field that switches place
with the anonymous fields using a Javascript toggle would be the best method
for using OpenID.

So, I'm now thinking a better plugin may be the best way to go about OpenID
support. As you mentioned earlier Otto, the current set of OpenID plugins,
while robust, are not widely adopted. Perhaps a different
plugin implementation may spark more OpenID adoption among WordPress users.
If that occurs, core inclusion could be looked at later down the road.

If I should go about developing another OpenID plugin, here is how it would
differ from existing plugins:

1. Allow for anonymous OpenID commenting without registration
2. Provide a separate field for anonymous OpenID comments, and don't utilize
the URI field like existing plugins do
3. Include an OpenID server for all registered WordPress users.
4. Provide an option for a user to delegate a third party OpenID provider
instead of using the built in server

Looking through current OpenID plugins, no plugin to date allows anonymous
OpenID commenting and there is no implementation of an OpenID server outside
of WordPress MU. There two areas would strongly benefit from an alternative
plugin.

In addition, working on a plugin instead of core support would
most definitely allow me to provide support for using WordPress as an OpenID
server. A plugin would give me the whole summer to add support and work out
the bugs, while core support would limit me to mid-summer for core
consideration.

What's everyone's opinion on developing an alternative plugin instead of
core support? Are there any features you feel are missing / should be
developed differently in current plugin implementations of OpenID?

Some plugins have it (like podpress and wp-super-cache); some are  
disabled by default (the second one), some are enabled (podpress), but  
you can disable it.

Also, if you are really sure you haven't anything that requires  
wp_footer() in your theme you can wipe out that tag and stop the  
issue. Or hack the plugin and remove the footer call or whatever else.

As a plugin author, I choose to have my backlink in every *admin* page  
that my plugin creates. I make them because I always hope that someone  
will put 2 cents on my paypal (and this still doesn't happen) *and*  
because I feel that I have the right to tell people using my plugins  
that I have worked on it several hours, but I won't link in the theme  
footer because it's not my website, and if every plugins do a  
wp_footer add with its credits I'll have a 30-lines footer, which is  
unacceptable.

Shortly: wipe out that link, send some money to the author and explain  
that you don't like the wp_footer call. Maybe they'll listen you. But  
send some money before telling it, this way maybe it will work ! :-)

But I wonder if it is just that tiny little bit more efficient than

Message-ID: <47E81475.4010103@foolishvisions.com>

My boss is looking to create a site that I'm not sure can be done 
without a LOT of custom code being written.  I don't even know what to 
search for in this case to see if it's possible with already-existing 
plugins or some simple functions or something.  Basically, if it can't 
be done simply (with existing plugins and/or some small edits) then he 
doesn't want to do it - he doesn't want to get too involved with 
custom-plugins and testing and all that.  So I told him I'd ask you all 
- if anyone would know, I believe you would!

So, what we're looking to do:

WordPress site.  Owner of the site will maintain a database of 
newspapers and funeral directors within the state (we'll keep it local 
for now, but I can see this expanding to the entire country).  This 
database will contain contact information (phone numbers, email and 
snail mail addresses, hours of operation, fees, policies, etc.)

It will be a fee-based membership area.  When someone logs in, they can 
search by town or zip code, and it'll bring up all the funeral directors 
*or* newspaper publications within an X-radius.  End user should be able 
to click on one (or more) checkboxes to select the publication (or 
funeral director) and send a mass email containing an obituary.  File 
upload are a must - the end user should be able to upload an image to 
run in the paper.

I know, kind of a morbid subject, but that's what they're looking to do. 
  Initially, I was confused, because I thought it would be one person 
managing the database, but as it turns out, they *alsO8 need an area 
where each FD and newspaper editor can log in and change their info as 
needed.  So I figured you could use the usermeta/userextra stuff to add 
to the profile and let them edit that way.  But I didn't know if there 
were any already-available plugins, or some code you all could point me 
to that could make the rest pretty easy to establish.

Has anyone done anything like this?  He already has a database of zip 
codes that is supposed to be easily integrated into the search form (I 
haven't seen it yet, so I'm taking his word), but I don't know how I 
would make this member-based, and how to allow for the multiple-sending, 
and all that stuff.  (Sorry, I'm running on 3 hours of sleep and one cup 
of coffee, so I'm kind of rambling)

I'd appreciate any input/point in the right direction/smack in the back 
of the head you all could provide.  I know I could do this on my own if 
I had time, but I don't - which is why he's looking for something quick.

Thanks!

This seems like a pretty specific feature list. Why bother hacking
this into Wordpress at all? What is it that your boss wants from

G'day Shelly,

I've built something quite similar to this. Check out this site:
http://www.uspokersearch.com/poker-room-directory/

I used a few simple plugins to hang it together, it's not super complex. 
Users have to be "contributors" on the blog to be able to create new 
poker rooms. Once they do that, the data is added to the system, the 
relevant pages are created, etc. It's all pretty straightforward.

It's probably 60% of what you want to do. It doesn't support the mass 
mailing feature. Obviously you'll need to watch out for spam on that. 
But it can't be that hard to implement.

Happy to discuss off-list if you want to see some code, etc. I'm guess 
you'll have to write some custom code though. I can't see any way round 
that.

Cheers - Callum.

 >>Why bother hacking this into Wordpress at all? What is it that your 
boss wants from Wordpress?<<

He's already using WordPress as the main part of the site - it's 
currently being used as a CMS.  He's the one who will be managing all of 
the input and providing the membership from the site itself.  He'd like 
to just have it integrated into the current wordpress system he's got 
running now, so he can manage everything from one spot.

When he first told me about it, I thought he would be the only one 
accessing this information 9therefore I thought it could be done by 
fudging with a few plugins I already new about that would insert the 
data into the database), but as the discussion went on, I realized that 
he wanted to basically manage it all, but allow a sort of "social 
networking" type of thing to go on between newspaper editors and funeral 
directors (and BuddyPress isn't out yet!) I didn't know if it could be 
done.

So I figured I'd ask the guys who know best - which would be you all, 
just to get your input.  I know WordPress can do a LOT (and I know that, 
if I were given time, I could even get it to do this myself) but I 
didn't know if something this complicated could be done with 
already-exisitng stuff.

Ah well that makes all the difference doesn't it? :) Callum's option
seems very close to what you want to do and with some work might be
able to accomplish your goal.

Brian Layman and I are going to be mentoring this project for GSoC.   
Andy Skelton mentioned that he might have some code or ideas to  
contribute as well.  I think it's definitely time for there to be some  
level of built-in output caching.  Everyone has their day on Digg et  
al, and I'm personally tired of seeing those WP sites go down until  
such time as the author can install a output caching plugin.  We can  
do better.  The downsides of caching (i.e. dealing with hyper-dynamic  
content and managing expirations) will be greatly blunted when the  
output caching framework is in WP core.

No. It's not that it's a neglible improvement, it's that it causes a DRASTIC SLOWDOWN as a result of the MySQL overhead compared to not using object caching at all. And file-caching is therefore even faster.

Robert Marsh sent me his code (very similar to the one I posted to the list earlier), and he notes:

>If it's any use to you I've attached a version of the persistent 
>MySQL object cache. Under 2.3 it actually produced a general

Same experience that I had. Basically, with a MySQL cache, the MORE you cache the LESS benefit you get.
If WP was only caching the stuff that it knows to be very heavy and then recalling that from the cache, then, yeah, it would be a performance improvement. But that's a non-ideal way of dealing with the object-cache; and it's thankfully not how WP does it.

Fact is, the overhead of a MySQL-based caching-lookup exceeds the time it would take to re-create that object from scratch. IMHO, it's a dead end and not worth pursuing further. 

I'd suggest spending one's time further optimizing the base WP code, or even re-writing the file-based cache to store all data in a single file, keep the filestream open throughout the request, and non-sequentially access the cached objects in it (if you really want a hard project that would reap some benefits that is).

We are seeing similar issues in the wp-testers list where I have been
offering to help debug upload issues. If you are not comfortable
hacking core and debugging the issue, you can email me directly.

I thought so too, I've got some rather large images on one of my plugin pages too, I was going to resize it to something more appropriate, but havnt got around to it.

It'd be nice if it did resize the image though..

Is there any good reason why the "get_the_excerpt" filter (wp_trim_excerpt)
calls the_content filter?
This means you cannot filter anything before the content is actually built.

Hi list,

I am in need for some help with an AJAX issue in my Exec-PHP plugin
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exec-php/). 

If the user is in WordPress' admin area, the plugin is retrieving some data
in the background. I implemented the AJAX calls as it is described in
http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins (section  Ajax on the
Administration Side). This usually works fine for most of my clients
including me. 

On some blogs the plugin occasionally (not on every call) runs into a 404
error saying that <blog address>/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php isn't available.
The only thing I could think of causing this error may be some kind of time
out?!? But I haven't found a way to verify this nor a SACK API call to set
a timeout for the AJAX call.

Did some of you have an idea what's causing this? I am pretty much
clueless.

Thanks in advance
S?ren

How are you determining <blog address> ?
The only cause i can think of, Is you're using the home url, instead of the site url or something.
Eg. The home url for my site is http://dd32.id.au/, But the url to the wordpress files is http://dd32.id.au/wordpress/

Make sure that the URL bar and the AJAX domain are the same. Both need
to have either the www. or not have it. I've run into this problem
several times.

have the form:

www.asite.com/?ref=spamsite.org&paged=10

I'm not sure where the ref parameter is used on an old english forum
thread there was a suggestion for a couple of line for .htaccess to
clena this URL eliminating any ref but iI think it's not a good idea
if ref has an use.

I'm not sure what advantage spammer have having weblinks around like
the one in the example, but it's annoying

I think the client-side-database is potentially way too early for
implementation. HTML5 is still in super-early-draft phase (the spec
actually changed yesterday for crying out loud), and it's uncertain
whether or not it will even get any real traction given that XHTML2 is
far more mature at this point. The fact that WebKit implemented it
doesn't change that the specification is still in major flux.

Gears, on the other hand, is out there now and working. And if the
code is abstracted enough, it could be switched to some other storage
system later, when it's more finalized.

wp_trim_excerpt creates an excerpt from the content, but only if
there's not a manually defined excerpt. It has to get the content and
apply the content filters so that it has the content to build the
excerpt from.

Firefox 3 also apparently supports offline storage.

http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/firefox_3_offline_apps.php

As a side note, I find the current nightly builds of Firefox 3 to be faster
and more stable than any other browsers on my system.  Safari 3.1 is pretty
great, though.

Gears, on the other hand, is only supported by Firefox (and requires
users to install Gears themselves), while HTML 5's offline storage is
available out of the box in Safari 3.1, which is now being pushed out
to Windows users everywhere. My point isn't that using Gears is a bad
idea, but that offline database storage is pretty new and some way
away from widespread use.

I don't want to get into a big argument about HTML 5; that's well
beyond the scope of this discussion. I would note, however, that the
specific section under discussion is at the "last call for comments"
stage, meaning that it's relatively mature.

The basic idea being discussed here, using offline storage to speed up
WordPress access, is an excellent one which I would love to see taken
further. However, the two implementations we've discussed thus far
have barriers to their use (specifically, availability) which make me
wary of supporting their inclusion in the WordPress core. At this
stage writing a plugin, which could be later included in WP's core
code if these features become more widespread, seems a more prudent
course (especially given various core developers' stated desire to
keep the WP core lean and mean, and Matt's point that WP should follow
technical adoption--e.g. of PHP5--not try to lead it).

Just FYI, gears supports Firefox and IE 6.0+.

It might be helpful to develop for one system with extensibility in mind and
then later expand it for others.  I'd vote for Gears since I don't like
Safari ;).

I believe Firefox 3's offline storage support is also HTML 5-compatible.

An alternative would be to use a framework that supports multiple storage
providers, such as Dojo Storage.

http://manual.dojotoolkit.org/WikiHome/DojoDotBook/Book50

"Right now the dojo.storage system includes three storage providers, a Flash
Storage Provider that uses a hidden Flash applet; a WHAT WG Storage Provider
that uses native client-side storage abilities in Firefox 2; and a File
Storage Provider that uses the native file system if a web app is loaded
from the local file system."

'm not 100% clear on what you trying to do, or perhaps why you want to
use WP to do it, but you could certainly use my tdo-mini-forms[1]
plugin to do part of this. You could create a form with the plugin
that only registered users can access. You can control access by role.
It has file upload capability and you can have admins (or another more
powerful role) notified by email when a user submits a post (which
would be a obituary).  But other then that, I don't know how you can
put something together quickly with existing plugins.

This is just my two cents, but this doesn't sound as much of a typical CMS-based site as much as it is a custom, interactive-centric site that is best served by a custom script, built for the job.

I get that you already have a WP in place, just bear in mind the old adage "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"

Perhaps your (boss's) interests would be best served by taking a different approach on this matter?

 >>Perhaps your (boss's) interests would be best served by taking a

Yes.

That's why I was asking first.  We're already considering other options. 
  But if WP can do it, and it's already in place, then why not use it? 
That's the approach we are taking.  If it doesn't work, then it doesn't, 
and we'll pursue the other options we already have in mind.  But the 
point of the question (as stated) was to see if it's possible in 
WordPress.  We already understand it's not our only option.

Which, by the way - thanks to everyone for your replies.  A couple of 
them look like they will actually work very well - we're trying them out 
right now :)

That's great - and only something that you can decide; seeing as only you know what you can afford to hack and what you can afford to re-write. We can offer advice, but it is for you to decide that even if WP _can_ be used to accomplish this where it _should_ in your particular case.

Good luck.

Well, you could conceivably abstract your storage and then make it
work with Gears, HTML5, or whatever. Doesn't make any difference. When
given alternate choices, and one is not clearly better, abstract your
design and allow for both of them, possibly as plugins.

Anyway, let's ignore the "how" of it for now, because the "what"
strikes me as more interesting.

What, exactly, would make the most sense to store in this client side
storage system? How would "syncing" it occur?

Simple use case I can think of:

1) Drafts & Media uploads, likely.  Anything necessary to create a
post, basically.

2) Pull from Gears -> Create post draft -> publish.  We already do
something similar with the XMLRPC engine, why not extend it in some
fashion to Gears?

That's what's stumped me. (FWIW I've had Brad Neuberg's "Moxie" 
bookmarked on my toolbar for what seems like years. Haven't found a use 
for it.)

The 1 application that has come to mind is some sort of though-liner (an 
outliner / scratch-pad / composing tool) ... Broderbund's "Thinking Cap" 
was best of breed (mid-80s) and few tools since have replicated that 
function set.

Sorting snippets locally ... cutting/copying/pasting together a very 
rough draft ... when it reaches something like draft quality, upload to 
the blog. Continue working on local copy and then sync?

Is the idea to create an offline blog client that is part of the

Hello all,

I've searched everywhere (obviously unsuccessful in finding answers)
for a way to unpublish all posts by a particular author at one time.
How might I go about doing this? Anyone know of a plugin or database
hack or ...?

Thank you in advance for your help.

I'm guessing something like

UPDATE `wp_posts` SET `post_status`='draft' WHERE
`post_author`=<INSERT ID OF AUTHOR HERE>

would do the trick :)

I know you can delete the author - when you do that, it'll ask you if 
you want all the posts by that author deleted, or attributed to someone 
else.

'Course, if you want to *keep* them (just un-publish them) then that 
won't work for you.  But if you want to totally get rid of them, you 
could do that.  Then, if you want to keep the author around, you can 
re-create him.

That'd be my vote, yes.  MarsEdit in a browser, as it were.

Subject: [wp-hackers] DB_COLLATE is not used in searches
Message-ID: <47EA010E.6070203@gmail.com>

Testing WP-2.1RC1 I found that the collation set in "wp-config.php" 
(DB_COLLATE) is not being used in searches. I think it should.

This can easily be fixed. In "wp-includes/query.php" the following part 
can be changed as indicated here:

// If a search pattern is specified, load the posts that match
if ( !empty($q['s']) ) {

   // [...]

   foreach((array)$q['search_terms'] as $term) {
     $term = addslashes_gpc($term);
     // The following like has been added
     if ($wpdb->collate) $collatesql = ' COLLATE ' . $wpdb->collate;
     // The following line has been changed
     // $collatesql was inserted in two places
     $search .= "{$searchand}(($wpdb->posts.post_title LIKE 
'{$n}{$term}{$n}'$collatesql) OR ($wpdb->posts.post_content LIKE 
'{$n}{$term}{$n}'$collatesql))";
     $searchand = ' AND ';
   }

   // [...]
}

There is probably a more general way to fix this, but the above
simple solution should also work.

Thanks for your replies. The address for the ajax call is correct. As I
said, _sometimes_ the AJAX call works and _sometimes_ a 404 error is
returned - on the same blog!

I've only seen this error once on my own WP test installation but it seems
to happen quite often for some of the Exec-PHP users. We already tried to
nail it down to interfering third party plugins but the 404 error still
occured once all other plugins in the blog were disabled.

I doubt that the 404 error was generated by the web server because in this
case wp-admin/admin-ajax.php should have been temporarily missing in the
file system?!? So at the moment I am searching for cases were WordPress
itself generates a 404 in case of AJAX calls on the admin site.

A very small number of my users are experiencing what sounds like a  
similar problem (although in my case I use 'ahah') and it is happening  
on both the front and back ends. Every call results in a 404. So far  
we have established the following:

	- The URLS to the php code file in the call are 100% accurate.
	- The php code files being called ARE actually actioned.
	- This only happens with any permalink structure. Use none/default  
and it behaves.
	- Trace it with WireShark and the resultant HTML from the AHAH call  
IS returned.
	- Watch it in Firebug and there is the resultant HTML shown in  
Firebug but on the screen above is a 404 report!
	- There appears to be no common denominator in terms of server/ 
versions/plugins/themes/php etc.
	- As above, this is not a conflict with another plugin - it is  
something coming from the WP code (all on 2.3.x)

And it is driving me and 7 users nuts!
If anyone has any clues as to what is causing this the information  
would be welcomed.
Andy

Subject: [wp-hackers] Should "view site" link to home or blog?
Message-ID: <47EA268C.1010707@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

Most of my sites use the blog as the homepage. But one busy site has a 
static page as the home page, and the blog is on another page. When I 
click "view site" after doing something in the admin, 90% of the time I 
want to view the blog.

So I pose the question, should the view site link point to the blog, if 
the site is "paged"?

Cheers - Callum.

I say do it as a plugin, or make it optional, this would disadvantage
users who do't use the blog featue of wordpress, and use it as a CMS.

Indeed. It's "View Site", not "View Blog".

Totally plugin territory.

Are you referring to the spam links that begin with (for example)  
google.com/?

A lot of spammers are running links through google references and such  
because people have learned not to click on links to unknown web  
sites; but... "Hey I use Google all the time -- that's not spam!"   
*click*

Another trick is www.google.com.blahblah.cz/ or such.  Non-techies  
don't always recognize that this is not Google. *click*

Hope that answers the question, highly off-topic though it is.

Nothing happens for me on either WordPress 2.3.3 or trunk.  What
happens on your install, and could it be caused by a plugin?

Nothings  happens... obviously... but Google refer this as a potentia
dangerous URL (even if not) and it's annoying.. an no it's not a
plugin! I perfeclty know it's not dangerous at all etc... but it's
something with non sense... for that i'm asking a way to solve it in a
future versione of WP.

What is the problem you are trying to solve?
Why would a link like that ever show up in Google search results, and
if a link like that were to appear in Google search results, why do
you think WordPress could do anything about it?

Cause if ref parma is used for internal purpose only or refer only to
local url this fake url shoudl be killed and giving a 301 redirect to
a clena URL willmake this fake URL disappear.

But i would like to hear somenthing from developper not casual
users... sorry

I feel like there is a communication problem here. However, as far as I 
can tell (and I looked through the code), WordPress does NOT use the 
'ref' URL parameter. However, some plugins DO use it. For example, 
Firestats will use it as the referrer if it is present. This actually 
surprised me a little, because it opens firestats up to referrer spam. 
Basically, worst case scenario, you could have "recent referrers" linked 
to on your site (using FireStats), and these people could get a link. 
However, you shouldn't be doing this anyway.

In any case, since WordPress doesn't use it, you would be safe to use 
something like .htaccess to correct the URLs and pass a 301. Just keep 
in mind that while WordPress will still work fine, some plugins may not.

Yes, but it could be done in differentiating get_the_content('') and
the_content filters, probably by adding a filter in between, in
wp_trim_excerpt.
	function wp_trim_excerpt($text) { // Fakes an excerpt if needed
		global $post;
		if ( '' == $text ) {
			$text = get_the_content('');
			$text = apply_filters('wp_trim_excerpt', $text);
			$text = apply_filters('the_content', $text);
			$text = str_replace(']]>', ']]&gt;', $text);
			$text = strip_tags($text);
			$excerpt_length = 55;
			$words = explode(' ', $text, $excerpt_length + 1);
			if (count($words) > $excerpt_length) {
				array_pop($words);
				array_push($words, '[...]');
				$text = implode(' ', $words);
			}
		}
		return $text;
	}
Many plugins use 'the_content' filter. But, let's say you want to replace a
tag like <youtube> and gain control over how it's done in the excerpt, you
have to use workarounds to achieve it.

Just throwing this idea out there in case anyone wanted an idea for a
WP GSoC project, or indeed just because it would be cool.

Now the automatic plugin upgrade system is in 2.5 (well, almost) a
great thing to add to the Plugins screen would be a WordPress.org
Plugins Directory [1] browser. It could allow users to see the most
popular plugins, browse by tag, search, (all using AJAX and the host
of RSS feeds on WP.org) and of course -- the killer feature -- one
click installation using the built-in plugin upgrade functionality!

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6015
I've been intending to apply for SOC this year, So far i've not had the time to though..

I was hoping that 2.5 would be released before the SoC applications started, So that most people could get a look at the automatic upgrader before mentioning installing from wordpress.org
(RC2 is out btw: http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/ but go ahead and use SVN too)

What I invisioned would be a Set of side tabs(allthough it'd most likely be horizontal header tabs) to select the location to pull plugins from, eg:
| Popular | Featured | Recently Updated | Latest | Search |
(And there'd be a plugin hook on those, so with a plugin, you could either remove some tabs, or add your own, that'd mean highly customised installs could setup a internal location to install plugins from for example)

and then a table much like the plugins table in 2.5, With an Install action instead of Activate/edit

The search tab would allow you to search by tags, search terms, or Plugin name.
Given theres a few thousand plugins in some tags, It'd need to have paging support, say 20-40 plugins shown at a time (Seems high to some, but keep in mind when skimming over a long lis of plugins, there'll be many your not interested in at all) possibly with an ajaxified loading of next page data, allthough it might be better for user experience for it to be an actual pageload, that way on slower connections, allthough theres more headers, the plugins list shows up gradually rather than a huge wait and chunk.

It'd require a new api on wordpress.org as well, RSS feeds just dont cut it for anything other than featured/latest/popular, which I'd be happy to write up providing someone gave me a crash course on bbpress :P

Any opinions from anyone?

Especially as more and more functionality gets bundled into themes, for

browsable within the installation, installable in a couple of

So now all we need http://wordpress.org/extend/themes and a
corresponding API to call to.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Google SoC 2008 Proposal: Movable Type / TypePad
	AtomPub Importer
Message-ID: <eff2e86c0803261851r6cd19aaegc32e6d4d23adcd9d@mail.gmail.com>

After reflecting upon the different viewpoints of my last proposal, I
figured it would be a good idea to come up with another proposal. So, I
propose creating an AtomPub-based content importer for Movable Type and
TypePad.


* What is AtomPub?


AtomPub is an established standard for editing web resources (RFC5023).
Through AtomPub, content and media can be retrieved and edited with ease.
Many content management systems have started implementing the standard,
including WordPress as of version 2.3. Movable Type and TypePad, the
targeted import environments, have added official support as of the
beginning of this year.


* What would an AtomPub-based Movable Type / TypePad Importer Bring to
WordPress?


The number one added benefit of an AtomPub-based importer would be
convenience. Currently, importing from Movable Type / TypePad requires an
export file to be created. While uploading this file is easy enough, the
process could be simplified.


By importing through AtomPub, only the URL location of the former blog and
login credentials are needed; similar to the way the current Blogger
importer works. The importer would be able to retrieve all required content
information and complete the process with a single click, entirely over the
internet.


* My Proposed Solution


- Import all content information (posts, pages, categories, tags, etc) from
an AtomPub-based Movable Type / TypePad installation in as few clicks as
possible.


- Investigate providing a media import option. This option, if feasible,
would import all media (pictures, etc) from a TypePad / Movable Type
installation into WordPress 2.5's new media manager, coping the content to
/wp-content as needed.


- Investigate the possibility of extending AtomPub-based importers to other
blogging platforms.


* Additional Information


AtomPub RFC Spec: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5023.txt


WordPress' AtomPub Support: http://codex.wordpress.org/AtomPub


Movable Type's Announcement of AtomPub Support:
http://www.movabletype.org/2007/12/atompub_support_and_new_edit_a.html

I'm not following you there. If you want to change something in the
excerpt, you have both the_excerpt and get_the_excerpt filters. What's
wrong with those?

Ok now it's all clear... infact i seached the code for ref ussage but
I didn't find nothing, then the only way is to filter it in .htaccess
if any plugin is using it.

Thanks a lot

"wp_head" is too late for queuing; you need to do it earlier, perhaps at "init."

Very true.

There doesn't seem to be an easy way to do it via a plugin. However, it 
might be an idea to have two links. View Site | Blog. Or something of 
that ilk.

Anyway, it's not a high priority.

I don't suppose there's a 'wp_init' action is there?

Perhaps you want "template_redirect."

You mentioned using AJAX for this kind of functionality, but wouldn't that
be a little overkill?
IMO, another suggestion is to use an iframe? OR

can the Plugins/Themes Directory have an xml file that automatically updates
when new themes/plugins are accepted in the directory. In that xml file,
it'll have things like name, author, version, link for download etc..

Then, all we'd have to do for the self-hosted blogs is create a new tab(s)
in the admin, and in that page, create a script that'll loop through all the
xml file to generate a list from that xml file.

This could be a great plugin if creating that xml file is possible. Let me
know if I'm totally off, or missing something...

I'm not sure that's correct - I've always used:

add_action('wp_head',  wp_enqueue_script('jquery') );

Which _just works_.  Putting it inside a function (as Austin did)
never works for me.

That works because you're just calling wp_enqueue_script('jquery').
The add_action at that point is meaningless.

add_action takes two string parameters. The first one is the action
name. But the second one is the name of the function to call. In this
case, you're actually calling wp_enqueue_script('jquery'), and it
returns false/null/zero/nothing, which you then pass to the add_action
function.

So no, your code is wrong. Simply using wp_enqueue_script('jquery');
at that position would have the same effect.

I'm still not sure why sites add that ref parameter, but if you know
you don't have any plugins using it, then this will eliminate it from
your site and, eventually, from Google:

RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \?(ref=.*)?\ HTTP [NC]
RewriteRule .? http://example.com%{REQUEST_URI}? [R=301,L]

The idea is that when somebody makes a link to your site with the
ref=whatever parameter, you perm redirect them to the real URL. Google
will then follow these links, see the perm redirect, and change its
own indexes accordingly. No more ref=spammer sites listed for you in
Google.

It just works probably because jQuery is loaded by default or by another 
plugin.

Proof of concept: add and activate this plugin

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: An Enqueue Test
Plugin URI: #
Description: Blah
Author: Ozh
Version: 0.0
Author URI: #
*/
add_action ('init', 'enqueue_test');
function enqueue_test() {
        wp_enqueue_script(
                'enqueue_test',
                'http://blah/enqueue.js'
        );
}

?>

This will add into the <head> a call to http://blah/enqueue.js

Now, modify the add_action with 'wp_head' (or with 'admin_header' if 
you're working in the admin area) instead of 'init' : won't add anything.

As I understand it (didn't really dig into these parts of code) you need 
to pick a hook before any output is started. 'init' or 'plugins_loaded' 
are fine, 'template_redirect' is fine too for the blog area (but obviously 
not the admin area)
'wp_head' is too late.

I suggested this (found on wp.org forum) to the user that asked me
about this problem in the italian forum but he says it doesnt' works..
and iwe weren't able to find what the hell he did to make it not
functioning cause was just necessary to change the URL with theone of
the blog... 

Thanks a lot too :)

Well, it definitely works, but with default permalinks (?p=XX and
such), it will only redirect you to the blog's homepage, not to the
individual single pages.

Really back-of-the-dinner-napkin here, but I've been thinking about
how we now have a Comments bubble notifying us of issues needing our
attention.  I would LOVE something similar for the plugins (and
eventually for themes) but I think additions to api.wordpress.org
would make the entire thing VERY compelling.

Here's what I think needs fleshing out: additional plugin/theme update
metadata.  i.e., the Plugins screen (and something in the
Dashboard/top nav links, ideally) shouldn't just notify a blog admin
that there are updates out there, but also what /sorts/ of updates are
available.  Feature updates are /very/ different than security ones
and can/should therefore be handled differently by theme authors,
plugin devs and blog admins alike.  So there should be some way for
devs/authors to note what sort of update
(bugfix/feature/security/etc.) a release is and perhaps even the
severity of the update, in the case of security ones.

I'd also love a "Don't bug me about this release again, just tell me
next time ANOTHER release is available" button per plugin update, but
that's way down the list.

Isn't there going to be something on the Dashboard telling you updates
are available for your plugins? There should almost certainly be.

I'm really loving this move of making the API much richer and
therefore making adding plugins and themes incredibly intuitive for
anyone. Just select, click, password and install.

I've been thinking of writing a patch to put a little notification bubble
above "plugins" like the comments has.  I won't if everyone thinks that's a
stupid idea.  Also, I haven't checked trac to see if anyone else has done
that yet.  I've been a bit busy being a tourist.

*Haven't checked if this exists"

Slug creates a text string from Title, yes?

Could there be a function that, when enabled, automatically produced a 
text block "excerpt" from the post contents?
I imagine it having a configurable length, so that, say, the first 24 
words were selected and displayed as an excerpt, followed by something 
like "[...] --more--"
And perhaps, like slug, that text block would be accessible for editing.

It's because those filters (the_excerpt and get_the_excerpt) are applied
after the content filters. Therefore, whatever is built inside the content
has to be unbuild if you want the excerpt to not apply the same changes.

I'm really still not seeing the problem with that. What exactly are
you wanting to do that is so difficult here?

wp_trim_excerpt is basically gutting the post anyway. It's cutting out
all html tags of any sort, trimming down to the first 55 words, etc.
The whole point of it is basically to take a formatted post and
totally munge it up into some simple text. An excerpt can't contain
HTML or anything else that isn't text anyway (it would break the RSS
feed). So, what, exactly, are you wanting to do?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Limit a user to write just 10 posts
Message-ID: <24C268CF88BC4AF28FE00916E51978D2@gmcosta>

I'm trying to do a plugin to limit a user to post only (a number of posts determined and changeble by me).
I'm using wordpress 2.3.3 with Role Manager latest version, and Custom Write Panel.
I created a role with a custom capability to let that role access the Custom Write Panel.

When the user try to access the Custom Write Panel to post something, the plugin has to check if the user has wrote more than the allowed posts by the plugin.
If the write post limit it's more than allowed, the wordpress doesn't show de the custom write panel and doesn't let the user add posts.

How I'm studyng php so I tryed to create something but it became a mass.
Any one could give me a hand on this, or try to give me some links to get this work?
Thanks for all.

THE CODE it's bellow:

/*Plugin Name: UPA Users Posts Allowed */

block_post_write() {
remove_cap('job', 'edit_posts');
remove_cap('job', 'upload_files');
remove_cap('job', 'imovel');
echo '<p>You does not have permission to write a new post. Call the administrator of the site to get permission again. Thank you!</p>';
}

add_action('publish_post', 'limit_post_write');

function limit_post_write(){
$user_total_posts_wrote = get_usernumposts($user->ID);
if($user_total_posts_wrote >= 3) {
$block = block_post_write();
echo $block;
return block_post_write();
}
}

I've been looking for documentation on utilizing the new WP 2.5 UI, but I
can't find anything. I've managed to hack together some stuff my looking at
the source code, but I'm wondering if there's any documentation out there
that would help me in my quest for consistent GUI-ness (not to be confused
with Guinness, which is also good) or if there's a plan in release such
documentation?

I did most of my plugins work thanks to Joost de Valk's post:

http://www.joostdevalk.nl/wordpress-25-plugin-settings-pages-style-guide/

Probably there's something else to do, but this is a starting point. I  
think that some kind of guidelines will be released at some point, but  
surely not before 2.5 is out :-)

Actually, it's relatively easy even though there's no direct filter.

Hook in at "admin_head" and add a filter to "pre_option_home". Inside the
function for that filter, do remove_filter( 'pre_option_home',
'yourfunction' ) so it won't run again and then do return $whatevervalue.

If that becomes core, I think it's worth having a '2' in that bubble  
in the official releases - to tell users, especially ones fresh to  
wordpress, that there are such things as plugins, and you already have  
two!

I saw that too, I wanted to do stuff that emulated the boxes on the "write"

I've found that including the following code in header:

wp_enqueue_script('postbox');
wp_enqueue_script('post');


And then using:

<div class="postbox">
     <h3>Example Heading Title</h3>
     <div class="inside">
          //Content here
     </div>
</div>

...allows me to get the nice collapsible boxes. I'm currently working on how
to get a the mini side bar on the right.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC Proposal: OpenID core implementation
Message-ID: <47EC2E87.4000201@gmail.com>

Hi,

My proposal is about the implementation of OpenID authentication into 
wordpress core.

== What is OpenID ==

OpenID is a decentralized identity, free and open standard that allows 
users to log on to multiple sites using a single digital identity, 
eliminating the need for different credentials for each site the user 
participates.

== How wordpress would benefit from this ==

Using OpenID as authentication method users could have only one 
credential for multiple wordpress blogs breaking a wall in user 
interaction thereby removing the trouble of needing to register for 
posting a comment, this would be further applied to all N blogs read by 
the user.

== My Project Proposal ==

Although there are plugins for OpenID (WP-OpenID), the core 
implementation could extend this feature and future plugins 
(implementing other features) could benefit from this.

The implementation will have three modes of operation:
   disabled - the OpenID authentication is disabled.
   dual - both standard user authentication and OpenID can be used.
   exclusive - only OpenID authentication for both users and administrators.

The OpenID users will be exposed to the same features (if compatible) 
that standard users have, like comment auto-approval.
Themes Template changes to support OpenID on comments box.

OpenID user control, you can ban a user for inappropriate behaviour or 
ban it for spam, although in the time being there are no reports of 
openid based spam, but it could happen in the future. This spam-ban list 
could be exposed so that other wordpress blogs could request it and 
update their own openid users spam list, using an RPC or simply a GET 
method, creating a mesh network for keeping friendly blogs updated (and 
warn the openid provider).

Possible additional contributions (time permitting):
- In exclusive mode, user registration will create an openid for the new 
user, using myopenid API or other openid provider.
- Microformat hCard generation on the default About page.

All the configuration will be available through the options panel on the 
wordpress administration.

This will bring native wordpress support for the next generation of user 
management and authentication.

== Information ==

myOpenID - openid provider - http://www.myopenid.com
Wikipedia article - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID

Any thoughts ?
Will be glad to hear some suggestions.

Thanks!

Best regards,
- Artur Goul?o Ferreira

Hey Adam,

All the info you could ever possibly need (almost) is at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress . Don't forget
that as well as writing code, lots of very important contributions
come in the form of confirming bug reports by reproducing them,
writing documentation (both in Codex and PHPdoc in the core), and
testing the latest changes to trunk.

Don't forget to hop over to the #wordpress channel on IRC too!

John.

Maybe its just K2 (getk2.com) but I can't seem to use is_page('2') to  
test for the page I've set using the Options > Reading > "Posts page"  
option.

Is there a way to tell what page you're on when using this setting?

Guessing:

is_page() && $wp_query->get_queried_object_id == get_option('page_on_front')

Oops, typo. I meant:

is_page() && $wp_query->get_queried_object_id() == get_option('page_on_front')

But there's this:

is_front_page()

If you want to know whether you're on the posts page, use

$wp_query->is_posts_page

There ought to be a function...

Now that I have jQuery loaded for some reason I'm having problems
initializing jQuery.  I have no idea why.  Below is the code I use and
the error I get.  I am sure jQuery is indeed being loaded correctly.

add_action('wp_head', 'postinfo_head');

function postinfo_head() {

+1. Would be useful for "supporting" importing from other blog engines
without actually having to "support" them.

jQuery in WordPress uses the noConflict option to prevent issues with  
Prototype.

You need to use jQuery(document)... or one of the other fancy functions  
such as this:

function($){
$(document)..
}(jQuery);
(I think thats how you do it.. Check online for jQuery.noConflict())

add_meta_box() is an easier way of doing that and will protect you
from any box markup changes that happen in the future.

I think you can create your own jquery instance if you fear conflict  
from other  plugins that may be working within the same instance.

var joequery = jQuery.noConflict();
joequery(document).ready( function() {
   joequery('#log').text( 'Howdy' );
}

RCs Betas etc. are not normally tagged.

I would get on the revision at which the version.php file changed.

Purely a semantic point on my part, but I've actually been bothered by
the RC notation this time around.  The versions of trunk/ that I've
seen HAVEN'T been "release-worthy", thus the notion of labeling them
RC1, RC2, etc. is pretty off-putting.  I'd rather we stuck with the
"beta" appellation next time around, if possible.

The only conflicts come from the fact that both Prototype and jQuery use
'$'. If you instead opt to use the 'jQuery' object instead of '$',
there's no need to assign it a special variable like 'joequery'. Just
use jQuery for everything:
?
        ?jQuery(document).ready( function() {
           jQuery('#log').text( 'G\'day' );
        }

Or you can define $ as jQuery just within a limited namespace if you want to:

jQuery(function($) {
    $('#log').text('howdy');  // here $ is jQuery
});
// here $ could be Prototype

I'd really have to dig for it. And of course this is more of a jquery  
list discussion and badly off topic.

I ran into some conflict at some point somewhere with a "jquery  
plugin" in use by a "wordpress plugin" that conflicted with the usage  
of another (or same.. cant remember ) "jquery plugin" in use by a  
"wordpress theme" ( Hurra for Web 2.xxx! )

Anyway.. At the time the only way I could solve it ( without rewriting  
the original wordpress plugin ) was when jquery went to 1.2.3? and had  
to use joequery = jQuery.noConflict(); I should probably look at again  
with y'all's  tips.

Thanks,
Jess

Looking at the phpDoc and based on what Ozh said, it looks like
add_meta_box() only works for hooking into existing edit pages (such as the
write post, write page, or link page), true?

What can I do to have the look and feel on an added management/settings
page?

(Sorry if you get two copies of this.  I think the earlier one  
disappeared into the ether....)

Hi --

I'm trying to write a widget that calls text from a Custom Field on a  
page.  I'm using the Sandbox theme.  What I want is for the widget to  
display the custom field's content if present.  Here's what I have:

function widget_show_page_index($args) {
	extract($args);
	rewind_posts();
	if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post();
		if(get_post_custom_values('thisPageIndex')) {
			$toc_list = get_post_meta($post->ID, 'thisPageIndex', true);
			echo $before_widget;
			echo $before_title . 'On This Page' . $after_title;
			echo $toc_list}
			echo $after_widget;
		}
	endwhile; else:
		echo "<p>Nothing found.</p>";
	endif;
}

The "if (have_posts())" never returns True.  I've tried it with and  
without query_posts() -- makes no difference.  What am I missing here?

The "Not Found" shows up in the sidebar; so I know I'm at least  
calling the widget itself properly.  (That's just there for testing.)

Yes, I know I should preferably be using a new WP_Query object.  One  
thing at a time -- get it working then make it pretty... unless  
somebody has a snippet that will do it all in one go. :)

Thanks all,

Stephen

Well, first, it's not efficient, on a performance stand point, to create a
content and then undo it.
But the thing is, the tag stripping doesn't take off everything. If you add
content or scripts, the wp_trim_excerpt will not withdraw it from the
result.

That was my guess too. Based on commit notes, I think RC2 was r7521  
and RC1 was r7408.

WP 2.5 appears to have been released this morning but hasn't been  
tagged yet. It's r7566?

SVN copies are very lightweight, it would seem like a good practice to  
keep snapshots of all named releases, even dev milestones, noted  
somewhere. If for nothing more than the history of the project.

Congrats on releasing 2.5, this is a big one,

joe

I agree. Here is my version of this function:

function is_posts_page () {
	global $wp_query;

	return $wp_query->is_posts_page;
}

But the more I played with this, the more I realized I needed more  
than just this.

For one, and this may be by design, but there is nothing to test  
whether this feature turned on or not, except by testing  
get_option('page_for_posts') - which returns the ID if this option is  
turned on, and nothing if it doesn't (because the entry in the DB is  
either there or not). A more 'authoritative' test function may be  
warranted.

There is a function get_page_link, but yet you can't get the link from  
the page object (get_page(get_option('page_for_posts'),OBJECT)), as  
guid was empty when I played with it. So it means that when you want  
to build a menu item for a page, it looks something like this:

$posts_page = get_page(get_option('page_for_posts'),OBJECT);
<a href="<?php echo get_page_link(get_option('page_for_posts')); ?>"  
title="<?php echo $posts_page->post_title; ?>"><?php echo $posts_page- 
 >post_title; ?></a>

And last but not least, wp_list_pages doesn't seem to allow you to  
apply css or other attributes to the output. If I could do this, and  
do this selectively (i.e. by page ID, similar to exclude) I probably  
wouldn't have needed the other hackery to make this work, as all I  
wanted to do was apply .current_page_item to the posts page menu item  
in my theme.

Am I just missing something and there is an easier way to do this, or  
do I just have a special case WP can't handle elegantly yet?

Thanks for all your help so far,

Message-ID: <e9f3ce460803291306h17a275e4ib6293f1fb4d51779@mail.gmail.com>

Since upgrading to 2.5, my fairly simple plugin no longer works. While
I can access all the "pages" via (/?a_variable=blah), the mod_rewrite
element does not work at all (/blah/).

1. What changes have been made to the Wordpress mod_rewrite that means
this may well be the case?

2. Here is the code in question http://pastebin.com/f799c4f97. What is
going on here then?

Really want to upgrade, but can't do so.

Downgrading to the last version makes it work again fine, apart from I
can't login, because the passwords are messed up.

Thanks very much indeed.

Alex

Perhaps cached CSS from the old site?  I'm using Firefox 2.0.0.13 and  
the front forum page looks normal.

Nope, I already did a hard clear of browser cache, it was still that 
way. I took that screen shot AFTER the hard clear of cache of done and

Yeah, I can reproduce this on FF 2.0.0.12 on OS X, as well as Safari
3.1. Looks like the top-level divs need a min-width of 960px or so
setting on them.

$wp_rewrite->rules = $wp_rewrite->rules + $new_rules;
change to:
$wp_rewrite->rules = $new_rules + $wp_rewrite->rules;

Theres a new Greedy Rewrite rule which eats unmatched URL's for breakfast.
I think there might be some API which can be used now which will prevent  
things like that happening, only i'm not sure of what the API is right now.
Heres a ticket with a workaround, Or you can just change the array  
additions like above. http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6110

the software itself is incredible! The interface is so clean and easy

Hello,

a little bit late to discuss this, but I would like to apply for this year's
GSoC to work on implementing multiple RDBMS support for WordPress. This
could be done by moving all vendor-specific SQL functionality
to classes, which inherit from a common interface (WPDB).
Therefore, all scripts which interact with the database will do it
through an abstracion layer, like follows:


$query = $wpdb->construct_select(array('user_login', 'user_email'),
$wpdb->users, 'username = ?');
$results = $wpdb->query($query, array($username));

What are your thoughts?

One minor complaint in the admin CSS from the point of view of writing  
plugins:

	#wpcontent select {
		font: 12px/20px "Lucida Grande", "Lucida Sans Unicode", Tahoma,  
Verdana, sans-serif;
		padding: 2px;
		border-width: 1px;

		height: 2em;		<=======
		vertical-align:top;
	}

Having just spent a couple of hours trying to work out why my select  
boxes are suddenly ignoring their size setting.
This should have really been wrapped in a class.

You could always post a ticket on Trac with a patch, you know.

Yes. I do know.
But it's not really a simple patch is it? The CSS file can be patched  
but that doesn't solve all the instances of select boxes in the admin  
which should have a class added.
My intention was really to be informative to others.

In earlier versions I could just take out <div id="devnews"></div> and <div

did this on client installations.

In version 2.5 this seems much more difficult. How would I go about it now?
I know you can change the feed, but what I want is less information on that

I would also suggest reintroducing the "edit" link for recent comments 
in the dashboard.php (row 282)

// Added by Dino Termini: I want also be able to directly edit a comment 
from here
$comment_dino_edit = '<a class="comment-link" href="' . 
get_edit_comment_link() . '">'.__('edit').'</a>';
$comment_meta = sprintf( __( 'From <strong>%1$s</strong> on %2$s %3$s' ) 
. ' (%4$s)', get_comment_author(), $comment_post_link, $comment_link, 
$comment_dino_edit );

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP internal cache?
Message-ID: <47EFB321.4030508@timbury.net>

I must be missing something very basic here.
WP is installed on my server (linux/apache/mysql/php).
I'm editing php theme files using vi on linux via ssh.
I make a change in the file and nothing shows in the
browser (Firefox2 & 3, Opera9). Clear the browser cache,
restart mysql, restart apache, refresh page and nothing happens!
Wtf? :(  Am I overlooking something very simple? Does WP have
some internal caching mechanism? Can I turn it off? This is
really painful! Example:

original page.php:
                <h1><?php the_title(); ?></h1>

About page displays: About

edited page.php:
               <h1><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
                <h1>WP is killing me!</h1>

About page displays: About

No "WP is killing me!" ever shows up. But it might if I wait until
tomorrow sometime.... arggghhh!

Thanks in advance!
Tim

Generally, it's easy to get in the wrong directory on the server since 
the default and classic theme folders usually are there, too. So you 
want to make sure that you are editing the right file. ;-)

The only other thing I can think of is the sidebar. If you are using 
widgets, changes to the sidebar.php probably won't show up on the page. 
But h1 doesn't look like the sidebar...

Any caching of the whole page, I think, would have to be enabled by you. 
Either via a plugin or in the wp-config.php (!?). So these are the 
places that you could check if any caching is used. Apart from that... 
Any kind of proxy server involved?!

Bye,
Johannes

Yep, I was just about to recommend the !important selector, or
ensuring that your sheet comes last with the same selector.

Johannes,

Thanks for the quick reply. I had the wp-cache plugin
installed, but de-activated. Unfortunately, the plugin's
admin interface failed to actually change 'true' to 'false'
in wp-config.php. Thanks for saving me from tearing out
the little hair I have left! :)

Sure - workarounds are simple enough but it should get swept up before  
the next update.
If you use the 'size' setting on your select 'height: auto;' would be  
a better bet as that respects the size setting.

Hi,

I've upgraded from 2.3.3 to 2.5 and well went well and is fine, except 
in one point:

After I publish an article, if I later go back, change it and click 
"Save", I get this blank error page with the text:

"Not Acceptable
An appropriate representation of the requested resource 
/wp-admin/page.php could not be found on this server."

Nevertheless, the changes I make, do appear in the blog.

Is this happening to anyone else around here ?

Warm Regards,

A bit of good WP 2.5 UI feedback from a very tech-unsavvy user.

Looks like he's (quite intuitively) clicking on the image icon in the  
main tinymce toolbar, which doesn't provide a Browse function, but  
expects a URL. To browse to an image (surely this is the majority use  
case) you have to click the first Add Media square.  I can see why  
he's confused.

I'd suggest removing the image icon from the toolbar altogether -- the  
Add Media dialog already has a "From URL" field. The Add Image button  
on the main toolbar only serves to confuse.

Just a friendly reminder

Now that 2.5 is out the door please be aware that trunk may go wobbly,
unstable and eat your blog while we implement new stuff and fix complex
bugs.

If you want to track the changes targeted for 2.5.1 then please switch
to branches/2.5 where you will be safe(r).

Message-ID: <9167D4DD-B120-4930-B201-5EE6E3795FCC@anschitech.de>

Hi,

I searched the internet, but found no simple/fast solution.
I want to check if a page has sub-pages to prevent some html being  
displayed.
I have a homemade theme, where I used this line that worked well up  
to WP 2.3.3:

   if(get_page_children($myid, $pages)) :

$myid is populated with the ID of the current page. $pages is empty.

With WP 2.5 I encounter this error:
Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /[server_path]/wp- 
includes/post.php on line 1783

So it seems to me, that there has something changed in 2.5 that  
causes the failure.
Is there any wordpress function that provides only the information  
that a page has children with no unnecessary overhead? I do not want  
to rely on a plugin for my theme to work.

Best Regards,
   Andr?

When you give the plugin updater an FTP account that only has access
to the plugin directory, the plugin updater fails out with:

"Unable to locate WordPress directory."

Should we not allow doing this?

This to me is a huge step in moving towards MVP(C)/n-tier like
architecture.  No one working on the WordPress API should be hand-
coding database table/column names.

Look into creole and propel if you go this route, even just to see
what they've done.  A lot of work has gone into abstracting databases
in PHP5 already, so I'm sure they made a few mistakes and could give
some suggestions.

Yeah, there is a couple of ORM implementations (Doctrine is one besides what
you mentioned).

It could benefit WordPress if
we used one of those libraries for abstraction, as some people have
different database preferences than MySQL.

We had this topic a dozen times (please read the archives[1], guys!),
and I believe that the consensus was that multiple RDBMS support is not
a good idea, mostly because of the fact that it is  preferable to use
the advantages of certain MySQL features over portability to DB systems
that don't meet most of the target audience anyway. Another fact is that
it would also requite plugin authors to write cross platform plugins.
This is not only very hard, because you can't expect them to test on all
major DB systems, but you would again dramatically limit possibilities
(like e.g. using FULLTEXT indices) where it's actually not required.

I'd propose, if you bring this topic up again, you would have to read
the archives (and refer to them, where necessary), and you would have to
bring new and very good arguments for multiple RDBMS support.

I understand your point, but I don't see how this is related to WordPress. At
this moment, WordPress is supporting MySQL versions starting from 4.0,
what means that even half-advanced features like stored procedures and
triggers can't be (and
thus, aren't) used.

Another fact is that

Fulltext indexes
are supported by all major RDBMS'es, but with a different SQL syntax, so a
common wrapper should work in this case.

I'm aware of two
MySQLisms used by WordPress. One are fulltext indexes, which aren't
really MySQL-specific, as I have pointed above, but have
a more varying
syntax for lookups among databases than other common SQL statements.

Another are enum columns, which on other databases can be replaced by
varchars with appropriate domains. Abstracting this shouldn't affect any
code, except for the table creation SQL dump.

It depends what the S3 plugin would do. Care to elaborate further? Do you
plan on hooking in with the existing Media Library and just have the files
stored on S3?

I saw a plugin a while ago that simple put all the uploads on S3.  You
might want to hunt around for that.

Hi everyone!

> http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6457

I noticed something similar with WP 2.3.3 just this week: I create a new 
page and add a custom field without first saving the page. Then I hit 
publish. The page is gone but there is an unpublished draft with the 
custom field but without the content I entered into the page. Very 
annoying when you have to create a lot of pages with custom fields. :-/

I haven't searched in trac though if this is a known problem. Thought 
I'd check this when WP 2.5 is out... Ok, found it:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3700

Now this is rather sad: "Opened 1 year ago". I really have to wonder if 
redoing the design of WP is more important than fixing bugs like this 
one. Bugs that force people to tell customers not to do something 
because of a bug in WP... :-/

Anyway, would these two bugs be related? Sounds like it to me...

Greetings,
Johannes

I would love to use stored procedures and triggers in WP.  The thought
of doing SQL at all inline is less than ideal.  I should be able to
invoke a stored procedure.

Yes, even though this has been talked about before but for good
reason.  Like my new plugin which uses SimpleXML which is much easier
than the PHP4 way of parsing XML.  I was in Barnes and Noble and saw a
book for PHP6!  Now, we're really lagging behind.

If you wanted to just remove the widgets and be done with it, use the
"wp_dashboard_widgets" filter and remove the widgets you don't want from the
array.

See this other, simpler plugin of mine for how to modify that array:

Subject: [wp-hackers] what is the best (fastest) way to check if a page

Something along the lines of this will probably work:

if ( !empty( wp_list_pages( 'echo=0&child_of=' . $post->ID . 'title_li=' ) )
) $children = TRUE;


Similiar code in action: http://www.viper007bond.com/about/
Source:
http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/neat_1024/page-listchildren.phps

It doesn't check for children as I manually assign the Page template, but it
still should give you some ideas.

Hi everyone!

> http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6457

I noticed something similar with WP 2.3.3 just this week: I create a new 
page and add a custom field without first saving the page. Then I hit 
publish. The page is gone but there is an unpublished draft with the 
custom field but without the content I entered into the page. Very 
annoying when you have to create a lot of pages with custom fields. :-/

I haven't searched in trac though if this is a known problem. Thought 
I'd check this when WP 2.5 is out... Ok, found it:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3700

Now this is rather sad: "Opened 1 year ago". I really have to wonder if 
redoing the design of WP is more important than fixing bugs like this 
one. Bugs that force people to tell customers not to do something 
because of a bug in WP... :-/

Anyway, would these two bugs be related? Sounds like it to me...

Greetings,
Johannes

I mean upload files to S3 instead of upload to the server. And also add easy
integration with the entry, for example to upload flv files.

Hey Olexandr,

Do you propose an adapter, factory, or registry pattern for 
accomplishing this? The way your code looks, it looks like what can 
already be done now with replacing the WPDB class with one of your own. 
You would have to do replacements of the SQL.

Also, it appears you are talking about Database *Access* Abstraction 
Layer and SQL Abstraction Layer. The Access Abstraction is already 
accomplished and while pretty damn crappy (you have to support PHP4 you 
know), I do think PDO would kick WPDB ass and probably be a lot faster 
too. However, PDO would not solve your SQL abstraction and your Access 
abstraction is already solved, so there would be no need to do this. 
Unless you wanted to remove the global variable usage and allow for one 
of the above patterns to have the database replacement in a plugin 
instead of in the wp-content folder with a specific name in order to be 
included and replace the current WPDB class.

SQL is not that difficult to learn, therefore it would logical assume 
that if one knows one SQL language, one can also learn another. Given 
that, I think handling RAW SQL instead of arrays would work better. 
However you go about doing so would be interesting. However, I don't 
suggest your current mockup, because I'll hate you for creating 
something so overly complex.

Well, technically it would range from extremely easy but redundant to 
extremely difficult, depending on which method you choose. The plugin 
would just say, this plugin is MySQL only like in other systems I've 
seen. If the user wants another database support, the user can add it 
themselves.

It is a fact, that not coding in strict SQL 92 format and manually 
targetting one RDBMS, allows for better support, quicker development, 
and better optimization.

It is not a fact that it won't meet most target audiences, want about 
companies who already use Oracle and don't want to have to buy a MySQL 
server just to run WordPress? Force them to write their own WPDB class 
and replace the SQL by regular expressions?

It is not a fact that it will require plugin authors to support RDBMS, 
unless it was made a requirement. It would be completely up to the 
plugin developer. If that plugin developer only wanted to support SQLite 
or Oracle, than that would be their priority and audience. If another 
person wanted to add MySQL or another, then it would be added.

Another fact is that it is not very hard depending on how you implement 
it, the current implementations only make it seem that way because they 
abstract everything and hold your hand. That implementation would be 
extremely difficult and not worth the time it would take. An 
implementation that is just an array that WordPress looks for the key 
for the database and pulls that SQL statement out, would be easy, 
however hackish.

I personally, don't care for it, because I don't use any other RDBMS 
other than MySQL and my host doesn't support any other than MySQL.

Also, in the person's defense, it is a lot harder to search for keywords 
on the mailing list than you think. Some people just aren't all that 
good with search keywords which would yield the best results.

I am a proponent of PHP5 as well. WIth the wide use of WordPress, if it
becomes PHP5-only, pretty much all hosts will be supporting it soon :)

But let's get back to the topic, this discussion is about something
a little bit different here.

We could use a factory for instantiating an obect of
proper database-specific WPDB ancestor class. Registry could work for
storing "wpdb" object, but changing to

There are a number of approaches for this, one is to use a "clauses  chain"
like this: $wpdb->select('user_login')->from('users')->where('ID = 1');

Despite this could be a "new" way of writing SQL, we'd still have to support
the old interface.

Agreed on both, but as I said, with the MySQL
feature set used by WordPress, it shouldn't make a huge difference
whether one or multiple databases should be targeted (as
long as all of them understand an SQL dialect).

It is not a fact that it won't meet most target audiences, want about

Replacing SQL by regex would be a quick and dirty solution. It could
also make a some of plugins work
on number databases, but it wouldn't be a good idea in the long run.

Agreed, if developer finds particular database functionality more useful
for his/her plugin than database abstraction, s/he can use it.

What I would suggest to use for now is to split WPDB into two parts. One
would provide database abstraction (query, fetch row, get error etc) and
will be implemented for every supported database.
Another will have the same interface as current WPDB (so it won't break any
plugins) and will be based on calls to the abstraction layer (so it will
have to be implemented just once), instead of
mysql_* functions, as it is done now.

We'd also have to expand WPDB class with a couple of methods,
used for the SQL statements/clauses that have varying syntax among different
databases. As far as I'm aware, WordPress makes use of two such
features: one is fulltext search and another is limit
clause.FOr the former we could have a method fulltext_matches(), which would
return an appropriate WHERE condition.
For the latter, we could use something like:

$result = $wpdb->query(limit('SELECT user_login FROM ' . $wpdb->users . '
ORDER BY user_login', 0, 10));

The implementation for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite would be somewhat
straightforward, and would require some more work for SQL Server and Oracle.

It was suggested that I might get some help with this problem here. 

 

I have a plugin hosted on wordpress.org  - a recent commit apparently borked
the version information that is displayed in the sidebar on the plugin's
home page.  The version info displayed now looks like the entrails of a
printf statement. I've checked the plugin's readme.txt file and the plugin
header and I can't find anything wrong with them;  when I make changes and
recommit - the version info in the sidebar remains unchanged. In addition,
when I look at 'Other Versions' there is a bogus URL for an archive that
also has the printf entrails name.

 

I've done the 'Report a site bug' thing several times over the last week or
so . no joy there. Could someone take a look at this? The plugin page is
here:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-navigation-list-plugin-navt/
- just look at the sidebar.

 

Thanks in advance,
Greg Bellucci

Greg,

two things you may want to fix. Probably this will help make it work:

1). Your readme.txt has DOS line ends. You may want to change this to Unix
line ends.
2). You are using * (the star character) at each first column in the
header of your navt.php file. Remove them and just start with plugin
properties right away.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC Proposal: Caching in core
Message-ID: <6D60F742-1A49-4CFD-AD7F-B2CF86DA6131@neodude.net>

Hi all,
Though I think this has been discussed here before, I'm trying to  
present the whole idea coherently to solicit some more feedback, so I  
hope you'll will bear with another discussion.

Here's the idea: extend the caching API (WP_Object_Cache and  
wp_cache_* funcs) currently in the core. Build an object-caching  
solution persists between requests and limits the cache size by  
invalidating the object with the oldest last-accessed date to make  
space for a new one. Maintain a lookup table, probably as a cached  
array, of 'version' numbers of each table. Hash cached objects with  
which table they come from and its version at the time. When a table  
gets its data changed, bump up the version number; all stale data will  
automatically be inaccessible, and hence removed automatically with  
the last-accessed-date invalidation as above.

(Idea credit: the whole business with versioning tags and tables is  
andy's idea, from
http://andy.wordpress.com/2008/03/01/cache-with-versioned-tags/ )

That's the API. There'll need to be two ways you can extend it: where  
to cache things to (database, memory, file, etc), and what to cache  
(pages, serialized objects, etc).

Next phase: on top of that, build a database-backed object cache  
plugin, shipped with WP, enabled by default. Why? - it's the only  
solution that will work on any setup that will run WP (i.e., no apache/ 
mod_rewrite, no directory write access, etc). There are serious  
performance considerations, which I attempt to address below.

Pre-fetch a set of common objects (maybe pages can hint which objects  
to fetch) to drastically cut down on back-and-forth between the  
database and the cache class. (This maybe should be a feature in the  
API instead, though it should be able to be switched off by the  
storage method - memcached, for example, probably doesn't need  
prefetching.) On each request, remember what, if anything, was  
changed, and bump up the version of the changed tables.

(Another idea: perhaps the hinting data can be collected automatically  
by the caching engine as it gets requests for data. The first time  
each type of page is accessed it would be a little slow, but pretty  
fast from then on. The hints could then be stored in the cache itself  
(or somewhere else more permanent), and this solution would adapt to  
plugins' data access automatically.)

I'm not sure if versioning the caches with *tables* would be feasible  
- I don't know how difficult it will be to trace which tables modified  
data came from. Perhaps a different metric would be better; perhaps  
using the 'groups' in WP_Object_Cache is the logical solution.  
Something to investigate, obviously.

With this, full-page caching becomes feasible, namely by tagging each  
full-page's cache entry with the tables/whatever it depends on. Maybe  
take WP Super Cache, modify it to fit this new API, maybe then ship it  
with WP, disabled by default, as a caching plugin. There's a lot more  
to fiddle with full-page caching; there may be some merit in marking  
sections of a cached page as dynamic (widgets?); then, all pages can  
be cached, and only the truly dynamic data will need to be regenerated  
per hit by the server. I think I might have time to start  
investigating this, but an implementation will probably be out of  
scope of this specific gsoc idea per se.

There's a lot of infrastructure fiddling and community approval with  
this idea; it'll go slow, since caching is tricky to get right, and  
we, of course, want to get it right :)

What do you all think?

Thank you all,
thomas.

I think that a better approach (one I'll probably make use of) could  
be abstracting the whole upload system, letting people choose whether  
upload on the same server, upload via ftp/scp on another one, or use  
external storages like amazon s3. At least, I would probably pay big  
money for this.

One such system, maybe even pluggable, would be probably the  
definitive system, and would act as a foundation layer for many other  
storage systems as well... Too bad I'm too old to propose something  
(and when I was young google didn't spread all this money ;-)

This can be done with Subversion using the svn:eol-style property.

Well, okay, sorry, I meant some of that for Alex, but thanks for replying

Your Factory solution sounds a lot like the one I thought about for 
replacing the hackish kind of method. I do think it would be kind of 
better to extend the WPDB class to get some of the nice methods inside 
of it.

It also sounds like your be reinventing the wheel. However, I do suggest 
you look at the Zend Framework and the DB component to see how they do 
it. You might not learn anything you don't already know, but it would be 
interesting, since they are basically reinventing the wheel also.

I do like the fluid chaining. I use it in a current project with decent 
enough results.

However, I like Alex said, this probably will not be accepted, because 
it will have to support PHP4.3 which is a requirement of WordPress at 
this moment and in order to do a Google Summer of Code project for 
WordPress, it will have to support PHP4.3. Also, it is not probable that 
your project will be included into the core.

If you start coding it now, then by the time PHP5 is the minimum 
requirement, then you'll already have your project finished or mostly 
finished.

Best regards, as a programmer, it does sound extremely fascinating, 
because it is not a project I would do myself (probably use an existing 
framework myself).

Is there anything technical that would stop it from being included as long
as WPDB interface remains backwards-compatible, with several methods added,
and if existing plugins will (at least) remain working with MySQL?

The point here is to introduce database abstraction transparently
without growing WordPress' minimum requirements and breaking existing
plugins.

We could probably reuse database abstraction layer code from CakePHP, which

Should this work if I simple set the properties for the readme.txt and php
file containing the header to


svn:eol-style LF

 

Is that property outbound or inbound? I can't seem to find anything that
discusses which direction the property is for - I assume it's outbound on
the commit.

I set the property on the files and committed them but it didn't seem to
make any difference after the page updated - the version is still borked.
I'm going to run them thru dos2unix to see if that makes a difference.

Fluid Interface. Chaining is the process of returning the reference to 
the same object to allow for the fluid interface pattern.

$mysql = WP_Factory::getDatabase();

$userClause = new WP_Database_Clause();
$userClause->field('username')->equals($username);
$passwordClause = new WP_Database_Clause();
$passwordClause->field('password')->equals($password);

$sql = new WP_Database_Sql();
$sql->select()->columns( array('username', 'somestuff' => 'stuff') 
)->table('user')->join('usermeta')->where($userClause)->and($passwordClause)->limit(5);

$mysql->query($sql);

I only have one technical objection. You'll have to talk to the commit 
team. If they don't want and from past discussions it appears that at 
least Matt doesn't and if you don't impress Matt, then abandon all hope 
ye who tries to get your work committed.

The technical objection to higher abstraction of the RDBMS SQL to allow 
for dynamically converting SQL to any database is slower than anything 
that is hard coded. You gain the advantage of an easier interface 
(arguable). You will have to convince others that your solution wouldn't 
slow down the process as much. You will also have to prove that your 
solution is easier than writing SQL, I'll give you similar arguments 
against using something like Smarty in WordPress.

Other implementations that I've seen tokenize the SQL (in PHP) and build 
up the SQL for any number of RDBMS. Other probably do the find and 
replace method, which is already available.

I didn't care for the last discussion on the subject and I probably 
haven't read every discussion. However, you'll have to read the back 
logs and counter those other arguments.

Okay I see, the WPDB would work as it does now as would any object built 
from it, except a few new methods will be added. Might be a good idea.


In all honestly, I have a few projects that also won't ever be committed 
to core, so I kind of know where you are coming from. I'm just not 
holding my breath on my improvements being committed. At least if the 
code exists, then at some point when the minds of the commit team 
changes on the subject matter, there will be existing work to derive a 
solution from.

The minds of the commit team have changed before, so maybe they'll 
change their minds on allowing higher abstraction.

I tried running the files through dos2unix but that hasn't helped.
Anyone have any other ideas ? I'd like this to go away. The plugin update
isn't getting announced on a user's plugin page and the update isn't showing
up in the 2.5 dashboard.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Shortcodes and formatting
Message-ID: <47F10547.5090309@xavisys.com>

I've moved on to 2.5, and I'm quite happy with a lot of the new stuff 
that's going on with the plugin API, especially shortcodes.  HOWEVER, it 
seems that if I replace a shortcode with something (like a form for 
instance), WP is trying to format it, inserting a bunch of tags where 
they DO NOT BELONG.  Is there a way to run these shortcodes 
post-formatting?  I want to use shortcodes to add a google Map with a 
small form under it.  Here is how it should look:

<div id='map_{$this->mapNum}' style='width:{$mapInfo->width}; 
height:{$mapInfo->height};'></div>
<form action="" onsubmit="return wpGMaps.getDirections(this);">
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Get Directions:</legend>
        <label for="saddr_{$this->mapNum}">Start address:</label>
        <input type="text" name="saddr" id="saddr_{$this->mapNum}" 
value="" /><br />
        <input value="Get Directions" type="submit" />
        <input type="hidden" name="mapNum" value="{$this->mapNum}" />
        <input type="hidden" name="daddr" id="daddr_{$this->mapNum}" 
value="{$mapInfo->name}@{$mapInfo->address}" />
    </fieldset>
</form>
<div id='dir_{$this->mapNum}'></div>

but I get:
<div id='map_1' style='width:100%; height:400;'></div>
<form action="" onsubmit="return wpGMaps.getDirections(this);">
    <fieldset><br />
        <legend>Get Directions:</legend><br />
        <label for="saddr_1">Start address:</label></p>

<input type="text" name="saddr" id="saddr_1" value="" /></p>
<input value="Get Directions" type="submit" />
<input type="hidden" name="mapNum" value="1" />
<input type="hidden" name="daddr" id="daddr_1" value="Aero Rental - 
Phoenix@3432 W. Clarendon, 85017" />
    </fieldset><br />
</form>
<div id='dir_1'></div>

As you can see, it added a bunch of closing paragraph tags (with no 
opening tags to match), as well as a bunch of <br /> tags that I don't want.

Please see http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6444, which moves  
shortcodes to "11" (post-formatting).  I'd appreciate it if you could  
apply that patch and see how your Google maps HTML fares.

Without suggesting that this is a good idea or not, another issue you  
are going to run into is DBs that use auto_increment style fields  
versus others that use sequences.  This makes how you get unique IDs  
when doing an insert a challenge.  Not impossible to over come, just  
something to be aware of.

Looks like this is already in trunk!  I added my comments on the ticket 
(as well as another diff), but I'll put them here for anyone who cares:

I actually support a slightly different solution. I think that there are 
cases where post-wpautop() is great (most of the time for me), but I can 
see that there are times where you would want pre-wpautop() (especially 
for the less-advanced users). We should be able to do both. I'm 
attaching a patch that will allow people to use shortcodes as they 
worked before this ticket (pre-wpautop), or they can use them 
post-wpautop by passing a 3rd argument to add_shortcode like:

add_shortcode('googleMap', array($wpGoogleMaps, 'testTags'), true);

For me personally, the default should be the latter (priority 11), but I 
thought this would have as little impact on people currently developing 
for 2.5. However, if you think the default should change, I can upload 
another diff.

The only thing I don't like about plugins that use shortcodes is that
if you disable the plugin, you're left with a bunch of markup that no
longer renders.   While not as user friendly, it would be nice if
Wordpress supported shortcodes in HTML comment sections, i.e.

<!-- flickr: <someid> -->

or something like that.  That way when the plugin was disabled the
user wouldn't see anything.

Duane - I couldn't agree with you more. I've never tried to put [] codes 
inside HTML comments in my post before... I would assume that anything 
the plugin replaced inside the brackets would be commented about by default.

Your plugin still calls itself version 1.0: http://svn.wp-plugins.org/post-information/tags/1.2/post-information.php

The problem is that there are multiple files in your plugin that have  
a WordPress Plugin Header, so the plugin directory has to guess which  
one is the main plugin.  I've fixed the problem by making that  
guessing algorithm a bit smarter.

Thanks for letting us know about the bug.

Thanks for correcting this - I didn't realize I had more than one header
formatted as a plugin header. I don't recall there being any other source
code headers that have keywords that the page code would be looking for
other than phpdoc headers.  The structure and headers used for the plugin
have been in-place for well over a year now and didn't have this issue until
recently. but I haven't committed to the trunk in a couple of months.

 

In any event, I'm glad you were able to smarten up the algorithm. My
download numbers have jump tremendously .. probably because the plugin page
on user sites now informs them of the update.

No problem.

FYI:

Message-ID: <54f3c9690803311404v5bf8aecbk5ea43bc34143df9b@mail.gmail.com>

Hey, guys, I have what are currently two separate proposals that I would
like some individual feedback on.  Additionally, the two proposals seem like
they would go very well together, at least the way I envision them, and I am
wondering what you guys think about combining them (with consideration to
desired functionality as well as the amount of time required to implement)
into one project.  Anyway, here they are in rough form, and thanks in
advance for the feedback.

== Mass Editing of Attributes ==

Abstract:

I propose adding functionality to edit the attributes of posts, pages, and
links in batches. These attributes will include categories, tags, and author
for posts, author and parent for pages, and categories for links. If deemed
practical, functionality will be added to edit other attributes as well. The
system should be intuitive and tightly integrated into the existing user
interface.

Problem Statement:

The current WordPress system for editing attributes of various items
requires one to edit each item individually. For small numbers of items,
this is quite alright; however, the system does not scale well. It would be
very useful to have a system for batch editing.

Solution:

The system should be tightly integrated into the existing UI, meaning that
the current pages to manage posts, pages, and links will be augmented,
rather than creating a separate location for editing. Much in the way the
mass deletion feature is implemented, the system of check-boxes would be
used to select which items to edit. Additional boxes would be placed at the
bottom of the screen, similar to the way they are placed in the singular
editing page, to control the attributes such as tags and categories. By
default, of course, these boxes would be set to have no effect, but changes
could be selectively activated and effected. This would allow users to edit
different attributes, such as tags and categories, at the same time, or
simply select one type of attribute to edit, or leave the attributes
unchanged altogether.

== In-Line Reordering of Pages ==

Abstract:

I propose a means to reorder pages within the native page management system.
It will use a simple arrow-based movement system, rather than drag-and-drop.
It will support AJAX as the primary means for updating the database, and
degrade to link calls if AJAX is unavailable.

Problem Statement:

Currently there is no easy means to reorder pages in the core WordPress
system. There are various plug-ins that make an attempt at implementing this
functionality, as well as the core patch that was generated during last
year's GSoC. Each of these solutions uses a separate page to do the
reordering. This involves more clutter in the UI. Additionally, the patch
from last year never made it into core.

Solution:

I believe that augmenting the existing page management screen with
reordering functionality is preferable to adding an extra page. It will
allow for a less cluttered UI (two small buttons per row vs. an entirely new
page). Using a simple button-based system, rather than drag-and-drop, will
allow the functionality to be integrated into the existing page. It will
also allow for more graceful degradation and most likely considerably less
Javascript overhead. If the client's system does not support AJAX, the
buttons will simply be links that send the same data to the server as the
AJAX call and the same action will occur. AJAX will simply be used to
prevent re-loading extraneous data, as is its main purpose. The button-based
system does have one limitation that could be viewed as a short-coming. This
is that pages can only be reordered relative to other pages with the same
parent, rather than being moved to a different parent group as with
drag-and-drop solutions. I feel that this is not a short-coming so much as
it is desired functionality. This would be especially desired if a batch
attribute-editing feature were implemented so that page parents could be
changed easily as well. The two systems would work hand-in-hand, really.

This is definitely an important issue, and I like your approach (after a
quick look). Too sad I'm not in charge. ;)

Do the shortcodes run when the page is _rendered_ or as it's _saved_?   
If it makes the change to the saved page, then this is a moot issue.

Out of hundreds of downloads in the last few days of the latest version of
my Similar Posts plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/similar-posts/)
I have maybe five reports of a strange fatal error that interrupts plugin
activation.

The error message is like:

Fatal error: Cannot redeclare similar_posts() (previously declared in
/blah/blah/blog/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/similar-posts/similar-posts.php
:33) in
/blah/blah/blog/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/similar-posts/similar-posts.php
on line 33

Has anyone seen anything like this before? I can't see anything obviously in
common between the reporters either  -- both WP 2.3.3 and 2.5 seem to be
affected so I'm guessing I've made a mistake somewhere.

That happens when you try to activate an allready active plugin..
It can also happen when the activation suceeds, yet the plugin has  
outputted some content on the activtion call, or issued a die(), and it  
redirects back to the fatal error page.. At which point the plugin is  
actually active.

Changing the include()'s to include_once() in activate_plugins might  
resolve that issue.. But would make some people rather confused when it  
claims not to have activated, yet its activated.

Actually, back during winter I was thinking an integrated gallery would be a
good project, but then I saw that 2.5 already had it.  I may take a look at
the gallery functionality a bit more over the next week (since the deadline
got pushed back) and if I have any good ideas maybe I'll draw up another
proposal.

But that's not what this topic was about, so ... anything on topic about my
two proposals, guys?  Sorry to ruin your fun, Matt.  ;)
