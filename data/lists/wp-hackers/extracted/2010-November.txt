Did you try Yoast's new SEO plugin <http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/> ?

I don't really use any SEO plugin, as I like to do all the SEO directly from
the theme.

Hi there,

I've created plugins called Paid Link Manager[1]. Currently, it uses custom
tables to store it's data. However, I want to minimize the use of it. I've
looked ad wp_links and I don't see any column where I can hook my group id
to it.

Therefore, is there any plan to add wp_links_meta table to future wordpress
release?

No.

We are more likely to remove the links table and move the data elsewhere that do that.

There's no comparison chart yet, though I've got one in the pipeline for
when I release my WordPress SEO plugin. Most of these plugins have somewhat
similar functionality for titles and descriptions, but the rest of the
functionality makes all the difference.

So, do you suggest me to stick with my current choice (using my own custom

Hi Arief:

As Peter says, don't use the wp_links table, it will probably be deprecated in a future version of WordPress.  Instead seriously consider creating a custom post type for your links.  It may seem like overkill at first but over time you are likely to appreciate all the functionality you'll get "for free" with a custom post type.

Here's a link to a presentation I gave about Custom Post Types to the Atlanta WordPress developer's meetup group recently.  While the examples are not directly related to a list of links, there are lots of relevant links to other articles about custom post types which should be helpful.

 http://bit.ly/atlwp-cpt-oct-2010

Hope this helps.

-Mike

Damn it, why I never though of using wordpress custom post type for this.

Message-ID: <4CCEAB49.8040801@rotorised.com>

As much as I love Subversion, GitHub is (IMHO) a much better tool for
rapid development. In order to link the WP.org Plugins section with
GitHub, I was planning to use SVN externals to set the trunk of the
plugin to GitHub's SVN interface. By doing this, the trunk directory
would be an external rather than an actual directory.

Has anyone tried this before, and if so, have you encountered any
problems? If not, can anyone forsee any problems with this before I try?
(If so, I'd be willing to try and fix the code. :) )

It doesn't work, in the sense that the zip file generated for download will

I haven't tried that but, after significant trial and error, I found a reliable way to easily update WP.org from a GitHub repo:

Small semantic point: your first sentence doesn't really parse.
Subversion is a SCM, while GitHub is a Git-powered collaborative
development/code hosting site. A closer analog would be perhaps
SourceForge.net's SVN hosting capabilities.

SVN:Git:Mercurial::SF.net's SVN hosting:GitHub:Bitbucket

Just so no one ends up confused.

Indeed - Externals are explicitly not included in zips.

I believe with git-svn you can do this and push the changes to svn as and when you want though.

I'd be interested in knowing this too, as I'll be implementing a new
UI API within Pods 2.0 which will give make a bit of UI customization
quite a bit easier for devs. I haven't looked in the code yet at this,
but will be following this topic.

Seems fairly complicated, and a quite common issue among plugin developers.
Perhaps a thorough tutorial should be included in the Plugin Dev Handbook
;-)

Custom taxonomies do not have any support for default terms.

Categories don't have any support to remove default terms.

I would not mind code in core that abstracts both.

I am not able to reproduce this problem using WP 3.1-alpha, either regular
or multisite. So, it was either fixed since WP 3.0.1 or it's caused by a
plugin or theme.

Is there a such thing as a Custom Post Type Unit-Test Plugin for Testers? If
not, maybe we need one. It'd allow beta testers to also test a standardized
implementation of core functionality that isn't visible with just the
default install with 2010 Theme.

Perhaps a conical plugin that implements just a generic Custom Post Type and
utilizes all the built-in functionality offered by core, and included in the
Alpha and Beta releases, but not the finals. As an added bonus, it'd also
act as a boiler-plate for plugin devs for best practice...

Any support for this idea?

Ooh, we need one of those!  I've been thinking about the same need recently.

Actually I need unit-testing for a lot more than just that.

It just occurred to me (and I don't know if it'd be proper) but
perhaps Peter Westwood's "WordPress Beta Tester" could be expanded (if
he'd be so inclined) to include unit-tests, though I rather think that
a full collection of conical plugins would likely be more appropriate.

The unit tests would have to rely on being very current with core to
truly be useful as a testing suite. I think the payoff in rapid
response would be worth it though.

And I'm with Mike, I think that this applies to more then just Custom
Post Types. (It's just that Custom Post Types are currently throwing
errors on the nightly, and it's hard to confirm it's not just my poor
plugin's fault ;-)

Thanks Nacin!

Perhaps I should've said, "Reference Test" as apposed to "Unit Test"
as that describes what I was really looking for. I'm still quite the
noob; that stuff's a bit intimidating... Looks like fun to try and get
my head around it though, so this weekend I shall try and learn what
all that code does :-)

(got any tutorials handy on that?)

I do something similar in my pastebin plugin. I save the default term as
a plugin option and basically do something like 

add_action( 'wp_insert_post', 'update_post_terms' );

function update_post_terms( $post_id ) {
    if ( $parent = wp_is_post_revision( $post_id ) )
        $post_id = $parent;
    $post = get_post( $post_id );
    if ( $post->post_type != 'post' )
        return;

	// add a tag
    wp_set_post_terms( $post_id, 'new tag', 'post_tag', true );

	// add a category
    $categories = wp_get_post_categories( $post_id );
    $newcat    = get_term_by( 'name', 'Some Category', 'category' );
    array_push( $categories, $newcat->term_id );
    wp_set_post_categories( $post_id, $categories );
}

Subject: [wp-hackers] do_favicon equivalent to do_robotstxt?
Message-ID: <AANLkTimv2_TLXecQo3inhpKGg54HaE_X0_nivGApa8SF@mail.gmail.com>

I was attempting an "apple-touch-icon" and favicon functionality for a
theme, but evidently, "apple-touch-icon" needs to reside at root; The
meta tag in head doesn't work. (Also, there was a discussion on
[theme-reviewers] Themes and Favicons.) This is problematic because as
far as I know, plugins and themes can't/shouldn't be writing there.

Then I came across the do_robotstxt and it occured to me that a
version for favicons or sitemaps or anything else would be rather
useful for those cases, as then when a plugin or theme is no longer
active, there effects would disappear. From what I gather,
do_robotstxt simulates the file rather then creating a real file in
root.

Should something like do_robotstxt for favicons/sitemaps/etc be
implemented in core for general convienence or is this still something
belonging to plugins/themes and that plugin/theme devs should work out
for themselves?

So basically, something along the lines of a parameter to register_taxonomy of support_default_term have false to disable and a string to define the default term. Then strip out the code that creates the default category and then put support_default_term as Uncategorized. But then add logic so that it will recognize if it was changed.

<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/images/ios.png" /> has worked fine for
me in the past.

That said, I don't know if this is something for core, necessarily -- this
sounds like something that could be latched onto at template_redirect
provided a rewrite rule offers a query variable.

Favicon requests are actually killed really early in the process, that way
we're not unnecessarily loading WordPress twice. (See wp_favicon_request()).

Indeed very welcome.

Hello,

on my plugin's entry at

a link to my WordPress profile at
http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/Alois+Maenner/

My WordPress.org account name is "Alois Maenner", so the link seems to
be semantically correct.

Nevertheless, the profile page is empty, and I cannot edit my profile
information either. My profile at profiles.wordpress.org is to be
found at
http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/Alois%20Maenner/, an equally blank page.

Has someone successfully registered a WordPress profile with a user
name containing anything but letters and numbers yet?

Regards,

Alois

Use the auto-draft post status, a useful feature from 3.0.

Just hook to wp_insert_post and if $post->post_status is 'auto-draft', 
assign the default terms via wp_set_object_terms. This way you will add 
them only once (when a new post is created, literally), so you can 
modify them later, and have as many default terms for posts as you want.

If you don't want to hardcode the default terms (which would be a wise 
option), just use options and a settings page.

Message-ID: <4CCFCD8D.1090608@gmail.com>

I have attached a patch which fixes several small validation errors when
rendering pages in wp-admin. I have not yet gone through all pages yet.
There will be a few more fixes to follow to get all the current core
trunk admin pages to render without validation errors.

I have also created a ticket for this on WordPress' Trac:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15287

Perhaps someone else who's run into these issues will find it helpful.

Subject: [wp-hackers] What were the shared hosting issues with persistent
 file cache prior to WP 2.5 ?
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=Q6wk=hpd7gemCMrq5W27noK8tW_ZhwaRqF0+r@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am doing some research on file-based caching and I read that persistent
cache was removed from WP since 2.5 and was replaced with in-memory one. The
reason for that were that the WP implementation was hardly introducing any
performance boost and that there were some issues with shared hosting.

Does someone recall what these issues were, or at least where I can read
about them ?

I've checked the links from here:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Cache#Persistent_Caching

and it seems that all file-based cache solutions (even W3 has one in the
W3_Cache_File class) create a separate file for each cached entry. Was this
the issue that lead to performance degradation ?

Thanks in advance,
K.

The profiles thing doesn't like some usernames. It's on the TODO list.

Shared hosted storing the filesystem on remote NFS share

This is slower to access than the mysql db

What Peter said. A large number of hosts use shared filesystems
(especially "cloud" hosts) and accessing the filesystem over the
network (be it via NFS or any other means) is slow.

Also, even local filesystem access frequently isn't really any faster
than database access in many cases. For example, if you're running a
database server on the same machine, then the SQL query cache probably
is storing a lot of the results of your common queries in RAM. Much
faster to get them from there than to go load a file. Filesystem
caching generally isn't very aggressive and so hits to that cache
often miss, requiring it to go back to the disk.

Like all things, it depends on the specific details of your setup.
This is why it's best left to plugins to allow you to optimize as
needed for your particular circumstances. If you have a big site, best
way to do it is to use some kind of distributed memory caching, like
memcached, for caching persistent objects.

Mladen,

It is very likely that the problem is not the host but rather the way in
which you "un-hacked" your site. Saying that you fixed it and upgraded it is
one thing, but you probably didn't finish the job. If there are leftover
base_64() scripts then you definitely didn't clean it up properly.

If an old version of WP is hacked then upgrading it won't make it secure
until you have cleaned out every single file that was there before,
preferably replacing the entire filesystem and tightening all permissions as
well. It only takes one malicious file to completely own your site again, so
you have to start completely fresh.

I recommend you start with a blank new directory on your webhost, install
the WP files from http://wordpress.org and install any plugins/themes you
need fresh from the repo. If you want to keep your old uploads folder you
should also look in every directory of it to make sure that all the files
are in fact the images you think they are, and not php/perl/python files
that can be used as a back door to your site.

If you can do an export/import of your content then that is probably also a
good idea, in case crap is hidden in the database.

Alois,

Have you had any luck with your http://buddypress.org/ profile? The
info profiles.wordpress.org is pulled from there, atleast, that's how
it works for me. The login from profiles is broken for my account, but
whatever I put in buddypress.org shows up on my profile page. I tried
to find you there, but it's 404'd at buddypress.org as well.

I believe that it is because in MultiSite WordPress, usernames with a
space are particularly problematic, unlike single installs, in which
spaces are fine. So, I believe, your best bet for using
wordpress.org/buddypress.org maybe be to change or register a new
username. (Sorry, that sucks I know)

I've been asked by a huge majority of people to make a comicpress theme compatible that wordpress.com could be able to use, and well I did it;  basically the comic itself is the 'featured image' of the comic post type.  So therefore its not using any external uploading factor or creating any new directories, its basically using the media library like everything else does, and calls the featured image as the comic;  with basic first next previous last navigation.

Who would I talk with about getting the new Easel theme with the comicpress-light addon; put on wordpress.com ?

Hello everyone,

Any idea how to achive it? I did not find any hook to change image_link_input_fields().
I found image_default_link_type option in database in WP 2.9, but I am not sure if it is the best way...

Thank you for your help...

So if you create a Custom Post Type, make a few entries, then either
change or delete the plugin/theme, a bunch of entries become orphaned
into the database with no way to delete them...

Do any of you know a good plugin that would scan and display a list of
abandoned Custom Post Types and possibly their entries? Or any slick
script to do so?

It could be useful to users in general, that entries belonging to a
deactivated Custom Post Type be listed is a default catch-all (named
"Orphan" or "Other" or whatnot).

I would guess that there would be some performance benefit if the "file
cache" is in the form of "pure php", so when you have to use that cache you
just include the file like any other php script you have included. That
combined with var_export() and using just one file for the cache (instead
one cache file per cache entry) probably is going to deliver better results.
At least there is no penalty for serialization/unserialization, and in this
way with the includes we are sort of hijacking the file-reading and
evaluation of their content by PHP itself.

I did some testing, although I am not sure how legit is that, and on an
environment like shared hosting hardly 10% of the wordpress queries are
delivered from sql cache. Out of that 10% I am not sure how much are those
queries which output is being cached.

I wrote about that above: what if all the cache entries are read/written in
bulk ? Take the current implementation for example (the mem-based): it
stores everything inside an array, so hits and misses only deal with that
array. If we save that array (with all the cached entries inside it) to file
when destroying the object (or with register_shutdown_function()), and then
include it when instantiating it, we are going to skip all the file-system
read and write operations. In the worst-case scenario there is just one
include (on an absolute path to be faster than include_path-based), and one
write to file when dumping the contents of the cache array. The rest is the
same -- the add/replace/set/get cache functions use the cache array.

Thanks, Otto. I am familiar with the available persistent cache options, but
almost all of them are hard to use in shared hosting environment. I am
looking for affordable solution to that problem. What I have in mind is
indeed file-based cache just as I explained it above, with include and
var_export(). Then I read that WP already had a file-based cache and ditched
it since 2.5 and I was curious to find out why. Thanks to your reply and
Peter's I now know what the issues were and I think that my approach can
produce somewhat promising results -- I just got to code it and test it ;)

Again, thanks for the replies.

Ken:

I didn't have time to complete it, but here's a start.  It at least lets you see the orphaned post types:  

http://gist.github.com/660437

Load it using:  

http://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?orphans=true

Next step is to let you delete and even edit them (not sure if I'll have time to get to that.)

Thanks Mike! Exactly what I was looking for! Works great for my needs
so far. Could be a useful plugin at the end of the day... Cheers!

I bet there are enough people wanting to know how to get it up and running
that just posting it in this thread would be great.

Won't work either.

It looks like user names that were imported into BuddyPress profiles
from forum accounts (where they had to adhere to less strict naming
conventions) have a chance of breaking BuddyPress assumptions about
valid profile names.

This apparently leads to 404s all over the WordPress ecosystem.

You could go with the wrapper class method. Instead of loading a CSS
file conditionally based on which option is chosen, change the widget
class name based on which option is chosen. Then you can define all
the different styles in one CSS file which is always loaded. Eg:

When option 1 is chosen the widget gets a class name of my_widget_layout_1:

<div class="my_widget_layout_1">
<p>Foo bar</p>
</div>

When option 2 is chosen the widget gets a class name of my_widget_layout_2:

<div class="my_widget_layout_2">
<p>Foo bar</p>
</div>

These will be styled thus in your CSS file:

.my_widget_layout_1 {
color: red;
}

.my_widget_layout_2 {
color:blue;
}

Hope this helps.

John

Hi,

I've put my preposition for a new file-based cache in a trac ticket, please
review and comment -- I'd like to hear what you think about it:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15304

The solution that I am proposing lacks the extensive file-system reads and
writes, it hijacks on PHP's own functionality and unlike the mem-based
solution currently in WP it is persistent.

Cheers,

Probably should be a plugin. The object cache was made pluggable for
just that purpose.

Rather than having different stylesheet, why not have a single 
stylesheet with different each style represented by a specific class? 
Then all you have to do is output the class for the selected style in 
the main widget wrapper div or one that is inside the main widget wrapper.

The stylesheet could contain the following:

.blue p { color: #00F; }
.red p { color: #F00; }
...

Then the widget HTML could look like the following:

<?php echo $before_widget; ?>
<div class="<?php echo $widget['style']; ?>">
<?php if ( ! empty( $widget['title'] ) ) echo $before_title . 
$widget['title'] . $after_title; ?>
...

It seems that John had the same idea before me. Interestingly, we also 
both chose to use blue and red colors as examples. It makes it look like 
I stole the idea. :(

Dang broken threads.

Subject: [wp-hackers] OpenBook -- update not appearing on plugin page
Message-ID: <4CD2C08A.40302@gmail.com>

Hi, been developing the OpenBook plugin for a couple years, but new to 
the list.

Yesterday I updated OpenBook via SVN with a major new version (3.1) but 
a day later I don't see the update on the plugin page (still at 2.1.8). 
I've done this many times before, but not for a few months and the 
update usually comes reasonably quickly -- a few minutes.

Are plugin updates slower now?
Is there somewhere else to consult on this?

There is currently and issue with the update process that we are looking into.

It will be fixed once we have tracked it down

Subject: [wp-hackers] register_theme_directory issue or ???
Message-ID: <4CD2EC4B.9050401@elfden.co.uk>

I'm trying to test the development version of the bbPress plugin 
locally and am unable to because activating the child theme is 
producing some interesting and invalid results:

get_theme_roots() produces this:
Array
(
[bbp-twentyten] => 
E:\htdocs\wpcurrent\wp-content\plugins\bbpress//bbp-themes
[twentyten] => /themes
)

get_stylesheet() produces this:
bbp-twentyten

but get_theme_root( get_stylesheet() ) produces this:
E:\htdocs\wpcurrent/wp-contentE:\htdocs\wpcurrent\wp-content\plugins\bbpress//bbp-themes 


and bloginfo( 'stylesheet_url' ) produces this:
http://127.0.0.1/wpcurrent/wp-content/E:\htdocs\wpcurrent\wp-content\plugins\bbpress//bbp-themes/bbp-twentyten/style.css


The plugin adds a location for child theme directory via 
register_theme_directory:
E:\htdocs\wpcurrent\wp-content\plugins\bbpress/bbp-themes/
and appears to be registered correctly(but what do I know?) - and it 
does work on my web host, just not locally!

Local server is EasyPHP:
PHP 5.3.2
apache 2.2.15
MySQL 5.1.45
running on Windows 7

So question 1:
anyone know of another plugin that has a child theme in it that I 
could test?

question 2:
Now is this a windows path issue, me being brain dead, or something 
else entirely?

Pretty sure BuddyPress uses register_theme_directory() it was introduced for it :-)

Possibly a path issue - how do the paths compare to what you get on the server?

It does, but it isn't a child theme, so wasn't any use.

Hmm just tested the path, never thought to do this before and windows 
won't show it because of the double //

And I've figured out where that is being inserted, off to Trac now.


I should be able to fix from there, thanks!

A bit off-topic for WP Hackers, don't you think? :)

The best place to suggest new themes for WordPress.com is on the themes forum:
http://en.forums.wordpress.com/forum/themes

If you receive lots of requests for it you can encourage folks to post
there also and vote it up. The most useful votes are those with a note
about why they like the theme and would love to see it on
WordPress.com.

Ever get the feeling that avenues of communication with WordPress is lacking 
direction, hence why I asked on wp-hackers because I know there are people 
on here who can guide and direct.

After all, thats the progression that everyone says is the backbone to 
documentation and processes, to teach and learn; hence I asked in the area 
which I know might get a response, while other areas I know will not 
solicite that response.  Regardless, thanks for replying.

Not at all. Your own answer to Philip's question goes to show that in
fact it was a great place to ask this question.

I am going to be working on a board of directors website that will need limited access based on which committees they are a member.  I have looked at both members plugin and wish list member.  I was just wondering if there are any other options out there that I have missed.  I don't have any problem paying for software, and but not especially like encrypted software such as wishlist member, and have no way of knowing if it will work with custom post types etc.  Any recomendations other than just digging into roles and capabilities and rolling my own?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Status of mu-plugins
Message-ID: <4CD3F79B.6080903@gmail.com>

Hi,

Since the merge with WordPress Mu seems to be finished I was wondering 
if the mu-plugins directory will stay part of the future of WordPress?

I'm asking since I'm planning to rewrite a plugin to make use of 
mu-plugin directory (automatically activated for a multisite) since the 
plugin is only useful for a complete multisite installation.

Thanks!

The Multi-User plugins are now called Must-Use plugins (great use of a
backronym). If you install a mu-plugin in WordPress 3.0 you'll see it
under the Must-Use tab on the Plugins menu. From that, I highly doubt
they will be removed as they serve the same purpose for Multisite as
they did for WPMU.

If someone needs multiple sidebars (or footers) in a single template,
it's no problem. Just give the function a $name. But when i look at
the avaible hooks like wp_meta() & wp_footer() from wp core, then i
see no sollution for a similar behavior (/core-root/wp-includes/
general-template.php).

Have i overseen something or can i (currently) only give the
wp_standard hooks to one sidebar? Or did i simply miss the point
somewhere?

And they are neat even if you aren't using multi-site

No chance that mu-plugins support is going to be removed.

WOOT for a 100% on-topic question for the list..

 > The Multi-User plugins are now called Must-Use plugins
 > (great use of a backronym).

Oh that is is hilarious... My mind hadn't taken that final leap and 
re-translated MU to Must Use.

To stray just a little but further the conversation... The way I use the 
mu-plugins directory with most plugins is to have mini-plugin there that 
is really just a list of includes and forced options for the plugins.

For example I will place the tweetmeme directory in mu-plugins an 
activate it on all the mu blogs with this section in an 
activate_mu_plugins.php file:

// Load tweetmeme and force the non-default options.
include( 'tweetmeme/tweetmeme.php' );
function _ehi_tm_where( $base ) {
     return 'manual';
}
add_filter( 'pre_option_tm_where', '_ehi_tm_where' );

That activates it and sets the options that I want.  my-hacks.php used 
to serve this purpose, but now there's no need for a separate file.

Message-ID: <2CECDA63-1249-4824-B49E-55DB9D43161B@ur.ua.edu>

Hi all,

I have a plugin that restricts the categories users can view/edit in the admin.  All works fine in WordPress 3.0.1, but as I started testing 3.1 I noticed that the category filter, which is AJAX, allows you to bypass the restrictions.  I'm able to filter this out in 3.0.1 because it's submitted via URL parameters.  My trouble is being able to $_GET the 'cat' parameter from the new AJAX request.

I'm no jQuery expert, so if someone has any ideas on how I can do this I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Matthew Muro

Thanks for your answer Rafael,

I'm aware, that you register widget_areas "instead" of sidebars.

My extended Questions @the core dev team:
* Will wp_meta/wp_footer get extended with something like
wp_meta_{$name}/wp_footer_{$name}?
* Or: Will both get deprecated in favor of widget areas?

* (Thought loud) If none of both: What sense does it make to (still)
place them in themes? And should plugin developers move away from
attaching "stuff" to those template hooks and make widgets instead?

Sorry if those Questions are inappropriate or even "wrong". WordPress
is pretty huge right now and gives me a lot of areas where i can
invest a lot of "brain" ... Thank you.

If you install Firebug, you will find that the 'cat' parameter is passed to
the AJAX request too.

If you need more help, share the link to the plugin.

These hooks are meant to transcend template files:

function my_particular_callback() {
  if ( // some condition is meat ) {
    // do stuff
  }
}
add_action('wp_footer', 'my_particular_callback');

The default WP behavior of inserting a link to the image is a scourge upon
the face of the internet. On all kinds of different sites I click on images
that are links only to be taken to the exact same small image, a flat out
error made by many/most WP bloggers because of the default settings and lack
of an option to change them.

I think the installed-default should be no link unless the user pushes one
of the link buttons to paste one in. There should also be a setting in media
options to change the default.

I have used the 'image_default_link_type' option on 2.9 and setting it to
empty has the right effect of making the default link nothing (though it can
take some refreshing before it works that way i think because of js
caching). You can access it from /wp-admin/options.php (hidden list of all
options) to avoid editing the database directly.

The plugin is Restrict Categories:  http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/restrict-categories/

I have Firebug installed and can see the 'cat' parameter, but what is the PHP/jQuery I need to use to retrieve the value?

By the way, I have not committed the fix for 3.0.1 yet and can send that separately if you really want it.

Thanks,

Hi all,

I have a plugin that restricts the categories users can view/edit in the
admin.  All works fine in WordPress 3.0.1, but as I started testing 3.1 I
noticed that the category filter, which is AJAX, allows you to bypass the
restrictions.  I'm able to filter this out in 3.0.1 because it's submitted
via URL parameters.  My trouble is being able to $_GET the 'cat' parameter
from the new AJAX request.

I'm no jQuery expert, so if someone has any ideas on how I can do this I'd
appreciate it.


If you install Firebug, you will find that the 'cat' parameter is passed to
the AJAX request too.

If you need more help, share the link to the plugin.

Thanks for the answer. "Transcend template files" explains the
intended usecase of these hooks very well. I just thought that
wp_meta() is some "old and good therefore leave it where it is" stuff.
The description of wp_meta(): "Example plugin use: include a rotating
advertisement or a tag cloud." over here [1] was a little
missleading..

Btw: Your article is a pretty good reference.

Well, to be honest, I've never even heard about wp_meta() until now.

I think it will be deprecated, as it's use seems quite limited, compared to
widgets, which were probably added after wp_meta().

Message-ID: <B23687B2-BF43-4A81-BC11-DE3CEB4C834D@gmail.com>

We're currently using categories in permalinks, but we'd like a way to  
order which categories appear, instead of the default WordPress  
handling which is based on ID number.

So, for example, right now the 'news' category is ID 1, and the  
'politics' category is ID 5. However, if there's a story that's  
categorized both news and politics we'd rather the have the permalink  
contain right /politics/ than /news/. In addition, if politics were to  
be a subcategory we'd rather it was /politics/ instead of /news/ 
politics/.

I've taken a look at http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Rewrite 
  and but haven't had a ton of success.

Thanks!

In all seriousness though, we should make a clear guideline for what is and
isn't offtopic for wp-hackers.

Currently, it's something like this:

Is there an easy way to query for any posts that is tagged with any term
from a particular taxonomy?

I know this technique:

$custom_taxonomy_query = new WP_Query(
array(
 'taxonomy_name' => 'term_slug',
 )
);

But I would like to either pass a wildcard in place of term_slug, or perhaps
just an empty string. Then that would give me all posts that are tagged by
any term in that taxonomy, not just one specific term.

Thanks for your help,

You could call get_terms to get the terms, then run the query for all
those terms.

You might need 3.1 to do this multiple-term query thing. Dunno.

I think you're right, I am unable to pass anything other than a string to
the taxonomy piece of WP_Query in 3.0.1

We're actually not starting the permalink with the category (the full  
structure is /2010/10/25/politics/lepages-cleared-in-florida-tax- 
case/). I saw this post a long time ago and kept that in mind.

With the date in there, is it still considered harmful? My boss was  
pretty adamant about getting the category in there (it's a feature of  
the old CMS that we use quite a bit).

No. It's only when the first %whatever% bit is a non-numeric field
that it's harmful.

Awesome, just checking.

So, back to the original question, which is exactly what hook do I use  
to modify the category order? Would that be post_rewrite_rules?

No. WordPress doesn't actually *use* the category in the permalink to
retrieve posts, so you'd just need to modify the output of the
get_permalink function. You could do this using the post_link filter,
but you'd have to copy all the functionality of the get_permalink
function to do it.

That will only half work, I think. WordPress will redirect you to what  
it defines as the correct url. So you can link someone to http://new.bangordailynews.com/2010/10/25/business/lepages-cleared-in-florida-tax-case/ 
  (even if it isn't in the business category, which is nice), but it  
will redirect you to http://new.bangordailynews.com/2010/10/25/politics/lepages-cleared-in-florida-tax-case/ 
.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Blackbird Pie: Twitter API functionality in Core?
Message-ID: <45C9F773-C9EB-4850-81B0-3BABDDFC82E6@newclarity.net>

Hi all,

Seeing the announcement of Blackbird Pie[1] makes me wonder if there will a near-term inclusion of low-level Twitter API functionality into WordPress core, or is this just a plugin feature to be used only on WordPress.com?

I'm especially interested in this because my team is right now building a class to interface with the Twitter API to enable flexibility that is not in any of the plugins that I've seen (they all seem to implement functionality for the end-user, they don't really provide API functionality for the developer.) 

If such an API will be included with WordPress core I'd like to use it rather than duplicate its functionality. Basically what I want to know is: 1.) if it will be added to core, 2.) when it will be added to core, 3.) when I can get a look at the code and 4.) who I need to contact for that (Justin Shreve?)

Thanks in advance.

-Mike

There is already a .org plugin similar to the .com feature.

I wouldn't expect it to be, given that Twitter is a proprietary platform.

What WordPress defines as the "correct" url is determined by the
results of get_permalink(). If you modify that, as I suggested, then
you are redefining what the correct URL actually is.

I don't see this as core material either. I would not be surprised if it
gets a proper release as a plugin on wordpress.org. That said, the plugin is
probably quite trivial, to be honest, so it should be easy to re-create for
your specific needs. It's just a custom embed handler. I've pitched this
exact idea in a recent WordCamp talk on advanced APIs [1].

According to the code in canonical.php that checks if the categories in the
URL are actually assigned to the post, they only need to be assigned to the
post to prevent a redirect, versus being what get_permalink() generates. So
if the post is actually in /business/, it shouldn't redirect to /politics/
even if WP thinks the permalink is /politics/.

This is also just the code as it exists currently in trunk, at least. This
may get more specific in the future.

What you need to do here is actually redefine what WordPress thinks is the
correct URL. This is not easily filterable in get_permalink(), but it is
doable. You'll note that in get_permalink(), we specifically order
categories by ID before choosing one. Obviously you want to handle the
ordering on your own and probably kill off category parent listing.

If someone can come up with a good way to filter the various moving gears
there, patches are welcome.

Thanks Mike! That worked. The only catch is that sticky posts sneak in there
regardless of their taxonomy terms.

Well they are "sticky", right?  :)

It's weird behavior, I think, but if you use "caller_get_posts=1" and they should go away:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_posts#Sticky_Post_Parameters

Hope this helps.

-Mike

P.S. Still trying to figure out where they got the name "caller_get_posts=1" (i.e. why not "sticky_posts=0?"), but it is what it is.

Thanks.  Did I read that right, that "caller_get_posts" has been renamed?  Looking at the 3.0.1 code I still see "caller_get_posts."

Yes, it's been renamed to 'ignore_sticky_posts', but in 3.1-alpha.

Good idea, but will it handle backward compatibility?

Like you I do the vast majority of my SEO at theme level, you can't
SEO a WordPress blog without getting under the bonnet of the theme you
are using, I'd say 90% plus of SEO can be achieved at theme level and
very little at plugin level (plugins add fluff).

I make my living as an SEO consultant and have looked at most of the
so called SEO plugins and they are rubbish, I use none of them, what
is it with them still concentrating on meta tags in 2010!

Anyway, had a look at the plugin above and it doesn't add anything
truely worthwhile. It's not an SEO plugin IMO.

When it comes to WordPress the current major issue is with all the
nofollow links WordPress generates, you can easily waste over half
your link benefit just through nofollow links!! Through a use of theme
editing, editing a core WordPress file (fortunatly just one), one
plugin (not an SEO plugin) and removing full HTML links from the body
of comments (the only manual input from me) I've managed to remove all
nofollow links from my WordPress sites. Note: a well commented site
can have hundreds if not thousands of nofollow links, I have a popular
jokes site with almost 18,000 comments that if I used default
WordPress with a standard theme would have at least 18,000 nofollow
links!!!!

If any of the WordPress development team read this PLEASE try to
remove the nofollow links from WordPress, they are really damaging
your users SEO efforts!

I've tried to get a paticular issue fixed (very easy to fix BTW, takes
me two minutes to add the fix to new versions of WordPress before I
upgrade) regarding nofollow and the Reply to comment links, (one of
these nofollow links added to every comment if you turn threaded
comments on) but so far no joy!

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10550
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/287704?replies=1
http://codex.wordpress.org/Talk:Template_Tags/comment_reply_link

This is a massive SEO issue with WordPress, if you want to understand
the problem and see some partial solutions see
http://www.google-adsense-templates.co.uk/wp-content/themes/talian-adsense-clickbank-seo-05/readme/08-nofollow-problems.txt

Would be great for WordPress to take this nofollow issue seriously and
come up with another way to link out to sites without passing link
benefit or using a nofollow attribute (whilst having the option to
link out with passing SEO benefit as well).

In the theme I use I converted author links to form buttons which
Google etc... don't treat as links (don't pass any SEO value), but
browsers treat just like links (so you can still give your commenters
links without damaging your sites SEO). Since I don't want to waste
link benefit on the login links changed those to form button links as
well. Got hundreds of customers running this code and so far no issues
reported.

All works fine in WordPress 3.0.1, but as I started testing 3.1 I noticed that the category filter, which is AJAX, allows you to bypass the restrictions.  I'm able to filter this out in 3.0.1 because it's submitted via URL parameters.  My trouble is being able to $_GET the 'cat' parameter from the new AJAX request.

That's great, after the next update will no longer have to explain to
theme customers how to edit that core file :-)

Any thoughts on a WordPress core solution for the other nofollow links
generated from comments?

It's not an issue for me any longer since I've coded my theme to
replace links with forms with this format:

<form method="post"
action="http://www.domain.com/wp-login.php"><div><button
class="loglinks">Login</button></div></form>

and

<form class="formlink" method="post"
action="http://www.domain.com"><div><button class="bnofollow"
title="Author Name">Author Name</button></div></form>

And use css to style the button to look like a text links. The first
is what I use for login links and the second for author links.

This works for login links and author links, about the only problem
with it is you can't right click and open in new window for this type
of 'link'.

I haven't figured out a way to use this code in the body of comments,
so have used this plugin http://ducedo.com/remove-links-in-comments/
which results in links lacking HTML formatting in comments from
WordPress adding HTML formatting to them (so nofollow is never added
as it's just body text: users have to copy the link and paste in a
browser if they want to visit a site, which is not ideal). The plugin
doesn't work on fully formed links within the body of comments, so
this sort of link

<a href="http://domain.com">Anchor Text</a>

Will gain a nofollow attribute. In this case I manually edit the
comment as those nofollow links are so damaging SEO wise.

On my main theme I have an admin menu where I can turn adding author
links and showing author links in comments on/off as well. This means
on some sites I use commenters can't add an author URL in the first
place (got a jokes site with almost 18,000 comments and so many add
silly things for the author URL) and even if an author link is added
it doesn't show anyway (that hides old author links). These would be
good features to be part of core WordPress.

Hi,

Firstly, please post to the list with a sensible From name.

Using "Adsense Templates" as your From just makes you look like a spammer :-)

You haven't provided any evidence for your claims to support your request for changes.

Where can we see documentation which shows that PR is reduced due to the nofollow on these links?

Here's an easy to follow example.

I have a WordPress page set to show 50 comment threads with comment
threading turned on of course.

Each full page of comments will have at least 50 Reply to Comments
links, that's a minimum 50 nofollow links on highly commented pages.

Every link on a page shares the PR/link benefit that's flowing through
that page, doesn't matter if it's an internal link or an external
link, they all gain a fair share of the link benefit. If overall a
page has 100 links from it, each gains 1/100th of the link benefit
flowing through that page.

This example page has another 50 links from it, combination of
internal and external links (category links, tag links, home page
links, blogroll etc...), so in total we have 100 links, 50 are
nofollow and 50 are not nofollow.

Since nofollow deletes PR/link benefit equal to one link share rather
than protects it as this attribute was initially intended to do, this
page looses half it's link benefit that could go to other pages the
page links to for no gain.

If you don't think loosing 50% of a pages link benefit for no gain
isn't an OMG issue, you don't understand the importance of link
benefit to SEO. It's the most important SEO factor that takes most
effort to achieve.

Like I said before, I have a popular jokes site with almost 18,000
user comments, this is on a site with about 1,500 posts. If I allowed
18,000+ nofollow links on a site I might as well dofollow the links
and allow link spammers free reign on the comments, at least that way
the link benefit actually benefits someone rather than deleting it!
That site is breaking through the 15,000 unique visitors a day mark
and it's home page is only PR3 (I waste no link benefit, it all works
on my sites).

The Reply to Comment links is the extreme of this problem and fixing
it is a big move forward. The nofollow links of authors links is less
damaging, but it is damaging all the same and if it can be fixed in
WordPress it should be (again doesn't hurt my sites, I've solved the
problem, it's WordPress users who are loosing Google rankings).

If 20% of your commenters add an author URL or link from the body of
comments and your blog has 500 comments, that's 100 nofollow links
that's deleting valuable link benefit.

There's monetary value to dofollow links, depending on how you sell
links it can be $10 a link per month for a PR0 page on a site with a
decent home page PR. The wasted link benefit of those 100 nofollow
links could be $1,000 a month, if they are on pages with PR they are
worth more.

Some WordPress sites will be deleting enough link benefit to run
successful online eccomerce stores!

BTW This is one of the reasons why the so called SEO plugins aren't
SEO plugins, they have options to add more nofollow links!!!

This is a fairly simple fix. In your comments.php file in your  
template, edit wp_list_comments to include a custom callback that  
doesn't include nofollow links. See: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_list_comments 
.

In the end, I think nofollow links to prevent link spamming are useful  
to most users.

Or, alternatively, use the get_comment_author_link filter to remove  
the nofollow attribute. http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/nav.html?wp-includes/comment-template.php.source.html#l138

Not helpful if you don't want to link out to anyone who can find your
site and paste a URL into a comment form or use a script to
automatically spam your site for links. I only link to sites in a way
that passes SEO benefit when I choose to link to that site.

Unfortunatly allowing dofollow links in your comments can result in
your site being added to dofollow lists which are shared amongst
comment spammers.

I'd like to see core WordPress have the ability to both allow and
block author URLs etc... in multiple ways without harming a sites SEO.

Or it would be fairly simple to write your own plugin that uses  
comment meta to decide whether or not to use nofollow or not.

You are missing the point, from an SEO perspective we don't want ANY
nofollow links as they delete PR/link benefit (see earlier in the
thread), but from a user perspective we still want the option to link
in comments.

So switch nofollow with another way to link out without passing link
benefit and damaging a sites SEO and you have a solution. My solution
is to use forms for author links (see comments on my site in the sig,
that site has no nofollow links and doesn't link out with text links
as the author comment links are forms).

This seems pretty shady to many and I would hate to see core do this.  I
would rather see core provide quality semantic code (you know, like only
using forms when you have, I don't know, a form), then play some SEO game.
 the hooks are in place that if you want to modify the content of the output
of your comments, you are more then welcome.  If there is a need for
additional hooks, I fully support adding those.

I think you're missing entirely both the point and philosophy of WordPress,
and also the goals and objectives of the core developers. You're never going
to find WordPress core playing SEO games like this, and nobody wants them to
waste their time and energy on such things.

Simply, the core philosophy of WordPress (as I understand it) is to provide
the easiest solution for self-publishing. To that end, preventing the
distraction of spam is far more important than squeezing out a few more
drops of Google juice. And ironically, what all of the never-ending SEO
games fail to realize is that, by far, the most important SEO tactic
is to *write
quality content*.

Personally, I couldn't care less about my "Page Rank". My motivations for
writing blog posts are varied, but gaining PR isn't one of them.
Nevertheless, Google has managed to find - and to rank highly - some things
that I have written; rankings that are based solely on the degree of
usefulness that others have gained from those posts. For example: how to
synchronize a BlackBerry in
Linux<http://www.google.com/#hl=en&expIds=17259,18167,24472,26637,27147,27154,27404&sugexp=ldymls&xhr=t&q=how+to+synchronize+a+blackberry+in+linux&cp=40&qe=aG93IHRvIHN5bmNocm9uaXplIGEgYmxhY2tiZXJyeSBpbiBsaW51eA&qesig=_9bo8k66gKlZQC63sFs_5A&pkc=AFgZ2tlZ3aZv2I0R3fTJ0DPyPbCzc40o9x69n3BXM5SI37PTzrRJS5MaVv0LnSRgtJat8vnxrtnmM2MsT-kJUZyjDISk9BcZAQ&pf=p&sclient=psy&safe=off&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=how+to+synchronize+a+blackberry+in+linux&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=fc8a743f8bb10773>.
Or another one, written just a few weeks ago - something that I just cranked
out in about an hour, after being inspired by another post that advised
using non-WordPress core implementation for customizing default Gravatars in
WordPress. So, I wrote a response post, quickly explaining the right way to
implement custom default Gravatars. It's already worked its way up to Page
#2 in Google<http://www.google.com/#q=wordpress+custom+default+gravatar&hl=en&safe=off&prmd=iv&ei=UnXXTNeGBIG78gbTgujFBg&start=10&sa=N&fp=fc8a743f8bb10773>-
all without me caring one bit about my site's SEO fu.

(And I'm not even a great, or influential, writer.)

What I'm really trying to say is: WordPress is focused on helping people
publish awesome content in the easiest (and perhaps most enjoyable) way
possible. Trying to argue for these SEO "tricks" in core is really just a
waste of your time, because it will never happen. Some people who are much
smarter than I am are giving you great advice for how to use hooks to make
WordPress work the way you want it to; I'd listen to them, and learn how to
implement their suggestions in your own Theme(s).

Hello guys,

I don't have plenty to say, but I have to agree with Chip. You got my
opinion right on, and more fluently.

Every time I log into WordPress with the Firebug (FF extension) on, a
javascript error occurs on line 46:
try{convertEntities(thickboxL10n);}catch(e){};

This is happening just with me or there?s already a ticket for that? I can?t
find it in Trac.

I don't have this problem.

FF extension saturation?

It works for me! And I guess that at least 99% of people developing for/with WordPress have Firebug installed.

Sometimes Firebug has some strange issues. Normally a restart of the browser is enough. Otherwise try to re-install the extension or deactivate installed WordPress plugins. Maybe it's a plugin causing the JS error.

It?s true, just made another clean install, and no errors.

Since that line have a "thickboxL10n", the problem must be some plugin.

thanks for the tip!

I have the same problem

I don't see in details the problem because I don't have time, but I think
that the problem is when WordPress is working in no default language.

Sorry for my English, is not good.

Possible, but I use it in pt_BR, and a clean install dont have that error,
maybe it?s caused by plugins when you are not using the default language?!

As posted elsewhere:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15124

Please comment on that ticket with more details.

i.e which version/revision are you testing with and which admin page

	targetting
Message-ID: <42DD71D81C744AFDB396A7D21174437F@frumph.net>

I'm trying to target the edit page for a specific post type for 
add_action('admin_print_scripts-' .<location here>

So that the scripts do not load on every admin page, unfortunately i'm just 
*not* getting it how to target that;  I can do it using $_GET['page'] for 
*other* pages or even the hook for the add_submenu_page, unfortunately 
specifically the edit page gets generated from within core and no idea the 
hook.

hrm.. should I do if ($post->post_type == '<posttypename>') ?   but then it 
would hit some of the other admin pages when it shouldn't; $post gets 
generated with some defaults since its blank with the "add new posttype" 
page; blah.

Any ideas?

- Phil


Also, var_dump($wp_query) of course is coming out null, so what would I use 
to check the created variables for those edit pages to see what I could use 
as a specific?

See Otto's answer here:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/understanding-admin_print_scripts-page-hook#post-1172659
and
within your enqueue function, check current_screen for the post_type:

global $current_screen;

if( $current_screen->post_type == 'my-post-type' ) {

    // load scripts

}


(also see here for a cascading post type check:

Message-ID: <ib97u3$r8k$1@dough.gmane.org>

Howdy plugin gurus,

This just recently started happening, with both 
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/qoate-simple-code-snippets.zip
and
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/syntax-highlighter-compress.zip

both of which refused to install (tho I do not think it's directly 
related to either of these plugins, myself) either via the interface or 
manual upload to the interface, resulting in :

	Downloading install package from 
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/qoate-simple-code-snippets.zip?

	Unpacking the package?

	Could not create directory. /wp-content

	Actions: Return to Plugin Installer

(of course if I simply unzip the folder and manually ftp/rsync it to the 
server it works fine)

I tried disabling every other active plugin and retrying the install 
(earlier installs worked just fine) but the result is the same. What 
could have changed to cause this, and how do I fix it?

Yeah I actually tried that after reading how admin-header.php does it, 
unfortunately a var_dump on $current_screen is null at this point in 
execution.

I'm running the add_menu_pages and script hooks in the 'admin_menu' action; 
so it seems to be previous to when $current_screen is populated, hrm.

I always assumed that using add_action('admin_menu', was the appropriate 
hook to execute the plugin's creation of the admin pages ;/  which at that 
point $current_screen is empty.

Think I figured out a work around since $current_screen is null

global $pagenow;
if (($pagenow == 'post-new.php') && ($_GET['post_type'] == 
'custom_post_type')) {
   add_action('admin_print_scripts', 'function_to_execute');
}

this seems to work, then just add_action to the non-hooked 
admin_print_scripts

nevermind, that works for $pagenow == 'post-new.php' but not $pagenow = 
'post.php' where when editing a custom post type post ;/

So, just have to figure out why $current_screen isnt populating

Action for the edit posts(or whatever type) page..

  Scripts
  add_action( 'admin_print_scripts-edit.php', 'your_callback' );

  Styles
  add_action( 'admin_print_styles-edit.php', 'your_callback' );

Assuming you want to target only the post listing page (same hook 
applies for any post type).

For inside the function:

  global $typenow;
  if( 'your_post_type' == $typenow )
  // Do your enqueue

Hope thats what you're after.. ;)

Scott,
This looks to be a permissions problem. Make sure your wp-content and  
plugins folders have the correct permissions (try 775).

$typenow isnt populated on the post.php page, was a great thought though, it 
is however populated on post-new.php and edit.php

See if I wanted to add specific scripts to the post.php and post-new.php 
pages in an meta box on those pages there isnt (so far) a clear way of doing 
that, some vars are being populated on one, but not the other while 
targetting a custom post type.

According to the documentation at
	http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions

"NOTE: For the Automatic Upgrade/Install of Plugins/Themes and WordPress 
Upgrades, No special permissions need to be set. All WordPress files 
should remain owned by your user account (the user account the httpd 
runs as), You should NOT have to make them world writable(777). If you 
attempt to change the ownership/permissions of files in order to allow 
the upgrader to work, There is a high chance of bugs/issues poping up 
related to the incorrect permission scheme chosen."

I've set up a specific ftp/sftp user for this directory, and am using 
the correct password for it. It should 'just work' and the odd thing is, 
it WAS working correctly earlier, and nothing on the server should have 
been changed between the earlier plugin installs and now.

The files in the account all have user.group being the same: i.e. saying 
accountname is foo then an ls -l looks like
	drwxr-xr-x   6 foo foo  4096 Nov  4 13:46 wp-content/
so I don't believe 775 will work and I'm obviously loathe to try 777 for 
those directories. (wp-content/uploads/ IS 777 though)

Possible it could be anything else?

Scott,
Have you changed any of your WordPress structure (i.e. is everything  
still in wp-admin and wp-content)?

No, the blog was only recently installed on the server. I installed a 
few plugins (but haven't activated any of them yet) and two themes (also 
not activated) to play with later, as I familiarize myself with the new 
system and get a handle on where my employer wants to go with things.

The plugins and themes were all installed via the upload interface in 
wordpress, and all worked fine until just recently.

Everything should still be exactly where it should be; I haven't moved 
anything around.

Just to be thorough I also double-checked the .tgz that fantastico uses 
to install wordpress with, and the permissions structure it sets up 
initially is exactly the same as what I have now. So, it should still be 
working just fine.

$typenow should be set for post-new, it was last time i checked in 3.0.1 
...

Some data i collected when building an admin menu can be found here 
(only intended as a quick reference for me whilst writing code).
http://wordpress.pastebin.com/uDYDa4BQ

The only time i've found it's not set is when viewing the tag management 
page and it's the "post" post type.. (it was populated for other post 
types - see pastebin data).

I suppose if necessary you could strpos or substr on $parent_file or 
$submenu_file to figure out the current post type if $typenow isn't 
producing the expected output (but i'd consider that quite hacky - and 
your existing approaches are probably better).

As Scribu said, it might be worth a trac ticket if the var isn't getting 
populated as it should be..

yup, sure did. it's all set exactly as it should be, and hasn't changed 
from the original install that I can see.

anyone else have any thoughts on this?

Scott, try manually ftp'ing something to your server using the same
credentials. I recall running into that error message when my issue was in
fact my ftp setup (users weren't allowed to upload). I know you said
nothing had changed, but it's worth a shot.

Hi Andrew Nacin and all,

I've been following the thread about the new network activation feature 
proposed by scribu on trac

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14170

I'd like to briefly comment on the message you left for me here

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14170#comment:49

I understand your concerns about creating so many tables per blog, and I 
will definitely use your hint to make the lookup tables (3 out of 6) 
global. That will bring down the number of tables created to 3 per blog 
(if we exclude the first one). For 100 blogs in a network, there will be 
303 tables (3 * 100 + 3 global) instead of 600, which is a great 
improvement I think.

I came up with this table structure for my plugin after a step of 
normalization and optimization of the information, so I'd like you to 
elaborate a little more on why you think this is an *awful* lot of 
tables. I could've come up with 2 tables instead of 6 (one for the 
geolocation of IP addresses, one for storing the hits) but then there 
would have been an *awful* lot of redundancy, with a waste of space and 
performance. Most users are using WP Slimstat in a single-blog 
environment and some have more than 1 million hits recorded in their 
main table. With the structure I'm using, I was able to shrink the 
amount of space needed for 10,000 hits to just 1,4 megabytes, with each 
row taking about 150 byte or less.

Andrew, I'm open to rethink this architecture if you can suggest a 
better approach :) In the end, all it matters is to have a plugin that 
does what it is supposed to do, and that does it in the best way 
possible, right?

Could you please elaborate on this? Are you saying I should 'clutter' 
wp_posts with 1 million records just to avoid creating a separate table? 
Doesn't this impact the whole performance when WP will have to access 
that table to retrieve a post or a bit of content?

Thank you,
dino.

Scott,

If this worked, but doesn't now, try to figure out if there have been server
updates between those times. It's possible an updated package reset
permissions. The way the error reads, it can't find the wp-content directory
and the web server doesn't have write access to the root web directory.

Will,

If you've isolated it entirely to a WordPress issue, submit to Trac.

Before submitting to Trac you should remove or rename the mu-plugins and
plugins folders, then recheck the issue. This will unload everything other
than core WordPress.

Some plugins may have unintended functions, so it's usually best to disable
everything, even things that don't seem like they'd have an impact.

If this is, in face, a critical bug in core, you should absolutely submit it
to Trac.  But make sure you also include *steps that are required to
reproduce the problem*.  If it's an intermittent problem with no apparent
cause, we probably can't diagnose it any more quickly than you can.

If, on the other hand, this is a security concern (i.e. someone external to
the site can adjust the permissions of your users through some previously
unknown vulnerability) then report it privately to security at wordpress.org.

Hey guys, it turned out the users not being able to log in/out was a problem with our instance of varnish, so that's not a terrible concern anymore. (Sorry about the initial urgency ? that was about the only thing I hadn't checked.)

As far as users having their permissions bumped, I'm going to wait to submit that one to trac, although I'm fairly certain it's a problem with MS. 

Thanks guys. Sorry again to have bothered y'all.

Looking through WP Slimstat, I see you're storing a ton of information
on a per blog basis. Stats, visits, and outbound.

Why are these not all in one table each? Why give each blog separate
tables? I mean, you could add a measly blog_id integer and combine all
those tables into a total of 6 tables only, no matter how many blogs
there are.

Things like countries and other "static" bits should be hardcoded.
Does the "countries" table update itself in real time or something? If
not, why have it in the database at all? I see it's pulling from a CSV
file.. Why not change that file into a PHP array and then just load
the array and do the substitution that way?

Another point that comes to mind is that, generally speaking, almost
all of this data is never actually used for anything. A lot of stats
plugins are like this, they store data for every hit to the site, but
then only really display charts, graphs, and other summary type
information. Why not just store the results you're going to display
instead of every piece of data about every hit? Lot of duplicated
information there that seems rather pointless, on the whole.

That's a great table based on some time-consuming research.  Why not make it a nicely formatted blog post?  (Or maybe post it to Codex?) 

I could see referencing it and pointing people to it frequently.

Having an issue on an IIS box with the Add an Image thickbox. When going

items. Clicking the tab causes the gallery tab to disappear and an error 
to be shown when I have WP_DEBUG turned on.

Notice: Undefined index: post_id in 
D:\websites\www.site.com\wp-admin\includes\media.php on line 1712

I printed the $_REQUEST to see what I got back and was only seeing:

Array ( [tab] => gallery )

Normally, you should see something like this:

Array ( [post_id] => 122 [type] => image [tab] => gallery )

With that being said, does anybody know why the array isn't being 
populated correctly? There are no plugins other than Akismet installed 
on this site and it *shouldn't* be a theme issue since its on the admin 
side. WordPress version is 3.0.1

Hi Otto,

thank you for your feedback. Please allow me to give you some more 
details about my plugin, so that we can all talk about the same stuff :)

Good question. Of course I could have introduced a blog_id and combine 
all the tables to make the thing scale no matter how big the network is. 
But what is the difference between 100 tables containing 1 million 
records each and 1 table containing 100 million records? The second one 
will be much much slower when performing SELECTS and other operations, 
and will be much bigger than the 100 tables combined, if I enable 
indexing on the most queried fields. I'm not a DB guru, so there's 
probably something I'm missing here.

Hardcoded? I had thought about that, but in other words you're 
suggesting that it's better to load a 3.5 Mb array into memory EVERY 
TIME the plugin has to record a new hit, than querying the database to 
find the same information, am I right? My Wordpress is already taking 48 
megabyte of RAM to load and perform each single request, should I really 
add 3.5 more megabytes to the pile? I mean, if you think this is the way 
to go, and that it performs better than a DB query, I'll do it :-) But 
when then users will complain about their RAM usage, I'll send them to 
you, ok? :)

Sorry, but this is not the case with WP SlimStat. It allows you to 
drill-down into the metrics, filtering data, and ultimately giving you 
access to the 'raw data' that users can browse and inspect line by line. 
It's not just a bunch of graphs and charts, please try it by yourself :-)

You have a point here, however I think you're thinking of an edge
case. 1 million records of hits is too much to be storing in the first
place. That should be paired down on a regular basis to far fewer. Get
the data you want, then dump it out elsewhere. Realistically, if I was
storing raw data like that, then I wouldn't put it in a database to
begin with, I'd use a flat file and process out what I actually need
in batches, then store that.

No, I'm saying that you don't need to record the country at all in the
first place. You need to know the country at display time, not at raw
data grabbing time. Raw data should be *raw*. Fast. Efficient for
writing. Save the processing for later.

Yes, but do you actually have any stats on how often this is actually
done? The fact that you've made it possible to do something that is
rather pointless doesn't mean that lots and lots of people actually do
that pointless thing.

Nobody wants the raw data except for eggheads like you and me, and
then we really want it to be able to see trends over time, charts,
most often used search queries, etc. Do you really spend your day
going to the basic data level to see individual hits? Why would you
ever do that?

It's totally *pointless* to store the last million hits to your site.
Abstract out the data you actually want from it, store that, then
trash the data.

Okay, maybe that was a little exaggerated, but even with 100,000 
records, what's the difference bw 100 tables holding 100k records and 
one storing 10M? It 'scales' just because it doesn't create new tables, 
but other than that it's the same thing space-wise. Unless you core 
developers are saying that adding new tables is deprecated and should 
never be done.

So you would do a JOIN bw two tables, one with 100k records and one with 
150k, for EACH metric included in WP? Interesting...

Well, I would ask that to the 2,000+ users who are currently using my 
plugin :-) Maybe it's not just you and me...

Using new tables makes it almost impossible for people using multisite
configs to use your plugin properly. It's an epic pain in the ass to
upgrade, basically. Even installing it takes bloody forever.

You're thinking that it's no big deal to make new tables for 100
sites. You're thinking too small. When I think of "large" multisite
sites, I'm thinking 100k+ blogs on them, using multiple SQL servers.

It is best to avoid using new tables for anything, ever, if you want
multisite people to be able to use your plugin. I have maybe 10 sites
on my config, and I'd instantly reject your plugin out  of hand
because it creates new tables, period.

No, I wouldn't store the unchanging data in the database in the first
place. If it doesn't change, it doesn't need to be in the database.

The number of times you'll need to actually see the country is far less 
than the number of times you're currently looking it up. I agree with 
Otto, when it comes to statistics,
and especially these types of stats, store the info as quickly as 
possible, writing to mysql will always be your slowest, and longest 
operation. Every insert usually requires an
update to the index.

Using it versus how they're using it :).

I say all of these not as an expert on WordPress core, but as someone 
who worked on an analytics package that handled millions of visits per

Although using forms to serve author URLs isn't shady, I wasn't
suggesting using forms this way in core WordPress, mainly because it
would probably break (mess up the formatting) of every theme available
today. I was pointing out there is at least one solution, so others
who like me understand SEO and want the most from WordPress have a
solution at theme level.

For those interested in using forms to stop comment author URLs
passing link benefit without using the nofollow attribute, it's not
blackhat SEO, because you are not trying to game the search engines**.
Google wants webmasters to NOT pass link benefit to sites they are not
reccomending. That was the whole point of the introduction of nofollow
in the first place, unfortunatly Google moved the goal posts on
nofollow presumably because there are those that abuse nofollow by
attempting to sculpt PR by nofollowing internal pages (contact, about
etc...). It could be argued those who use nofollow to sculpt PR for
example those who use plugins like All in One SEO are being pennalised
by Google, they are loosing a LOT of link benefit.

** I have about 70 WordPress installations running a theme with the
author URLs as forms (most of my traffic is from Google, currently at
around 40,000 unique visitors a day). I have hundreds of customers
running the same theme and I've never had a report of a customer
having worse search engine rankings after using the theme. I'll add I
tested the concept on my own sites for over 6 months before adding the
code to the theme I send to customers.

Anyway, as it is I'm happy to know WordPress development are aware of
the damaging aspects of nofollow and hopefully they'll try to limit
it's use in the future. I know it's a difficult problem to solve, if
it was easy I wouldn't be using forms to solve the issue :-)

You should be able to apply the changes to your current 3.0.1? install and see if that resolved the issue?

So, correct me if I'm wrong, you're saying that the majority of plugins 
out there are 'crap' because they dare to create new tables? Is this the 
official position of Wordpress for this specific issue? I think that's a 
fairly strong statement, but we are probably off-topic now.

Thanks anyway,

The guideline is to avoid creating new tables whenever possible, yes. 
Sometimes they are necessary, but it's one of the first things I see the 
lead developers look at when they look at a plugin, and I've heard them 
advise many plugin developers to revise their plugins to get rid of 
unnecessary tables.

I for one will say this.

The very vast majority of plugins does not create a table, and among the 
few that do, probably 80% should not.

Its IIS v6.0.

Just read over that ticket and the uploads aren't failing. They're being 
added to the library without issue. The issue happens after you close 
the thickbox window and then re-open it. The $_REQUEST (actually $_GET) 
array isn't being set properly and is missing some entries which then 
causes the gallery tab to disapear. Coincidentally, it also happens when 
you load that page outside the thickbox window.

Nice catch. it does indeed appear to be the sftp side of things -- ftp 
works fine but sftp is currently failing (even though I can ssh to the 
box just fine as well) I'll look into it.

I'll let you all know whether this solves it (but I suspect it will). 
However the error message should have indicated that ftp failed, not 
that it was unable to create the necessary directory path.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Fix for is_home() in combination with custom post type?
Message-ID: <4CD96E5E.7070501@gmail.com>

Hi,

It seems I'm experiencing a known problem[1] with is_home reporting true 
on custom post index pages. I thought to have found a solution in 
somadesign.ca's class[2], but that does not seem to work.

I'm referring to using the template_redirect hook to set is_home to 
false on my custom posts index page. This does set is_home to false and 
then it is being set to true again.

I'm using this function which is almost a complete copy of 
Somadesign.ca's class (thanks!): https://gist.github.com/669261

What am I doing wrong? What can I do to fix is_home()? Do I need to use 
a different hook? Hints and tips most appreciated!

query_posts is doing it

You should use a different method for what your trying to accomplish, as in 
the loop that uses the query,  me?  I use some custom functions I wrote that 
protect() and unprotect() the main wp_query while doing any other loops 
within sections, i.e. custom post type sections

http://wp.pastebin.com/hesq0Ez3

That way as soon as the loop is over it resets it back to the default 
wp_query and post data

That's essentially what wp_resetpostdata() and wp_reset_query() do.

He was probably referring specifically to "keywords" in the meta,
which nobody pays attention to anymore.

As far as I can find, all the plugins out there work at the post level,  not the specific threaded comment level.

I'd first jump to IIS 7 :-)

At this point I'd suggest you create a ticket.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikNwJJR+Rw4iU8Tf388C9qSSKm7eV6USb1E8Zem@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

So.. i've been developing a plugin for WP Multi-Site. i've used
('get_site_option') to store the network-wide settings...

when i usually make a settings page, i use
'register_setting<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_setting>'
and 'action="options.php"'. however, i've noticed that there's no
alternative for the site options (like 'register_site_setting')... so i had
to use the 'sanitize_callback' and call 'update_site_option' from there...

is there any thing that i'm missing here?

Message-ID: <309aed6b-bf11-46c5-9fd2-70a62c8d2958@26g2000yqv.googlegroups.com>

Hi,

a half year ago or so i put a ticket &patch on trac [1] for a single
stylesheet on the login screen. Goal was/is to make it easier to
integrate the login screen into themes, having one less request, less
to load (in size) and to unbundle wp-login from the admin area. The
patch worked until 2.9 or so, but needs some minor rework to fit into
the new css scheme. Therefore i quickly made a plugin [2] but noticed
that i'm not able to get completely rid of the two current
stylesheets. I know that i somehow can filter wp_admin_css and
wp_admin_css_uri (general-template.php), but so far i couldn't get
around it. I hope someone can help me a little, because i want to
offer the plugin to interessted people in the repository and don't
wanna have two requests going into the blue.

Btw: If you like the idea, please go to trac and vote or comment on
the ticket. Thanks.

Wish you best.
- Kaiser.

I wish it were easy to jump to IIS 7. She's on 1&1 hosting... Its a path 
I'd rather not take for my own sanity.

I'm going to do some more troubleshooting once I get a chance and see 
what I find.

I can?t find a syntax highlighter for the WordPress theme editor, only for
inserting code (PHP, CSS, ...) in posts.

Any tip on a plugin?

This is not really a safe way to schedule events. Basically, you have
a race condition. What happens if I fire off three requests to your
site in rapid succession? Before the first one has finished, another
one hits? Websites are multithreaded. More than one copy of the site
can run at a time, and you can't guarantee the code to run in a
straight line.

Unfortunately, we don't have the equivalent of a mutex to work with.
So you simply have to make your code smart enough to deal with the
fact that it could run several times. Storing a time indicator in your
function and updating it and then only running when it has elapsed
might be a better way to go here.

At one point there was a pretty elaborate JS editor-enhancement added to the
theme editor in core, but it was removed because it caused a lot of problems
for a lot of people. The problem with enhancing the wp-admin editor screens
is that if someone is actually using them then they are probably working on
a live site, and in that situation any issues can become nightmares.
Whatever is making someone use the theme editor instead of FTP+real editor
has a decent chance of also stopping them from being able to fix the site if
they break it using the theme editor.

Ideally the theme editor should never be used. It is an emergency tool
included because sometimes people get stuck with WP configured in an
inconvenient way. Rather than improve it you should fix your setup so you
don't have to use it at all.

Whatever your situation is that requires detailed edits to the theme, you
need to find another way to accomplish your goal. Most likely a local
installation using Mamp/xamp to run a copy of the site for development is
the best idea, that way you can use proper code editing tools and avoid
taking down the live site with a PHP syntax error. When you are happy with
how the theme works you can just paste in the results once.

Alternately, if you have a part of your theme that needs regular edits, you
should add some widget areas and control the content form the admin that
way. Much cleaner than editing the theme itself.

A reliable way is to put the scheduling in your plugin activation hook - that tends to run in a less racey way :-)

There are some situations where a client calls and ask for a little change
in CSS, like some link color adjust or something like that, and im not home
or have access to a pc with ftp blablabla... So if I have access to a PC
with Internet, im totally able to fix it quickly.

It would be very handy if we have such syntax highlight or/and line numbers.

The question remains, if anyone have a solution for that, please help me!!

I try to always use version control. I know Andrew Nacin was working on something with versioning in the editor for his GSoC project, but I'm not sure where that went. 

I'm a proponent of having every change to a site in a vcs - no matter how big or small it is.

You also leave open the possibility that the client (if they have privileges) will go on a joyride and pretend to know CSS, which I've seen plenty of times.

From memory, there are a few plugins (but not sure where) that do add functionality there, and you could probably unbury the patch from trac and spin it off.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikkRoXgYALK4suVPdoe_xF3Xyb0i5CA6R69n+a5@mail.gmail.com>

Running into an interesting issue that I can't seem to find a solution for:

I have a custom post type / taxonomy registered in functions.php and
using wp_dropdown_categories to display it in a dropdown list.
That works great, displays my taxonomy (skills) perfectly but they
link incorrectly.

The url that it generates is:
url.com/?skills=28&submit=view

But if I just use the normal wp_list_categories to list them out, they
work (link) perfectly to:

/skills/flash/

If tried refreshing / updating my permalinks and it doesn't work...

Thoughts?

hi,

Sorry for the cross post for those of you who are on the HipHop
mailing list as well. I thought some of you may be interested in our
findings about the performance of Wordpress on HipHop and our custom

performance.

We have written two white papers about the topic and there is some
discussion on the HipHop mailing list for the interested ones.

One of the Google Summer of Code students for HipHop also adapted WordPress
to work on the platform.

I haven't been able to track down a good set of patches, but I would love to
see them filed upstream.

we initially ported ourselves and later merged in the changes of Hui
Chen (the GSoC student you mentioned) and added our patches in a

David,

before you insult people, check out who you're insulting. If you're this
good, beat me at "WordPress SEO" in the rankings [1]. I've been doing SEO
for 8 years and been getting results all that time, the best SEO's in the
world will tell you I know what I'm doing. [2] I wrote the first canonical
plugin for WordPress before it was in core because Matt Cutts himself saw
fit to ask me to do that. [3] Please, seriously, go play somewhere else with
your AdSense Templates. Some of us make money doing SEO on actual sites that
don't have to hide doing SEO.

I wanted to insert some expletives there but refrained from doing that.
Couldn't refrain from this rant though.

Seriously, stop wasting the valuable time of the great developers on this
list and go help your customers some more.

Best
Joost

Hello there.

Yesterday we had a WordPress meeting (spanish friends :)) and we were
talking about syntax highlighter.

Do you know if exists any syntax highlighter plugin to highlight HTML in
HTML posts editor? Some of us proposed to make a plugin for this and don't
know if it already exists.

Do you think it may be useful?

Thanks in advance.

Totally useful, and about that, yesterday i?ve submitted a mail to this
list, asking for any tips about a syntax highlighter in WP Theme Editor,
which I think would be totally awsome...

I think I should code that myself.

Awesome! If you need any help, here I am :). Working with github?

About syntax highlighter in WP Theme Editor, it can be very useful. I must
agree in preferring not allowing user to edit anything, but when you are
mobile it is indeed very useful if you need to change any template
on-the-fly for a customer.

Hello,

when using password protected post and user inserts right password, then it is probably saved in cookies, because when displaying this post again, no password is required. But it is problem for some users (for public computers, etc.).
I did not find any hook to change this behaviour and require password everytime.
Is there any chance to do it as a small plugin?

Thank you for your help...

This works for me:

add_action( 'wp', 'post_password_immediately_expires' );
function post_password_immediately_expires() {
    if ( isset( $_COOKIE['wp-postpass_' . COOKIEHASH] ) )
        setcookie('wp-postpass_' . COOKIEHASH, '', time() - 31536000,
COOKIEPATH);
}

Message-ID: <AANLkTikmr6ostfYE+j1UTDdbEFbCFfaJPSVuV+a=wT87@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

in the wp_get_attachment_url() we have the following check

    if ( 'attachment' != $post->post_type || empty($url) )
        return false;

I was wondering if we really need this check for attachment post_type. If
the post have a "_wp_attached_file" postmeta record, isnt it enough?

Now with custom post types I think we are going to have other post types
that could behave as attachments. I do this with some "audio" post type,
which are uploaded audio files by the user. But I cant use
wp_get_attachment_url() because it will allways return false...

What do you think?

A "post" should never have an attached file like that. Attachments get
their own post for them, with the post_type of "attachment" and other
metadata about the attachment stored in the post_meta. They're
connected to the original post via the post_parent.

Similarly, I can't think of a good reason for a custom post type to
have an attached file. It should have attachment posts hooked to it
instead. Without the attachment posts, there's no place to store the
specific meta information about the file.

Ok. This is how it worked so far.

But I think we can think of a new way to llok at it. We have now the
possibility to create new post types, we could have new 'attachment post
types'. For instance: 'portfolio image' and 'clipping'.

This could be an option in register_post_type().

Dont you think it would be usefull?

I don't see the need for new attachment types. Taxonomies for attachments on
the other hand, sure.

No, that's not useful. An attachment is an attachment. Giving it a
different post_type name doesn't make it functionally different, it
just breaks all the assumptions in the core code.

You're using post_types wrong. A post_type describes the type of the
item, not a categorization of it. A "portfolio image" and a "clipping"
are both still attachments so you don't need a separate post_type for
them.

If you want to have different ways of categorizing things, then you
should use categories, or tags, or a custom taxonomy. Custom
post_types define what things actually are. Custom taxonomies are
there to sort them into different buckets.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Reusing queries
Message-ID: <C54C97DA-740B-4378-A09E-EB83E5622F45@gmail.com>

The site I'm working on doesn't use embedded images with posts but  
instead uses a few functions to see if there are images attached to  
the post, if those images meet a number of parameters, and finally to  
display those images.

So the call for an image usually looks something like this:
if(has_image() && image_meets_params()) {
	image();
}

The problem is, each of those functions queries the database, so the  
number of queries on a page can potentially explode.

has_image() checks to see if there are any images attached to the post  
at all
image_meets_params() grabs the first image and checks the meta to see  
if it is a horizontal or vertical image and checks the width
and then finally image() displays the image or images.

Is there a way to reuse some of these queries from one function to  
another, so for example if has_image returns true it then passes all  
the information onto image_meets_params? Or are these queries light  
enough that I need not even be worrying about it?

You should store the results in the Object Cache if you want to avoid running the queries again.

Look at the functions in wp-includes/cache.php

The default Object Cache is for the current page but there are ones to persist the contents over page views as well using Memcache, APC, XCache etc.

Try assigning variables in each of your conditionals. Its a real basic
optimization, but it can save you time and code. I don't know the specific
functions you're using, but something like this:

if ( ( $image = wp_get_attachment_image_src( $attachment_ID ) ) &&
     ( $image[1] >= $min_width ) && ( $image[2] >= $min_height ) )
     echo '<img src="'.$image[0].'" >';

There are a lot of functions which return data rather than simply
true/false, so you can simplify your code and the number of db queries a bit
by using them.

That said, I don't know how much you should be worrying about a couple extra
queries per page. I think all of the API functions are designed to be
optimized as far as query structure and indexes. 5 or 10 extra queries per
page should be nothing to stress out over, as long as you're hapy with the
code it took to get them.

Message-ID: <4FEFCDD1-2C48-40FB-A06B-129C3140DE3D@mahunneysfarm.com>

Problem: Child theme with no 404 template defaults to parent theme 404 on non-existent path or document (as expected).  The parent 404 was fine for my purpose so I did not make a copy into the child theme folder.   My specific issue was with php include() files being pulled from the parent folder (due to relative file reference) instead of the edited versions I created in the child folder.

I see that get_template_part works around this issue by searching STYLESHEETPATH and then TEMPLATEPATH and seems like a better way to include?  Or is include a bad idea with child themes?

Always include template-part files using get_template_part() - primarily,
for the reason you indicate (it will search first in the Child Theme, and
then in the Parent Theme).

Note: the Parent Theme should be including template-part files in the same
way.

Message-ID: <053AAA78-792A-4CE5-9FB6-710EEFF1D02F@radiopicture.com.au>

Hi All,

I've come along an interesting problem - I need to query a taxonomy by post type with a rewrite rule and query var, and I'm not quite sure how to approach this.

I've got a taxonomy for different types of topics that I've called "topics". The ideal solution would be to to be able to approach this with /topic/demo/post_type/guide, or /topic/demo/post_type/challenge - but I've never done anything like this, and documentation on the rewrite rule front of things is sparse if any. 

Does anyone have any pointers? I'm not sure if an endpoint would be suitable for something like this.

For testing, I tend to use XAMPP on Windows, which is a full
Apache/MySQL/PHP stack. It's nice and easy and self-contained. I
probably wouldn't try to run a production site on it, but you could,
with some tweaking.

No, not by any means.. I've played with doing WordPress on IIS just for 
fun and quickly decided my definition of "fun" was way off base.

There are several alternatives that can get you running a site on Apache 
with WordPress well within 20 minutes on your Windows machine.  Here are 
two popular installation packages:

XAMPP : http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html
WAMP : http://www.wampserver.com/en/
(For mac there is also http://www.mamp.info/ )

I've always used XAMPP and run it on all my PCs for local testing of 
sites (& doing dev work while on planes w/ no wifi). One word of warning 
for running this on PCs: Skype by default grabs port 80 and won't let 
Apache launch when open unless you change that setting.

There are contributors who run on IIS as tickets come through and get 
fixed, but it is a vast minority. Perhaps someone else can give you a 
better number...

The zend stack is production grade, I use it on linux, and like it, and is self contained as well.  I just worry about security, and scaling, not to mention losing a shell, and tools like vi, grep, diff, etc.

I have a few WordPress sites installed on a Windows server sitting in
my garage running IIS6, PHP5.x, and MySQL5.x. The only problem I've
ever ran into was setting up WPMU.
I think I still have the document I created but will have to locate it.

Thanks in advance, as google did not give me much other than opinions.

There is "real" apache, php and mysql binaries for windows as well, w/o zend
server. I am in a small web devel shop and we use the XAMPP approach (Apache
2.2 and php5.2) for those that feel they have to have windows. We had some
nuisance issues with php5.3 so backed  down to 5.2. We've also done Windows
host + Linux virtualbox, and vice versa. All that seems to work well enough.
The only issue we've had is permissions related when sharing a ntfs drive in
a vbox set up (everything winds up 0777 which drives me bonkers).

In our set up, we use a remote mysql server, so that does not run locally
for us. But Apache + php do. Everybody runs their own repo code checkout
too, so nobody steps on anyone else's toes.

We have not really hit the skype issue mentioned by someone else.

You probably have Apache launching as a service first before Skype 
starts up.  It's only an issue when Skype launches first, grabs the 
port, and then you try to start your server..

The setting is under Tools>Options>Advanced>Connection>"Use port 80 and 
443 as alternatives for incoming connections". I would imagine it's 
there to help get past firewall issues, but it is annoying in this 
circumstance.

Only a few regular core contributors develop on Windows (ask me to name one,
though, and I'll likely draw a blank). Only one committer does, though two
of us also used to. As far as I know, everyone uses/used Apache as their
primary web server, typically XAMPP. Of course, some of us also test on IIS.

WordPress supports IIS7 out of the box, including URL rewriting / pretty
permalinks. Microsoft expends quite a bit of effort to make sure WordPress
continues to runs well on IIS7.x. They even have this site,
http://wordpress.visitmix.com/, which has on it an SQL Server database layer
if you're so inclined. And whenever we have an IIS issue we can safely lean
on ruslany, who handles FastCGI and PHP support for Microsoft's IIS team and
is a core contributor.

So, yes, WordPress will work on IIS7, quite well in fact.

Thanks, all, that gives me the confidence to try it, at least.  I think I will stick to a proven stack such as apache mysql and php, I will probably go with Zend Server as I am already using Zend Community Server under linux, and find it a good solution.

I will miss bash, grep, vi, etc, though....

thanks,

If you install Git for Windows (msysgit 
http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/), it installs a good swath of shell 
tools and can add them to your path.

it's actually really cool to be able to do an "ls -Al" and "chmod" from 
the Windows7 command prompt and have them work.  Or you could download 
just the ones you want from their repository 
http://repo.or.cz/w/msysgit.git/tree/HEAD:/bin

Cool, I hadn't heard about that, I assumed source control would be out as well.  At least as I know it. :)  I will check into it, especially since it has some real tools to help.

rather than responding here, I've put my response at

Also wrote a full (very detailed) review of the plugin in question at 

http://www.google-adsense-templates.co.uk/yoast-wordpress-seo-plugin-review.html

Comments are open on both pages.

I won't respond on the list regarding this thread again unless I've

I might be missing something but couldn't you do something more like

$post_images =
get_children("post_parent=$post->ID&post_type=attachment&post_mime_type=image");

if (is_array($post_images) and count($post_images)) :
  foreach ($post_images as $id => $details) :
        // VALIDATE THE IMAGE THEN DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH IT.
  endforeach;
endif;

I'm pretty sure the results from get_children() will give you access to the
data you need about the images, and you'd only have to do the one query to
get all the data. You might end up with some extras for postmeta or
something, but you would probably have had those extra queries with your
other system anyway.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Checking getmyuid results in problems?
Message-ID: <4CE12A0A.5060900@ayavo.nl>

Hi.

Here's my first post to the hacker mailing list. I've spent half my day 
helping out a co-worker who has been experiencing problems with WPAU, as 
a click on "upgrade automatically" on the Plug-ins page would result in 
a form asking for FTP credentials and servername, and there's no FTP 
server running on his localhost. I've been in the business for quite a 
while, contributing to other projects, and earning my paycheck by 
writing applications for customers, so I'm rather well-known with 
permissions on Unix. Obviously, my first remark was: make sure that the 
Apache user can write to the directories and files that wordpress has 
installed.

So he did: his username was his local username (e.g. 'berry'), the group 
was 'www-data', and the filepermissions were 0775, meaning the group 
'www-data' was able to write to the files. Please do note that there was 
at that time no problem to write wp-config.php from the installation 
wizard, and it was also possible to edit plugins with the embedded 
plugins editor. However, there was still no possibility to update the 
plugins.

Now, having a <user>:www-data owner on files isn't that unusual: it's a 
rather common way of making sure that your own user as well as the 
apache user can write to the files. It's important to stress that 
development doesn't happen on a remote FTP server, as we're a software 
company, we develop on development machines and we *never* develop on 
production servers. A call to is_writable( ) would result in true, so I 
figured it ought to work. It didn't. After debugging for quite some 
time, I found a line in the wordpress core which contained the following 
code:

     if ( getmyuid() == @fileowner($temp_file_name) ).

It seems the Apache user *must* be the owner of the files, before 
Wordpress WPAU will even try to update the plugins, which is unexpected 
behaviour, from my point of view. My logic is that if the user is able 
to write to files, that would be enough to write to files. In the case 
of WPAU, this isn't true. While searching though the bug tracker, I've 
found several previous tickets about this exact problem, such as #8400 
and #10424.

In #8400, DD32 responds with 'wontfix'. In #10424, DD32 responds to the 
ticket with an explanation which makes sense, but mostly for shared 
webhosting. Now, I'm sure that most users of Wordpress have the 
application hosted on shared webhosting, and they never have a local 
copy to develop in. However, the people that write code for a living 
usually have multiple environments to write, test and run their code on. 
In our case, developing and the first testing happens on a local 
machine. We write, debug and test our code using an IDE. That makes it 
very awkward for www-data to be the owner of the files that wordpress 
should edit, because you have to either change the owner to 
www-data:<user> and chmod to 077x, or run your IDE by using su - 
www-data, which is obviously a workaround I dislike.

Now, I wouldn't mind the getmyuid to fileowner check much if that was 
well-documented and consistent, but it seems that it's not. You see, 
wp-config.php was written after the installation-wizard without 
performing the check, and I can edit the plugins using the embedded 
editor, without the check being performed. It's just the updating of 
plugins that doesn't seem to work. That's the reason I assumed I had an 
issue with the plugin files not being writable, while they actually were 
writable.

I've written a patch (attached) to use is_writable instead of getmyuid 
and fileowner, which makes the whole installation work like a charm. Am 
I wrong in assuming that the files being writable should be the only 
check necessary, or is there some logic that I am still overlooking, 
which makes the check make sense? Yes, a lot of (shared) hosting servers 
are not that well configured. Yes, once you run Apache as another user 
than the owner, this will result in a different owner upon writing new 
files. But isn't this only relevant in production and shouldn't that be 
fixed by the webhoster, and not by the software?


Cheers,

Berry.

The owner of the files must be the same as the current uid of the
process, not the "apache" user.

On shared webhosts, the php process is often configured to run with
the same ownership as the PHP files. This enhances security on a
shared hosting solution, since somebody gaining access via the
webserver will only gain the credentials of that user, not of the
apache user.

Your patch (which didn't come through the mailing list) will very
likely not be accepted into the core because you've changed the owner
of the files. If you do that, then the original owner no longer has
access permissions to them, which is unacceptable in a production
environment. Furthermore, the files are now owned by the apache user,
which will be the credentials of somebody hacking their way in via the
webserver process. So you've created a security risk as well. Not
changing the owner is important. You can't just throw that away.

Instead, you should investigate a method of setuid. If you run
mod_php, then the "suphp" package will do the trick. There's also ways
to do setuid of the php process using FastCGI and so forth. This sort
of installation will ensure that the process is running as the owner
of the PHP files, allowing the upgrader to create files with the
correct owner.

On re-reading your email, I see that you're confusing two different things.

Editing is just that: editing. It changes the file, it doesn't replace it.

During an upgrade, the old version is deleted, the new version is
unpacked, and the files are moved into place. The files are *created*
by the apache process, and so will inherit the ownership/group of the
process. This is undesirable, and why the FTP process was made, so
that WP can create the files via FTP with the credentials of the user,
and thus the files will be owned by that user.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=GixjJY+wh+0z2p-NLBO9KHWJyXJPvsZZjM+sy@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
may be it's good idea to replace this in wp-includes/query.php:1759
if ( '' != $q['name'] ) {

width this:

if ( '' != $q['name'] && !$q['p']) {

This way the query will not contains post_name='...' if there is post
ID passed. This will make query faster, because it will use only
wp_posts primary key instead of making query by index and table scan.


End the bug that i found is:
some months ago i installed fresh wordpress on the server that doesn't
have php mb_string functions, so the function
sanitize_title_with_dashes (wp-includes/formatting.php:814) just
doesn't do str to lower title values. But week ago i installed the mb
string library for php and the old slugs stop working. That's because
this code (part of wp-includes/formatting.php:814)  now works:

if (function_exists('mb_strtolower')) {
	$title = mb_strtolower($title, 'UTF-8');
}

Adding the patch at the top of this mail solves the problem for me.

First of all: thank you for your (very quick) reply, it's appreciated. I 
may have been a little ambiguous in my previous mail, for which I 
apologise. I'm fully aware that the owner of the files must be the user 
that runs the php-process, which in my case (default apache/php 
installation on ubuntu) is 'www-data'. For a local development 
environment, I consider this to be "good enough", as www-data can 
read/write PHP files.

>    

I'm using apache2_ mpm_itk to accomplish just this in production. Other 
servers I maintain use suexec for this. Nevertheless, my question sterns 
from the fact that this is unpractical on a development environment, 
where you usually don't change the default Apache user, while you unpack 
Wordpress itself from your own user. So, my files are (by default) owned 
by me, while Apache is executing PHP scripts with 'www-data', which 
doesn't have to be an issue as long as there's no check on uid. Once the 
check is in place, it means that I'll have to log on to my PC as the 
owner of the files, which doesn't have my .vimrc, .zshrc and stuff. Yes, 
there's another option of putting myself in the group that owns the 
file, so I can at least edit them under my own username, and that works 
for me, but it took me a few hours to figure out that that was necessary.

I do understand where you're coming from, but I'm talking about my 
development environment, where it's everything but unacceptable to leave 
the user to your own uid, instead of creating yet another user for yet 
another project. I've merely replaced the check that getmyuid and 
fileowner has to be equal to a call to is_writable( $context ). That 
means you leave the check to the OS, instead of trying to do the 
servers' work yourself.

>   Furthermore, the files are now owned by the apache user, which will be the credentials of somebody hacking their way in via the webserver process. So you've created a security risk as well. Not changing the owner is important. You can't just throw that away.
>    

I assure you: I haven't imposed a security risk, my PC is in a LAN which 
is not reachable from the internet. Please allow me to state one last 
time: I'm not talking about a production machine, I'm talking about my 
own personal computer, located under my desk. Once I start uploading 
Wordpress to production (or rather, synching it using version control), 
I make sure the uid is correct on the server.

The thing I want to relay is that - although your reasoning seems sound 
for production environments - this non-typical behavior is causing 
headaches for people who develop their software on local development 
machine. If you're not inclined to leave the uid checks to the OS, at 
least make sure the end users know this, so they don't have to wonder 
why Wordpress won't update the plugins, although wordpress is able to 
write to the files.

Cheers,

Berry.

This kind of statement is usually an indicator that it would be good 
plugin territory. There are many developers running local copies of WP, 
and many using IDEs, so maybe they can chime in with how they approach 
the issue you're encountering, but a plugin targeted at developers using 
a setup like yours would probably be greatly appreciated by the community.

Yes, that is very related. It sums up my two main issues very well: 1) 
Wordpress shouldn't care about UID, but merely "can I write?", and 2) If 
there must be a check on UID's, at least explain why it won't upgrade 
the plugins. It's good to see it's not just me. :)

I use XAMPP on Ubuntu too and I cannot do automatic upgrades of plugins or
WP itself either. I was mad when the team got the WordPres importer out of
core as I had to download it every time I needed it. Basically I have a set
of plugins downloaded from browser and I use them and have not bother to ask
to make this one automatic. But if there is a hack to make upgrades work on
local machines, I would use that for sure.

There is: you can define( 'FS_METHOD', 'direct' ) somewhere in config, 
which would result in the bypassing of the getmyuid( ) == fileowner( ) 
call altogether. My most important question is why there is no notice of 
this, unless you Google around a lot :)

Thanks for that Berry - it seems to do the trick - but I still get this:

Setting everything to 777 is normally not very advisable. If you set 
your owner to <yourusername>:<php-process> and chmod to 0775, that 
should be enough to get it to work.

I'll hold you to that (-:. Please do note that you don't want to do that 
in a production environment, but in a development environment, a 
"quick-fix" like this isn't unusual.

For dev environments the quick fix is this as long as the apache user can create the files:

define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');

In wp-config.php

Hi is there a way to automatically assign new users to selected blogs?

in my case every new user has to be assigned to a couple of blogs and 
has to have a certain "level"
i've tried the user-role-editor-wordpress-plugin/ but it does not cut 
the cake for me...

any suggestions?

thanks in advance

Hi Peter,

I've written a plugin that does exactly that, see here:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multisite-user-management/

This email list isn't really for finding plugins though.

Peter,

You can use the action *user_register* in *wp_insert_user* to call *
add_user_to_blog* after the user is created.

See http://codex.wordpress.org/WPMU_Functions/add_user_to_blog for details
on *add_user_to_blog*.

Erick

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom post publish: show error $notice in stead of
	update $message
Message-ID: <90BDE376-94F1-472F-8792-4DB0A47F0906@multipop.org>

Hi all,

I'm using a validation function which fires when publishing a particular custom post type:

add_action( 'publish_my_custom_post_type', 'validate_my_custom_post_type' );

function validate_my_custom_post_type() {
	global $post;
	if ( $some_form_value == '' ) {
		$sendback = admin_url( 'post.php?post='.$post->ID.'&action=edit&message=200' );
		wp_redirect( $sendback );
		exit;
	}
}


Although I'm able to filter the feedback messages to show a message when the condition is not met, prompting the user to take action..

add_filter( 'post_updated_messages', 'my_custom_post_type_feedback' );

function my_custom_post_type_feedback( $messages ) {
	$messages['my_custom_post_type']['200'] = __( 'Some feedback message.', 'my_i18n_identifier' );
	return $messages;
}

..I'm looking to show a $notice (error message, different color) in stead if a $message, but haven't found a way to do so.
Any pointers on how to accomplish this?

Cheers,

Barry

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Post Types, Pretty URLs and Custom Query Vars
Message-ID: <AANLkTimtxEDFNG9MB6nbHC8UOUh26Tu0v6H+qZXvRM=1@mail.gmail.com>

I am currently in the process of adding a custom post type (job) to a
WordPress install via a plugin.

I have successfully setup the custom post type, added some meta boxes,
gotten everything saving happily, stopped autosave from removing my custom
fields etc etc.

I have also installed the Custom Post Type Archives plugin so that I have
nice URLs
http://mywp.com/jobs/ works as a list of jobs
http://mywp.com/jobs/job-title goes to individual job posts

jobs have a custom field related to them of "company"

However, I also want to have the URL structure...

http://mywp.com/jobs/company/3

...show a list of jobs which are all with the company of id 3 (it'd be nice
to use the company name, but for now id is fine)
Pagination must still work so

http://mywp.com/jobs/company/3/page/2 needs to also work

First of all, I have registered my query var:

function setup_query_vars( $query_vars )
  {
    $query_vars[] = 'company';
    return $query_vars;
  }
add_filter('query_vars', 'setup_query_vars');


Also, I have setup a filter so that if the post type is job, and the company
query var is set, wp_query is updated like so:
function filter_for_company_jobs($wp_query)
  {
    if(!is_admin() && isset($wp_query->query_vars['post_type']) &&
$wp_query->query_vars['post_type'] == 'job' &&
isset($wp_query->query_vars['company']))
    {
      $wp_query->query_vars['meta_key'] = 'company';
      $wp_query->query_vars['meta_compare'] = '=';
      $wp_query->query_vars['meta_value'] =
$wp_query->query_vars['company'];
    }
  }
 add_action( 'parse_query', 'filter_for_company_jobs', 90 );

So far so good, the URL:

http://mywp.com/jobs/?company=3

works and so does

http://mywp.com/jobs/page/2/?company=3

So all I need to do is get a rewrite working so that the URL structure is
"pretty".
However every attempt to do this results in my "company" query var
disappearing. Pagination remains, but I end up with a full list of jobs, not
just those relating to the company, and there is no record of "company" in
$wp_query.

This is how I'm doing my rewrite:

function setup_rewrite_rules($wp_rewrite)
  {
   $custom_rules = array();

   $custom_rules["job-vacancies/company/?([0-9]{1,})/?$"] = // enable
company
   "index.php?post_type_index=1&post_type=job&company=" .
$wp_rewrite->preg_index(2);

   $wp_rewrite->rules = array_merge($custom_rules, $wp_rewrite->rules); //
merge existing rules with custom ones

   return $wp_rewrite;
  }
add_filter('generate_rewrite_rules',  'setup_rewrite_rules');

I originally thought something might be going wrong with the archive plugin,
however, I've tried all the ones I could find and they all result in the
same problem,
Plus, if I reset the post type to post so it uses the index.php template I
still lose track of the query var, so I think it must be me/the rewrite
rule!

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

Sorry this is long, just trying to be thorough!

I wouldn't overload the post_updated_messages filter. That filter is
designed to alter the existing post/page messages. If you want your own
message, then redirect with a query var you can grab, and use the
admin_notices action to drop in a notice.

The problem is that your rewrite rules are added after the page rewrite rule
(the most general one), so they don't have a chance to match your URL.

Yes, unfortunately, it does lie within the bounds of the GPL as long as they've done attribution right.

Are you sure the site is selling?

Translated the site from Spanish to English and it's just offering
BuddyPress as a free download.

Hi Scribu,

Not sure if you realised, but company isn't a taxonomy, it's a custom field.
Plus if I print out $wp_rewrite I have the structure shown below - my rule
is the first one so it should be matched first, and the general rules are at
the bottom.

So I don't think the order is the problem?

Excerpt of wp_rewrite inc all job-vacancies rules:


[job-vacancies/company/?([0-9]{1,})/?$] =>
index.php?post_type_index=1&post_type=job&company=$matches[2]
[job-vacancies/[^/]+/attachment/([^/]+)/?$] =>
index.php?attachment=$matches[1]
[job-vacancies/[^/]+/attachment/([^/]+)/trackback/?$] =>
index.php?attachment=$matches[1]&tb=1

[job-vacancies/[^/]+/attachment/([^/]+)/comment-page-([0-9]{1,})/?$] =>
index.php?attachment=$matches[1]&cpage=$matches[2]
[job-vacancies/([^/]+)/trackback/?$] => index.php?job=$matches[1]&tb=1

When you are going to download it, you have a SMS subscription code to
download.

And in a small part, at the end of the page, we can find how to download
from wordpress.org.

So sorry. They are doing money with the distribution and I don't think it's
good, but they offer the WordPress link to download without any fee.

Didn't realize.

It's not 'unfortunate': it's what allows people to make money from GPL
code.

There is no requirement for attribution with the GPL (there is with some of
the CC licenses, which are not as open and free as the GPL), only that
copyright notices are kept intact.

The website is selling a 'service' -- a virus checked version of the
software with a fast download!, and at the bottom of the
'send-an-SMS-to-pay-for-it' page, you can download the free un-virus-checked
version. I did, and can confirm that it is exactly the same as the version
you can get from wordpress.org (though one version behind the latest.)

They seem to be targeting the kind of 'customer' who would normally get
their 'free' software from a Warez site and regularly expect it to be a slow
download (if you don't pay) and a high probability of containing a virus.

*shrugs* nothing legally wrong here. Move on...

Thanks a lot for pointing out the admin_notices action, Andrew :)

Problem solved:

add_action( 'admin_notices', 'my_custom_post_type_admin_notices' );

function my_custom_post_type_admin_notices() {

	global $pagenow;

	if ( 'post.php' != $pagenow ) // Only show notice, if any, on the post edit screen
		return;

	if ( $post->post_type == 'my_custom_post_type' && isset( $_GET['message'] ) && $_GET['message'] == 'some_variable' )
		echo '<div class="error"><p><strong>Note: </strong> please provide some missing info</p></div>';
}

Shouldn't it be $matches[1] ?

A related strategy is to use the Transients API to store error data so you
can give more useful error messages without a huge _GET output. You can save
detailed error data into a short-lived transient, set your error message
flag, then when the page reloads with the editor your admin_notices hook
fetches the details from the transient, shows them, and deletes the
transient.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API

The plugin system and the errors built into the settings API both use this
strategy.

They're also offering a direct download link to buddypress.org if you want
to skip the SMS. This just appears to be a niche download.com-like site as
Mike said.

My Spanish is rusty (thankfully, Chrome helps me out) but I also don't even
see where they're selling anything. They're just letting the user know that
SMS can cost money in some situations. Again, *not* that selling it would be
a problem. It's not.

My Spanish is not rusty at all, and I can tell you that they are not selling buddypress. They have some strange SMS based verification process to give people access to their "guaranteed virus-free, high-speed download" of buddypress.

They charge people via the SMS required for that verification though - and charge differently based on the the country your in. Like someone said before - they are selling a download service more than buddypress itself. Its probably targeted at those who are less than internet-savvy, exploiting their otherwise healthy fear of viruses.

Sleazy, but legal.

Does the database structure stay fairly constant from version to version?
How common is there a structure change, and how often is that change major?

The reason why I am asking is that I am writing an API to allow access to my
wordpress posts.  To keep it lightweight I don't want to go load wordpress
but rather just query the database directly.  The downside to this obviously
I have to redo my queries if the wordpress table structure changes, hence
the question how common are such changes.

Thanks.

We take no responsibility for scripts breaking that decline to use the API.
:-)

On occasion we will add, alter or remove fields and indexes. (Most common
would be adding an index or altering a field.) We recently added the
wp_commentmeta table, in 2.9. I would not be surprised if links become a
post type and we drop wp_links soon. But we're not in the business of
reshuffling the entire schema. Your scripts are probably rather safe
considering that large-scale migrations on sites like WP.com are just a lot
to stomach. We actually avoided making a single schema change in 3.1, which
was a conscious effort.

You can find a history of changes on this page:
codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description.

Something that has always irked me about wordpress is how a Page Title 
is also the Page Link.

Does it make sense for Wordpress to have the three items
Page Titles,
Page Links,
Page Permalinks

OR

Page Title
Page Permalink
Name of Page Permalink

Instead of just the two
Page Links/Titles,
Page Permalinks


For example you might want to keep the link (as it would appear in the 
menu) nice and short to
"About"

Then when you click on the link "About" I would like the page title to 
be editable instead of just inheriting About, to be something like 
"About Johann Sebastian Bach"

Currently I do change most if not all of my sites to do this via hiding,

adding code etc.
I can't believe that I am the only one doing this.

Subject: [wp-hackers] is this a bug?
Message-ID: <4CE4F766.7000407@elfden.co.uk>

from bbPress plugin development.

$this->file           = __FILE__;
returns: E:\htdocs\wpbeta\wp-content\plugins\bbpress\bbpress.php

However:
$this->file =  WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/plugins/bbpress/bbpress.php';

returns: E:\htdocs\wpbeta/wp-content/plugins/bbpress/bbpress.php

Note the difference \wp-content as opposed to /wp-content

Now tracing this back I find this:
define('ABSPATH', dirname(dirname(__FILE__)).'/');


Normally this doesn't make a difference, but I think this is causing 
an issue within get_themes (line 437 of wp-includes/theme.php)

'Theme Root URI' => str_replace( WP_CONTENT_DIR, content_url(), 
$theme_root )

this fails as they don't match.

For reference on my linux hosted site it works fine, but locally on 
Win 7(I use easyphp) it has been failing to correctly point to the 
child theme within bbPress. So I realise this is an unusual setup.

Thoughts?

You might want to test what is happening by using PHP_EOL (which is 
dependent on host-OS) instead of /, and see what happens. If it works 
this might - indeed - be a bug.

I use the All in One SEO Pack on most of my sites to add meta content, and
that has a field "Menu Label" which allows you to specify a short name for
the navigation.

I think this is definitely plugin/custom field functionality, especially now
we have Custom Menus in WordPress

erm, silly question, but why? PHP_EOL deals with line breaks, \n etc

I'm sorry, must've been drunk earlier this morning, don't know where 
that came from. I obviously meant the DIRECTORY_SEPERATOR constant, not 
PHP_EOL. Again, sorry for the mix-up.

  ahh thanks, that makes more sense. Though your spelling was still 
off ;) DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR

but.. using it still doesn't help, guess I'll have to continue the hunt.

Hi everybody!

I was interested in checking out how the WordPress code flow works... When I
googled it, ( probably with the wrong keywrods), all I ended up was this;

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:DavidHouse/Wordpress_Code_Flow
<http://codex.wordpress.org/User:DavidHouse/Wordpress_Code_Flow>

which is an excellent shot at it but very very old thus worth nothing
today.

I also searched how the heck wp_head works, could not find it neither.

In order to understand wp from the ground up, I thoght I should get a full
grasp of from url to all the way to wp_footer() what really happens... Ant
pointers in this regard is highly appreciated.

Thanks

Agreed, custom fields are the answer. I wrote a simple plugin using a  
meta box and a custom field for my site. The function I use on all  
pages except for the post page looks something like this:

function front_page_title() {
	global $post;
	$title = get_post_meta($post->ID, 'front_page_title', TRUE);
	if ($title) {
		echo $title;
	} else {
		the_title();
	}
}

URL requested: the .htaccess rule sends to index.php and from here, 
include() by include() you can get a good grasp of the flow

2 interesting reads:
- the file wp-settings.php itself, which includes and sets up most thing, 
and
- http://codex.wordpress.org/Query_Overview which explains rather neatly 
how the translation from a URL to an SQL query occurs

In case you haven't considered it the obvious solution here is to use the
XML-RPC API in WordPress to access the posts. If you're trying to squeeze
out every last ounce of performance then running a XML-RPC library might be
just as resource-intensive as loading up WP, but it would be the most
schema-agnostic solution possible, since the XML-RPC API is less likely to
change than even the behavior of WP in relation to the posts table.

The problem is that it has to be used everywhere for it to be of any
benefit. It might be better however to just standardize on the '/' which is
used for the plugins and themes directory.

Yeah, can we blame Windows ;)

Currently I think all these would be affected for my set up:

$theme_loc = str_replace(WP_CONTENT_DIR, '', $theme_root);

$theme_roots[$stylesheet] = str_replace( WP_CONTENT_DIR, '', 
$theme_root );

'Theme Root URI' => str_replace( WP_CONTENT_DIR, content_url(), 
$theme_root ),

because of the difference:
E:\htdocs\wpbeta\wp-content
&
E:\htdocs\wpbeta/wp-content

Though obviously it is a fairly rare scenario, and will only crop up 
for someone using something like __FILE__ to identify their directory 
in the plugin.

Though shouldn't plugin authors be using WP_PLUGIN_DIR instead...

(which I will suggest is used).

The reason in which we're (or rather JJJ) is using __FILE__ to identify the 
directory in which the plugin is located is in relation to 
http://trac.bbpress.org/ticket/1333 which led to 
http://trac.bbpress.org/changeset/2566 so if you want to stick the plugin 
files into /top-secret-blah-blah-blah/ or just something different from like 
/forum/ you can. BuddyPress currently has /buddypress/ hardcoded, but who 
knows? Anyway, though I'd let you know about that Rich! :)

Is there a place where people can find out accurate information about
insecure plugins?  Because plugins are third-party, no one would expect the
core team to do anything about them.  However if I have installed a plugin
that is vulnerable to attack, I'd like to know about it.

Plus, plugin developers might not even know themselves that their plugin is
vulnerable and some might not even care to upgrade them when they do know.

How can I find out this information so I can then make an informed decision
on my plugins?

Thanks.

Best thing to do is notify the plug-in developer. Just because they
haven't noticed it's vulnerable doesn't mean they can't or won't patch
it. If they do refuse to patch it, patch it yourself. If just you're
wondering if your plug-in is vulnerable to attack check the same place
the hackers do security sites advisories and google.

Also, if a plugin has a known security problem and the original author
has abandoned it or is no longer interested in updating it or is
totally unreachable or what have you, and somebody is interested in
taking it over and patching it, then we can grant commit access to it
and allow it to be updated and maintained by somebody else.

This is a special case circumstance, but it is better to have actively
maintained plugins than to have old insecure plugins sitting around in
the repository.

Also if you can't get a quick response or can't work out how to get in contact with the plugin author please report the security issue to the core security alias and we can try and ensure it gets resolved.

Big client wants their own help documents that they can edit to create some

I should have guessed somebody was going to mention that.  But that's a
performace hit as you mentioned, albeit not a big one I bet but over
thousands of api calls it adds up.  Plus idk if xml-rpc would work I don't
just need posts access but post meta, comments, comment meta, users, user
meta as well.  Plus xml-rpc honestly seems too complicated for my users I
want just a simple rest api.

Reguardless it seems I shouldn't have to endure too much in the way of
database changes so I should be good.

Also like that disclaimer you started with Andrew, but I already figured
that much but is a good thing you said that to be clear on the expectation.

You could try a plugin such as Logout of Password Protected Posts [1]
and remind your users to log out if they're on a shared/public
computer.

You could combine that with a shorter expiration time for the cookie
(maybe an hour?).

Is there any other way to accomplish changing the expiration time for the cookie (preferably to 30 minutes or less)? Been searching for a solution, and I'd prefer not to hack core...

Thank you for your plugin hint, but this solution requires users action (they have to click "Logout" and they can forget).
The main purpose was disabling access (for example for public places).
Code from Andrew Nacin was great and simple solution, but it is not possible to leave comments now...
Maybe is there any simple hack for this?

Thank you...

Subject: [wp-hackers] Legacy URL WP_Rewrite
Message-ID: <E364B83AFCA34971B8E40A767923AFD4@ws01smn1>

I am building out a fairly large site in WP 3.0.1 and would like to import all of the legacy content from former CMS and preserve the old link structure.  It's fine to do it as a custom post type, but I am having a little bit of trouble setting up a WP_Rewrite and/or a permalink structure to match it.

The current linking structure is:

http://www.site.com/home/articles/article/100/12345/

Where the 100 is the post's category, and the 12345 is the post's ID.  I am totally good with making the 12345 the post's slug when we bring it into Wordpress, but I am having trouble with the fact that the category ID can vary -- always numeric, but could be 101, 102, 103, etc.

Essentially, that ID is redundent and not necessary, so I really just need to ignore it, but I am having trouble coming up with a WP_Rewrite rule and/or custom post type permalink structure code that will accomodate it. Since we aren't going to be adding posts to it, the default permalink for this post type can be /home/articles/article/100/(slug).

Any help or formulas would be awesome!

Hello:

I am planning on using WordPress 3.0 to power a small university website. I
am looking for a way to create a development environment that I can sync

Simplest way I suspect would be to MySQL replication which is pretty
well documented over at mysql.com

Just out of curiosity, what changes will you be making to the database  
that you'll need to be syncing back?

I don't know his specific reasons, but one reason *I* have would be to setup
a test environment with production data (posts, pages, categories) so I can
test new functionality against valid data.  Since his question is limited to
the DB (and not to files), I don't know what other use might be valid.

I certainly understand wanting to sync production data to the  
development site, but it sounds like he wants to sync his dev site  
back to his production site.

plugins and their settings would need to be exported to production? i 
know some themes have the ability to export and import options, but not 
sure about plugins.
perhaps they're creating custom post types in dev, and then they just 
need the new post type in production?

I'm running into similar issues as well.

if you don't want users creating new websites on the production site. I do
this quite often.

@Chris: I haven't found any plugins that work for me. I do database level
migrations and it works pretty smoothly.

We are going to need to sync the DB, templates and new plug-ins. The dev and
production sites will need to be exact copies of one another.

I do too, but not sooo smoothly, you have to use everytime the php to

Instead of using "time() - 31536000", try changing that to 0 (zero).

A zero for the time parameter will make the cookie into a session
cookie, which means that it will last only as long as the browser is
open. When the browser is closed, the cookie goes away.

@Chris: The thing I would worry about is if somebody posts or comments  
or makes changes to the production site while you're making changes on  
the dev site and then you overwrite.

That being said, I host my sites on WPEngine and the offer one-click  
staging sites. I don't know if they sync back to the live site or not,  
but it's worth shooting an e-mail to jason at wpengine.com to see what  
they're doing.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimJ-08q-bEeixPf33GUzE+65xLbkzobUwWCHXSC@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Before the header.php runs wp_head(), information such as the current
page's title can be outputted... How is this possible? I thought, wp
kicks in with the wp_head()!

Also, what file or function figures out whether the current page is a
single, category, tag, 404 etc.. Is that done before the ball is
passed to the theme? or is it done at .htaccss/web.config time?

Thx.

wp_head() defines a the hook used by plug-ins and themes to add information
to the header.  WordPress kicks in a long time before header.php is even
loaded.

When you visit a site, you're visiting the index.php file in the root, which
loads WordPress and processes the query.  Then WordPress loads the index.php
file for your theme and that file calls get_header() which loads header.php.
 You're already a long way down the pipe by now and have access to just
about everything and every function defined by WordPress.

WordPress decides what the current page is before picking the theme.  This
is when WordPress decides whether to call your theme's index.php (general
requests), single.php (individual posts), page.php (pages), etc.

Will:

Good point, I think I may have to insert some script in the wp-admin login
page that redirects the user to my development box. This would keep them
from loging in on production.

We are going to have to host this on our company web servers so wpengine may
not be an option.

Thanks,

Are you doing a Wordpress Multisite or Wordpress site? This helps to understand the difficulty of the task. 

I have released a few of our scripts for doing wp release engineering at Tribune. With Wordpress you have to build for production environment and sync back to dev, not push from dev to production. This is because Wordpress uses PHP serialization dumped straight in the database, it is not normalized. (And really stupid design.)

The easiest way to do this is to have your dev site answer as the production domain and use DNS or hosts entries on development machines to point to the dev site.

So for production server:

www.uni.edu at 123.1.1.1, in DNS

and dev box dev.uni.edu at 122.2.2.2.

You can just set the apache vhost to answer as both dev.uni.edu and www.uni.edu .

just add 122.2.2.2 www.uni.edu  to your hosts file and code away.

My preferred method going forward will probably be a Hudson + Capistrano way of deploying Wordpress. This may be overkill for you (a Java app using Ruby to deploy PHP). If anyone is interested, I may eventually put this in the Codex when the process is flushed out.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP Development & Production Sites
Message-ID: <3CDC16DC684343CAAC2EEB6F2E63075A@ws01smn1>

I have tried to do something similar in the past with having a separate 
admin instance from production instance.  In other words, a separate server, 
that is not accessible to the public (either by VPN or IP access list only) 
on a different website URL.

If we set up the site with a site_url and home_url as admin.site.com, and 
pointed to the production database it seems to have a few issues:

1) Images uploaded are always linked to the full URL 
(http://admin.site.com/wp-uploads/2010/11/foo.jpg)
2) GUIDs/permalinks become admin.site.com
3) Links within the site always link back to the bloginfo() configured 
website URL (www.site.com) in the production database.  Authors using the 
admin site will get bumped to the public site if they click any links inside 
of the site.
4) The option_siteurl and option_homeurl don't apply to bloginfo() links, so 
plugins/templates that try to use that will get the database URL 
(www.site.com).

I've tried, by using a hack-ish series of filters to remove the absolute 
URLs entirely from WP, so that everything is always only /wp-content, etc.

Is there a simpler approach that I am missing here?

Greg, 

Is there any reason why you can't use the WordPress URL structure now and set up 301 Redirects for the old URLs?  You'll be in for a lot less headaches down the road (the path of least resistance and all...)

All,

If a Theme defines both a "home.php" template file (for a custom "home" page

And then here's the relevant code from the template
loader<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/template-loader.php#L21>
:

21 if ( defined('WP_USE_THEMES') && WP_USE_THEMES ) :

         ) :

get_front_page_template()     ) :*
*27         elseif ( is_home()           && $template = get_home_template()
          ) :*
28         elseif ( is_attachment()     && $template =
get_attachment_template()     ) :
29                 remove_filter('the_content', 'prepend_attachment');
30         elseif ( is_single()         && $template = get_single_template()
        ) :
31         elseif ( is_page()           && $template = get_page_template()
        ) :
32         elseif ( is_category()       && $template =
get_category_template()       ) :
33         elseif ( is_tag()            && $template = get_tag_template()
         ) :
34         elseif ( is_author()         && $template = get_author_template()
        ) :
35         elseif ( is_date()           && $template = get_date_template()
        ) :
36         elseif ( is_archive()        && $template =
get_archive_template()        ) :
37         elseif ( is_comments_popup() && $template =
get_comments_popup_template() ) :
38         elseif ( is_paged()          && $template = get_paged_template()
         ) :
39         else :
40                 $template = get_index_template();
41         endif;
42         if ( $template = apply_filters( 'template_include', $template ) )
43                 include( $template );
44         return;
45 endif;

Is this the intended behavior? If so, it would seem to make the use of
"home.php" obsolete, since "front-page.php" covers both use cases.

(And sorry for the incredibly belated question. I know that "front-page.php"
has been around for a year. I've just never actually *used* it, so wasn't
aware of how it was defined/used by the template loader.)

Hi Chip,

this is the correct behavior.

Front-page is always the front page / first page, whereas home could be your
home / first page or whatever you defined to show your regular posts.
Therefore front-page.php will override home.php.

Thanks, Chris.

But, does that make sense?

If a Theme includes both template files "front-page.php" and "home.php", the
Blog index will display differently, depending on user settings:

If Blog (i.e. "posts") is set to display on the front page, then the Blog
index will use "front-page.php"; however, if the front page is set to
display a static Page, and the Blog set to display on a non-front Page, then
the Blog index will use "home.php".

That seems inconsistent (and confusing) to me:

1) Blog display will be different depending on location setting, rather than
by content type (Page vs Post)
2) "*home*.php" is potentially used for a non-home page.
3) "front-*page*.php" is used for both Pages and Posts.

I've not poked around Trac yet; does anyone know if any related tickets have
been opened? I think some of this needs some cleaning-up.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimuaYVN+341DGXXx7HDAgNQxnoSmrf=dkLFADVq@mail.gmail.com>

To follow up, here's what I'm thinking of submitting as a patch:

Replace is_home() with is_posts_index() - or is_posts() or is_blog_index()
or is_blog()
Replace home.php with posts.php - or posts-index.php or blog.php

Reasoning:

is_home() currently returns true under inconsistent circumstances (if Blog
posts are displayed other than on the front/home page), while
is_front_page() covers the relevant condition (both "posts" and "static
page", when on the front page). Thus, the only *unique* condition for which
is_home() returns true would be better named to reflect the true condition:
the blog/posts index, NOT "home" (i.e. the front page).

if both "front-page.php" and "home.php" exist, then for the only
circumstance in which "home.php" will ever be used is NOT on the home page.
Thus, the template file name should be changed to reflect the true
condition: the blog/posts index, NOT "home" (i.e. the front page).

So, two questions:

1) Is this reasonable to mark up as a patch and submit a Trac ticket, or is
it a waste of time?

2) Any preferences on the nomenclature? To me, "posts" and "blog" are
interchangeable; so I don't have a preference. My only thought is that using
"posts" would be more consistent with the similar use of "page" in Theme
template file nomenclature.

Seems as if you're mixing up front-page.php and front page template :)

The existence of a front-page.php will always enforce the use of this file
as entry page of your blog. A front page template is a template file with a
different name that is activated by creating a page using this template and
the according settings under wp-admin / settings / reading.

I'm not confusing the two, as far as I know.

Simple question: if "front-page.php" and "home.php" template files both
exist in a Theme, under what conditions will "home.php" be used on the
home/front page of the site using that Theme?

Yeah, that would work but then you would be stuck with a whole lot of
301's in your website. Perhaps with a bit of coding, on top of the 301
redirection, you could walk through all content and translate all old
URLs to their new counterparts?

Ok .. did a test:

If you have a standard installation without any special setting under
wp-admin / settings / reading:

Front-page.php will be used as your entry page. Home.php isn't used at all.

If you define a page as Front page and a page as Posts page under wp-admin /
settings / reading:

Front-page.php will be used for Front page and home.php for your Posts page.

Exactly!

So "home.php" ISN'T "home". It's simply the blog-index (posts-index),
whether on the front page or another page.

front-page.php and is_front_page() cover all of the uses of home.php and
is_home() for both posts-index-as-home and static-page-as-home - which is
why I'm suggesting to rename "home.php" and "is_home()" to something more
accurate.

Make sense, or am I still off-base?

That depends on how you define "home". ;)

The home.php is a (deprecated) override for the index.php file. We
used it before we had the ability to set your own Page as the first
page. No theme should contain a home.php any more, IMO, since you can
now define any Page as the first page.

The front-page.php is the overall override for the first page of the
site, period. It's always the front page, if it exists.

(Not asking sarcastically) is there a logical way to define "home" other
than "front page"?

That is, "home" is whatever shows up by default for the domain:
www.domain.tld: whatever displays is "home".

And if that's the case, then is there really a (logical) use anymore for
"is_home()"? When a site is set to show blog posts on the front page, then
the front-page blog index is "home", and "is_front_page()" is true. But if a
site is set to show a static page on the front page, then blog posts are on
a non-"home" page, but "is_home()" is true in this condition.

(My only concern is that $wp_query->is_home is rather embedded in query.php.
Doing a proper replacement becomes non-trivial.)

"Home", as defined by a lot of people, is whatever the main posts page
is. Agree or disagree, but that's the definition.

Too much legacy to change it unless you simply remove it entirely and
break tons of stuff that assumes it to be the case.

(Just for my own edification; I'm still new to most of this) isn't that the
whole point of *deprecation*?

It wouldn't be the first (or most impactful) change-by-deprecation in
WordPress. :)

There are a frackin' LOT of themes using is_home().

If you want to argue for breaking them all, hey, on your own head be it. ;)

True.

But by the same token: how many Themes were using "get_header()",
"get_footer()", and "comments_template()" without supplying the template
files? That was deprecated several releases prior to 3.0, in which legacy
Theme support was finally removed. The same could be done for "is_home()"
and "home.php", right?

No argument here. All this got hashed out back around 2.1, I doubt
anybody's looked at it since.

BTW, we already have $wp_query->is_posts_page. You can use that to
figure out where the main posts are. It doesn't have a function call
for it though.

"$wp_query->is_posts_*page*"?

ay de mi! oy vey!

This whole posts-vs-pages nomenclature maybe should have been thought out a
bit more thoroughly...

In what sense is home.php "deprecated"?  It's the first template file
searched for by get_home_template().

Also, being able to set the front page doesn't take away from the
purpose of home.php, which is to provide a template for the posts
landing page, which might be distinct from the front page.  The
home.php template if perfectly legitimate as a place to show the
posts' landing page.  Otherwise, if you have separate home and front
pages, one has to specifically assign a page template to the "home"
page.  The home.php template saves users that extra step.

Not sure what is wrong with that.  That is what 301s are for.  Over time there will be less and less traffic coming in over those URLs and more coming in over the new URLs.  Google and others will adjust accordingly.

Hmm.  That's what I was suggesting, I think....

Okay, so "deprecated" was probably a bad choice of term. Unnecessary,
perhaps, since index.php serves all the same functions as well as
being a backup to every other page as well. There's nothing you can do
with a home.php that you can't do without it, usually more cleanly.
Home.php is more or less a remnant from when we didn't have the option
to make a Page on the Front of the site.

BTW, Page Templates don't work for Posts set to be on Page urls.

Sometimes unnecessary, but sometimes helpful.  It's quite possible
that you would want to be able to generate unique markup for the home
page without having that same template be used as the fallback for
singular post objects, whether they be posts or pages or something
else.  It can make things simpler.  And the home.php template is
closer in purpose to a category template than a singular template,
because it deals with objects in the aggregate.

Strictly speaking only style.css and index.php are "necessary."
Please be careful about saying things like  "home.php is deprecated"
to the theme reviewers. :-)

> There's nothing you can do

I don't think of extra logic branches in index.php as being
particularly clean, but I'll admit that's more a matter of taste.

> BTW, Page Templates don't work for Posts set to be on Page urls.

You're right.  That smells like a bug.

Not a bug. Expected consequence of the Template Hierarchy. It doesn't
load page templates for the main posts page because you wouldn't
expect it to do so. On the other hand, it does load the Page Template
for the front page, when you have a Page set to be the front page.
Templates apply to the content (i.e, the post) , not the URL it
resides on.

The style.css has this at top;

/*
Theme name: The Theme
*/



<quote>And without this, WordPress won't recognize the theme as a
theme, and that in turn means you won't be able to activate it.
</quote>
This quote is from the Smashing Magazine's Book Beyond the Blog by
Thord Daniel Hedengren ( page 58 ) - which is excellent book by the
way.

I find it odd to think that it is the style sheet that tells WP what
the theme is. Aren't all themes have one and only one style.css (that
is /wp-content/themes/aTheme/style.css), and every theme's name is
always the name of the containing folder. Why do we need this ( Theme
name: The Theme ) at the top of style.css one wonders....

Why does WordPress need to grab what the theme is from the style sheet?

Wouldn't scanning thru the folder names under the /themes give the same result?

I'm not saying/suggestion, the current way is bad or anything. I'm
just trying to understand why the choice was made that way. Why do we

One relatively recent phenomenon -- a theme's parent is designated in
its style.css.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

ie.

Template: twentyten

It'd hard to imagine how the directory structure could do this without
creating a jumble of sub-folders, isn't it?

There is more then just the theme name being pulled from the style.css, 
there's the author, the author uri, theme URI and other information that the 
wordpress.org repository uses in displaying information along with the child 
theme's designation as Bill pointed out and tags, etc.. etc.. description

The first Hook that WordPress kicks into gear at is 'init'. If you are
trying to catch something at it's earliest point 'init' is the place to be.

Not true. There are a few others before 'init', including
'plugins_loaded' (this is handy as it's the very earliest hook
available to plugins) and 'setup_theme' among a few others.

However, the 'init' hook is the earliest hook at which the entire
WordPress environment and all its functions are available. So if your
plugin is trying to catch something at its earliest point then, yes,
'init' is usually the one to go for, but not always.

Haluk, http://codex.wordpress.org/Query_Overview is also worth a read
if you're interested in how and when WordPress does what it does.

*Init*, as Chris mentioned, is the first hook WordPress fires, but there are
many things that can't be accessed that early. In particular, the
conditional tags (is_home(), etc) aren't populated at that point. If you
need to hook early but also want access to the conditionals, the *wp* hook
is a better choice. Really, it's a matter of what you're trying to do and
how much information you need, so be sure to experiment with both to see
what information you have access to at what point.

A theme named 'My Awesome Theme' will be in a directory named
something like 'my-awesome-theme' or just 'awesome', so this is not
always the case.

Not *exactly* true. "init" is the first hook that many people (should) use by no means the first one to fire, see:

http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/307/

I'm only mentioning this in case people who need earlier hooks assume there are none before "init."

Message-ID: <AANLkTimjdb3zSV4_K9h+kheM1+M-eU4PRdwxTpKiE0Hu@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I've just seen the announcement that WP 3.1 beta has hit WP.com users.
Wohoo!

The new feature I liked the most is Internal Linking.

However, I feel it's unfair that such a feature is available only in Rich
Text Editor mode, as those of us who use the HTML editor instead are the
same WordPress users with the same needs of easily linking to past posts.

Would it be possible to offer the same feature in HTML editor more? It could
be as widget like the Post Tags widget in the Add New Post page. If it can
offer a search of tags used in the blog, then a similar widget can also
offer the same feature of searching for past posts based on keywords and
then easily link to it with a click or two.

What do you guys think?

All the best,

You can have multiple copies of the same theme at the moment, which is
nice.

Not too smart choices in the past I guess. See also

Perhaps you never noticed before, but the HTML editor never had the same 
functionality as the Visual editor. The HTML editor uses the basic 
browser dialog intentionally, as people using the HTML window have made 
a choice to write in code, not using a WYSIWYG. There are a number of 
handy features in teh Visual editor to make composition easier, like the 
styles dropdown and formatting options that are not built into the HTML 
editor, since that's meant to be the DIY view.

If we started putting all the RTE features into the HTML editor, there 
would be a huge backlash. If you want the WYSIWYG features, then you 
might as well just use the Visual editor, at least for now. Maybe 
someone will write a plugin to do what you ask, though.

While I agree in principle with what you've said, I disagree with the
implication that Internal Linking is a WYSIWYG feature. It's not. It's a
content cross-referencing feature that is Visual/HTML-editor agnostic.

So, I have to agree with the OP, that providing the Internal Linking feature
in the HTML editor is appropriate (though, perhaps Plugin territory?).

Points are well taken. I'm not really after the handiness of WYSIWYG, but
rather the Internal Linking feature in the HTML editor.

I have a strong feeling a plugin will come up to do just that. :D

I still thin it wouldn't belong in the HTML editor. That said, there is 
an analogous example: embedding media files. In the Visual editor, there 
is a button for image insertion in the WYSIWYG toolbar. In the HTML 
editor, there is a button to create an img tag. However, both have 
access to the fuller-featured media uploader that is accessed by 
clicking the icons ABOVE the actual editor toolbars. If we want to 
create parity in the Visual/HTML experiences, then the answer probably 
should be to put linking on the same level as inserting media files at 
some point, rather than hijacking the HTML editor's URL entry popup.

Now that's a pretty neat idea!

(By the way, does the new internal-linking feature save the internal links
in an import-export friendly manner, or are they absolute URLs?)

Looks like it just generates an absolute URL based on the post you select.

Now that's the best solution. It would mean one less plugin to worry about.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Multiple published statuses
Message-ID: <AANLkTindrJsJMwsTW1CUkrHqo4QmNwPjec3gRqrLcUN=@mail.gmail.com>

I haven't fully tested 3.1 yet, so I don't know if custom statuses are
live yet (a quick google turned up nothing). If they are, how do I
register one, and is it possible to create multiple public statuses?
That is to say, I could have the default published status but also an
updated status, for example, that acts as a published post but has a
slightly different property. I dunno it this would be useful to many
people, but I can definitely see a use case for this sort of
functionality at least on my site. Some of this could be accomplished
with the new custom post formats but they don't really help with
organization, since it doesn't appear you can filter by a post format.

Indeed, I should have been clearer. *Init* is the first general purpose
hook, in my opinion, unless you're trying to modify some very specific and
low-level WordPress behavior (such as plugin loading, localization, etc) or
are trying to change some aspect of the loading process.

The reference Mike provided is definitely a useful one when determining
which hook to use.

There are no custom post formats. Post formats are nothing more than a
taxonomy, which sounds like what you're looking for here, and would be best
to leverage.

Custom post statuses are currently weak and stiff. You can add them, and as
long as their public property is set to true, then they can be queried the
same as a published post. I would use a taxonomy, versus trying to go the
status route.

register_post_status was added in 3.0.0 and only supports one status per "post"

Indeed. Is there any reason why this wasn't done with a shortcode? A
hardcoded link doesn't help when you

- move a page
- change a post's permalink
- change your permalink structure
- move a site

and probably more I can't think of right now. 

Can somebody point me to the source, so that I can check if there is a
filter that can be used to produce a shortcode?

No please, don't add a shortcode, it would make the page generation 
process even heavier!

I think a internal-link shortcode plugin would be a great idea! Something
like:

[internal-link $Post->ID] or [internal-link $Page->ID] would be awesome! If
the shortcode could be generated from the new internal linking UI dialogue,
even better!

Have you actually done any of those? Because other than domain name
changes, WordPress handles all those cases just fine, and uses 301
redirects to shift you over to the new URLs when necessary.

A shortcode was not used. There are no plans to ever use a shortcode here.

This has been previously discussed on wp-hackers. I am pretty sure I
responded to the thread with the reasoning.

I'd like to search the entire plugin repo [1] for a string to find out
how many plugins are using a particular hook. Previously I've
attempted to check out the entire repository but it's proved simply
too big, and even if I did I'm sure grepping it would then give me
more headaches.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I might go about this? Does
anyone have a checked out copy of the entire repo that they could grep
for me?

Should have clarified there; In order to search for uses of a filter
or an action you need to search for the term wrapped in single quotes
and in double quotes, otherwise it ends up matching function names,
CSS class names, variable names etc too. Unfortunately Google doesn't
work in this case.

Email me directly with what you want and I'll do the search for you on the checkout I have of every plugin trunk

I'm slowly working on a tool for this

Aside from the Query Overview article which will probably help you a good
way to get a sense of the flow is through the various action hooks. If you
look at the order in which they occur then you get a sense of what WP is
doing, and if you're curious about a specific part it's usually easy to find
the action hook in the source and see what's happening around it (though
often the relevant functions don't have good descriptions so you have to
parse all the PHP logic before you really understand it).

You can read the action order on the codex
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference

You can also use a plugin like 'Suspect' which gives a list of all actions
in the the order they fired:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/suspect/(suspect is also a good
way to see what queries wp is performing, and a
contender for best WP-Tuner (RIP) replacement).

You can also use the following code in a plugin or functions.php to echo out
the name of each action as it fires, so you can see how the flow of actions
relates to whatever it is that you're working on:

/**
 * Debug system to echo out every hook name as it fires
 */
function gv_debug_print_every_hook() {
    echo "<br />";
    echo current_filter();
}
add_action('all', 'gv_debug_print_every_hook');

Hi, Frank,

Thanks for the hint!

Hi Dion, no worries about basic, I am still a learner :)

Here is the output:

array(2) { [0]=> string(7) "canread" ["singleseat"]=> string(1) "1" }
array(1) { [0]=> string(10) "singleseat" }

Thanks for looking at this.

Scribu I'm bummed to hear you asking a leading question like that. I think
its clear that most sites will have some kind of sliding scale of importance
v. risk that they use to decide which plugins are worth it. Core WP needs to
assess each need and decide whether its fit for inclusion in core. Implying
that everything should be a plugin because some things have to be plugins is
not a good way to deal with feature requests.

Also: Super Cache, as has been constantly debated and pointed out, is a
particularly poignant example of functionality that by all rights
*should*be included in core but which isn't because it's too complex
and
server-dependent to be appropriate. Lots of people want caching in WP but
when faced with the realities and complexities we all agree that it should
stay plugins to save everyone extra headaches.

Compared to caching this proposal for a non-UI API for registering custom
fields is a perfect example of some functionality that should be carefully
considered for inclusion in core because its so simple, obvious and
appropriate. Not only would many theme and custom-plugin developers use the
functions in their implementations but public-plugin developers could use
the new API in their GUI plugins, standardizing the process and making those
plugins more future-proof than ever.

Unlike caching there aren't many good reasons to avoid this idea. Do you
know of any?

IMHO pointing out that there are already plugins that accomplish something
is not a reason not to put it in core, it is a reason to consider it even
harder! If the test for inclusion in core is "Are there already popular
plugins that do this job, proving that there is user desire?" then a custom
fields API is something that has had enough proof of its value since WP 1.5.

Hi all,

I am playing around with 3.0 and the new menu system. I love it but I
have noticed it doesn't play well with the existing menu management
features.

Forgive me if this has been brought up before. On the page editor
screen if you select a parent page from the drop down this is not
respected by the new menus interface and vice versa. I understand why
(what with categories and custom post types etc), but shouldn't the
old ways of managing the menus be hidden if the new way is activated?
Maybe something that happens when a theme is activated that declares
support for the new menu system?

I can just imagine users banging their heads against the wall trying
to edit the menu from the page editor. Telling them, 'oh I know those
controls are still there, but they don't work, use the other instead'
isn't going to cut it. Its opening the door for unnecessary confusion.

Even better I think would be if some way could be found to handle menu
management *both* on the page editor screen and using the new
interface. It makes sense from a usability viewpoint that you would be
able to assign the page to a menu and a location within that menu when
creating the page without having to go to a separate interface to do
it. But it also makes sense to be able to edit menus en masse from one
location.? I think if we can have the ideal solution we need both
options.

Just my 2 cents please don't flame!

Ash

Great point, Ash!? I completely agree with all the points you raise, and
would like to add one of my own, though mine is really more of a feature
request.

It would be great if you could set the top level pages for a menu, and then
tell it to automatically drill-down through child pages as well, rather than
having to manually create the entire multi-tiered menu structure and then
also maintain that.? Also, it's slightly misleading that the default
behaviour for Twenty Ten if you add pages but no menu, is to fallback to
wp_page_menu and output a nice multi-tiered menu... but then when you create
a menu of top-level pages only, this automatic behaviour disappears.? Like
Ash said, I understand why, I just think it's counter-intuitive.

At the moment, while I applaud the effort that has gone into menus for WP
3.0, I wouldn't consider them to be production-ready and there's a lot of
work left to be done.

Cheers,
Japh

as far as i can make out, presently the menu is static and completely
separate from the general logic of the site. all other features work
as is. this helps in making custom menus and IMHO it would be cool to
have intelligent menu features like the ones u stated but we should
not treat it like a bug but as an enhancement...

I don't think anyone is trying to say that these are bugs. The menu system,
as is, works perfectly.

However, parts of it are a bit unintuitive, especially when considering
training a client.

I agree with Japh that if I setup a top-level menu it would be nice to *have
the option* to tell the menu to auto-populate the children (and keep them
updated when a new child is created).
The user could still go to the menu page and use the nice drag and drop
interface to remove or add items... but the basic structure would be
populated automatically.

Again, I don't think these are bugs, but I do agree that whilst the efforts
of the WP team on the menu system are awesome, and that it is perfect for
smaller custom menus, when it comes to the main navigation on a large
page-heavy site, it currently doesn't cut the mustard in terms of features
and intuitiveness.

At the end of the day, we sell Wordpress to our clients because it's
easy-to-use, because they don't have to do things manually, so I'm going to
continue using wp_list_pages, and the PageMash and Page Links Manager
plugins to manage main navigation.

Just my 2p

Eris

You can still get a pretty good idea with Google by putting add_action 
or add_filter into the search like this:
http://www.google.com/search?q=site:plugins.svn.wordpress.org+%22add_action+wp_head%22

Instead of triplicating the category structure, I would consider using an
additional taxonomy to organize your content.

why use a parent/child relationship.

As I understand it:

cat 1
	cat a
	cat b
	cat c
cat 2
	cat a
	cat b
	cat c
cat 3
	cat a
	cat b
	cat c

is there a special reason to assign it this way?
Why not simple cat a and cat 3. It would simplify the process immensely.

The admin hacks you guys are talking about make my head spin.

I can't help thinking the problem is how you're approaching your needs. I
don't think that synching your dev environment back to live on the database
level is the right way to keep them in sync. The content lives in the
database and you should never mess with the live content. If you change
content on your dev setup you should manually re-do that work on the live
site. This is not that hard and has the positive side effect of avoiding
your development cruft form living on the live site (e.g. crap added by
plugins you tried but didn't keep).

What you really want to sync back to the live site are two things: 1)
plugin/theme files and 2) Plugin/theme configuration options.

In my experience both of these can be solved with files rather than the
database, and if you can keep everything in files then SVN can do all the
dirty work for you. You commit the changes on dev and just update live.

The tricky part is getting configuration into files rather than the
database. My approach to this is a system where I have an array in
functions.php containing all the get_option() values that I want/expect the
site to have, and an 'init' callback that checks the values for those
options and runs update_option() to change them if they are wrong. This way
when I make a change on the dev site I just need to add an element to my
array to reference the specific option I changed, commit that change to SVN,
then SVN-update on the live site and it immediately changes the value. This
way you don't have to worry, you know what the value will be on any site
with an up-to-date version of the functions.php or plugin file. In my case
this also has a positive side-effect of making it impossible to change the
setting in the admin, it gets reverted immediately when the page reloads
(and shows an error message so the user isn't confused).

Another less-invasive method is to have 'versions' of your
plugin/functions.php and to make incremental changes to settings. So to
update the live site you add a new version to your plugin/theme and have an
upgrade method that changes the settings the way you think will be necessary
for that particular transition. This system lets users change things after
if you want that but IMHO it is more complicated then what I described above
because in any given scenario you aren't completely sure what the resulting
settings will be.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikPOy_SeKeNRnR-MF6YH-LCp1JV+cS0gAFP5bZ4@mail.gmail.com>

When you want to add a new plugin to your system, what do you do to check it
out for it's safety and security on your blog?  I'm in charge of a ms
instance at a University and I get requests for plugins all the time,
especially for ones that are on version <1 or admit they're "alpha" or
"beta" versions.  I don't want to simply reject something because of it's
label, but I'm not totally sure how to evaluate a new plugin.  Do any of you
put them on a test server and then point a vulnerability scanner at the new
plugin to see what happens?  Advice?

Thanks.

Read every line of code
Test it works.
Check it doesn't kill your db servers.

I use multiple tests:

   1. Install it on a test server to make sure that it actually works with
   the version of WordPress it claims
   2. Point a basic vulnerability scanner at the system (here's one called
   WordPress Scanner: http://blogsecurity.net/wordpress/tools/wp-scanner)
   3. Pull the source down and do a quick sanity check

Step 3 is actually more valuable to me than step 2.  Even if a plug-in
"works" and doesn't raise any red flags, it could still be doing something
you don't want to your system.  You can make sure the plug-in doesn't add
unnecessary database tables, doesn't email your sensitive information to 3rd
parties, escapes user input before processing database queries, etc.

So make sure the plug-in works as advertised, then do a quick walkthrough of
the code to make sure it's not doing anything funky.  Any steps beyond that
just add to the security of your system, but might make it harder to
maintain things as new versions come out or as new plug-ins are requested.

My simple method of evaluation of any plugin is to see the related forum
post(s). This will give you immediate information if its working or mostly
not working for others.

Following from that you can do what Peter mention "read every line of code"
and run it in some kind of realistic environment to production.

I started a plugin certification program where I go through the plugin on 
request for security / code issues
http://frumph.net/plugin-certification/

If the plugin passes i'll post it's version and thats it's good to use 
without consequences, if I find issues in the code I email the author with 
the problems, checking for deprecated functions, security issues with 
posting(_get/_post/_server/_request) and whether or not it uses nonces 
properly on option screens including deprecated function use.

The reason for this is that there are too many plugins to go through every 
one of them on the repository but if I do it by request it's a lot easier 
for me to handle.

..of course i've only done a couple so far and the author's havent gotten 
back to me yet ;/ but thats how that goes.

One suggestion for the plugin directory -- put the onus on plugin
developers to state whether or not their plugin creates additional
database tables, and other things. They could list the hooks they use,
for example.

It could be a short checklist that is displayed alongside the existing
plugin info in the plugin directory.

Having this info would help you decide whether a plugin is worth it --
and it would help you troubleshoot problems if they occur.

Would be helpful for other developers and admins yes, but some plug-ins use
a *lot* of hooks and filters.  Creating a list would be needlessly
time-consuming.  When we get down to that, it's just an extra step for
admins and researchers who care to actually crack open the plug-in and look
at in-line documentation.

what if there was a plugin that could backup the settings you've set from
one site (say a dev site) and import them to another site (say your
production site).  Now I am not aware of any way currently to where a plugin
can know what settings another plugin makes, but you could have a txt file
with a list of option names like

setting1
setting2
ect

Go though the db and get_option for each of those, save it out to a file
like

setting1:value1
setting2:value2
ect

Import that generated file into the production site that would step though
that file line by line and update_option to move all settings from one site
to another.

I always thought it might be nice to extend the WPXML import/xml to
include WP settings, especially plugin settings.

I believe they call that an SQL dump.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Phasing out use of wp_die() for comment errors
Message-ID: <AANLkTimLvHV5dv8HTxVa4v3uSzjRa1tN26MPPzOE0=qL@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to see what people think about replacing wp_die() for comment
errors with something a bit more graceful.

Here are the three potential errors that can occur when a comment is posted:

 * Missing required fields
 * Duplicate comment detected
 * Posting comments too quickly

These are currently handled by wp_die(). This isn't a user friendly
experience as it stops the user dead in their tracks and by default
they have to use browser navigation to return to where they were.

It is possible to override the wp_die_handler function so themes can
make this a little more user friendly, but it's still not great. What
would be ideal would be to return the user to the page they came from
(in most cases the post permalink) and show a helpful error message
within context.

What are people's thoughts on how we could go about phasing out using
wp_die() in this situation? I'm thinking it would be something that a
theme would add support for. For example:

add_theme_support( 'error-handlers');

That might need a better name, but you get the idea. The theme would
then handle displaying errors (at the top of the page in a big yellow
box, for example).

Two ways this could be done:

 1. Redirect the browser back to the post permalink with an error code
query var appended which maps to a list of predefined, filterable
error messages (much like the 'message' query var used in the admin
area).
 2. Instead of using 'wp-comments-post.php' for the comment form
action, we could switch to using the post permalink (the form for
password protected posts uses this). This would allow us to continue
execution and use the $_POST data to repopulate the comment form
fields when required fields were missing.

I had a look through Trac to see if anything to do with wp_die() had
been discussed recently, but didn't spot anything.

Thoughts?

that would get everything, even settings from plugins the user may no longer

That does sound much better way to handle comment form errors, I personally
like #2 on your suggestions I think its a clean and user friendly way to
handle this.

I would prefer a method that allows the ability to override the behaviors of
wp-comments-post.php through filters, actions, and by way of a function that
also takes arguments. This way wp_die() remains, and control over
wp-comments-post.php is added without having to manually change the file.

I would support option #2. This is more like how most sites handle incorrect

I've found an article here:
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/1482/restricting-users-to-view-only-media-library-items-they-have-uploaded/4412#4412


But I don't know where to put this code:
____________________

add_action('pre_get_posts','users_own_attachments');
function users_own_attachments( $wp_query_obj ) {

    global $current_user, $pagenow;

    if( !is_a( $current_user, 'WP_User') )
        return;

    if( 'upload.php' != $pagenow )
        return;

    if( !current_user_can('delete_pages') )
        $wp_query_obj->set('author', $current_user->id );

    return;
}

Anybody an idea?
This would be of great help for me.

Thanks in advance,

Arthur

Message-ID: <AANLkTikNTa=aFCdMfB3U_yGe38Z=tgTTG2nBQZkP_42c@mail.gmail.com>

Case:

With our current web site ( which we want to move to WP in the near
future), we ended up having 1000's of images which we've uploaded and
categorized over the years. These images were managed thru our
home-made cms which I wrote in ASP.

At the time of each upload, we've used a form asking the uploader what
the image is all about in terms of keywords, what category/folder it
will be stored in etc etc... At the time of upload, our DLL also
calculated the width and height, what's the type of the file ( gif,
jpg) etc as well.

Usually, we found those images thru simple google image search and
uploaded them and used them at the time of creating an article/post.
So on the go type of development... But sometimes, images were
specially created by our graphics deparment guys and were the
certerpieces of the whole article itself.

And from time to time, when we wanted to use any of those images, we
did a search in our database either by category or by keywords, and
then select the URL's of those images found in the search results.
This way we were able to use those images in our posts.

Now we want to move to WordPress.

Obvioulsy, we do not want to re-upload those images one by one using
wp admin route. Any road map ideas? That's challenge #1.

And challenge #2, as far as I see, I cannot group/categorize those
images. images can only be tagged, there is no way on media
upload/gallery sections in the admin interface to see the existing
groups/categories that those uploaded fiels are in. Am I correct? Is
this how it is with WordPress? I appreciate it if you toss some tips
in dealing with this.

You can either paste it into functions.php, which is in your theme
directory, or you can put it in a plugin - just look at any other plugin to
see the format you need to follow.

You can register a custom taxonomy for attachments, and I think there is a
filter for displaying the terms in the single attachment editor screen.
Also, on the list screen, you can register a custom column.

Taking this one step further the plugin repo could automatically scan
plugins when they are committed/updated and make a list of internal
code/hooks they use. I wouldn't know where to start but I imagine this would
be possible with PHP. It could present an automated list of things the
plugin does, something like:

* Actions used: init, wp, pre_get_posts, wp_head
* Filters used: the_posts, get_permalink
* Uses options api for storage
* Use transients api for storage
* Performs custom SQL statements // i.e. uses $wpdb->query or
$wpdb->get_results etc.
* Alters database using API // i.e. dbdelta() or whatever that system is
* Uses HTTP api
* Creates custom post type: "bananas"

etc.

Obviously it would be a lot of work to make it completely exthaustive, but
as an admin of network sites I would always look at such a list and consider
it if it was available. If nothing else it would give you a starting point
for diving into the code, like "wtf is it using custom SQL for, this plugin
shouldn't need that", then you can look for $wpdb and see what the queries
are so you can consider whether they are worth it.

Seeing GOOD APIs it's using would also be valuable. Any plugin taking
advantage of the HTTP api and Transients api is already a head above the
rest in my books. It shows that the dev is familar with WP and you are less
likely to deal with bugs caused by re-inventing the wheel.

Alternately this could be a plugin which does such evaluations of other
plugins on the same WordPress installation. If this exists already someone
please post a link :D

I'd love to see something done with this to make it a little more user-friendly.

Option #2 would work for me, and we could even just by default set the
commenter cookies which most themes (including the new built in
comment_form() function) use to prefill the form (after filtering the
values through kses or something like that).

Were you thinking that if a theme didn't add_theme_support() then it'd
still just fall back to the wp_die() approach?

I think the first step is to do this for themes using comment_form() in a way that other themes can adopt easily

@scribu

Thank you on this; http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-from-server/

But is it possible to achieve my original task completely avoiding a
web interface and doing it the following way;

1- Copy and paste the files ( the thousands of files [images] from the
current server's uploads folder ) into wp-uploads
2- Then write a script ( I'm most confortable with ASP) to read the
meta data of those images from our current CMS>SQL table to port/map
it into WordPress tables.

This method would require programming but it is OK with me.

To pull this off, first part requires no expertise as it is as simple
as copying one folder from one location into another. ( since the
current wp-uploads folder is currently empty, there is no issues of
overwriting any file, a simple copy-paste will do the job in a matter
of an hour or so. )

Second part would require the knowledge of what happens when a file is
uploaded into wp as to which table(s) and field(s) get modified. I
just need to map data from the current SQL.


But to take care of the grouping, I guess I'm gonna have to look into
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/media-tags/ plug in which was
suggested by Paul. But since I do not know the inner-workings of this
particular plug-in in the way how he manages the media-tag portion, I
don't know if it would be worthwhile to spend time in it.

@Paul

Thank you for your suggestion. In your opinion, do you think I can
create those media-tags programmatically? It looks like I can use the
media-tags as folder names. Assume my current images folder on the old
server has sub folders as people, animals, plants, then I would just
add people as a media-tag correct. And to pull the pictures such as
Obama, I'd type then Obama since that info would be stored in
"caption" or "title" in the wp-uploads table.

@all

Currently my images are grouped in folders. Does wp-uploads folder
store all images in one layer or does it support folder's in there as
well? In other words, will I be able to have
wp-uploads/old-server-images/people
wp-uploads/old-server-images/animals
wp-uploads/old-server-images/plants ?

I think that should be possible without too much hassle. It won't be a 
perfect solution and probably a solution that breaks in the future, but 
as a script for one transfer that should work.

I think, you should create a test database and compare a database dump 
from before and after an image upload. Also do that with the Media Tags 
plugin. This way you should see what traces the upload of a single 
images leaves in the database. You could then write a script to just 
insert your files in the database, based on the information from the old 
system.

WordPress either stores all files in the same folder or groups them by 
year and month. You can decide which way to use on the media options 
page. I'm not sure that it's worth keeping any special structure for 
your imported images, as new ones most likely won't adhere to any other 
folder structure.

Of course, there could be a plugin which allows you to define another 
folder structure for uploads. I'm just not aware of any current plugin 
that does that. Also, the question is if it is relevant in which folder 
the file is stored, as long as the media page allows you to filter by tag.

Regards,
Johannes

The Media-tags plugin I wrote sets up a Taxonomy in WordPress. This taxonomy will function like Post Tags where you can assign one or more 'tags' to a media attachment item. The plugin is just an interface to the WordPress Taxonomy system. One note on the Media-Tags plugin. Again as I just mentioned the Media 'tags' are tags. Which means they do not support hierarchy like the category taxonomy.

Yes, this is very easily done using standard WP functions. Look into wp_insert_attachment http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_insert_attachment
Once you have the attachment ID then you can assign tags to the item. For this look into http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_set_object_terms

In the wp_set_object_terms function the third argument is the taxonomy name. If you choose to use my Media-Tags plugin then this should be set to 'media-tags'. If not then you will need to register your own taxonomy. Which is dead simple using the WP function register_taxonomy http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy

I don't think by default WP supports folder grouping form images. But there might be some plugins for this.

I like this idea and have always found the wp_die() approach pretty awkward.
We already depend on themes to show the 'awaiting moderation' message, so
the proposed changes should be integrated with that (and/or that message can
be integrated into a new better system).

Here is a related trac ticket about filling out the WP_Error() system to be
more generalized and more useful in all scenarios, including showing errors
on the frontend of a site:

Also, do a complete forensic analysis of the operating system. WordPress
is a popular target for spammers, but not necessarily the attack vector.

If you can install some watcher that checks md5sums of files. Use that
information to find new modifications and analyze those hosts.

Message-ID: <C7052083-51EC-4CA5-8BBC-D6A215066A66@ur.ua.edu>

Hey guys,

I'm using the get_user_meta function to grab the wp_capabilities of a user, but in some cases it's returning an empty string instead of an array.

Here's how I'm using the function:  get_user_meta( $current_user->ID, 'wp_capabilities', true );

Depending on the server, a successful response is something like array(1) { ["administrator"]=> string(1) "1" } or array(1) { ["administrator"]=> bool(true) }.  However, the cases where it fails returns this string(0) "".

According to the Codex, it should at least return the value I'm looking for.  What would cause get_user_meta to return an empty string?

Thanks,

I think the behavior is correct. You tell the server that you want to get a single value, that's why you get an empty string when nothing matching your criteria can be returned instead of an array.

Never underestimate the power of posting.  The problem ended up being that someone using a different $table_prefix other than "wp_" wouldn't have the meta_key "wp_capabilities".

Let me know if I'm jumping to conclusions here, but I'm able to reproduce the error.

That would only happen if you change the table prefix *after* WP is
installed.

To clarify, the capability key is generated based on the table prefix. This
allows users to have different capabilities on different sites in a
MultiSite environment.

Also, you should probably be using get_userdata() instead.

Either way, the fix is to grab the global $table_prefix.

Can you explain why get_userdata is better than get_user_meta?  I don't mind switching, but it would be helpful to know the difference.

Actually, if you know the user ID, you'd be better off just using the
WP_User object.

$user = new WP_User($id);

That will retrieve the properties of the user and create an object
with it. However, it also goes and fetches their capabilities for the
current blog as well. You can then use the functionality of the user
object to check for specific capabilities. For example:

if ($user->has_cap('edit_users')) ...

If you just want to see all that user's capabilities, then you can
look at the allcaps array:

var_dump($user->allcaps);

Simple. Works.

Oh, and BTW, the global $current_user is already an instance of the
WP_User, for the current user. So if you're talking about the current
user, then you can either just use that global directly, or do this if
you don't like using globals (I don't):

$user = wp_get_current_user();

If you want to check a capability for a user other than the current one,
there's a new user_can() function coming in WP 3.1 which you can use.

To be honest, all I'm really interested in is the named role of the current user, which get_user_meta or get_userdata return.

Good to know there's more than one way to achieve the same goal.  It'd be great if there was some resource out there that says "this function is faster for getting XX.  If you're looking to get YY, use this other function ZZ."  Doesn't sound too practical, considering all of the things a particular function can do but that's sorta what you and scribu are describing.

I agree with Jeremy on this. There is a TDWTF article where everyone tried
to find the best solution to keeping one's hands warm while riding
a bicycle. Now, everyone had really great ideas, including pumping warm
water in from a mechanism attached to the pedals which would warm the water
through friction or something powered by the pedaling.

The point is, "Gloves." And one shouldn't forget that.

The second point is WTF? are you doing combining Development with
Production? That is like running on thin ice, naked, and wondering why
you're dead several moments later.

The point of Development and Production is to keep them separate and if that
is not the case, then you are doing something wrong. The point of
development is testing. Once that is achieved, then you move over to
production.

I think the thing most people want is a simple way to develop/test some settings of a plugin and then be able to migrate those over to production, easily. 

Sometimes, you want to take a live site and test a plugin with it, so you want the latest data to go from live to staging/dev. 
This can and should be done with a simple export -> import, but individual plugin settings aren't exported, and sometimes a
plugin/widget that's on the live site is not exported either. 

A full blown SQL dump of prod -> stage is the next option, which works, but by the time you get done testing your new plugin/widget/theme settings you have new comments on the blog, you have new posts on the blog, and doing another db dump -> prod is not the ideal situation. 

People are just trying to find one simple solution to export those settings, as opposed to every plugin/theme having it's own export option. perhaps we just do a mysqldump of the options table? I dunno.

The 2010's header.php has this ( <!DOCTYPE html> ) as the first thing.

If I remove this or comment it out, what are the harms? How important
is it to keep it?

I'm trying to experiment resizing iframes dynamically. So far, dode
seems to work on all major browsers.

But with one caveat;

If I leave the header.php unchanged ( keep it with <!DOCTYPE html>
that is), except IE, all works.
If I lremove it, then IE too works.

IE 7.0

I don't mind removing it unless there are issues I should know of
before going down on that track.

The Doctype html is because TwentyTen is in html5. I wasn't aware of any problems in IE, but changing it might cause problems down the road when utilizing html5 elements.

contextual_help filters?

WPEngine has a "staging" environment set up for their clients. Don't ask 
me how it works but its possible.

I don't believe that script will do any good in this case, he's working with iframes, the html5 shiv allows IE to style new html5 elements

However I would also think not having a valid doctype would cause other problems for IE

This is more a HTML question than a WordPress question, as it's
independent of WordPress.

That said, having a DOCTYPE in the document forces the browser into
standards mode. Without this, the browser will render in quirks mode,
which for IE is the equivalent of IE 5.5.

Most likely, your problem could be solved in a different way (using the
aforementioned html5shiv, or IE9.js), enabling you to keep standards mode.

Fair warning: By failing to use the API here, and instead relying on
get_user_meta(), you're guaranteeing that your code will be broken in a
future release of WordPress.

This code MUST be fixed to comply with the GPL licence.

Can I ask how is this code non-free? Did they steal the code from you?
Otherwise how do you know it's non-free? I can't see anything that is
obviously non GPL complaint. (I am just being nosey)

Also if there is no explicit license it's GPL v2.

Please, you know, just read the license once.

What license? I can't see any license in that trunk what so ever. I
seen a refrence to the LGPL license which I believe is GPLv2
compatible. Am I missing something, if so can you point it out?

I think Ralf (from the subject) and Ncolas (from the quote above) are trying
to say the code looks obfuscated and is thus not compliant.

However, I think that the author just got the line endings screwed.
If you search and replace {four or more spaces} with <newline>+{those
spaces}, the files look quite normal, not even vaguely obfuscated.

I don't think so, if there is no licence, copyright applies.
There is no occurrence of licence in the code, headers, nor in the readme.

The only reference of (L)GPL are those of the libraries :
ui.tabs.js, colorpicker.js, class.smtp.php, colorpicker.js, 
class.phpmailer.php, jquery.validate.min.js
AFAIK, those with a pure-GPL licence can not be used by non free code.

The code is non-free :
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#section1
The ?source code? for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.

Code without indentation is not really _my_ preferred form of reading.

You're right
sed "s/\([[:blank:]]\{4,\}\|\\x09\)/\n\1/ig" mee_newsletter.php
seems to output correct code.

In doubt I would say it was not voluntary.
(I will reply on the plugin google-group, but I guess a licence should 
be present anyway)

sorry for the noise and thanks for the comments

Ah forgot about the title and that one word makes everything else make
sense. Cheers. Yea I have to agree that code isn't obfuscated.

If you look at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/ You will see
clause 5 of the requirements being if no license is specified it is
GPLv2.

You are claiming that because it doesn't fill your preference of how
source code should be laid out, it's non-free? Well using that logic
code that has { } on separate lines is non-free because it's not my
preference to have it laid out. Since I am not a lawyer I am not sure
but not having new lines in your code doesn't seem like a GPL breaker
and the line you seem to be focused on seems to be explanatory and not
a clause.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Change the login url in the lost password e-mail?
Message-ID: <4CEE3878.5040107@favola.dk>

Hey WP-hackers,

I've encoutered a minor issue with my Wordpress site. When a user 
requests a new password via. the lost password form, Wordpress e-mails 
the user with a new password. In the same mail, Wordpress inserts a URL 
(http://yoursite.com/wp-login.php). Since there is no "?redirect=" 
appended, the user is redirected to the WP admin area. Is it possible to 
append a redirect URL to the link Wordpress inserts into the mail or 
some other way to change which url the user is redirected to?

I've tried looking through the Action/Filter reference and I even tried 
the filter "lostpassword_url" but without any luck.

Does any of you have an idea, solution or a suggestion that might would 
fix my problem?

In advance, thank you! :)

Only the *copyright holder* can specify the license of a copyrighted work.
So, if no license is specified, then *there is no license*.

(It's the reason that Themes submitted for inclusion in the Theme Repository
are required to declare their license.)

Not being a lawyer I am not sure and high chance I am very wrong. But
aren't those requirements like a legal requirement for using it and by
using the svn hosting you have subsequently agreed to there for that
clause would affected the licensing of and copyrighting of public
domain items such the plugin previously discussed? If not then can
that clause be removed to remove confusion?

That statement isn't legally binding.

The most obvious reason is the utter lack of
privity<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privity>.
For example, that statement is found
here<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/>,
but the request for SVN access is on a completely different
page<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add/>.
I suppose there must be a legally binding way for WPORG to claim a
non-exclusive right to distribute all repository-hosted code under GPL
(which is essentially what they are attempting to claim with that
statement), but the current setup certainly doesn't suffice.

The copyright holder did specify the license. They did it by uploading
it to the repository without an explicit license attached.

The plugin is assumed to be GPLv2 when it lacks a specific
declaration. This is because the author (and copyright holder) of the
plugin took affirmative action to not only submit it for inclusion but
also to upload it to the repository using SVN. Given that the
requirements are known, this action makes it implicitly  licensed, and
as it states on http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/, the lack
of a stated license makes it GPLv2.

You *can* declare a license on a work through an implicit action. You
do not need to specify it outright. Look at the Terms and Conditions
for many different sites, for example. Usually they contain a clause
to the effect of "you grant us a perpetual, non-revocable, license to
publish any material you submit to the service in whatever media we
choose" or similar. This is a *license*, and by using the service, you
agree to the terms. Yes, you retain copyright to your work, but the
act of submitting it somewhere can indeed put a license on it.

We require explicit licensing in the themes directory not because it's
necessary, but because we want to make theme authors aware of
licensing and what it means.


BTW, the plugin in question is not obfuscated, that's just newline idiocy.

Meaningless. Sites all over the web have their terms and conditions of
use on separate pages.

Thank you for your opinion, however, I must point out that this is
only your opinion. Until it's backed up by a legal authority, it's
meaningless. Mine too, I will add. ;)

No. The failure to specify the license is what causes WPORG to *claim*
certain rights, primarily, the right to redistribute the code under the
terms of GPLv2.

If the copyright holder, for whatever reason, disagreed with that claim, he
could very easily get a court to rule in his favor. (Not that it would
matter; to my knowledge, if such a person were to request to WPORG that the
code be removed from SVN entirely, that request would be granted, anyway.)

But *assuming* a license is not the same as being *granted* that license.

You likewise cannot *assume* that "the requirements are known" to the
copyright holder - especially for the reason that I pointed out already. The
SVN request page *does not include the requirements*, and does not require
any affirmative action on the part of the copyright holder that submitting
that form is in any way tied to acceptance of the "requirements". Likewise
for SVN-commit access.

There's nothing legally binding in any of this.

I'm not saying that it *couldn't* be done in a legally-binding way (in fact,
I'm sure it can - and in fact, I think it *should* be). I'm just saying that
the way it's implemented currently, it's not legally binding.

Indeed such sites exist, with such terms and conditions. But they do so in a
way that is entirely different from what WPORG does with Plugins. WPORG
doesn't even contain even a semblance of the above-stated clause. WPORG
doesn't claim that the site has a particular license, it claims that the
copyrighted code is "explicitly" a certain license.

But, I would treat explicit licensing of third-party code as a necessity. It
is beneficial to copyright holders and end users alike, because it
eliminates the possibility of ambiguity or confusion for all parties.

What matters here is not so much *copyright* law, as it is *contract* law,
as the transaction between WPORG and the Plugin developer (copyright holder)
is a *contractual* relationship. Thus, if there is no privity, there is no
contract. And with no contract, nothing that WPORG claims is legally
binding.

Yes, and none of them is analogous to Plugin submission to WPORG.

Of course, if you stepped back, and took the time to realize that our
objective here is the same (ensuring that WPORG has a legally enforceable
right to distribute repository-hosted code under a GPL-compatible license),
perhaps you would be less dismissive about my point.

At the most basic level, I've pointed out that a Plugin developer can get to
the Plugin upload page directly
<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add/>(i.e. without ever
navigating to/through the page that includes the
"requirements" and the license claim). Once SVN-commit access is granted,
connecting to SVN does not include any statement or verification regarding
acceptance of any terms or conditions.

Thus, *WPORG cannot prove* that a Plugin developer has read, understood, or
agreed to the stated "requirements" or license claim. If that cannot be
proven, then privity has not been established. Without privity, the contract
is invalid. And without a valid contract, the "requirements" and license
claim are not legally binding.

Now, IANAL, so I couldn't say with any certainty what *would* meet the legal
standard. I'm pretty sure that what would qualify in the US very possibly
would *not* qualify in the EU (which, IIRC, does not look too kindly on
"click-through" license agreements).

But, at least add a "I have read and agreed to the Terms and Conditions"
checkbox to the Plugin add-request form. If SVN allows for a MOD, add a
message that says something like "by committing code to the WPORG SVN, you
indicate your acceptance of the Terms and Conditions here: [url]"

But just putting the statement "If you don?t specify a v2-compatible
license, what you check in is explicitly GPLv2." (which is semantically
incorrect to begin with; it should say "implicitly" rather than
"explicitly") on an arbitrary page on the WPORG site doesn't cut it.

The reason I got into this was to leverage my asp programming skills
right into wordpress/php realm. I know it is long shot but when all
you get is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

When writing a post, right within the WYSIWYG editor, I go <script
src='/library/runasp.js'></script><script
runasp("/myasppage.asp","")</script>

And then boom, when you look at the post, right where I mentioned
runasp("/myASPpage.asp",""), i get an iframe with no scroll bars
regardless of how short or tall the output coming from that asp page,
basically a perfectly sized iframe. Since there are no borders and
scroll bars, I can do whatever I want to do in the myasp.asp page and
the reader won't know a difference. That's a very convenient trick for
me to get going.

Of course, this trick has nothing to do with ASP per se. This is a
general iframe resizing matter which opens up some wordpress
hack/extension possibilities for the rest of us. When I do <script
runasp("/myPHPpage.php","")</script> or <script
runasp("/myHTMpage.htm","")</script>, the code still works, regardless
of how many times I use the trick within a given post.

It's a shame IE spoils the whole experience.

I think some of the js calls I use do not work with IE properly.

Message-ID: <1FD82FAF-082A-4EF9-B42E-7A8FEE74CD11@codehooligans.com>

Happy Thanksgiving to all.

I'm trying to prepare one of my plugins for the upcoming WP 3.1 release. As everyone working on that codebase is aware the various list tables now use the WP_List_Table base class. I have some questions which for some reason are escaping me. 

1. I can add the new column(s). From that I can tell this filter has not changed. I can also add the sortable columns. But this is two different filters. Is there a method to add the column and mark it sortable all in one step?

2. I have the added and sortable column. But when I click on my new column header to sort the entire column blanks out. Looking for some AJAX hook I guess but just not seeing this. Any pointers would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
P-

Is this because functions are deprecated so much (even though get_user_meta has already replaced the deprecated get_usermeta)?

Like I said before, I don't mind switching my methods for the right reasons as long as I get WHY.

Thanks for the input, everyone.

Not at all, get_user_meta isn't going anywhere. We rarely deprecate
functions (100 of 4,000 over 7 years), and even when we do so, they
typically remain functional.

However, you're using get_user_meta to fetch internals. What you're doing
isn't much different from a direct SQL call. There's a reason why there's
another layer of abstraction for the roles/capabilities system (as well as
many other APIs) -- so you can use it.

We're very likely to change how roles and capabilities are stored in the
database in a future release, perhaps 3.2 or 3.3. If you continue to use
WP_Role, WP_Roles, WP_User, and related (proper) functions, nothing will
break. If you go straight to the database, I pretty much guarantee your code
will break.

For what it's worth, some sites do not store role definitions in the
database. One more reason to use the API.

After examining the WP_User object, I have a small correction to Otto's code from earlier.

It should be $user->roles, not $user->role.

$user = new WP_User($id);
var_dump($user->roles);

No, there isn't, and probably won't be.

You have to show us the code in order to figure out what's going on.

Ok. Thought I would ask.

I just figured this out. Always happen after one posts to the list. The answer revealed itself. D'OH!

Wouldn't this work?

if ( is_user_logged_in() ) {
     wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location => 'logged-in-menu' ) );
} else {
     wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location => 'logged-out-menu' ) );
}

For pages, just replace is_user_logged_in() with is_page( $pageid ).

hi

I am setting up the Custom Headers admin page as used in the twenty ten
theme on another theme.  I need to remove some of the options from the Admin
screen.  It seems everything on that screen is hard coded in
/wp-admin/custom-header.php.   For example, this will be a WP multisite
installation.  We want users to choose one of the custom headers that will
be displayed on the custom header page, and not have the option to upload
their own file.  There are no classes or ID's in the code in the areas I
need to remove display of.

Any advice on a good way to accomplish this?

thank you

Everyone keeps talking about a db dump...

My problem with this solution is that is you always have to find/replace all
the url instances in the db. 
Because of the slightly stupid way WordPress stores it url's 

That's also why a db replication doesn't work!

Message-ID: <751C4B99-6B4E-42CC-8C71-02282D959CD2@gmail.com>

Hi!

I'm using a setup on my development machine where the core of wordpress is checked out directly from SVN and WP_CONTENT is re-routed to a local repository. I did as described here http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing/Updating_WordPress_with_Subversion

Since WordPress released 3.1beta yesterday I thought that I could just svn switch to the new version on my development machine. But there's no tag for it. How do I get the beta from the svn? The trunk might seem the right place to look at, but I'm not too sure about that.

Thanks,
Martin

WordPress 3.1 development is in trunk.

The Beta 1 build was built from this revision: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/16587

You will want to keep updated as fixes come in.

A number of people have offered solutions to this already.

WordPress doesn't store it's urls in a stupid way rather it stores them in a way which is designed to provide the best performance on front end and feed views.

It isn't hard to setup a staging and development environment either using the same db as production or a different one.

For a complex site you are going to have to work against the real db to have any chance of testing reliably without duplicating your production environment completely which would likely be prohibitively costly for the little benefit it would bring.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Export
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=SdVd87XxvG2q+e+pgF2SoMs+KAOicqe6nvMp+@mail.gmail.com>

I've been in the throes of a large WordPress migration this past month.
 Seventeen individual WordPress sites are migrating to a single WP 3.0.1
network installation.  At the moment, several users have separate accounts
(logins) on each site - I'm moving them to a network to enable network-wide
login and better control over similar sites that are all running custom
child themes of K2 with similar set of plug-ins.  It's just easier to
maintain the network than the separate sites.

Unfortunately, my workflow is not the most efficient, but I can't think of a
better way to do it:


   1. Set up the new Site on the network
   2. Export posts, pages, and taxonomies from the existing site
   3. Import into the new Site
   4. Manually re-enter links
   5. Manually transfer reading, writing, permalink settings
   6. Activate plug-ins on the new Site that I was using on the old
   standalone installation
   7. Install/Activate any plug-ins that were missing
   8. Download the old theme via FTP
   9. Upload the theme to the new Site via FTP
   10. Export the wp_users table from the old site in phpMyAdmin
      - Delete any entries for users that already exist on the new Site
      - Run the SQL INSERT statement on the new Site's wp_X_users table
   11. From the network user management panel, use the Edit link to manually
   assign the new users to their roles for the new Site
   12. Set up the Site to use its proper domain with the MU Domain Mapping
   plug-in
   13. Point the domain at the appropriate folder on the server (with Media
   Temple, I just set a symlink for the folder)

Is there a faster/easier way to do this?  With a relatively empty site with
2-3 users this can be pretty easy.  More complex sites (lots of posts, 90+
users, etc) can take over an hour to transfer.  Frequently, some images will
break (not all of them convert from /wp-content/uploads/ to /files/ on
import) and I have to step through the broken posts myself.

What I would really like is a "clone site" button in Multisite which would
go out, retrieve the content, images, and *settings* from the old site and
automatically set up the new one.  Pulling in existing user accounts would
be awesome, too.  Sending out 100+ "please reset your password" messages is
a massive drawback when selling clients on moving to multisite, and right
now doing the SQL export/import is the only way I can think to transfer user
accounts and hashed passwords.

So, is there a better way?

Appologies if you are already aware of this but when using staging/dev
environments it is vital that you take advantage of the wp-config.php
constants that control the core site urls:

define('WP_SITEURL', 'http://localhost:8888/wp-svn');
define('WP_HOME', 'http://localhost:8888/wp-svn');

http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#WordPress_address_.28URL.29

These won't change the urls of media links inserted in posts, but it saves
you having to find/replace the main urls in wp_options, and in my experience
dev copies work totally fine once you start using them. As long as you are
online the media files still load fine from the live site, and all wp-admin
and post links lead to the right place on your dev install.

>> Because of the slightly stupid way WordPress stores it url's

It would be nice if WordPress stored its URLs without the protocol and domain.

ie. as

/web/files/2010/10/Picture-12.png

rather than

http://somedomain.com/web/files/2010/10/Picture-12.png

Aside from making it easier to move blogs from one server to another,
this would help where you might need a single page to be served via
SSL, for example.

If that can not be done... To help with that specific problem (SSL vs
non-SSL), the URLs could be stored as this, which is better than the
way they're stored now.

//somedomain.com/web/files/2010/10/Picture-12.png

This way, the protocol of the calling page is used by the browser to
pull in the photo.

I'd vote for offering options for storing the URLs, but having
sensible defaults. I am not sure storing the whole, fully-qualified
URL is the most sensible?

In my experience, no plugin provides enough settings to warrant simply
redoing the changes on the other site. Most of what is described appears to
take longer than simply manually entering in the settings onto the live
site. So much so, that I've never even thought, "You know I spend so much
time configuring plugins that it would be great if I could automatically do
so." If I did, then I would have already developed something that did just
that. However, it would have probably taken far longer than all of the time
I spent manually entering the settings.

It appeared from the initial replies that people wanted to write posts on
their local and have them show up on their production as well. There are
several problems with this. If the version is different, then there will be
scheme differences which might prevent some queries from executing or some
connections not forming correctly. If both versions are the same, then
setting the database to that of the live and then setting the wp-config.php
constants WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME to the localhost would allow for exactly
that.

I probably didn't say so, but it is true that the "right" way to do
something and the quickest, easiest, and laziest way to do something is
rarely the same. There are probably also a 100 different ways to implement
this as well. I was simply pointing out that the best method would be that
were you keep both development and production completely separate to
minimize completely the chance of headache.

Why not export and import them too?

You can get the links of any site as an OPML file by going to
example.com/site/wp-links-opml.php. The "Blogroll" importer accepts
this format for importing them. You can even give it the URL directly
and will import them directly from the other site.

I never understood why feeds are brought up as an argument against relative
URLs.

The content as well as any other URL related attributes can be filtered just
as well for both HTML and RSS.

Sadly, I don't think it's part of the RSS spec, is it?

I didn't mean to suggest it would be a simple switch to use relative
URLs. But, perhaps they could be used where appropriate.

Keep in mind that the export/import has been rewritten for 3.1, see

Personally, I wouldn't ever tough the pre-3.1 version again :-\

If you're going to filter everything, then you're adding a lot of
processing time and overhead, aren't you?

Look, I don't like shortcodes as is. As I see it, the content in the
database should stand alone, without anything that requires
post-processing in order to make it have a format viewable by the
reader. I should be able to just splat the thing out there and still
have it readable and proper. The content should be capable of being
displayed in any medium and still be at least interpretable, if not
displayed correctly.

However, we must have markup of some kind, because content often does
have formatting. HTML is a relatively good way to do markup, because
it can be parsed by whole lots of different things as is, without any
need to do any server-side processing.

So I see the need for shortcodes, in that they allow plugins to
arbitrarily modify content in specific user-specified places. I avoid
them as much as possible, but they serve a purpose. However, they do
affect that basic purity of the content. Now you have content that is
no longer independent of the site itself. This is a bad thing, it
breaks that vague separation of presentation and content barrier.

Regarding links, relative links have the same problem. They're
relative to the presentation. They're relative to the location.
They're not fixed. They make things harder when you change the format
of the site because they change along with it. Your content now has a
dependency based on where the content is being viewed.

Absolute links don't have this problem. They're absolute. They're not
supposed to change. If you have to change them, then you're either
doing some kind of extreme re-working of the whole site, or you're
doing something wrong.

So that's my basic thought process here. You're corrupting your
content by making it incapable of standing alone, and this sets you up
for problems down the road. And if you're frequently having to do
things like change your links to fit with content you're moving from
site to site, then you're doing the whole thing wrong in the first
place.

If you want to setup a local installation and have real content on
there, edit the HOSTS file. Make yoursite.com appear to be at
127.0.0.1. Then you can have your test site use the actual real URLs.
When you move the content, it will still have those actual real URLs.
If editing HOSTS files is too onerous for you, use a program to
automate it, so you can switch between a dev hosts file and a live one
by clicking a button. There's several programs that can do this out
there.

I use this exact process for making changes to wordpress.org. We have
sandboxes for the whole site. I can make any changes I like on my
sandbox, and when I go to wordpress.org in my browser, it goes to my
sandbox instead. Nobody sees my changes but me, because I have my
hosts file pointing wordpress.org to my sandbox. When I want to switch
it back to live, I click a button, hit refresh, and now I'm on live.
Easy. Works great.

That's exactly what I do, actually. I thought there was a special reason why
feeds would be affected by relative URLs.

Anyway, thanks for sharing your thoughts.

Well, unless you convert them to absolute URLs in the feed, then links
won't work, images won't display, etc.

Hi Steve,

If I understand what you are asking you want to modify the "Header" screen in the admin something like this?:

http://mikeschinkel.com/websnaps/skitched-20101126-214332.png

Assuming I understood then yes, you've found that the admin often does not have CSS classes to allow you to hide things and there are frequently no hooks available to modify what you want to modify. I'm not sure why nobody has thought to add CSS classes yet but as for hooks I think it's simply a case of hooks are added when someone takes the effort to ask for them and supply a patch on trac and, at least with the admin, there haven't been many people to do so.  So it is what it is.  

If you need a hook then best thing would be for you to suggest a hook and include a patch and maybe in next version it'll be there for both you and all the others who may need it in the future.

Of course that doesn't solve your (or others) immediate needs. Lately I've also had numerous client requirements to modify similar things in the admin so I developed a simple plugin I called  "Admin Parse Output" to enable me to hook the HTML output of the admin from my functions.php file and make any text substitutes that I might need.  

Here's the "Admin Parse Output" plugin:

https://gist.github.com/717514

This approach can be very fragile and is no substitute for proper hooks, to be sure but if you have no other option at least you can get what you need working. It uses the PHP output buffer which is why I created a plugin rather than just putting into functions.php; I've found that if too many plugins use the output buffer they can result in conflicts so having one that offers a parse hook eliminates my need to use multiple ob_start/ob_end_clean() pairs.

Anyway, here's code you can put into your theme's functions.php file (also here: https://gist.github.com/717515):

add_action('admin_parse_output', 'yoursite_admin_parse_output');
function yoursite_admin_parse_output($html) {
	global $pagenow;
	if ($pagenow=='themes.php' && isset($_GET['page']) && $_GET['page']=='custom-header') {
		$msg = '<p>' . __( 'If you don&lsquo;t want to upload your own image, you can use one of these cool headers.' ) . '</p>';
		$html = str_replace($msg,'',$html);
		$html = str_replace(__( 'Default Images' ),__( 'Available Images' ),$html);
		$html = preg_replace('#<tr valign="top">\s*<th scope="row">'.__('Upload Image').'</th>(.*)?</td>\s*</tr>#Us','',$html);
	}
	return $html;
}

If you need it to work slightly differently change what you search for and replace with when calling str_replace() and/or preg_replace().  

Hope this helps.

-Mike

P.S. Here's an answer I wrote on WordPress Answers when I first started doing this. While the technique I described above it more evolved this post might help too:  http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/2384/#2392

P.P.S.  Actually, this hook might make a nice addition to WordPress itself as a "catchall" for those things that there are not already hooks for?  Having it in core would eliminate the need for a plugin to use the output buffer directly and thus minimize issues of compatibility which is why there might be a benefit to having it in core.

I don't really get the ERS argument.  Would it be so bad to have wp prepend
the siteurl constant before the path from the database.

In 3.1, you'll be able to do remove_theme_support( 'custom-header-uploads'
);

You could consider extending the Custom_Image_Header class rather than
modifying the admin output. That's incredibly fragile, and it makes kittens
cry for it to be recommended, especially with such detail. With enough
effort, it would also have been possible to A) hide the upload form through
CSS and some PHP, and B) block custom uploads (as hiding the HTML isn't
necessarily enough) with a little PHP.

You forgot to quote the part where I said "This approach can be very fragile and is no substitute for proper hooks, to be sure but if you have no other option at least you can get what you need working."  Without that quote it makes my reply look like, well, that I was *recommended* it instead of suggesting it was a consolation prize for when there is no other option.  

Have a little more courtesy, please.

If I understand what you are asking then here's some code to show you how. Basically is removed the menu option from the global $submenu array:

Since a picture is worth a 1000 words, this might help you understand the code a bit better:

I agree,  All I would really like is one filter that is called everytime any call to the DB that returns a string with the site URL is called.

If people are worried about site performance in their feeds, they can ignore the action, but it would make my life 100% easier.

We can not explain to our customers how to change their host file and have many sites that are constantly being developed and have a production, staging and multiple development versions.
Even better would be to allow for two paths.  One for static items, (JS,CSS,IMGs) etc, and one for .php files.   This would make the use of a CDN much easier.
Let us hard code them into our config files, so that the same config file can be used for each site and every plugin maker can use these paths for their plugins.

Currently, I am having to rewrite the majority of plugins used on my big sites to force them to load their images and JS from my CDN.  The various plugins for this task are either too resource intensive or have to manually configured for each file.   

By default the static and active file URL can be the same, but for those that need it, this would be a huge improvement.

I have looked for a filter that I can reliably call, but could not find one.

thanks,

Andrew

The (slim) counter argument to this of course, is that you're corrupting
your content with absolute URLs, that are also subject to change.

Taking your 'average' WordPress use-case, relative URLs would be more
than adequate, as the content will be used within the main WordPress
instance. RSS feeds being the exception of course - but the exception
being the place that the extra leg work required makes the most sense. 

I do of course see Otto's very valid point, that the content should be
able to stand-alone. In my personal preference, stand-alone content
shouldn't have the absolute domain - as then it's tied to that domain,
and that domain only. True stand-alone content should work no matter
what the domain.

URLs should never be changed. That's the whole point.

Yes, under extreme circumstances, URLs will change. These
circumstances should be a) extreme, b) rare, and c) carefully planned
out in advance.

If you're changing URLs on a regular basis, then you're doing it wrong.

I'm sorry, so what's the URL supposed to be in development, staging, and production? and how are clients who don't know how to right click, supposed to get to the staging url? 

I agree this has been discussed to death on this list, but the lack of an official "this is how we recommend you go from dev -> stage -> prod" page, keeps getting people confused and making their own home grown solutions.

Dare I point out (again on this issue), that the 'average' WordPress
use-case is the hundreds, thousands, or if you are lucky millions of hits
day in and day out, on both your html pages and RSS feeds. *Not* the
once-in-a-lifetime (if that, for most sites) transition from dev to live, or
from server 1 to server 2 that has to be managed by dev anyway.

Why burden those millions of hits with a calculation every time? There is
enough processing of the content going on already without adding to that.

As a developer, yes, this is an issue one comes across regularly. But it is
a transitory issue (when you move from dev to live, occasionally when you
update your test/dev rig from live) but per site it is very rare. Whereas
the translation of relative URLs in RSS feeds, and wherever else they are
needed should not have to occur on *every* hit, which is what you are all
proposing.

It's really simple.

You can either teach them how to point urls at different servers - which isn't that hard.

Or.

Add output buffering and rewriting to dev/staging to rewrite the urls and make dev/staging believe they live at the real address for the purposes of url insertion.

The database can always reflect the real site address for even when in dev/staging however it is accessed.

Just to point out, both sides are "right."  

For most WordPress users who have blogs it's crazy to have the overhead and most people never need to change those URLs.

For the small number of people percentage wise who are using WordPress to develop websites whose budgets usually exceed US$5k and frequently exceed US$50k, this is a total PITA especially when sites are deployed sometimes more than once per day.

Both sides have opposing needs.  Unfortunately with WordPress as it is, only one side wins. And that side is the former. So learn to live with it  (unless and until a better answer comes along.)

-Mike

So tell them to go to http://stage.clientname.com/ and let them navigate around that site? Then what happens when we push to production? There is a configuration setting that needs to be changed to point all content to the production url (www.clientname.com) ?

can you point me to a blog post pointing to how to do that? 


Here is what I'm doing..

wp-config.php includes an "autopress.php" file, which has the following settings, WP_HOME, and WP_SITEURL,
so all the links on the staging server can point to the right url automatically. The problem is when a client uses the staging environment to seed the content before they go live with a redesign, or a migration to WordPress. 

Then all the images that are uploaded, and all the references to said images point to stage.clientname.com.. 

To address this issue, currently I just go through a checklist, and one of the items in it is to do a mysqldump from stage
and then run: 

find . -type f -name "*" -exec sed -i 's/stage.clientname.com/productionurl/g' {} \;

This addresses some of the lazy theme developers I've run into who hard coded things as well, copy the files to production, and then load the db. 

Am I correct in thinking you're suggesting a plugin for staging environment, that knows the site is currently in dev mode, and thus rewrites all image urls to the browser in dev mode, but store everything in the db as if it was production? (this way the plugin doesn't need to be active in production, and thus reducing the need for another conditional check?)..

One could technically make the argument that this environment could be in production as well, if the opcode cache is enabled, this value shouldn't need to be computed on every page load.. kinda like how symfony/ror and other heavier frameworks handle different environments..

Okay, let's say your production site is live.example.com and your
staging site is stage.example.com.

On your staging site, you set it up to think it's the live site, with
the live URL. This is to make it identical in content and database and
such with the live site.

Then, in some file that is not going to the live site (wp-config, any
plugin, etc), you'd do something sorta like this:

ob_start('my_callback');
function my_callback($out) {
  return str_replace('live.example.com', 'stage.example.com', $out);
}

Output buffering. It's easy.

You can use get_users(), with no arguments, coupled with some capability
checks, if necessary.

Is there a timeline for when plugins hosted at wordpress.org can opt-in to

Sounds like a very useful plugin at least, if not a setting that could be added. It could help everyone with this less than straightforward but critical point of a site launch.

There's no timeline, but this is something on the roadmap long-term.

The only plugins on there currently are the importers, which until 3.0 were
in core. They're still maintained by the core team.

What is the problem with storing relative URL's from the WP root in the
database, then have a contant in wp-config to store the site URL and when
called upon prepend the relative path with the site URL constant from
wp-config?  Does PHP really take a lot of processing to combine two
strings?  This way you move you site for whatever reason, you found a better
URL you like, or you're moving from stating to production, all it takes is a
simple change in wp-config.

How are you going to find the URL fragments that need prepending?

That is what takes all the unnecessary processing

I disagree with Peter in that WordPress already does what some would
consider "unnecessary processing" and what one considers unnecessary
processing might not be to another person. Setting this argument aside
completely and looking entirely at weighing the options, I would say that it
isn't worth changing. The problems with absolute URLs are really esoteric to
those who are developing and those that move sites. The majority of users
have no problems with absolute URLs and changing to relative will require a
lot of work with testing, development and correcting for bugs found with
edge cases.

Other than that, it really appears that majority of what people want could
be solved with a simple plugin and I think if enough people download, test
and use it that it might eventually be added to core.

So the argument comes down to this:

In the red corner, WordPress should store relative URLs. Relative to what,
I'm not sure, as WordPress is often in a subdirectory, which means we'll
always need to process the content to then add in the rest of the path. This
introduces overhead.

Keep in mind that there are two types of relative URLs, with and without the
leading slash. Both have caveats that make this impossible to properly
implement.

As Peter points out, I'm not even sure how we'd detect URLs we need to now
append to. A placeholder perhaps? What better placeholder than the domain
itself? Were there to be this implemented, it would actually decrease
portability of your content, as your content must now go through a
non-agnostic filter to actually be useful.

You can't sacrifice stability for perceived portability. Read that back.

In the blue corner, WordPress should (and does) store absolute URLs. This
requires no pre-processing of content, no overhead, no ambiguity. If you
need to relocate, it is a global find-replace in the database.

Really, what you should do, is reverse the deployment process, as Otto
suggests. Don't work off http://localhost/example/ then try to deploy to
example.com. Rather, have your install believe it is the live example.com,
then fake it to work on your staging environment. If it breaks on live, you
have a problem; it it breaks on staging, well, that's not much of a problem,
is it?

How? Personally, I edit my hosts file. Yes, this is how WP.org does it, but
no, this is not incompatible with clients (as has been suggested -- I
believe at one point I was called "out of touch" for suggesting this). Let
me explain.

Say your live install is perfect. Your staging install is local, and perhaps
you set it up so you modify your hosts file. But then you can also
creatively use the WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME constants, along with an extremely
simple output buffer, etc., to have the staging site reside at
staging.example.com. Again, the creative hacks should be on the staging
side, not the live side.

Now you have a development environment that you can link a client to, no
hosts file editing required. If an asset accidentally pulls from the live
site, then you're going to be fine. The reverse, of course, is not the case.

It's honestly trivial to properly set up a development environment that fits
the needs of both you and your client. I would just advise you that you look
at it from the production environment to the development environment, rather
than the other way around.

In the end, ultimately, what you have are thousands of developers all with
their own techniques. Over time, many of you will tune and perfect your own
techniques to match your own deployment cycles, processes, and requirements,
but notice the key words there: "your own". These techniques will likely
converge into neat categories, but it is largely a to-each-his-own issue.
This doesn't affect the vast majority of users. (And, may I add, that those
who are affected by it, generally have the added and convenient benefit of
knowing how to write code.) As Jacob just wrote, this is quite the esoteric
issue.

Nacin

I don't see what the problem is, now either I don't know any better (which
very well could be the case) or i'm not explaining this well (also very
possible).

If you have a blog at website.com/blog and one fo the paths stored in the
database for an item is website.com/blog/hello/world, store just
/hello/world in the db, store website.com/blog in a wp-config contant and
put the two together.  Move between environments just change the constant
and you're in business.

Now it's true you can just use hostfile, this is what I currently do, but
its not so clean,. especially if I have to goto my live site, I have to
remove the entry in my hostfile and restart.  Now I am sure if I looked I
could find a method that does not require a restart to switch sites, even a
virtual machine one with the modified hostfile would work.

But IMHO I think that's too much.  Why can't their be a clean simple method?

 It's a nice, idealistic approach and it works for most people who have simple scenarios but doesn't work for more complex scenarios.  Case in point, when a client asks to maintain several versions at several different subdomains (literally in my case "staging", "demo", and "demo2") and them all work all from their computers and their client's computers, and they want they each update periodically when they request managing multiple configurations simply gets to be too big of a PITA.

Yes it is possible when things start getting complex that I could juggle all the balls as you suggest and keep them all from dropping.  But it's an approach requires too much manual effort, and fails too easily.  In other words, that solution does work in many of the more simplistic cases but is not a panacea.

I've heard the refrain that "everyone's use-case is too different to create something that works for everyone" on many different platforms, for over 20 years.  I almost believed it back in the late 80s, but I've seen the assertion disproven too many times. The web disproved the assertion that "dissimilar computers can never be integrated onto a common network," and WordPress itself disproves the assertion that most websites can't be built on a single framework because their requirements are "too different."  Sure there are outliers, but the number of real outliers need only be tiny.

So I've seen this problem solved before on other platforms and I'll see it solved on future platforms again.  And it will be solved at some point in the foreseeable future for WordPress too, just probably not in core.

any reason why this isn't used then?

rss issues?
xml:base="http://www.relevantdomain.com/"


Or did I miss where these things aren't supported across the board?

There are a few things that are affected by the full URLs but are not
strictly problems for developers.

If you want to force a WP post or page to load via https, all of its
images will generate mixed-content warnings in the browser, because
they will load via http. Having relative URLs for media files would
help this. Or, even using //domain.com/file/photo.jpg would help (ie.
remove the protocol). Perhaps output buffering could help here.

If you run the WP backend with this turned on:
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);, the images in the rich editor will
still load via http, and this causes mixed-content warnings, too.
Perhaps output buffering could help here too.

Finally, in Multisite, it's not possible to change a site's path (ie.
change its URL), without also doing a find/replace in the database.
The WP backend lets you change the path, including siteurl and home,
but all of the absolute URLs in the content need to be changed as
well.

following up on a question i asked here a month ago,
re: calling Google's CDN copy of jquery but falling back on WP's  
installed copy
(for the few times -- and countries -- when Google is unavailable.)

solution ended up being:

in header.php:
wp_enqueue_script( 'jquery' );

in footer.php:
<script type="application/x-javascript">!window.jQuery &&  
document.write('<script src="<?php echo site_url() . "/wp-includes/js/ 
jquery/jquery.js"; ?>"><\/script>')</script>

putting both in head did NOT work, but above method does. more info:

('course, also requires de-/re-registering 'jquery' in functions.php  
to get Google's copy.)

I think this solution is better, just put this on in your functions.php:

function current_jquery($version) {
        global $wp_scripts;
        if ( ( version_compare($version, $wp_scripts ->
registered[jquery] -> ver) == 1 ) && !is_admin() ) {
                wp_deregister_script('jquery');

                wp_register_script('jquery',

'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/'.$version.'/jquery.min.js',
                        false, $version);
        }}

add_action( 'wp_head', current_jquery( '1.4.2' ) ); // change number
to latest version

+1. Bill sums up perfectly my next thoughts.

The interesting part of this, naming no names of course, is that some
people who fear the "unnecessary processing" for relative URLs, were
backing the Wordpress to WordPress unnecessary processing that occurs on
every init for WordPress.  ;)

Surely replacing Wordpress to WordPress is no different resource wise,
than replacing [shorttag] to URL?

Jeremy,

This is pretty much my new favorite thing ever, but do you know how  
it's affected by multisite?

I'm pretty sure it's mostly useless on multisite. When working with MU I
found that there really was no way to sync the databases without manually
manipulating a ton of fields in the DB.

When working in that situation I would recommend figuring out the SQL and
setting up a script for yourself that you can copy into your DB-manager of
choice (i.e. PHPMyAdmin on the server or Sequel Pro on OSX) and run against
the dev DB after importing a dump of the live site. It's not at all an ideal
solution, and if you're working with Multi-Site you have a lot more reasons
to try the hosts file method discussed above.

One trick to simplify the SQL method is to only manipulate the wp_options
for sites you actually plan to test, so if you have many similar sites in a
MS install your SQL only needs to modify a few exemplary ones you will test
against.

Bit of an open ended question here. Has anybody looked into, or
implemented, any form of revisions for post meta attached to a post?

A plugin of mine stores meta data with each post and I'd like this
meta data to be stored along with each post revision, so if a previous
revision is restored then the corresponding post meta data at that
revision is also restored.

Not sure about the best way to achieve this. Data in the post_meta
table is stored against post IDs, not post revision IDs, so this won't
work out of the box.

Any suggestions or thoughts appreciated.

John

On the save_post hook:

$wpdb->update( $wpdb->postmeta, array( 'post_id' => $rev_id ), array(
'post_id' => $post_id ) );

Metadata cannot be stored for revisions, but we only enforce that on the
*_post_meta() level. You can still use the *_metadata() functions to add
metadata to revisions.

Does anyone know why this might be happening? Could it be related to not

I think that many on this discussion are missing the critical issue for the Dev -> Stage -> Production process.

It is not the URLs stored in the post content.   Those are trivial to replace with a filter of post content. 

There are two big issues with deploying a website from development to a live site

1. The serialized arrays, plugin paths and other places the URL is stored
2. A way to export or deploy new pages, menus, plugin configuration, etc from development to production

Both of these issues need to be solved for Wordpress to fit well into a iterative development process.

Having to manually find replace though a DB, then manually recreate pages and configure plugins on a live website during a deployment is stressful, can be not automated and is not a reliable way to deploy a site.

Most of my post deployment issues come from forgetting to check some box in a plugin, or set the template of a page correctly.  A way to export the plugin settings, activation status, pages etc and some sort of best practice for storing URLs is the first step towards making this process smoother and more reliable for those of us who can not just DB dump the site and replace the live content.    

thanks,

Andrew

The ob_start solution I gave earlier will handle that case. The key is
to store the *actual* URL, then use code to adjust it on-the-fly for
your non-production sites.

Thanks. Before I go digging, if there's post meta data for a
particular revision ID would this meta data be automatically restored
along with the post data if and when that revision is restored? If not
I'll see what hooks we've got in place so my plugin can handle this
itself.

No, but there's a wp_restore_post_revision hook in the function of the same
name.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikoYEmcdKmExKVoHB2ff74ULUdUzqQspHRBtryX@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have a need to use an external script that uses PDO to interact
with the database.

We are also using HyperDB to access a master/slave configuration
between 2 servers.

Does anyone know how I can let the external script have access to the
currently available write connection (i.e. if master goes down slave
goes to write - but I need the username, password, host and port of
the currently available write server)?

I can see there are lots of variables in $wpdb - especially
$wpdb->dbh2host['global__w'] - which gives me the server name and port
but not login credentials (which I think are available elsewhere in
another array.

Cheers,

Chris.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=UHkzv4LsJUONzGPnp4g59XwKqO8PZxeXeS-7t@mail.gmail.com>

i'm building a listings site, where each post has two meta keys:

 - 'status' which can be a number of different values (e.g. active,
scheduled, awaiting payment, expired, error),
 - 'type' which can be a-premium, b-standard or c-normal.

on all multiple post pages (index, search, taxo, etc) i need to show only
those posts with a status of active, and they should be ordered by type (so
that premium listings appear before standard ones).

the first bit is easy enough, but i'm completely stuck on the second!

can anyone help with the SQL i need to achieve filtering on one meta value
while ordering on another?

i've pasted my current code at http://php.pastebin.com/Jg58KSz1 , this does
the filtering bit but not the ordering.

(ideally i would use custom post statuses for this, but this is not yet
fully developed enough in core to be usable.)

many thanks

I would recommend using custom taxonomies (http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Taxonomies 
). I think that will solve your problems.

i did consider that, but because i already have various taxonomies (e.g. for
town, category, etc), i would then need to query on multiple taxonomies and
sort on one of those, so i'm not sure that would solve the problem?

that's brilliant thank you scribu - i've worked backwards from the SQL
generated by your plugin and now have the posts_where, posts_orderby, etc,
all working correctly, so i don't need to use query vars (or your plugin!).
