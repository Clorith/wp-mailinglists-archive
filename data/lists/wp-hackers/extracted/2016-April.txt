Subject: [wp-hackers] "This plugin is not properly prepared for

The translations page for my plugin RSVPMaker displays the message shown
above

https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/rsvpmaker

That warning links to the instructions for internationalization, which I
have tried to follow. Most of the key output strings are encoded with __()
or _e(). I've created a POT file, and a few translations have been produced
by users of the plugin. I fixed one issue with the header, where the
"domain path" for the translation files wasn't specified, but I'm still
getting the same message.

How do I figure out what I'm missing?

There might be other issues as well, but I see you're setting the "Text 
Domain" in your plugin header as "rsvptoast", but then you're using 
"rsvpmaker" in all your translation functions. According to 
https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/ 
these must match, and your text domain must be set to the slug of your 
plugin.

Text Domain: rsvptoast

__('Thank you!','rsvpmaker');

Yes, this is the error that the import bot is reporting:

You can find the errors for you plugin on that slack channel. I think this has been documented somewhere (a post on the make blog, I think), but maybe it isn't mentioned in the handbook.

Okay, I forget this every time I want to do it, and can never find the info again?.  I have plugins in the Repository. How do I update the "Compatible Up To field? so it?s reflected on the plugin?s page?  I know I have to change the header in the Readme file, but where? Trunk? The latest Tag? Where?

(Frankly, the Latest Tag makes the most sense to me, but I don?t think that?s it.)

Somebody should really add this to the FAQ: https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/faq/

You will need to update it into latest tag as well.
