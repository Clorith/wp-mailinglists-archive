Also, just to clarify, the Fedora Dir Server isn't related to Fedora  
Core (the distro).

No windows, but it does run on Linux, Solaris and HP/UX.

LOL --  I'll say!  It's not even documented on the page you send me  
to.  (That page links to a broken link....)

I think I'll figure it out.... ;-)

Stephen

P.S. -- Viper: yours is another possibility.  I'll have to weigh the  
pros & cons for my particular case.  I think setting preferences is  
best.  If I _do_ change defaults down the road, that should affect  
new users, but not suddenly change things for people who have been  
using it for a while....

What is wrong with the following documentation that means it doesn't  
explain how register_activation_hook works?

<current_docs>
activate_{plugin-filename}

activate_{plugin-filename} is triggered when a plugin file of that  
name is activated. Instead of using it directly, use  
register_activation_hook($file, $function) where $fileis the plugin  
file (don't hardcode it... use __FILE__) and $function is the  
function you want to be run on plugin activation.

Context:

File: wp-admin/plugins.php
	if ('activate' == $_GET['action']) {
		$current = get_settings('active_plugins');
		if (!in_array($_GET['plugin'], $current)) {
			$current[] = trim( $_GET['plugin'] );
			sort($current);
			update_option('active_plugins', $current);
			include(ABSPATH . 'wp-content/plugins/' . trim( $_GET['plugin'] ));
			do_action('activate_' . trim( $_GET['plugin'] ));
		}
</current_docs>

It makes reasonable sense to me - if you have any feedback on making  
it more meanful let me know and I will get it updated.

Thanks for all the links - now I have no excuse to not deploy LDAP all
over the place! :-)

Just have to decide whether to run Linux in a VM and run a native LDAP
server or stick to Java on whatever....

:D

Just finished it off mostly. I think it's ready for a v1.0.0 release and I
can add more stuff further down the road (like infinite template include
looping checking).

Download it and check it out if you'd like:
http://files.viper007bond.com/wordpress/templatedia-v1.0.0-rc1.zip

And of course let me know if you find any bugs. ;)

Hello Peter!

I'm relatively new to WordPress, but I've been reading this list for 
some weeks now. This seems like a good opportunity to delurk. ;-)

Actually, this brief explanation had me quite confused when I tried to 
use the hook some weeks earlier. One thing I do remember is, that the 
given example is for a plugin file directly in the plugin directory. My 
file was in a sub-directory and it took me a while to figure out how to 
write this correctly.

So, an example like the following could be helpful (correct me if I get 
any of this wrong):

For the hook directly:
activate_{plugin-filename}  =>  activate_myplugin.php
activate_{folder-name/plugin-filename}  =>  activate_myfolder/myplugin.php

And an example for using the recommended function:
register_activation_hook(plugin_basename(__FILE__), 'myfunction');

I think, I had other problems in getting this to work, but I didn't take 
notes and it's been some weeks... ;-)

Greetings,
Johannes

This looks like good information to add.

You should pass __FILE__ directly to register_activation_hook - it  
calls plugin_basename itself (http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/ 
wp-includes/plugin.php#L248)

I think the example on wphooks needs so more example code as well. I  
will see about getting it updated.

It only works correctly for IIS on trunk at present ( due to issues  
with plugin_basename).

There isn't a management interface nor is one planned.  It might be
left to plugin territory.  For now we'll wait and see how many people
want one after 2.3 goes out.

It is intentional.  Term names and slugs are shared between taxonomies.

I don't think any plugins have been ported over yet.

Is there an option for Tags not to be included in the Feeds? Or do we have
to do this manually or with a plugin?

All taxonomy for a post is merged and put in the feed.  A plugin can
change this by using the 'the_category_rss'  filter.

Message-ID: <8f93a7390709012001y7f14dc25m7511872e7e0922a8@mail.gmail.com>

It'd be nice if we could wrap some tags (HTML comments perhaps?) around a
string of text in order to avoid having it be parsed by wpautop(),
wptexturize(), etc.

Yes, a plugin could probably pull this off, but it'd be so much easier if it
was in the core (no having to replicate functions, etc.)

Tons of plugins rely on placeholders in posts/pages in order to insert their
own HTML into posts (for example, a contact form). The problem with this is
if the plugin's filter runs at 11+, the placeholder could get malformed. If
it runs 9-, it's output HTML is to likely get malformed.

Not to mention all of the people that would like to post HTML directly into
a post.

Oh! Perhaps instead of no parse tags, there was a filterable array which
listed strings and/or regex to not match. I dunno, just throwing ideas on
the table for a future version.

Anyone else have any ideas or thoughts on this subject?

Sort of like MediaWiki's <nowiki></nowiki> tags?

Also, why not just use HTML entities?

Yeah, exactly.

And I'm giving that a try, as well as base64_encode/decode.

Great work, Jacob. But who do lobby to get this stuff pulled into the  
main WP repository? The presence of the tests in the main repository  
would not only encourage running them when changes are being made, but  
also encourage developers to add their own tests.

I'm not too familiar with the roles in WP, but I can imagine a  
collaborative environment where it makes sense to be able to fetch  
posts which you can't edit, in order to have context for editing/ 
submitting posts of one's own.

So the user should be able to fetch any post from XML-RPC that they  
would be able to browse in "Manage Posts" from wp-admin.

Alex Shiels is working on just such an effort, though it will likely
reside beside the main repository, or something ;-)

Let him know that he is welcome to pull from my repository, if it will 
help. The only technical license is from Sam Angove and that is "WTFPL" 
so consider all the tests as both WTFPL and BSD.

I think it would be excellent if there were a Continuous Integration for 
each commit or nightly to let developers and testers know who don't have 
the proper Unit Testing setup to see which tests failed. I was thinking 
about doing this myself, but I think Automattic would have a better 
chance of a perfect system than mine. Dude. The people who made Trac are 
also creating an Continuous Integration package to go with Trac. That 
might very well be useful. However, if not, I'll probably (maybe when 
phpUnit 3.2 is released) build a primitive system for tracking various 
metrics.

I think it is great that Automattic is finally doing something, though 
it appears they have been thinking about it long before my discussion 
and efforts. It would be cool, if something could be implemented  that 
prevents commits that break the tests, but perhaps it is an idea for 
another year or two from when the tests are completed.

It won't activate at all on my 2.2.2 install - I receive the "Plugin
could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error." message on
my plugins page. I deactivated all plugins and tried also with no
success. Upgraded to trunk and still received the fatal error message,
but with additional info:

Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '=', expecting ')' in
/home/crestvi0/public_html/news/wp-content/plugins/templatedia/templatedia.php
on line 551

Looking at the source, I realized it appeared to be a replication of a
PHP5 function, so I switched on PHP5 and it activated without a hitch,
but broke a couple other plugins. Any advice on getting it running on
PHP 4.4.4?

Sorry, that was a joke, really. I read the terms of the WTFPL [1] as
allowing arbitrary relicensing anyway, so don't worry about it.

I notice we have a bug about this that has been lingering.

Try out the patch on that ticket.  Looks like we need to get that in for 2.3.

I'd just apply the patch now, and see how it goes. If it don't help or 
work, just revert. Most of "us" are testers anyway, and know how to do 
SVN, or check for things. If something goes wrong, we can just let you 
know via the list and you can revert back if need be. But you even said 
it looks like a good patch, so what's to lose really? :P

I think it would be great if there were a more open write access (it 
would be a bitch to submit patches) for those who have signed up. Or at 
least able to sign up for it using the Codex, Trac, etc username and 
password.

I think whatever it is, it should at least join the current efforts and 
future efforts in one place instead of the current fragmented locations.

My comment should probably be changed to document that clean_url()
checks to see if the URL is well formed and nothing more whilst
wp_kses_bad_protocol() checks to see if the URL's scheme is desirable
and nothing more.

Is it possible to assign tags to posts via XMLRPC?
Actually, a better question would be if any of the standard
remote-blogging protocols have support for tags, and if WP conforms to
that.

I haven't seen support for tagging (no matter what the remote blogging
engine) in any of the Windows or Linux desktop blogging clients;
though I'm thinking of writing a plug-in for Windows Live
Writer.......

No offense intended.  I tend to make a distinction between "do this"  
documentation and "here's what this does" documentation, and that  
page is the former.  What I was remarking on was that the page that  
one links to (presumably with more info) is down.  It just struck me  
as funny that the page was down in the wake of a statement that it  
wasn't well documented.

It's a pretty straightforward function though -- I looked at the  
source (something I've been doing a LOT of lately ;)  ) and got what  
I wanted from that.

I was glad for that page's suggestion to pass __FILE__ to the  
function though -- I wouldn't have thought of that....

MovableType supports it in the form of a mt_tags parameter (and -  
apparently on a per-installation basis? with mt_keywords).

MarsEdit (the Mac client app I develop) will support editing tags as  
soon as I can get my head completely around where everybody is heading  
with protocol support for them :)

G'day,

I've copied this information onto the codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/activate_%28plugin_file_name%29

Just for the record, I read the documentation on that link and couldn't 
figure out what it meant. It also links to an as-yet-uncreated page on 
redalt.com. Likewise, there is no documentation for the 
register_activation_hook($file,$function) plugin on the codex. Would 
anyone who knows what it does like to add it?
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Function_Reference/register_activation_hook&action=edit

Cheers,


Callum.

I wouldn't use register_activation_hook() because it won't get
triggered on updates, and if people install in different directories
it's useless too. Instead you could just query an option (get_option)
for a version of your plugin on each invocation and call the
appropriate update function if it's not there or lower than what you
need.

If you use __FILE__ in your call to register_activation_hook then it  
will not matter what the folder name is.

But yes it won't be called for updates.

Maybe we need a register_update_hook which could be called when  
WordPress detects a version change in a plugin.
This would need WordPress to store the version info for all active  
plugins though.
Maybe a feature for 2.4.

I looked around and found mt_tags and mt_keywords.  From what I saw  
it seemed like mt_keywords was the more supported of the two (and by  
that I mean I actually found docs for mt_keywords, where I didn't  
find hardly anything but a mention here and there for mt_tags).

And since someone else had already done most of the work to get  
mt_keywords going:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/900

we went with that.

If you are interested in XML-RPC issues in WordPress we also have a  
mailing list for that:

For those who don't care about this plugin: sorry for yet another post to
the list. I promise I'll stop soon. :P

For the rest of you: alright, here should hopefully be the final
1.0.0version (lots and lots of changes):

http://files.viper007bond.com/wordpress/templatedia-v1.0.0-rc3.zip

I also bundled another miniplugin I've been working on which adds the "Chess
diagram" template from Wikipedia (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Chess_diagram ) to Templatedia.

Yeah, that's right, you can post any of these standard board size examples
into a post and Templatedia will properly parse it and display it as it does
in Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Chess_diagram#Examples

I wrote it as just a small example as to Templatedia's power. :D

WordPress MU needs something similar. 'mu-plugins' never get their
activation/deactivation hooks called, because there is no concept of
activating or deactivating mu-plugins (you just add/delete the .php
files from the mu-plugins directory). All it does is run include() on
wp-content/mu-plugins/*.php.

Some plugins (particularly those that add DB tables) break with the lack
of these hooks, and I would like to see WordPress MU work differently in
that area.

Why does WordPress only support MySQL? What about DB abstraction?


While in theory supporting more databases is better than supporting one, 
in practice we've found focusing on MySQL has a number of benefits.

First, introducing support for databases other than MySQL would increase 
the testing load for all development quite a bit, as already the 
combinations of PHP versions, web servers like Apache, Lighttpd, and 
IIS, and Windows vs Linux cause a number of issues, multiplying that by 
an arbitrary number of database platforms is daunting.

Early on in WordPress' history when DB abstraction was seriously 
considered we noticed packages like AdoDB were bigger than WordPress 
itself, which seemed like a lot of weight for little gain.

DB independence also requires far more than just dropping in a DB 
abstraction class, as basic assumptions WP makes about things like 
primary keys, indicies, auto incrementing fields, LIMITs, and more vary 
more from DB to DB than a class could support without serious code changes.

Finally, MySQL is ubiquitous and has shown to be fast enough and 
scalable enough for the highest traffic loads, so supporting other DBs 
would not improve the WordPress experience or our popularity much. As a 
feature request it comes of fairly infrequently.

All that said, every query in WordPress goes through a class called wpdb 
and that class can be replaced with your own by putting a db.php file in 
wp-content. So far this has been used for mysqli support and an advanced 
enterprise DB class called HyperDB, but in theory you could use that, 
and some wicked regular expressions, to add support for a MySQL-like 
database without any core code modifications.

Answer: It is the standard of PHP developers, which was agreed on and

I had a more sarcastic reply, but I figure that since I don't want to

it go.

Addendum:

There is a difference between Database Access Abstraction, which 
WordPress already supports, and Database Abstraction, which is a 
misnomer. Database Abstraction is difficult unless you use the most 
basic of SQL, and even then you are not guaranteed full support. Each 
database has features and optimizations that should be applied to each 
database.

As for Database Abstraction, more advanced coders would suggest what 
WordPress already does. By creating an API to wrap SQL, it allows for 
the SQL and Database Access Layer can be changed to fully support the 
new database. Doing so will most likely keep the same functionality 
working, which is what Database Abstraction tries to solve.

Indeed, and I think we had discussions on this lists of the benefits of
generic SQL support, and we decided (IIRC) that there are more benefits
of a specialized MySQL interface in order to have the advantages of
certain MySQL features (such as SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS).  

I also remember that some people wanted to create Postgres and other
ports, though I don't remember if those were ever released, and if so,
if they're still maintained.

By the way, why don't we have a list for bikeshed discussions? If
somebody starts discussing things like PHP4 vs. 5, or MySQL vs. Postgres
vs. Oracle, or Blogroll vs. Links vs. Bookmarks, we could just send them
over to the wp-bikeshed list. ;-)

What's wrong with using this list? I thought that was the exact purpose of
this list -- to discuss the future of WordPress.

I'm talking about endless nonsense discussions about irrelevant details
(I've named examples im my previous post). We've had a couple of them in
the last time, and I seriously considered unsubscribing from this list.
But seriously, my proposal regarding "wp-bikeshed" was of rather ironic
intent.

By the way, I'm afraid that if we really had a wp-bikeshed list, there
would be even more discussions on this list. Not only the nonsense
discussion, but, in addition, a meta-discussion whether it is a
wp-bikeshed issue or not. ;-)

I agree.
mu-plugins seems like nothing more than an auto-include directory. if 
it's really a plugins directory it should follow the same conventions 
(and should use the same code WP uses to activate them).

I noticed missing from current mu-plugins functionality:
1. plugins in directories are ignored.
2. no activation/deactivation functionality, which means plugins that 
need to have some first time setup can't easily be fit there.

the common wisdom is that mu-plugins is for plugins that users may not 
deactivate. this is fine, and a good functioanlity for wpmu - but not at 
the cost of incompatibility with existing plugins:
the mare fact that a plugin may not be deactivated by a user does not 
imply in any way that it may not be deactivated by the admin, or that it 
must not rely on a one time activation sequence.
I think wpmu should have a "System plugins" page, with the same 
functionality as the plugins page (activate/deactivate), that will only 
be accessible to the site admin.


I understand that this probably means some work on the core wordpres 
files, to allow the code that handle the plugins initialization to work 
for mu-plugins as well, but I think it's worth it.

Another issue is that introducing support for other databases will break 
many many existing plugins that assumes MySQL.

I think it would be better to just use the regular plugins folder and set 
per-plugin permissions/capabilities to whom might edit what plugins.

Why? Because two folders with plugins will give you problems such as two 
plugins can have the same name (folder name), which plugins are installed 
where and such...


All plugins could per default only be editable by the "site admin" user. Then 
the siteadmin can grant access to a subset of the plugins to regular blog 
admins.

This is a pretty good suggestion that will also achieve the same effect 
of making mu-plugins first class citizens.
I understand the need for some simple auto-activation folder, but full 
fledged plugins achieve the same effect and are more powerful and 
flexible, so maybe it's best if mu-plugins went byebye.

Agreed. I think that _all_ plugins for WordPress MU need to be stored in
wp-content/plugins, and they are whitelisted for users to enable using a
similar interface to the current one for themes.

Currently, all WordPress MU themes are stored in wp-content/themes, and
for them to be enabled publicly, the site admin goes to the theme admin
page, and ticks 'Yes' to whitelist the theme for public usage.

The plugins should work the same way. You can whitelist them for being
able to be activated by users. Also, they should be able to be set as a
forced-on invisible plugin (exactly the way mu-plugins are), and when
_these_ types of plugins are enabled or disabled, the
activation/deactivation hooks should be called for each blog in the
system via WP-Cron. Also, whenever someone signs up for a new blog, the
activation hooks should be run.

I am not sure about the last bit.
There are two different kind of plugins:
* the common ones, are plugins for specific blogs - and as such they 
should be activated in the blog context.
* plugins that are system wide, and have a single instance for the 
entire wpmu site.

Maybe it's enough for plugins to register the new_blog action and to 
activate there for that blog (using swtich_to_blog() before doing the 
stuff).
in any case - one thing is sure:
wpmu is not documented nearly well enough, and there is a lot of 
confusion among plugin authors about how to support it.

Question: Where is X function defined?

Although I usually find function definitions and the like with grep,
it might be nice for other developers if there were something like
PHPXref for trunk and release versions of WordPress on wordpress.org
(as opposed to being hosted on the personal site of someone who no
longer contributes to WP).

Your FAQ could link to that.

Some questions out of my head:

1. Why not using OOP / MVC framework/plattern?

2. Why not using Smarty?

Could we put this on Codex? This would share the load and allow people 
to add new questions as they arrive. Any further discussion around the 
issue could be kept to the talk pages on Codex. That allows for 
discussion, but also allows for the recurring questions to be answered 
with a single link. Somebody might even write a fancy regex for mailman 
to automatically filter the standard questions... :)

G'day,

I've been doing some research on WordPress optimisation and I whipped up 
a new page on the Codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Optimization

I'm guessing there will be a good few people on the list who have 
experience in this area, so please feel free to give me your comments 
on/off list or simply edit the page.

The article is a combination of techniques I read about at a bunch of 
different sites (links are at the bottom of the page). It's aimed to be 
a general overview of the areas of optimisation, not a detailed 
technical walkthrough.

Cheers,


Callum.

That was indeed the main reason.

The Postgres Port was mostly working (couple of bugs), but well... it
died off, too.

I still maintain that the best way of porting to another system is a
new library + regex plugin; it has worked in the past and is
practically bulletproof.

Question: isn't it recommended to host DNS servers on the same domain
as what they point to?

That's what my webhost recommended I do (verses having my domain name
registrar's servers act as the DNS servers for my domain name); and on
DNS-rating sites you get "points" subtracted for having your DNS on a
different domain than your own.

I could be wrong, just didn't want the WP codex to have something that
might possibly be not good.

I made something like this a while back when I was having issues with
WordPress breaking some javascripts I was putting in the post content.

A similar solution should work for you.

I think the title is a bit ambiguous, as I thought that it was going  
to be about SEO... I'd recommendrenaming it to something like  
WordPress Speed Optimization :)

I think among most software engineers and developers... at least the circles
I'm in... the meaning of "Optimization" is as the page describes it... and
not SEO.

(And this being a mailing list for software engineers and developers... that
name seems entirely appropriate.)

I've got a plugin that uses text that's within HTML comments, but the  
editor foils any attempts to put tag-like elements _or_ accented  
characters/entities in them.  I see all kinds of screwy effects.

I would love to see some code that tells the editor the leave the  
enclosed the heck alone.

But it looks like Michael already put my reply on the Codex so I'll kep

I would suggest going from biggest impact to smallest impact. Start with 
WP-Cache, get down to multiplier tweaks like a PHP accelerator and minor 
server stuff (query_cache), and end with front-end optimization, with a 
link to resources like:

http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/
http://www.websiteoptimization.com/services/analyze/

It's probably also worth watching and linking to Barry's presentation 
from WordCamp:

http://onemansblog.com/2007/08/16/wordcamp-2007-hyperdb-and-high-performance-wordpress/
http://barry.wordpress.com/2007/07/22/high-performance-wordpress/

Finally, Lightpress is a separate project which is mostly-not-compatible 
with WordPress, I don't think it should be suggested as an optimization 
technique.

Good idea for a topic! Please add a link to your page from

Hello,

You know... one thing that would be nice is if filters and action
hooks could pass along "freshness" data.

That way you could use for caching strategies.


So say for example... let's say you have a filter called 'the_label'.
And you call...

$label = apply_filters('the_label', $x);

And let's say $x has been the same since "2007-08-24 @ 11:02am".

Well... if there are no filters being applied, then $label should have
that same "freshness" date as $x.

However... if there are other filters... then they'd want to modified
that freshness data.

Let's say there is only one filter... and that filter is
"mathematically functional... i.e., it returns the exact same output
for the same input.

Then if you want to change the "freshness" date (of $label) to the max
of the "freshness"  date of $x and the activation date of the plugin
that filter is a part of.


This type of thing would be very useful in scaling.  (Especially for
people running big WordPress MU installs.)


See ya

I've never heard that hosting DNS on the same server is a bonus. We run 
each service on a separate IP even if it's on the same server, to allow 
for easier separation later.

I know that all the big sites run DNS separately from their web servers, 
it just wouldn't be practical to host DNS on the same box as the 
application. So based on that, I'm pretty confident that there's no 
downside to hosting DNS separately.

I'm interested to hear more on the subject though. Can your web host 
provide any links to support their recommendation? I searched for "dns 
rating" but I couldn't find anything relevant. Could you post any links 
to DNS rating sites?

Cheers - Callum.

Normal practice is to have at least two name servers, which should be on
physically separate networks. If your name servers are on the same network
as the application server, then in the event of a loss of connectivity, your
domain drops off the internet in the worst possible way - rather than
getting error messages indicating that the server is inaccessible, visitors
will get "no such domain" errors.

That's bad for web servers. If you're running email on the domain, it's
potentially catastrophic - instead of messages being queued for delivery
when the server comes back, they'll bounce with extreme force...

@Charles: Good point. I'm not familiar with WordPress MU so I wouldn't 
have much to add. However, all the server stuff applies to WordPress MU 
as it applies to WordPress. I've added a short note on that, feel free 
to expand it if you like. Cheers - Callum.

Hey matt,

I agree, caching is the highest impact so it makes sense for it to be 
first. I was thinking about the process in terms of improving each 
stage, from DNS down. It made sense in my head anyway! I've added a note 
at the top with a link straight to caching.

Thanks for the link to the presentation, I'm watching it now. I've added 
a link to that and the other two sites you mentioned.

Cheers - Callum.

I ended up doing a base64_encode() on the users input, {{this part here}},
and then decoding it at a high filter level. Not the prettiest thing in the
world, but it works perfectly.

This really isn't a thread about _asking_ bikeshed questions, it's about
_answering_ them and compiling them up.

Hello everybody,

As my Google Summer of Code project, I developed a "drag and drop" jQuery
plugin with support for pagination whose main goal was to be used for easily
ordering the pages in the WP. It is now integrated into WP and almost
finalized.

I set up a sandbox where you can test it. I would really appreciate if some
of you could take a look at it and give me your thoughts and suggestions. I
recommend you to use FF to test it (there is still a minor cosmetic issue in
IE). More information on:

Cheers,

Bernardo

One little bug, you can drag stuff off to the side and scroll right off the
page.

Hi John,

Thanks for the input. This is hard to define as a bug, as it happens to
every "drag and drop" usage I have ever seem on the web, including
WordPress' Widgets and even igoogle.com (try draging an element to the right
side and you will notice the scrollbar). What could be done is preventing
horizontal scrolling, but that would have terrible side-effects. I think
there is no problem in this behavior.

[]s Bernardo

I agree, but I think that these questions are worth mentioning, and I
believe some others will give a better answer than me

Hi Bernardo,

I was referring to the fact that you can actually get this one to scroll. I
drag the item so far over you can no longer see any of the admin interface.
With igoogle you can make the bar appear but you can't drag it off the
screen.

You mean, is it scrolling automatically? Or only when you use the scrolling
wheel or something alike. It shouldn't scroll automatically (over here it
doesn't, it could be a browser related bug). If it is the second case, in
the Widgets in WordPress is also possible to do that (drag it and scroll to
the right until everything is gone).

Ok, I now got what you mean. It is scrolling automatically. It should be
pretty easy to fix.

Such questions are difficult to answer. There aren't any clear 
definitive answers to them. If you do it right (such as WordPress does), 
procedural coding can be manageable. That is really the goal, when 
coding, write manageable code that can be easily extended and reused. 
When either breaks then the code becomes worthless and you will need to 
refactor. As such, OOP can also lead quickly to unmanageable code when 
bitches choose to use the Singleton design pattern and place as many 
methods as possible into a single class.

A class should only have methods pertaining to its specific purpose, and 
using other class patterns when needed. Violators should be shot, but 
okay, everyone has to learn sometime and I was a big violator when I 
started out in C++. However, I think Java naturally moves people into 
other acceptable class patterns if beginners choose to model their code 
off the standard library. C# is good with this also and also a very 
beautiful language.

I'm big on OOP, since it allows a more refined control over using 
Globals and the mess that can result. I'm not a purist however, 
procedural code is beautiful when done right.

WordPress already uses MVC is most places. I think one the worse 
violator would have to the administration and I believe the reasoning 
behind this is that no one should be editing it except the core devs. As 
for a Framework, for my two sense, that is a extremely difficult 
decision. Do you choose Zend, CakePHP, EzComponents, etc? When you bind 
yourself to one, you restrict the level of other devs who will work on 
your code. It is easier for most projects, because the focus should be 
on the model and not the controller and view implementations.

One reason for not using them is that you pull in their security issues, 
the library bloat, and the added abstraction isn't needed in most cases. 
Not really true for the controller, as that should be abstracted, but 
the overhead would be less without a template View.

Why use Smarty? PHP is a template engine, smarter people would say that 
abstracting PHP is unnecessary overhead. Gallery 2 uses Smarty, good for 
them, the model is good stuff. In my opinion, the added complexity of 
the Smarty API and adding modules is more than it is worth. If you 
really designers that don't know any programming at all, then just use 
XSLT. You'll probably find everything faster. However, good luck, my 
crappy implementation didn't work out as well as I had planned (even 
though, technically, I didn't plan anything), and XSLT from what I've 
read and tested, only works on XML.

PHP 5 XSLT doesn't seem to like for PHP in the XML file, and if you can 
fix this problem, then please I would like to see the code.

The answer is really based on the decisions of the leads. I would 
recommend that any decision be based on the collective technical skills 
of the team, since that is what I've read to do. I'm just a massager.

That's not true.  You can only get "no such domain" if you get an
NXDOMAIN answer from a name server.  When none of the name servers can
be reached, you get a temporary failure (typically SERVFAIL or no answer
at all).  Your website cannot be reached, but mail will be queued.

If all your services are on a single network, it doesn't really buy
you much to have your name servers distributed outside it.  During an
outage, in the best case the visitor still gets a good DNS answer, but
won't be able to reach the site.  In the case of mail, the message still
gets queued.

That's interesting, but doesn't conform to my own experience of domains set
up that way. I have seen mail bounce when the name servers for a domain are
not contactable. With no MX records available, most mail servers I'm aware
of will not queue mail but will return it to sender. Mail gets queued for
redelivery attempts when the server knows where to send it - if there is no
known destination it's less likely to be queued.

Mail servers set their own queuing policies. For example, I've heard 
that Hotmail will only try once then bounce it back to the user.

I generally support the theory that distributed DNS is a good thing. 
Aside from anything else, it reduces the risk that DNS will go down and 
then who cares whether your servers are up?!

I've refactored the page[1] again this time separated according to the 
type of hosting. There's no point talking about server optimisation to 
users who are on shared hosting. So I've split the content into multiple 
pages and grouped them according the hosting architecture.

Again, any feedback most welcome.

Cheers - Callum.

You should have an Edit Page Order button on the top and bottom of the 
Manage->Pages view. If you have a lot of categories, I wouldn't want to 
scroll all the way down to click it.

Very good -
Put the new "order pages" button at the _top) of the standard page list 
(or top and bottom) - it is not obvious the button exists when there are 
a lot of pages, and will save scrolling all the way down.

I have added several more pages, to test 1st/last/middle screens on your 
"page order".
It gets a bit exciting when trying to move a page with a lot of children 
to the "next Entries".
I see that  you can move a group over more than one listing page by 
"hover over previous page", then move the mouse and hover it again (once 
you get used to it!)
 Doesn't work so well for "next" though, but I cant see how you could 
easily change it...
It might be simpler, although less fancy, to simply keep the display 
constant, and when user drops a group of pages into previous or next, 
simply show the previous or next page with the dropped group at the top 
- yes it would take a second drag to position it on the new page, but 
may be clearer to users - something to think about maybe?
The number of items on a listing page varies (I think) to keep child 
pages with the top level one - this is good - but dragging a large group 
to the bottom (to move them) the display can get rather confusing as it 
refreshes.
Overall an very good feature.

Hi Chris,

Thanks for the thoughtful comments.

I will put "Edit Page Order" on the top. The problem with "Next Page" you
might be referring to is probably that it takes some time to load the pages
from the server. Once a page has been loaded, it stays cached, so it loads
up instantly (the case of "Previous").

The "Page Refreshing" you mentioned is actually an animation for the page
transition. It can easily be changed to some other type (such as flashing,
etc), I added support for it in the component. It is there to make it
clearer to the user that something changed. If we turn it off (what is easy
to do as well), the next page appears instantly and the change is hard to
notice. I agree it can make things a little "bumpy" on the transition,
JavaScript is crappy on most browsers (I would say it is good on Safari and
decent on FF), specially if your machine is a little slow.

In the overall, the pagination of this component is a very hard problem to
solve,  due to nesting and the need to move one element from one page to the
other. Even with a lot of effort (I would say more than 50% of the work done
was related to pagination support), it is hard to find a way that it will
fell more natural to the user. So, I think pagination at a large number of
pages (50 or 100) is probably the best way to go. It will be there only for
those few users that actually need it (because they have hundreds of pages).

Cheers, Bernardo

I have found that when text is replaced on a page with little visual  
indication, it's sometimes hard to notice.  When using the next/ 
previous function, I would suggest some visual cue of the "page  
change", such as the list sliding to the side to be replaced with the  
new list.  (The first time I tried it as it is, I sat there for a  
second waiting for it to change, then realized it already had....)

A good example of what I'm talking about:  In my office building they  
have TV screens in the elevators that run news blurbs and such.   
Sometimes it goes from one newsclip to another without any change of  
background, and if I'm part way through reading one when this happens  
I can keep on reading from where where I was.  I get some of the  
_weirdest_ stories this way! :)

This is a very cool plugin.  :)

Hi Barnardo,
Yes, I am sure the pagination was the hard bit, which is why I added 
pages to try it!

The "Next Page" bit actually wasn't referring to the time taken, which 
was fast - but to dragging a group to the bottom and dropping it - the 
changes to the underlying page seemed busy and confusing at first - I 
forget the exact sequence but it occurs when dropping the pages over the 
bottm "hover here" area...
Obviously I haven't seen it with the animation turned off, and so can't 
comment if that is better or worse!

Yikes. I can see where that works, but why go to that much trouble?
Just pull the relevant text out of the post content entirely, stick it
in a global array, and put a placeholder in it's place. Then at the
higher level, find the placeholder, replace it with the text in the
global array. Less overhead of encoding and decoding and such.

This is similar to how the plugin I posted before works:

My experience with MVCs in PHP has been that they're horridly slow and
bloated - and definitely not worth it for something other than an
in-house project where you have complete vertical control over
everything from the server to the code to what gets implemented and
what doesn't.

I don't know what you mean about XSLTs not liking PHP in the XML, I
haven't had any problem with that... You serve a PHP document with a
file-type header for XML, add a reference to an XSLT file, and you're
done. Server-side PHP code doesn't make a difference, whether it is in
the XSLT or the XML (though it's not recommended to stick it in the
XSLT since most browsers do some really heavy caching in that
department); so long as the *final buffered output* from the server is
pure standard XML, it doesn't make a difference if it was once PHP,
CGI, or C#.

Anyway, just my two cents....

Good idea :-)

With regards to DNS optimization, the service I was using to check my
DNS is http://dnsstuff.com/ I can't link to the test page itself
because their main site isn't loading right on my PC just now... only
the first couple of kb load then it cuts off :S

Hi Bernardo, good job!

I was thinking to try something similar but with scriptaculous (have 
some experience with it). Instead of loading all Pages and having 
several pages listing... Pages, I was thinking to load only the top 
Pages (with parent = 0) and use them as the containers - they would have 
an open/close box on the right, like the draggable menus on the write 
page. Then, when the user opens a top Page, using ajax to fetch all 
sub-pages for it, allowing only 2 or 3 top Page containers to be open at 
the same time to reduce clutter. Perhaps something to try for the next 
version.

Dragging off the edge of the window - you should be able to (easily) 
constrain the dragging to vertical only. There's no need for horizontal 
dragging there. The insertion guide shows clearly where the dragged Page 
titles will drop.

The only bug I see (well, more of a cosmetic issue) is that the page 
sometimes flickers quite noticeable when starting a drag, in both FF and 
Opera.

Yes. You can override existing methods or add new methods entirely by
use of the "xmlrpc_methods" filter.

I think horizontal dragging does have a place, though -- it's allows  
you to distinguish between a child page and a sibling.

And this thread [1] from last year. In particular this post [2]
should give you pointers on how to use that filter.

Hi all,

 

I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to set default text to come up for
new posts? I'm working on a site where all blog entries will follow a
similar template and it would be great if I could somehow embed default
text.

 

Thanks!

There's a filter for 'default_content' that can be used in a plugin to 
define default content for posts.

When all else fails, check the action/filter lists:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference

This one is in the "administrative screen" section of the filter 
reference.

Heh, that's actually what I ended up doing later:


$hash = sha1( $match[1] );
$this->encodedtemplates[$hash] = $match[1];
$content = str_replace( $match[0], $template_opener . '[templatediaencoded]'
. $hash . '[/templatediaencoded]' . $template_closer, $content );


$content = str_replace( $match[0], $template_opener .
$this->encodedtemplates[$match[1]] . $template_closer, $content );


Works well and now that I'm thinking about it, I probably could probably
even just use like uniqid() or even an auto-incrementing value (1, 2, 3,
etc.) to reduce the overhead further.

Horizontal dragging allow you to change the parent/child level - without 
changing the vertical position if you want too!
very useful

Note the code below is assuming you mean the PHP5/libxslt-based XSL  
features (not the older Sablotron-based ones)
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.xsl.php

That's because the XML is not pre-processed when loaded through  
DOMDocument (before being forked off to XSLTProcessor).

The only way to process an XML file with PHP in it (that I know of)  
is to use DOMDocument->loadXML() coupled with a file_get_contents()  
call on a URL, instead of DOMDocument->load() on a local file. That  
forces it to pass though httpd+php and your XSLT process therefore  
only gets the rendered output.

This said, it's obviously not the best performance, but I've used it  
once in the past and coupled with caching, it's not bad at all when  
you benchmark it against a similar DB query or so.

Sweet! Thanks.

That would have worked great, but it is too bad I've abandoned the code 
or I would probably have tried this method.

Sweet thanks. Worked like a charm. One more question: any idea how I would
go about ensuring that this only happened on posts and not pages?

This will probably do the trick:

if ( 'post-new.php' == basename($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']) ) add_filter(
'default_content', 'your_function' );

Abandoning the code might not have been a bad idea. ;)

I've been following XSL since its inception as a draft, and I have to  
admit I've never found it to be the best solution to my problems in  
dynamic environments (see exception below). I tried quite a few times  
when it was a legitimate candidate, and It definitely has its  
strength, but I'm not a big fan. One of the reason is that one of its  
supposed applications is to serve as a *middleware* language between  
backend and frontend coders, but I've never found any designers who  
could figure out XSLT anymore than they could figure out PHP. And if  
they do/did, they just use(d) PHP directly (since as you mentioned,  
it is a templating engine itself). :)

This this date, I've only ever used it once in a long-term production  
environment (to convert custom embedable XML tags to a dynamic output  
in a CMS environment. Where it makes the most sense is in processes  
like docbook->HTML (etc) batch processes (and PHP isn't always the  
best solution for that, though not a bad one).

That's pretty much what I did:

if (preg_match_all("{\<script(.*)\<\/script\>}siU", $text, $temp)) {
		while (list($k, $v) = each($temp[0])) {
			$text = str_replace($v, '<!-- h'.$k.'h -->', $text);
			$inlinescripts[$k] = $temp[1][$k];
		}
	}

...

while (list($k, $v) = each($inlinescripts)) {
			$text = str_replace('<!-- h'.$k.'h -->', '<script'.$v.'</script>', $text);
		}


I used the <!-- --> comments so that if I did miss something, I
wouldn't get weird crap in my page.

Does anyone get the feeling we're being left out?

I mean, if you're going to add it to WP.com, you _may_as_well_ add it to
WP.org too.

Finished the simple plugin. I found there was one already out there, but it
didn't handle BBCode or anything like that. Mine's a bit better in that it
handles BBCode (like WP.com), encodes HTML characters automatically (no more
< to &gt; yourself), and only loads the Javascript files that you actually
need (rather than all of them).

I'll throw it up on the official WordPress plugins area as soon as it gets
approved. :)

G'day,

Anyone know who's ass needs a kickin? :)

Cheers,


Callum.

And we will have a problem with the auto update as soon as that gets 
checked in. (See my other unanswered mails some time ago.) I'm willing 
to contribute some code, or do some administration work (approving, etc).
Cheers

Thanks for the link (I never could find that)
I dont think the Donation link is required, and the screenshots section isnt required either..
Eg, Run the wordpress stats readme through it: http://svn.wp-plugins.org/stats/trunk/readme.txt

I think there might be something else happening at a higher level (I even converted it to unix line endings instead of win32..)

Does anyone know who is looking after this at the moment? Who would need 
to give you the necessary passwords / authorisation / etc? - C.

You don't _need_ either of those. They are entirely optional.

Approval seems to be taking some time, but it does go through.

My two last requests took about 3 weeks, but they were approved in  
the end.
There was a bug in the "add plugin" tool around August 15th, but it's  
been fixed since then.

The plan was to get it in to 2.3 (hence #4807) but the first iteration 
of wordcount kind of sucked, and a better version wasn't finished until 
yesterday, long after our feature freeze. Don't worry though, Mike 
should update his patch soon and it'll be one of the first things in 2.4.

Let's coordinate our code there, there's no reason to maintain two 
versions that do identical things.

Subject: [wp-hackers] checking roles in a plugin?
Message-ID: <00a701c7f0f1$ebdf8f30$c39ead90$@com>

Hi -

How can you do a simple role check within a plugin before echoing some
content to the screen?

I'm trying to do something like this:

if (current_user_can('edit_posts')) {
	$var = 'sweet!';
}

But that isn't working at all. Any ideas?

Thanks,
Damian Taggart, President

Well, that's how you do it.  Are you testing it as the administrator?
If not, are you absolutely sure that the user you're testing it as has
the edit_posts capability?  Refer to Roles_and_Capabilities [1] on the
Codex to be sure.

No problem, sorry for the delay. Since we made the process a lot easier 
there's been a ton of junk coming in, it takes a lot more time to go 
through it now.

If someone is "stuck" feel free to send me a ping on private email.

Sure you're echoing the variable out? (There's no echo in your code
snippet, that's all, and sometimes it's the simplist things...).

Hi - 

I'm trying to add some custom code to the Dashboard but when I add the
current_user_can('edit_posts') bit in all I get is a blank white page.

Here's basically what I'm trying to do (add a custom 'Getting started'
section):


<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Customizations
Plugin URI: Yada yada
Description: Some tweaks to the WP backend.
Version: 1.0
Author: Yada yada
Author URI: Yada yada
*/

$mindshareContent = '<h3>Welcome to ' . get_bloginfo('title') . '</h3><p>Use
these links to get started:</p><ul>';

if (current_user_can('edit_posts')) {
	$mindshareContent .= '<li><a href="page-new.php">Write a new
page</a></li>';
	$mindshareContent .= '<li><a href="edit-pages.php">Edit a
page</a></li>';
}
$mindshareContent .= '<li><a href="profile.php">Update your profile or
change your password</a></li></ul>';

Sure you're echoing the variable out? (There's no echo in your code
snippet, that's all, and sometimes it's the simplist things...).

Hi again, 

Here's an even more concise example of my issue, when I activate this plugin
all bets are off - blank white screen. Why would this be killing WP?

<?php
/*
Plugin Name:poop
*/

if ( current_user_can('edit_posts') ) {
	//stuff
}

?>

Well, that's how you do it.  Are you testing it as the administrator?
If not, are you absolutely sure that the user you're testing it as has
the edit_posts capability?  Refer to Roles_and_Capabilities [1] on the
Codex to be sure.

Your problem is that WP isnt fully loaded at the point where you're running the current_user_can() function.
If you have errors enabled then you'd be seeing this error instead of the white screen:

 Fatal error: Call to undefined function wp_get_current_user() in C:\www\wordpress\wp-includes\capabilities.php on line 446
Call Stack
#	Time	Memory	Function	Location
1	0.0213	116592	{main}( )	..\index.php:0
2	0.0219	176184	require_once( 'C:\www\wordpress\wp-admin\admin.php' )	..\index.php:2

6	0.8930	8162136	current_user_can( )	..\test.php:13
(Well, thats got a stack trace too..)

By the look of it you'll want to change to using a hook instead:

add_action('load-index.php','test_init');
function test_init(){
global $mindshareContent;

$mindshareContent = '<h3>Welcome to ' . get_bloginfo('title') . '</h3><p>Use these links to get started:</p><ul>';
if (current_user_can('edit_posts')) {
	$mindshareContent .= '<li><a href="page-new.php">Write a new page</a></li>';
	$mindshareContent .= '<li><a href="edit-pages.php">Edit a page</a></li>';
}
$mindshareContent .= '<li><a href="profile.php">Update your profile or change your password</a></li></ul>';

add_action('admin_head', 'dashboard_start');
}

Executing code outside of a hook in a plugin is a bad idea in a WP plugin, it can lead to all kinda of unexpected results.

Actually, it's not producing a blank page, but an error. I bet you
have WP-Cache activated, which indeed shows blank page instead of
fatal errors, due to its output buffering.

The problem is that current_user_can() relies on wp_get_current_user()
which is a pluggable function, ie functions that are loaded *after*
the plugins.

You need to let everything load first, then test if current user can.
Something like:

<?php
/*
Plugin Name:poop reloaded
*/

function letsdoit() {
	if ( current_user_can('edit_posts') ) {
	       die('OMGKTHXBYE');
	}
}

add_action('init','letsdoit');
?>

Hi all, especially the ? people,

I wonder whether there is a feature in WPMU to enable users to publish
posts per e-mail, just as this is possible in "normal" WordPress. As I
read in the WPMU forums[1], there seems to have been such a feature, but
it appears to be removed.

Now I wonder: Is there actually such a feature? If it was, but is no
longer, why was it removed? Are the MU devs interested in a new
implementation?

Thanks for any enlightenment.

Message-ID: <46E182F3.3050506@yahoo.com>

Hello,

I recently came across http://structuredblogging.org/ and thought is
seemed like a good idea. It promised to do neat things like ping
upcoming.org if you post an event.

The problem is, it doesn't seem to work with the most recent WordPress,
and after a bit of clicking around on the website (and it's broken
links) I'd have to guess that it is no longer maintained.

So really I guess the question is, are there any plugins that do similar
things, like output microformats - or more importantly, ping services
like upcoming.org for events, or ping other servers for other specific
post types?

Any related chatter about microformats in general would be great too,
from my perspective (are they useful, supported, does anyone like the
idea, etc.). :-)

Thanks,

Kevin N.

This fellow is doing something very similar, but a bit more slick than
structured blogging. Maybe chuck in with him and see what can be done.

Message-ID: <00c901c7f17b$ca36d110$5ea47330$@com>

Hey all,

Has anyone came up with a simple way to hide various admin menu items? I
know about Barun's Custom Admin Menu plugin, which is great, but I want to
add the ability to a plugin I am working on without all the extra features
for modifying the menu, etc.

I've seen code like this (from Patrick Khoo) to hide the dashboard, but I
don't really understand how one would modify it to target other menu items:

function dwpage_restrict_adminhead() {
	global $menu;

	if(current_user_can('edit_posts')){
		unset($menu[0]); // hide dashboard
	}
}

add_action('admin_head','dwpage_restrict_adminhead');


It seems like targeting menu items by their index in the menu array would
not be the best way to do this. Also how would you query the $menu array to
see what menu item mapped to what index?


Thanks,

Hi - I still haven't figured out an elegant way to hide menu items but
perhaps some could take a look at what I am trying to do and offer a
suggestion:

--------------

$default_items = array('index.php', 'post-new.php', 'edit.php',
'edit-comments.php', 'link-manager.php', 'themes.php', 'plugins.php',
'users.php', 'options-general.php' );

function mindshare_admin_menu() {
	global $submenu, $menu, $default_items;
	
	for  ($i = 0; $i < count($default_items); $i++) {
		if (locateInMenu($default_items[$i], $menu)) {
			// item was found
			if(!current_user_can('level_10')) {
				unset($menu[0]); // hide the item, not sure
how to target the item
			}
		}
	}
}

function locateInMenu($needle, $haystack) {
	$inMenu = false;
	$x = 0;
	foreach($haystack as $temp) {
		$search = array_search($needle, $temp);
		if (strlen($search) > 0 && $search >= 0) {
			$value[0] = $x;
			$value[1] = $search;
		}
		$x++;
	}
	return $inMenu;
}

add_action('admin_head','mindshare_admin_menu');

--------------

Thank you,

Thanks. :) It was pretty exciting, about 2.2 million pageviews in an 
hour and a half. I'm going to post some graphs later.

Looking at both projects, I can already see the nightmare this will  
create with the teeming WP theme ecosystem.

 From what I see, WP does use microformat in some places (rel for  
category widgets and such), but since each theme has its own take on  
the xhtml presentation layer, these plugins have rough seas ahead of  
them to satisfy their user base.

I use microformats where/whenever I can (hcard, hatom, geotag, etc),  
but at the post and page level in WP, I have found no better way than  
to stick to the theme and template level for now (coupled with custom  
fields too).

Seems rather complicated when Patrick's code would get the job easily done.
:/

Oh, and for reference, open up /wp-admin/menu.php

There's a reason why machine-readable and human-readable content have
been kept separate all these years.... I still haven't found a
convincing reason to not just use <link> tags instead..

The Sandbox and derivatives have good microformats support. Though I
am coding haudio into my record company management plugin, I very much
doubt if even 10% of users will use it. Until the standard browser
public become aware, and microformats are default in major browsers, I
see limited takeup. I see the point from a technical and future proof
side, but not so much for a user experience side.

As for Custom Write panel, it has nothing to do with the theme, but
simply represents the write form in another style, mainly for using
custom fields.

I agree, but you can't have link tags in the body, and it's nice to  
have things like the post authors data wrapped into an hcard for export.

The fastest adoption rate I see are sites like the hcard support in  
Twitter, Flickr, Technorati, etc
FF3 (Gran Paradiso) is just in alpha, but the release schedules calls  
for a code freeze in October 2007 and a first release early November,  
which isn't that far off.

(Aside: what's your record company management plugin? A studio-owning  
friend of mine might be interested)

Ah, but don't these custom fields have to be used at rendering time  
to have any kind of meaningful use?

Its called Ribcage and allows you to content manage the elements
common to any record company eg artists, releases, tracks, and allow
for the streaming of music (m3u, xsfp), downloading of it and
purchasing of it as physical releases over paypal. Multiple file types
for download eg FLAC etc. It is specifically designed for a Creative
Commons based company I am working on called Records On Ribs, but
hopefully eventually it will be able to be used by anyone - single
artists, paid for downloads.

If you want to throw in with the project (this goes for anyone) I
would love it, as my skills aren't incredibly hot and I am stuggling
with doing a good admin interface - I'll set up a Trac etc. Struggling
in particular with allowing uploads easily and zipping files on the
fly. GPLed of course.

I think so yes.

I've set up a SVN/Trac repository for Ribcage - The Wordpress Record
Label Manager. If anyone wants to chip in, let me know either here or
in a private e-mail.

http://tools.assembla.com/svn/ribcage/

Any advice or comment on the non-feature complete code would be very
much appreciated.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Replacing a function in Pluggable.php -
	wp_new_user_notification
Message-ID: <46E2D166.2030506@mysoutham.com>

Hello everyone,

this is my first email to this list, so i apologise if i dont go about 
things correctly.

I have posted this query in the support forums, but havent received any 
replies.

I am trying to write my first plugin to replace the email that is sent 
out to new users using the wp_new_user_notification function. I have 
written the plugin using the devlounge series on writing a plugin, and 
it activates fine, and options are saved to the database. at the moment 
i am concentrating on the body of the email until i know more about what 
i am doing, so there is an admin panel where this is defined.

My problem is that the email text i am trying to define isnt being used, 
and i cant find much documentation on wp_new_user_notification or which 
wp function it hooks into. at the moment it is using user_register, but 
i guessed as to whether it is right or not.

the plugin is as follows

if (!class_exists("NewUserEmailSetUp")) {
   class NewUserEmailSetUp {
       var $adminOptionsName = "NewUserEmailSetUpAdminOptions";
       function NewUserEmailSetUp() { //constructor         }
       function init() {
           $this->getAdminOptions();
       }
       //Returns an array of admin options
       function getAdminOptions() {
           $emailnewuserAdminOptions = array(
               'newuseremailtext' => '',
               'newuseremailsubject' => '',
               'newuseremailfromaddress' => '');
           $emailOptions = get_option($this->adminOptionsName);
           if (!empty($emailOptions)) {
               foreach ($emailOptions as $key => $option)
                   $emailnewuserAdminOptions[$key] = $option;
           }                          
update_option($this->adminOptionsName, $emailnewuserAdminOptions);
           return $emailnewuserAdminOptions;
       }
       function wp_new_user_notification($user_id, $plaintext_pass = '') {
   $user = new WP_User($user_id);

   $user_login = stripslashes($user->user_login);
   $user_email = stripslashes($user->user_email);

   $message  = sprintf(__('New user registration on your blog %s:'), 
get_option('blogname')) . "\r\n\r\n";
   $message .= sprintf(__('Username: %s'), $user_login) . "\r\n\r\n";
   $message .= sprintf(__('E-mail: %s'), $user_email) . "\r\n";

   @wp_mail(get_option('admin_email'), sprintf(__('[%s] New User 
Registration'), get_option('blogname')), $message);

   if ( empty($plaintext_pass) )
       return;
   $message  = sprintf(__('Hi %s'), $user_login) . "\r\n";
   $message .= $emailOptions("newuseremailtext") . "\r\n";
   $message .= sprintf(__('Username: %s'), $user_login) . "\r\n";
   $message .= sprintf(__('Password: %s'), $plaintext_pass) . "\r\n";

   wp_mail($user_email, sprintf(__('[%s] Welcome to my test blog'), 
get_option('blogname')), $message);
}
       //Prints out the admin page
       function printAdminPage() {
                   $emailOptions = $this->getAdminOptions();
                                                         if

Subject: [wp-hackers] Clarification of wp-includes/class folder
Message-ID: <46E32390.7040701@dragonu.net>

The last time I bought this up, it was well received, or so I thought. 
However, the bug and patches on Trac were not. 
<http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4899>.

It is against my religion to willfully add a closing PHP tag to a class 
file. I'm a firm believer of this religion. Since it is a coding 
standard, I will add them. However this ticket should be looked at. 
<http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/4901/cleantrailingspaces.diff> 
for a list of potential files which may give problems in some edge 
cases. The main area of concern is wp-includes/*.php.

A few points bought up in the ticket:

1. Class Folder name
2. Small amount of classes

Rest of the discussion was on the lack of closing PHP tag.

I however gave four justification points. Not to say that at least a few 
of them can easily be crushed with a good argument, but it would at 
least allow me to better explain my thoughts.

   1. Allows for Classes to be Unit Tested easily. Some classes are
      within files that contain presentation, which doesn't easily allow
      for unit testing the class.
   2. Single location to find classes, moves classes that are within
      other files into a location where developers and plug in authors
      can find them. Intuitive locations.
   3. Submitting Patches for classes should allow for better versioning.
   4. Possible optimization by only including the classes that are
      needed. (Think Administration or installer)

The main justification is that moving forward, PHP 4 will be left 
behind, eventually at some point and __autoload will be of some use. 
Whether or not it is a dirty hack is irrelevant. Providing for this and 
following the PEAR class folder scheme, I've found is a lot easier to 
find classes, since the folder scheme is directly related to the class 
name. In wp-classes.php, you should expect to find all WordPress 
classes, but not so. WP_Rewrite is in rewrite.php. If you are lucky, 
you'll only have to look once, if you are unlikely you would have to 
look at two places. However, without looking at the codex, where would 
you expect to find WP_Ajax_Response? wp-classes.php perhaps? I've found 
it once, and even now I have no idea. *I should know where to look the 
first time, than constantly searching.*

On the name of the folder, wp-includes/class is just my preference for 
the patches. It can be whatever. I will however debate my reasoning for 
using that folder name.

1. wp-includes/classes/WP/Cache.php
2. wp-includes/class/WP/Cache.php

Looking at it, it seemed intuitive, since I'll want to be including a 
single class, named WP_Cache. However, thinking as the folder is holding 
many classes, wp-includes/classes/ would make more sense. Whatever. I'll 
just be happy with having a folder for classes.

For the second point against this setup, what happens at which point 
when WordPress does get even more classes and the discussion comes up 
again? "We shouldn't do that since we have too many classes and it would 
be too much work to move the classes." Now is the best time, as it 
allows for the most forward outlook and minimal work.

I'm sure that once this is set in place that many people would be on 
board, since its advantages have to be seen for themselves. However, 
seeing classes in many different places is madness. Why wp-includes 
exists and yet there are functions and classes in other base files and 
in the wp-admin is beyond me. It is a disadvantage and causes more 
headaches to developers looking to extend WordPress and in some classes 
causes extra work since the functions would have to be rewritten since 
the file its in has output that would need to be captured.

I would recommend that all functions and classes be, at the very least 
and if we can agree on anything, in wp-includes.

Subject: [wp-hackers] "content_filtered_save_pre" filter?
Message-ID: <8f93a7390709081635n4d26f579o375ba8b47c43f1c@mail.gmail.com>

I want to filter the post before it's inserted into the database (reverse
some changes TinyMCE makes).

According to http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference ,
"content_filtered_save_pre" appears to be what I want. However, when I do
this code:

add_filter( 'content_filtered_save_pre', 'var_dump' );

NULL is outputted, i.e. nothing is being passed to it. I'm using the latest
SVN.

"content_save_pre" gets some data, but it's the raw $_POST with slashes
added before quotes and such.

Any ideas?

I don't know anything about any broken filters but you mentioned tinymce, so...

If you just want to change the way tinymce behaves, the more direct
way would be to alter the tinymce config or write your own replacement
functions in js. The hooks for this are in tiny_mce_config.php.

Cheers,
Andy

No, no, I know how to do all of that (I have another plugin that adds some
buttons to TinyMCE).

This plugin is for posting code and TinyMCE does < to &lt; which I don't
want inside of the plugin's code blocks. I need to reverse that in certain
places. I can't do it on output as I have no way of knowing then if the post
was written in TinyMCE or not.

If push comes to shove, I can use "content_save_pre", but that's on the back
burner for the moment.

You know what, gimme a day or two, and I'll get back to you on that.
I'm not sure I have time right now (maybe I'll get tempted ;) but let  
me see if my friend is interested in helping out.

PS: if you want to see some code that might help you out, you could  
check out my old web-based streaming jukebox project and take some of  
the bits you need (GPL).

http://sourceforge.net/projects/netjuke

The above site and source is historical only, since the codebase has  
been merged into the Jinzora project in 2003, but there might be some  
nuggets you can use.

We'll go off thread for the rest since we're a bit off topic now. :)

The project looks smart, as does Jinzora. The code in Ribcage for
streaming, as you can see on the Trac, is fairly minimal. All it does
it print templates of the various stream types and force a browser to
download them. Works though...

In 2.3, everything gets run through
sanitize_post()/sanitize_post_field(). pre_post_content_filtered and
content_filtered_save_pre filters should both be issued. I'm not sure
why those wouldn't be working.

I wrote a post and added

add_filter( 'pre_post_content_filtered', 'var_dump' );

to my plugin and after hitting publish, it outputted

string(0) ""

and then a cannot modify headers warning (expected).

Ugh.

WP does nothing with that field by default.  Unless you're putting
stuff in it, it should be blank.

Oh, well then what should I use to modify a post's contents before it's put
into the database, post-filtering (i.e. removal of slashes and such) ?

Message-ID: <26A393AE-3582-406E-92C6-0B87F7856190@pixline.net>

I wrote a plugin [1] that needs a little template modification in  
order to work. But I have seen in the last two months that quite 9/10  
of potential users have troubles in doing this little modification [2].
As long as I know, there's no hook available to make what this plugin  
is supposed to do (replace 'archive for category x' h2 with a page  
content, like a longer introduction to your category archives).

My questions:
1) Am I missing some hooks, and there's a better way to do what I'm  
trying to do?
2) If not, this is worth a new hook proposal, and do you think this  
hook would be acceptable?

I'm really confused...
Thank you!

Paolo,

You could try output buffering [1] with a preg_replace for something
like '/<h2>Archive for category.*?<\/h2>/i' (although that's off the
top of my head so is probably wrong). Not sure how this would affect a
blog's performance so you'd have to look into that.

HTH, John.

I'm very familiar with the problem that users are unable or unwilling to
do certain modifications to their templates. But if it is a template
issue, there's no way around it.

The problem in your case is that this text "archive for ..." does vary
very much across themes. Some themes will have similar phrase, others
are translated, some may even lack that section.

Yes, you could replace the section (as already proposed) by buffering
and regexing, but you will not be able to solve this automatically *and*
in a clean manner.

As for a hook, what sort of hook should that be? There are only very few
and generic hooks in the templates (like wp_head, wp_meta, wp_footer),
and with good reasons. A hook to print a single, template-related
section doesn't make sense.

I'm afraid you and your users will have to live with the necessity of
editing the template files.

Alex

Hey Alex,

I think the problem is a PHP issue. You've defined the function 
wp_new_user_notification() as a method of the class NewUserEmailSetUp. I 
think if you move the function definition outside the class, and wrap it 
in a if(!function_exists('wp_new_user_notification')) { }, then it 
should work.

I've attached what I mean, I think it should work, but I haven't tested it.

Cheers,


Callum.

Hi Callum,

Thanks very much for the reply, i appreciate it.

I tried what you suggested, despite not seeing anything attached as an 
example  ;-) . but what happens now is that i register, and instead of 
being redirected to the login page, i just stay at a blank page, and no 
email is sent at all. I dont understand this as the original function 
doesnt have anything to do with a redirect.

I have had a look at the themed login/register plugin by James Kelly 
(http://www.jameskelly.org/wordpress-plugins/custom-login-and-registration-forms-plugin/ 
) and stripped it down until only the functions that the plugin needed 
to send the email were left, and then ive compared that to my plugin. 
The only differences are that i am storing the options in an array, as 
opposed to each option in a separate field on the database.

I'd like to see your example, and any further help greatly appreciated.

thanks again,

Alex

I haven't followed this thread closely, but I think this sounds like a 
PHP error. You may want to check your PHP log file to see if any error 
is output there. If there is an error in a function before the page 
content is generated and if outputting errors to the screen is switched 
off in your php.ini, you would get a blank page upon calling this function.

Ok, just a guess, but sounds like it. ;-)

Greetings,
Johannes

There's something very interesting that vBulletin and some other
systems do: global theme string variables.

Basically its a list of every string you'd encounter, propogated with
the defaults for English. It's theme independant, you plugins can add
their own variables to the list.

It doesn't require a full-fledged theming engine, I think it just runs
all the PHP templates through a state machine or a regex converter
that does what's needed.

It's a lot easier to say:
'Go to WP-Admin, Select Theme Variables, and change "foo" to "bar"'
than
'Load the template modification page in the WP dashboard. Open the
template "single.php" for the theme you want to use. Go through the
billions of lines of code and find something that just *might* maybe
look possibly somewhat like "foo" and change it to "foo %25bar%" then
hit the save button. If you fsck everything up, FTP into your server
and replace it with the stock file from your theme and rinse and
repeat.'

As far as coding is concerned, it's really no biggie. It doesn't
require a real theme engine, it doesn't take much on theme developers
behalf (and simplifies quite a bit, replacing the billions of
print_f() with %varname%), etc.

And even once you use a variable-based system you won't even *need* to
ask the users to change anything, because you can use a simple hook or
two to change the contents of the variables automatically.

It would be backwards-compatible with the old theme system (since the
only difference is, technically, a new hook in the form of %varname%)
.

The only issue for consideration is performance. Assuming the variable
map is stored in the database, you'd probably need a
performance-efficient (read-only?) way of accessing it, such as a
mysql MEMORY table.

Of course all this could be just mad ravings, but I think it has
potential and could help address some of these issues and then
some................................................

Just my two cents,
CG

Subject: [wp-hackers] API wishlist for Plugins
Message-ID: <B7A8E110-F87D-4FB5-8F66-B48587DA3E4E@joostdevalk.nl>

Hi,

I would like an API (SOAP or REST or something like that) to:

- get the number of downloads for a certain plugin:
	- for the last day;
	- for the last week;
	- for the last month;
	- for all time;

- get the latest download URL for a plugin, to use in pages outside  
of WordPress.org (thing to check: are downloads tracked by opening a  
URL, or by an onclick action?).

- get the latest version for a plugin.

Would that be possible?

Cheers,
Joost

More than one solution that doesn't involving microformats.

1) Add content buffering support to WP, either via a plugin or to the
core. Then you can add whatever you want when you want.
2) Use JS to add what you need to the head tag (quirky, not a good idea)
3) Add hooks to WP for retreiving the necessary info (if they're not
already there), add a plugin to reteirev that info, and add a call to
that plugin in the header template...

maybe there is something I'm missing, but that should work... i think.

Hey Alex,

I think Johannes is right, I think there's probably a PHP error.

I think the list strips off attachments (I checked and I did remember to 
attach it!), so I've pastebined it here http://pastebin.com/m6cb3d895

Cheers,

Your not missing any hooks.  You have done the correct thing in creating
a new template tag.

We can't add hooks everywhere in the templates as it is very hard to
ensure that they will be there (most templates are custom after all)
therefore you create template tags.

- From a quick read of the two links I think what your missing is good
documentation.  This is always the hardest thing to write!

It seems that a common misunderstanding is that people think your plugin
provides a way to designate a page as a category archive.

So I think you may need to improve that info.

What I have found works well [1] is to structure the documentation in a
question and answer form e.g. Answer the following questions:

1. What it does.
2. How it works.
3. How to use it.
4. What it requires.
5. How to install it.

Sometimes the info provide is still not enough - I need to update this
description [2] to include some sample code to make it clear how to use
the plugin.

I hope this helps.

If you know the Slug, and you want it for anytime thats displayed on the Stat chart:
http://wordpress.org/extend/stats/plugin-xml.php?slug=<Slug>

Once again, If you know the Slug, this should point to the latest: (Tagged 0.5 releases are <slug.0.5.zip i think)
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/<Slug>.zip

> - get the latest version for a plugin.

You'll be interested in the api for wordpress.org which isnt documentated AFAIK
Check out: http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/includes/update.php#L43
You'll have to do some digging i think (It shouldnt be too hard to work out the structure from that code + a few Echo/print_r statements)


It would probably be nice for all that to be wrapped up into the api.wordpress.org with some documentation though.

Message-ID: <8f93a7390709091736l35e95230x62d559132dc5e788@mail.gmail.com>

After I saw Matt's post on WP.com (
http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/09/03/posting-source-code/ ), I jumped the
gun and threw together a plugin to replicate that for us running self-hosted
blogs.

Matt saw my post to wp-hackers and replied that we should combine our
efforts:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014324.html

He pastebin'ed me his code and boy am I glad he did. My plugin was missing a
lot, but also featured some things his was missing. You know the saying --
two heads are better than one. ;)

Anyway, I've tested it with both TinyMCE and without and it seems to work
great, but I wanted some more testing from you guys before I put my "done"
mark on it.

You can check out a copy via SVN if you'd like:
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/syntaxhighlighter/trunk

Feedback appreciated.

I tried it out, seems to work perfectly. Although, maybe you could also use:

[source lang='php']...[/source]

Also, so it's even easier.

There's sorta a bug with the copy to clipboard feature in IE7 though (I
don't know if it's possible to fix, though). When you click the copy to
clipboard link, IE7 asks you if you would like to allow the page to copy the
text to the clipboard, but if you click don't allow, you still get the alert
box saying that the text has been copied to the clipboard.

Also, what's with the question mark that opens an "About box"? Something
from the syntax highlighter, I'm guessing?

I know that the syntax highlighter I was using before (WP-Syntax[1]) used
GeSHi[2], have you looked at that? I'm just saying because it supports more
languages...

Overall, it's awesome! It's going to make posting code easier and it'll look
better.

Me too, I'm getting sick of those code snippets messed up every time  
I edit something with Safari :-)

Looks like it does [source and lang already. It didn't at first, but I did
an update from svn, and it works now. Thanks.

hmm, sounds like code snippet 2 only this one apparently works on the
client side.

Although GeSHi is server-side... Anyways, what it uses now is good.

Yeah, I meant to add that one, but forgot during regex testing. I added it
shortly after posting to the list. Update your SVN copy. ;)

As for the copy thing, that's not my code. That's the Javascript package and
I'm not sure if it's avoidable or not. It sends a copy-to-clipboard command
(which IE prompts) and then does an alert() assuming it worked. Perhaps it
needs to check the clipboard to see if it matches. Then again, that'll
probably trigger an IE prompt too, heh.

As for GeSHi, that's server side. This plugin relies entirely on Javascript
to do the highlighting and box. It makes it much easier to be honest, plus
it works better for text readers.

I prefer the styling of Alex G.'s, plus that one is server side too.

IE will only display the prompt once per page view. So, if you say allow,
then it will be copied to your clipboard and then you could check if it
matches without another prompt. If you say don't allow, then it won't be
copied to your clipboard and nothing will be returned with the check and
another prompt will not be displayed.

stristr() does exist in PHP 4, so you can get rid of the check and the
duplicate ones using strstr().

Loving it :)

I had a small bit of trouble with the CSS not overriding "hard" enough, 
I've added a diff with the fix for it to this message.

Two other small things:
- there's a space between the < and the ? of each PHP tag, no matter if 
I choose PHP or HTML, is that fixable? It breaks copy pasting as well.
- is it possible to have the color of the left border configurable?

Joost

One of the problems I've been trying to pin down is formatting of  
source code.  If someone pastes a chunk of code in there it is  
usually indented to various levels.  At this point TinyMCE will  
always remove those.

One way to get around that is for the author to mark it as pre- 
formatted.  Have you found a way to preserve spaces without having to  
set pre-formatted?

1. How does it make it easier? I use WP-Syntax and just add wrappers
around my code that look like <pre lang="php">...</pre> and it just
works. I don't see that that is any easier to do than add [sourcecode]
wrappers. As far as implementation, you upload the plugin and activate
it. Can't get much simpler.

2. WP-Syntax generates completely valid XHTML and CSS for the code,
any text reader will read it just fine.

3. Using a server side system like GeSHi seems like a better solution
to me. For one thing, you don't have the page render the code first in
plain ugly black text and then suddenly have it jump to nice and
colored once the javascript kicks in.

I gotta say that while this is an interesting approach, the server
side approach is a better one which just makes more sense. So I'll
stick to WP-Syntax.

I'm not able to replicate that plugin in either the good editor or TinyMCE.

As for the coloring, just edit the stylesheet.

Nope, I don't use or can stand TinyMCE. Heck, I usually delete it from the
WordPress install folder before even uploading it to a server.

1. I've had bad experiences with other server side highlighting plugins for
WordPress before. They often get manged by WordPress. That one sounds decent
though, minus the "lang" attribute (then again, this one is forced to use
"name" due to the JS package). To be honest though, I'd probably have used
server side highlighting as well if I had been starting from scratch and not
just overhauling an existing plugin.

2. Oh.

3. Get a faster browser / see #1.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Current page and category parents,
	in wp-includes/classes.php
Message-ID: <46E6C4F9.8070901@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I've added a patch to trac ticket 2395[1] to recursively add 
class="current_page_parent" or class="current-cat-parent" to all parents 
(including grandparents, great-grandparents, etc).

I've also added a second patch which includes the above and also adds a 
new class="current_page_parent_lN" and class="current-cat-parent-lN" 
where N is the number of levels above the current page, from 0 upwards. 
For example, current_page_parent_l0 means the current page, 
current-cat-parent-l1 means the current category's parent, 
current_page_parent_l2 means the current page's grandparent, and so on.

I'd like to propose changing the milestone for this ticket to 2.4 seeing 
as there is now a patch available. If I don't hear any objections over 
the next few days I'll go ahead and do that in trac.

I'd welcome any feedback / comments / suggestions on the patch.

Cheers - Callum.

I think he meant from a developer's point of view.  Also, I tried that
plugin and I had problems.  I did like that the syntax let you disable
the plugin and it looked "okay" in the browser...but this plugin has
that potential as well...

The JavaScript SyntaxHighliter doesn't generate correct XHTML, so that
*is* a problem.

I wouldn't mind the server side approach if it could be cached, but
running GeSHi everytime gets expensive for anything more than small
snippets.  And I do like the ability to server the unformatted
version, etc.

Yes, sadly the JS package requires invalid HTML and I don't know Javascript
well enough to modify it.

There's a ticket open on the matter as well:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using the page_options field to create custom options
	pages
Message-ID: <46E728F2.8000808@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I've just added an article to the codex about creating new options pages 
based on a technique I discovered a few days ago.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Options_Pages

I found that if you set the form action to options.php and create a 
hidden field called page_options with a comma separated list of the 
fields on the page that should be mapped to options, WordPress will 
handle all the saving / redirection / permissions / etc for you.

If I've missed anything or there's any errors, please let me know. Any 
feedback would be most welcome.

Cheers,


Callum.

Message-ID: <8f93a7390709111705g31a55fd9ga1c851913ded669c@mail.gmail.com>

My web admin buddy who helps me run the server all my WordPress sites are
has set up Squid due to the traffic one of my sites gets (no, not my
personal blog sadly). I already run WP-Cache on it, but during peak times,
the server bogs down and becomes a tad slow.

However, he says WordPress (well, more likely WP-Cache) isn't sending a 304
header when the page hasn't been modified. Is all I need to do to fix this
is send a 304 via header() right before this line in wp-cache-phase-1.php ?

if ($meta->dynamic) {

i.e. this:

header( 'HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified' );
if ($meta->dynamic) {


Anyone knowledgeable care to weigh in?

I'm running WP 2.2.3 on this particular install.

Oh that is cool, thanks!

Off the top of your head, do you remember if that saving had  
sanitazation too?

re: what needs be done to get it there?
Get me an iPhone and I'll roll it out. :p
Kidding. I'm in Canada anyway... :(

But on a more serious note, one more question would be how much of  
the admin is a good target to aim for to start with?

The article mentions that the guy went on to make alternate templates  
for the whole admin, which is obviously quite a lot of work in itself  
(I think he's a paid employee).

 From what I see (please correct me if I'm wrong), WP does not allow  
for templating of the admin.
This said, a plugin could easily point all iPhone/mobile based logins  
to an alternate admin interface in WP, which has the advantage to let  
the dev community start with the most desirable core functions anyone  
would really be interested in using from a mobile browser (post,  
etc), and phase in the rest of the admin as time goes (presentation,  
etc). I'd venture this would make it more realistic if taken from a  
community development approach. That's if Automattic doesn't put some  
paid resources behind it, which would be an ideal scenario.

The UI component in the MT plugin is itself derived from a plugin for  
TypePad (also by a paid employee), so there's a precedent for  
emulating that part. I'm not sure if the two plugins use it, but iUI  
makes replicating the iPhone interface a breeze: <http://

PS: Also, I'm assuming that although it's not meant for the iPhone's  
resolution, the default WP admin layout should work quite fine in the  
standard web mode, especially in wide-screen mode (480 x 320) and  
coupled with zooming.

Check it out with iPhoney (allows rotate, but no zooming)

Scratch that question, I looked it up in /wp-admin/options.php.
It does.

And one more for the road.

It actually doesn't really... (although that depends on how secure  
you wanna be).

sanitize_option() will only run stripslashes on custom options.

I'd probably make a note of that in the codex page.

Not the ultimate authority but it looks right to me.
Having done the equivalent with memcache in other systems, it works  
well.

For debugging purposes, LiveHTTPHeaders in Firefox is a great tool.

Yes, there are whole admin skins out there, but what they do is just load in
their own stylesheet. While it's not as flexible as a whole templating
system (side note: true admin themes in 2.4 would be nice), you can still do
quite a bit just via CSS.

I think beside 304, it will be better if you send other information such as,

e.g.

   header( "HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified" );
   header( "Cache-Control: public" ); // can be cached by share cache,
e.g. Squid
   header( "Last-Modified: Thu, 02 Mar 2005 07:30:00 GMT" ); //
replace with cache generation time

Sending that header there ended up making the site serve a
application/octet-stream if you refreshed too fast.

We decided it wasn't worth the trouble and just enabled memcaching + sql
caching. We also put a redirect to Coral in the .htaccess (commented out)
just incase on those hard hitting days. We'll see how it goes soon (our
traffic is uneven -- we essentially get slashdotted once a week and only in
certain months).

Oh, and here's the site in question if anyone needs the URL:
http://www.finalgear.com/   (fansite for some TV shows, hence the spikes
when they air)

And the application/octet-stream issue isn't Squid related as it was
happening on both the regular port and the Squid port (for testing).

You wouldn't actually need an iPhone to completely test this out, an iPod
touch hooked up to some Wireless Internet would work just fine. :P

An awesome example of a iPhone page is Facebook:

http://iphone.facebook.com/

Just go to it in FireFox or Safari (for Windows works fine).

I don't have an iPhone (I also live in Canada), but I think that would look
sweet on one.

Good point. But w/ 3 kids and working for a university, the nano and  
begging on the wp-hackers list is all I can afford. ;)

Yeah, FB pulled it off quite nicely. My coworker came running in my  
office the second it hit the streets. :)

A friend of mine, Joe, got himself a free iPhone from Kevin Rose for  
developing one for Digg.
http://digg.com/iphone
http://blog.digg.com/?p=86

The worst part: Apple is about to open a store a couple of blocks  
away from my office...
Temptation... Bah, my kids don;t need to eat anyway, right?

iPhoney.app (mac) is pretty nice too, because it emulates the  
rotation, scales the page as the iPhone does, and sets the proper  
user-agent.
I'm sure one for windows will popup (or as an Adobe Apollo .air app  
since the latter also runs webkit).

hmm, maybe you can send the header for text/html BEFORE you send the 304?

Hmm, my guess from what WordPress does internally is header('HTTP/1.1 
304 Not Modified', true);

As for sending 'Content-Type: text/html' before HTTP/1.1, is a violation 
of HTTP protocol. The HTTP/1.1 is the response header and must be first.

Basically, my guess is that you aren't overriding the first line which 
might be HTTP/11. 200 Success or something.

Hey Stephane,

I'm assuming the options are parsed in the same way that standard 
options are parsed, aren't they? Do you think extra security is 
required? Feel free to add some notes to the Wiki, I'm not 100% clear on 
what you mean.

Cheers - Callum.

The standard WP way, yes.

It's usually good enough for me for simple plugins, but when I write  
plugins that are tied to security (like my wpDirAuth LDAP plugin),  
I'm a bit more anal and pass integers through intval(), all the  
fields that do no require HTML through strip_tags(), and so on. If  
nothing else, my user base expects it and are prompt to remind me if  
not done. ;)

Subject: [wp-hackers] adding delete/autoload to options.php
Message-ID: <op.tyjhnprck6w4mc@dd32.no-ip.com>

I had a thought today about the options.php thats been mentioned a lot recently, and i thought i might share it and see what peoples thoughts on the topic would be.

Currently options.php allows you to edit the value of simple strings, thats nice and all, But what I'd like to do is be able to delete a option, or toggle its autoload functionality.

Now, Deleting, I realise that someone who doesn't know what they're doing could cause havoc with that, but they can do the same if they modify the value to an unexpected value, Many plugins don't clean up the options when removed, and some users i know end up with a couple of thousand options(Those who like to tinker with many plugins..)
Perhaps a button, or check-box?

Toggling the autoload flag, At present the only way to set that is when adding the option, or by doing a direct SQL Query, Maybe adding a update_option_autoload, or adding a 3rd param to update_option?
Users might also find it useful to be able to toggle that autoload function from the options.php file, Now, if they were to set all options as no autoload, then that could cause performance issues, But I'm thinking that most people who access the options.php page are more advanced than the majority of WP users, so thats not a great issue.

Thoughts? Comments?

I've already coded up some of it locally for quicker delete-option access, but I'd like more input from the WP devs before i clean it up and submit a Trac Ticket if anyones interested.

Good thinking and that did indeed output a blank page, but what's weird is
that my code is right below other header()'s and right above any
include()'s. Very weird.

But oh well, as said earlier, he ended up deciding Squid wasn't worth the
trouble (thank goodness) and opted for lighter caching methods.

I guess sanitize_option should have a hook in the default case which
passes the value on to other code to be sanitized.
e.g.

$value = apply_filters("sanitize_option_{$option}", $option, $value);

That would allow plugins to use options.php and do custom sanitization.

I tried it[1] too, but ended up giving it up, opting to spend a few
hours getting eAccelerator to compile, rather than spend any more weeks
hacking on Squid. I checked the headers, but no matter what I did,
anything served from PHP would MISS the cache.

The lack of an intuitive Squid configuration format didn't help, either.

Deleting is quite a problem as you don't want to lose settings just 
because you deactivated the plugin. What I did is to use 
plugin_name_setting and delete all plugin_name_ settings if uninstall is 
set up. Therefore there should be some thing be done on how plugins are 
managed. Other systems (e.g. Typo3) make a difference between installing 
and activating. I think it should be done. There still should be the 
activation/deactivation hooks in case your messing around and something 
will break if you get deactivated. But especially having a uninstall 
hook would save you us plugin-developer a lot of trouble. And being able 
to output errors on those hooks.

Cheers

I agree with Morty.

I also think it would be useful to have the option to delete in the 
options.php page. Given that there's no link to the options page, it's 
unlikely users will "stumble" upon it and delete options by accident.

I'd support implementing these changes into core.

Cheers - Callum.

I'll send an 8gb iPhone (or iPod Touch, winner's choice) to whoever 
builds the best iPhone interface plugin. If it's a team effort each 
person can get one.

Sounds reasonable for 2.4. Triple-check all the code to make sure it's 
nonced up and everything so we don't create any holes.

Maybe make this bounty public on Wordpress.org, to encourage the
broader development community. I am pretty sure that this can be
rustled up within a few days.

If someone wants to blog it that's fine, but I'd rather give a head 
start and preference to people on wp-hackers. :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Add_Submenu_Page Q's
Message-ID: <002401c7f580$0b97b860$22c72920$@com>

Forgive me if this topic has been discussed previously, but I am struggling
to get it to work and couldn't find anything via Google which helped me.

 

I am working on a WP plugin which will be used to manage our Swim Team.  I
want to create a new Top Level Admin Menu and then 3-5 submenus underneath
it.  From the Wordpress Codex
(http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus) it would appear it
is pretty straight forward but I can't get the example to work.

 

Is there something wrong with the example?  Is there some secret to it?  I
saw one blurb somewhere which mentioned the sub menu items  should be
created prior to creating the top level menu but even rearranging the
example didn't yield any new submenus.

 

Thanks,

 

Mike

Yes, actually.

Instead of this:

> add_menu_page('Test Toplevel', 'Test Toplevel', 8, 'testtoplevel',  
> 'mt_toplevel_page');

Do this:

> add_menu_page('Test Toplevel', 'Test Toplevel', 8, __FILE__,  
> 'mt_toplevel_page');

Passing a string doesn't work for top-level menus.

Hey Mike,

The example is correct as far as I can see. Can you pastebin [1] the
code you're using so someone can take a look at it and see where you
might be going wrong?

Good thing I didn't start writing a theme earlier. ;)
Doug:
I'm working on a theme right now that will be independent of the main theme
and will use browser detection to change the ui while browsing on an iPhone.
After the release, I'll hopefully get around to writing a backend iPhone
theme, which well be more difficult, but this is all going to be written on
time that I don't have so if someone beats me to it I'll be happy to
contribute.

Dagnabit. You couldn't have waited until the 21st, when I'm on

Now someone else is gonna beat me to it... :p

I don't have the time to do it on my own at this very time, but if a

Okay, let's get the ball rolling.

Anyone has a better name than iWP for me to submit a Plugin Repo  
request for the plugin?

I know it sounds superfluous to think about the name first, but so  
much is tied to it,  think it's a good first step.

[sorry for the staggered messaging, posting in between the countless  
"daddy" requests from the kids :)]

Furthermore, does anyone disagree with the modular development I  
suggested?
IE: start with the most desirable features, then expeand it over time.

And the next logical question: what are these most desirable features.

I'd venture:
- mini dashboard
- post listing
- post add/edit
- recent comments listing
- comment moderation/edit

Does anyone sees page add/edit/list as a must have in "v1"?

Do we think we need to have all of the post add/edit options, or can  
we omit some (at least at the beginning), such as the file upload  
(unlikely from a mobile platform) and custom fields. I see the file  
upload as a candidate for v1, but only if someone can advise of how  
realistic/complicated/desirable it is to upload picts taken from the  
iPhone built-in cam. Does the email blogging support this (haven;t  
tried that feature yet)?

An iPhone-specific UI is very exciting and all, but how about one that
supports mobile phones in general?  Or is this a one-off?

The unfortunate thing though in WP's plugins context, when plugins are 'uninstalled' the plugins are no longer available to run uninstall hooks, So that rules that out, Which is why i'm suggesting we put a delete button(Or checkbox) on the special /wp-admin/options.php page.

I'd like to with my plugins when its de-activated set the plugins options to autoload=no, as the data the plugin needs is a fair ammount of serialised data, i just dont see why those options should continue to be loaded after a deactivation.. I could do a raw SQL, but IMHO we should never have to do a raw query since theres a option api.

Well seems to be a +1 from everyone, so i'll do it sometime over the next few weeks when i've got some decent time to triple-check everything.

I think it can be either. I always develop with standards in  
accessibility in mind.

The hidden goal of the plugin is really to have an admin lite.

The CSS/JS level presentation can enhance/customize the user  
experience based on the browser's capability, but should never make  
the core functionality.

Therefore, you end up with a light interface than can probably be  
accessed from a POS like my Motorola v551 (pre-RAZR) by being served  
an even lighter stylesheet and no JS (ignored), an iPhone/Pod using  
iUI (very specific user-agent), another webkit-based device, a  
Blackberry, etc.

But I do think the immediate goal is the iPhone/Pod, given the cool  
factor and the us-too factor which WP can only benefit from (or  
rather suffer from if not tackled).

I'd suggest going with a minimalist interface that's functional (at least
the basics as outlined by Stephane) and more friendly in general to all
mobile devices.

Then a layer on top of that that adds CSS (and script if necessary /
valuable) for specific devices by user agent, with the iPhone being the
first such "skin".

I would eliminate the feeds from the dashboard and give only admin
stuff - recent comments, moderation queue, etc., then links to Write
Post, Write Page

I wouldn't waste real estate on a full menu bar -- plugins, themes,
options, blogroll seem unnecessary.

If we could get an upload screen that was compatible with the iPhone's
camera, that'd be pretty slick...

(Er, sorry for the double post.)

And if anyone wants to team up with me to do this, I'm more than happy. I'm
a code monkey, so making the interface shouldn't be a problem, but I'm
really iffy about the design aspect and my skills in that department...

You might be interested in Operas "Small Screen" functionality in the desktop browser,
They use the same processing core in the Opera Mini(The web browser on mobile/other portable devices) as the desktop, and the small sreen functionality is supposed to provide a pretty good developing platform for mobile interfaces.
(It'll also show how much stuff you need to go through to get to useful parts in the current web interface with a mobile, Opera 9.5(alpha) doesnt seem to like inline JS in Small screen mode, not sure what 9.23 is like with it)

320 x 480 (portrait) 480 x 320 (landscape), but I'd like to know how  
much usable space since I'd personally be coding "blindly" (ie: no  
real mean to preview, which is the conundrum in my case).

re: other platforms:
I'd suggest tackling one thing at a time.
Keeping the portability factor in mind for the architecture, but  
focusing on the existing challenge for v1, which is a nice iPhone/Pod  
interface while trying hard to lock ourselves in. This is mainly to  
keep with the release early, release often motto. If we get something  
targeted out, we can then gather more feedback and crank the features  
out right after.

On this, I'm off to do some research.

A lot of "for iPhone" sites *don't* do so well in other devices  
because they count on iPhone-level JS support and MobileSafari- 
specific features.  Heck, most "for iPhone" sites don't work on  
Desktop Safari or Firefox.  Would be nice for people to develop sites  
that work well on all mobile devices (iPhone/iPod Touch included),  
and not just sites that emulate the iPhone interface.  Because no  
matter how popular those Apple devices become, it's still a very  
small portion of the mobile universe.

Viper or anyone else interested in developing:
If you want to go in the direction I'm heading, I'll be more then
happy to open up some SVN accounts and we can start hacking away.
http://svn.scatter3d.com/iphone-theme/
http://iphone-theme.scatter3d.com:3000/browser

Right now I'm using iUI,
http://code.google.com/p/iui/
and I have a test site here,
http://www.scatter3d.com/iphone-wp/

How it works:
I have a plugin that will switch the sites's theme to an special
iPhone theme in your wp-content/themes directory, only if the reader
is coming in from an iPhone of course. If you go there now without an
iPhone you'll see kubrick.
There's definitely a lot to do; iUI isn't working out so well as a
base so I need to heavily modify it to get it to work here.

To answer your questions about development:
iPhoney (http://www.marketcircle.com/iphoney/) let's you see what the
site will look like in your development. however, it doesn't spoof the
user agent :(.

Once you start implementing this it get's complicated, because you have
an option which starts working when to a totally different time: The
user activates uninstall (accidentally) and half a year later he
deactivates the plugin and wonders why all his settings are gone. And
then it's the plugin dev's fault.
IMO a nicer solutions might be to deactivate the registrations of all
hooks but uninstall. This should be quite easy backing the hook-table up
before you include the file, then include it, call all uninstall hooks,
restore the hooks and you're done. Nice and clean.

> I'd like to with my plugins when its de-activated set the plugins options to autoload=no, as the data the plugin needs is a fair ammount of serialised data, i just dont see why those options should continue to be loaded after a deactivation.. I could do a raw SQL, but IMHO we should never have to do a raw query since theres a option api.

Sound's reasonalbe to me although I don't think you will be able to
measure a difference in performance whether you load 50 oder 300
settings. But again this get's more complicated once you look at it
closely. To make this simple - otherwise pluindevs won't use it - you
have to have somthing like decativate_options_prefix() do deactivate all
options with a prefix. Thinking of activate_options_prefix you will
notice that that the plugin might not want to have all options
autoloaded. So you would need to add an "default load" to the options table.
Thinking of it, I think it's worth it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] post relaetd events
Message-ID: <46E93AA3.5050809@yadan.net>

Hi,

I am trying to figure out if I can get events for the following things:

1. new post published for the first time.

2. post title changes (I can live with some kind of "post changed"
event, it doesn't have to be that specific).

[gonna try hard to not sound like a snub pr*ck, 'coz I kinda hate  
having to say the following, but it makes sense]

Hey Matt,

Sorry, we weren't ignoring you, but we were checking in with Matt @  
Automattic on acceptable team sizes.

We're already 3 and have a plan and the tasks setup.
Matt advised 3 as a good number (keeping budget and productivity in  
mind).

Maybe next time. Please don't hate me! :p

I tried using the suggestion below but I still can't get it to work.  If
anyone could take a look at my example, I'd really appreciate it.  I have
created a single file Menu Tester plugin and posted the source here:
http://www.onefishtwofish.net/menutester.txt - save the file as
menutester.php and drop it in your plugin directory.

I can get the Menu Tester pages to appear under the Manage, Presentation,
and Options tabs without any problems.  I can create a Top Level tab called
Menu Tester but can't create the sublevel tabs and the behavior of the Top
Level tab is also odd.  When the top level Menu Tester is selected, the
Options tab is highlighted and you see all of the option sublevel tabs but
the page content displays what I would expect from the top level Menu
Tester.

Thanks,

Mike

Yes, actually.

Instead of this:

> 'mt_toplevel_page');

Do this:

> add_menu_page('Test Toplevel', 'Test Toplevel', 8, __FILE__,  
> 'mt_toplevel_page');

Passing a string doesn't work for top-level menus.

Hey Mike,

The example is correct as far as I can see. Can you pastebin [1] the
code you're using so someone can take a look at it and see where you
might be going wrong?

That's what I use.
There has been a problem with publish_post in that it would fire for  
later edits which didn't really make sense. As far as I am aware this  
has been corrected in 2.3

Subject: [wp-hackers] Switching to Swift Mailer?
Message-ID: <46E9661F.8090600@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I was looking at plugins that add SMTP to WordPress's mail sending today 
and I came across Swift Mailer[1]. According to their site it's far more 
sophisticated than PHPMailer (which is no longer maintained).

I've only looked at it briefly, but it looks like it would make sense to 
switch from shipping PHPMailer with WordPress to use Swiftmailer 
instead. Anyone else have a view?

I'm happy to rework the wp_mail() function to use Swift Mailer and 
submit a patch, just wanted to float the idea first.

Cheers - Callum.

That is under consideration. 03/10/07 21:40:03 changed by ryan
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3862#comment:7

"I've been looking over swiftmailer, but it is has dozens of files
versus phpmailer's one file. If anyone wants to experiment with
plugging swiftmailer into wp_mail(), let us know how it goes.

http://swiftmailer.org/

Use their php4 package rather than the php5 one."

OK peoples.

I tried out page2cat which would be perfect for me but it didn't seem to work.

Then I started experimenting with page templates under K2. I know some
of you feel that K2-questions don't belong here but I feel that this
is  stuff that might as well have been done in standard WP.

I use a custom key to define the category instead of hard coding it.


=======================================
<?php /*
        Template Name: Page With Category
        Set a custom key named "category" on your page and let the
value be the category_name of the category you wish to display
*/ ?>

<?php get_header(); ?>

<div class="content">
    <div id="primary">
     <div id="dynamic-content"> <?php include (TEMPLATEPATH .
'/rollingarchive.php'); ?> </div> <!-- #dynamic-content -->
      <div id="current-content" class="hfeed">
       <?php

        $category_name = get_post_meta($post->ID, "category", true);

        query_posts("category_name=$category_name");
        global $more;
        $more = 0;
        include (TEMPLATEPATH . '/theloop.php');
        comments_template();     ?>



      </div> <!-- #current-content -->
     </div> <!-- #primary -->
    <?php get_sidebar(); ?>
</div> <!-- .content -->

<?php get_footer(); ?>

:-)

Not to all involved in the discussion - the filter has the arguments  
the other way round from my original proposal.

  		$value = apply_filters("sanitize_option_{$option}", $value,  
$option);

This is to ensure if no one if on the hook $value gets populated with  
$value not $option ;-)

$option is there as well as in the hook name to allow you to register  
one function to handle all your plugins different options and still  
know what you are filtering.

That should probably stay plugin territory.

Matt,

Could you eloborate a bit more on why this should be a plugin? AFAIK the 
phpmailer class is not being maintained anymore and has caused some 
serious annoyances with some other projects (non Wordpress) of mine 
regarding security. So I'm not a big fan of it anymore ;)

Swiftmailer seems to be an interesting - and more important - maintained 
solution to Wordpress mail(). Or are there other reasons not to choose 
Swiftmailer as a replacement?

grtz
BjornW

I have no time at the moment either, but here is something that might  
help.

The blog post here has a pdf export of a keynote presentation I did  
recently about developing on the iPhone.

http://blogs.omnium.net.au/main/2007/09/03/developing-web-apps-for- 
the-iphone/

It leaves out the obvious stuff that is on the Apple website (like  
"use standards", duh!) and concentrates on the quirks and gotchas of  
iPhone development. There are lots, enjoy.

This is information gleaned from WWDC (which is all public now  
anyway) and the Apple Website. I hope it's useful.

iPhone Safari doesn't support file uploads AFAIK.

It has no "real" file system that Safari can browse.

The presentation I pointed to before has a good break-down of  
available screen real-estate in Safari. Don't forget the chrome which  
eats up a lot of space too, and when the on-screen keyboard is  
showing, it's even less.

Very true.  Is the only way to get photos off the beast (aside from
syncing) still sending via email?  If there were a way to hook into
the photos/camera screen, that'd be super sweet.  (From my reading on
the subject, the answer seems to be "You'll get 640x480 pictures
mailed to your Yahoo! address, or nothing, and like it!").

It seems to be 320x364 when the keyboard is hidden, 320x100something
when it's extended.

Email is used just for notifications in the core and phpMailer does the job,
not to mention that it is a one file solution, whereas Swift Mailer has
probably the same size that WordPress.

If you are developing a plugin and need a solid email framework to build
upon, then use SM, build a wrapper and pack it in a plugin.

Neither of these things seem related to whether one is a better solution than the other.

Personally, I'd think that reliable built-in email capabilies would be far more important implementation details like that, regardless of what the solution is.

Approximated from Apple documentation...

Screen Dimensions
? Raw - 320 x 480

? Safari with normal chrome
    ? Portrait - 320 x 416
    ? Landscape - 480 x 256

? Safari with maximum chrome
    ? Portrait - 320 x 356
    ? Landscape - 480 x 196

? Further reduced when keyboard is shown
    ? Tab index on form elements is important

I think there is a facility to upload photos to a .mac account  
through one of the custom apps. Emailing photos should work like on a  
normal device, so there is the possibility to add a link to the email  
application inside the WordPress iPhone plugin where you could send  
an email with the photos you want to upload attached. The link could  
inject a special subject into the email so that it sent the photos  
directly to the upload folder in the given WordPress installation, an  
ajaxy refresh of the file picker in the post authoring page would  
allow the new file to be used without a page refresh.

This would require a modified post by email functionality.

Does that make sense?

Huh, that's funny, you wrote all that, but when I read it, my brain
translated it to "Sounds like a Version 2 feature!"

For me the things that turn me off SwiftMailer over PHPMailer are  
from a quick look at it:

  1. The number of files - this increases the chance of someone  
breaking there install with a dodgy ftp transfer.
  2. PHP4 support is being dropped so by next year we will be in the  
same place we are now - supporting the mailer ourselves
  3. SwiftMailer is designed for mass-mailing PHP applications - not  
something required in the core
  4. SwiftMailer requires configuring with an smtp server - it  
doesn't use mail() which means we have to add more options to the  
admin which must be configured - giving a slower install (mail is  
sent during install)

For me, especially once you take 2 into account, we are better  
staying with PHPMailer now - if we can make that work better than mail 
() for 90% of our users then we will be in the right place - the last  
10% will realistically be difficult to support and better suited to a  
wp_mail replacement plugin.

It does. You it has 4 or 5 different methods of sending Mail.

PHP-Mailer is not that big. If we're in a situation where we're 
maintaining it anyway, let's just give it its own repo and make it 
available as a public good for others in the same situation as us. 
(Needing a small, but functional mailer that falls back to mail().)

Sounds like a good plan to me.

I guess the PHP4 vs 5 debate is for another thread... ;-)

I reluctantly agree on the basis of PHP4 support. If WP is committed to 
being PHP4 compatible, switching to Swift Mailer would be a bad move.

Message-ID: <ae81acd10709141200o37c79232p7d5495b7caf189b3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello there

Don't know if it's because I'm dumb or something like this, but I find
myself doing *a lot* of echo "<pre>";print_r($stuff);echo "</pre>";
when coding something to check how things are doing.

It's to a point that I've added the following to my wp-config.php :

function wp_print_r($input, $pre = true) {
	if ($pre) echo "<pre>\n";
	ob_start();
	print_r($input);
	$output = ob_get_contents();
	ob_end_clean();
	$output = attribute_escape($output);
	echo $output;
	if ($pre) echo "</pre>\n";
}

So, heh, you know, I thought, if some day committers run out of patch
to roll in, well, what an awesome addition it would make ;-?

Cheers,

Ozh

[quote=http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.print-r.php]
mixed print_r ( mixed $expression [, bool $return] )

return
    If you would like to capture the output of print_r(), use the return
parameter. If this parameter is set to TRUE, print_r() will return its
output, instead of printing it (which it does by default).
[/quote]

Of course the return argument only works in >=PHP4.3.0.  So that could
be shortened to

function wp_print_r($input, $pre = true) {
	if ($pre) echo "<pre>\n";
	echo attribute_escape(print_r($input, true));
	if ($pre) echo "</pre>\n";
}

Good suggestion!  It saves a lot of keystrokes, for sure.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Post URL
Message-ID: <46EB0997.80303@yadan.net>

I am extending FireStats to support post title of urls.

for this I am maintaining the post title as a metadata of the url inside
a table in FireStats.

I hooked to publish_post and to edit_post, and I update my metadata there.

so far so good.


during the installation/upgrade, I want to go through all the posts and
do the same.

I see two options:

1. iterate on all the posts, and call my function that update the title
for each one. this can be pretty slow and is not desirable.

2. create some big update sql statement, that will use the post guid as
a url link.


the big question is, can I trust the post guid? what happens if the user
changes the permalink structure? will the post guid be changed with it?

what do you guys think would be a better solution here?

Post GUIDs should not change after they are set.  They are not a  
reliable indicator of the current URL for the post.  They are merely  
a unique token for that post.

How about a rolling upgrade that happens as posts are accessed?  That  
is, the first time a post is accessed, see if you have its title in  
your table structure.  If not, add it then.

When you need a logger for development, try WPsyslog:
http://www.zirona.com/software/wpsyslog-wordpress-syslog/

wherever you need to capture output, simply insert

<?php wpsyslog($mymodule, $logmessage, [$loglevel]); ?>

for example

<?php wpsyslog('foo', print_r($bar, true), 0); ?>

Subject: [wp-hackers] PHPMailer was a mistake
Message-ID: <46EB21E2.6080402@dragonu.net>

Going over the previous thread, it seems that only the bad/wrong 
suggestions are being heard, while the more correct arguments are being 
ignored. Perhaps, I might have better luck, but I doubt it. At least be 
open to reason. This will be long and it will be harsh.

Reasons Swift Mailer should be used:

1. PHP 4 support will be available long enough for the package to have 
reached stable enough status and it would probably only be another 6 
months before PHP 4 support will be dropped altogether. Supporting PHP 4 
after that would not be the wisest decision.

2. Swift Mailer already has a close enough API to PHPMailer that 
switching would not be difficult and has more features that would have 
to be added by the core developers or by patches. It is not a viable 
choice to continue supporting a dead project when an already better one 
with more features that are correctly implemented exists.

3. Swift Mailer supports PHP 4 and PHP 5 currently and is in the third 
version. Thus, it meets and exceeds the requirements for WordPress and 
will be a long term solution for plugin developers.

4. Swift Mailer is maintained by a skilled developer, therefore 
WordPress developers are wasting time maintaining PHPMailer. Every bug 
report, patch, and commit to class-phpmailer.php is only wasted 
resources that could be better spent making WordPress even more kick ass.

Something like this already exists and it is called Swift Mailer.

1. There are three things wrong with your point. The first is that half 
of the statement is a matter of opinion and preference. The second is 
that the last point is very rare, I've only had that problem once in all 
of the years I've uploaded something and that was only a matter of 
switching from passive mode to regular and uploading the files that 
failed the first time. This also shouldn't be the lone reason for not 
doing something as it won't effect the majority of users.

The third reason is the kicker. Are you trying to tell me that because 
Swift Mailer uses a different class pattern that it is immediately at 
fault? A quick code audit would have told you that a lot of the core 
functionality of PHPMailer is in Swift Mailer, but correctly split into 
separate classes. PHPMailer is a mess. It uses the Singleton class 
pattern when it should at least, from what I've read in the comments, 
into 4 or 5 separate classes.

Is object theory difficult? Hell yes, I've been researching and 
developing using classes for years and I've only just recently finally 
understood some of the concepts. You don't pack everything in a single 
class. It is noobish and in most cases, wrong. Objects should only 
encapsulate what its functionality requires. For every section of 
comments, the methods below should be in their own class. Google It, and 
tell me I'm wrong.

Classes should be separated, unlike the mess that is WordPress classes. 
You should be able to look at the class path and be able to find the 
class. This is what I've been saying! If you *NEED* documentation to 
find a class, then you are doing something wrong. The benefits of 
splitting the classes into their separate files, is more than this 
however. It is good coding practice, because it makes it easier for 
other developers, for the above and is the defined coding style of other 
languages. If you don't agree with me, you *SHOULD* agree with 
programmers far smarter than you and I would ever hope to even dream to be.

2. PHP 4 support is being dropped by the PHP developers, therefore your 
point is invalid. Are you going to pick up programming PHP 4 for the 
masses after the core developers have dropped development? It would be 
pointless to continue development on a platform that is not going to be 
supported. "Yes, I would like to shoot myself in my foot, willingly." 
Please, WordPress should drop support for PHP 4 anyway after 8/8/08 and 
you have no valid argument against this, because this is how normal 
professional software development is.

Do you think software companies still develop and maintain software for 
Windows 98? Nope and you'll be a fool to do so.

3. Excuse me. What about plugins? What about Subscribe2? You don't have 
to support plugins, but at least don't make it difficult for those who 
want a reliable mailer. By your and Matt's own admission, PHPMailer is 
even more than what is required.

You are also wrong, because the whole purpose of PHPMailer is not for 
core functionality, you've already admitted that it is more than what is 
required, it is for external development. You are also wrong that Swift 
Mailer is for mass mailers, that is not the case. It is merely a better 
replacement for the built-in mail function. If you took the time to look 
at what it provided or at least admit, if in fact you did more than 
glance at it. You would realize that it offers enough to even replace 
PHPMailer easily. Not all of the classes are required to make it work 
<http://www.swiftmailer.org/wikidocs/v3/tutorials/basic>.

 From the documentation, it will only take 4 or 5 lines, unlike I 
suspect PHPMailer.

4. Like another person pointed out, there are many connection options 
that you can use. Your argument is therefore incorrect.

Let us count up the total. Oh yeah, You're totally wrong. You lose, but 
since you are a core developer, we all lose. Your opinion might matter, 
because of your position, but that would only make you an ass for taking 
advantage of your position. By shoving better solutions aside because of 
your opinion, you have ignored facts that would better help the 
community, namely the plugin one.

No, it isn't, because legacy code is still being maintained. If it was, 
then all of the problems (Subscribe2 as one example) that came up and is 
associated with PHPMailer would have been reason enough to switch to a 
better solution.

If that is the case, then the built-in solution mail() should be used 
instead and phpMailer should also be a plugin, albeit, probably a plugin 
that is packaged with WordPress. I would then say that Swift Mailer 
should be along that package and provide both along side each other for 
plugin authors. Or at least include both and allow the plugin authors to 
call either one they wish.

"Neither of these things seem related to whether one is a better 
solution than the other. Personally, I'd think that reliable built-in 
email capabilies would be far more important implementation details like 
that, regardless of what the solution is." -- Charles

I concur, really the arguments so far are piled on a stack of cards and 
any real developer would see the discussion for what it is. I think the 
others need to grow up and learn to face change and when it is time to 
change. It is time to call it quits for PHPMailer, and find another 
solution that is packaged with WordPress.

This is the reason I'm building Unit Tests. If you do a search, you will 
find many papers and resources on doing this. PHPUnit and SimpleTest are 
two major ones for PHP. If you are just starting out SimpleTest would be 
a better solution. SimpleTest has documentation and tutorials. Sadly, 
there isn't much else to help you, if you are still interested. You can 
read what the author of PHPUnit has to say about Unit Tests, by 
searching for him and reading his phpWorks Presentation.

I ran into the same thing, and ended up creating these two functions
that I use all the time


function html_print_r($v, $n = '', $ret = false) {
 if($ret) {
  ob_start();
 }	
 echo $n.'<pre>';
 print_r($v);
 echo '</pre>';
 if($ret) {
  $result = ob_get_contents();
  ob_end_clean();
  return $result;
 }
}

function comment_print_r($v, $n = '', $ret = false) {
 $result = "<!-- \n";
 $result .= html_print_r($v, $n, true);
 $result .= " -->\n";
 if($ret) {
  return $result;
 }
 echo $result;
}

Dude, no need for output buffering -- just add "true" as a parameter to
print_r():

	$doesntecho = print_r($input, true);

To be fair, IIRC, print_r() uses the output buffering routines
internally to capture and return the information.

This will work, but it has an extra penalty of checking if something is
a post and if the title is in the database for each access.

I`d rather avoid extra overhead.


I thought that guid was not supposed to change, thanks for making it clear.

By the time iPhones come out in Australia the plugin will probably be  
up to version 3, so I can't complain really.

Probably.
the reason is that php was developed as one big ongoing hack. :)

I probably should have cut this down some, but I need to provide some 
clarity.

I'm not calling out anyone's skill as a developer, just that the 
motivation is suspect for arguments against this. This encompasses the 
complete argument against what some of the core developers believe to be 
truth and lack of acceptance towards PHP 5. If there is anything that 
makes me more angry, it is when the facts are ignored. I make this 
mistake, as do all humans, but to not consider something that doesn't 
fall into some perceived paradigm is a way to never grow as a developer 
and I say this from personal experience.

Short version: When official support by the programmers of PHP 4, 
software support should also be dropped. No, the world will not stop if 
this is not done, but if needed, older versions that still run on PHP 4 
can be maintained for a while out. Ultimately, it is up to you, whether 
you want to stay in the stone age.

While WordPress maintains its ease for end users, it is terrible, aside 
from the plugin implementation, for new developers. Tell me then, 
external libraries are for the purpose of applications to use and so 
that the application doesn't have to implement those features 
themselves. I would say that if you were to compare LOC of Swift Mailer 
and WordPress, WordPress would still be massive.

What am I saying? WordPress goes so far as to create a PHP 4 Exception 
class, that can't be handled as an exception. I suppose to get ready for 
a PHP 5 move in some distance future, but it is "interesting."

I would say the same for maintaining Kses, instead of using HTML 
Purifier, which is already being maintained by another skilled developer 
who knows what he is doing. The point of using external libraries is to 
not rewrite the wheel over and over again. If a better solution is out 
there, it shouldn't be rejected for the reason that it isn't beautiful 
enough, because some components are WordPress code are anything by pretty.

I explained this more above and below in the post, but allow me to 
iterate. If you were to do it right, you would split the Singleton into 
multiple classes and create a class library, which Swift Mailer already 
is. If you did it wrong and continued to pile methods into PHPMailer 
class, then please learn more about Class Patterns and OOP. Further, are 
you going to add features that Swift Mailer already has and pull 
resources away from WordPress development.

Short Version:
1. If this were true, then there would be issues with many more web 
applications.
2. This is invalid because not only is PHP 4 support being dropped for 
Swift Mailer, but development of PHP4 is being dropped next year.
3. Not really. It can be used to easily solve the mass mailing problem 
that plagues mail(), but it can easily be used for a replacement for 
PHPMailer and mail().
4. Wrong. Swift Mailer includes three major mailing techniques: 
sendmail, SMTP, and mail(). Two others are for load balancing, try that 
with PHPMailer.

I would not take your number 2 argument into consideration and not 
because I prefer to develop using PHP 5, but because PHP 4 is dieing and 
will soon be dead. Therefore we should stick with a crappy mail() 
replacement until you decide that enough is enough and we should use a 
real class library that actually doesn't suck?

By your logic PHPMailer should also be packaged as a plugin, so I can 
enable it when I need a better solution. If Swift Mailer is too much for 
core, then PHPMailer is also too much, because they exist to solve the 
same problem and therefore should be able to be used one or the other 
for the solution.

Quick question:
On every single shared host (and dedicated) I've seen, PHP was
configured to use localhost:25 no password to send email.

Assuming that the lack of an SMTP server is an obstacle, wouldn't it
suffice to have it set to localhost:25 by default?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Automatic feedback from users
Message-ID: <46EB9969.8010408@yadan.net>

Hi all.

when developing software, in many cases we are guessing things and
continuing assuming this guess is true.

that's the nature of the work, and this will not change.


recent examples:

* sticking with PHP4 for now: based on the guess that PHP4 is still
dominant and will stay dominant in the near future.

* holding on to PHPMailer: based on the guess that it's good enough for
90% of the users.


and so on.

wouldn't it be nice if at least for some of those things, you would be
able to base your actions on facts instead of on guesses?


In FireStats 1.3, I added an option for users to send me system information.

on the first run, I ask them if they agree, and if they do I send the
information to my server when ever something changes.

this allow me to get a good idea about the popularity of various php
versions and mysql versions among my users, as well as to know about
some usage patterns (in my case - how many sites each instance of
FireStats is monitoring on average, for example).


I intend to make some of the information I obtain public when I get the
time, for now just take a look at this:

http://misc.firestats.cc


so, my suggestion is to add a similar mechanism to WordPress.

this can also send a list of plugins users are using, provide a lot of
information on what users want from WordPress.

for example, if you find that 15% of the users are using some kind of
email plugin, it's a pretty strong indication that the "90% of the users
are happy with current mail support" is false.

another example: if you see that 10% of the users have some kind of
podcast plugin installed, it's a strong indication that at least 10% of
the users of WordPress are podcasting.


I am willing to help on the technical level with this, I have a pretty
robust solution for this that will work even if the server does not have
http access (data is sent from the client browser).


just to stress the a point here:

I am not suggesting spying on users: we will only get information from
users that agree to help.


    Omry.

WordPress is designed to be easy to use and install for end-users.   
Therefore we have to support the installed base of software (mysql/ 
php/etc) not what the "manufacturers" of this software say we should  
support - in $dayjob we have learnt this the hardway our customers do  
not have the money to upgrade to the latest and greatest version of  
windows - therefore even though Microsoft may not support a Windows  
version we need to support our customers in the best possible way.

We should only ever deprecate  support for a version of PHP / mysql  
on technical reasons - this is the kind of sound technical judgement  
we as a development community have to take.

So all the OO Code written in C in the Linux Kernel is just wrong is  
it.  Using the features of the language in a way which fits in with  
your programming paradigm is sound development practise.

 From what I know HTML Purifier and KSES don't do exactly the same  
thing - the biggest problem in switching to HTML Purifier over KSES  
is proving that it doesn't open any security holes.  You don't change  
something that isn't broken.

As someone who spends all day at $dayjob writing highly OO code I  
don't agree with you here - once of the biggest mistakes that nieve  
OO developers make is to spilt there code into too many classes.

Classes need a purpose - creating more just to split out the code  
does not make good OO practise.

If I was to sit down and design an OO model for sending email then I  
can see myself coming up with the following class structure:

A Class to represent an EMail - accessors and mutators for all the  
common parts of an email - To/From/CC/Subject/Body/HTML Body/ 
Attachments etc.
(If i wanted to process incoming emails then I would ensure this  
class could successfully parse as well as generate emails)

In my first design I suspect that sending and email would just be a  
case of calling a method on the email itself.

If I wanted to enhance this design and abstract away the sending then  
I would probably create an interface for mail transfer and create  
implementors of these for the transfer methods I had in mind - e.g.  
mail(),smtp etc.

This doesn't lead me to anywhere near the number of classes provided  
by swiftmailer.

This is a problem - our user base have trouble uploading files - this  
is something we have to be aware of and need to include in our  
decision making process.

As I said above - we want to support our user base - not alienate  
them - when PHP5 is the standard for webhosts then we can consider  
dropping PHP4 support - until then there is no technical reason to do  
so.

So it does - but why does the simple example code not use mail() then  
- afterall that would be the simplest way of using SwiftMailer and  
require the least code.

If we were to start WordPress developement now then PHP5 would  
probably be the way to go - we could write something much more OO  
(like Habari maybe ;-))

Our roots are PHP4, we have endusers running on PHP4 - we don't want  
to alienate them or hold them to ransom.

Yeah, I took on the challenge along with Doug and Viper, but I'm in  
Canada.
So no soup for me for now either. :)
Could go for the Touch (if we pull it off), but I might just ask for  
an IOU until the iPhone is out (again, IF we *win*).
Working well so far. D and V are a pleasure to collaborate with (and  
all improvised too).

I think this is a great idea and would provide some excellent data to 
base decisions on. It would also be fascinating data.

Questions:

1) At what point would we ask the user to give permission? You mentioned 
the Upgrade script, I think that would be sensible, except, users are 
"supposed" to disable all their plugins before they upgrade.

2) I've heard talk about auto-notifying users when plugins are updated. 
Could we add this functionality? If each WordPress installation has a 
unique ID we could easily gather stats.

3) Could we add a second question to the install? Currently we ask 
"Notify XXX about new posts", we could also add "Notify WordPress.org 
about my server environment, plugins and tell me about plugin updates".

I'd also be happy to put some time into this.

Cheers - Callum.

1.

I was thinking in the direction of having this functionality in
WordPress core, and not as a plugin, so your concern about disabling the
plugins is not relevant.

I can think of a few options to ask, for example in the initial
installation screen we can have a sentence with a checkbox (for
installing users), and we can also pop up some message in the admin
screen if a user never answered the question before (by saying yes or no).


2. see below.


3. this is a part of the system information I think we can send once the
user say it's okay to send system information.

in FireStats I send the following bits (not all are relevant to wp, but
to get the idea):

/**
 * System information includes:
 * Unique firestats id
 * FireStats version
 * Installation time
 * PHP version
 * MySQL version
 * Server software (apache? IIS? which version?)
 * Memory limit
 * Number of sites monitored
 * Number of sites monitored from each type (how many wordpress blogs,
how many drupals etc).
 */


for wp we can also add plugin and their versions.

its tempting to add a notification mechanism that tells the user about
updates, but let's not mix those two things.

this should be strictly for statistics, I don't think it would be wise
to bundle any functionality with it.

something like that should probably be implemented and designed separately.


Personally I don't have much time to put into coding this, but I will be
willing to provide code that does similar things, for both the server
and client side, to kickstart the effort.

Omry, you misunderstand.

If the user disables their plugins before running the update, how can we 
record which plugins are active?

As I said in my previous email, "I've heard talk about auto-notifying 
users when plugins are updated." I believe this is already being 
implemented as part of the move wp-plugins.org. Therefore, I was 
suggesting adding the statistic gathering onto the existing project, not 
the other way round.

Cheers - Callum.

Simple enough: _WordPress_ upgrade should automatically disable
plugins and make a list of which were active.

This list can be uploaded to a server somewhere, and even better, once
upgrade is complete it can attempt to re-enable that list.

This will hit two birds with one stone:
The list of plugins
Issues caused by users not disabling plugins when updating.

Subject: [wp-hackers] PHPMailer was a mistake

I think that's a very important point Peter raises.

In reality, developers aren't supposed to do what's "right" assuming
they're starting from scratch at this very moment, but what's right
for the project as a whole and its users too - keeping in mind where
you started and where you are now.

Like Windows or not, the reason its so frikkin successful ATM is
because of backwards compatibilty. Bill Gates (back in the day)
insisted on making every verison as backwards-compatible as possible
with the one before it - something other operating systems at the time
did not do and it came back to haunt them.

I think BALANCE is the most important thing though. As a Windows
Developer (I know, I know...), I've come to realize that 99% of the
problems I as a developer and many people as end users experience come
from the fact that Microsoft is sticking to the same code it used a
decade ago and only repairing and improving upon it. Then again, if
they didn't Windows would never have become the number one OS it is
today (in terms of usage, not quality).

As Peter said, ********IF********* we were to start WordPress
development today...

Well, we're not and therefore there is no easy answer. Just like
fishing, you have to reel it in some, and let it go loose some. You
can't overhaul all the code just because something better is out
there, nor can you ignore it all either.

With regards to PHPMailer, the real question we should be asking
ourselves isn't if Switfy is a better library than it or if PHPMailer
really is dead. Rather we should be asking what we would *LOSE*
switching from PHPMailer and what we would *GAIN* and comparing the
differences.

As it currently stands:
The only thing actually *missing* from PM is SMTP support.
We stand to break some stuff and open a whole can of worms by
switching to Swifty.

Keeping in mind that anyone who wants Swifty can install a plugin (as
I have done), _AND_ that it's almost trivial to add proper SMTP
support to PHPMailer, I think the LOGICAL and UNBIASED answer is to
just give adding SMTP support to PHPMailer a shot and see how it goes.

I LOVE object-orientation. I use and recommend Swifty in my own (PHP)
projects. But I love and understand WordPress too, and the right thing
to do ATM, regardless of which library is "better" per-say, is to add
SMTP to PHPMailer and go from there... IMHO of course.

If we open this particular can of worms, there is no end to it. Sure,
switching to Swifty may not break that much code and may not pose a
security vulnerability of any sorts (not that I know that for fact),
but what comes next?

WP has managed to strike a balance all these years, now is not the time to stop.

Just like switching to PDO is out of the question ATM simply because
we don't NEED it for WP to survive and the current implementation is
suiting us just fine (more or less, all things considered), I think
it's the same for Swifty.

Hell, if you *really* want, ship a Swifty plugin with WordPress and
have it disabled by default. Let it overwrite the entire mailer class,
and have fun.

Anyway, just my two and a half cents (inflation, you know)...

Message-ID: <4681c7d40709151124t4db97b29m1a6b01d8ed1891af@mail.gmail.com>

Just a quick question:
Should 404 headers be sent for missing content or only missing files?

If a post is missing, should that be an error message or a full 404?
Back in the day, it wasn't really much of a question:

If /blog/my-article-2.htm wasn't there (keeping in mind that it was a
physical file), it was a 404.

But now that's not a real file, it's just a permalink. If a permalink
doesn't exist or is broken, what's the correct *standard* behavior?

Sending a 404 :)

Officially, if a file is not there ANYMORE, you should send a 410,  
Content deleted, but no one does that.

Cheers,
Joost

Subject: [wp-hackers] XCache Variable Storage vs. WP Object Cache
Message-ID: <4681c7d40709151131s27c0d1eh4031b7825dbfbe14@mail.gmail.com>

OK, I'm no expert on PHP opcode caching and stuff, but I've recently
switched from eAccelerator to XCache (part of the Lighttpd project,
but for other servers like Apache and IIS) (much better performance
results so far, and MUCH better code/reliability for IIS).

Since switching I've installed a plugin for vBulletin that also takes
advantage of an extra feature that XCache has called "variable cache"
which saves me a couple of queries per page request since it's been
enabled. In vBulletin I did that by switching the "datastore" from
vBulletin's default disk datastore to a custom XCache class made for
vBulletin which hooks into my XCache installation and caches it in the
memory there.

Does anyone know if vBulletin's "data store" is the same concept as
WP's in-built "object cache"? Would there be any benefit in using
XCache's variable cache instead of the inbuilt WP object cache?

Links:
XCache: http://xcache.lighttpd.net/
vBulletin XCache Plugin: http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?p=1196156


The vBulletin XCache plugin was created by an XCache developer.

Probably because it's almost impossible to keep a list of all the
files you ever had...

Anyway, you'd have to check if that permalink *used* to exist and if
it does but isn't there now send a 410.

But even then, what if it never existed? Is that a 404? IMO it should
be (logically), but you end up *somewhere*.....

I know there are custom 404 error pages with useful links on them; but
is that what we can call the WP "page not found" message?

Just one small point, we can quite easily add SMTP support with 
PHPMailer, so that's one less reason to switch. I wrote a simple plugin 
which adds an options page and enables SMTP to localhost 25 by default. 
Cheers - Callum.

Good point.
I guess the answer is that we will not do it during the upgrade.

That would be a fine suggestion, be we need to be careful not to bundle
functionality with statistics gathering.
users that opt not to provide statistical information should not be
punished by reducing the functionality in any way.

Personally I hate these things... But as long as it's an option that is
disabled by default (and the checkbox is unchecked in the installation,
upgrade, etc), then it'd be fine, I guess...

The idea is to ask the user a direct question.

if he doesn't answer yes, it's a no go for sending stats.

I generally agree if the statistics can be traced to an individual. 
However, if we keep the stats anonymous so there's no user data, I think 
it's ok to track them automatically as part of the core functionality.

The bottom line is, by analysing the server stats we could tell how many 
people had what plugins installed. If I want to check for a new version, 
I have to send a request somewhere with the name of the plugin and ask 
for the latest version number. Standard web logs will store the remote 
IP and the plugin name.

If we don't store the remote IP in the stats, then I see no privacy or 
other issues of stat collecting.

Cheers - Callum.

PS> I'm a privacy nut, I don't use Google except through a separate 
browser proxied to a single IP because I don't like their privacy 
policy. On the other hand, I have no issue with anonymous stats! :)

I believe so. I'd look at the APC or memcached plugin for how to get 
started.

I know, I'm just saying that the checkbox (for the question) should be
unchecked, since a lot of software has it checked by default.

I am suggesting a direction yes/no question.

at least in FireStats, I actually pop a floating window asking the
question, and if the user does not answer it will show up again later.

if this is too hard, I also fine with a checkbox that not selected by
default, although I think we will get higher participation rate if users
will actually have to answer a direct question.

This is what I initially thought, plugins that are not compatible with
the version of wp may break the blog (even with the mechanism for
detecting syntax errors).

I think it would be best to simply ask the user the question if he never
answered it, and do it in the admin section.

the logic can be as follows:


if (get_option('user_agrees_to_send_system_info') == null)

{

   $answer = ask the user();

   update_option('user_agrees_to_send_system_info', $answer);

}


if you want to something similar in action, install FireStats 1.3 and
see. it's the first question I ask the user.


btw:

I keep the information I sent to the server serialized, so if it changes
(PHP version was upgraded for example), I will send it again.

for this reason, I also provide UI for the user to say he no longer agrees.

The build-in WP object cache (which you enable by     define 
('ENABLE_CACHE', true);    in wp-config.php) uses the filesystem to  
store the data.  Sometimes you get a speed benefit as compared to  
having to do the SQL queries on every load, but sometimes you don't  
(which is one of many reasons why it isn't enabled by default).

But it is almost always going to be faster to use a memory-based  
object storage engine than the built-in file-based method, as  
retrieving data from memory is orders of magnitude faster than  
retrieving data from a hard disk.

You can probably build an XCache object cache in an afternoon, so  
it's worth a shot.   Make sure you measure before/after speeds to see  
what kind of difference it makes!

It can be pretty potent when combined with other plugins though, which 
reminds me I have some stuff to clean up and release.

The problem is that you need something like the remote IP for these stats to
be useful. How else are you going to distinguish between a blog that sends
its data twice (after an upgrade for instance) and 2 separate blogs sending
data. You don't want to count that upgrade as a new blog.

I generally agree if the statistics can be traced to an individual. 
However, if we keep the stats anonymous so there's no user data, I think 
it's ok to track them automatically as part of the core functionality.

The bottom line is, by analysing the server stats we could tell how many 
people had what plugins installed. If I want to check for a new version, 
I have to send a request somewhere with the name of the plugin and ask 
for the latest version number. Standard web logs will store the remote 
IP and the plugin name.

If we don't store the remote IP in the stats, then I see no privacy or 
other issues of stat collecting.

Cheers - Callum.

By a unique ID for each that isn't the IP?

You'll notice that many software say no "uniquely identifable data"
that ****"can be traced back"**** to you or your computer.

If you assign each blog a special GUID ***that cannot be traced back
to that blog or that computer**** it's still useful but not an
invasion of privacy.

Yeah, I would say that you should never refactor legacy code. Right? I 
don't think so, the argument is whether PHPMailer should be replaced 
with Swift Mailer and while a plugin could easily be made and packaged 
internal or external of WordPress, I believe firmly that it should be 
packaged internally, because it would be used more if it was packaged 
internally than externally. It would also keep Plugin authors from 
having to package it themselves and with the edge case of having two or 
more plugins that have packaged Swift Mailer in the distance future.

Developers should look to the future for where development is heading. 
I'm not saying go crazy and change the project every time something new 
comes out. Hell, in a recent example, I didn't want to switch from 
Gallery 2 to Coppermine because of the support I would have to do for 
Coppermine, but it offered every feature. I just cried every time I had 
to look through the code. I mean that change, if it has clear advantages 
to the project would mean work that wouldn't have to be done.

WordPress could easily be refactored to use Swift Mailer, the only 
changes would be adding the library files and changing the default 
wp_mail code to use Swift Mailer instead.

Backwards compatibility doesn't have to be sacrificed, except for some 
of the more advanced plugins which may use PHPMailer class instead of 
Swift Mailer. Research would have to be done for those people, but if 
you give enough time, they'll have a fix in a short period.

You do know that I'm crazy enough to have started exactly what you said 
WordPress shouldn't. However, I believe helping with WordPress would 
improve my skills with working with legacy code, which I lack.

The issue with Swift Mailer replacing PHPMailer has never been, "If we 
had built WordPress today..." I bought that up in a tangent to prove my 
point and even then my point was that code should be written so that 
future changes don't come back to bite you. Excusing one paradigm 
because it doesn't match yours is not reasonable development.

I'm not saying, overhaul all of the code. The change shouldn't be more 
than a few additional lines and perhaps an options table like some of 
the plugins offer for adding SMTP or sendmail configuration.

What Peter and Matt want to do is worse. Not only are they ignoring it, 
they want to rewrite what is already in Swift Mailer to their 
"standards". Okay, perhaps I'm being arrogant since Matt does have 
something I don't, a web application that a hell of a lot of people use 
(and love). That still doesn't mean that everything that they write is 
truth.

I'm saying that in my educated opinion, time shouldn't be wasted on 
adding SMTP support to PHPMailer, when it wouldn't (most likely) hurt 
anything to use Swift Mailer or include Swift Mailer plugin by default 
instead.

Lose: Nothing to the core of WordPress. Only a few plugins, might be 
affected, but given enough time, like WordPress version 2.4 or 2.5, they 
would be able to change over.

Gain: SMTP support, Sendmail support, load balancing support for those 
dedicated servers that send a whole lot of mail.

Not really, but I'll do a code audit, if only to prove that one of us is

you know.

Yeah. As someone who has written something that already existed in 
something else, you would merely be wasting your time, as I did. The 
only thing you would gain is some added insight, but if you already have 
that, then there is no point.

I *LOVE* OOP too. It is sweet! At the moment, yes, Swift Mailer 
shouldn't be added to WordPress 2.3. Swift Mailer is better, because 
there are facts to back it up. And the old argument comes up. No, it 
wouldn't be logical to add something to a library when another library 
already has that.

Would you rewrite Zend_Controller, because you didn't like how it did X? 
I would hope not. If you wish to extend the functionality, how would you 
continue doing that? Would you add more methods or would you create a 
new class with the functionality?

Yes, add FUD to the discussion, that'll help your argument. I would say 
that if anything, the developer using the library should take the 
precautions, even if there weren't any.

Nothing. The problem that was in the original thread was if Swift Mailer 
could be used instead. If we stick to that, then I won't go any further. 
I care not at this moment whether HTML Purifier is used or Zend 
Framework is used, or if CakePHP was used. It matters not, my argument 
is merely the lack of giving something a second thought because you 
don't agree with its appearance and where its heading.

If this were a perfect world, all development would have already 
succeeded to PHP5, but I'm an optimist. This discussion next year, might 
be a little bit different. I believe that once developers have grasped 
the sexiness of PHP5's SPL, PDO, Filter, DateTime (this one is sweet!), 
etc that we'll all be on the same page.

I should have stated and I'm not sure if I did at one point, is that 
ultimately I have no say. I can only piss at the wind for all of the 
power I have in the direction of WordPress. However, I believe at least 
I can call out what I perceive to be inaccurate and add my reason to the 
discussion. The only opinion that matters is that of Matt, westi, Ryan, 
etc. I feel my job at the very least is to add truth, where I can to the 
argument and try to pull some developers to my side. Even then, the 
developer would have to see for themselves.

What balance? WordPress is simple and gets the job done for the end 
user. Its plugin model gets the job done for the developer. In this 
discussion, it would be helping the core developers as they wouldn't 
have to maintain PHPMailer any longer. A win-win situation, but I can't 
figure out why this is a big issue.

I had a discussion of PDO with someone, I forget who. I realized 
something about application development is that you are right. WordPress 
doesn't need PDO to survive, since it duplicates, in part its 
functionality. It could make developers lives easier, but SQL would 
still have to be rewritten to match the change. The best way to handle 
that? I don't know.

Once WordPress reaches PHP 5 status, then $wpdb can use an instance of 
PDO. Until then, it does make sense to continue support of the DB Access 
object. However, this is only because PDO is PHP 5 only, Swift Mailer is 
PHP4 and PHP5, therefore the same argument doesn't hold true.

I agree. The current Swift Mailer plugins should be looked at for 
inclusion of WordPress 2.4. The plugin that needs it can always 
automatically enable it, if they need to.

Yes, based on sound technical judgement. Not, completely ignoring change 
based on, "Well, it has too many files, and supports PHP5." Sound 
technical judgment would be to actually test the library, see what 
actually breaks, compared to what is broken in the current library. My 
argument is that the benefits of Swift Mailer was completely ignored 
based on these assumptions.

I suspect WordPress is going to support PHP4 far outside the day that 
PHP4 official support is dropped. Okay, I'm not a developer working on 
WordPress, so I don't care what the developers choose to support or not. 
What I do care about, is if I'm going to use it and have a problem, what 
will I have to do to fix it. Sure, I could easily write a plugin, and 
I've done that specifically for using HTML Purifier. No big deal, I just 
didn't use Kses, because it gave me problems.

Yes, perhaps you are correct that if the issue is an edge case, that 
developers shouldn't take the time to "fix" the issue. If this was a 
dropped case, then what argument would be given when PHP4 development 
support is dropped and how many hours were put into adding SMTP support 
to PHPMailer? I say, that since Swift Mailer offers everything we need, 
plus more, we only need to use what WordPress core needs and offer the 
rest to the developer.

That isn't my argument. My point is recreation of the wheel. That and 
I've solved this particular problem with only passing an array, since if 
you are passing an error, except an error. The benefit of real 
Exceptions is that if they aren't caught, they are thrown and it would 
come up as an big error. A big error that would give you a clue as to 
what happened.

Error handling is error handling, if you pass the error by integer, 
string, array, or object, it is pretty much the same technique. Perhaps 
it is future proofing, as when PHP 5 support is added, the class can be 
thrown. If it extends Exception at that point, then it might make more 
sense, after I've thought about it. The shot I made was low and I take 
it back that line, but I maintain the previous paragraph.

How do you know that Kses doesn't have security holes? HTML Purifier 
runs tests against XSS attack cheat sheet and passes most of them. The 
added benefits of HTML Purifier, is that the WordPress balancing 
function would be obsolete and no longer would need to be maintain. I 
think that is a plus, unless the function is absolutely perfect. 
However, HTML Purifier is still being maintained and extended.

They do actually do the same thing, except HTML Purifier doesn't need an 
extra function to balance tags.

Yes, that would be accurate as it would break the "You're not going to 
need it" Extreme Programming paradigm. However, to be clear I was saying 
that once you reached the point that the methods you are adding, meet a 
different purpose than the class, it is time to make a new one. In my 
experience with writing highly OO code, I would say this is the best 
explanation or rule to live by.

Planning would create a better class structure and maybe the Swift 
Mailer did or did not do this originally. However, with v3, the 
developer had specific feedback on problems and solved those sets of 
problems. It does not mean WordPress is faced with similar problems, but 
third party developers that work with WordPress might benefit with the 
addition.

Which Swift Mailer does and PHPMailer does not. I would have rather this 
be the case, but my argument is also that to do so for PHPMailer would 
be to take away what Swift Mailer already offers. If you compare what it 
would take to get PHPMailer to the standards of Swift Mailer, it would 
be insane.

This is because Swift Mailer has been in development for longer than the 
week or two (well, it might take it shorter amount of time, but testing 
and debugging you know is included) it would take for you to complete 
your project. Swift Mailer has been in developer for at least/almost a 
year. Therefore it has had more feedback then your mental project and 
from that has improved on this base system.

The author of Swift Mailer is not some noob, and is more knowledgeable 
than me. If you put your knowledge of OOP above mine, then at least he 
is at your level. Why argue with me that his project doesn't meet your 
standards? Look at his first version and his current requirements and 
see for yourself if this project isn't something worthy of inclusion. 
Who knows, it might infect other OO developers to follow down a similar 
development style, once they get used to it of course.

They must have a hell of a time uploading Gallery 2 and "real" web 
applications. I think it is a user error, than a FTP one. Perhaps PEAR 
would be a better deployment model? They would only need to do two or 
three lines on the command prompt, which you can give them. I'm not 
being sarcastic, seriously, PEAR as a deployment model would be 
wonderful, unless the user doesn't have access to shell and the host 
didn't enable PEAR.

I'm fortunate enough to not have this problem, because my host is 
awesome. However, like I said, the only time I've came across this is 
when the FTP server didn't support Passive mode. Perhaps, you should let 
them know and see if this is the problem.

Name a web host that doesn't give you PHP 5. Even Godaddy hosting 
supports them, with an single .htaccess line. The problems are more with 
dedicated servers, and with those you have the choice between installing 
PHP5 and PHP4, so I would exclude dedicated servers from the list.

There is because they would still have the older versions, which would 
work on PHP4 on PHP5, but more importantly on PHP4. If they needs were 
met, then what is the issue? Security? I'm not saying don't maintain the 
older package, just don't dismiss something because its future paradigm 
is PHP5 and you don't like PHP5. Change is coming, whether developers 
want it to or not.

You ignored the part where I mentioned the problem that plagues mail(). 
With Swift Mailer, you can easily apply any one of the three in one line 
or you can test for SMTP settings, Sendmail settings, and fall back to 
mail with a simple if ... elseif ... else block.

I don't know what it would take to do the same for PHPMailer, but my 
continued argument is that it isn't worth wasting the time adding it to 
PHPMailer.

I looked at the Habari code, good stuff, but from an developers 
perspective, probably wasn't worth it. To get where WordPress is now, it 
would require many man hours. Good luck to them, but while I like their 
paradigm, I'll be more willing to switch to S9Y and more my resources to 
helping that web app. I'm not yet at that point, but my employers have a 
lot of love for WordPress and it would require that I do a massive 
amount of mod_rewrite to keep my link structure. Not going to happen at 
this point.

No one is saying you have too. Swift Mailer at this point does in fact 
support PHP4, therefore there would be no issue.

That's easy:

you generate a unique id for each blog (which is basically a random number).

Why not develop a plugin first, that could convince for a later core inclusion ?

I think you misunderstood what I said:
I personally do not believe that switching to Swifty will open any
holes or break much code (I'm using it now via a totally overloaded
function), I'm just taking the worst-case scenario.

Let me make this to the point:
Besides SMTP, what do we gain by switching to Swifty that makes it worthwhile?
(seeing as SMTP can be added in 5 minutes to PHPMailer)

I think a checkbox would be better during the install (and in the Options,
if the blog will periodically send information...)...

If it is just going to be a floating box, it should only show up once, it's
pretty damn annoying to get asked to do something multiple times.

Subject: [wp-hackers] ISAPI_Rewrite 3.0 mod_rewrite compatibility
Message-ID: <4681c7d40709151609g3c7f5e24se0c32cd628bfc4fa@mail.gmail.com>

Just a heads-up:
ISAPI_Rewrite 3.0 [1] by helicon has been released as stable with full
compatiblity for mod_rewrite rules [!]

I'm using it now to power my IIS6/W2k3 and IIS7/W2k8 sites w/
WordPress and it works great.

It uses .htaccess files and/or httpd.conf just like Apache, in the
same directories with the same content without any modification.

Note that the stupid Windows/IIS request_uri bug still exists, you'll
need to use this IIS hack [2] to make WP correctly grab the
request_uri value.

I'm not sure how to check if ISAPI_Rewrite is installed, I'll ask the
guys at Helicon and see if there is any identifying mark... If it is
installed, the same permalinks that are used for WP on Apache on Linux
can be used on Windows, with the same exact .htaccess file and its
contents.

Unless you just say no, and then it won't ask again.....

That's the way I understood it, correct me if I'm wrong:

Pop-up box.
If user says yes, send info, don't bother again.
If user says no, don't send, don't bother again.
If user doesn't answer, bother again.

I guess... I guess I'm thinking of a normal popup, with a close button.
Still a little annoying though.

For what it's worth, I agree a straight-forward check-box is the way to go :-)

Radio Buttons?! They don't have to be preselected. I think that should
solve most of the problems. You can have a little JS which asks the user
to select. And if JS is off - then it's a no.

You guys should really watch wp-svn more closely.

It sends some basic info by default, not currently being logged on the 
server-side, and to disable you need a tin-foil-hat plugin.

What sorta information? Where's the changeset for it (I'm not subscribed to
wp-svn :P)?

Yeah..

I intend to add a trend graph later, so at least the graph bring some
joy. (php4 going down, php 5 going up)

good.

so we are suggesting to make it more explicit:

1. users should be aware of it.

2. users should be able to disable it.

3. server should log the info.

4. useful info should be sent.


also, I am guessing that this is implemented as a server side http post.

this does not work for many users that have their server configured to
block outgoing http requests.

I have a solution channels the information through the client browser
transparently. this would be a much more reliable approach IMO.

I know PEAR perfers 1 class per file, but there are definitely
performance reasons for avoiding it.  Loading 100 classes in 100 files
may (even with APC-style script caching) be substantially slower than
loading 100 classes in 10-20 files.  Even with C++, large-scale
software often has multiple classes per file in order to reduce
compile times.  Just because Java has dictated "1 public class per
file" doesn't mean it's always the right answer, for every other
programming language.

Finding a class is just a grep away, no matter how large or
poorly-organized a codebase is.  If you *NEED* documentation to find a
class definition in an arbitrary directory, you will probably have
problems on any large project (I suppose if you don't have grep
available, that could be a problem; but that's your toolchain that's
the problem, not the codebase itself).

Heh, I spotted this function in WP the other day:
wp-includes/compat.php:

function printr($var, $do_not_echo = false) {
	// from php.net/print_r user contributed notes
	ob_start();
	print_r($var);
	$code =  htmlentities(ob_get_contents());
	ob_clean();
	if (!$do_not_echo) {
		echo "<pre>$code</pre>";
	}
	ob_end_clean();
	return $code;
}

:)

IMHO though, If you develop locally then you *really* should install xDebug, I have its profiler running whenever i'm developing a new application, and its great to locate what statement is taking up those precious seconds in a long loop.
But its greatst function is the var_dump override:
http://xdebug.org/docs/display (See "The Results", That output there is directly from var_dump with xdebug, or any of those examples on that page)
The other nice functionality is the stacktrace on errors:
http://xdebug.org/docs/stack_trace
(Infact, I didnt know you could set it to show the passed parametres either, Thats something i'm going to enable now, it'll be much easier to debug why a function fatally dies sometimes)

theres a PHP xdebug module available for windows pre-compiled, Pecl has it for linux i think..

A PHP alternative some people like is dBug:

I don't have any hard numbers at the moment, but I was playing with
memcache at one point and discovered something surprising (and
disheartening about PHP);  Caching arbitrary objects with memcache
(within a single request) was faster than using a PHP associative
array as a cache!  Memcache is wicked fast.

You bring up a good point. Some projects try to take a Yahoo directory 
approach to their codebase where others are flatter and obviously 
expected to be searched, a la Google.

We could rearrange all of our files, but I don't know that it would be 
"better" or just different. Most stylistic choices are equally 
arbitrary, and consistency is more important than being "right."

/me loooove memcache

But I wish php/memcache would allow for:
- regex for keymapping
- tag keys like done in the Zend Framework

On another note: I hope OpenMoko will go for webkit/webcore:
http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Web_Browser#Implementation_Recommendations
http://openmoko.com/

The plugin we're working on will work fine without CSS+JS, but it'll  
be nicer in full-fluff mode. :)

This is one belief I have had for a _long_ time, but never bothered to
say anything about it. I think that WordPress should retain a list of
past permalinks and return 410s for pages that are gone.

Also, I dislike the idea of a file-based web server. e.g. you request
/fruit/apple.html, which points to the server's DocumentRoot +
/fruit/apple.html. I wish web servers worked with a database for the
URLs (e.g. you could create an entry for /fruit/apple, then point it to
/home/jeremy/docs/apple.html), which would be more apt for handling
410s. I'm not aware of any web servers which behave like that -- the
closest thing I can think of is using a PHP script to do the job, and
using mod_rewrite to point all URLs to the script.

OK, I'm having some problems here... can anyone help?

I've completed the plugin (using same basic code as Ryan's memcache
plugin), but it crashes my (Windoze) server with memory access
violation errors.

Only thing I can think of is this warning on the XCache site:
Warning : At the moment, It is not possible to store resources,
callbacks or objects using xcache_* functions.


Does WP Object Cache attempt to cache any of these? If so, is there
any way of stopping it from doing so?

Thanks.

Theres quite a few Objects being stored in the Object Cache :)
I dont think any Resources are attempted for caching, and i'd be unsure about callbacks.

using serialize() should convert everything into a string for storing though.

I would like to point out that I agree with Jacob Santos on the point of 
using external libs instead of maintaining a dead in the water project 
such as PHP Mailer. The resources spend on PHP Mailer might be better 
invested into other aspects of Wordpress development.

Personally I really like the fact that jQuery is now part of WP so I 
don't have to include it with my plugin nor does any other plugin author 
anymore. This results in less files shipped with plugins and thus also 
lessens the likelyhood of errors due to including different versions of 
the same lib. The same could by thought of by using Swiftmailer instead 
of PHPMailer. It offers a bit more for plugin developers and is well 
maintained.

Just my 2 cents.

ps: As a sidenote I would like to point out that in the php4 vs php5 
discussion it seems we all tend to forgot that we don't have to be 
backwards incompatible in order to use php5. In fact WP does great on 
php5 (5.2.4) and php4 on my machine. Unless we want to start using 
specific php5 functions, which IMHO seems unlikely in WP, it all just works.

All the best,

grtz

Technically XCache only has a variable cache ATM, so that might
explain that limitation >.<

Is it *safe* to serialize all objects coming in and unserialize them
again going out? I know in some other projects I worked on there were
stuff you weren't supposed to serialize or the sky would fall (or
something like that).

I've been searching, but can't find an answer to this:
In PHP, is there an easy way to check if something is an object? I
know PHP's lax (for lack of a better word) (or rather, nonexistent)
datatyping makes this kind of hard, but it would highly improve
performance if I only serialized items that weren't normal
variables....

Forgive me, but isn't that what the entire argument is about?

OK, this is what I'm doing currently looks like:

set_data:
check if is_object() or is_callable()
if true, serialize.
check if is_resource      (resource is the only thing that is not safe
to serialize... )
if true, don't cache
else store it as-is

get_data:
check if data is_serialized_object()         (custom function)
if true, unserialize and return
else just return


While I don't get a PHP access violation right away like I used to
(before anything even loads), I still get an access violation mid-way
through the page load.


Anything else I can/should try?

Does anyone have any suggestions for me or is this just broken with the
current WP release?   There were no replies to posting of the code I am
trying to get working.

Thanks,

Mike

I tried using the suggestion below but I still can't get it to work.  If
anyone could take a look at my example, I'd really appreciate it.  I have
created a single file Menu Tester plugin and posted the source here:
http://www.onefishtwofish.net/menutester.txt - save the file as
menutester.php and drop it in your plugin directory.

I can get the Menu Tester pages to appear under the Manage, Presentation,
and Options tabs without any problems.  I can create a Top Level tab called
Menu Tester but can't create the sublevel tabs and the behavior of the Top
Level tab is also odd.  When the top level Menu Tester is selected, the
Options tab is highlighted and you see all of the option sublevel tabs but
the page content displays what I would expect from the top level Menu
Tester.

Thanks,

Mike

PS:  Is using PasteBin the norm with this group?

Is this supposed to be on in the wp-config.php

define(ENABLE_CACHE, true);

when using a custom object-cache.php?

It doesnt appear to be required, But i'd suggest it would be best to include it in your file.
from wp-settings.php:

/wp-admin/includes/update.php

I strongly agree with items 1&2. Silently sending information about installs
without the user knowing about it is going to cause a bunch of problems. I
seriously think that should be an option that is disabled by default. It
could be a simple checkbox on the plugin page, or offered as an option
during upgrade. 

I know nothing malicious is going to happen with the info, but there are
enough people out there that will think otherwise. Putting the information
out there so that any John Doe upgrading knows it is happening and can
opt-out will prevent problems.

Subject: [wp-hackers] eAccelerator and XCache Plugins for WordPress
Message-ID: <4681c7d40709160823s5c47d21cl3d23afa616bf3df3@mail.gmail.com>

I finally got the XCache plugin for WordPress to work, the same limitations
for XCache affected eAccelerator so I went ahead and did that one too.

XCache and eAccelerator for WordPress:
http://neosmart.net/blog/2007/xcache-and-eaccelerator-plugins-for-wordpress/

Note that these are BETA (I really mean it, these interface directly with
server-side executable extensions that can be quite painful!!)

They should be compatible with WordPress 2.0+ and all recent versions of
both XCache and eAccelerator and PHP 4/5.

I'd appreciated any testing, and if anyone can suggest a better way of
*cleanly* serializing and unserializing items when you have no idea what
they are... I'm all for it :-)

Anyway, that said, I've been running it on my main server (which has a
decent, constant load) for several hours now, and it seems to be all good.

Good point.

The good news (or bad news, depending on your perspective) is that PHP 5
will soon be a practical requirement regardless of whether individual
projects / apps will officially make the switch, because 4 won't be getting
security patches within less than a year from now. So everyone who's itching
to use 5 will just have to hold out a bit longer. :)

But seriously, in light of that EOL date, it seems like it would be
appropriate to have some sort of roadmap or at least an "official" published
statement for what the position of the WordPress project will be in regards
to PHP4 over the next year and beyond.

Even if the position is "we won't do anything that won't run in PHP4, even
for a period of time after it isn't supported anymore", it would be good to
get it out there.

Maybe it already is and I'm missing it? I know it's been discussed to death
here on the list, but I haven't seen it in a more public forum.

The decision was not to change what we're currently doing. Let's end the 
discussion there and have a moratorium on the topic, at least until 2008.

That's something I've considered before, and even started working on with a
couple of other guys... Unfortunately, the problem is always that RMDBs are
too damn slow for constant load like that, especially when you realize that
the same server that could handle 2000 req/sec can't even handle 10 anymore.

What needs to be implemented (and i have no idea why it hasn't been done
yet...) is a Server OS with a RMDB built into the kernel. If that was there,
you could do all kinds of cool voodoo :P

Might want to make that a more "public" (and permanent) decision by posting
it "officially" somewhere?

Well, if it was simply a plugin that only did that, then I think anyone 
who downloads and installs it would do so with the full intention of 
agreeing that information would be sent to somewhere. The only issue is 
that you must tell them what information is being sent and nothing like 
passwords are.

I would totally install such a plugin. I haven't yet looked at FireStats 
to see if it does only this. What else does FireStats do, besides send 
stats?

"I'm happy to announce that WordPress is not going to be changing 
anything and will continue its PHP support as it has for the past 4 years."

I know we don't post to the blog enough, but that's really scraping the 
bottom of the barrel.

It does not matter to our users, especially since we're taking the path 
of maximum compatibility. The whole point is that they should never have 
to think about things like that.

For developers, it's pretty hard to miss my blog post and the hundreds 
of messages on wp-hackers. If they did, it probably doesn't matter to 
them either.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Disabling the core update system
Message-ID: <1fa535a70709161823n60342889k20f2957db166decd@mail.gmail.com>

I maintain a multitude of WP installations for clients and friends and
I'm planning on upgrading all these installations to 2.3 when it's
released.

As I keep these installations up to date, and update them as soon as
possible after new releases are made, there's no need for the core
update system to check for updates, so I wrote a simple plugin which
disables the core update checking, and therefore disables any
notifications which might be displayed to users.

I thought it might be handy for other admins of multiple
installations, so you can get the plugin here:
http://lud.icro.us/disable-wordpress-core-update/

It's pretty freaking simple, but any feedback is welcome.

Regards,
John (johnbillion).

To be fair, that's a terrible way to have to search our archives. I wish 
there was something we could run on wordpress.org that provided a useful 
archive and real search for our various mailing lists.

CSS-D has a pretty cool one:

http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/

I wonder if it could be implemented inside WordPress? Posts and sub-posts.

no integrated search (it's just a prototype implementation) but
one of the nicest ways i've ever seen to view threaded
discussions via a browser:

The update_option() on every single admin page load is less than ideal.
Checking the value of "update_core" first and then setting it to false if
need be would be a much better solution IMO. ;)

Yeah, I too have wished for a better mail archive, but using Google to
search is a lot better than month -> control + F (which I've done before).
>_<

I wouldn't think it'd be too hard to get it into WordPress. Shame I'm
flooded with other projects at the moment though...

Actually, there is an even easier way than that!

http://groups.google.com/group/wp-hackers

"Search this Group" up at the top. The archives don't go back as far as the
pipermail ones, but that's only because WP-Hackers wasn't on Google Groups
from the very begnning. But the whole PHP5 discussion has been on there
forever:
http://groups.google.com/group/wp-hackers/search?group=wp-hackers&q=PHP5+PHP4

You can search by relevance or date.

How did that come to exist? It's handy, but I don't know how they did 
all that without us setting anything up.

I'm not exactly sure how it happened, but it seems that anyone subscribed to
a list can add that list to Google Groups?

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-September/thread.html#8266

That's the thread "where it all happened," it seems that was intended to
just be a frontend display was suddenly capable of sending and receiving to
the list too.

Quite handy indeed.

Try this out:

add_filter( 'pre_option_update_core', create_function( '$a', "return 
false;" ) );

And don't forget to submit it to the plugin directory:

I did it.

I simply created the group, subscribed the group's email address
wp-hackers@googlegroups.com or whatever it was to the mailing list,
which in effect spams the Google Group with all messages posted to the list.

GG has a very nice frontend.

The "hits table" reminds me of a problem we also have in WordPress -- 
sometimes we display things in tabular format when it'd be cleaner to not.

For that example specifically, imagine a layout like such, grouped by 
visitor:

<h3>[images] 82.123.123.2 - Opera/9.20 (X11; Linux x86_64; U; en)</h3>

Yeah,

I have a feature request to group by IP, and I`ll do it at some point 
(at least as an option).

Thanks for the feedback.

I agree with you in principle, _but_...

The iPhone has a hugely more sophisticated web browser than pretty  
much any mobile machine out there.  The thing basically runs a full  
deesktop browser.

This has two ramifications with regards to a "mobile interface"

1) It can actually run the regular WP interface pretty well

2) As more website and such code for the advanced capabilities of the  
iPhone, it is pushing hard on other producers to create mobile  
devices that can handle complex sites.

I don't think it's a bad idea to create a _really_ stripped-down  
interface for run-of-the-mill mobile devices, but I like the idea of  
creating a full-function (or most-function) for devices that are on  
this high level.  Other devices will catch up in time -- the market  
demands it.  :)

I want to figure out how well the iPhone runs Ajax.

I have some strong ideas about interface.  I'll write again when I've  
had a bit of time...

Suggestion:

Add a manual "Update" button in the admin screen that only shows up  
for Admin user -- invisible to any other users.

In fact, that button should be pretty prominent -- maybe at the top  
corner of each page if you're the admin (you can probably crib off  
the "Hello Dolly" plugin for how to do that. :).

Overall...
Good idea -- it will be helpful for admins of both tech-phobic and  
don't-bother-me-with-this-stuff users :)

I haven't looked at your code in detail, but I have found in the past 
that to get a stand-alone menu section to work, you need to have a 
submenu page for the main page of the submenu as well as the other 
pages. Here is some code that does work from a plugin I wrote for a 
client. You may be having trouble using just __FILE__ rather than 
plugin_basename( __FILE__ )... anyway, here is some working code:

// at global level:
$confmgrFileName = plugin_basename(__FILE__);

// the function that creates the screens:
function confmgr_admin_screens()
{
   global $confmgrFileName;

   $accessLevel = 10;

   // top-level menu
   add_menu_page( 'Conference Manager', 'Conferences', $accessLevel,
                  $confmgrFileName, 'confmgr_conference_screen' );

   // sub-menus

   add_submenu_page( $confmgrFileName,
                     'Conferences', 'Conferences',
                     $accessLevel, $confmgrFileName, 
'confmgr_conference_screen' );

   add_submenu_page( $confmgrFileName,
                     'Sponsors', 'Sponsors',
                     $accessLevel, 'confmgr_sponsors', 
'confmgr_sponsor_screen' );

   add_submenu_page( $confmgrFileName,
                     'Sponsorship Levels', 'Sponsorship Levels',
                     $accessLevel, 'confmgr_sponsor_levels', 
'confmgr_sponsor_level_screen' );

// etc. continues with other pages

}

Hope this helps,
      Jennifer

Hi Stephen, thanks for your input. What would the 'Update' button do
when clicked?

I'm guessing check for Updates to WordPress and Plugins... Instead of doing
to automatically, have a button to manually do it.

What he said.

I figure, any time you disable an automatic function, you should make  
sure it's easy to do manually. :)

OR... maybe you don't disable the update check, but make it so the  
messages _only_ appear to Admin?

Hi --

I notice that the documentation for WordPress throughout says to put  
language files in wp-includes/language/  This has always irked me,  
because it's one more thing to remember when upgrading WordPress.  I  
LOVE the idea that you toss everything but wp-content and wp- 
config.php -- there's no messing around with what's in what folder,  
etc.  This is by design, yes?

While looking through the code, I discovered that you can also put  
the languages folder in wp-content/language.  So... why aren't we  
just telling people to put language files in wp-content/language by  
default?  It makes for easier updating and is more consistent with  
the idea that that's the only folder you ever going to make changes to.

This is purely a documentation issue.  Am I missing some reason why  
this is done the way it is?

No reason, the documentation just does need updating.

It'd be cool if you could no specify a language and then just have no
highlighting, but still have the code presented in a nice way...

Yeah that would be another option. For some sites I manage though,
users log in with administrator privileges so they have complete
control over their blog, but they just don't have FTP access to the
server. Maybe that scenario is quite specific to me :D

Is that true, even with WP 2.3 beta code?

I'd be very surprised if this were NOT the case.  AFAIK the tables  
are only still there for debug purposes, and have no use once the  
code is ready for the general public.

Yes, I just checked a couple of days ago with the latest SVN.

Request_URI will still return index.php, which is script_name...

This is the most reliable workaround I've seen. It's part of my "Request_URI
for Windows" package as a fallback if ISAPI_Rewrite isn't installed:


if(isset($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']))

$_SERVER['HTTP_REQUEST_URI'] = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'];

else

$_SERVER['HTTP_REQUEST_URI'] = $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];

if($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']){

$_SERVER['HTTP_REQUEST_URI'] .= '?' . $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'];

}

$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_REQUEST_URI'];
Only thing is, if anyone is using a hack (like mine) to set REQUEST_URI to
the correct value, it'll overwrite it.

That'd require digging _heavily_ into the Javascript package as the styling,
highlighting, etc. is all done via Javascript.

Check out these functions in WordPress:

	- is_serialized()
	- maybe_serialize()
	- maybe_unserialize()

Also check what we do in wp-includes/cache.php (Default FS cache) to  
kill object references... we serialize then unserialize them.  It's  
not a great method because it uses a lot of RAM, but no one has yet  
suggested a better method.

Copy the file "shBrushXml.js", rename it to "shBrushBlank.js" and replace
any instaces of Xml with Blank and of xml with blank. Just delete any CSS in
the file, and remove the extra aliases.

Then add blank into the array in the plugin file.

Then you can use blank as a language and it won't be highlighted.

I'm sure you could remove some more extra stuff from the JS file, but
someone with more experience with JS should take a look at it...

Which are the three redundant tables?

More importantly, where do I go (on general principle) to find  
information like this?

Thanks,

Thanks Mark.

I'm using maybe_unserialize() and is_serialized(); haven't tried
maybe_serialize() though, I just serialize everything.

I'll be taking a look at cache.php and see if there's anything else I can
implement to make it work better - I just got some (slight) heap corruption
some 30 hours later.

Thanks again.

I'd be very surprised if this were NOT the case.  AFAIK the tables  
are only still there for debug purposes, and have no use once the  
code is ready for the general public.

Thanks Mark
In the past they have been left in although personally I like to see  
them dropped.
I am using a couple of plugins (not my own) that query the categories  
table and I suspect authors will be late bringing them up to date.  
With the table left in place they would continue to work (as long as  
I define no more categories of course). I suspect a lot of users will  
be in this position.
I'll start hacking them!
Thanks and regards
Andy

I'm sure they'll be dropped before final. No sense in keeping them as they
won't be updated by the core, so any plugin that's relying on them isn't
going to get the data it was looking for anyway.

He didn't say it was unreliable. He runs a WordPress farm and wants  
to disable the update notification on behalf o his clients. It makes  
perfect sense and doesn't say anything about the reliability of the  
feature, :)

Thank you very much for this example, it helped me quite a bit.  It turns
out my code wasn't much different than what is posted below BUT my code also
included calls to add_options_page(), add_management_page(), and
add_theme_page().  If these calls happen prior to calling add_menu_page()
and/or add_submenu_page(), the creation of the custom sub menus fails.

I have re-posted my code for a single file Menu Tester plugin which now
works.  Hopefully someone else will find this useful.

I haven't looked at your code in detail, but I have found in the past 
that to get a stand-alone menu section to work, you need to have a 
submenu page for the main page of the submenu as well as the other 
pages. Here is some code that does work from a plugin I wrote for a 
client. You may be having trouble using just __FILE__ rather than 
plugin_basename( __FILE__ )... anyway, here is some working code:

// at global level:
$confmgrFileName = plugin_basename(__FILE__);

// the function that creates the screens:
function confmgr_admin_screens()
{
   global $confmgrFileName;

   $accessLevel = 10;

   // top-level menu
   add_menu_page( 'Conference Manager', 'Conferences', $accessLevel,
                  $confmgrFileName, 'confmgr_conference_screen' );

   // sub-menus

   add_submenu_page( $confmgrFileName,
                     'Conferences', 'Conferences',
                     $accessLevel, $confmgrFileName, 
'confmgr_conference_screen' );

   add_submenu_page( $confmgrFileName,
                     'Sponsors', 'Sponsors',
                     $accessLevel, 'confmgr_sponsors', 
'confmgr_sponsor_screen' );

   add_submenu_page( $confmgrFileName,
                     'Sponsorship Levels', 'Sponsorship Levels',
                     $accessLevel, 'confmgr_sponsor_levels', 
'confmgr_sponsor_level_screen' );

// etc. continues with other pages

}

Hope this helps,
      Jennifer

Just one quickie: have it support [sourcecode language='lang'] and

There are some cross-browser issues (that's why I prefer server-side
formatting...):

On Internet Explorer, line numbers aren't preceeded by zero. In Opera, they
are:
1, 2, 3... verses 01, 02, 03

In IE, If the text scrolls off the screen, it will get a scrollbar to keep
on going without breaking. The problem is, this totally ruins the height of
the box. In Opera, the tex wraps to the next line.

I don't know if you can do anything about them or if you are planning on
sticking to the default code from the Google project page.u

Subject: [wp-hackers] Packing JavaScript
Message-ID: <1190116714.5509.94.camel@localhost>

Hi all,

WordPress comes with tons of JavaScript by default. Regardless of any
server-based compression, it's always a big bunch of bytes to download.
Ok, most of it is in the admin backend, but still, I think there's a
possiliblity for optimizazion -- especially if you think of WPMU
communities.

Some of you might know the nice JS packer by Dean Edwards [1], e.g. used
by MooTools [2] by default. It is a very clever tool to "compress"
JavaScript files to 30-70 percent of the original size.

I have made some tests on my WordPress installs, one is WP 2.0.11, the
other is 2.3-beta3.

With a little shell foo, you'll find out the amount of JS code in the WP
core: 

sum=0; for j in $(for i in $(find ./wp-admin/ ./wp-includes/ -iname "*\.js"); do du -b $i | cut -f 1; done); do sum=$[ $sum+$j ]; done; echo $sum

The outcome is: 357642 bytes for WP 2.0.11 and 1020175 bytes (!) for WP
2.3-beta3.

Now I've taken the php5 version of the packer [3] to test it on the JS
files in the WP core. I extracted the package to WP_ROOT/jspacker/ and
uncommented the argv section in example-file.php. Then I ran the
following:

for i in $(find ./wp-admin/ ./wp-includes/ -iname "*\.js" | sed 's|\.js$||'); do cp $i.js $i.src.js; php ./jspacker/example-file.php $i.src.js $i.js; done

Running the first command line again (the sum stuff) and subtracting the
results from the respective previous results (because it also counts the
new/copied src files) shows that the compressed JS files now make a
total of 195703 bytes (2.0.11) and 562329 bytes (2.3-beta3). This is
about 50% of the total size saved.

Now the big question is: Does it break the JS? It is to say, that in
rare cases, the packer can break JS code. And indeed, some short tests
on both versions showed the following:

- Most JS, including the remote stuff, works as expected.
- On 2.0.11, TinyMCE seemed not to be able to initialize, so WP came
with the fallback editor, though that one worked.
- On 2.3-beta3, TinyMCE works fine, though switching between Visual and
Code doesn't work.

In Firefox, the web developer toolbar shows some errors with the syntax
in the packed files, which explain the above problems.

Bottomline so far: There is a possibility for much optimization in the
size of JS downloads. There are some minor problems, which can be solved
though (e.g.: fix files manually, not compress files that seem to break,
fix packer).

Now one can even imagine to go one step further: I find it also annoying
that one has to download so many files. In theory, it would be better to
pack all JS into *one* big file and let the UA download that one. This
would significantly reduce the number of HTTP requests.

Of course, I wouldn't want to merge TinyMCE, Prototype and all the other
JS in one file in the source distribution, but one could imagine having
a backend JS handler that gathers all JS files to be inserted and
delivers them as one. We do have API hooks for JS (at least in the
admin), so it wouldn't be too hard to gather the files.

It's even possible to imagine a global on-the-fly packer combined with a
JS cache, which could again bring additional performance.

Just some ideas ... what do you guys think?

Kind regards,

The best JS-compresser I've seen (in terms of compatiblity and size) is from
the DoJo toolkit:

Just my 2 cents..

Compressing the JS definitely would be a win.

The best safe compressor I know of at the moment is Julien Lecomte's
YUI compressor.

Don't be fooled by it's name, it works for anything.

The way it works is it uses a JavaScript interpreter to build a parse
tree of the JavaScript and writes out the JavaScript again.

This allows it to safely interpret the JavaScript and therefor safely
write it back out.

In addition it can now do safely do variable renaming since it knows
the scope of variables.  It can tell if the scope of a variable is
outside the code it is compressing and then not rename it.

In tests that I have seen and the few informal ones I have done, YUI
Compressor performs better than any of the other minifiers I have
seen.

I believe that is the same method used by the DoJo ShrinkSafe compressor..
I'm not a real JS coder (or even a fan), but this is from their site:


ShrinkSafe is a JavaScript "compression" system. It can typically reduce the
size of your scripts by a third or more, depending on your programming
style.

Many other tools also shrink JavaScript files, but ShrinkSafe is different.
Instead of relying on brittle regular expressions, ShrinkSafe is based on
Rhino <http://mozilla.org/rhino>, a JavaScript interpreter. This allows
ShrinkSafe to transform the source of a file with much more confidence that
the resulting script will function identically to the file you uploaded.

Best of all, ShrinkSafe will never change a public variable or API. That
means that you can drop the compressed version of your JavaScript into your
pages without changing the code that uses it.

I dunno.

Probably just sticking to the default code. I just threw something together
honestly. I hadn't really planned on expanding on the Javascript aspect of
the plugin.

I did however discover that the PHP part of the plugin (my / Matt's code)
worked rather well at keeping code the same and all that, so I may end up
releasing a server side flavor of the plugin. Dunno. Bit busy with some paid
work and the iPhone project at the moment.

While I see the benefits of the idea, I'm not sure how useful it will
actually be in this particular case. Looking at the SVN:
-jQuery is already packed code.
-TinyMCE gets gzip compressed if the browser supports it (examine
tiny_mce_gzip.php).
-There's various pre-made packed versions of Prototype and
Scriptaculous if you need them, best to use those instead of rolling
your own. Or better yet, wrap them into gzip.

And so on. These javascript compression methods just always strike me
as a bit silly. You'd be better off creating a static *.gz version of
the file and having the web server serve that directly. Of course,
that's only "easy" with either Apache 1.3 and mod_gzip or Apache 2.2
and mod_deflate+mod_filter, but still, it's more of a server thing.

Essentially what I'm saying is that the WordPress package should
really only include a) pre-packed versions of code from the actual
code providers, or b) some easy way to configure it to use server
features for compression.

Actually distributing packed versions in the core just seems like a
bad idea in the long run. It's modifying these standard libraries, and
while it might not break core code, it could break plugins wanting to
use those libraries and which are expecting them to work like the
originals do, without fail.

I think it would be design a build system for all these compression
stuffs - you might also be interested in compression CSS (use CSS
Tidy) or HTML compression (Template level)

Are you sure? Seems very strange that it should be so. Did you go back 
and take your working code, and put in an add_options_page call, and 
verify that it made your other code not work?

If the code is already packed so much, how could I come out with
reducing the size by 50% with that other packer? ;-)

Not exactly. Mod_gzip and others deflate the file, while they do not
reassemble the code itself. Have a look at one of the packed files (e.g.
at the MooTools download page) to see what is meant by packing the JS
code. It is possible to combine compression and packing to get even
better results.

I think that if a WordPress-based packaging turns out to be efficient,
secure (in the sense of code integrity) and easy maintainable,
WP-internal packing should really be considered.

The standard libs would still be provided as source. And plugins will
still be able to use the packed libraries, as the function names and
public variables are preserved. If they weren't, the compression would
be completely senseless in the first place.

However, maybe it would be possible to provide the WP admins the option
to chose whether they want the JS compressed or not. If they don't want,
the src file will be delivered.

Alex

I have been thinking about how to optimize the js files from WordPress
for a while as well (especially the ginourmous Prototype.js). There are
two problems that I can see with using packer.

The first is what you already mentioned. There can be problems if the js
has not been prepared with packer in mind (not using a semicolon after a
function assignment for example).

The second is that some of the included js libraries are already
compressed using either packer or something else (jQuery).

There is one way that I have been thinking could help quite a lot
though, especially for people like myself, who are on Windows hosts
which doesn't gzip by default.

Since WordPress has a queue script function, WordPress knows about all
the scripts that would be needed before they are output to the header
(assumption, I didn't look into the code yet). So why not glue all the
queued scripts together in a single file and then gzip them in one shot.
This would reduce the number of connections to the server, as well as
reduce the file size of the gzipped scripts.

And since it's going through php, we could add other performance
enhancing features, such as far future expires headers (we could
construct a url that contains information about the included files, and
their versions so that updates could be retrieved by clients, if things
need to change).

Once that's in place, we could even go ahead and look into adding some
experimental packer or jsmin or something else.

TinyMCE already has a similar feature (it packs it's many separate js
files into one, then gzips it using php).

The last adventure down this path was reverted after problems were
encountered and it seems like a pain trying to debug in a compressed
file.

I see. Unfortunately I hadn't found the trac tickets before posting my
first message. I did search the web, but I haven't found the trac
tickets.

I agree that debugging a compressed file is pretty much impossible, this
is why I've thought of a switcher. As for the actual packer problems, I
think one could try different packers and give the best one a try.

However, if the WP core team is through with packed JS, I guess I'll
have to accept it. ;)


Kind regards,
Alex

Don't think anyone is saying anyway is through with anything just

I am reasonably sure but I will check it again tonight.  I used your code
and it worked so I started comparing my code to yours and the
add_menu_page() add_submenu_page() calls were virtually identical but mine
didn't work.  So I then made them identical and mine still didn't work.  So
then I commented out my calls to add_options_page(), add_management_page(),
and add_theme_page() and mine worked.  So I then tried to uncomment them one
at a time to see if one was the problem but having any one of them caused it
to fail.  So then I moved them below the calls to add_menu_page() and
add_submenu_page() and everything worked as expected.  Odd?  Yep.

I'll double check it later tonight.

Are you sure? Seems very strange that it should be so. Did you go back 
and take your working code, and put in an add_options_page call, and 
verify that it made your other code not work?

That's easy: you failed to pay attention to what I actually said.

jQuery is JS-packed already. The rest are not, but I was pointing out
the lack of benefit to packing most of it.

Okay...
1) It's not "assembled" in any sense in the first place, because it's
*scripted code*.
2) You missed my point here as well. The *only* point of packing
javascript is to reduce filesize and thus reduce bandwidth usage. You
can sometimes also do that by gzipping the files and serving them that
way.
3) I was drawing a comparison here and making a statement about what's
best for WordPress, not suggesting this method as a course of action.

I know what packed JS code is. I'm not new at this, thanks.

Not by much. And it only makes page rendering that much slower.
Admittedly, packed JS code reduces page rendering time by a *lot* more
than mere compression does, but both is still worse than either one.

Well, I don't, for the reasons I gave before. Perhaps you missed those
reasons, so I'll try again:
1) Rolling your own packing makes no sense from a maintainability
standpoint, as you are packing 3rd party libraries and it would make a
lot more sense to use their pre-packed versions, where available.
2) It is not possible to create a packing system that works on all
javascript code all the time, so any packing systems you make may
break in the future when the library changes.
3) Bandwidth reduction is often better achieved by compression, and
this is arguably a server side thing to do.
4) The amount of bandwidth reduction produced by JS packing is
arguably not worth it in some cases, as it adds a significant amount
of processing overhead to the client side of the equation.

Argh...
a) You cannot guarantee that any given approach of JS-packing will
work for all libraries and all cases unless you have a test suite for
all those cases.
b) Even if it works with the WordPress code, WordPress is not the only
piece of code using those javascripts that you propose to pack.
c) Providing them as source is not what I was getting at, although I'm
against providing both source and packed versions in the distribution
in any case as it's needlessly making the distribution larger.

Yet more useless admin options is not what we need in WordPress. Pack
or don't, but don't give an option.

+1 to using a wrapper script to gzip the js's.
+1 to add better header control to that, to increase cache time to
longer periods.
-1 to concatenating all the scripts together. This eliminates the
benefit of caching and also makes the variable header code less
effective at caching of the normal pages, since script enqueues may be
variable. Also it introduces problems with how to make an effective
naming scheme for the concat'ed js's.

TinyMCE is a special case. It does that because it pretty much has to,
being made of dozens and dozens of JS files. And seeing that JS
doesn't have a good way to include other JS files from JS files, it
would be incumbent upon the html author to include all those script
files manually, which would be a nightmarish pain in the ass.

Oh, and it just occurred to me that the WP-Syntax plugin could pretty
easily be modified to work at post creation time instead of post
display time. This would mean that GeSHi would only have to run
through the code one time, when you publish it.

Ouch. Didn't know that. Okay, yeah, that's a deal-breaker for me. If

For simple packing systems, that's absolutely true.

"Real" JavaScript compressors like YUI Compressor (which use a "real"
JavaScript parser) are perfectly reliable with good code, in my experience.

JavaScript compression complements generic text compression nicely.  I use
"SetOutputFilter DEFLATE", and that works very well.

Anyway, the combination of (1) JavaScript compression, (2) generic
server-side text compression and (3) file-combining is the norm, not the
exception, for sites that uses JavaScript for anything more serious than
roll-overs.

I doubt that the minimal difference between packed JS and unpacked JS,
given than both are being compressed using zlib, is highly
significant.

1 and 3 are useless in most (not all, mind you) cases. Whether it's
the "norm" or not is debatable and largely opinion unless you can
actually prove it with statistics. But whether they add a significant
difference or not can actually be measured through testing. I submit
that adding 1 and 3 to 2 will not produce a significant difference
from just 2 alone.

1. How do you know unpacking the javascript is slower than downloading
the uncompressed file?

this depends on the client machine speed and on it's network speed.


2. obviously reducing the size of the code will make it download faster,
but does it really matter with today's conditions of fast connections
and smart browsers that cache everything?


3. I think the greatest benefit will not come from reducing the size of
the javascript files, but from including only the needed things in each
page. and NOT inlining huge chunks of javascript straight into the page.
(this prevents the browser from caching the javascript).

you can see example of such inlining on the widgets administration page.

While true, I think it's pretty obvious that executing interpreted
javascript code is going to be slower than downloading a few extra
bytes for most of the JS code we have in WordPress.

Take the Prototype. It's about 69 kb. Packing it gives you something
like 34 kb. While a 50% reduction is nice, it's still only like a 34k
difference. With any high speed connection, you're talking less than a
second. It's only a few extra packets over an already setup TCP
connection. And it's cached that way as well, eliminating any
unpacking evaluation time.

Now, as your JS gets much, much larger, sure, it's going to shift the other way.

On the other hand, simple gzip compression reduces prototype from 69k
down to like 6k. And that does make a noticable difference in both
bandwidth consumption as well as rendering speed. The impact to the
browsers is minimized simply because the decompression phase is built
into the browser, it's native code instead of interpreted javascript
decompression. The overhead is minimized.

On the other hand, I do see what's being said regarding combining JS
files into one, however I'm uncertain if that helps enough to make any
real difference. A few extra requests combined with more browser
caching when they're separated might make a bigger difference. Too
often the "web 2.0" development type people only look at total page
load size and ignore the effects of smart browser caching.

Total agreement, and this actually argues against JS-packing and
combining JS files as is being discussed. The enqueue script is the
way to go with this stuff.

So, on the one hand, you propose to gzip everything, on the other hand
you dislike the overhead of unpacking the JS? Where's the logic in that?

Wrong again, sorry. Here are some figures:
For 2.3-beta3, the uncompressed overall amount of JS is 1,020,175 bytes,
the packed file size with that specific packer is 562,329 bytes (we know
these figures from before).

Now, let's delete the src files and compress the packed files:

for i in $(find ./wp-admin/ ./wp-includes/ -iname "*\.src\.js"); do rm $i; done
for i in $(find ./wp-admin/ ./wp-includes/ -iname "*\.js"); do gzip $i; done

(Note that I used the default gzip compression value, -9 would result in
even smaller files.)

And count again:
sum=0; for j in $(for i in $(find ./wp-admin/ ./wp-includes/ -iname "*\.js.gz"); do du -b $i | cut -f 1; done); do sum=$[ $sum+$j ]; done; echo $sum


The overall file size of the gzipped JS files is 256,051 bytes -- the
file size was again reduced by about 50%. This means, if you combine
gzipping and compressing, you might be able to reduce the overall
payload size to 25% of the original size.

Please provide arguments why a performance improvement is "useless". As
for statistics/testing, see my above examples.

Sorry, I forgot to provide a figure for only gzipping all the JS files
(without packing): It's 285,305 bytes.

This means indeed that with a gzipped connection there is only a small
benefit of packing. However, we know that many people cannot use gzip on
their connections, so the idea of packing the JS remains valid -- the
one doesn't hurt the other.

Compressed JavaScript (as compressed with YUI Compressor, etc.) is just
"minified", an so doesn't have to be unpacked.  It's just JavaScript.

You're probably thinking of "packed" JavaScript using Dean Edwards' Packer
(or similar).  I think they're risky because they don't use real JavaScript
parsers.

I'm not sure how you arrived at that conclusion.

Check out this chart to understand how server-side text compression and
JavaScript compression/minification* are complementary:

<http://yuiblog.com/assets/pageweight/filesize_by_type.gif>

Combining files when possible is almost always a good idea for deployed
apps, since (1) HTTP requests are relatively expensive and (2) browsers
typically limit themselves to two parallel downloads per hostname.

P.S.  I tend to call minifiers that use JavaScript interpreters to avoid
introducing new bugs during the minification process "compressors".  Not
everyone makes the distinction.

Just my two cents:

I think it is pretty illogical to not do something just because it "might
not be as effective" as other things that aren't mutually exclusive.

Hell, if it's just a 1% difference w/ minification + gz compression +
bundling vs just gz compression... That's 1% TIMES xx MILLIONS of requests
to your blog === LOTS of bandwdith saved!

And in this case, it's more than that, seemingly a lot more. But even if it
isn't, I don't think that's a good excuse.

This is not true because of browser cache.

besides, you need to look at the bigger picture:

how much you are effecting the entire size of data a user gets when
connecting to the blog, not just how much you save from the javascript.

for example, if your entire front page is 200k including images and
everything, and you can save 10k of javascript out of 20k, you didn't
save 50%, you saved 5%.


in addition, the javascript is used mostly in the admin section,  the
default theme does not include ANY javascript files.

I think if there is an option, we should compacted javascript files
provided by library authors.

nothing more.

I just did a test with the plugin you had posted on your web site, and 
you are right, putting the add_options_page section above the 
add_menu_page does break it.

I see what is happening in the code, and I have submitted a Trac bug 
report with details. I took the liberty of posting your plugin to the 
bug report; hope that is OK since you GPL'd the code. See:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5001

I'm working on a patch...

Given that the javascript is only used in the admin, I agree, we should 
reduce the workload for the WP developers and stick to what we can get 
from the lib authors, leave it at that.

I think combining into single files can _significantly_ improve 
performance. I have one TinyMCE instance that creates 174 requests, it 
takes 90 seconds to load. _But_, there's no point doing this ourselves, 
it creates too my work for the benefit in my opinion.

My two pence! Cheers - Callum.

Only if you live in the USA. Consider us poor souls living in Australia.
I gather the 'norm' for broadband speeds in the US is around 8mbit, right?

Well, over in Oz, (where we have to travel by riding flying foxes
everywhere, because otherwise we'd fall into the sky, as everything's
upside-down here), the average broadband speed is 512K. If you live in a
CBD, you can get 24mbit, but that's not affordable for most people.

Plus, often latency is the issue, not bandwidth. Believe it or not, it
takes me 250 milliseconds to ping most websites. I'm sure that someone
in the US would have < 50msec. So, in the 200msec they're ahead of me,
I'm sure they could have executed most of the JS unpacker while mine is
still waiting for a response.

Same here - except it's worse :-)
305 ms to ping my own server (in CA)

"Standard" broadband is 128-256, I'm lucky enough to afford 512/128 (and
that's a frikkin 50USD a month!!!)
And there are bandwidth limits for almost everyone here (unless you pay
extra to cancel them).... which are ridiculously low, like the limit for
256kb internet is just 3gb a month [!]

Subject: [wp-hackers] New tag entry plugin
Message-ID: <46F05F1D.2010804@poplarware.com>

We have had a few discussions recently on Hackers and Testers WP lists 
about tag functionality in the core of WordPress. As I mentioned in at 
least one of my previous posts, I needed more functionality for 
defining tags than the core WP implementation of tags allowed for on 
the post editing screen. In my case, it was specifically in order to 
handle multi-lingual tags (e.g. need to be able to enter the tag's 
slug directly rather than generating from the tag name, which contains 
language tags). Someone else also requested the ability to choose tags 
from ones previously used on other posts.

So, I've created the first pass at an "Advanced Tag Entry" plugin, 
which adds a section to post edit screens. It works fine for me in the 
current bleeding-edge WP 2.3; I haven't tested with any of the RC zips 
specifically, but it should be fine. Feature list and download at:

http://poplarware.com/tagentryplugin.html

Thanks in advance for any comments you can supply!

Uhm...no, that's not true.  The compression and decompression times
can actually (and quite often) equal less than the time gained in

It can be.  The next goal for YUICompressor is to optimizing the
variable substitution to allow zlib to compress the file even further.
Generally, packing the JS helps some, the amount depends on how the
packing is done.

Just curious, have you tried any of these things out yourself?
Because what you're saying isn't true.

I am in Hong Kong, I paid $15 US for 10MB upload/download VDSL
unlimited usage, but oversea is still not very fast.

Compression is good, anyway.

The xmlrpc.php lacks any useful. I wanted to be able to support
enclosures being defined by blog clients, such as VidBlaster

These two hooks would make this a much easier thing to do.

In function mw_editPost immediately before $this->attach_uploads()

do_action('xmlrpc-mw_editPost', array('postdata'=>$postdata,
'content_struct'=>$content_struct));


and in function mw_newPost immediately before $this->attach_uploads()

do_action('xmlrpc-mw_newPost', array('postdata'=>$postdata,
'content_struct'=>$content_struct));


Other hooks may also be useful, but these two would sure help me out

Here in europe we always thought the net was better in US... and
cheaper.. but looks like this is an old story I just signed up for
ADSL service for new appartment and i will get a 6mbit download and
1Mbit upload with VOIP (and if the line can support the download will
be updatet to 20Mbit with no additional cost) and all for 45 Euro per
month and it's not the cheaper service here... but some place can get
better or similar from other ISP for less.

I'm afraid that on my site it doesn't show any entries in the "existing
tags" lists in any of the fields.

Message-ID: <2BF9D2B7-278D-48A7-A2F7-DA2BC6E94162@gmail.com>



wp_get_object_terms accepts arrays of object ids and taxonomies  
(awesome!), but the apparently parallel function,  
get_object_term_cache, doesn't.

Is this intentional, or would a patch be welcome?

(I may have not done the right search, but I couldn't find anything  
in Trac on it.)

"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies and statistics"

This is a great topic.  I am sure the effort will produce interesting
statistics.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure it will produce actionable
information.  Self selecting surveys are less meaningful then other
approaches.  My fear is that you are producing a plugin that will be
installed by a subset of users and of that subset, another subset will opt
in.  You don't need a large sample size to draw conclusions about the
population as long as the sample is truly representative of the population.
Allowing people to opt in or out means you will have a (relatively) small
sample size that probably does not reflect the entirety of the Wordpress
installations in the world.

I would still find the information interesting - I just don't think you can
make decisions driven by what the 'average' WP user has installed.  You
won't know much about the average WP user - only those who like contributing
towards these kinds of efforts - like myself ;-)

And even worse are assumptions! IMHO there are three scenarios:
1) No one sends data: There won't be reasonable results. The experiment 
has failed. No harm done. (IMO unlikely but who knows)
2) Most of the people send data: This does help a lot. It quickly gives 
an overview which features might need integration or whether it makes 
sense to ship a bundled version.
3) All users have to submit data and don't have a choice: A lot of 
bloggers are about security and will complain. I don't think they have a 
problem with sending statistical data but with not having the choice to 
do so. (I am one of them) This will give WP bad press.
4) No statistical data is collected. Worst case! Nothing gained at all.

At the moment I can't come up with other scenarios. I vote for giving it 
a try and let the user choose. After all. If he doesn't want to help he 
can't complain later on.

Yes, I have in fact, and what I'm saying is entirely true. It's just
that very few people here are getting it. Alex's own numbers prove me
correct:

285,305 bytes vs. 256,051 bytes. Packing his JS saved him all of 29k
or so. And that's *total*, mind you, this is not the savings on any
one page load.

Furthermore, the given suggestion of combining all of a page's JS into
one file transmission eliminates all benefits from browser side
caching of the JS files.

This entire conversation falls into the realm of premature
optimization. There's no substanial benefit for WordPress to pack the
JS files it uses. Consider that almost all of these files are
libraries acquired from elsewhere. If they offer a packed version
directly, fine, use that. However, packing them ourselves will a)
probably break things and b) require us to repack and retest them
every time we upgrade to a new version. It's not worth it.

If you want to pack your own JS, do it. If you want to make a plugin
to pack the JS files for users, do that. But this is outside the scope
of the core code.

How is this self selecting? (Assuming this goes into core and not into a

Will you agree that there is very little correlation between how the

Judging by my own efforts to collect such data, I can tell that between 
10 to 20 percent of the users installing FireStats agrees to send 
anonymous statistical information.
this is surely high enough to draw conclusions about many things.

As far as enclosures go, does the patch on this ticket do what you need:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3405

Hooks are another issue and we certainly could have more of those in  
the XML-RPC code.

I agree, that's why I'm for asking users to opt-out and sending the data 
in an anonymous format. That way we should get fairly representative 
data from the broadest possible userbase. If the data is anonymous, 
there are no privacy issues.

Cheers - Callum.

Here, my friend, it's you failing to understand previous discussion
entries:
a) It was mentioned a couple of times in this discussion that there are
save packers like YUI.
b) Packing is a matter of a few seconds, and it can be automated.
Switching can be done at code level with a little global variable or
constant attached to the file name to include.

I disagree.

The fact is, as I already mentioned, that a large part of WP users has
not the ability to use gzip or similar technologies. And we saw during
this discussion so far that fat bandwidth is by no means a standard
these days. I also agree that JS is rather an issue of the admin area,
but especially for multi-user communities based on WPMU, it could be
nice to try some optimization.

To summarize the discussion a bit, there are various possible methods to
improve the performance of JS transmission to the client:

- compression (mod_gzip, php_gzip or similar)
  * advantages: smaller amount of data to transfer
  * disadvantages:
    - slight overhead of packing and unpacking,
    - not available on many hosts
- packing (D.E.'s packer, YUI, others)
  * advantages: smaller amount of data to transfer, especially where
    real compression is not an option
  * disadvantages: bad packers can break JS syntax and API
  * countermeasures:
    - use a save packer
    - fix JS with a packer in mind
    - fix the packed JS
    - apply packing only to some files
- merging into one file
  * advantages:
    - reduce number of HTTP requests
    - allows even better compressing as well as packing
  * disadvantages: needs remodeling of the core JS management
  * contermeasures: evalutate if it's worth it; if so, do it

Apart from that, we have:
- selecting only required JS
  * is mostly done already, at least in the newer series
- Avoid inline JS
  * deliver JS in dedicated files
- support proper client-side caching
  * mostly an issue of HTTP headers, the appended version string is
    useless until the server sends the proper headers
  * related to merging all JS into one file, because JS must run through
    WP before output

I agree that not *everything* of this must be core features. However,
you won't accomplish most of these features if you don't have the proper
interfaces in the core.

And, Otto, just because something is beyond your imagination, you don't
have to oppose it.


Kind regards,
Alex

Thanks. You're made me realize that arguing with you on any sort of
real level is actually futile, because you instantly dismiss anybody
who disagrees with you.

When you want to have a real discussion and not hurl insults at me, I

For everybody who's not Alex, here's my main argument:

Methods of optimizing javascript induced bandwidth:

1. GZIP type compression.
Advantages:
- Works on all hosts that WordPress works on, if you do it using PHP.
- Provides way more improvement than anything else (>90%)
- Works with all modern browsers.
Disadvantages:
- Requires caching on the server side to eliminate extraneous CPU use
(think of like WP-Cache for javascript).
- Won't work with some older browsers, but these are like <1% of the
total population of browsers.

2. Javascript compression.
Advantages:
- Compresses javascript in a way that will eliminate any need for any
server work of any kind.
- Can be made "safe" at the cost of making better optimizations.
Disadvantages:
- Only provides a ~50% improvement.
- Provides less than a 3% improvement if done in combination with GZIP
like compression.
- Adds extra maintenance overhead to the development side of things
(have to maintain compressed and decompressed versions, have to keep
them in sync, etc).
- Slows down client side processing by a measurable and non-trivial amount.

3. Combining multiple files into one
Advantages:
- Reduces HTTP overhead, which improves visible speed quite a bit for
a large number of files.
Disadvantages:
- Eliminates all the effects of browser caching. Now, instead of not
downloading files it already has, the browser will get those files
every time, since the file is combined with others. This can result in
a substantial bandwidth *increase* if not done carefully and
correctly. It's actually a deoptimization in many cases, and should be
used only where it makes sense. TinyMCE uses it because it makes sense
to do so there. It does not necessarily make sense in a global
perspective.

And there you go.

Self selecting means I can choose to participate or not.  Because I am
interested in the results, I'm likely to participate (and will).  All of us
who find the subject will end up participating.  Those other people who are
too busy, or too paranoid or too something else won't participate.  In this
case, self selecting means it is not random.  Because people like me are
more likely to participate then the general population we skew the results
to represent people more like me - and less like the general population.

Don't get me wrong - I will be interested in seeing the results. I just
don't think you can use the results to say PHP4, or PHP5, or SwiftMail or
PHPMail or anything else is the right or wrong architecture direction.  I
look forward to seeing the results of your work.  I'm really only commenting
on one specific use of the data you  produce - not the idea behind
collecting information.

I'm not sure that coming up with a naming scheme is that big a problem.
Something like:

http://whatever.com/blog/wp-includes/jsgzip.php?jQuery=1.2&Prototype=1.2&Mootools=1.0

Or even use the files last modified date: jQuery=5-5-2007 etc, in case
something changes.

There would be an issue with what to do on the client side if a
particular lib is only used on one page. For example, on my blog I was
using a plugin that relied on Prototype for a while that was used on
every page, and a contact form plugin that relies on jQuery. So on the
contact page I'd have ended up sending a separate copy of the
Prototype.js files, that was included with jQuery. In this case, it
would be more efficient to not combine the two files.

So basically in order to make a concatenating system make sense, there
would need to be a way to add libraries to a site wide queue that is
separate from the single request queue (the way that hook works now) -
maybe there aught to also be separate way to queue up admin wide, and
public wide packages as well (since there are probably usually more libs
used in the admin than in the regular site).

I guess the question is, is it worth all that effort just to slight
reduce the number of connections for js libs (there honestly aren't
_that_ many of them).

Anyway, gzipping the javascript, and adding some better expiry is a good
place to start. The same could be done for css files (is there a queue
function for css?).

Hm, I've read the article, but there's not too much new in it. That guy
seems to receive quite recognition with a PR of 7. ;-) However, he seems
not to have heard of Prototype, Mootools, jQuery etc. -- because these
are the frameworks he's talking about. It's a couple of them and not
one, and that's good. One emphasizes XHR/AJAX, one is for effects,
another one is designed to be slim and fast, others have their purposes.

One important thing to quote from the article, though:
"History, though, is repeating itself. Bandwidth is getting cheaper.
People are figuring out how to precompile JavaScript."

Well, this is exactly our discussion. Bandwidth does get more and
cheaper, but not everywhere and for everyone. By the way, I hate people
who rely on Moore's Law -- because it always forces people to spend
money on new devices, throw away the old ones (producing tons of toxic
waste) and ignoring those who are happy with their running systems.

The question is not how fast today's amount of data will be acceptable,
but it is more complex: What are the efforts? What's the benefit? Will
the benefit be long-term? The author is right with his example regarding
rewriting Assembler code (though I think that in the 80s and 90s no one
would write end user apps in Assembler anymore).

However, we're talking about "compiling" JavaScipt here: (a) it's easy
to automate, (b) tools  to perform this task exist, (c) there's a
long-term benefit, because the total amount of JS code in WP also grows
steadily (remember the figures posted previously). The actual work would
be to prepare the base application, as outlined in my previous mail. I
think if we discuss whether or not (and how) to optimize the JS handling
of WordPress, this should be kept in mind.


Kind regards,
Alex

Most of that article makes sense, but only for things that require effort.

I think I spent about a 15 minutes making a build script that compresses and
combines the JavaScript for Objecty, and before that I'd never needed to
make a Linux shell script in my life.

Okay. So now you have to run that build script every time you upgrade
the javascript. And you have to modify that build script if those
upgrades add new files. Essentially, you have to maintain that script
along with the javascript files themselves.

Wouldn't it make a whole lot more sense to simply get the pre-made
compressed versions of whatever you're compressing?

I mean, jQuery comes with compressed versions. WordPress uses them.
Prototype doesn't, but others maintain compressed up-to-date versions
of it. Ditto Scriptaculous. Why should WordPress maintain its own
compression schemes when it can simply use other projects directly?
Why reinvent the wheel?

So far, the best script I've seen regarding serving JS (and CSS) is to
be found here:
<http://rakaz.nl/item/make_your_pages_load_faster_by_combining_and_compressing_javascript_and_css_files>
Handles 304, Etags, browsers' inconsistencies etc.. It concatenates
and gzip stuff, reducing both the number of queries and the bandwidth
used, with a minimal CPU overhead

I implement something based on this on every site & theme I do now,
it's really great

These are good points. In the US, if you use the cheap DSL packages
(Verizon offers one for 14.95 or something), latency and the number of
simultaneous connections can be a problem. I could be wrong, but I think
they are limitted to 4 total simultaneous connections - bittorrents are
dog slow on those packages, and loading multiple sites is a real killer.
Surfing the net while downloading anything large can even be unbearable
(granted, those problems could have been specific to my experience with
it, but I do remember reading about those connection limits somewhere).

Anything that reduces round trips to the server can be a god send for a
connection like that.

It can be made completely safe without any optimization cost as long as you
also use GZIP (see below).

Here's a RealLife(tm) example that may make you reconsider:

    File                                File size      GZIPd file size

    Original jQuery library             62,885 bytes   19,758 bytes
    jQuery minified w/ JSMin            36,391 bytes   11,541 bytes
    jQuery minified w/ Packer           21,557 bytes   11,119 bytes
    jQuery minified w/ YUI Compressor   31,822 bytes   10,818 bytes

So with the YUI Compressor (my recommendation) example, JavaScript
compression provides a ~50% improvement (as you say), but GZIPing that
provides /another/ ~50% improvement over GZIPing alone.

There's fallback solutions like alternate contents (via "Vary" header).

Much better than nothing, on hosts where gzip is not an option.

You can still do caching, with some sort of versioning, similar to the
way it's already done in WP. One can e.g. combine different version in
an appended versions hash and/or use an ETag HTTP header (if the server
doesn't issue one automatically). I bet that the number of possible

I have to admit I don't understand why it would make sense for TinyMCE,
yet not for, let's say, the files in the wp-includes/ base directory.

Actually, I already posted a command line (call it script, if you want)
to automatically pack all JS files in the WP core. With a slight
adaption, you can use the packer of your choice instead of the one I
used in my examples.

That's damned clever. I like that a lot. With a little modification to
allow it to cache the gzip compressed document and to eliminate the
concatenation, that could be used anywhere. I might work that into my
site this evening and see what impact it has.

I don't like his .htaccess rules though, he's relying on the files
being in the right directories. With only minor modifications, it
could be made to work with any JS or CSS file on the whole site.

Analyse your numbers again:
GZIP only: 19758 / 62885 = 0.314... = 69% improvement.
YUI+GZIP: 10818 / 62885 = 0.172... = 83% improvement.
Total improvement YUI+GZIP gives over GZIP only: 83 - 69 = 14%

Okay, so YUI gives a 14% improvement, which is more than my
guesstimate of 3%. Fine. But is it worth it? My opinion is still no
due to the maintenance overhead.

True, but you have to be careful that solutions like this properly set the
cache control headers so that the requested files get cached by the browser.

IMHO: for the end-users, maybe not. But for the server, where the numbers
can quickly tally up, yes.

Just my two cents though.

First of all, I am not working on this (to many things to do with to
little time).

what I proposed was to include this into the core, and have WordPress
ask users "do you agree to send anonymous system information?".

users that are to busy to answer "yes" or "no" will just be asked again
and again and again.

people who ara paranoid/scared/whatever will simply never agree and this
will ensure their privacy is not violated in any way.  but it's safe to
assume they they are evenly distributed among WP Users :), so hopefully
they will not effect the percentages of the measurements.


since I already implemented something very similar for my own project, I
am willing to technically  assist whoever willing to pick this up and
implement it. (it took me a single evening to implement, and this
included some research as to the best way to transmit the data to the
server, so it's really not a big deal).

Only thing to keep in mind is if you ever switch to another plugin, you'll
have your old posts looking different.

I'm not 100% familiar with the details of the cache control header,
but what more would you need than Cache-Control: public?

Also, that given script
(http://rakaz.nl/projects/combine/combine.phps) does include server
side caching of compressed data (I missed it earlier), but it doesn't
send any sort of Cache-Control header.

Another option would be to store the GeShi result in the
"post_content_filtered" field, which is still part of the posts table.

Whenever somebody requests the content, you return the filtered content by
hooking into the required filters.

If you deactivate the plugin, the original (unprocessed) content is once
again used. And you can even use the deactivate hook to clean up your
post_content_filtered data. (And genereate it for already existing posts
on activate)

The statistics nerd in me is forcing me to protest. :-)

-If you're saying that YUI adds 50% improvement to whatever, then
that's fine. It's pretty close to that number both ways.
-But if you're saying that it adds 50% improvement over GZIP, then
that's not fine, because it doesn't. It adds 14% improvement in the
given case, like I stated.

It's just that you're comparing the wrong things to give that
particular statistic that you're giving. YUI is not a 50% improvement
over GZIP, it's a 50% improvement over GZIP *when combined with GZIP
as well*. These are different statements.

> I just personally don't tend to pass on near-effortless ways to reduce

I don't consider it effortless, I consider it effort-full because of
the maintenance overhead. Yes, it's effortless to you and your site.
However maintaining the core code of a package like WordPress is not
just about you and your one site. Compressing all the JS with YUI
would involve keeping two sets of JS in the core distribution, one
compressed, one not. It would make debugging more difficult. It would
make updating the core with new versions of these libraries harder.
And it would introduce the *possibility* of incompatible compressed
code (such a thing is *always* possible, no matter what you think
about YUI... bugs can creep into any piece of code, which YUI is).

And like it has been stated, creating a plugin that would
automatically run YUI or whatever-the-heck-you-want on the JS files
would be rather trivial. Why not make such a plugin? If it proves
popular, then the core people will likely steal it for the main code.

This is from <http://www.julienlecomte.net/blogfiles/gz.phps>, which I know
works:

  /*
   * Set the HTTP response headers that will
   * tell the client to cache the resource.
   */

  $file_last_modified = filemtime( $src_uri );
  header( "Last-Modified: " . date( "r", $file_last_modified ) );

  $max_age = 300 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 300 days

  $expires = $file_last_modified + $max_age;
  header( "Expires: " . date( "r", $expires ) );

  $etag = dechex( $file_last_modified );
  header( "ETag: " . $etag );

  $cache_control = "must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=" . $max_age
. ", s-maxage=" . $max_age;
  header( "Cache-Control: " . $cache_control );

That's what I thought I said.   :^)   I guess I didn't get your numbers
before because I've never deployed JavaScript uncompressed using one or more
methods.

I made it effortless with my own build system, so I thought the same
principles would apply.  I understand your points, thanks!

wp_get_object_terms accepts multiple ids and taxonomies to allow
slurping lots of stuff in one query.  get_object_term_cache doesn't
have the same motivation since it is retrieving what has already been
queried.  I'm not against adding support for multiples to
get_object_term_cache, however, if it is useful to you.  It's too late
to change it in 2.3 though. It would have to wait for 2.4.

I imagine that this would be relatively easy to accomplish with a plugin
(set a database option with a timestamp on each page load for the logged in
user).  I don't know the hook you'd want to use for that.  I wouldn't be
surprised if someone has already written this plugin, though.

I'm using the taxonomy to store specific metadata related to books  
and library resources.  So for a single record I've got a bunch of  
terms in taxonomies like Author, Subject, ISBN, and others, and what  
I wanted to do was grab all of them in one call.

I've worked around it pretty easily by reading $object_term_cache  
directly (this may or may not be recommended behavior):

$tags = array_intersect_key($object_term_cache[$blog_id][$id],  
array_flip($this->facets));

Where $this->facets is the array of taxonomies I care about.

Overall, though, I'm really happy with what I can do with all this.

So, upon activation on RC1, the plugin complains that:

You must not have uploaded wp-includes/functions.php, or the plugin  
is calling a manual SQL query.  'option_description' isn't used when  
you use the options API.

Oops, it's not actually your plugin that does this. Sorry for the noise :)

Hi all,

Thanks for all the nice suggestions and comments. I have now made the final
adjustments to the ajax page ordering functionality, including some of the
suggestions given and with all the bugs fixed (hopefully). It is now paging
at 20 items (I found it to be the ideal balance, but changing this number
takes no effort). The animation is now a "fade in/fade out" effect, which I
think looks less aggressive/jumpy, but that can be changed very easily as
well.

I put it together in two ways: a complete wordpress package (
http://www.bernardopadua.com/wordpress/downloads/wordpress_with_page_ordering_19_september_2007.zip)
and a patch (
http://www.bernardopadua.com/wordpress/patches/ajax%20sortable%20pages%20for%20wp.19-09-07.patch).
I have updated my sandbox (
http://bernardopadua.com/wp-sandbox/19-sep-2007/wp-admin/edit-pages.php)
where you guys can test it (user: test / pass: test).

Please, check this post for more information:
http://bitsinashortbit.wordpress.com/2007/09/16/the-final-bits-of-gsoc/

If you are interested in using the jQuery plugins that were developed to
provide this functionality, take a look at:

Cheers,

Bernardo

I'm writing my first serious plugin and I'd like to overide the normal

some particular content at a URL like the following.

http://www.mywpblog.org.uk/?confirm=12345

What hook/action do I need to be looking at to achieve this?

The template_redirect hook will replace the actual output with yours.

<?php
function mycontent() {
	if ('bar' == $_GET['foo']) {
		?>
		<html>
			<head>
				<title>foo</title>
			</head>
			<body>
			foobar
			</body>
		</html>
		<?php
		exit; // important!
	}
}
add_action('template_redirect', 'mycontent');
?>


Kind regards,
Alex

Maybe you should download and read these:

There should always be a decent amount of research before writing the 
first line of code. :-)

That's almost, but not quite what I'm looking for. I'd like to output a
'page' in the style of the selected theme's page.php rather than one
I've written myself. Something like the following pseudo-code.

function mycontent() {
	if ('bar' == $_GET['foo']) {
		output_page(current_theme,$mypage_title,$mypage_content);
	}
}

I understand; unfortunately, that's not so simple. You see, when
WordPress receives a request, it will first determine what resource you
request (page, post, etc.), then select the template. It will also issue
a database query, create the content elements and run them through their
standard filters. After that, it will include the theme files and
execute the template functions herein.

This means for your plugin: You can either manipulate the output of one
or more *single* template functions (title, post/page content, comment
data, etc.), for example by modifying the DB query or using the API
filters. Or you can use a hook like template_redirect to replace the
content entirely.

However, you cannot "carve out" the middle of the template and fill it
with your stuff. You *could* find out which is the theme in use, include
its files and try to replace the main content section with a simple
parser. It might work for a couple of popular and/or standardized
themes, but it will fail on a large number of themes, simply because
there is not such a thing as a defined main section.

This means, you can replace the content and the header with whatever you
like, but the structure of the outcoming document will remain the same;
i.e. your replacements will still be at the same position as given in
the theme's template.

Kind regards,
Alex

Thanks. I'm going to do the confirmation in a slightly different manner
that avoids the problem.

Message-ID: <46F26167.10004@automattic.com>

Hi,

Those interested in unit testing testing might want to take at 
wordpress-tests, a test automation engine for Wordpress:

	http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-tests

Though it can be used for unit testing, strictly speaking it's an 
automated regression test system.  Tests are run against a (more or 
less) fully functioning, freshly installed copy of Wordpress or 
Wordpress-mu, database and all (as opposed to the mock object unit 
testing approach taken by Jacob Santos).

The test cases so far (in wp-testcase) are fairly sparse, but should 
give an indication of what's possible.  They all pass against the 
current wordpress trunk.

Basic docs are in the README.  Please read the warnings carefully and 
keep it well separated from production data - this will nuke your database.

Currently it uses PHPUnit 3, from phpunit.de, though it's designed to be 
fairly independent of the unit test framework (it can run on PHPUnit 1 
with minor hacking).

I haven't tried yet, but with a bit of tinkering it can probably run 
Jacob's tests also.

Cheers,
Alex.

WordPress hide PHP notices by default:


from wp-settings.php:
// Change to E_ALL for development/debugging
error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE);

This promotes writing of bad code both in the core and in plugins.


I understand that turning notices back on will break a lot of plugins, 
but maybe it's worth doing this for the next major version.

having notice turned on helps to catch a lot of problems early in the 
development, and will actually help plugin authors write better plugins


what do you guys think?

I just turn them all on on my dev box.

That way if a user has two plugins that are conflicting mildly and would
throw a warning but not break their site, they don't get a bunch of php text
at the top of their page.

It would be great to have some kind of debugging mode. Maybe setting 
some special cookie so the "normal" users of your blog are not affected. 
You normally don't want them to see any errors.
That would also help helping users remotely. Of course it should be easy 
to activate this (not having to mess around with files).

When you say "all modern browsers", are you including browsers such  
as are found on mobile devices?  The iPhone seems to have set the new  
standard for mobile browsers (or maybe i should say "raised the  
bar"), and I think a lot more people will be using these or similar  
to blog in the future.

(as has been recently discussed on this list regarding making an  
iPhone WP interface.  Really, the iPhone handles the existing  
interface amazingly well as it is.)

By the time the template_redirect hook is triggered, WP has already  
queried the DB, found the page, and set the object cache. Your plugin  
could manipulate the cache, changing the content of the page.

One more question:  Don't browsers cache javascript files?  Which to  
my mind means that this would be (at worst) slow the first time you  
load the page, but on subsequent loads it would pull from cache.

Cache meaning:
No http requests
No bandwidth

My understanding of this may be rough, so feel free to correct me. :)

Partially correct. If you want to change the query, you must indeed use
the 'init' hook, as template_redirect is too late. But if you want to
change the content, i.e. the output of the template functions, you
simply need to use one or more of the filters.

Message-ID: <545AEF89-6791-45AF-A632-8E0E9846408D@b5media.com>

There is a question I'm getting a lot as I've been doing some  
promotion of the next release of WordPress. The topic of built in  
tags and whether UTW and the other tagging plugins will still work  
with WP 2.3. The recommended approach, at least from my perspective,  
is to disable tag plugins and use the WP tags but there are  
legitimate reasons why some users might want to use one of the  
existing tag plugins. Can anyone clarify for me what can be expected  
to happen with these other tagging plugins. Will they still work,  
should a blogger choose, along side WP tags since they use different  
tables?

Depends on server and client settings. If a server sends the proper
headers, and if the client has a strong caching policy, then you can
generally say yes. But my estimate is that on a large part of
constellations, there is no or suboptimal caching.

It's hard for me to provide actual figures, because I can only say what
I experience with my server and my browsers. I have an Apache 2.2.6
server with quite an out-of-the-box configuration, with regard to
caching. My browers are Konqueror 3.5.7 and FF 2.0.0.6 on Linux. I have
set them both to caching, however none of them seem to cache JavaScript
files. For example, in Firefox, you can see cached files with
about:cache, and there's not a single JS file in my list. Maybe others
could also test and then post their server/client caching experience.

I think caching could be optimized with a combination of Cache-Control,
Expires, Last-Modified headers, and an appended version string to the JS
file. But for this, the JS file would have to be handled by WordPress to
modify the headers. Another cache optimization are If-None-Match and
ETag headers, although (a) they are rather the server's business, (b)
they require HTTP/1.1 and (c) they don't reduce the number of requests,
only the amount of data.

Kind regards,
Alex

Correction: There actually are cached, I forgot to look into the disk
cache.

Anyway: I have run a test with Wireshark, because I had the feeling that
the number of requests wasn't lower. And indeed: Firefox still issues
the requests, now with If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match headers, and
it receives 304. Bottom line: The number of data transferred is indeed
lower, the number of requests is not reduced -- at least for me.

You can't count on the client supporting this, which is why the server does
the compression based on a negotiation between it and the client.

If the client doesn't support it, the server doesn't gzip/deflate.

Well done Bernardo - it looks good!
As it will not be a plugin (for reasons I understand), I hope it gets 
accepted into core, as there are too many file changes to patch and 
keep  correct as deifferent WP versions are rolled out.

That's true for one session, but when you say "first time" remember that
stuff gets pushed out of your viewer's caches quite often.

According to Yahoo, 20% of all page views are done with an empty cache, and
40-60% of the people hitting their page have an "empty cache experience".

+1 on that.  This should be considered for core.

If they don't, it won't be because of the existence of "proper" tag  
support in WP... it'll just be because of typical interbranch  
differences.  For instance, if UTW is looking for the old categories  
tables (maybe for cat-to-tag conversion -- just a hypothetical), then  
that part wouldn't work.

But if people want to keep using third party tagging solutions until  
plugins are developed to flesh out the functionality of WP's own  
tagging system, that should probably work just fine.  The conversion  
from other tagging systems doesn't happen automatically -- it is  
triggered manually through the Import screen.

UTW as-is, is being disbanded in wordpress 2.3;  but its interesting
functionality* is being split off into smaller, more managable plugins.

*suggestions [is on wordpress.org], admin [is with my beta testers] and
rendering [is causing me to pull my hair out].  There might be others (:

Just FYI: UTW and WP 2.3 share some function names, so you should advise
people to remove UTW before upgrading, or you'll get a bunch of fatal
errors.......

-1 to having notices on the average user. It can break header() redirects
and all that stuff.

+100 to us all having it on (my PHP install is setup to show them) so we
code cleanly.

I agree, Maybe turning notices on for the trunk and then turning them off in time for the next beta's?
Best of both worlds there (Allthough plugin developers are more likely to use betas to test plugins..)

Agreed. I rarely try to push b5media influence on this list, but with 300 blogs, at least 2/3 use UTW. If we can't take into account the large number of blogs using UTW with this upgrade, then we are likely not going to be able to upgrade anytime soon. The process is tedious and difficult if we are going to force manual intervention.

In addition, can you imagine the net effect on support for "broken" blogs with people who do not understand their role in the smooth migration to a new version - where upgrade instructions at their most vicious are to delete everything except wp-config.php and wp-content?

Hi,

I have fixed a bug that was probably causing your problem -- it had to 
do with having apostrophes (') in tags. It should work better now if 
you download again from:

http://www.poplarware.com/tagplugin.html

Thanks again for testing and letting me know it wasn't working.

Regards,
     Jennifer

Sounds like a good solution.

Well maybe we should turn off debugging just in the final release. 
Anyone that is testing betas should know the risk of running beta 
software. Having it on until release will allow better plugin writing 
(since they'll fix all of the notices before release) and as said 
before, it would probably improve core code stability and all that fun 
stuff.

or better still, instead move the debug settings to wp-config.php like gallery2 does so we can turn them off and on depending on the role of the site..

Message-ID: <b88434820709202117u4d51588ap62eea0066ee65261@mail.gmail.com>

With WP's pseudo-cron, is it possible to set the time of which the event
should reoccur? Like if I wanted the event to happen at midnight (or
whenever the first person to visit after that) everyday.

Thanks,
Matt

Yes.  The timestamp for the particular time of day is the first
argument in wp_schedule_event for example.

Ah, right thanks.

There's like no documentation on using WP's pseudo-cron.

I was exactly going to suggest this. It should be up to the blogger to
enable error reporting.

I suggest something like the following, to avoid clutterring of wp-config.php
-> in wp-settings:
if (defined('WPDEBUG') and WPDEBUG == true) {
    error_reporting(E_ALL);
} else {
    error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE);
}

-> in wp-config, optional define('WPDEBUG', true) for developpers

I love the plethora of new options in WP-Config :D - from the site URI to
the DB encoding, I love it all :-)

I think it's safe to say that UTW is one of the most popular plugins for
serious bloggers (who aren't necessarily techy) ever (awesome job,
Christine!).

If there is a fully working UTW-importer, would it be totally out of the
question to add a UTW routine to the 2.3 upgrade code?

Something like: Check if UTW is installed. If yes, disable it and start the
UTW importer at the end of the 2.3 upgrade?

I think - so long as the UTW importer is part of the core - that shouldn't
be a problem.

Just my two cents.

More specifically, disable UTW, and then give the user an explanation  
and ASK them if they want to run the importer.  Otherwise, great  
idea. :)

Would you consider writing some documentation for wp_schedule_event on

Really? I didn't think that the new cron stuff was complicated enough
to even need documentation. It was just obvious, sort of thing.

Here's the gist of it:
Parameters: All functions.

$timestamp - Refers to the time the job will run. The job will run at
the next time the page is accessed after this timestamp. Create it
using standard php time functions, like time() or str_to_time() or
whatever. In other words, this should be a unix timestamp value.

$hook - The action hook to activate. wp-cron doesn't run functions, it
activates action hooks. You create your functions and then create your
own hooks with add_action('my_hook','my_function').

$args - an array of arguments to pass to the actions. Optional, of course.

$recurrance - For repeating events, how often the event should be run.
This can be 'hourly' or 'daily', or you can add your own repeating
values by modifying the array given to you with the cron_schedules
filter.

The functions:

function wp_schedule_single_event( $timestamp, $hook, $args = array())
- Schedules a one time event. At $timestamp, $hook will be called with
do_action.

function wp_schedule_event( $timestamp, $recurrence, $hook, $args =
array()) - Schedules a recurring event.

function wp_reschedule_event( $timestamp, $recurrence, $hook, $args =
array()) - Reschedules a given event. There's not a lot of reasons to
use this.

function wp_unschedule_event( $timestamp, $hook, $args = array() ) -
Unschedules a specific event. Also not a lot of reason to use this.

function wp_clear_scheduled_hook( $hook ) - Unschedules an event even
if you don't know when it's scheduled. This simply kills all events
that will trigger the given $hook. This is very useful.

function wp_next_scheduled( $hook, $args = array() ) - returns the
$timestamp of when a given event will run, given the known hook and
args for it.

function spawn_cron() - Never call this, used internally.

function wp_cron() - Never call this, used internally.

function wp_get_schedules() - Used internally to get the list of
recurring schedules. If you add a filter to 'cron_schedules', you can
modify this to have your own repeating schedule values.

function wp_get_schedule($hook, $args = array()) - Not really any good
reason to use this, but it can get you the recurrence value for a
given hook/args set.



Pretty straightforward, I thought. What part in particular is giving you issues?

Maybe an example would be useful.

Basic one time event:

function do_this_once() {
// do something
}
add_action('my_one_timer','do_this_once');
wp_schedule_single_event(time()+60, 'my_one_timer');

And that's it. That will schedule your one time event to run in one
minute from "now".

Basic repeating event:
function do_this_hourly() {
// do something
}
add_action('my_hourly_event','do_this_hourly');
wp_schedule_event(time()+60, 'hourly', 'my_hourly_event');

Pretty straightforward. Of course, you don't want to run this
directly, you want it to only schedule once, probably on plugin
activation. If you have it run every time, then you start scheduling
tons of stuff over and over again.

Hi all,

I'm looking to do a primary school website using Wordpress. Can anyone
recommend a good theme/template to get me started?

It will need some calendaring functionality. I've had a quick look on the
ThemeViewer site, but didn't spot anything obvious.

I guess I'm looking for something bright and fun!

Thanks in advance

Maybe you'll like the d-kret theme:
http://diekretzschmars.de/dkret-theme/

It's been created by -- a teacher. And it's a very nice and bright
theme.

Geez ... do they still *seriously* attach that stuff? ;-)

I just took what Otto just sent into the list for examples and usage, 
and put it into this page. Going to make similar doc pages for the 
other cron functions shortly...

Otto --

It looks like (from reading the code) for the unschedule, reschedule, 
and clear functions, you need to know the exact function arguments you 
originally created the schedule with (if any).  And for this function:

> function wp_clear_scheduled_hook( $hook ) - Unschedules an event even
> if you don't know when it's scheduled. This simply kills all events
> that will trigger the given $hook. This is very useful.

You actually call it with
     wp_clear_scheduled_hook( $hook, $arg1, $arg2, ... )

If you leave out the arguments, or they don't match, it looks to me as 
though the schedule will not be cleared.

Correct?

Ahh, yes, you're correct about the arguments to
wp_clear_scheduled_hook. Never noticed that the used func_get_args()
there before now. Seems weird, given that the rest of the functions
work differently.

You're also correct about the arguments needing to be exact. The
arguments are used to build a key which is used internally by wp-cron.
Without the exact arguments, it won't find the entry in the cron
option array.

Thing is, I've never actually attempted to use wp-cron while passing
arguments to the functions before. Never had a need to do so.

Still, I expect that if you're the one to originally schedule the
event, you would arguably know the arguments you called it with and
therefore would be able to unschedule it as well.

Instead of

wp_schedule_event(time(), 'hourly', 'my_hourly_event');

A helpful syntax would be:
wp_schedule_event(0, 'hourly', 'my_hourly_event');

If you use 0 you end up with a stuck event in the table.

I know this because I built a dashboard viewer for cron entries. It'd be
neat if it could become bundled and turned into a cron entry editor.

 From the name of this function, I thought it would first unschedule 
the originally-scheduled event, then put it into the schedule again. 
But looking at the code, it looks to me as though all this function 
does is make sure that $timestamp is in the future, and then call 
wp_schedule_event. Am I missing something?

Hmm... Maybe my description was incorrect. From what I see, it will
schedule a new event at first point in time that's in the future,
given a starting point and a recurrance interval.

Normally, if I schedule something in the past, it will run on the very
next hit to the site. But this function will push that interval in
there up to the point where it schedules in the future, at the next
correct time given the starting point and the interval.

I'm uncertain if that's intended behavior or not. If it is, then the
function name is pretty poorly chosen.

That doesn't seem correct. Looking through the code, zero should work
okay. Obviously, it will run the very next hit, but it should work
fine as far as I can see.

Do you have this released as a plugin? Probably not very many casual 
WP users would want to look at their cron entries, but it seems like 
it would be useful for plugin developers.

Okay, I see what I was missing now.

wp_reschedule_event is used by wp-cron.php. When a recurring event is
scheduled, it calls this function to schedule the next recurring
event.

This means that for any recurring event, only the next recurrance of
it is actually scheduled. When the event finally gets around to
running, wp-cron reschedules it by creating a new event in the future,
then it unschedules the existing event, then it runs the hook.

This also means that calling wp_unschedule_event on a recurring one
unschedules the whole event, recurrances and all.

Will you be doing a final 2.3-compatible release before disbanding?   
ComputerGuru mentions function collisions, which will make it hard  
for people to do tag upgrades unless they disable the plugin first.   
And some people may not want to immediately upgrade to using WP tags,  
but wait until some of the UTW functionality has been implemented for  
WP tags.

Ah. Much clearer.

So why have two functions to unschedule -- unschedule and clear, if 
they do the same thing?

Thank you for the nice plugin, Jennifer !
I'm very happy to find a function to edit a tag slug.:-)

BTW, I found a bug that a Japanese word (probably Korean and Chinese
too) in the native tag field displayed encoded like "%e3%81%82".

To reproduce:
1. enable TagEntry plugin
2. go to the edit post window
3. copy "?????" to the native tag field and click "Save and Continue Editing"
      I think it's displayed like
"%e3%81%82%e3%81%84%e3%81%86%e3%81%88%e3%81%8a".
4. Then, turn off the plugin and go back to the edit post window
again, you will find "?????" there.

I've tried it on the trunk (revision 19516) with Tag Entry 1.01.

Thanks again for the plugin!

Howdy all,
Is anyone else seeing circumstances in which all new pages are morphed
into unpublished posts when "published" from the Manage Pages screen?

This is on a blog that has only ever existed on 2.3 betas onwards and
I have minimal plugins active (Akismet, Page Links To, wp-cache, Bad
Behavior and Share This).

Aha!  Ne'ermind.  Looks like Mark's Page Links To plugin is at fault.
It's hooking into the page saving code and b0rking something along the
way.  Pages save with it disabled, and then the link to functionality
works if the plugin is reenabled, but all pages added when the plugin
is active are moved over to draft status in the posts queue.

I can't duplicate this.  Are you using the latest version?  Please  
follow up with me directly so I can get this resolved!

use, wp_clear_scheduled_hook or wp_unschedule_event?

Or just stick error_reporting in wp-config.php with the default, and then
people can edit it if they choose.

I think a constant is better, that way we can use it to enable debug output
on work-in-progress features and such.

Nevermind!  Thought this sounded familiar.  It has nothing to do with  
the plugin, and everything to do with a nasty WordPress bug:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3700

Definitely need to get that fixed in 2.4 -- in the meantime, don't  
add postmeta via AJAX before saving a page for the first time!

without know ANYTHING about the API, I am guessing that you need to use
wp_unschedule_event, and that

wp_clear_scheduled_hook is used internally to notify listeners of
unschedule events.

Back when I was still using UTW and trunk broke it, I was able to continue
using it for a bit by renaming the functions (thank you sed!) and nothing
else.. I don't think anything has changed that would require anything more
than that ATM, UTW could theoretically go on using the old taxonomy tables
and let things be.

But do you *want* to do that? Basically, you're telling people "you don't
need to use the WP taxonomy tables, use this special veriosn of UTW instead"
but then what happens when they want some functionality or the other that
requires compatibility with the wp default taxanomy layout? Wasn't part of
the whole reason of bringing tagging to the core so that we could
standardize it somewhat?

The last time I checked, a clean WP install generated quite a bit of these
notice warnings. Are these to be considered viable trac tickets or by
design?

One of the replies in this thread contains a ticket with patches for those.

Heya,

Pop quiz: anyone knows how to give multiple wp-plugins.org users  
write account to a repo?
Is it just automatic through parsing the accounts listed in the  
contributors tag in the readme?

Searched for a while but can only always find info relevant to  
individual dev, not teams.

Thanks for any tip (even if just the classic sarcastic URL pointer,  
which I might just deserve :p )

Cheers,

Stephane

All that stuff is manually controlled by Matt, I presume.

+1 on a constant.

Also, if you make it something that somebody has to add, rather than  
edit, it becomes far less discoverable for the newer developers.  I  
would put it in the default config file, either commented out or set  
to "false", with an explanatory comment that it's there for  
developers' use.

They don't. The unschedule will unschedule any event, given the
timestamp, hook, and args.

The clear will unschedule any set of events that match just the hook
and args, no need to find out the next timestamp for it.

In other words, I could have the same hook on two different schedules.
Clear would clear them both. Unschedule would let me only get rid of
one of them.

That is incorrect. WP doesn't use such a naming convention (you may be 
thinking of Drupal).

See other email messages in this thread from Otto for correct 
information about these functions. Both unschedule and clear will 
unschedule cron jobs.

Thanks for testing! (That goes for everyone else too -- it is MUCH
appreciated to have a relatively friendly and savvy crowd testing a
plugin before the general public takes its turn.) I'm glad I have
Asian Language support on my box so I could reproduce your problem. :)

Anyway, I think this is fixed now so that Japanese will display
correctly in the Advanced Tag Entry section. However, ATE puts slugs
(rather than tag names, to make sure matching happens correctly when
the post is saved) in the upper Tag entry field, and WP URL-encodes
Japanese characters into %e3 (etc), so you will see strange things in
the standard Tag entry field (the one just under the post content) if
you use ATE and don't define a custom slug when you create a tag.

I've updated the plugin web page to clarify all that, and the new ATE
1.02 is up there too.

I tried it out by checking if wp_next_scheduled_event was the cron. It turns
out that you should you wp_clear_scheduled_hook if you want to completely
get rid of a recursive cron. I think wp_unschedule_event just unschedules
the next time it's supposed to run, but it will continue to run after that
one that's been "skipped".

Message-ID: <b88434820709221233h3ec6686emcab0dedb2f2714a4@mail.gmail.com>

For the plugin update checking in 2.3, does the Plugin URI of the plugin
have to be that of wp.org's? For example, if you have added your plugin to
wp.org, but you have the Plugin URI of the plugin set to your site,
will 2.3still check for updates for it?

a developer who's not wandering into the source must be the kind of
developer who does not care about notices :)

I care about notices, but I've probably only read 20% of the wordpress
core source.  I know when I first looked at wordpress, the constants
defined in wp-config.php stood out as an obvious place to look for
developer-configurable settings.  I shouldn't have to look through
*all* of the code just to find a list of available settings.

Take /etc/ for example.  Most linux config files have commented-out
options assigned to the defaults, which makes it easier to make
modifications.  This is despite the fact that most of those options
are 100% discoverable through man-pages... it's just a courtesy to
sysadmins.

Of course, the version number needs to be there too to check for updates.

Think we can add a page to the codex about these "hidden constants"?

Here's what I have:

define('DB_NAME', 'blog');    // The name of the database
define('DB_USER', 'user');     // Your MySQL username
define('DB_PASSWORD', "pass"); // ...and password
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');    // 99% chance you wont need to change
this value
define('ENABLE_CACHE', true); //WP in-built object cache
define('WP_HOME', 'http://neosmart.net/blog'); //Homepage
define('WP_SITEURL', 'http://neosmart.net/blog'); //Redirected homepage or
something :shrug:
define('DB_CHARSET', ''); //database character set
define('DB_COLLATE', ''); //database collation
define ('WPLANG', 'en_US'); //wordpress localization language
define('ABSPATH', dirname(__FILE__).'/'); //just the location of WP on the
HD
When I need one I look for it, see if it is defined... I think there are
probably some more I haven't looked for yet though....

Hi,
it seems to me that the tags aren't built at the moment. I added a tag
this afternoon (I released a RC) and it still doesn't show up in the

broken or just adding new tags.
Would be nice if this could be fixed before 2.3 is released. I want to

Seems like it is working again. This is odd because I tried to access

Well never mind. Just hope it was my mistake and nothing with the server.

They may rely on some tagging feature that isn't yet available as a  
WP tags enhancer plugin.  But yes, end game is to get people on WP  
tags and have plugins provide administration options that core lacks.

You can point the URL elsewhere.  Note that the bundled Akismet  
plugin points to http://akismet.com/, but update notification still  
works for that.

It has nothing to do with the URI.

Check out the code /wp-admin/includes/update.php. It uses the folder name
and plugin name as well as the version and compares it to the ones hosted on
the WP.org repository.

Er, I take that back. I misread the code, but let me explain further how it
works while I'm at it.

The function grabs your plugins list and sends the whole thing at once to
WordPress.org, regardless of what the URI is of the plugin. WP.org then
parses that, figures out if any of those plugins are hosted at WP.org, and
then returns data on the ones it knows about.

So simply put, if you want update notices, you need to host the plugin at
WP.org and the details of the plugin (author, URI, title, etc.) don't matter
in terms of whether it'll get update checked or not.

Thanks for the clarification. Maybe that should be put in the Codex?

@Mark or anyone: are there any plans to change this and open up the API 
so that plugins hosted elsewhere can benefit? A URL plugin developers 
could specify that returns the latest version seems like it would be all 
that's needed.

Seems a bit of a swizz to lock people into wp.org.

Thanks Jeremy.
Sorry for the delay, I was waiting to see if Matt would pickup on the  
thread.
I assume you meant Matt Mullenweg (sorry still kinda new to the WP  
scene) and emailed him about it.

Sounds like a wiki (@dev.wp-plugin) or codex page contender to me.
I'll give it a shot once I have the info of no one with more exp  
editing the Codex than I picks up on the thread. :)

Cheers,

Stephane

I'm not even sure if many Web hosts permit SMTP at all (easy to use
arbitrary sites as proxies for spamming), esp. with all these botnets
around. You can't rely on or assume availability of SMTP for crucial
services.

Quite the catchup work. :-) Been there on KDE for ages and even in Mac

Hey guys,

I was wondering... one wonderful thing about WordPress is the ability
to adjust the size of the editing box in the "Write" page (via
ordinary settings). One thing that seems to be missing (short of
hacking at code level) is an option that facilitates change to the
size of various bits such as the Categories widget. When scrolling
through 100+ items to tick about 10, where only about 10 fit the
widget's boundaries at any one time, flexibility is lacking and
productivity is low.

I am aware of Matt's resistance to making too many knobs available for
tweaking (let alone hidden configs, as Alex King proposed 2 years
ago), but can any such changes be considered for the trunk?

Thanks in advance,

I'd be open to that.

The prevalence of 100+ category installs should drop once tags are  
bundled.  Very few people actually have a well-maintained 100+  
category hierarchy.  People with that many categories have been use  
categories as a tagging system.

The size of that is set in CSS ... would be a one-line plugin to  
change it.

add_action('admin_head', create_function('', 'echo "<style type=

Wow, it is a good idea to show notices.

I used is_null(), when I should have used isset() for 
_wp_filter_build_unique_id() function.

 From what I can see, there isn't that many notices being generated on 
the homepage.

Clearly these need to be documented, since everybody gets them wrong...

If you schedule any event, even a recurring one, wp_unschedule_event
will get rid of it. Completely. Even recurrances.

If you schedule the same event twice, wp_clear_scheduled_hook will get
rid of both of them. It's also somewhat simpler to use (no need to get
timestamp of next scheduled event).

This is because a recurring event only actually exists once: The next
time. When it runs, it's rescheduled for the next event just before it
actually executes. That's how recurring events work.

In short, you probably always want to use wp_clear_scheduled_hook to
get rid of an event. The only reason you ever want to use
wp_unschedule_event is if you have a complex set of events and want to
be certain that you get rid of get the exact one you want to get rid
of.

Ah, I didn't understand your intent, sorry. Now I got it.

Though, I still prefer a tag name rather than a tag slug in the upper
Tag entry field, because it is easy to confirm current tags when I
edit a post.

Anyway, this plugin is already essential and my favorite :-), I've
made advtagentry-ja.mo, so may I send it to your?

Thanks again for the plugin!

I know this will not change until Monday, but is it really necessary to
transmit the URL? Wouldn't the md5 of the URL do? I know it's easy to
find WP-Blogs via google. But imagine have them all nicely in a database
- All of them. Including version, plugins and so on. If that database
gets public and you find a security bug in one of the plugins - there
are enough - you can start a _very_ effective attack!

-> update.php:85     $http_request .= 'User-Agent: WordPress/' .
$wp_version . '; ' . get_bloginfo('url') . "\r\n";

1. no need to even send the version to know there is a need to update 
(just get the latest version number and compare to the current version).

2. if wp send information about the blog, the users should be aware of 
this and be able to turn it off. this is a bad publicity bomb waiting to 
go off.

 From what I've read of the WP Cron code, you want to use 
wp_clear_scheduled_hook unless you want to remove all instances of the 
scheduled event. wp_unschedule_event is good if you screw up and 
constantly add the same event over and over again. It is better to use 
wp_unschedule_event, than iterating over wp_clear_scheduled_hook. At 
least in my opinion with the very little I've used of it.

I would agree that it would be useful to know that you have to create a 
hook before using some of the functions. The only way I was finally able 
to get my plugin to work was finding some awesome guy online that wrote 
about the troubles and journey he had with trying to schedule an event.

Your logic is flawed. You assume that someone looking to exploit won't
attack the latest version. This is usually untrue. If a serious exploit is
found, hackers usually just Google for "WordPress" (it's already on your
site for "powered by WordPress") or like wp-login.php and then attempt to
exploit it, regardless of version. If some database somewhere somehow did
get leaked, then all it'd do is just make the hackers job easier -- it
wouldn't enable them.

And by checking for an update, your server's IP address is sent
automatically. It wouldn't be hard to reverse lookup that IP.

Simply put, if you really insist on wearing a tin foil hat, it's uber easy
to disable the automatic update checker. For the other 99.99999% of people
out there, this feature will be a godsend to them in both terms of new
features and more importantly, the _only_ real way to make sure your site
doesn't get hacked -- by running the latest version.

Are there any plans to add this for themes? Tarski has had this for a
while, and I've always thought it was one of its more useful features.
Basically we have an Atom feed which is updated every time a new
version is released, and that's checked by the theme every time the
Tarski Options page or the Dashboard is accessed.

That's not true. Most blogs are on virtual hosting environments, where
many domains are assigned to one IP. And even if in fact you have only
one domain on your server, the party performing a reverse lookup will
not be able to tell that. Therefore it's a large difference whether you
log the client IP or you transmit the blog URL. And this is the very
reason why Automattic logs the Blog URL.

It's none of WP's business who runs a blog. I know some people don't
care about privacy, I however do, and I disapprove anybody trying to
gather more information than neccessary about me and what I do. Unless
anybody can give me a good explaination for why Wordpress/Automattic
needs to know my URLs.

By the way, I was rather shocked when I saw what big bunch of data
Akismet transmits on connecting to its server. Why the heck does Akismet
transmit *all* my $_SERVER environment variables? That's a big reason to
mistrust Akismet, unless there are *very* good reasons for that. And I
doubt there are any.

By the way, does Rule No. 1 of Automattic's privacy policy still apply?

"We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We
can?t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income
level for no apparent reason.)"

http://automattic.com/privacy/

Because, I also can't stand services that retrieve my $_SERVER variables
and my blog URL for no apparent reason.

That's why I'm referring to plugins. Opposed to Wordpress plugins have
fewer installations and often maintained by a single person. Fewer
installations makes them less interesting for attacks, because it is not
always easy to find them. But if you have a nice list, including the
version in use.... The problem with the single person is, that this
person is maintaining the plugin in his spare time. Opposed to Wordpress
it self where a lot of people, making money, are interested in Wordpress
being safe.

First of all you don't need a reverse lookup as you can just enter the
IP. Second if you do a reverse lookup you often only get something linke
serverxy.hoster.tld, because most people don't want to spend so much
money for a v-server or even a real server. Therefore the IP doesn't
help you that much. Of couse you can check all the Domains on that Host,
but you would also have to check for subdomains and or subdirectories.
Of course there are people where you can start an attack using the IP or
with the domain you get with a reverse lookup, but those are not the
installations I'm worried about. BTW: Being able to access a server by
IP number or the reverse DNS-entry is a security flaw in my eyes, but
that is another matter.
Or in short: The IP helps you, but not much.

I do not want to do that! And I never suggested that! (I hope you know
what a md5 is....)

But still that is no reason to tell everybody which version I'm running.
And sorry I'm not able to update my Software 24/7. This is no f*ck'n
pro/contra update checking discussion. It is a: Do you really need to
collect all this information? And do you know that collecting it is a
reasonable threat? Because if there is a security update and someone
does get that list he can run an attack on those hosts who haven't
updated yet.

We were discussing this on a political blogger mailing list I am on. There
are about 30 WP users on that list. As of this morning, 18 of them said they
will not be moving to WP 2.3 solely because of this. Like one of the
bloggers said; "If they are not telling you about this feature when you
upgrade, then when will they take other personal information like emails and
secretly send them to a server".

I know this is a small micro-sampling of WP users, but it has had me
thinking. While most of us on the mailing list know Matt and that he
wouldn't be out to do something like that, how about the other 99%+ WP users
out there who don't know him? In a time when internet privacy concerns are
in our daily newspapers, I believe a lot more consideration should be given
to this before rolling it out. IMHO the best option would be to include the
feature as a bundled plugin. That way people can opt into it. 

Personally, my biggest complaint is with the persistence of this
notification. I changed the version # just so I could see it. There really
needs to be a way to close this out. Having it show all the time is a nag. I
say make it so when someone closes it, it will come back every 24 hours or
so. It shouldn't be that bad to implement a way to close this out.

- Put a close link on the notification. Have it remove it either via ajax or
a get method (possibly read in admin.php). When it's closed you set an
option HideUpdateNotification_{$user->ID}. Set that with the
currenttime+time_to_hide_it. This is option is checked and if the option
time<currenttime, go ahead and show it again (then the person can close it
again if they so choose).

I wouldn't go so far to accuse WP/Automattic of *secretly* submitting
data. However, I dislike it when software tries to gather too much data,
and other people obviously agree. (Just imagine what would happen if,
say, MS IIS would send your server environment variables to a MS
server.) So I always look for ways to cut off this kind of behaviour.

Anyway, not upgrading is a bad idea, you know the reasons. You *could*
go back to 2.0.x, but not without much effort and potential issues.

As for Akismet, one can simply find the following section and comment it
out:

foreach ( $_SERVER as $key => $value )
	if ( !in_array( $key, $ignore ) )
		$comment["$key"] = $value;

Luckily, this modification doesn't affect Akismet's functioning, and if
it would (e.g. in a future version), it wouldn't be a problem faking
this data. As Akismet resides in wp-content/ the plugin isn't directly
affected by core upgrades either.

Sounds interesting. However, I have an idea for a hack to prevent the
submission of the blog URL in this specific case, and I think I'll
release it as a plugin in case it should become neccessary.

By the way, could you (Jamie) send me a link to your list, specifically
to the mentioned discussion, to my e-mail address? Thanks.

Kind regards,
Alex

To get some facts out added some debugging output.

Wordpress version and your url (which I already encapsulated in a md5).
IMHO a list of plugin names and a answer with the current version

Sounds good to me.

maybe we should only send plugin file, version and name.

also, in the spirit of my original proposal:

1. this should not be bundled with the new version check.

2. users should explicitly agree to send info before WP sends anything.

Omry, although I do agree with you, I'm not sure whether you understand
the situation. We are not discussing what we - in this case they, as I
am not a core-dev and I think neither are you - should do or what is the
best way to solve this problem. The code is there and tested. The
release is Monday, tomorrow. There will be _no_ changes is the way it
works. The only thing that might happen, is that the URL get's wrapped
in a md5 or better not transmitted at all.
Cheers
Morty

Ok, before you guys don't upgrade at all, here's a little plugin which
will completely(!) suppress the version checker.

------- SNIP -------
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: No Update Checker
Description: *Very* rough hack to suppress the WordPress update checker.
Version: 0.1
*/

function noupdatechecker()
{
   if ( !defined('WP_INSTALLING') )
      define('WP_INSTALLING', true);
}
add_action('init', 'noupdatechecker', 9);
?>
------- SNIP -------

Save the above as noupdatechecker.php (or whatever) in
wp-content/plugins/. No whitespace must be outside the PHP tags! Then
activate the plugin in the admin panel.

Note: The plugin deactivates the version checker by defining
WP_INSTALLING, a constant that is used in other parts of the core, too.
I had a quick grep, looked at the respective positions, and tested the
associated WP features -- the normal functioning of WordPress seems not
to be impacted by this hack. Anyway, if strange things happen due to its
usage, let me know. Feedback is apprechiated (e-mail me).


Kind regards,
Alex

You confused me a bit with the suggestion to add plugin information.

in this case, I agree that sending md5 of the url is a step in the right 
direction.


in all truth, I don't see why the client even NEED to send it's version. 
it can be nice for statistics purpose, but  nothing more..

it can just as easily be implemented by requesting the latest version 
number from the server and comparing it to the current version.

but as you said, it's probably already too late for this.


I think it's a shame that the concerns raised in this mailing list in 
past few weeks about this were ignored.

Cool, that's good to know. However, as far as I see, this won't stop
wp-includes/update.php from executing. That file contains a function
that is registered via the 'init' hook, and it is loaded on each page of
the admin panel.


Kind regards,
Alex

Alex, if you're looking at wp-includes/update.php then that function
is for the core update system (which can be disabled with my other
plugin http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-core-update/).

The plugin update system is handled in wp-admin/incluces/update.php
and is called on the load-plugins.php hook.

John.

Great! This is indeed much better than my solution -- I also should have
thought of remove_action(). Thumbs up! :-)

I understand, especially since the slugs are unreadable strings of 
%3e%42 etc. if you don't do something about them in Japanese, such as 
write them out in European alphabets. (You probably want to define 
custom slugs anyway, so your URLs are more readable.) I will also 
point out that you can see the list of tag names (rather than slugs) 
inside the Advanced Tag Entry section, where it lists them out as the 
blog reader will see them (e.g. in Japanese characters).

Just so you can understand why I made the decision to put slugs in the 
upper tag entry field:

If I put the tag names in the upper tag field, they would have to be 
"raw" rather than display-filtered tag names, which can get to be 
fairly long and cumbersome for multi-lingual bloggers. You might only 
be able to see one or two tags in the width of the field, which isn't 
all that useful or readable. The slugs, on the other hand, are 
normally short and readable. Multi-lingual bloggers were my primary 
reason for writing the plugin, for users (including myself) of 
Language Switcher, one of my other plugins.

Also I was concerned about special characters if raw names were put 
into the upper field, because ATE works through JavaScript/JQuery, 
which requires some encoding, and then WP does some encoding and 
editing upon save, and so on -- sometimes this could end up creating a 
new tag if you are not really careful about which special characters 
are encoded by which method in which spot. So I felt it was safer to 
put the slugs into the upper tag field (which have already been 
URL-encoded in the DB), and then let WP do all the tag saving for 
posts. Perhaps it was a bit of laziness on my part, since the plugin 
then doesn't have to worry about how to associate tags with posts, but 
putting slugs there ensures that WP finds the correct tags to 
associate. So at least it works correctly. :)

> I've made advtagentry-ja.mo, so may I send it to you?

Yes, translations are welcome -- I already have Chinese and Spanish. 
If anyone has further translations they'd like to contribute under the 
GPL, please send both PO and MO files (so that others can modify 
translations, they need PO; if they just want to use it unmodified, 
they need MO), and I'll put them into the release zip.

Send them directly to me rather than to the list, because I think the 
list strips attachments.

Cheers,
     Jennifer

I don't know, but I'm trying to find out.  It seems unnecessary to  
me.  And it definitely works without it (or with a different --  
anonymous -- string).  Matt wrote that code, so I'll try to get a  
hold of him today.

Your blog URL and version has been sent by default for 4+ years to every 
ping service in the world, including Ping-O-Matic, every time you make a 
post. Of course you can turn that off, just like you can turn update 
notification off, but statistically no one does.

The only new information being sent by the update checker is PHP version 
and a list of plugins. If you don't like that feature, please install a 
plugin to disable it:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-core-update/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-plugin-updates/

Of course don't forget the WP dev blog and planet RSS feeds, and most 
importantly the incoming links feed which ALSO transmits your blog URL.

I would also recommend disabling the updates in Mac OS X, Firefox, 
Windows, Thunderbird, Adobe Photoshop, and any other third-party 
applications you have. As all of those are tied to your personal IP and 
not your server IP they have far more implications for privacy.

Such an attack would not be more effective, it would just be more 
efficient. Historically, however, scripts that attack against WordPress 
don't bother checking the version or if a plugin is there or not, they 
just seek out every WP blog and check the specific capability or 
vulnerability.

Nevertheless, we're beefing up the infrastructure and security of 
WordPress.org, which Barry is working on right this instant. In 2 years 
of running WordPress.com and Akismet, two extraordinarily 
high-visibility targets, there has never been a problem on a server 
Barry set up. The only problems we've had (once on WP.org, once on 
PhotoMatt) have been things I set up, and I'm not setting up these new 
ones. :)

I think this feature is actually going to dramatically improve the 
security of WordPress overall. We all saw the survey that 95% of WP 
blogs were vulnerable. That didn't even look a plugins. I think the 
survey was flawed, but you still can't deny that for most people knowing 
there is an update and actually updating just doesn't happen, and this 
is a necessary first step. If the only "trade-off" is sending an ALREADY 
PUBLIC blog URL to wordpress.org, then great!

I would like to remind the participants of this thread that WP.org != 
Automattic, so to be fair to the members of both please distinguish 
which you're referring to.

I'm not sure - I think they will relay traffic on port 25, so long as it
originates from localhost and not a foreign IP. At least, that's the default
on the shared servers I've tested and the default setting on Windows Server
2003 (yeah, I know :P).

I think you didn't get my point. This is not about what I write, but
what information gets collected at one point and whether I can decide
about that. Of course I have an interest in spreading my word. And I
already said that it is no problem being listed on google. It's the
combination of Plugins + Versions + Url.

Well it will also be more effective, because less people will notice.
And yes you are right it will be more efficient, something that is
probably worth a bit of money.

NSA, CIA, FBI, NASA, all thought their systems are safe. And if there is
nothing to loose there is nothing to bother. And as I said. I have no
problem with collecting data, but with being able to relate them.

Once again. It's not about the blog-URL, its about the relationship
BlogURL & plugins & their versions. Blogurl | plugins & their versions
is no problem with me.

So, this is a bit confusing...

- Ping-O-Matic is receiving my "version"?  Huh?

- Automattic's not getting this data in pre-2.3 versions, correct?  If that's the case, then the (obvious) problem with that is that somebody decided to flip this switch without making it opt-in.

This WordPress feature *requires* Automattic?

Back up a minute.  Why is the blog URL needed?  The update  
notification functionality works fine without it.  You don't need it  
for statistics purposes -- wp_hash('update-notification') 's output  
would be just as unique.  How do users benefit by sending their blog  
URL?  I think the onus is on us to show why it is necessary or  
beneficial.  If we can't, it shouldn't be there.

Not yet, but I think it's a good idea. Unfortunately theme data is much 
less structured than plugins.

Thanks, Mark -- I think that is the correct question.

And the same question should be asked about the other data that is
sent.  Why are the plugin versions sent to the server?  It should be
enough to send the plugin filename and/or name, so the server can
return a list of current versions.  The client (WP) can then figure
out which plugins need updating.

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

The system was designed to keep the client side as light as possible so 
the heavy lifting can be done on the server side, allowing us a lot more 
flexibility and agility in adapting the service as it gets rolled out 
and evolves.

For example right now nothing is done with regards to localization, but 
because of the data being sent and the lightness of the client side we 
could introduce that feature in the future without having to update 
every install of WordPress in the world. This philosophy has worked very 
well for Akismet over the past 2 years. I believe it is also the best 
approach for WordPress.

Today the server does basically nothing, no logging, no analysis, no 
stats, it's just designed to be as fast as possible since I don't know 
what type of impact 2.3 is going to have on api.wordpress.org. In the 
future, however, I think there is a lot of room to grow it, particularly 
once we take updates to the next step and allow people to 
upgrade/install things with one click from their dashboard.

This takes me back to when I was teaching. I can't tell you the countless students that would say "well X does it so why can't I"? 

Now consider these applications you mentioned. Every one of them also has EULA's, privacy statements, etc. Take Windows as an example. Once you complete an install you are presented with the "Stay up to date" option. Also when you install these applications you do agree to the terms laid out within said agreements (think of that little checkbox you must check to install it). Now I concede that a majority of people do not take the time to read what they are agreeing to, but it is there none the less. Having said that, using these applications as an example is nothing more than creating a straw man on the issue.

Now the complaint I am hearing involves the transparency of this feature. When users upgrade, or even install fresh, they are not told anywhere that this information is being sent, let alone any mention or promise that it won't be used for some malicious purpose. That is why I strongly feel an option to opt in/out should be given on the upgrade/install screens. 

I want to reaffirm that I know this information will *not* be used for malicious purposes. I actually think it is a good idea. Think of how the stats involving PHP versions versus overall installations would have aided in the PHP4/PHP5 debate.

If you don't trust wordpress.org, I suggest you do one of the following:

1. Use different software.
2. Fork WordPress.
3. Install one of the aforementioned plugins.

Wordpress is a great software. No reason to do so.

This would be quite stupid. I don't have the time to do so. And I not
going to that because of one or two lines of code. I as a coder can
easily change those. And this is not what this discussion is about.

Not an option. The update-notification is one of the reasons to switch
to 2.3

some heavy lifting, comparing versions.
with Akismet the server actually provide a dynamic service to the 
client, here all it needs to do is to tell it the latest version.
it can be as simple as storing a static file on the server.

Localization of what?


I feel like I am wasting my time trying to convince you, but here are my 
arguments anyway:
1. you have stated yourself that you don't need the url.
2. the url breaks the anonymity of the request, and many people will not 
like it at all. most will only find about it once it blows up - and by 
then they will feel installing a plugin to prevent it is like closing 
the stable after the horses ran away.
3. it will blow up because bloggers are one most privacy aware 
populations, and I give it less than a week from the official release 
date. also expect a "Wordpress is spying on users" article on Slashdot 
(This is not a threat, just an attempt to predict the near future).
4. you can't compare this to sending blog url (and version, why?!) to 
technorati because people opt-in to send that information, and it's 
required to provide them with the service they are receiving.
5. you can't compare it closed source programs with high opacity, that 
may or may not send system information regularly. the reasons are that 
people does not know what they send (binary/encrypted protocols, no 
source) and that the companies cover their asses with the EULA. (so in a 
way the users agree).

    Omry.

What if someone knows your blog URL can they hack your blog?

No.

What if someone hacks ping-o-matic or weblogs.com and gets all the blog 
URLs in the world, can they hack your blog?

No.

What if someone simply subscribes to the list of updated blogs on 
weblogs.com, can they hack your blog?

No.

What if someone blindly checks for filenames in your wp-content/plugins 
directory to see what plugins you're using, can they hack your blog?

No.

What if someone hacks wordpress.org and gets a list of blog URLs and the 
plugins they use, can they hack your blog?

No.

What if wordpress.org also stored what version of a plugin you were 
using, which there are no plans to do, AND the hacker broke in and stole 
that, can they hack your blog?

No.

What if you're running an insecure version of a plugin or WordPress, can 
someone hack your blog?

Yes. And they can (and do) do it without any of the above.

Please reread that.

Will the update notification feature shipping tomorrow in WordPress 2.3 
mean fewer people are running insecure versions of WordPress and plugins?

Yes.

Just like there is premature optimization we could argue about for days, 
I think there is also premature paranoia. What's in trunk is what is 
shipping with WordPress tomorrow. I don't think your concerns are valid 
in the real world, and even if you assume a malicious wordpress.org the 
security and privacy of WordPress users will be no different tomorrow 
than it is today. It's optimized for a reasonable person, but with hooks 
and filters for those with niche concerns.

Subject: [wp-hackers] api.wordpress only returns some version updates
Message-ID: <1190598318.m2f.39083@www.galleryembedded.com>

Greetings,

I been doing some testing of the update checking for plugins and found it is returning new version information for some plugins but failing to return new version info for others..

Taking for example my plugin, WPG2 which went 3.0RC Final, I simulate a version update check by resetting the version on my development blog to 2.0 and check the headers to ensure the plugin info is being sent as 2.0 to api.wordpress.org yet api fails to return a new version notification.

What is wierd is the check is working for some plugins (wp-cache) yet not my plugin, also taking to other authors, it appears others are also having the same issue (in-series) for example with the version checker on api.wordpress.org

Anyone else having the same issues, it appears api.wordpress.org seems to have some concerns with version checking??

Pardon me for asking something which might already have an answer on
the Web (I read this before), but do you know the figure that
corresponds to #/% of WordPress blogs that run the very latest (as of
today), i.e. least insecure version of WordPress?

It's an honest question, by the way; no provocation intended at all,
but one has to be realistic. Patching it about liability more than
practicality, IMHO.

If you're having any issues just email me the plugin that caused the 
problem so I can test, and of course what you expected it to map to in 
the plugins directory.

It turns out there are a lot file changes (13 I believe) but most of them
are either minimal routine changes (like adding the new javascript to
script-loader, new permission to order pages) or are for added files that
will never need to be changed/messed with by the WP folks (eg.: external
plugin files).

The only substantial parts of code that belong to WordPress are at *
wp-admin/js/edit-page-order.js  (new)**,
**wp-includes/class-page-order.php(new)
**, **wp-admin/admin-ajax.php (altered) *and if you add them up there are
probably less than 300 LOC, which is also pretty independent from everything
else in WP and very unlikely to break anything else.

Thanks for the nice comments, Cheers,

Bernardo

How are your responses constructively debating the issue at hand? Nothing
personal, but IMO this is the wrong kind of approach from your position. So
if an individual using the open source software (which theoretically anyone
can contribute to) is questioning what a feature of the software is worth,
you tell them to put up and shut up, or leave altogether?

I may regret sending this email, but this response just stoked a reaction
from me.

It's mainly about the reasons why Automattic/WordPress need your blog's URL
in order to check updates, but in truth they don't need it at all, at least
that's my take on the discussion that's taken place.

That's not really an argument /for/ it.

It's a behind the scenes feature, so simplicity and ease don't really  
apply.  Self-evident?  Evident to whom?  Evident for what purpose?

Having a unique token is certainly nice, because it allows you to  
identify unique WP installs and track percentages of people running  
outdated versions or core or plugins.  That sort of data can help  
guide the project.  For instance, if we want to change something that  
will break a few plugins, we can see how many people are using those  
plugins, and get an idea of the impact.  That can be done with an  
anonymous token.

But it's not a necessary trade-off.  The update functionality works  
just as well with an anonymous token.

I'm not about to douse myself with gasoline here, but it does seem  
like we could address the privacy concerns (edge/paranoid though they  
may seem) without affecting the functionality in a negative way and  
without affecting WP.org's future ability to track WP/plugin version  
statistics.  If you have some killer feature that could be enabled on

I was just looking at Drupal status update module, and they do this very
thing. They create a site key that is sent:

$site_key = md5($base_url . $drupal_private_key);

That does offer a nice way to distinguish unique installs. 

I also looked into PHPBB's core update checked. That just downloads a text
file:

http://www.phpbb.com/updatecheck/30x.txt

So that means no version checking or anything. 

I was curious and decided to look at some other methods out there :)

Message-ID: <20070924044926.GB1670@gerf.org>

Okay.  Let's take a look at the situation.

I'm going to recap, please point out errors.

SITUATION:
Currently, 2.3 sends the bloginfo('home'), the plugin name, and the
plugin version # to api.wordpress.blah

The only thing currently being used by api.wordpress.blah is plugin
name and possibly the version number (but just for a simple string
check?).

However, having the server doing a version number check is actually
powerful because the plugins have version numbers all over the place
and api.wordpress.blah could actually track the chronological order to
figure out what's newer than what.

The URL currently servers no purpose.  It could possibly do something
in the future, but I'm not clear what.

IMPACT:
The ACTUAL ability for a cracker to break into your blog is not
increased at all by collecting this information, assuming it was
somehow made available to malicious people.

However, the ability for a hacker to get a nice list of people who
haven't upgraded to the latest security fixed plugin foo is increased
by this.  Which makes api.wordpress.blah a seductive target.

There is also the perceived security risk, which is unrelated to the
actual security risk.  As we can see just from the very limited
audience on this mailing list, the perception is that there is an
increased risk for blog owners.

There is a reputation or privacy risk as well.  The plugins
that a blog runs may or may not be detectable externally.  However, it
is the blog owner's choice to advertise what plugins they have.

Finally, there is perception of a privacy invasion.  Again, from just
this limited audience we can see that there are privacy concerns.

SUGGESTIONS:
I would suggest that this feature be off initially.  It can be turned
on by the admin if they wish.  It should not send a URL, though I
think generating and storing some sort of UUID, and using that instead
of the blog URL is probably the best compromise.

CLOSING NOTES:
I want to point out that there has been a thread about a collecting
wordpress statistics. It overlaps a lot of the concerns for this
feature.  It was never proposed that this feature would be anything
other than opt-in.

Ciao!

URLs are useful unique identifiers and in my opinion the best one to use 
on the web. You can normalize them, organize them by domains and 
subdomains, look for odd characters or paths, create stats by TLDs, map 
them to hosting providers, use them as a basis for a crawl, and 
associate them with WordPress.org profiles. MD5s are unique, but don't 
have a lot of value beyond that, and even a capitalization or trailing 
slash change will change the whole MD5. There are also things I think we 
haven't imagined yet that could make URLs useful. Maybe a .org toolbar 
that ties into your .org profile and makes it easy to manage multiple 
blogs and tie them together. If by the time 2.5 comes around we're still 
not doing anything useful with it then we can re-examine it.

I don't think an MD5 would be significantly more anonymous either. 
Anyone with a list of URLs could associate the md5 with a URL just by 
pre-computing the URL MD5s and comparing. So they would be different, 
but not really better. You'd have to add a salt of some kind. We're 
hours from the release arguing about a bikeshed that was checked in over 
a month ago.

I'm not trying to suck up or anything, but I have to agree with Matt on this
one. I still have yet to a valid security related issue with transmitting
the install URL when checking for updates. Not to mention all of this is
going on the assumption that Joe Blow has an Office Depot "Easy Button" for
hacking into the WP.org server and even then, as Matt said, nothing is being
stored.

The paranoid factor however is valid, as shown by this long discussion. It
seems just too many people are wearing tin foil hats these days and getting
worked up over what in my opinion is nothing. "The Man" is not out to get
you, people.

Simply put, I think we should do what is best for the majority. For the
minority, plugins will work nicely.

it doubleposts ]

wp_hash() uses an unchanging salt (set once in the database and not  
updated by WordPress ever).  So wp_hash('update-check') will remain  
constant for the life of the blog.  The uses of a URL identifier you  
mention are interesting -- though none seem "killer," and some of  
those uses should probably be "opt-in."

I can see both sides of the fence here and I agree with Matt is be nice to have a set of statistics but I feel fundamentally we need to give the blogger the ability to opt in on sending statistics rather than just blindly sending those statistics regardless of how benign they are.. 

We all know the history of other applications that have sent statistics silently back without allowing opt in (or out).. and the backlash those other applications had to face, lets not go down this road..

I think an opt-in method would be a very bad idea. It'd nearly negate the
whole purpose of the feature as the majority of noob users would never turn
it on.

However, I full heartedly support an opt-out feature as well maybe a notice
the first time checking. Simply put, the default should be to check, but it
should be easy (easier than a plugin) to disable it.

This is exactly why I said in the "automatic user feedback" thread that
we should not tie version check with statistical gathering.

those are to different functions, with different importance and
characteristics.

version check should be turned on by default, statistics gathering
should be opt-in.

the fact that they somewhat overlap and that it's tempting to merge them
does not mean it's a good idea to do so.

Let me refine what I said:

I think version check shouldn't be able to be turned off without a plugin.
It's just too important that a user keeps up to date. But for those fringe
cases, plugins handle it nicely.

As for the statistics, I think it should be opt-out not opt-in. I think the
_vast_ majority of users, including me, realize there's no harm in sending
along WP details and/or more likely, just don't care (all the noob users out
there). For those who do care for some reason, valid or not, a simple check
box would do the trick and avoid any negative... press (right word?) on the
matter.

We definitely don't want to make this seem secretive IMHO.

It's about security and as much obscurity as possible. Of course you
should have an up to date system. But if you don't there is no need to
tell anyone. That's why I'm not in favor of installing the plugins that
deactivate the plugins.

This functionality, and the way to disable it, should be mentioned in
the official 2.3 release information in 40pt. bolded, underlined,
italicized text, as even the APPEARANCE of untoward behavior should be
avoided.  Doing sneaky stuff behind the scenes that has more face
value for the software provider and not for the software user has
already happened once in the history of WordPress and it's not a
specter I think anyone wants to conjure up again any time soon.

Full disclosure is the way to go, plus a link in slightly smaller text
pointing end users to Ideas and Kvetches so we can track end users'
reactions to this feature.

It would be terrible if this went "undisclosed" and then "leaked" to
sites that already have an anti-WP stance who could very well scare
users off of upgrading or even using WP in the first place.

At least that's how I see it.

Hello there

I'm trying to run a WP blog on a lighty server. Everything is fine and 
fast, except for the pretty permalinks which can be no better than 
/index.php?/2007/01/hello-world/

I searched here and there, but the only workaround I was able to find is 
the "define your 50+ redirect array" trick [1] which doesn't seem really 
convenient if you have to edit it every time you post a page. Nothing on 
the Codex was helpful, except for using lighty as an offload server for 
static content.

I have the disappointing feeling that lighty cannot handle the "if file 
does not exist, then rewrite to index.php" rule as in WP now, so I'm 
curious to hear about people who are succesfully running it. Any 
experience with lighttpd to share ?

I think I agree with matt here.  The main point is this is a bikeshed issue.

>From personal experience running the webservice for my version-check

the blog url with every request.

For me the main points are:

 1. Sending the url doesn't expose any private information.
 2. We have been sending our urls out as pings for years without any issue.
 3. Sending the url may allow Wordpress.org to do analysis of the user
base in the future - we should probably state this if and when it
happens.

In my view the best thing that could be done now is to document the API on
the front page of api.wordpress.org and point there from the release
notes.

Indeed it doesn't. It supports the equivalent of "RewriteRule", but
absolutely no equivalent of "RewriteCond", which I feel is essential to
any sort of useful rewriting implementation.

I did get it going without those 50+ rewrite rules by setting WordPress'
index.php as the 404 handler. However, any 404 on your website, even if
it is outside of WordPress, will be handled by WordPress. Also, you are
restricted to running only one permalink-enabled copy of WordPress at a
time.

So, the permalink situation on lighty sucks, frankly.

I don't think discussion of an optional plugin is exactly apposite to
the discussion of a mandatory feature in the core product.

As the stories surrounding Yahoo!, Google, Microsoft, et al. and their
[mis]use of customers' information shows, average information
consumers are becoming increasingly worried about and sensitive to
issues pertaining to their privacy, regardless of the actual impact or
severity of the information exposed.

This isn't a bikeshed issue, in my opinion, due to the fact that when
it comes to the marketplace of ideas, perception IS reality.  If
TechCrunch, Engadget, Slashdot, Kuro5hin, Linux Today, Ars Technica,
etc. get wind that WordPress is "phoning home" and not notifying users
that it is doing so (with some explanation as to the full
ramifications), well, I think Six Apart's recent issues with Open
Sourcing MT 4 are going to look like a tempest in a teapot.  Your
reputation is something that is extremely difficult to build up,
fairly difficult to maintain and EXTREMELY easy to lose very quickly.

To developers, the potential benefits to having each WP install send
this info back are fairly evident.  To average users, frightened by
CNN Headline News' unending litany of identity theft reports, the
benefits are not so plain.

I'm not advocating that we strip it out at the last moment.  I'm
advocating for full, up-front and transparent disclosure, including,
but not limited to, the Dev Blog announcement, the release notes and
any external communications that get sent out to whomever cares to
receive information on the latest WordPress releases.

What makes this issue so big is the "secrecy" involving what it is doing.
Adding a simple warning, or even an opt-in/out method would entail minimal
coding. The resistance against that leaves some with a feeling that "well
maybe they are going to do something with this list of URLs". There is no
statement of privacy or anything. How is average Joe to be assured that WP
isn't going to sell this collection of URLs to spam services? Every other
mainstream service/application that collects any information makes sure the
end user knows about this and has a privacy statement to go along with the
service.

A golden rule of any product/service is that you *never* assume on behalf of
the consumer/end-user. Transparency is the key to trust. Also the strong
resistance to this transparency, given by Matt (who is more or less the
voice of WP), is actually making a stronger argument for this transparency.
When Matt said if you don't like it then "use another product, start a
fork", it really gave a sense that he has something personally to
profit/gain from this feature.

Now for a question.

I haven't looked into the code enough yet, but how effective will this
plugin to remove it be? You can't install the plugin until after you install
the product. By that time hasn't a check already been done, or does a wait a
predetermined amount of time after an install/upgrade to check for updates?

Not to reply to myself, but, well...

We already have a subpage under Options called "Privacy" dedicated to
a single radiobutton option.  In 2.3.1 or 2.4, we ought to add "Send
my blog information back to the WordPress mothership.  This will help
WordPress developers make WordPress better, faster, safer and more
secure."

Then, the bikeshed can be red OR blue, depending on how Neo-ish you're
feeling that particular day.

I would suggest that you get a basic understanding of what you are talking
about BEFORE you deride people's security concerns. Even Microsoft has made
Auto update both Opt-IN, and non-server side. They even tell you where on
your computer update info is stored so you can wipe it off if you want/need
to.

Anything which is "automatic" needs to spell out exactly what it is doing,
and if you are storing MY data on your server, then you have the
responsibility to disclose what you are doing to safeguard that data. You
aren't even encrypting the data transmission from my WP install to your
server, why should I believe you are doing anything to safe guard it once it
is on the server.

Go do some research on PII (Personal Identifying Information). The IRS has a
good primer on it:
http://www.irs.gov/irm/part1/ch08s05.html

Your home address and phone numbers are PII, even though they are publicly
available. The same is true of my blog URL and plugin information.

This really is the type of thing you have to make as public as possible
before hand. This should have been discussed by the entire WP community (we
are a community right? This isn't just your personal play toy right?) before
line one of code was written.

As Matt mentioned a few emails ago, this was brought up as an issue the day
before the release. You know why? Because once again WP has not involved the
community directly.

Also, remember that SENDING the data is only a small part of the issue here.
The real issue is the storing of the data. Obvious security issues aside
(the second you store my information, it IS a security issue, whether you
believe the data is valuable or not), the simple fact that you can then use
that information for any purpose you want (since there is no TOS/EULA
associated with it) at any point in the future is a problem.

This conversation is pretty moot at this point. For 2.3 anyway. Ya'll can probably cool your heels. Like it or not, today is 2.3 launch date and everything has been pretty much frozen for weeks as its all been about bug fixing. I'd highly doubt that even if you convinced Matt, that _anything_ would or could be done for 2.3. So... Save your arguments and energy for 2.4.

Subject: RE: [wp-hackers] Plugin update & security / privacy


What makes this issue so big is the "secrecy" involving what it is doing.
Adding a simple warning, or even an opt-in/out method would entail minimal
coding. The resistance against that leaves some with a feeling that "well
maybe they are going to do something with this list of URLs". There is no
statement of privacy or anything. How is average Joe to be assured that WP
isn't going to sell this collection of URLs to spam services? Every other
mainstream service/application that collects any information makes sure the
end user knows about this and has a privacy statement to go along with the
service.

A golden rule of any product/service is that you *never* assume on behalf of
the consumer/end-user. Transparency is the key to trust. Also the strong
resistance to this transparency, given by Matt (who is more or less the
voice of WP), is actually making a stronger argument for this transparency.
When Matt said if you don't like it then "use another product, start a
fork", it really gave a sense that he has something personally to
profit/gain from this feature.

Now for a question.

I haven't looked into the code enough yet, but how effective will this
plugin to remove it be? You can't install the plugin until after you install
the product. By that time hasn't a check already been done, or does a wait a
predetermined amount of time after an install/upgrade to check for updates?

For changes, yes, for end-user notification, no.

See: recent uproar over Microsoft updating Windows Update on machines
with autoupdated turned off for consumer reaction to third party

A 'test drive' installation (like OpenSourceCMS) would probably be
ideal. Resource intensive, prone to spamming, and potentially insecure
as well, so there are possible pitfalls... it's surprising that no
many plugin author  enable visitors to try that sort of stuff.

So that is also saying that if a security issue came up (hypothetical - your
database login information was obtainable), we would release 2.3 with it?
I'm sorry but security and privacy go hand in hand.

Since this is apparently going out as-is, my fix for clients that want the
update feature, but not their URL being sent is simple. I will be changing
it to send a different URL (perhaps photomatt.net - I mean since it doesn't
really matter).

I fail to see what such an announcement would help at such a late point
in time.  Would there be a way for the end-user to retroactively have
their data removed, before it was used for such analysis?  How would the
user know the data has actually been removed?  Wouldn't it be stored on
backups etc.?

>From the developers point of view, I, too, can understand the desire to
gather all kinds of data for statistical analysis and other purposes.
However, as an end-user I'm not at all fond of the gathering of data
about me, especially without my knowledge or permission.

When the data has no obvious and solid need for being transmitted,
it feels even worse.  As was pointed out in this thread, many other
update checkers do not send the software inventory and versions to the
Microsoft servers.  It seems the only real reason for WordPress to do so
is to collect more information about the end-users.

The privacy-aware approach would be to send the minimum amount of
information necessary to perform the function at hand.  The API is
already versioned, so if more information is needed in the future, it is
possible to do it in a manner that doesn't break old clients.

The update notification is such an important function that I'll still
be using it.  I might not feel good about the information sent, but I'd
still use the service.  I'm also waiting for my plugins to be approved
into the wp.org repository as that is the only way to provide update
notifications to their users.  When there is no real choice ("use it or
lose it" is not a real choice), you'll find yourself putting up with
quite a lot.

Best regards,

Apologies for reopening my old thread but how could I do a similar thing
with the admin pages?

I'd like to be able to provide a link on my plugin's management page to
export the data held in a custom table to a CSV file. I've tried the
admin-head action but that's not called early enough to generate a plain
text page.

Thanks,

No, you got the two functions confused.

wp_unschedule_event removes one event from the schedule. Whether that
event is recurring or not, it will remove it. If it is recurring, it
will not be recurring any more.

wp_clear_scheduled_hook actually iterates through wp_unschedule_event.
Given a hook and args, it will unschedule everything that matches
those.

So, wp_clear_scheduled_hook is what to use if you accidentally
schedule something a whole lot of times.

Read through wp-includes/cron.php. It's pretty straightforward for most of it.

A quick search of the code reveals that I'm after the equivalent of the
get_header action for the admin pages but I can't seem to find such a
thing. I think I can work around that with some redirection.

Thanks,

I think your best bet is to just put a link on your management page 
directly to your plugin PHP file (or a secondary file in your plugin 
distribution, e.g. a link to 
(blogurl)/wp-content/plugins/myplugin_csv.php). That would bypass all 
the admin header stuff. Of course, don't assume that any WordPress 
files have been loaded! I don't think you can do what you want via the 
standard admin menus.

In the interests of clarity, let's state exactly what's going on.

First case:
Every 43200 seconds (12 hours) or so, depending on when your site is
hit, the function will send a single HTTP request to
http://api.wordpress.org. It sends the following information:

WordPress Version
PHP Version
Locale setting (if there is one)
The Blog's URL

That's the main WordPress version check. It doesn't have anything to
do with plugins. Disabling it is easy, one line of code will do it:
remove_action('init','wp_version_check');


Second case:
Plugin update check. This occurs when you go to the plugin page and it
has not checked for updates in more than 43200 seconds (12 hours). It
also sends a single request to http://api.wordpress.org (different
script though) consisting of:
The Blog's URL
WordPress Version
Plugin names, url's, versions, etc. All the plugin info, basically,
including inactive plugins.

Disabling this is also easy, another one-liner:
remove_action( 'load-plugins.php', 'wp_update_plugins' );


WordPress and Automattic's privacy policies can be found here:
http://automattic.com/privacy/


Two things I have to say:
1. If the blog is set to "Private", on the privacy admin page, both of
these should be disabled. Why? Because the user will have expressed a
preference. Respect it.
2. There should be a link to the above privacy policy in the admin
pages, somewhere.

Given that WordPress has failed to do both of these, then yes, I agree
that this "feature" is subversive and will cause an outcry. Regardless
of *what* the information can be used (or not used) for, it's sending
out information without informing the user of that fact or disclaiming
what that information can and will be used to do. Furthermore, it has
no opt-out mechanism, especially when there exists a mechanism already
that allows the user to express such a preference.

These two simple things are really not optional. They must be added.
If you're collecting data, ever, then these are the absolute minimum.

So, there's my 2 cents.

One problem with that:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014856.html

Matt said:

"I would like to remind the participants of this thread that WP.org != 
Automattic, so to be fair to the members of both please distinguish 
which you're referring to."

So that privacy policy does not apply to Wordpress.org

Lol.... 

I think that's what happened with Vista, everything was marked off for SP1! 

Except I have some of the developers' words that not a single bug was left
"unresolved" before they sent it off. (now what constitutes "resolved" is
another matter)

Is that what we're trying to do here?

Subject: RE: [wp-hackers] Plugin update & security / privacy

What makes this issue so big is the "secrecy" involving what it is doing.
Adding a simple warning, or even an opt-in/out method would entail minimal
coding. The resistance against that leaves some with a feeling that "well
maybe they are going to do something with this list of URLs". There is no
statement of privacy or anything. How is average Joe to be assured that WP
isn't going to sell this collection of URLs to spam services? Every other
mainstream service/application that collects any information makes sure the
end user knows about this and has a privacy statement to go along with the
service.

A golden rule of any product/service is that you *never* assume on behalf of
the consumer/end-user. Transparency is the key to trust. Also the strong
resistance to this transparency, given by Matt (who is more or less the
voice of WP), is actually making a stronger argument for this transparency.
When Matt said if you don't like it then "use another product, start a
fork", it really gave a sense that he has something personally to
profit/gain from this feature.

Now for a question.

I haven't looked into the code enough yet, but how effective will this
plugin to remove it be? You can't install the plugin until after you install
the product. By that time hasn't a check already been done, or does a wait a
predetermined amount of time after an install/upgrade to check for updates?

Personally I don't care that much but isn't this actually illegal in  
some countries? I'm pretty sure it is here in Europe...

Don't have any idea about legality. But unless the wordpress.org devs
are in europe, I don't think it makes any difference.

Anyway, one thing that does bug me is the non optimized state of the
plugin checker. I mean, look at all the crap it sends:

data:object(stdClass)(2) {
 ["plugins"]=>
 array(15) {
   ["akismet/akismet.php"]=>
   array(5) {
     ["Name"]=>
     string(7) "Akismet"
     ["Title"]=>
     string(71) "<a href="http://akismet.com/" title="Visit plugin
homepage">Akismet</a>"
     ["Description"]=>
     string(354) "Akismet checks your comments against the Akismet web
service to see if they look like spam or not. You need a <a
href="http://wordpress.com/api-keys/">WordPress.com API key</a> to use
it. You can review the spam it catches under &#8220;Comments.&#8221;
To show off your Akismet stats just put <code>&lt;?php
akismet_counter(); ?></code> in your template."
     ["Author"]=>
     string(80) "<a href="http://photomatt.net/" title="Visit author
homepage">Matt Mullenweg</a>"
     ["Version"]=>
     string(5) "2.0.2"
   }


Why on earth would the description ever be needed? The Author and
version and such I can understand.

The reason it's doing this is because it's simply sending everything
returned by get_plugins(), which is understandable for a first draft,
but this really should have been cleaned up before release. For my
site, it'll be sending a 30k or more of data, needlessly.

Well, until I hack it not to do that, of course. Still, it's fairly
ridiculous to roll with this without fixing up the obvious silly bits.

Who cares about 30k every 12 h if your average page load is 100K?
IMHO stuff like this isn't that important.

Actually the WP devs DO need to worry about it and it does make a  
difference. It matters not where the code originated they could still  
find themselves on the receiving end of a legal case IF it is illegal  
and someone decides to make an issue out of it. They should at least  
consult someone with knowledge in the field. Cases like this can get  
very messy and generate lots of bad publicity. I'd be surprised it  
it's legal in the USA.

The GPL covers this. You should sometimes read the license for the code 
you use:

                NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Applicable by law being the key phrase there. If I create a program that
sends me back your bank information I can still be prosecuted for it because
it is against the law - GPL license or not.

I asked an attorney who I do work for about this. She sent me this link. It
is somewhat outdated, but does have some really good information regarding
this (and similar) issues:

Can someone please do something about the wp-trac spam? Someone has  
obviously exploited the username/password protection. My poor  
Blackberry is sweating at the moment. ;)

Thanks

OOPS and don't mean to respond to myself, but she just sent me another
email.

http://www.llrx.com/features/opensource.htm

Number 10 is of particular interest:

10. Treat Open Source Policy as a Team Game. It has become very clear in the
last few years that IT policy should not be made in a vacuum. Consider the
privacy example. Companies that left privacy policies to the IT department
or the legal department quickly found that "standard language" had enormous
implications for the marketing department, executives, sales staffs and
others. Nothing turned out to be simple or standard until all constituents
got involved and worked through the ramifications. Similarly, Open Source
usage, especially if development projects are contemplated, creates a wide
range of legal and business issues that should not be handled in isolation.
Theory has to meet practice to get the best results. If the lawyer only
looks at the legal issues and the CIO looks only at the IT issues, you
increase the likelihood of finger-pointing when an unexpected, but quite
predictable, bad result occurs. No one, especially me, likes the idea of yet
another committee meeting, but Open Source is a good example where time and
effort spent on the front-end will pay off substantially over the
alternative of cleaning up potentially messy and expensive situations in
which you may one day find yourself.

You aren't enough of a crackberry addict then, because you haven't

First of all, I personally don't have any issues with the current
implementation, but the legal discussion is another issue.

The license quoted says: UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW

Here in the Netherlands we have the "Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens" 
which translates to "Law for the protection of personal details". *1

It states:
- If personal information is stored it must be opt-in.
- You have to publicly inform what you intend to use the data for.
- ...

And your blog URL would be considered a personal detail according to that
law.

IANAL, but my feeling is that the current implementation would be illegal
here in The Netherlands.

Where in the GPL? I don't see it?
It says nothing about data harvesting without consent.
Anyway - this is my last input on this. I was simply trying to be  
helpful. I can imagine someone here in Europe having a field day in  
the courts and press with this one should they so wish.

The account was immediately blocked, but it seems the integration once

IANAL, but I assure you, it's legal here.

For that matter, it's most likely legal there too. It's not personal
information in any meaningful sense of the term. It's publicly
available information, anybody looking at your blog can see it in
their address bar.

You might have a case with "the plugins you're running", but not with
the blog URI.

I agree there, I for one don't think that would be illegal under  
Dutch law, and I've had to work with that law quite often...

This has taken an interesting turn. There is not just a legal question, but
also an ethical one. 

I would much rather bet on the fact that no one here can say with absolute
certainty that sending the URL is or isn't legal, than staking a position of
saying it is or isn't. Think Microsoft. They have tons of attorneys that sit
there and think "well this is legal", and we know how that has ended up for
them in numerous anti-trust cases. Assuming certainty in the law is asking
for trouble.

There is an ethical side to this. Most people won't know this is sending the
URL. If they happen to find out down the road, then they are going to wonder
what else is being sent (should average Joe user have to learn PHP and dig
through source code to figure this out?). In 30+ years of software
development, I have always practiced full disclosure. Every company I have
worked for also engages the same policy where user identifying data
collection is involved. 

Now being self employed and having 11 clients that I take care of Wordpress
installation for (and at the advice of my attorney), I have sent out emails
alerting them of this collection of information. Not saying that it will
turn into a legal battle down the road, but it is better to err on the side
of caution (Three already have said they don't care. Four have said they
don't want to upgrade - including two that have asked me about other
platforms. Still waiting to hear from the other four, but I won't upgrade
them until I hear from them).

Having said that, I still strongly believe this information must be
disclosed in installs/upgrades. Does anyone seriously believe that a person
will stop installing Wordpress (after creating a DB, uploading files, etc)
just because they have to check a box saying "I agree to allow Wordpress.org
to collect statistics about my installation" (In better verbiage of course)?
If that is the case, then Wordpress is seriously hurting in the
user-friendly aspect.

Enough said.

Does anyone here seriously believe Microsoft gives a damn about *you* personally and personally identifying info?
If Microsoft were to start silently and without warning begin recording even NECESSARY info and sending it at regular intervals to Redmond, do you think they would use that info to personally identify anyone or let that data be leaked anywhere? The obvious answer is no f*****ing way.

But if Microsoft were to start doing such a thing, there would no end to the litigation, lawsuits, and complaints. Businesses WOULD stop using it, in the blink of an eye if they feel they've really been violated. And governments - do you think the CIA would appreciate the fact that their OS of choice is "spying" on them? Imagine the litigation and class-action lawsuits to follow... 

So why is it ANY different for WordPress? Being open source isn't a "Get out of jail free" card, is it?

The latest versions of Windows and Office have a "consumer improvement" program that sends periodic data to MS, *WITH* a guarantee that no personally identifying info will be sent, AND a button you can press to see ALL info being transmitted. What's more, it's OFF by default (as in opt-in). And of course, they have one hell of a privacy policy.

Sure, I love and respect WP and the team. I know you guys won't misuse this info, and so do many people out there too. I always opt-in to these programs, because a developer I know the importance of statistics. But the fact of the matter is, it's stupid, reckless, and just plain un-thought-through to secretly send data back to WP/Automattic/whatever-the-hell-it-is, *ESPECIALLY* without even an opt-OUT button and most definitely without a privacy policy. I've got to say, what the hell were you guys thinking?

This is the INFORMATION age. Information reigns king. It's valuable, yes. But trust is even more valuable. WP is a piece of open source community software, and decisions like this need to be done in the open with tons of feedback - not with a bit of code slipped in under the radar with no warning or discussion and absolutely no way of disabling it by default.

Just think about it. I haven't heard a _single_ argument that gives a real /reason/ for what's being done (no, "it's harmless" isn't a valid excuse). If it were ANY other for-profit company, each and everyone one of you would be screaming up and down. So why is WP an exception? Like I said before, Open Source isn't a carte blanche that lets you do whatever the hell you please, it's just a frikkin license - and doing this kind of stuff assuming that everyone would forgive you just because you're not a Microsoft/Google/Apple/eBay/Whatever doesn't just not get you off the hook but gives open source a really bad name if that's the excuse.

The golden rule: "Do unto others what you would have them do unto you" 

If someone can give me a SINGLE good reason why it's OK for WordPress to do this whereas it's not for anyone else, I'm all ears. But just think: "what if it was Microsoft" and see what happens.

Every day I see a blog post about "OMG <INSERT BIG COMPANY HERE> is using WP!!! WE PWNZ THE WORLD!!!" Cool.
Great. But what are all those big companies going to think when they realize you're effectively spying on them???

I fail to grasp your argument. The reasons for the data being sent are
straightforward and obvious, to notify the blogger about upgrades
being available for both WordPress and plugins. With all the security
issues lately, and so many people bitchin' about WordPress having
security problems, then keeping people in the know about upgrades is
an important thing to do.

I agree that not having an option to turn it off is an oversight. And
I agree that not having a stated privacy policy is ridiculous. But the
facts cannot be disputed.

For the record, matt has stated that the backend doesn't store
anything whatsoever. It uses the data sent to check for updates to the
given bits. That's it. In theory, it could use the same information to
keep a count of the installed WordPress base and what versions are
being run, for statistical reasons. For now, it doesn't do that.

As for discussion, this has been discussed on trac for *years*, there
was plenty of discussion and debate about it. #1476 springs to mind.

Look, as matt correctly pointed out, this sort of information is not a
security risk. Nobody not wearing tinfoil on their head would
reasonably have objections to this information being available.

The legitimate complaints are:
- No opt-out method built in
- No privacy policy
- Poor implementation from an optimization perspective.

Jumping up and down and going OMG IT SENDZ DATA OH NOEZ! doesn't help
things. It doesn't send any data that could be used against you.
Really. And they're not even saving it on their end. And it is, in
fact, easily disabled with two lines of code or a simple plugin, if
you're of the tinfoil hat variety.

But more to the point, don't be over-exaggerating things. I'll
certainly be putting in some patches to correct the deficiencies that
I see in it, and with any luck, they'll make it into 2.3.1. Hopefully
matt and such will step up and consider a wordpress.org privacy policy
and perhaps a mod for the installation to notify the user will make it
into the release as well.

This is not a world-ending problem. Okay? Version 2.3 isn't a security
release, so if you don't want it, don't install it yet.

-Otto

I just joined this mail list about three hours ago - but I think I've
already seen enough to feel inclinded to say:

It seems perfectly acceptable to me to collect unpersonalized stats ONLY IF
the blog administrator manually enables such functionality. Perhaps it's
already been suggested, but why not add a step to the upgrade.php script
that provides an unchecked check box asking the admin to check it if they
wish to donate statistics? Perhaps this functionality could be accessed as a
plugin that can be controlled at the admin's will?

Sorry if I'm jumping in too soon here, I really don't have the time to go
back through the log of the previous messages. But maybe that there is a yet
to be made suggestion.

Cheers friends,
  JT

I guess I mustn't have been very clear: I have no problem per-say with what's being sent, only how it's done and what's said about it.

I'm sorry, but even notifying people about upgrades doesn't stop their installs from being insecure. The sheer number of posts on Planet and everywhere else aren?t that different from anything...

And there are a million ways of doing this without sending any info (getting the remote version and *locally* comparing it and seeing if an update is needed), but that's not my point.

My ONLY point is with the lack of a visible option to disable this functionality, and why someone seems to think it's OK for WP to do this silently and secretly and it's not for other companies/software/organizations. (and, no, just because you can name someone else that does it doesn't make it OK :-)

Very simple patch attached:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5066#comment:4

Rundown:

If option check_updates is not set then no checks will be done. The nag screen asks the user (with manage_options permission) to select if they would like this feature enabled or not. It links to the privacy options page (where I put the option). Selecting yes or no will make the nag go away. I didn't separate options for core and plugins. That can easily be 2.3.1 or 2.4, but this quick and simple patch should be easy to get into 2.3 and help curve any problems.

I also included a little paragraph under the option saying what will be sent to the server to insure full transparency.

Just a note: the Milestone is set to 2.4 on this report, so there is 
very little chance it will be noticed for 2.3.

LOL thanks. I had set it to 2.3 and still had that tab opened - just forgot to submit it. This has definitely been a Monday.

Well, this is much more intrusive, for one thing. Also it's much more
specific. And it's considering plugins as well, which is nice, since a
lot of plugins were recently found to have security issues too.

> And there are a million ways of doing this without sending any info (getting the remote version and *locally* comparing it and seeing if an update is needed), but that's not my point.

Agreed, but Matt already addressed this in his thread, and I actually
agree with him on the reasoning there. It's possible to make it
smarter in one place instead of having to distribute your
intelligence. I tend to like having my servers do things too instead
of my clients. But that's just my opinion, of course.

> My ONLY point is with the lack of a visible option to disable this functionality, and why someone seems to think it's OK for WP to do this silently and secretly and it's not for other companies/software/organizations.

I agree with the need for an option, but I'm inclined to say that the
lack of it is an oversight, not an evil conspiracy. The functionality
shows that it has other deficiencies as well, and I think that lack of
this is more because they wanted to get working functionality out the
door and start getting blogs upgraded and making them more secure.
WordPress has been receiving a *lot* of criticism for being insecure
lately, a lot of which is somewhat unfounded. Getting the installed
base up to date would relieve a lot of that.

Anyway, if that's all your reaction is to, then I'd say you're
over-reacting somewhat, or at least it seems that way when you put it
into ASCII. ;)

Well, let's be fair, Jamie Holly. Matt is not just the voice behind WP, he's
actually put a bit of his back into it. I'm not aware of your contributions.
Would you mind a little sharing, even at the risk of self promotion?

I must say, it catches my breath to hear this accusation "it really gave a
sense that he (Matt) has something personally to profit/gain from this
feature." within FOUR WORDS of an admission that "I haven't looked into the
code enough yet."

*breath, Amy, breath!*

It is not uncommon to run into people who do not get the concept of "freely
offered." Open source is still so new, we are all learning the rules. Yes, a
fork is a legitimate choice and one should not take that as a negative
option. It's not like we are "forced" to use WordPress, lest anyone forget!

What isn't legitimate is for end users to develop a sense of entitlement
where we start to believe we have the right to call the shots and developers
must respond lickity split to what we say. They freely offer their code. We
can choose to use it. We can choose not to use it. If we like most of it,
but not all of it, we can even change it! We can even distribute our changes
to others. Get this - we can even charge for that distribution. I kid you,
not.

25 years in Information Technology and I pinch myself each and every single
day.

Now, I also want to warn against wandering into close proximately with
defamation
and libel <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slander_and_libel>. When ill intent
for personal profit is suggested, without evidence that such accusations are
actually true, one's reputation can be damaged. If such claims turn out to
be false claims, nearly every country in the world will find the victim was
defamed. In written form, the impact is considered to be more permanent by
the courts, resulting in a judgement of libel.

So, one must be very careful to not falsely accuse someone, and even then,
to never do so without having all of your ducks in a row - before committing
such an accusation to electronic form and distributing it broadly to those
on a mailing list and to anyone else who happens upon the Piper mail website
- whether that happens as a result of intentionally going to that site,
being linked there by others, or by scooping up the accusation in an
innocent Google search. Just try to delete it! There are Google archives,
too! Today, when we press send, it's forever!

Anyway, food for thought.

In closely, let me say, people often ask - how do we build more contributors
in our open source projects? As a "just off the top of my head" response,
might I suggest we not attack key contributors - at least so viciously?

Cheers!
Amy :-)

Yea and turns update checking off. It's stupid to turn of a whole
feature just because you don't want it to do something it doesn't need
anyway: transmit the url.

Has all been talked through on the stats collecting thread (not this
one). This one started, because I looked into the code yesterday because
I wanted to make sure my plugin works alright with the update system.
I pretty much gave up on this discussion. My minimum goal was to at
least md5 the URL or remove it, as it isn't needed - it works fine
without the URL.
I'm just a little plugin-dev - and it seems like I am the first one to
notice, although this is a long announced feature. Are there core devs
on this list? Or is it matt, some plugin-devs and the people who treat
php4 vs php5 as a religion? Or are there so few people really caring
about their privacy and security?
And I have to state this again: I would have had no, well much less a
problem with this whole thing if the URL would have been transmitted
separate to the version and the plugin data. It no ones business that I
have the admin-porn plugin running, which shows a beautiful woman on
every admin page. Just as well that nobody needs to know that I'm
running the old version of plugin xy.
Yes, you can do a brute force, but it's a hell lot more efficient (as
Matt pointed out) if you have a nice list of domains to attack.

Morty (Who is more sad then frustrated)

P.s.: Before anyone asks where to get the admin-porn plugin. You may add
it here: http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/

Public opinion is what it is; that is the reaction you will get if you
hear someone is scooping up information without disclosure. While one
should "never attribute to malice what can be attributed to
[oversight]", users have been burned by all sorts of nasties, and are
sensitized to this sort of thing now.

Very few people know how their computers work. We rely on trust. When
that trust is violated, or _feel_ that it's violated... well, it's
upsetting.

Yes, but at a point, with all good OS software, it becomes owned by the
community just as much as by the authors. One should not forget that
their software is neigh unto nothing without users, for free or for
profit. Clearly we have some lack of communication flow between the
two, and it's caused some misunderstanding and discord.

Also, on the web, one tends to develop a rather thick skin. Without
such, it's hard to stay sane. I'm sure that said contributors are able
to take e-mails like this with the grain of salt it deserves. More
aggravating, at least in my perspective, is managing the relationship
with the community -- doing something wildly unpopular can cause
backlash leading to a "I'll take my ball and go home" reaction. Again,
this is why it's critical for everyone to communicate and be clear.


If I may suggest, can we stop and analyze what went wrong here? What
could we have done to made sure that this issue came out sooner? How
can we -fix- the process, so that this is less likely to happen again?

Also, with the 2.3 release looming, I think it would be nice to know if
this issue is blocking or not. I have seen no posts on the development
blog one way or another on the matter.



Yours truly,

I never said he was profiting or gaining from it - I said it "gives a
sense". Sorry but saying something makes me feel a certain way in no-way
constitutes libel or defamation. If that was the case then the already
over-crowded dockets in the courts around the U.S. will explode.

Oh and did you know accusing someone of defamation and libel can also be
considered defamation and libel (that is from my wife, who is a civil
defense attorney)?


So your standards means someone has to "prove contributions" in order to
raise concerns on an open-source product? Well in my 30+ years - now my head
is exploding. I guess John Doe can't complain to Chevy because of a problem
with his truck if he doesn't work for GM. 

Yes I have contributed patches. Yes I have helped with tickets. Yes I try to
help out on WPMU forums. I will now be reevaluating the donating the limited
time I already have considering your "standards". I suggest others do the
same.

I'm sorry but you missed the entire point. When people are asking about
concerns (especially ones of security or privacy), a "key contributor"
should not respond by saying "fine go fork it or use something else". That
is exactly what occurred (and I think another developer even commented on
the tone of that statement). So attacking the people who also try to help
out, or use the product is a way to develop a community? Not in my book.

Matt clearly stated, and I'm to lazy to search the mail, that there will
be no changes whatsoever, and I'm free to change the software,
deactivate the whole function or start a fork.

When I tried wp_unschedule_event, a wp_next_scheduled_event still returned

I was under the mistaken impression that the trac milestone had closed
for this; in fact, there are about 20 minutes remaining. That said, it
is the 25th in half the world right now, and there is no 2.3 release as
of yet. Thus, I feel the question is still valid, especially in light
of the fact that most everyone has had a chance to sleep on it.

Then again, I've never waited for a WordPress release before, so I may
just be overly-anxious. :)

On Wednesday, noon PST in #wordpress-dev there will be a 2.3 wrap-up and 
a 2.4 planning discussion for developers. This will also be the restart 
of the weekly IRC meetup.

We will be trolling the ideas forum, trac tickets, and such and will 
decide what features or not we want to have in 2.4, and what timeline we 
think is reasonable for that. The hope is that development this time 
around can be a little more front-loaded than in the last two cycles.

If you're interested to contributing[1] to the 2.4 release, you should 
drop in.

Noon? What an inconvienant time (for me at least :P )... Besides, it's lunch

Maybe something later in the night might be better? I don't know...

Not everyone's in the US... 7pm PST would be 3, 4, 5am in Europe and 
even later in Asia and other places. I'm not sure about further east, 
but there are tons of major contributors from Europe: seems a bit unfair 
to leave them out.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Feed stats in WordPress or a plugin
Message-ID: <46F85AF6.1020801@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I've been thinking that it must be possible to integrate some (or maybe 
most) FeedBurner technology within WordPress. Given the lack of stats at 
the moment, I'm seeing a plugin to start with.

Anyone else interested on working on this? I haven't looked extensively 
at existing stats plugins, but I have looked for a feed stats plugin and 
can't find anything stable.

Any tips / tricks / pointers would be great. Also, if anyone knows more 
about how FeedBurner works that would be useful.

Cheers - Callum.

Right... Sorry, forgot about that. I'm not even in the US. Canada!

Does FeedBurner even have an API yet?

Yes it would, I'm not sure what went wrong with my thinking :P

I guess 8pm GMT isn't so bad.

I actually found this very nice little plugin last week:

http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/wordpress-reports/

It incorporates Feedburner and Google Analytics into a reports tab in the
admin section. Got to say it has been working really nice.

I have found in the past that 3pst (10pm GMT) works better for around the world meetings.  Noon which seems to be popular = too early (3-5am ) Asian time thus rules out any contributors from Asia / Australia, it is a fine balance getting the three Major Zones but the midday pst meetings just rules us out.

Too late - wp.org has a new graphic and the version.php version go

I replied with regard to this off-list directly to Matt, since I was
having some mailer issues. Since I can now post to the list properly
(yay), I suppose I should let everyone in on what that message was. :)

I'm having similar issues -- everything should be set up properly (at
least, it all shows up correctly on wordpress.org), but it's just not
showing any update for me in 2.3 RC1.

Is the plugin's "tested up to", or other data used to determine
upgrade-ability? Is there some better documentation on how author's are
supposed to integrate with this functionality (I haven't found any)

http://svn.wp-plugins.org/in-series/trunk/readme.txt (refers to 3.0.6)
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/in-series/tags/3.0.4 (non-updated test)
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/in-series/tags/3.0.6 (latest version)
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/in-series/ (reports 3.0.6)

Repro:

* Install In Series 3.0.4 on WP 2.3 RC1
* View the plugin admin page

Expect:
 The fact that there is an update should show up.

Actual:
 No update notification is presented.


Any help would be appreciated.


Thanks,

It's best to send these to me directly, without mailing-list looking 
subjects or headers, so it goes to my inbox and not the mailing list folder.

5AM is a bit early for me though :P (Sydney)

Could someone save a log of it and make it available for others to read through who dont get a chance to come along?
There'll probably be some discussion there that others will be interested in.

That was his response to me as well.  I offered what I thought were some reasonable alternatives to ignoring the real issue:

- If you "need" this data for some amazing feature that's only in your head, then you need to open the kimono now.  Otherwise, it just seems sneaky and underhanded.

- Be careful about suggesting that people fork WordPress for privacy purposes.  It won't take much for a Cory Doctorow to lead the charge to "take back WordPress".

- Here's what people will want to see from you:  "This is a good conversation.  Yes, we should only be collecting information that's absolutely necessary to enable features, and even then on an opt-in basis.  If there's ever a need to collect more, then we'll deal with that in an update rather than trying to pre-optimize for scearnios that we can only guess about now."

Whoever thought it was okay to push out 2.3 without resolving this privacy issue need to have the keys taken away.  For the "real" products I'm involved with, that person would find a security guard with a box waiting for them in the morning.

I don't expect this question to be answered, which is sad.

Been using that plugin for probably a year now or something and it works
decent. I have issues with it pulling my GA stats, but it works like a charm
for FeedBurner. :)

and on a more to the point tone:

I intend to add rss stats to FireStats in one of the next versions,
anyway - this is what I know so far:

1. some rss agregattors sends the number of subscribers in the user agent.

2. you need to somehow identify a distinct reader, probably by a
combination of ip and useragent.

3. when trying to figure out the number of readers, look for said
distinct readers within a certain time window. at least 24 hours, but I
think even a few days (5-7 days?)

There's been a couple of problems with the way the plugins directory  
( http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ ) has synced its data with the  
subversion repository during this last day or so.

I'm resyncing the data now and am fixing the cause as well, but if  
you see one of your plugins is out of date, that's why.

It should all be working again by Sept 25 6PM PST.

I want stats but sacrificing the privacy of my readers is just too high

I hear you.

I stopped using FB as soon as google bought them, and mentally bumped 
the priority of supporting feed stats in FireStats.

Thank you for including this info in the WP 2.3 announcement:

    Our new update notification lets you know when there is a new
    release of WordPress or when any of the plugins you use has an
    update available. It works by sending your blog URL, plugins, and
    version information to our new api.wordpress.org service which then
    compares it to the plugin database and tells you what the latest and
    greatest is you can use.

Now I feel I can simply translate that without worries about disclosure
on that front.

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

Then you called wp_unschedule_event with the wrong parameters or
something. Dunno. Works for me.

Why are you so down on Google?

Be specific, please, I have no time for tinfoil hat paranoia. ;-)

I just upgraded to WP 2.3 last night, and I noticed I lost my styling on my
Category & Links widgets in my sidebar. I'm not terribly surprised, what
with the taxonomy changes for tags/categories/links. My question is,
where/how are the links and categories widgets called, so that I can update
my theme's stylesheet? I've spent all morning looking through widgets.phpand
taxonomy.php, but I'm not sure I'm looking in the right spot. Thanks!

That's it? That's all you've got? "Google collect information, and use
it to profit."

Okay, that's not a particularly good reason to dislike them, in my
opinion. Of course they use information to profit. I mean, so do I. So
does everybody. :P


Do they do anything that's actually, you know, bad?

This e-mail thread found it's way onto slashdot, by the way.  As usual,
there's a lot of spin.

Personally, I object to the amount and scope of data they collect.

They use one cookie to track you across all services. So they can link 
your google searching to your mail, calendar, homepage (feeds, etc). 
Then they provide google analytics, thus they can track you across lots 
of other sites.

Collecting all that data is not evil per se, the part that I dislike is 
that you can't opt-out. If you use their services, they'll track you. I 
can't ask them to delete my data, nor do they publish a policy on when 
(or if ever) data will be deleted.

Thus I block google-analytics.com, use a Scroogle (a google scraper) and 
run all my google traffic proxied through a single IP. My tinfoil hat 
gets a good workout! :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] 2.3 Response
Message-ID: <46F941E3.5090503@mullenweg.com>

I've just finished reading through the 323 pingbacks (!) currently on 
the 2.3 announcement post. (At least the ones in English.) Here's a 
sampling of what people are saying:

http://www.evansims.com/thoughts/wordpress-23-impressions/
"All in all, I?d say 2.3 is a fantastic upgrade for any Wordpress user, 
and the team has done a fantastic job with it."

http://tensixteen64.com/journal/2007/09/25/upgrade-complete/
"I then ran the upgrade script, reactivated all my plugins. Downloaded 
the updates for the plugins that needed upgrading. *That?s SO cool! I 
love being notified when an upgrade is needed!*"

http://www.ivovic.net/2007/09/25/wordpress-23/
"So, with version 2.3 we now have native tagging support, and I think 
that?ll do me for the foreseeable future? that is, until they decide to 
add something else I really like."

http://www.thebetanews.com/the-beta-news-are-now-running-wordpress-23/
"Then I ran the upgrade script and that was it."

http://manukhanna.com/wordpress/wordpress23/
"As always, the installation went off like a breeze."

http://designadaptations.com/notebook/dont-mind-the-construction/
"Clicktags is much faster, because it turns your tags into ?buttons? you 
can view and click to add to the entry field (similar to an option in 
the now defunct UTW), but if you have many tags it also takes up a lot 
of room."

http://www.limetouch.com/2007/09/25/released-wordpress-23/
"Needless to say, I have already upgraded and successfully imported all 
my tags from Simple Tagging to WordPress. I have also integrated them 
into my theme and updated the category association for my links which 
were put on hold due to the pending release of 2.3."

http://bloggingexperiment.com/archives/new-wordpress-features-released.php
"I?m continually amazed at the number of features and improvements 
WordPress continually makes. If you?re not using this platform your 
blog, you really should give it a shot. If there?s something you want 
that it doesn?t have, wait a while and chances are they?ll be adding it 
soon."

There was only one post about the blog URL/update issue:

http://just-thinkin.net/2007/09/wordpress-23-privacy-issue-your-opinions-please/

Luke-warm:

http://geminigeek.com/blog/archives/2007/09/upgraded-wordpress-23/
"The transition from UTW to WP2.3 native tagging is rather painless, 
though there?s some iffy-ness somewhere in between. Now here?s a few 
things I don like about tagging in WP2.3"

There were some negative posts, but not that many:

http://www.toxic-web.co.uk/blog/2007/09/25/toxic-web-40/
"First thing being it?s native tag support, which means UTW should be 
redundant but again, as with past major upgrades, they seem to have done 
certain things half arsed and many of the things UTW does in one package 
needs more plugins in 2.3 - you?d think they?d have included some way of 
managing the tags."

http://www.scamcity.co.uk/journal/2007/09/25/wordpress-23-thoughts/
"So WordPress 2.3 has just been released, and like I lot of people I 
uploaded and upgraded but then I reverted..."

Scam City also says in the comments:
"I dunno, I am a bit disillusioned with the running of WordPress and how 
the emphasis is on the .com while the .org is left to waste most of the 
time."

Which I think is pretty demonstrably not true. Anyone want to run stats 
on the SVN repo or Trac?

http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2007/09/wordpress_woes.html
"I just upgraded my Wordpress blog, Coffee & Complexity, to version 2.3. 
It broke, horribly, despite me following all the recommended steps."

http://kainzy.org/2007/09/25/dfbdfhdrfh/
"I?m still not sure what has happened but my Extended Live Archives 
setup went totally wrong and threw a major wobbly, which resulted in me 
disabling the thing, then Ultimate Tag Warrior went a bit mental. The 
Archives page looks a bit poorly now as a result."

Note: In the future we'll know plugin popularity and can mention the 
most popular ones specifically in a release, it seems Google Sitemaps 
and Extended Live Archives are mentioned frequently.

http://blog.plasticmind.com/cms/why-you-should-upgrade-to-mt4/
"All of WP 2.3?s new features have been in MT for years."

Being on a platform that just got user registration and paginated 
archives last month must make you bitter. I'll leave making a chart 
showing the number of years the "What's new in MT4" features have been 
in WP as an exercise to the reader. They're even copying our 
open-sourceness. :)

It's shocking how inaccurate that is. If anyone has a few spare moments 
to drop some sanity in that discussion it would be a big help. It was 
obviously written by someone with malicious intent toward WordPress.

Yea, and unfortunately it seems that I failed say what I wanted to. 
Everyone is talking about this being part of the update information 
system, which it isn't. It only for statistics. And nobody seems to get 
the difference between transmitting URL and plugin data separately to 
transmitting them together.
Seems like having a gray position isn't very popular. Or maybe it's just 
too complicated that to things are not that dangerous by them selves as 
they are linked to each other. :-/

Cheers Morty

Okay, I get you here, but... is there anything specifically evil that
they could do with that data that you object to? Because this sort of
paranoia just seems very, very theoretical to me.

I mean, I'm trying to understand here, but I never have gotten this
sort of thing. I remember when I used to be big on the Tivo forums,
and a lot of people objected to Tivo collecting statistics on
everything everybody watched (anonymous stats, as I went to great
effort to prove).They did have an opt-out, but it was somewhat
cumbersome, but nevertheless, I failed to see then, and am failing to
see now, why anybody would care?

In the case of Tivo, it knew what everybody watched and when, more or
less. Their idea was to sell this information to TV networks (like
Neilsen data). Now, to me, that seemed like a damn good idea that
could only benefit me. I don't care if anybody knows what television I
watch, and in fact I'd like the TV networks to make more of the types
of shows I watch.

So... why the paranoia on that data collection? A lot of people were
really up in arms about it, and I never did find out why from any of
them.
-Stupid crap like "they're collecting this data and using it to make
money!" Well, yeah, so what? I was not aware that making money by
selling useful information to people who want it was wrong.
-Or something equally stupid like "we should be reimbursed for our
data!" The problem with that idea is that your data is worthless. It's
only useful in aggregate, as statistical information. Expecting to get
so much as a penny for your data is overestimating its worth. Also,
you weren't getting paid for it before, why should you get paid for it
now? You're not doing anything to earn money, you're watching TV, same
as you did before.
-Sometimes I saw "They can figure out what shows I watch!" Well, no,
it was actually anonymous, however in theory, yes, it would be
possible. But here's the thing: They don't care what *you* watch. Get
over yourself, nobody is interested in you, you're not a high profile
target. They're interested in trends among large groups. A salesman
who tries to sell to one person is an idiot, because the salesman who
tries to sell to large groups of people makes the real money.

Anyway, this is another case of that same kind of thing. What does
Google *actually* do that's harmful to you in particular? Nothing that
I can see. The data they collect is data that can't hurt me. I don't
care who knows what websites I view. Hey, quite a lot of them are
porn. :)

I just read quite a lot of that. Sorry, but I'm just unable to achieve
that level of paranoia without some kind of pharmaceutical
intervention. ;-)

Matt:
I'm not you (obviously), but I think you need to get out ahead of this
one, pronto, before digg, reddit, propellor, etc. get wind and blow it
even further out of proportion.  Put down your thoughts, either on
Photomatt or on the Dev Blog, explain your reasoning (especially as to
why it coming to a head so late in the release cycle weighed upon
committing changes that would reverse it) and then submit it to
Slashdot, etc.  Make a nice "Lead WordPress developer responds to
'privacy' complaints" headline and see what shakes out.

Just my $.02.

Well, it is part of the update system. It's not currently *necessary*
for the update system to function, but still...

Well, I understand the difference, but I still disagree with you. The
information itself is not noteworthy. Somebody who knows all this
information knows nothing of importance. It's not actually information
that they can use against you.

Actually they're not dangerous either way. A lot of people run "lists
of plugins I'm running" on their blog. Is that dangerous?

IMHO it is. Once you start hacking systems you do get careful. (E.g. I 
shut down my WLAN quite quickly and redesigned my home network after 
hacking my WEP-key )

All things considered, congratulations on another great release :)

Most everyone I've spoken to is pretty impressed with the tagging, and devs are liking the new (clean!) taxonomy schema.

While I agree with Morty, I think most of the public "reaction" to this issue isn't so much about security or the data being transmitted but just the fact that it's being done without a button to disable it.

Just my 2 fils.

Nice work, Matt.  *grin* They just updated the story (the notorious

Good news, the article has been updated. The new title: "WordPress 2.3 
Does Not Spy On Users [UPDATED]".

My thanks to kdawson and the intelligent commenters on the thread. My 
faith in Slashdot is restored. :)

Nice one :)

I guess someone out there isn't familiar with the term "mailing list" and that "arguments" and "flamewars" like this one aren't really that big of a deal in the long-run :D

The problem is I kinda saw this reaction coming and, had Matt not
reacted quickly and /. not posted the correction, further damage to
WP's overall reputation could have been done, and fast.

Everybody in the newspaper industry knows that sensationalism runs on
page A1, corrections on  D41, so once the (incorrect) cat is out of
the bag, the damage has been done.

Get Firebug and use the "Inspect Element" command to find out.

Meanwhile... id="category" was changed to id="category-1" (you can
have more than one).

I didn't think that link changed at all.  I can't easily check because
I had to modify my links to handle multiple links without repeating IDs.

Ciao!

As long as accurate information is available to reasonable people, I 
think WordPress will be fine. There is *a lot* of FUD and outright lies 
spread about the project by people with various motivations but truth is 
the best defense. (And continuing to have a kickass product.)

Irregardless of WordPress calling home with URL and plugin info (my 2
cents: not too bad, but it should be a core option), people seem to be
glossing over this.  What is Akismet sending during each spam check?

$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER']
$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW']
$_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION']

If you have a basic HTTP AUTH (.htaccess, etc) set up on top of
WordPress (or I believe WordPress itself has an option for using HTTP
AUTH instead of cookie sessions), you are sending usernames and
passwords.

I'm not accusing Automattic of doing this intentionally, but this is a
MAJOR security problem.

Akismet does send *and use* the $_SERVER variables in a spam check, 
however it excludes with this line:

$ignore = array( 'HTTP_COOKIE' );

If you file a patch to that array with the other variables you think 
shouldn't be in there I'll get it in. BTW, Akismet's privacy policy is here:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Password Handling Improvements - Trac Ticket #2870
Message-ID: <46F95775.4020504@gmail.com>

I'm referring to this: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2870

I would have to make a new patch if we were to decide to put it in 2.4, 
but I just wanted to see what other people think.

I know people probably don't create as secure passwords at the system 
does, but they're going to change it to what they want and it will be 
easier to just allow them, if they want, to make their own when they 
create a new installation. I say that we can take the middle ground of 
having a checkbox that can be checked if you would rather have WP create 
a password. If the user wants to create his own, it would have a 
password and confirm password box.

Any other ideas?

What information is used?  I'm not saying that to be a jerk (indeed,
looking through a dump I could find some use for some of the _SERVER
variables, especially for something like Akismet), but my point is
this sort of data gathering should be by include, not exclude.  That
way it's not prone to accidental sensitive information leakage (as
what is happening here).

That being said, since this is an immediate problem, here's a patch
that will solve this specific problem.

The good news is that, at the end, another myth is squashed, which*
helps* image rather than damages it. There was a recent scenario just
like this which involved Con Kolivas and Linus Torvalds.

I think a large part of the objection to changing it at this point may not
necessarily be the nature of the issue itself (or lack of clarity /
understanding) but rather the timeliness of the complaint.

Regarding the transmission of the URL, it's certainly up for debate whether
the PR value of not sending it outweighs the potential future benefits of
including it.

It probably does (IMHO) even assuming, as I think most of us do, that it
would never be used for "evil" purposes. :)

However, this particular thread was just too late in the game to consider
for this release. 2.3 had been in bug-fix-only mode for quite a while.
There's already a trac ticket (#5066) for this, so hopefully we can just
discuss that in a calm and rational manner (for a future release) going
forward.

Hey, the good thing is that we have an update mechanism in place to change
it quickly later on if that's deemed appropriate. :)

Great. This should quell some concerns people have, especially since the
promise of good intent (didn't know how else to put it) is now in written
text and displayed on the website.

Sigh... you can always count on digg to beat a dead horse into the ground,
even on an issue that's already been clarified / corrected in the linked
post / story.

Congrats on your quick and appropriate response. Hopefully (as you said)
that will serve to keep the reasonable people reasonable, and there's not
much we can do about everyone else.

<snip>

As with most information-gathering on such a large scope, it's only a
matter of time. It almost always starts out innocently (we need
statistics; this helps us better serve our customers; you can't be
personally identified; etc.), then gets twisted by law enforcement, the
government[1], criminals, or (if you are lucky) academics. Just as a
hypothetical example, Google's information on me could be used by the
(US) government for profiling and generating data in the no-fly list.
The data collection itself isn't evil, but large warehouses of data
-attract- people who would do nefarious things with it.

I have a well-defined public- and private-life. I try my best not to
mix business and pleasure. Who I hang out with, my political and
religious views, hopes and wishes for myself, thoughts on humanity, and
more, are -personal- until I wish to make them otherwise. Google, being
such an omnipresent thing, can still monitor, cross-reference, and
correlate without any distinction between the two. Without taking
explicit steps on my part, it becomes impossible to separate the
private from the public interests. Now, I'm not quite scared enough of
my government that blogging out against this-or-that will get me into
any serious trouble, but in several governments it can. If I decide one
day I want to know more about how bombs work, though, I'm uncertain
whether or not that will come back to haunt me if I want to take a
plane somewhere.

Collection is not evil -- it is merely dangerous. It is the eventual
uses of that data, oftentimes uses that were not even originally
thought of[2] or thought possible[3], that turn out to be evil. Do not
underestimate the power of large volumes of data, especially data that
you cannot alter or control. It is -your- data, and nobody else's; it is
reasonable to expect that we be able to treat is as such.

To clarify, is the following meant to suggest that users, by
downloading and running WordPress, have consented to the transfer of
their potentially personally-identifying plugin and URL data to the
employees of WordPress.org?

No. Nonsense. I'm not going to buy the slippery slope argument. It's
crap no matter how many times it gets repeated.

So, here's the standard counter-argument: Given X set of data, show
what bad thing Y could be done with it. I mean, you don't get to say
"they're collecting data, and it's *possible* to do bad things with
data!" Because it's possible to do bad things with a tire iron too...
Or you can fix your tires with it.

Instead of saying "oh no, don't collect data" why not look at each and
every instance of data collection and determine specific risks and
rewards, and then make your decision on the basis of logic and reason?
You know, like we do with everything else in this world?

There must be something wrong with it - it's in clear English and I
understood it all. I have no lawyerish tendencies, but it looks good to
me.

To me it basically says: We can do what with the data what we want as
long as we think it's ok to do that. But maybe it's just my paranoia. ;-)

I think generating passwords automatically is a good idea. I think 
overall, it will lead to a net gain in security. I'd support lengthening 
the password though, and definitely changing the algorithm that builds 
them. I notice there's a lot of numbers in them (I set up a lot of wp 
installs on a dev server).

I'd also be in favour of storing the passwords differently, adding a 
unique salt value with each user and storing the md5 of the password 
plus the salt. That would protect user accounts from rainbow attacks. 
Anyone else think it's worth the effort?

Cheers - Callum.

I agree, the replies are getting way off topic. This will be my last 
post on the subject.

I don't think Google _is_ doing anything dangerous with the data right 
now. They're open about wanting to map users behaviours more and more 
accurately to deliver "targetted" services like advertising, products, 
entertainment, etc. That's not evil per se, however, the lack of ability 
to opt-out is critical.

The average user doesn't read Google's privacy policy. You don't need to 
agree to Ts&Cs before you use their service. So if you use their site 
for 6 months, then decide you're not happy with the way they collect 
data on you, I believe you should have the right to have that data deleted.

Anyway, to avoid a flamewar, I realise that it's a little tin-foil-hat 
behaviour, but hey, that's the beauty of freedom right, we can each 
choose our own path! :)

Here's to buying shares in tin mines! - Callum.

By going on the internet you are treading in a public space.  If you don't
want to be tracked, don't go there.

Anyone with a web site can track your visit, your ISP and any contractor
they ever used can know every byte that comes and goes to your computer, any
government whose borders your IP packet crosses, heck, anyone with a $295
network sniffer can know more about you than you ever dreamed of.  Even
anonimizers aren't safe, all someone would have to do is track the packets
going in and out of them, compare content, match back to the source packet
and voila, they have your real IP.

Fifty years ago it was commies, 40 years ago it was "the man", 20 years ago
it was multi-national corporations, 10 years ago it was Microsoft, today
it's Google.  You really need to get more foil, man, the hat's looking
pretty thin.

Message-ID: <46F98298.1050608@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

There are currently 112 messages on the Plugin update & security / 
privacy thread. Would anyone care to give a _neutral_ and _unbiased_ 
summary of the discussion?

By the time I saw the thread it was already huge. I'm sure there are 
others who won't trawl through the 100+ messages but would be interested 
to know the status of the discussion.

If the summary could be say 3 areas, 5 bullet points for each area, just 
to avoid endless ranting? Also, could I ask anyone who's taken a strong 
stance on the topic _not_ to post a summary. It would be good to get a 
fairly neutral viewpoint.

Cheers - Callum.

If people use the new plugin update check and update their plugins
regularly, that shouldn't be a problem anymore. The Sitemaps plugin
was ready for WP 2.3 since 4th of September.

Maybe we could modify the plugin management page to check the "Tested
up to" tag of installed plugins and warn the user if it is lower than
the new installed version and he tries to activate it. Or introduce a
definitely-doesn't-work-with-omg field and warn the use even more ;)

Best regards,

  Arne

A salt would be a good idea. Maybe we can do like registration time + 
sha1 of password?

Better, allow the salt to be overridden in wp-config.php for those of
us who choose to.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Forced Upgrades after a failed "completion"
Message-ID: <7cf9ae490709251540q3f4625b0re4f3083c28825a9c@mail.gmail.com>

Is there anyway for you to force an upgrade after a failed completion?

Long story (sort of) short; I'm using SVN to upgrade all of my sites with my
own repository because of a stupid svn configuration mistake on one of the
files resulted in the the automatic svn update from completing, some files
were added/deleted/updated and some were left to 2.2.3. Of course I didn't
check my logs and went ahead to load a few of the sites admins. As _we_
would expect the outcome was not good, the main error refereed to the
"'prefix_terms' doesn't exist" (sorry I should have kept the full output,
instead I'm relying on Google History which I don't have any
privacy/security qualms :) ).

I ended up restoring the db to the latest dump and running the upgrade
script again. What I can't explain is how the upgrade worked against a
backup that was *after* the initial 2.3 upgrade, I did get duplicate errors
which were telling me that those portions of the db were already
created/updated.

Like I said I'm not sure how this worked and I can only blame myself for
overlooking what caused the problem, at least the second oversight resulted
in a second upgrade that "fixed" the site/db.

So what is the Upgrade checking prior to running, is there a flag to
manually reset (which was somehow reset in my import) would it be to
dangerous to add a "let's try again" for core updates? Or should I have not
admitted this and kept it to myself?


Thanks.

That is if the new update checking is working for all plugins which it is not.

I had hoped the api.wordpress was checking that already but cannot be sure.  We have requested to Matt on how the entire version checking works as api.wordpress is a undocumented black box.

I've attempted to stick to matters of fact. I admit my knowledge is not
complete, and mark such sections where I know this to be the case.
Statements with a side attached are marked for (P)ro (the current
implementation is fair and reasonable), (C)on (the current
implementation should be changed), (B)oth (the fact could be used
to argue either way), and (N)either (the fact makes no difference to
whether a change in the code should be made at some point, but may
have otherwise been relevant to -this release-).

I have tried to group topically relevant facts together, and
limited myself to the most prominent/frequent topics I could recall
(which, of course, may introduce my personal bias). If anybody thinks
they do smell a bias, let me know. :)


  * B: The update feature is very important

  * C: Information is being transmitted that is not strictly necessary
to provide the service

  * B: The non-necessary information could be used for something in the
future

  * P: Information is not being stored

  * C: Information could possibly be stored

  * P: Plugins are available to disable the feature entirely

  * P: It is possible to send fake data (URL, more plugin details than
are needed) and still utilize the service

  * C: There is no method in the core UI to disable transmission of
extra data (e.g., in the "privacy" tab)

  * B: Blog URLs are transmitted, allowing for statistical analysis

  * C: There [was] no information collection disclosure

  * P: A disclosure was made in the release post

  * C: There [was] no privacy/usage policy

  * P: A privacy policy has been added to wordpress.org

  * (Unknown: How users are informed of the privacy policy.)

  * N: The complaints came very, very late in the RC. The feature was
added several weeks prior.

  * (Unknown: When, where and if the implementation was discussed;
which stakeholders were present, if any.)

  * P: There are other ways to implement the update functionality

That FAQ entry, isn't particularly good. If you were going to try and
force a db upgrade, you would want to choose the db version that
corresponds to the version you were previously on.

See upgrade_all() in wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php .

If you're not going to use SHA-512, then you MUST read this excellent article on the topic of correct storage procedures for passwords in databases by Jeff Atwood: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000953.html

It's a must-read for anyone storing passwords or other sensitive info in the DB that you don't NEED to have the original value for.

Awesome, I need to start memorizing the codex or become patient in my
searches of the codex.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <000001c7ffcd$2a303750$6701a8c0@kergan>

Much of the discussion is blah blah, really...


- The WP update notification procedure collects more information than it
needs to; Someone who deals with privacy-aware people raised a concern

- (Lots of trolling on the topic...)

- Matt dismissed the concern (the information is not stored and who cares if
it is), and pointed out a means to disable the WP update notification
procedure entirely as a workaround

- (More trolling...)

- Someone vented his frustration on slashdot (and digg?); Matt reprioritized
his day and sought to douse what now amounted to a greek fire

- (More trolling still...)

- Matt posted a privacy policy on wordpress.org in an effort to terminate
the discussion


The privacy policy personally left me scratching my head:

"WordPress.org collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
WordPress.org" and "visitors can always refuse to supply
personally-identifying information" are simply not true. These two points
were what the trolling was all about in the first place.


Bottom-line:

- WP 2.3 got released as is

- The update procedure still collects more information than it needs to

- The privacy policy could use some correction, and maybe a lawyer's touch


Hope this helps...

Yes, but it's a dangerous game.  It's could've all been easily preempted and avoided.

That would be a good goal for future releases that want to send additional unnecessary information for no reason.   :O)

IMO you missed the security point.
And Probably B should be: Both sides agree on.

And I don't completely understand the following points

Otherwise I think at least I can live with that list. :-)

As far as I understood it, this was implemented by Matt, and if so -
nobody who reviewed it had a concern. None the less there was a
discussion on this group about collecting statistical data (When, where
to opt in or to opt out and whether to submit the data by php or the
browser, to make the origin even harder to track ) But all the people
participating in this discussion were not aware that this was already
implemented. Unfortunately nobody aware of this already being
implemented posted a comment.
I'm not sure whether the thread was on Matts ignore list. But if it
wasn't this thing should have been foreseeable for him, but thats my
personal opinion.

I hope this wasn't to biased. ;-)

That would be nice. That would take away quite a bit of the bad feeling.
Also it would be great if the code which is used to pack the plugins is
made public. I'd like to write a patch against it.

Thats a good article, But theres one thing i hate about the articles about salting:
Salting prevents Rainbow table lookup, but if your having to store the salt along with the password, It wont do anything to prevent a brute force attack, or a targetted rainbow table.

The article says that the aim of the game is to make the salt long enough that the string is too long to be brute forced, but hold up there, If they're stored together, then you've allready got the first 128 characters of the hashed string(the salt), therefor the brute force attack is now going to take the same time regardless if the password is stored with a salt or not.

So:
Yes, Salting with a per-blog specific value is a good idea, One that doesnt change between upgrades of WP too.
Yes, Salting with a per-user specific value is a great idea.
No, Salting does not prevent brute force attacks if its possible to access both hash and salt.
Yes, Salting prevents the use of most pre-made rainbow tables, However, If the salt used is constant for all users of a blog, and an attacker can get the salt, then a rainbow table can easily be created for that specific blog (And given the hardware performance of today and most passwords being relitivly short, it wouldnt take long).

So the outcome? Adding a salt will prevent the use of Generic Rainbow tables.

But whats the hashing speed of MD5 these days? Anything from 50 to 500 hash's a second on todays average hardware can be expected it seems, Theres probably more efficient algorithms too, keeping in mind that many passwords will not be cryptographicaly secure, my last password could be cracked within a few minutes with brute force, And i thought it looked pretty random secure -- Aparantly i was wrong.

Michael,

I know this isn't relevant to the topic at hand, but it was pointed
out on #wordpress that the download link for the Paged Comments plugin
[1] is broken. It returns a 404.

Something to do with the brackets in the name of the tag [2] perhaps?

Since theres a thread here, I thought maybe someone could take a peak into one of my plugins which has never worked correctly, and i've never spotted whats wrong with it:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ddeviantart/
SVN: http://svn.wp-plugins.org/ddeviantart/trunk
As far as i've been able to tell the readme's are correct, and they pass through the Parser Ok

It also Displays "Topic not found." if you try to rate it (By first rating i just gave it worked for the first time ever, but it now fails again) which seems to tell me that its not fully working with the bbPress underlay(I assume its bbPress at least)

http://photomatt.net/2007/08/13/standard-argument/

"Discussions are dominated chiefly by people who have time to dominate 
discussions, which over time includes fewer and fewer of the people who 
actually should."

July and August, two months which had heightened activity on wp-hackers 
had the lowest participation from any core developers, including myself.

Arguments over floating boxes and whether to use radio buttons or 
checkboxes go on for twenty posts between people who don't realize that 
the feature was implemented in core weeks before.[1]

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-September/014723.html

People talking past each other about PHP5 (AFTER a decision had been 
made) generates hundreds of posts, yet Alex's post about unit tests, 
which has the potential to have a real impact on the quality of WP in 
the future, thuds with nary a response.

http://blue.bikeshed.com/

Unreasonable arguments, personal attacks, flame wars... the things that 
have been generating most of the discussion on this list have little to 
do with the success (or failure) of WordPress, unfortunately that means 
the people who work the hardest day to day in the trenches will avoid or 
batch their time here.

Perhaps a new mailing list with moderated membership, or that was only 
open to those who had made substantive contributions to the codebase 
would be a good middle ground between private discussions, IRC, and 
wp-hackers. I honestly don't know.

 > Unfortunately nobody aware of this already being

I posted to the thread, though, on 9-15-2007:

[1] Which I pointed out:
http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-Automatic-feedback-from-users-p12696664.html

I'm not directing this at anyone personally, which is why I've started a 
new thread even though I'm quoting a previous one, but I think everyone 
should take a step back and examine what exactly we're doing when we 
press the button that sends a message to the 940 members of this list.

Assuming a system like this:

$password_hash = MD5( MD5($salt) . MD5($plain_text_password) );
Where $password_hash and $salt are the db columns....

The salt should NEVER be constant, or else what's the point of it? It just becomes a "customized MD5" function instead of a stock MD5, nothing more.

But you should have a different salt for each user, so that even if it is stored in plaintext in the same database and is compromised along with the password hashes, the hacker will have to - in the best case scenario - look up each and every row in the db individually... whether by rainbow tables or brute force attacks...

Whereas if no salt is deployed or a constant salt is used, the end result doesn't change: a single brute force attack and find *all* the passwords simultaneously... Only benefit of a constant salt is that renders previously created rainbow tables useless.... but that's no biggie.

This is what a users table should look like for security:

.................................
| ID |  NAME  | PASSHASH | SALT |
|...............................|
| 1  | Alpha  | 13e3ee4  | abc8 |
| 2  | Beta   | EU8ea&$  | axa! |
| e  |  t     |    c     |  .   |
.................................

That's about as secure as you can get (especially if you don't use MD5).

Feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken, it's been a while since my last crypto-related project.

Yes.  Tags are currently only downloadable if they consist of only  
numbers and periods.  I've clarified the FAQ to address that.

It sounds like a bug though to me :)  I'll look into it more; we can  
make it a bit more flexible.

This is kind of pointless seeing as it's not really the question; but that's the reason I prefer forums (public or private) to mailing lists: easier to keep track of what's important, easier to categorize, and easier to moderate :)

I actually found the problem, and it had nothing to do with the taxonomy
changes - apparently someone misspelled categories as "catgories", so the
widget is now part of the "widget widget_catgories" class.

... this rather irritates me, because it never showed up in 
*wp-testers*. I asked about automated testing in May[1]. I spent
several months developing tests in my spare time with SimpleTest so
that I could finally automate testing on my plugin. This is exactly the
kind of post that would've spurred me to response, but I never -got-
it, because I wasn't subscribed to this list.

Why is there a list for testers if important stuff like this isn't
posted to it?

To be fair, unit tests are not something that non-professionals in the
trade understand or care about, much.

Just saying that real user, or even wp-hacker, input is not something
to avoid either. A group of people who really know their stuff is not
going to come up with the same things as the people actually working
with and implementing the same stuff in the field.

Different groups have different concerns, and neither group should be neglected.

I am +1 on that, wp-hackers generates a LOT of noise making it very hard for us the plugin developers to talk to the WP Core Team, we need a better way to communicate with you the core WP developers on issues and also design concerns etc..

Gallery2 has a core developers list and a developers list, maybe this is not a bad way to go with WP..

Thanks for the update Mike, I noticed a number of ZIP building issues etc lately so fingers crossed on getting the issues worked out..

Thanks on updating the FAQ, if you do not mind we would love to see some more information on how the version checking is working and what impact the Tested up to and the Requires at least tags have in the README if you know these things..

I thought Testers was a list mainly for those who do not wish to follow core development work, but want to test the final components, I'm subscribed to both lists, and the only time wp-testers really has any great traffic is around releases where they're bring ing up problems thats appearing in the builds. The direction of the Core is never really discussed in that.

Personally i dont use IRC(as it mainly requires real-time communication), But another list might make sense, But at the same time, it could be a bad idea, It might push some people away if they cant get posting access.

A new (open post-by-invite-only)list specifically for those who do most of the core work might be able to work, but if that was to work, anything that should require community input would have to be posted to the wp-hackers list, And theres allways someone who will have a useful opinion who wouldnt be able to post to get frustrated; At the same time, it wouldnt be able to be closed list as others wouldnt be able to see the discussion and would feel that "WordPress is controlled by a select few, so much for the community".
I can however see that there'd just end up 2 lists with the same topics.. Ie. someone posts an issue on wp-hackers, devs talk about it on wp-private, some in wp-hackers dont get the messages and dont realise whats happened.   A Topic is raised in wp-private, and since others cant reply, posts get sent to wp-hackers and people talk about it there..

Nope, Its still the same, The headings appear, but no text does.

Run http://svn.wp-plugins.org/ddeviantart/trunk/readme.txt through http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/validator/ and the text shows up, but its refused to show up on wordpress.org since i created the plugin. (I just havnt had the time to chase it up as i thought it was my readme.txt's fault)
If you run the tagged readme: http://svn.wp-plugins.org/ddeviantart/tags/0.3/readme.txt through the validator its ok too.

Allthough the Voting now works.. (It didnt earlier)

Try 500 *thousand*, and that's lowballing it. Also, bear in mind that
brute-forcing hashes is embarrassingly parallel[1], so it can take
full advantage of your multicore machines, clusters, botnets,
whatever. MD5 is fast, and getting faster.

You're completely right. The time spent reading Atwood's article would
have been better spent reading the one by Thomas Ptacek[2] that he
selectively quoted from.

[2]: http://www.matasano.com/log/958/enough-with-the-rainbow-tables-what-you-need-to-know-about-secure-password-schemes/

The aim of the salt isn't to make *individual* passwords harder to
brute-force; it's to make it take a hundred times longer to crack a
hundred passwords than it does to crack just one. That's all.

The strength of the system lies in making it impractical to
brute-force even one, let alone a hundred. MD5 doesn't give you that.

I'm not seeing my plugin as "out of date" per se -- but I have six
screenshots, only one is showing up, and it has the wrong caption
assigned to it...

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/in-series/screenshots/

That said, it's somewhat of an improvement over yesterday,
when only one caption and -no- screenshots were showing.

I assume this is related to the issue you're working on; please correct
me if I'm in left field. :)

Exactly. Couldn't have said it better myself... =D Well, there are some 
times though that the "issues/problems" with (alphas, betas, and rc) 
versions are discussed on Hackers list too. However, it's not really THE 
LIST for doing that though...

Testers list = reporting issues/problems with (alphas, betas, and rc) 
versions. Discussing possible fixes for those issues/problems, including 
adding possible tickets on trac... Discussing possible theme and plugin 
issues on said (alpha, beta, rc) versions as well. So "we all" have an 
idea of what's going on, and how when things go wrong.

Hackers list = discussions geared for improving the core, discussing 
wordpress's future, discussing wordpress plugins, wordpress code (in 
general, or whatever) ... and discussing wordpress itself, because it's 
awesome like THAT.

But I'm not sure if a new list or a forum or what would be the best

+1 from here too. IMHO, there NEEDS to be a list where developers, 
coders, and plugin authors can discuss real issues/problems and then 
come up with fixes and such for those issues/problems without worrying 
about alot of chatter.

Find problems + discuss them + create fixes for those problems - chatter 
=  squashing them problems quicker ...

wp-hackers must die. It's been a waste of time and space for years;
no-one even seems to know exactly what it's *for*. And I don't just
mean the idiots asking for help breaking into MySpace accounts. There
are always people asking for help with plugins, for example, wondering
out loud if it's the right place, etc. Is it?

We've got wp-testers, wp-polyglots etc. already, but there's
definitely scope for, say, a plugin development list. Perhaps other
special interest groups: security, privacy, accessibility, theme
development? A wp-users list? A wp-core-development list? A limited
wp-cabal list is guaranteed to offend some people, unless there's a
quantifiable criterion for membership, but we'll get over it.

Some other projects have formal systems for proposing new features,
e.g. Python Enhancement Proposals, the LiveJournal suggestions
community. I don't see why ideas like "upgrade to PHP 5" can't be sent
off to <http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/> or some place like it. A
easily navigable archive might even discourage people from raising the
same issues over and over, especially if they're clearly marked as
"REJECTED". It isn't always easy to find the official position on
something.

Hmm, and there was such a tremendous response when Jacob Santos posted

Half the battle is finding issues. Coming up with new tests is
tangential to core and feature work, but is directly applicable to
shaking bugs out of nightlies, etc.

Besides, I have to know that automated tests exist to file failure bugs
against them. ;)

I'd say that the S/N ratio is so high because there are too many things
crammed into this list. IMHO, specific lists for specific topics would
help with improving focus. wp-users for user feedback and feature
suggestions; wp-support for OMG help; wp-devs for implementation
discussion; wp-plugin-devs for plugin help and ideas; and wp-testers
for all things test-related. But that's just my $.02 on the topic.


In any case, I guess it looks like I set my expectations wrong. I'll
keep an eye on this list, even though it's a little higher-traffic than
I generally keep in my inbox.


Thanks,

I think a better long-term approach would be to reinforce a culture on
wp-hackers such that "serious discussion that determines the future
direction of the WordPress codebase takes place here," as is its
stated purpose. [1]

One way to do that is to use the "stick": repeatedly ask flame-wars,
off-topic stuff, etc., to go elsewhere.

But another--at least as important--is the "carrot": bring the serious
discussion here.  This is part of the problem:

> two months which had heightened activity on wp-hackers
> had the lowest participation from any core developers, including myself.

I realized a while ago that many of the most important discussions
about the future of WP were happening elsewhere, because fairly
important changes would show up in trac without any prior wp-hackers
discussion (with the major exception of the new terms taxonomy).  I
could be wrong, but I don't believe there was any hackers discussion
about jQuery, PHPMailer, and canonical url redirection, for example,
prior to their appearing in trac.  And a few weeks ago, I learned from
an aside somewhere on trac that Happy Cog is redesigning the admin.
That seems like something that should have made an appearance on this
list.

So the list is what we make of it.  Take the important stuff away, and
you leave a vacuum to be filled with all the other junk.

I agree with above comments. It seems that most of the decisions
regarding Wordpress future are made by the guys from Automattic. If
people cannot involve in discussions on important decisions in the
Wordpress codebase, I think eventually Wordpress will become less
relevant. There are open source projects that suffer from the same
problem, usually controlled by a single company. They try very hard to
create a community, but the community has the feeling to not be taken
seriously because decisions are made by a few people and announced to
the community without the possibility to comment. A good example is
the Fedora project. In the beginning Red Hat had a hard time to build
a community, because they didn't involve the community in the
decisions they made.

I think it is important to involve the community (in this case
developers) in decisions made with regard to the future of Wordpress.
If you restrict the access to the hackers list, I think the step to
get involved in the development of Wordpress will become to hard for
new developers. Maybe now that is not a real problem (because there
are enough persons developing on Wordpress) but I think you will have
to attract new people to keep a project like this healthy. Maybe one
person can create summaries of discussions which makes it easier to
keep up to date for hackers that don't want to spend a lot of time
discussing. There are plenty of other project that suffer from this
problem and found a good solution without banning people who don't
contribute very much code wise, but have a useful opinion on topics.

great.

So, here's the technical explanation:

It had nothing to do with the User-Agent but with the HTTP request 
headers that were sent.  By default CLI utilities such as wget and curl 
dont send any Accept-Encoding headers.  Server side we were sending a 
'Content-Encoding: gzip' header for the tar.gz file.  Since there was no 
'Accept-Encoding: gzip' header sent by the client, an uncompressed 
version was delivered to the client.  It's pretty inconvenient (as you 
noticed) to have a tar.gz file that is uncompressed.

I have removed the Content-Encoding header and replaced it with the 
correct Content-Type headers to identify the different download types.

Ola there

On 3 of my blogs (either real or test blogs) I've upgraded to 1.3 and 
during upgrade.php?step=1 I've alwyas had notices like :

WordPress database error: [Duplicate entry '106-14' for key 1]
INSERT INTO wp_term_relationships (object_id, term_taxonomy_id) VALUES 
('106', '14')

WordPress database error: [Duplicate entry '106-14' for key 1]
INSERT INTO wp_term_relationships (object_id, term_taxonomy_id) VALUES

WordPress database error: [Duplicate entry '106-14' for key 1]
INSERT INTO wp_term_relationships (object_id, term_taxonomy_id) VALUES 
('106', '14')

Then, the usual message that upgrade is complete and I can click Continue. 
Nothing seems to be broken past this point, I don't seem to have lost any 
category or anything.

Any pointer of what I should check before upgrading ?

What's the cause and what's the effect?

I would say most serious movement happens in the bug tracker. That's not 
a bad thing, in fact it's great, and it became more pronounced after 
wp-hackers jumped the shark.

Trac is not best for discussion though -- there's no threading, it 
doesn't scale well (numbers wise), and it suffers from *some* of the 
same problems as wp-hackers, though not nearly as pronounced.

August and July were busy months on Trac, particularly August.

Still, if you look at the posts by devs to wp-hackers in July and 
August, the slow months, they propose serious topics or answer highly 
technical questions.

What would you have liked to have seen discussed on wp-hackers, and what 
would you have contributed?

This was also mentioned in at least two presentations at WordCamp, 
including the keynote, and I posted screenshots from one of their 
markups in June, which got a single response:

http://groups.google.com/group/wp-hackers/browse_thread/thread/53441d7fbdb2809c/b2adecb658c3a0f5?lnk=gst

Perhaps the misunderstanding is that you can contribute to WordPress 
development by posting to wp-hackers but not following the WP codebase 
(wp-svn), bugs and enhancements (trac), or any of the major news around 
the project (planet, WordCamp). It may be possible for one-offs, but not 
core functionality.

how do they manage to upload multiple files? is that all html and

Check out the source, it's Flash. I'd be very open to including 
something like this, especially since it could be made to gracefully 
degrade to current behaviour in the absence of Flash.

Sounds like a potentially serious bug.

better open a bug report at the trac site.

it's best if you have the of the blog database dump (from before the 
upgrade) ready to be handed to the developer in charge of this to allow 
easy reproduction of the bug.

(it's probably not the best idea to attach this to the ticket, it may 
contain sensitive information).

- From Ryan (on wp-testers):
- ----
Duplicate entry errors when inserting into the term_relationships
table should not cause any harm.  WP 2.2 did not enforce the post_id,
category_id relationship to be unique in the post2cat table.  That has
resulted in some people having multiple rows for the same post_id,
category_id pair in post2cat, as Alexander described.  The upgrade is
incorrectly assuming that the post2cat rows are unique.  This will
result in the db error messages but should not mess up your upgrade.
- ----

I believe this explains what you are seeing.

As someone on the fringe of all this - I use this list (and a feed  
from Trac) simply to watch what's going into releases. And that's  
because 'official' documentation is virtually non-existent.

But, as we are repeatedly told that the core should be light and the  
'frills' should be catered for by plugins, which is fine, it would be  
useful to have a dedicated 'plugin authors' forum where people can  
ask the more difficult techie questions they get stuck on and the  
more knowledgeable could assist the newbies. Doing that on this list  
sometimes works but just as often get's lost in the noise. I see  
other projects doing this successfully.

But you're right about this list. Far, far too many posts from a  
community who believe they can 'make' decisions that have already  
been made or influence change.

My 2 pennies worth.

Hi,

Thanks for the concern but I personally don't think it's a serious issue.

It's just a duplicate entry that got denied; something can actually be
ignored at times. However, I would like to know the developers' say on this
:)

Sincerely,

Sounds like a potentially serious bug.

better open a bug report at the trac site.

it's best if you have the of the blog database dump (from before the 
upgrade) ready to be handed to the developer in charge of this to allow 
easy reproduction of the bug.

(it's probably not the best idea to attach this to the ticket, it may 
contain sensitive information).

Bad example.  Those screenshots were in no way, shape or form, either
by you or the other contributors to the thread, labeled as part of a
back-end redesign.  I recall the thread; I also recall the screenshots
not existing at the time I went to view them and there being very
little follow-through on the thread, thus it didn't rise to the level
of "hey, something here is going into WP core!"

Matt:
I think you end up with a bit of a jaundiced view on this whole Open
Source thing if you start thinking along those lines.

Look at the reaction the phone-home feature got on Slashdot yesterday
as an example.  It was blown out of proportion because not enough
people were cognizant on the issues at hand or the thinking behind the
development.

I guess what I'm saying is that if you want to play in the bazaar and
not the cathedral, you need to be open to the hoi polloi every once in
a blue moon.

Thanks for this explanation westi (I'm not into wp-testers)

I was more or less suspecting something like this. I suggest that this 
kind of sql errors are hidden then, it might really scare the average 
user.

This is the type of sentence that is best followed by a phrase that  
starts with "such as," and then points to a number of other solutions  
that solve the problem.

Don't overlook the fact that most users do in fact have Flash installed.

With 940 people on the list, noise is guaranteed.

I support separation of the list into various topics. For example:
* wp-discussion: Anything WP related
* wp-plugins: Plugin developer chat
* wp-core: Specifically discussing the direction of core

Currently, there's no formal documentation of decisions made on the 
list. It would be a major step forward to formalise decisions and the 
decision making process.

G'day,

I realise there's been a lot of noise on this subject. Let's try to keep 
this thread short and on-topic. If you support my proposal, say so, if 
you don't, say so. No need for detailed reasons, I'm assuming they've 
already been explained elsewhere.

* Add an option to the Options > Privacy tab
* Option name "Updates"
* Option choice 1: "WordPress should check for updates automatically and 
send my blog url."
* Option choice 2: "WordPress should check for updates automatically but 
*not* send my blog url."
* Option choice 3: "WordPress should not check for updates."
* Then the text: "For more on how this information is used, see the 
Privacy Policy" - link to the policy online.

All those in favour say aye, etc... :)

Cheers - Callum.

I am against this, for the following reasons:

* One of the core design ideas for WordPress is that we don't introduce
options lightly.  The moment you think of making a feature optional you
challenge the argument for introducing the feature in the beginning.

* Plugin update notification is the number one requested feature from
the Ideas section of wordpress.org - The community has spoken and this
is something that they want.

* The core admin user interface should only contain options for things
that we expect the majority of our users to want to twiddle with. All
other optionality should be provided using the filter/hook system which
allows for advanced users to disable features they don't want.  This is
to ensure that you don't intimidate the naive user.

* If we want to provide the option for the tin-foil-hat privacy brigade
to hide there blog url in outgoing requests from WordPress then
implementing a centralised UserAgent generator ( as suggested here:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5065) with a filter to allow plugins to
remove parts of the UserAgent string as required is probably the correct
solution - this gives you a single hook with which to engage your
tin-foil-hat.  This ensures that your "private" data cannot leak out in
any direction be it wordpress.org / pingomatic / technorati etc.

Nay. Option choice 2 is stupid. Your URL is not private nor protected
information. The options should be check for updates or don't.

Now, if you don't want the blog url sent as part of that, then it
should be global, not an extra useless option.

the tin foil hat thing was funny the first time it was used.

now it's used to bash anyone with privacy concerns.

drop this shit, the fact that you don't care about your privacy and the
privacy of your users does not mean you are superior in any way.


please don't reply either.

Sensitive much?

I'm sorry, but when you consider public information (your URL) to be a
privacy concern, then yeah, you're in the tin-foil realm.

The "feature" at hand is uselessly sharing information that obviously quite
a few members of the community feel shouldn't be shared. It's not disabling
the *entire* feature -- Mark Jaquith proved, earlier, that update
notification works perfectly well with a fake URL. Also, they can just
disable it anyways with the two plugins John Blackbourn has released.

* Plugin update notification is the number one requested feature from

They wanted plugin update notification, this, in 2 out of 3 options, will
*keep* this.

Do the "majority of our users" (I'm assuming you mean the
not-so-technically-informed) know what Technorati, pingbacks, Ping-o-matic,
Google crawlers, and etc. mean? I'm banking on not. The privacy page already
has these, and it's not impossible to explain it.

That's a bit overboard, don't you think? That code isn't even in the SVN and
can be modified to not provide the URL, yet again, by an option, or failing
that, a plugin.

Flash, when used correctly, is a very nice solution, especially in terms of
cross-browser-ness. So I'd have to disagree with you. And it is possible to
make it degrade gracefully.

And, as Daniel says, a lot of users *do* have Flash installed -- it's pretty
commonplace these days.

I wouldn't like it. When something plugin is cool enough to be core,
when something discussed is cool enough to become a plugin or to
become core, or when something core is not cool enough so a plugin
polishing the feature is needed (example: tags as of now) it would
become over tedious branching and following the discussion onto
another mailing list.

I almost feel wp-hackers and wp-testers is an unneeded fork.

Personally when I'm fed up with a topic ("drop PHP4", "stop spying on
my public URL" etc) I just don't read the messages anymore, except
when from someone I find sensitive.

I do support however the decision documentation stuff, as Photomatt
started it a few weeks ago with what I believe was a project for a
developper FAQ.

+1 on this idea. Maybe people could be encouraged to post their "my wp 
isn't working" messages exclusively to wp-testers, too?

-1 on moving to a web-based forum. If discussion is in a web browser, 
I for one will not visit the site regularly and participate, but I do 
read my mailing list email at least daily.

Guys, please keep the responses to yes / no (and your reasons if you 
must). Let's avoid another endless thread responding to each other's 
reasons. I think the debate has raged long enough. Let's take stock of

Subject: [wp-hackers] Bug in wp_sanitize_redirect() on IIS ???
Message-ID: <46FA7067.2060600@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I haven't experienced this personally, but some users of my WP Mail 
SMTP[1] plugin have reported that the Options page redirection doesn't 
work properly under IIS. It seems to work fine on LAMP.

After clicking "Update Options" the options page redirects to this url:
wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-mail-smtp2Fwp_mail_smtp.php&updated=true

It seems the % is being stripped from the / in the URL. The correct url is:
wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-mail-smtp%2Fwp_mail_smtp.php&updated=true

It seems that this is being stripped out in the 
wp_sanitize_redirect()[2] function. I can't figure out why it's being 
re-introduced under Apache though. As far as I can tell the code strips 
out the % but doesn't add it back anywhere before redirecting.

Anyone got any ideas?

Cheers - Callum.

Splitting the list into topical lists won't help anyone. Topics of
discussion overlap too much for this to work. It will increase
cross-posting between lists. It will increase the chance that people
who aren't subscribed to every wp-* list will miss something.

People should be encouraged to post their "my wp isn't working"
messages to the support forums (which are linked at the bottom of
their WP installations for crying out loud), _not_ to the lists.

Flash has a bad reputation because people build entire websites out of it.

This sort of use of Flash is brilliant. It maintains the user's
familiar OS UI (unlike Mootools). I've had great success with
SWFUpload (http://swfupload.mammon.se/) in the past, and it degrades
nicely to users who don't have Flash.

What use is that? IMO debating is much more constructive rather than "yes!"
"no!" "yes!" "no!." Not encouraging discussion is a very dark road.

Firstly, the preg_replace character class in wp_santize_redirect starts
with a ^ and is therefore negated - we allow % in those urls so that
should not be stripping it out I believe.

Could it be an issue with the parse_url call in wp_safe_redirect?

What about creating topics within the one list?

An informal policy might be enough. Include it in the welcome message 
for the list. Prepend your subject line with the appropriate topic:
[security]
[plugins]
[core]
[discussion]

That would make it easier to filter out what you don't want to read but 
still give everyone access to all the info if they want it.

Cheers - Callum.

In what sense? Management of images and drag-and-drop is cumbersome,
but the uploader is fine (one file at a time though).

But "Option 2 is stupid"  is an accurate statement. It's giving people
the false impression that a) by sending their blog URL to the update
server it is somehow infringing their privacy, and b) that by _not_
sending it it somehow gives them some form of privacy.

Having this option will mislead users into thinking that by using it,
their requests to the update server will be anonymous when in fact,
they are not and cannot be.

That is pretty nice, but Flickr's new uploader is even more flickricious.

Aha, yes, good point. Damn those regular expressions, I've never managed 
to get my head round it. I see now, it strips all invalid characters.

Could it be this?
if ( $is_IIS ) {
         header("Refresh: 0;url=$location");

Something to do with the way IIS outputs that header? Anyone got an IIS 
box they could test it on? I don't...

Cheers - Callum.

I too think that segmenting is probably a bad idea. For an example,
just imagine if there was a wp-plugins list the kind of garbage that
will surface such as:

* Is there a plugin available to do $foo?
* Will someone write me a plugin to do $bar? I will send you $5USD via
Paypal - promise!
* $foobar plugin isn't working - please fix it!

I really think Austin was on the money with his suggestion to
"reinforce a culture" on the list. Have some guidelines for posting
that encourage healthy, fruitful discussion and discourage going
off-topic. With those guidelines in place, maybe folks wouldn't be so
timid to point a finger at someone when they do become disruptive or
stray OT. The discussion yesterday regarding Google/privacy is prime
example of a diatribe that went on way too long before someone called
them out on it.

Personally, I'm just thankful for the 'mute' option in Gmail. That
really helps keep the signal/noise ratio in check in my inbox.

Before deciding to fork the list into oblivion, keep in mind that in
democracies, politicians have a knack to debate special interest topics as
they get randomly lobbied for, and avant-guarde topics over and over until
they're no longer avant-guarde.

Each in their own way, the privacy issue raised recently, and the php5
debate that comes up every now and then, are characteristic.

That these and off-topic discussions occur on wp-hackers is really nothing
odd. It merely means the democratic environment you've set up is in good
overall health.

What this list could use is a bit more leadership. Devs and bug gardeners
could send invites to noteworthy tickets as they give them some love. The
relevant discussions would then occur on the tickets themselves -- where the
food for thought probably belongs anyway.

Many wp-hackers readers, I would guess, are less interested in proactively
debating how WP should evolve, than in knowing what upcoming releases will
change or break. The usefulness of this list would increase if it offered a
concise overview of what's cooking.

As one of the idiots who continued the Google thread yesterday, I completely
agree.  I was wrong to contribute to that thread, I admit.  But there's a
larger point.

Others have mentioned it in a variety of ways, and it's crucial distinction.
The moment that the direction of Wordpress is decided in an invitation-only
forum, is the moment it stops being what makes it great: an open, community
focused work of software art.

This forum could simply benefit from the kind of love the software itself
gets.  When the core code moves toward bloat or off the target Matt or
someone steps in and says "nope, take that to a plug-in".

Same goes here.  Just stop noise early.  And it's the community's
responsibility.  When a thread goes off-target, when the horse has been
beaten to death, anyone should feel free to guide it elsewhere.

And the core devs who feel the pain that Matt expresses, could ease their
pain by driving important topics to here, increasing the signal to noise
ratio.

Up the signal, drive down the noise, and the music starts sounding pretty
good.

The output of parse_url() isn't used in the redirect -- just for  
domain comparison purposes.  So no.

"Aye" for a two-option version.  Check for Updates/ Don't Check for  
Updates.

K.I.S.S.

Put a couple hooks into it so that if somebody _really_ wants to do  
it halfway, it can be done with a plugin.  Just my 2 cents.

I agree entirely. I can understand Matt's position as well. He spends
more time here than he should. It was about 2 years ago that I asked
if this mailing list could be turned to/replaced by a newsgroup. I
have not been posting here for months because it became hard (and
time-consuming) to keep up with. Mailing lists are almost worse than
online forums. And then there's the issue of forum-worthy posts coming
to a development mailing list...

I am not sure that would work... I belong to exactly one high-traffic 
list that manages to stay on target. There are a few factors that make 
it work:

a) Rather than community policing, there a few designated moderators 
(benevolent dictators) who "fling a wet noodle" when anything gets out 
of hand, and say the thread must stop. If someone else wants a thread 
stopped, they can ask a moderator to do it. People generally respect 
this and stop discussing the thread.

b) There are very strict list guidelines regarding what can and can't 
be discussed, which are written down, and a link to the list 
guidelines is at the bottom of each post.

c) In order to get a post through the mailing list software, one of 
the designated subject indicators must be in the subject line. For 
example, for the Hackers list, you could have subject lines like
    (plugin) Proposed plugin for better tag editing
    (core) Better tag editing needed in core of WP
etc. There are only 7 approved subject indicators in the other list 
I'm on. Posts that don't fit in one of those subject areas are outside 
the list. Also, people can subscribed to only a subset of the subject 
areas if desired.

d) There is a separate list called "NWR" (not web related -- this 
particular list is for discussion of web-related topics) for people 
who want to participate in off-topic discussions with like-minded people.

I think something like this could work on wp-hackers, and would 
improve the list greatly. It would take a little work to write the 
list guidelines, but I think the list software on wp-hackers already 
supports topical subject header filtering.

As my mother-in-law would say: "You've been reading my mail."

I think that what is being lost in this discussion is that what makes
WordPress great ISN'T just the code, but the code + the community.
Would WP see the usage that it does, sans a vibrant aftermarket in
plugins and themes?  I'd wager not.

The idea is to foster community wherever possible, and segmented/gated
portions of the community are definitely not the way to go. They breed
resentment, suspicion and an aura of distrust of the gatekeepers.

So, that being said, if everyone's amenable (and it only works if they
are), I think we ought to look to sanction a couple of
Gatekeeper/Keymasters, folks who would work not just under the
auspices of the community but also have some manner of official
recognition from the official documentation.  Elections?  Appointments
from on high?  What say you?

Maybe we institute terms -- say, 6-8 months at max, rotating through,
so that there's less burnout for the G/K and so they don't get a
little dictator's schwerve on...

Thoughts?

I'd support a simple two-option approach if we add "User-Agent" as an 
option that can be edited from /wp-admin/options.php. It doesn't need to 
appear in any of the other screens, but it doesn't require a plugin to 
edit if a user wants to change it.

Does that sound like a reasonable compromise? - Callum.

It works both ways.  That's what I had in mind in talking about the
"culture" of wp-hackers.  The lead devs are understandably annoyed by
the noise, but if they leave to make their decisions in private
instead of helping to maintain the quality of the discussion, I think
the WP community at large--not just wp-hackers--will be worse for it.

Those examples actually align with my point, which is that the
decision-making has often been occurring somewhere other than
wp-hackers, with its results showing up in trac.  The hackers thread
you cite started almost two months after the jQuery trac ticket
announced that we were converting, so obviously the decision had
already been made.

> What would you have liked to have seen discussed on wp-hackers, and what
> would you have contributed?

I'm not complaining about the outcome of this particular decision.  I
really like jQuery, which is why I've helped to move some of the admin
code to it from Prototype/Scriptaculous.  However, what I would have
liked to have seen is a discussion about the relative merits of the
different libraries.

It's possible that someone could have made a strong argument for
including another library, but we as a community never had the
opportunity to weigh the options and come to a consensus.  Even if
consensus in this hypothetical discussion was impossible, and a lead
developer had to break the stalemate, at least everything would have
been conducted in the open and the reasons understood (if disagreed
with).

I am pretty faithful about at least scanning all the list posts, trac
tickets, and major affiliated blogs.  That's how I ran across a random
trac comment about the new admin UI shortly after WordCamp.  So I
googled it and found nothing, not even at the Happy Cog site or
Photomatt.  Now, a few weeks later, googling turns up a few blog
entries, but still not many details.  Not everyone with a serious
interest in WordPress was able to attend WordCamp, so in my opinion
something of this importance should have been at least mentioned on
one of the lists.

Joe Average isn't going to have any clue what that means.

That's why I suggested hooks -- exactly the kind of thing that should  
be a plugin.  If I want to send it with modified User-Agent, I can  
install the (most likely soon-to-be-programmed) "Custom User-Agent"  
plugin, and then turn "Check Updates" back on in WP Options.

Don't confuse/intimidate-with-complexity the non-technical bloggers.

Regards,

Stephen

If this is representative of the attitudes of the core contributors,

Best to document this /now/ very loudly so those who are not spending
X hr/day pounding these channels, but who want to keep up with what is
going on can unsub from a channel that has "jumped the shark" and is
just generating noise.

Generally, this would be a value-add.  But should it take a test-drive
as a plug-in for a few months?

I created the start of a patch at:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5065

Can you help me out with the hooks?  I pushed all the User-Agent
strings into a single function, wp_user_agent().

Now I need hooks so that a plugin can modify the User-Agent (empty
user agents are problematic).

Pointers, examples or suggestions are desired.

Ciao!

Impossible really.

You can't easily AFAIK tell the difference between checkout and update
from the server side.

All you might be able to do is to distinguish how many unique IPs use svn

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP package with spam plugin
Message-ID: <1190834937.19622.59.camel@localhost>

Hi,

before I explain, a little question: What would you do, if WordPress
distributed a WordPress version including a plugin for, say,
TextLinkAds? Would you say this is ok, or would you consider it spam?

There is a German WordPress (WPD) community who translates WP to German
and who power support forums. This is very nice, however nothing
special.

They also distribute the German WP version, which has everything German
(even themes and early messages). Therefore their version is quite
widespread among the German speaking WP community.

Now WPD distributes a WordPress 2.3 package together with a plugin for
the usage of LinkLift, a German link trade platform similar to
TextLinkAds. The plugin is not activated by default, and one needs an
account with LinkLift to use it, but pretty obviously, this is plain
spam: Including a plugin in a core distribution suggests that this
plugin is very important and useful, and even the inclusion itself is
good for transporting the name of the company to a very relevant target
audience.

What WPD does is not illegal, anyway, many German users are rather upset
about this advertising, especially as WPD makes money by including
advertising into a product that they didn't create. (Btw, remember that
Automattic doesn't make advertising on the wp.org forums, not even on
wp.com.)

Now some of the less savvy German WP users think that this is WordPress
in general coming with advertising since 2.3, and some of the half savvy
*and* paranoid even believe that there's a connection between the new
update notification in WP 2.3 and the advertising in WPD's 2.3. This of
course is very bad PR for WordPress.

Asked about this plugin being in the WPD's WordPress package, the WPD
team refuses to give any concrete answers (for the German speaking:
http://forum.wordpress-deutschland.org/feedback-und-ankuendigungen/25428-offene-anfrage-wordpress-deutschland-4.html)
But it is obvious that there is some sort of deal between WPD and
LinkLift.

Now I wonder: Do you guys agree that including a commercial plugin into
a WordPress package is spam? If so, what could be done about it?

Kind regards,
Alex

Sorry for the long delay.
This ticket covers WP handling it, but since add_post_meta doesnt have
any hooks/filters it doesnt allow a plugin to step in and do anything
about it.
Also that diff only covers mw_newPost() and fails to cover mw_editPost()

I think that the diff in the ticket, and adding that to mw_editPost(),
plus my do_actions would all be good things. They can go together just fine

Is the plugin GPL'd?

If Matt (who holds the WP trademark, I believe) felt that this was a
violation of the WP TM, I believe he could demand that they quit using
"WordPress" to advertise themselves and that they cease using
trademarked names and images.

IANALBIPOOTV, of course.

As you yourself stated: spam and illegal are two different things...

IT's like sponsored themes - it's unethical, but not illegal... I don't think there's anything you can do except distribute your own spam-free package?

It's open source.  There isn't much you can do.  The Tradmark idea has
merit; though it is dangerous emotionally to users and supporters.

**However**

Since it is open source, WP.org can take the German version, merge it
into SVN and release it shortly after the English one.  The German one
may not come out until WPD does the translation, but there is nothing
stopping WP.org from having an official German version making it clear
that WP.org doesn't approve of including a spam plugin.

No, it's another useless option.

I support the idea of unifying the user agent sent by WP on all HTTP
requests. There's something in trac to that effect, I think it's a
good idea.

Of course, I also support running said user agent through a filter, to
allow modification by plugins.

I don't support adding any sort of tinfoil options by default though.
Now, I *would* support such an option if it actually enhanced privacy.
However, it does not. Your website is sending the request to another
website. That means it's sending information on the internet. That
means it's sending along it's IP address. And that means that tracing
the request back to the original site that it came from is a fairly
trivial exercise.

Whether your website tells who it is or not, it can still be traced
back. Even if you use a shared host, it can be worked out without too
much difficulty.

This sounds like the best solution to me.  This also has the benefit  
of standardizing our user agents so that changes to them are  
reflected across the board.  All this talk about multiple options for  
this is getting sort of crazy.

It's been said at least twice before: please cease the derogatory
"tinfoil" appellation.  It does nothing to increase your position and
merely serves to denigrate others.

No, it's a statement of position, not intended to "denigrate" other
people's opinions. I've pointed out (also twice) why, exactly,
removing the data is not a valid privacy concern.

As such, thanks for the suggestion, but I'll continue to have, and
express, my own opinions as I see fit.

And odds are, nobody will dismiss them as "stupid" or "useless".  It'd be
nice if you stopped doing that as well.

In light of the recent "signal to noise" discussion regarding the  
future of this list, will you two please STOP or take it offlist?   
This serves nothing.

Unless you're the List Mom, this kind of reaction tends to exacerbate the
problem.

I think you're great and this is not a ding on you, but it illustrates that
without a List Mom *everybody* who cares about the health of a forum feels
compelled to play that role.  This makes everybody nervous, and a healthy
list can't work that that way for long.

I've heard some people discussion cordoning off core developers into their
own area.  In my experience[1], popular lists can be managed without
segmenting people into n00bs and l33ts.  After all, today's n00bs are
tomorrow's l33ts, and n00bs are good at identifying issues that l33ts can
take for granted.

In my experience the best way to keep list quality high is through example
and peer-pressure, based on clear and consistent guidance/feedback from a
List Mom.

-- Charles

P.S.  I think I only ever banned one person, and that was because he
threatened my life and Apple security got involved.  I think this list is at
least a few days from that point.   :O)

[1] I was the List Mom of a couple a Apple lists with a few thousand
subscribers each for a few years.

That's a very succinct way to put it.

I'd support a plugin that replaces the URL with some known format 
because I think that would be a useful metric to track as well. We could 
use the popularity of that format to decide whether it warrants a core 
option.

Thanks Charles, I completely agree.
A "List Mom" as a third party would be able to guide the n00bs and
discourage the inappropriate poster since the guidance from the lead
developers or active subscribers are *somehow* taken personal or perceived
as condescending, which burns their flames.

You have my vote, if you can handle a bunch of maczealets then you can
handle us...maybe. Although I would suggest the "Mom" to be anonymous.

I've already put in the submission for the "tinfoil hat" plugin; the
name being tongue-in-cheek of course. ;)

URL sent would be configurable, but I'm happy to have it default to a
known string (probably just the root of my domain). I'll get cracking
on some code.

I am a web consultant who has recently become a WP evangelist of sorts, 
using WP for clients who need a small-scale CMS.  So I am really 
interested in the direction of WordPress, without being
personally involved in the coding.

My real desire is for a mailing list (not a forum) where I can make note
of what I don't like, praise features I do like, look for someone to
help w/ plugin issues, offer help to other users, but maybe more
conceptual and community-oriented than the wordpress.org forums.

At first, due to the name "wp-hackers," I thought that's what this list
was.  But even though it isn't, I've stayed, because I am very
interested in the direction that WP is taking.  (Very exciting to me to 
hear about HappyCog involvement...)

Regardless, I do agree that the list is so large, it really needs some 
guidelines and gentle moderation, and maybe indeed a list for core 
developers that is more narrowly and strictly focused.

IMO this is a natural growing pain for WP community...

In any case...  +1 on list-mom.

As I stated on the ticket, I don't think either of the update checks should
be able to be disabled via the admin interface. It's too big of a security
risk. For those who really need to disable it, a plugin should have to do
the job. Stops the noobs from disabling it.

However, I full heartedly agree that it wouldn't hurt to cater to the tin
foil hatters out there by having a "Don't send blog statistics when checking
for updates" box.

Well, traffic on this thread seems to have died down a bit, but I'm
hoping the contest / challenge is still alive (Matt, let me know),
because I'm submitting our Mobile Admin plugin:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mobileadmin/

See page for details and screenshots.

Here are the basic highlights / supported features:
* Dashboard sections: Incoming Links, Comments, Posts, Blog Stats
* Writing and editing posts
* Tagging support in 2.3
* Comment Moderation
* Manage Posts page
* Manage Profile page
* Ability to toggle back and forth to the normal admin view.
* Support for plugin includes on post page

This initial release is specifically targeted at the iPhone, but the
goal is to eventually add support for other mobile devices as well,
using a stripped down core set of features and then adding
capabilities and fancy styling on a per user-agent basis, using a
plugin type architecture for each new device to be supported.

We'd really appreciate any feedback on it, especially if any of you
lucky iPhone owners out there would like to try it out and let us know
how it works for you. There are support forums and our trac instance
linked from the main page above

I've written such a plugin, which I'm calling my Tinfoil-hat
plugin.[1] (Travis Snoozy, I know you just said you were thinking of
that name, but I had chosen it long before you said anything. Sorry.)

The plugin hashes the URL and does some other tinfoil-hat-ish things,
which I mention on the plugin's page.

Also:
- It uses Snoopy if fsockopen isn't available.
- It allows you to tell the plugin-update notification not to remind
you again for a week.

Obviously I haven't had much time to test it, so I'd appreciate all
feedback anyone wants to provide.

Proper etiquette (according to the Codex) for multiple plugin files is to
have _all_ files inside the plugin's folder, i.e. like this:

/wp-content/plugins/MobileAdmin/MobileAdmin.php
/wp-content/plugins/MobileAdmin/iphone.js
/wp-content/plugins/MobileAdmin/iphone.css
etc.

Keeps the clutter down. ;)

Anyway, well done! We definitely have some competition going, hehe.

Ah, that's good to know. I'll fix that.

It was good to see that you guys are still working on it as well. I
wasn't sure, but I figured releasing ours was a good way to find out.

I look forward to checking out what you guys have been doing too.

Here's to a better iPhone  WP admin experience for everyone, however
it might play out!

Actually, before I do that, it would seem to contradict this statement
on the Extend FAQ [1]:
"If you have complicated plugin with lots of files, you can of course
organize them into subdirectories, but the readme file and the root
plugin file should go straight into trunk/."

That makes me hesitant to move the root plugin file into a subfolder,
especially since extend pulls some data out of that file to generate
the page.

Can anyone more familiar with the inner workings of extend lend some
insight on this?

Thanks,
Jared

I guess I could just throw everything that's currently in the
subfolder out into trunk, and then the extend system will generate one
directory containing all the files for cleaner installation purposes.
Perhaps that would be the best way to achieve the desired result...

Sorry, talking to myself...

When the plugin is packaged, its files are automatically placed in
a subdirectory.  In other words, files in

    http://svn.wp-plugins.org/mobileadmin/tags/1.0.10/

will magically be in a directory called "mobileadmin" when unzipped.

Or so I've let myself understand.  :)

Yes, the WP.org directory already sticks all your files in a folder matching
the stub name of your plugin at WP.org. No need to stick them in a subfolder
on /trunk/.

Looking good guys. Looking good. :)

Haven't had time to check your src yet. But I'm curious to see how  
you tackled some of the issues we were faced with.
I see it's iPhone only for v1. Have you put a lot of thought into the  
constraints of other mobile devices?

Good work.

Stephane

Yes, but we kind of fast-tracked towards the iPhone only for this
round. I'm starting on a slight refactoring tonight that will get us
back to our original plan of encapsulating user-agent specific
features into their own files and away from the "main" plugin code.

The basic idea we're going for is to detect any mobile device we can
(by user agent), and give them a stripped down version of the admin UI
suitable for use on mobile devices.

The plugin will send an extremely simple UI (probably no script or
CSS) to generic mobile devices, and then use a "plugin" structure to
alter (add features) to specific user agents that are known to be
capable of more, with the iPhone being the first.

I have to say that it's cool to know that this "race" (if you want to
call it that) is being run with such good natured guys; it reflects
well on the WP community, and makes me thankful for this list. Sure,
there are some out of control topics every now and then, but overall I
think it's a great asset.

That's pretty clever (the plugin method). I hadn't thought of that.

I'm filtering / hooking / translating everything possible for our plugin,
but that is a clever solution. I may just have to rip that off after we
release our 1.0 and move on to sharing ideas and such (i.e. post
competition). ;)

All in good fun indeed. The way I see it, it's a win-win situation.
Regardless of the outcome, we all end up with a ton of experience we  
can reuse professionally.
But there is a part of me that's a bit worried that we're just  
duplicating our efforts.
The two sides of the coin that is competition. :)

Well, I already applied for the name by the time I'd sent that mail.
I'll change it if I don't get the spot on wp-plugins, but I'm loathe
to go through and change 10s or 100s of names at this point unless
absolutely necessary. :)

For the time being, this cuts out all potentially-sensitive data
(language, PHP version, charset preferences) and allows spoofing of
the URL. I'll probably add the switches for each of the other sensitive
items tomorrow, and a pre-2.3 cutout for all the update options (I'm
sure there's some tinfoil I can apply to prior versions, too ;). I've
verified that the cut-outs work, the replacements correctly spoof, and
all the form fields save properly and work right.

The code's temporary home is at http://remstate.com/tinfoil-hat/

Stop giving away our secrets, jk.

Yes, the WP.org directory already sticks all your files in a folder matching
the stub name of your plugin at WP.org. No need to stick them in a subfolder
on /trunk/

There are definitely trade offs for throwing everything into the trunk, one
major problem is Viper's first comment which is clutter, I'd imagine the
majority of people would just throw the entire directory in their
wp-content/plugin folder without taking out the unnecessary files, i.e.
screenshots and readme.txt. But then again, if they were to make that
mistake the plugin would break if we kept it the way it is.

Maybe we instead of throwing everything into the trunk we change the name of
that subdirectory.

It would make it a lot easier if we just all got iPhones :) for a merged
project; that would be a win:win:win.

Ah, if Automattic wasmade out of money.
Then they'd still be coding and bringing us cool stuff to play with

I have a similar conundrum, in that I'm trying to figure if I want to 
use WordPress for more than a blog platform. At this moment, I've 
developed using the Zend Framework and think that perhaps, what it 
solves is not for everything. My work uses WordPress a great deal, so 
anything that would make my life easier, developing with WordPress would 
make me happier.

I advocate PHP5 and OOP, but only because it makes my life easier. 
Having to deal with legacy code when building new web applications 
shouldn't even be considered. However, stepping back from a developers 
role, it makes sense to support PHP4 at the moment, because not everyone 
can afford a host that obviously doesn't suck (no fsockopen. What?).

My role in bringing it up was only to point out that the future should 
be part of the focus. Looking only to the past does very little good in 
development. I wouldn't say the argument that I bought up was about 
switching to PHP5. If someone like me (and I am someone like me) wants 
to do it, then okay, that is their battle. However, it would require a 
lot of work.

I agree that the name and lack of description as to what this list is 
for on the WordPress mailing lists list doesn't help the matter. 
Generally, I would say it would go a long way to copy and paste what 
someone said previously this list was for and place it where everyone 
subscribing can see. That way, someone like me doesn't generalize this 
list as something it is not.

Anyway, I think that perhaps I'm growing bored of this list and 
WordPress. I doubt I'll be part of the community much longer, so you can 
count this "contributor" and pundit out in the near future.

I think having everything in the trunk is the best way to go. When
they get the generated download file it will be packaged into a
directory that we can instruct them to just move into their plugins
directory - easiest possible route and it would work fine with the
least amount of explanation or hand holding.

If we're worrying that they'll copy out of that directory and directly
into the plugins dir, (1) it would still work fine and (2) we'd have
that concern no matter how deep the folder structure might be.

If they really need to save a few KB they can delete the screenshot
images, etc. but leaving them in won't hurt anything and they also
won't get in the way if they are neatly packaged under a subdirectory.

My vote is that we do as described above. Hopefully you'll vote for it
too, because since we're a two person team we'll have a deadlock if
you don't. :)

PS - Matt, just think, only two iPhones instead of three... :)

Huge -1 to that, mainly the PHP version. I'm fine with plugins
disabling sending that, but if we don't send that with the core, then
that's a lot of very important statistics lost (i.e. if we only
support PHP5, what % of users would be affected?).

And what's the harm in sending PHP version anyway? You're REALLY
paranoid if you think that's a security risk and if for some reason it
is, then you have bigger problems (i.e. upgrade your PHP version).

Huh, what's the problem with throwing everything in trunk? For
example, I have one of my plugins located in "trunk":

http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/vipers-video-quicktags/trunk

When you download it:

http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/vipers-video-quicktags.zip

It's already located in a folder called "vipers-video-quicktags"
(thanks to the packager) which you upload entirely to your plugins
folder. The screenshots, readme, and everything else nicely end up in
the plugin's folder. What's the drawback of that?

Currently, with this MobileAdmin plugin, you have to browse into the
"mobileadmin" folder, then selectively upload the MobileAdmin.php file
as well as the "MobileAdmin" folder.

Seems rather messy and time consuming to me.

    In my experience, it's better to have the List Mom be clearly 
identified as such, not anonymous.  When you have anonymous or even 
semi-anonymous Mommery, there are inevitably cries of "secret cabal" 
and even worse.  Some of this likely comes from the the inability to 
appeal or plead one's case.  And anyway, it's hard to be a Mom 
without showing your face once in a while.

And that would be grossly inaccurate also. I personally maintain about
15 blogs that are  hosted on one server.

But, I guess 'x + 1' is closer to 'x + 15' than 'x' is.

Meh. It's just as accurate as counting number of file downloads would
be. After all, you could download the file once and then use it to
update 15 different sites...

What with the update checker code there, you could get really accurate
counts now by simply counting the number of requests being made on
api.wordpress.org.

For some reason I misinterpreted what you originally said. I agree with the
structure that you've laid out, we'd just have to change that subdirectory
name and change the some paths in our plugin. That's not a problem IMO, I
thought you suggested something completely different, which will remain
nameless.

Like Jared said, it would help us from hand holding since people clearly
don't read instructions.

Thanks...now back to work for the major improvements in 1.1.

I don't think it's worth blocking PHP version, since the PHP version
is sent with every HTTP response on the blog.

BTW: A bunch of this is done already in bugs 5065 and 5085.

I'm not concerned with the affect on statistics. I'm concerned with
providing full information control for the user. It is conceivable that
someone, somewhere, does NOT want to send their blog URL and PHP
version, or even IP and PHP version. I can't make that call for someone
else's environment.

There *is* another interesting statistic that falls out: the rough
proportion of people who leave updates on, but don't feel comfortable
sending PHP or other information (real security issue or not). How
people feel about that data being collected should be a big player in
whether you actually collect it. Forcing it down throats because "OMG
we need the statistics!" is not conducive to building a sense of trust.

Now, that said, I do intend to put excerpts into the config info that
outlines what the data *could* be used to good effect for. Most of it
is pretty straightforward:

PHP version -- the service *could* provide a warning if the next
WordPress release isn't compatible with your PHP version (though that
could be performed very simply as a local check, too). I don't think
that PHP version has much other relevance for the user.

Language -- the service *could* return an appropriately-localized
message (though the displayed message is actually in the WP code
itself; it might send a URL to an appropriately-localized page). I don't
know what other benefit this would have for the user.

Charset -- The service *could* return a message in an appropriate
charset for the user's site (pretty similar to Language).

Blog URL -- Let's WP gather more useful stats about individual blog
installations, hopefully allowing for better software development in
the future. No direct benefit within the context of the service, as of
yet.


All that said, if there's some -real- desperation to get blog URLs,
they'll be sent by most browsers in the referer if people actually
*use* the "update" link. That's probably a better success-tracking
metric than anything, anyway: we had X visits to the site, Y "unique
seeming" visits (cut dup IPs and dup referers), and Z% of the remaining
hits appear to be coming from the dashboard of a WP installation.

+1 for a clean response.

I'll be sure to include that information in the options ("Most
configurations send this information with each page anyway. Unless
you're running in a special environment that doesn't do this...").
It'll be set to send by default.

Filtering user-agent strings will be nice, but the fact is that 2.3 is
out like this, and so the way it is now has to be supported for
some indeterminate time to come. :/

http://www.plymouth.edu/library/search/history

This search returns a mix of pages and posts (i.e. no catalog content):
http://www.plymouth.edu/library/search/history&scope=blog

All results are shown relevance ranked; relevance ranking and the  
faceted searching are supported by my plugins. The intermingling of  
all these content types in a single list is one of the most praised  
features, especially in the first example. Whatever happens in core,  
I'd like to preserve the ability to get this sort of combined result  
list.

Related: As I was trying to integrate pages in the search, the most  
important thing I found is that the automatically generated excerpts  
for pages are usually pretty bad. I ended up adding the excerpt field  
to the page editor so folks could write their own excerpts (though  
you'll also see my plugin is automatically inserting a list of  
sections of the page in the excerpt in some/many of these examples).

Colophon: The site has over 330,000 items in $wpdb->posts, including  
about 150 Pages. Scriblio and bSuite Core are the two major plugins  
that make that site work (both are broken in 2.3, I'm working on that).

I've been waiting for this conversation since I started following the list.

> "see what people expect"

The majority of people expect for pages to show up in their results and a
large majority of them want more options. My original release for SE was
very basic, option to include pages and an option to include comments. I
never liked searching comments (since the queries would take too long) but I
added it because that's what people wanted. Now, I'm not advocating that we
"bloat" the core with a ton of options but if we were to allow for searching
of pages it should be an option. And if it's an option we might as well add
some more functionality/options to give the masses what they want or at
least fill up the new search options page :) .

> see what plugins are doing

Currently SE has category exclusion, post and page id exclusion and the
searching of excerpts, comments, excerpts, drafts, attachments, meta data
(this is huge for a lot of users) and tags (broken in 2.3). All of these
options, except tags and drafts, have been strongly expressed by the
community as "necessary" options, especially those who use Wordpress as a
CMS for development.

I also strongly believe search functionality should not be considered as
bloat aside from the most obvious unnecessary options, i.e. tags and drafts.

Honestly, I would love to see the core make my plugin obsolete; my traffic
would suffer tremendously but the great thing about that, I would be more
inclined to make something innovative or resourceful instead of a
maintaining a plugin that "fixes" what's left out of core.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Looking for more XML-RPC developers
Message-ID: <6A4EB172-FEAB-4273-9CE2-232752B2D5CA@randomnetworks.com>


Lately I've been doing work on the XML-RPC code in WordPress.  But  
this has put the xmlrpc.php code into something of an island, so I'm  
here to recruite for some additional developers that would be willing  
to work on this code as well.  Some more eyes on the tickets/patches  
and code in general would be really helpful.  Especially if you catch  
something that I screwed up :-)

There are some clean up and breakage issues with the code and new  
features that need to be added to in effort to expose more of the  
core WP features.

A list was started recently (http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/ 
listinfo/wp-xmlrpc) to work with others (some of the client  
developers are on the list) that make use of WP XML-RPC.  If any of  
the above items are an interesting to you please feel free to sign up  
for the wp-xmlrpc list and introduce yourself and what you'd be  
interested in working on.

Thanks.

Yes,
What people expect -
A Search box should search BOTH pages and posts - visitors/Signed in 
users don't distinguish between these, they just see content in their 
browser and expect a search to find it!

Message-ID: <20070928070306.GU449@kimmo.suominen.com>

Hi!

I have a comment from 2007-03-03 with a good IP address logged:

    2001:14b8:1ee:0:211:11ff:fe98:edf1

But on another comment from 2007-09-13 I have this:

    20011481021111981

It appears to be the same address (my workstation), but with all
the colons and non-digit characters removed.

It seems this has already been reported on trac:

    #4579: IPv6 IPs
    #3987: IPv6 support

The culprit appears to be in changeset 3990:

    http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3990

I think the changes made to wp-includes/comment.php should just
be reversed.  The data in $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] is filled in by
the web server using information from the socket structure, so it
seems to me there is little need to further "sanitize" it.

I've attached a patch to ticket #4579 to revert the change.

The change in wp-includes/functions.php is fine, since Spamhaus
does not support IPv6.  It might be good to check for the case
that $ipnum has become empty after calling preg_replace().

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

I think the best solution here would be to move the checks to a
sanitization function and allow plugins to override it.

We could then add IPv6 support to the santization function (or to start
with it could be provided by a plugin)

I disagree.

Sanitizing should be done by the core, and should be done correctly.

this is tricky and order of the action matters a lot.

I think relying on plugins for it will only create confusion among
users, and possibly security holes.

There is a suggested function in ticket #3262, although it doesn't
have a hook.

Another possible problem with it seems to be possible regression
with regard to ticket #1738, since the suggested function in #3262
removes space and comma from the allowed characters.  Apparently
REMOTE_ADDR can be a list of addresses.

I wonder what the semantics with the list of addresses is.  How can
the remote (or local, for that matter) end of a TCP or other socket
connection be more than one (IP) address?

I understand how HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR can be a comma separated list,
but not REMOTE_ADDR.  However, it doesn't look like WordPress uses
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR at all (at least 2.3).

It was too much work to keep it working after every update from the official WP repo, it kept breaking big-time.

If anyone is interested in a PGSQL "port", we discussed this several on here and came to the conclusion that the most viable thing is a plugin that intercepts any calls to the database and uses some regex/mapping voodoo to convert MySQL commands to PostgreSQL commands.

There was a plugin that did that for WP 1.x and it worked just fine..

BTW, am I the only one that has issues with WP calling the ANCIENT, dead, VULNERABLE, and discontinued wordpress-pg.sourceforge.net an "excellent" WordPress port to the PGSQL platform?

I find that misleading. If the intention is to make it look like WP has PGSQL support... well, it doesn't and that line should be removed... Even the link to the pg port seeing as it is only version 1.2.1 WITH the security vulnrerabilities..... and hasn't been updated for years.

According to the CGI spec, REMOTE_ADDR is the IP address of the
remote host making the request.  In other words, it is just one
address, not a list.

i have code that does the "voodoo" for 2.3 and the previous 2.x
version. i have no code to migrate from mysql to pgsql though, so you
will have to start with a blank.

my module is for a PHP without mysql-support and it implements all
mysql_* calls. but if anyone wants to take up the task to create a
plugin, i am glad to hand it over.

i call BS. as is explained below, you found it in "theory". it was

if a litte regex-voodoo can do the trick, i wouldn't call it "serious
code changes". actually most query-rewrites for pgsql would still work
for mysql as well.

furthermore, if the schema can be overhauled like it was in 2.3 i
don't see why it can't be overhauled for a litte portability.

while we are at it:

is there anyone who can explain why there are about 6 integer types in
the schema?
 - bigint(10)
 - bigint(20)
 - tinyint(1)
 - int(11)
 - int(4)
 - unsigned

Can you please forward me that code? I'm not exactly sure what the code does, but I'll be happy to take a look at it and see what can be done :)

BIGINT may be necessary to support larger sequences/auto-increments,
and TINYINT(1) IIRC is a boolean flag.  Other than that, it's another
baby step towards MySQL lock-in (^:

I'm not SURE, but I think one of the guys that work on MySQL told me that using tinyint isn't any different space and performance wise than a int - it's only there as a usage constraint but it takes up the same amount of space on disk.... 

More importantly, there is no difference between int(x) and int(y) since that only affects how things are *displayed* rather than the actual length that is *stored* (verses string/text fields) and same goes for bigint(x) and bigint(y)...

Here's the manual for the latter statement: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/numeric-types.html

Now as for bigint..... 
The biggest number you can store in a bigint is 9223372036854775807 and unsigned is 18446744073709551615

Why would you EVER need such a big number? int()'s biggest is 4294967295 or 4.2 billion..... The biggest auto-increment I can think of is comment indexes, but still, that's HUGE......

this can be solved easily by replacing all occurences in schema.php
with a $-version like:
"
CREATE TABLE crap (
id int not null auto_increment,
comment_karma $mediumint,
comment_text     $longtext,
...
)
"

for mysql :
  $mediumint = 'mediumint';
  $longtext = 'longtext';

and for pgsql:
 $mediumint = 'int';
 $longtext = 'text';

and for mssql:
  $  yadayadayada...


anyways, i have my mysql2pgsql.php module attached.

Oops... I just saved my changes too >.< (had the edit page open for a while).

I've clarified some of the text regarding port vs. integration, but I'm wondering about adding a section on screwing abstracted DB access and sticking to ANSI SQL....
It's really not /that/ big of a jump and it'd be the easiest option......

Bad Dan, indeed! No, not *that* kind of plumbing emergency. That would

640K should be enough for anybody.

Really? I bet some incredibly popular WP sites have that many comments.

Pages should definitely be in search.  There are back-compat problems
with mixing pages and posts in the search results, however, which is
what most if not all search plugins do.  Some themes display the
entire post content in searches.  Pages with forms and other stuff in
them will make search results look screwy.  I think we'll need to add
a means for themes to signal they are compatible with mixed search
results.  Perhaps something like set_theme_capability('full_search',
true) that can be called from the theme's functions.php.  If the
capability is not true, we either exclude non-posts from the search
results or filter the content of non-posts in the results.

As for what all should be searched by default, posts and pages are
definitely in.  Perhaps comments and meta too.  Sites with a huge
number of comments could get bogged down, however.  I think  a good
starting point for a patch in core would include posts and pages and
make it easy to plug other things in.

Making our SQL more portable and making bits of the schema pluggable
is cool.  We have some tickets in trac about eliminating enums,
sanitizing ints, and such.  Patches welcome.  Tested patches that
upgrade cleanly from previous releases are even more welcome. :-)

Is there an easy way to know in which version of WP a particular
feature was introduced? Like, attribute_escape() was added in.. 2.0 ?
2.1 ? I think it would sometimes help to determine which lowest
version is compatible with a plugin.

Ditto.

Although what'd be _really_ cool is if you could paste the contents of your
plugin into a form and it'd parse the PHP, find all the functions, and
figure out the lowest compatible version. That'd be crazy awesome.

I've been thinking about this for the past half hour or so and I actually
think it'd be a lot, lot easier than I had previously thought. Infact, I
think I might actually be able to pull it off!

It'll have to wait for our iPhone submission to be completed as well as some
paid work though.

Heya,

Before I open a ticket for nothing, am I mistaken or is there a small  
bug in /wp-admin/post-new.php?

Code:
$nag_posts = array(
	array(
		'my_drafts',
		__('Your Drafts:'),
		'edit.php?post_status=draft&amp;author=' . $user_ID,
		count($my_drafts)),
	array(
		'pending',
		__('Pending Review:'),
		'edit.php?post_status=pending',
		count($pending)),
	array(
		'others_drafts',
		__('Others&#8217; Drafts:'),
		'edit.php?post_status=draft&author=-' . $user_ID,
		count($others_drafts))
	);

Should the "others_drafts" case really have the $user_ID reference in  
the "more" link?
There's also the fact that the ampersand is not "html_entit'ified" in  
the "others_drafts" case, but that not too big of a deal (though it  
probably should be consistent).

Let me know.

Stephane

Scratch that, $user_ID is set to -1 in the "others_drafts" case, and  
is therefore working as expected.

The html entity issue is the only one left.

Generally, if your Page does anything particularly special, then it's
using a special Template, one would hope.

So, one approach might be to make Pages that are using custom Page
Templates to be excluded from the search results. Normal Pages that
just have content in normal template structure would then show up just
like Posts do.

While I don't necessarily agree with putting Pages in the search, I
can see why some people would think it would search Pages. However, I
do think that the search should absolutely search for matching Tags.
Tags are basically self-made keywords, not using them for search is
crazy.

set_theme_capability('full_search',true) sounds like a reasonable  
solution to me, but I think we'll also need to put the excerpt field  
on the Page editing screen so that people can have a chance at  
writing reasonable synopses of their pages (espy those with forms).

Hi,

Here is a little help to get you started.

Generating a list of functions per WP version is a once off operation
(only needs to be repeated for each new version coming out).  I guess
doing it in command line is simpler and shorter than in PHP.  Here is
a working example, which I ran in a tags/ directory checked out from
WP SVN:

======
for DIR in * ; do cd $DIR && echo "Working on $DIR" && grep '^function
' `find | grep '.php' | grep -v '.svn'` | sed -e 's/^.*:function //'
-e 's/(.*$//' | sort | uniq > "../$DIR.txt" && cd .. ; done
======

It works for about half a minute on my ancient laptop and produces a
list of text files like:

2.0.txt
2.1.1.txt
2.1.2.txt
2.1.3.txt
2.1.txt
2.2.1.txt
2.2.2.txt
2.2.3.txt
2.2.txt
2.3.txt

In each of those files there is an alphabetically sorted list of
functions for that version.  One function per line with no parameters
or anything.  The list of functions looks something like:

__
add_action
add_clean_index
add_custom_image_header
add_feed
add_filter
add_js
add_link
addLoadEvent
add_magic_quotes
add_management_page
add_menu_page

With something as trivial as grep and diff you can find the
differences between version and all version where the function exists,
and from there - when it was first defined.

Overall it works pretty good for something I spent 10 minutes on.  The
things that you should keep in mind are:

- the above looks for function definitions which only happen in .php
files and start from the beginning of line.

- the above doesn't care if the php file was actually included or not,
or if the function is commented out via multiline comment


And just to give a digital candy to anyone who finished reading this
long email, here are some simple stats from the resulting files.

Number of functions per WordPress version:

552 1.5
569 1.5.1
569 1.5.1.1
569 1.5.1.2
569 1.5.1.3
570 1.5.2

702 2.0
706 2.0.1
706 2.0.2
718 2.0.3
729 2.0.4
733 2.0.5
735 2.0.6
735 2.0.7
735 2.0.8
735 2.0.9
738 2.0.10
744 2.0.11

883 2.1
883 2.1.1
883 2.1.2
887 2.1.3

951 2.2
953 2.2.1
953 2.2.2
954 2.2.3

1058 2.3

Enjoy ;)

I think a combination of set_theme_capability() and Otto's suggestion  
RE templates might be best.

That is: rather than indicating on a page by page basis if it's  
compatible, do it on a  _template by template_ basis.  In the theme,  
each page template has to have a marker that indicates "search  
compatible".

Either way, I'm all for adding an excerpt field to pages, just on  
general principle.  This could be useful for more than just search:   
Imagine, for example, a site index page that shows the name of the  
page _and_ the description, drawn from that field.

Viper007bond might also have to be careful of functions that _change_  
from one version to the next.

Still, very cool idea.  :)

Excellent! This would solve a lot of *my* issues with having to write
special synopsises on a master page for each one of it's subpages.

+1 on the excerpt idea. I use the_excerpt as the meta description for
all pages on the site. It would be very nice to be able to manually
define this for Pages.

get_the_title, get_the_ID, and remove_action come to mind immediately.

New filters would also have to be accounted for.

Oh, totally. I've been thinking about a compatibility-layer plugin for
some time, given that I want my plugin(s) to work all the way back to
1.5.2. It's a very similar vein to this type of checking. I don't think
there's any precedent for a "library" plugin like that, though.

Template Search compatible might be ok, but surely people use pages and 
posts in various ways on their sites - wordpress is flexible, but 
generally one might assume that pages are for more static (unchanging, 
or not often) content, posts for more transient content...
It makes no sense to me to exclude page content - whatever the user is 
looking for may be on a post _or_ a page
they can see page content by selecting it from the menu or whatever, so 
would expect it to show up in search results - even if the result just 
shows the titles of the post/page, at least it would be there.
So please - Search => results from both posts and pages, (and showing 
excerpts where available is fine - some will make heavy use of them some 
not I guess).

Chris
P.S.  I hope the idea was not to _just_ search the excerpt for the 
results - apologies if I have missed something!

Heh, that's pretty much identical to what I was going to do, except I was
going to do it in PHP (as it's the only thing I know).

Mind saving me some trouble and sending those text files my way? :D

Um... You might have to check for constants too.  I'm guessing a  
couple new ones have been added over time?

The problem is how do you display the results? If somebody has, say,
an email form on a Page, and a search happens to find it, then it's
going to be returned in the Loop and now your form displays on the
search results page.

If you're going to allow searching of Pages, then there is going to be
stuff displayed on the search results page that you may not want
displayed on that page.

Like I mentioned before, if pages are going to be searched in a future
release it should be an option. And while there is an option to
enable/disable page searching there easily can be a field to exclude page or
post ids.

Yes, take your point about forms - on my sites I only display the titles 
of items that contain the search word, not the whole thing.  I guess 
that the excerpt idea would get around that  if  they are added - I 
don't know how/if most blogs make heavy use of excerpts?
I can't think of any other content you wouldn't want displayed (i.e. is 
likely to cause a $_POST) so maybe just exclude forms from the results?

Pages are able to have excerpt.

There is just no UI to define them

This simple plugin I wrote a while ago exposes the necessary UI:
http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/page-excerpt/

I use it (along with my query-child plugin) to power my WordPress
plugins page here: http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/

Hey folks,

  I've been having some trouble with getting the plugin upgrade feature
to work for my plugin[1]. I poked around and inferred a bit about how
the update system backend works[2]. Unfortunately, I also found a few
less-than-ideal behaviors, two of which stem from the assumption that
all plugins are hosted with WordPress:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5115
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5116
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5117

I'm pretty concerned about 5115 and 5117 security-wise, since the user
can get the impression that all his/her plugins are up-to-date when
they're not. Any extra eyes on this feature or comments on the bugs
would be appreciated.


Thanks,

#5115: Unable to reproduce. It works fine for me on multiple installs on
multiple OSes. If this issue was widespread, I'm sure it would have been
reported much earlier. Sounds like a non-issue or some very rarely occurring
bug due to server configuration or something.

#5116: Valid, somewhat. If "Plugin A" has existed for years, I hope the
moderators of the official repository aren't going to accept a request for a
plugin of the same there, so that prevents that. In the reverse, plugin
authors shouldn't be noobs and name their plugins the same as ones already
existing on the repository. All that said, I don't see a real code solution
to this all as the URI, author, etc. is all able to change. There's no real
constants when it comes to plugins.

#5117: Agreed, although it would get rather spammy with a bar below each
non-known plugin. We'd need to find a clean way to display this notice.

I found the real problem: the top-level title of the readme.txt is
what's used for the check. Argh. Is there -code- for the backend? Or
documentation? Having to reverse-engineer how the darn thing works is
just obnoxious.

Come now, that's not helpful to pointing out or solving the "why
doesn't my plugin update" question, and you know it. ;)

It may be an appropriate place to add that information, though.

I'm doing a scan of SVN right now to see how many registered plugins
will actually work with the current upgrade system; I'm interested to
see how effective the current system is with the plugins we have.

I wasn't trying to be an ass, I was trying to be helpful since your
malformed readme was the problem. Or did I misread?

great.

now, what about non-gpl plugins?

how can those plugins receive the same service?

do we agree that for the sake of the users, it's better to enable this 
functionality for all plugins, regardless of their license?

(for the record, I don't have much to gain here personally, my own 
plugin got it's own version check mechanism, and it will continue to use 
it in any case).

I've been having some trouble with getting the plugin upgrade feature
  to work for my plugin[1].Thanks for your ticket in trac. Looks like my plugin is having the same  problem. I've updated the readme file and we'll see how it goes.

Michael.

The readme wasn't malformed (per se) -- in fact, it was based off that
very template file. The issue was that the initial title did not
*exactly* match the title in the Plugin Name field in my php file. You
can run an older readme[1] through the validator[2], and it'll come out
clean as a whistle (save for known-missing sections).

That's a requirement to get the update service to match the plugin with
the right entry in SVN -- and that's not documented anywhere that I've
found (including the example readme).

It doesn't necesarily have to be GPL. According to the about page[1] it only
has to be GPL-compatible[2].

You're dodging the point. There will invariably be some plugins that
are not hosted with WordPress, for licensing reasons or otherwise.
These are currently left out of the loop. Are there plans to allow
these plugins some way to notify users of new versions via core? Like,
allowing folks to register stub projects with only version information?

This doesn't particularly affect me, either, but it *is* a good
question from the user's standpoint.

I'm not dodging the point at all. I was merely responding to Omry, not you,
and from my understanding, he thought that only GPL plugins could be hosted
with the plugin repository, but my response was that it only needed to be
GPL-compatible.

You might get better answers if you weren't so affronting.

I can read, and I did know that any GPL compatible plugins are allowed.

you may have no intended to, but you did dodge the point.

Travis response to you was exactly what I wanted to say.

A few things:

1. I never said you can't read. I never suggested you couldn't read. I was
merely stating a point.

2. Why ask "what about non-gpl plugins" then? A much better question, for
what I believe is your actual question, would have been "what about plugins
not hosted on the plugins repository?". This would have been more specific
and spared this whole exchange.

My point was that if you're concerned about non-GPL plugins, then those can
*also* be hosted on the WP.org plugins repository, as long as the license is
GPL-compatible. I wasn't saying anything about whether or not external
plugins would be able to have the update notification service. My apologies
for your lack of specific phrasing.

no harm done.

now that we all understand each other, I hope to get some response from
the Core devs/Matt on this.

Rough breakdown:
 * 1920 entries in http://svn.wp-plugins.org/
 *  907 had a .php file containing plugin name metadata in trunk
 *  643 had a non-empty file named readme.txt in trunk
 *  358 had a first line in the readme that matched (case-insensitive)
the plugin name metadata

So, 358 is a rough minimum of the number of plugins updates should work
with. The raw data, script that collected the raw data, and
sed-processed data subsets are all available in the trac bug[1]. Please
don't beat up the poor SVN repo with the script. ;)

More interesting stats (like picking out the most popular plugins to
see if they're compatible or not) is left as an exercise to the reader;
my brain's had more than 24 hours of uptime, and its about ready to
crash.

I will confirm the lack of update issue, the version checker is also case sensitive which had us fooled when we had a lower/uppercase issue in the first line of the README vs SVN..

Lucky for us it was a simple matter of changing the README but it was a pain because none of us could understand why it was not working..

Not sure if you want to call it a bug , but Trac 5115 is valid..

thank you for chiming in on this. but:

what exactly does this mean? you indicate that you are fine with
abstracting the schema ( up to the point it runs on pgsql as well ? )

is this correct?

i am willing and able to reform the schema up to the point that it
still runs on mysql ( without performance degration at all ) and works
for postgresql as well.

but, for me this will only have value if other patches are welcome too:
  fix some queries which use "`" character
  remove "IGNORE" keyword from certain INSERT-stmts
  fix some GROUP BY-stmts
  fix limit stmts from LIMIT x,y to LIMIT y OFFSET x
  fix use of C-style operator "!=" to "<>"
  fix writing '' to fields which you want to be filled with the
default-value from the schema ( writing posts and pages )
  abstract FOUND_ROWS

mysql specific functions do not need to be touched at all: these can
be defined in pgsql and there is a mysql-function-library for pgsql
available.

i appreciate your response.

regards,

usleep

Since MySQL is the required database for WordPress, I think we might as well
take advantage of MySQL-specific features, and not try to make it all
"generic". If we're going to only support 1 database, we should take
advantage of that.

I'm not saying this just to make using other databases harder, either. I'm
saying it because WordPress has already decided to use just MySQL, and
that's what you should be running it on...
