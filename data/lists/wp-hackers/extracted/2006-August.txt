interesting.  well, future posting already takes care of when stuff shows 
up, so you just need something to make it disappear. ;)

I can imagine a plugin that takes a date (or a number of days from the post 
date...) stored in a custom field, and when that date passes it maybe 
changes the post status to draft or private or something.  That wouldn't be 
too hard.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Looking for a time-based content plugin


| Greetings all. Happy Monday.
|
| So late tonight (2am Tuesday CST) I have to go in a client's
| MovableType setup and removed all references to a campaign which ends
| July 31. This will involve changes to the template for the home page
| and sidebar. Should take me about 1.5 hours.
|
| So it got me thinking about my other clients who use WP and the drive
| to automate as much as possible. Is there some plugin for WP that
| would perform this action form me?  Meaning have some content
| automatically display depending on a date/time range?
|
| Is anyone aware of something even close to this that I could extend
| for my own needs?

Agreed. Does not seem too hard. There was a PHP Advertising server I  
played around with last year that had this feature. You define the  
banner or whatever ad  to display on your site. Then you can define a  
roll in-roll out time. You also define an alternate ad to be shown  
when the time is outside the campaign. I'm going to start on  
something like this. But I wanted to check if anyone had seen or  
built something first. No use starting from scratch.

I think this use is more than Matt and the original developer  
intended for WP. But as I use this more and more to develop client  
sites they bring up interesting features that can mostly be  
implemented via some custom plugins.

I think you can. My sideblog plugin can be put multiple times even on one
sidebar.

Yeah, I know phpAdsNew can run an ad campaign for a period, and because it 
is periodic it takes precedence in the 'slot'.

Would probably be easiest to just do it as a custom field which is days to 
run the post, a wp-cron hook for checking maybe every N hours where you look 
for that custom field set to a non-zero value and the matching posts, and if 
the days have expired set the post status to private and clear the custom 
field (either to zero or remove it from the table completely).  Should be 
that simple.

Do you mind expanding on that? I use K2, and I wouldn't leave it for
the world, I just don't see the things you're talking about (essential
items that aren't there, etc.)

Not to be a party-pooper, but most of the things you are now talking
about are already available as plugins.. unless that is your goal? To
make a theme that comes with plugins already in it?

There _is_ a fix.
It's not the WP sidebar per say. It's called "Nybble's Sidebar
Modules" and it's the Widgets Sidebar taken to the next level, you may
be interested.

http://nybblelabs.org.uk/projects/sidebar-modules/

It's its own thing, but fully compatible with widgets for the official
sidebar and does just what you want.

Message-ID: <5f280150608010210y3b07879aybfb94f75768b6cdd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, i have read this fix [http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2953]
on the WP 2.0.4:
XSS Vulnerability in the 'post_tilte' parameter in
wp-admin/page-new.php while submitting thought the "Create New page"
option.

But I think this vulnerability there also is in the 'the_content'
parameter if you put on post.php post field:

<script><!--
alert('XSS Vulnerable');
--></script>

For this reason I had made the script manager plugin
[http://wp-plugins.net/plugin/script-manager/]

This have to be considered a bug?

No.

The admin (and any other user with the unfiltered_html capability) can
post whatever they like by design. (As ryan wrote in reply to that trac
ticket)

A low level user or commenter without this capability will have the script
tag stripped out by kses.

Another simple option is that when your plugin does the update call,
pass the WP version as a get parameter. This works alongside the "two
separate URI's" method, but will give those who want to PHP up their
RDF's a way to tell. It'd also be nice for plugin authors to know what
v. of wp is using their plugin most ;)

Thanks guys,
I guess this is a feature for a future release... in the meantime i set up
an rss export for the links, and import them with an rss plugin

Message-ID: <47eaad680608010842h5197633cye079b0a6bafd9203@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to set up my single post page so that the previous and next posts
show in the sidebar, here's the code i'm using:

<?php
$prev = get_previous_post();
query_posts("p=$prev->ID&showposts=1");
?>
... the loop ...

<?php
$next = get_next_post();
query_posts("p=$next->ID&showposts=1");
?>
... the loop ...

the first query works fine, the second just shows the same post as the main
post on the page. if i reverse them, still it's only the first one that
works fine.
Any ideas?

get_previous_post() and get_next_post() will be influenced by any
thing you do with query_posts() and/or the loop, so its best to store
the value before you start doing things.

Not at all.  K2 is a theme created by web designers for web designers (or at
least the web-savvy).  If we want to change something, we just muck about in
the files, track classes and IDs back to the CSS, change the XHTML if
necessary, and fix it.

My project is for everyone else.  If you want to change the font size/style
of your post titles, you just go to the options page and change it.  Now
just extend that philosophy to everything else you'd want to change (number
of columns, position of the sidebar(s), font sizes/styles, colors and/or
gradients, blah blah blah).  And of course, everything must work perfectly
and consistently on all modern browsers.

Hope that's helpful,

I haven't chimed in before on this thread, and perhaps my input isn't
worth much, but I think this is a wonderful (and ambitious) project.
Seems to me that this would do wonders to get people to move from
blogger and some of the other "point-and-shoot" blogging tools to WP.

I am highly technical and was able to create a unique and (IMHO)
good-looking theme for my web site (http://clwill.com).  But my brother,
a devoted blogger fan (http://barkbarkwoofwoof.com), would have been
completely overwhelmed by the challenge of creating a WP theme.  So he
has tweaked and tweaked a blogspot theme... but he'd still like it to be
more unique.  As a huge WP fan, I tried to get him to WP, but the hill
is too steep.

I believe many others are similarly situated -- too sophisticated for
blogger, too non-technical for WP (and others like it).  This project
seems like a super bridge between these worlds.  Add in an installation
that doesn't require you to edit a text file, and you have a "blogger
killer" :)

So... I fully support this, and if I can lend a hand in some small way,
let me know.

I have, and it's not as easy or intuitive to use as what I think is being
suggested with this project.

Excellent, thank you!  I intend to have a preliminary proof-of-concept by
mid-month.

This looks really interesting.  So, folks who use this would create Canvas
themes and plug-ins rather than Wordpress themes/plug-ins/widgets?

Hi everyone,

I'm a bit confused about the best way to have a plugin seize control
of the entire page. I don't want any Loop or posts or anything, I just
need my plugin to hijack certain requests and then inject arbitrary
content between the theme's header and footer.

Hijacking requests is no problem, given the init hook, but I'm less
sure about how to proceed with the rest. Will I need to create my own
"page template" that contains a callback to the plugin's content
function? If so, is there a straightforward way to package such a
thing?

Thanks,

Mike

BTW, is the intent for this to work for themes as well?

RDF sounds a little top-heavy.  Could each plug-in/theme just have an
associated feed pointing to the latest release (or releases, if there are
both 1.x and 2.x releases?)  Assuming a couple namespace extensions,
something like...

<?xml version="1.0"?>

That's how I do it.  Find below an example of a Page Template for one
of my blogs.  The header and the footer are called (The sidebar is
called by the header in this theme) and then you have the function
call.

Hope this helps,
-drmike

<?php
/*
Template Name: Complete List of Blogs
*/
?>

<?php
get_header();
?>

<?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>

<?php the_date('','<h2>','</h2>'); ?>
	
<div class="post">
	 <h3 class="storytitle" id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>"><a href="<?php
the_permalink() ?>" rel="bookmark"><?php the_title(); ?></a></h3>
	<div class="meta"><?php edit_post_link(__('Edit This')); ?>
	</div><!-- end META -->
	
	<div class="storycontent">
<?php list_all_wpmu_blogs('', 'name', '<br />', '', 'last_created'); ?>
	</div><!-- end STORYCONTENT -->

</div><!-- end POST -->

<?php endwhile; else: ?>
<p><?php _e('Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.'); ?></p>
<?php endif; ?>

<?php get_footer(); ?>

I have found page templates to be incredibly useful for things you do  
only to your own site but less useful for plugins you plan to  
distribute.  If your plugin makes use of a page template, you'll have  
to have your users upload the plugin to the plugins directory and the  
page template to the correct theme directory.  Plus, your markup  
probably won't match the user's theme, so you'll have to add in your  
own CSS which *also* won't match the theme....

Depending on how much control you really need, the_content, the_posts  
and the various query filters might be enough for you.  This method  
will ensure that most of the markup will be what the user's  
particular theme expects.

If you need more control than that, you can create a custom template  
to be placed in the *plugins* directory and get it to load with the  
template_redirect action.  With this method, you eliminate the  
multiple directory disadvantage found in the page template method but  
not the markup/styling problem.

Also, note that in WP2.1, WP can hijack the front page for you  
(create at least one Page and go to Options->Reading/Front Page or  
directly set the page_on_front option).

That's what it is, more or less. You just posted an RDF - I'm using
the same thing :-D, just a different tags...

ATM it's strictly plugins as far as what my code checks. But what's a
theme more than just one big plugin anyway? I don't see why it can't
be expanded to work with a theme, as a matter of fact, since most
themes don't have 'install' or 'uninstall' issues, it might even be
easier, I dunno...

At any rate, I'll be releasing this code most likely the day after
tomorrow one way or the other, and the community can do whatever it
likes to the code :-) I'm a nice guy =P

The technologist side of me is not worried about the teensy differences
between RDF and RSS, but the marketing side of me urges you to go with a
standard feed format if it doesn't make a huge difference to the success of
the product.

The cool thing about RSS is that it's potentially useful immediately with
/and/ without the rest of the system.  Plus, when we explain this to people,
we're not going to have to spend time educating people on RDF and the minute
differences between RDF and RSS.

C'mon, RSS...microformats...it's Web 2.0, baby!   :O)

I normally hook into `template_redirect`, then check the conditions of 
the request to see if I want to load my template, then load_template() 
my own full-page template, then `die` to prevent the loading of the 
regular template. Whew.

Hello,

Is there a way to temporarily view a site in a certain style, for
development purposes?

Currently I'm manually switching back and forth, so anybody visiting my site
might get a surprise.

That's why most people download and run Xampp, on their own computers.. so 
they can do all these theme changes and tests.. without having the 
possiblity of someone seeing goof ups and such.. =)

Locally installed webserver, or use the switch theme plugin or preview 
theme plugins:

http://boren.nu/archives/2004/10/13/theme-switcher-plugin/
http://boren.nu/archives/2005/03/08/preview-theme-plugin/

Both work fine with the latest versions of WP I believe.

Excellent...thanks for the pointers, gentlemen.  It sounds like setting up a

Hi All,

Just switched to Wordpress from Movable Type and Blogger.... and I love wp!

Can anyone tell me:
1.  How  I can make a static Page (not a Post) my wp Home Page... think I
read something about a plugin.
2.  How I can assign my Categories to the static Pages (only Post pages have
a Categories option; not my write/edit Pages).

I am very experienced with tweaking css and can code XMTL, but I am just
beginning to dabble in PHP.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <D37CAFF1-526B-4EE1-98FD-02FEA6DFBC07@codehooligans.com>

Hi all,

I have a client who has over 750 Pages (not Posts) in a WP 2.0.2  
installation.

There are two issues I noticed this morning.

1. When they go Save a new or existing page the page does save but  
they are not taken back to the blank edit page form with the response  
message. Instead they get an error page.

2. When I go to Options --> Permalinks to check the settings the page  
does partially loads. I get the Blue banner. The top menu. The start  
of the options menu: General, Writing, Reading, Discussion. I then  
get what appears to be the start of an anchor tag. Assumed this if  
the Permalinks sub-nav menu item. That is it. No JS or HTML errors  
reports.

My question is could the large number of files somehow be affecting  
the use of the items mentioned above? Also I recently install the  
Blicki plugin to capture some versioning. Just deactivated this  
option while investigating the issue.

Last. I did make some changes to the edit-pages.php code and the  
get_rows() function in admin-functions.php. This was because the  
Pages listing was taking 4-6 minutes to load. These changes also have  
now been reverted back to the original 2.0.2 code.

Anyone seen something like this before?

Message-ID: <20060802211221.GF19743@kimmo.suominen.com>

Hi!

It looks like there are no filters for the contents of the outgoing
pingbacks and trackbacks.  Have I just not looked in the right place?

I'd like to be able to convert the contents of outgoing pingbacks and
trackbacks to UTF-8 using iconv().

I can already do the necessary charset conversion for incoming pingbacks
and trackbacks using the preprocess_comment filter.  (I need to look at
comment_type to avoid running iconv() on comments entered on the site
itself, which must not be converted.)

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

There are no filters for trackbacks apart from the default content and
excerpt ones which won't really help.

You can't do this for pingbacks.

The ping'd site is what creates the excerpt that is shown not your site.

It works like this (taken from [1]):

1. Alice posts to her blog. The post she's made includes a link to a
post on Bob's blog.

2. Alice's blogging system contacts Bob's blogging system and says
"look, Alice made a post which linked to one of your posts".

3. Bob's blogging system then includes a link back to Alice's post on
his original post.

4. Reader's of Bob's article can follow this link to Alice's post to
read her opinion.

Hello,

Could we move some folders a little closer to the surface?

	Themes	wordpress/themes/
	Plug-Ins	wordpress/plug-ins/
	Widgets	wordpress/widgets/

It doesn't mean that the deeper folder locations couldn't work, but it would
be more convenient.

I know conversation about this issue started w/ great fervor, but
unfortunately it died out abruptly w/ no real resolution.

Isn't there a "quick fix" of any sort that can resolve the issue of posts
going up in full form (w/ images, separate pages, etc) @ the correct set
time, regardless of the lags that come along w/ it.

I'm just looking for the absolute minimum & I'm sure people who use this
functionality can attest to its importance in Wordpress :-)))

Anyway, if anyone would like to either do the fix or possibly downgrade my
DB to a functional 2.04 version, please do get in touch. Maybe we can work
something out.

thank you!!

It's just the future posting is very important to some people and
unfortunately it's not too high on the priority list for most coders.

I'm currently using 2.1A2, but I understand it's still broken in the latest

This involves more detailed installation, upgrade, and permissions

Yeah, -1.  All the content should be under one subfolder.

And I have further reason for that... The path to the content dir should be 
defined as a variable (potentially defaulted in wp-config.php), and never 
hardcoded in the main wp code.  This would allow for people to change their 
paths (content wouldn't have to be in user-accessible space necessarily!), 
change the name (shorten it to 'c' if you want), allow for things like 
easier virtual/multiple site deployments (code in wp-config or plugin shifts 
which content directory is referenced, etc.).  It would also make for 
cleaner/easier coding of stuff that references into wp-content (such as 
creating files there) -- though that could be alleviated by having some 
'other' subdir in content used for the 'dumping ground' (I dunno, '/misc'?).

Just my 2c.

Agreed. Bloggers who wish to have folders in the root can generate a symlink
to the default folders in the root directory.

Someone on the forums is having this error, while using the 
comments-popup.php file from the default theme.

Anyway, the problem is this: when you click on their comments link (to open 
the popup comments), the window opens with an error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined function: get_approved_comments() in 
URL/wp-content/themes/orange-crush-5242006/comments-popup.php on line 44

Apparently this doesn't happen to everyone, that downloaded her theme.. 
<quote> "there's been over 1200 people downloading the theme, and only two 
have reported this problem, so I'm guessing the problem does not lie with 
the theme." </quote>

Here's a link to the support forum thread..

Can someone maybe post an opinion, suggestion.. anything please..?  I was 
going to post a suggestion.. but figured I'd ask the professionals here

I've never seen that error before myself... so, I have no idea why only 2

I love it!  So the arguments against are simultaneously:

    (1) Users are too stupid to not touch more than one folder.

    (2) Users are to smart enough that they can "just create symlinks".

:^)

> All the content should be under one subfolder.

Everything would still be under the "wordpress" folder, and there's no reason that the older, less-convenient places for these items <grin> couldn't be supported as well.

I know everyone here is used to it, but conceptually, it's odd to hear themes, plug-ins and widgets referred to as "content".

No, people without permalinks have these ugly "feed-templates" in
their URIs, not great. Maybe a /feed/ directory, but that could
interfere with the rewrites for those who have it installed. I think
they're perfectly fine as they are.

Ah, when you upgrade WordPress itself...I understand now, sorry.  I still don't quite get the argument, since you have to update it whenever WP changes neccessitate changes to the base styles (e.g. updates to support widgets).

Right now, the folder theoretically reserved for content contains templates, plug-ins and a (presumably internal?) cache, which seems odd.  I think it would be interesting if WP "owned" an application folder and index.php, and then there was a series of "my" folders (the actual name isn't important) for uses to mess with.  It would also make it a lot easier to work with templates in tools like Dreamweaver, etc., if components were a little more compartmentalized.  Maybe something like this:
	
	wordpress
		my-images
		my-plug-ins
		my-themes
		my-widgets
		application
			cache
			feed-templates
				wp-atom
				(etc.)
			includes
			images
			plug-ins			
			themes
			widgets
			xmlrpc.php
			(etc.)
		index.php

Okay, I'll stop adding to the thread...just needed to get that out.

I should've read the code more carefully -- I must admit I was surprised
when I came to the (wrong) conclusion that the whole post content is
sent out in the ping...  :)

So basically the "fix" is to teach function pingback.ping in xmlrp.php
to look at the charset of the content it is retrieving, and converting
it when necessary.  Then wait 10 years for everyone else to adopt that
in their software...

I guess the best place is to add a filter in wp_remote_fopen() so I can
have access to $http_response_header and use curl options to build a
similar array.

And I see that receiving trackbacks already does the right thing using
mb_convert_encoding(), so I can just follow that example (as opposed to
using iconv() as I had planned).

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

Subject: [wp-hackers] Issues with wpautop and my plugin
Message-ID: <44D1E495.80206@viper007bond.com>

I'm adding HTML into a post via a filter.

Let's say my code is structured like this:

<this><is><some><html>

The problem is that wpautop is doing basically this:

<p><this><br />
<is><br />
<some><html>
</p>

How can I stop those line breaks from being added? Should I like use 
some regex to get rid of them?

I can provide the actual (but ugly) code if need be.

Add your filter after wpautop, e.g.

add_filter('comment_text', 'myfilter', 99);

Hmm, I'm doing basically BBCode as the placeholder:

[mytag foo="bar"]blah[/mytag]

If I do 99, the quotes get turned to fancy quotes. Anything I can do 
about that? Or should I just go any search for the fancy quoted version 
of my tag (which shouldn't be hard to do)?

I raised the bug but I didn't actually get round to investigating it properly.  I'll try and take a
look at it over the weekend, but anyone else is also welcome to, of course.

You could always remove the wpautop filter and call wpautop from your
own code with the second argument being 0.

    remove_filter('the_content', 'wpautop');
    add_filter('the_content', 'myfilter', 99);

    function myfilter($text)
    {
	//... do whatever first
	wpautop($text, 0);
    }

This would skip the part that inserts "<br />" at each newline
character.

Alternatively you could just make sure you don't have newlines in the
wrong places.

Actually, I don't see how

    <this><is><some><html>

would be affected (except after the last tag), while

    <this>
    <is>
    <some>
    <html>

would be.  But I could be reading the lookbehind regexp wrong...

The Markdown plugin has a good list of filters to remove and priorities
for where to add your own filters, if you need to play with wpautop.
I like it how comments get "converted" to HTML before insertion into
the database (while posts and pages are kept in Markdown format).

I'm convinced there's something up with the list server. Some mails are
making it some are not (which seems to be affecting everyone equally), last
week after making a couple of posts which never appeared to both -forums and
-hackers about various topics, I went ahead and posted to the Misc section
of the forums to see if anyone else was having issues. 

Based on the fact that this still seems to be happening (and to all of the
lists), I'd suggest that at least until the issue is identified/resolved (or
just disappears on it's own), if your email to a particular list (or all of
them) isn't showing up, go ahead and contact a couple of regular
readers/posters directly to be sure that the community/others are aware of
the particular issue.

Hey all,

I submitted a patch for this ticket.  We can probably move this convo to

Anyone experiencing anything similar? My mem% usage stays @ a constant
11.4%& when someone leaves a comment, the load shoots up to like ~2-3.
I noticed
this started to happen yesterday, but noticed the specific load stuff today
when I decided to dig a little deeper. I upgraded to the latest trunk on
July 22nd.

I'm using the latest ver of *wp-cache <http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/>
*, 2.0.17.

Any thoughts?

Hi,
I was wondering, what are the differences between the two for using inside
the loop? I hade a theme that worked fine on my test server (apache 1.x, php
4 mac os x) with the_date() but broke on the live site (apache 2, php 5 and
linux) some dates would show, and some wouldn't/ it was the weirdest thing.
after hours of debugging, i tried switching to the_time) and it works great.
anyone know why?

the_date only outputs once per day regardless of how many times you call
it (by design)

you're (*hopefully*) going to get this email twice, there has been some kind
of problem with the wp mailing list server over the past week and messages
have been either not showing up or taking days to come through, so I cc'd
your personal address to be sure you receive the response. 

out of order - 
2) Pages can't have categories, there's been extensive discussion on this
topic if you review the mailing list archives, it's not worth going over
here, but that's the answer in a nutshell. Folks have come up with various
plugins/hacks and workarounds to accomplish the effect, you'll need to take
a look at the -hackers list archive for the details. 

1) This is the easy one. there are a number of options to accomplish this,
there are a number of plugins available that will provide this
functionality, the process is also documented at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#WordPress_as_a_CMS (including a link to one
of the static home page plugins), check out 
http://wp-plugins.net/ for more on the plugins available. the static page
plugins are scattered across a number of categories there depending on
specific functionality, etc. 

there's also some really great information to get you started at -

the_date shows a given date ONCE through The Loop, as 'dividers' between 
days -- if it displayed already for a given day, it doesn't output anything 
on further calls.  If you want every post to have a timestamp, use the_time, 
which outputs all the time, no checks.

I believe that wpautop() hooks in at priority 10.  So all you have to  
do is know that AFTER 10, wpautop() won't mess with it.  So just  
change your filter's priority to be something like 50.  Beats having  
to do cleanup after wpautop() mangles it.

Yes, but then my quotes get turned into fancy quotes and such. Is the 
best solution to have a priority of 50 and then search for my WordPress 
formatted version of my placeholder?

Why don't you hook in before wpautop and use a series of characters
wpautop will ignore (such as ###QUOTE### or the like), and then hook
in again after wpautop and replace each ###QUOTE### with actual
quotation marks?

If it's wptexturize adding the fancy quotes, can't you just move that
filter to run after yours?

Remove `wptexturize`, add your filter with a lower priority than 
`wpautop`, then re-add `wptexturize` with an even higher priority than that.

remove_filter('the_content', 'wptexturize');
add_filter('the_content', 'your_function', 25);
add_filter('the_content', 'wptexturize', 50);

Thanks, Robert. The template_redirect + load_template() bit was perfect.

What I'm actually doing, which is kind of cool, is letting outside
scripts call wp-blog-header.php, but first set a global variable
called $content. When the plugin detects this variable, it shows that
content rather than whatever the default would have been.

One of the things we use it for is source-code displays, such as the following:

http://googlemapsbook.com/chapter6/dataFiltering/map_functions.js.source#listing-6-20

Obviously, there are some htaccess redirect rules at work here, as
well, but you get the external dynamic content, and it's all inside a
standard WP theme. Hope that's helpful to someone.

Mike

Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAKSaglRSZk9Oqp49Gb2lalrCgAAAEAAAAPsBN/C0yAhFiGb37GpybKoBAAAAAA==@comcast.net>

As I stated, based on all of the negative buzz in the past few weeks over
security issues I probably 'read' more into the question than might have
been there. As far as the issue itself, the OP stated: 

/snip
I've been using phpBB for ages and I've been using other (shock, horror)
blog software and what I deeply like about both is there repository of
Plugins that have been validated by the core team thus I have someone to
trust on a Plugins validity.
/snip

Personally, I've been involved with the phpBB project since 2001 with
varying degrees of activity based on what else I've had going on, that
project has had more than it's share of controversy, the *community* can be
abrasive at times and is definitely not very open-minded or forward thinking
in terms of planning and decision making. Jim Finn (one of the founders of
the project) is surely a bright and talented young individual with lots on
his plate, and does a pretty good job of keeping things running smoothly
(ironically his personal site is proudly powered of course by wordpress...),
but many of the key developers on the project seem to like the
"dictatorship" model of operation, and often resist ideas and contributions
from the community which don't match up with their personal opinions. One of
the things I've worked hard on there with a small group of other individuals
is the idea of pushing phpBB in the direction of standards compliance and a
bit more 'modular' of a plugin architecture. Unfortunately neither of these
concepts are very well received by many of the decision makers (although
we've never really pushed the issues hard with Jim personally which I know
would probably lead to an eventual change in the phpBB paradigm). These two
particular issues are a constant FAQ and often controversial topic as new
users adopt the platform, with questions like why can't I.... a)
permalinks/friendly Uri's b)xhtml/css compliance c)the last upgrade ruined
my site and DB because all of my modules had made so many edits to the core
files... etc. 

It's a given, that phpBB is a completely different animal than WP, but
architecture wise, there is much to be learned from how others have done
things and the mistakes they've made. With regards to the plugin topic
specifically, the current WP architecture as a theory is what I would
consider a 'best of breed' solution, even though at the moment there may be
some specific issues with regards to it's implementation. As I stated in my
forum post, products like phpBB which allow (or often require) that a module
or plugin 'edit' (albeit transparently to most users) core system files (and
the DB architecture) in order to 'just work', are in my opinion a way less
than desirable situation. Unfortunately many users don't fully understand a)
that this happens at all, b) what's really happening when they install a mod
or plugin, or c) it's potential effect later on. 

The disadvantages (which are clearly demonstratable via things like the
phpBB support forums) are as follows:
1)Upgrades to the core are risky and difficult after a plugin/mod has been
installed, the upgrade scripts simply can't account for all of the changes
made by the mods/plugins, this often leads to completely 'broken' sites
which need to be re-installed from the ground up. 
2) A failed mod/plugin install has no rollback mechanism requirement, so
users are left with partially edited/broken core system files and often no
clue as to how/where to attempt to fix things.
3) Even though it may appear that something like phpBB plugins are *blessed*
via the phpbb.com site's mod repository, there are no [enforced]
requirements for a plugin to adhere to any particular set of standards, most
importantly IMO - CLEAN UP AFTER ITSELF IF A USER UNINSTALLS IT. I can not
emphasize how critical an issue this is, sure, go to your phpBB admin
interface and 'uninstall' a mod, then go look at all of the code changes to
core system files and the database that the plugin made when it was
installed which were not 'removed' after you've uninstalled it. 

there are a couple of others, but those are the big points. 

by contrast, wordpress is really clean in terms of the plugin architecture.
this leads me to the point of this dissertation. the existing methodology
and design of the plugin portion of WP is extremely elegant and powerful -
both from a technical AND a marketing perspective. Continuing along the
current path and improving on it is without doubt a worthy cause. It's a
tremendous selling point for the WP platform moving forward to emphasize the
flexibility, power and secure nature of the basic plugin architecture. When
a new user makes a forum post stating something like "I installed x plugin
and now my site doesn't work..." the ability to point them to the codex or
simply state - "just delete the plugin file or directory", then like magic
everything works again is really impressive. The fact WP plugins don't need
to interfere with the core system is a HUGE advantage over other platforms.
Upgrades are normally a breeze, personally I've upgraded 20+ installs so far
(most from 2.0.2 directly to 2.0.4) and had not a single issue or problem
with one of them (fingers crossed, since I left the 3 biggest sites for
last). From my view, improvements to the current system are as follows:

(grouped in two categories - WP Core Dev changes, and Plugin Author
requirements)

1)Develop a core function to 'check' a plugin prior to install/activation to
ensure that the plugin cleans up after itself (mostly in the area of any DB
changes they might make, since we don't have to worry about plugins editing
core files). If it doesn't have a "compliant" 'remove_me' function disallow
activation. This places the responsibility for these types of issues with
the plugin authors rather than WP system devs. Ditto for autoupdate, version
check, and a wp-security check (to be sure things like current_user_can are
implemented). 
2)I know that computerguru has done some work in the past week or so on the
'autoupdate' system, so that's handled. 
3) slight re-vamp to requirements for a 'public' release of a plugin via
either the codex repo or wp-plugins.net, require plugins to have it's own
directory called plugin_name, and includes all plugin files, plus an
install.txt and readme.txt with at least a minimalist amount of
documentation on use and installation. 
4)a 'deactivate_all_plugins' function for use during WP core
uptates/upgrades.  this could either be a plugin itself or part of core - (I
wrote a perl script to do this for me directly against the DB for my own
purposes since I had to upgrade a bunch of sites)
5) a *warning* notification so that if someone is about to install or
activate a plugin that will function but doesn't comply with the 'standard'
at least they're aware that they're about to use something that's
*unsupported*
6) an updated set of requirements and guidelines for plugin authors which
explains how to structure and 'release' a 'supported' plugin (whether it be
via the actual wp repository or their own site).

Before deactivation of a plugin on an upgrade, it should check if the plugin
has user defined options with it and store them before activation. So,
if/when the user decides to reactivate the plugin, their settings aren't
lost.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Ajax Categories Admin Plugin
Message-ID: <d9b01a0608051018q505d8aben6dbef2f416178d7a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I wasn't sure if there was a specific convention for for submitting
new plugins, but here's one I've been working on:

http://uwmike.com/wordpress/wp-cats/

It's fairly simple in both code and presentation, but having ajax-y
controls for quickly adding and removing categories is quite useful,
especially if you've got a backlog of uncategorized posts.

It's been developed on WP 2.0.4 and FF/Mac, with checks on FF/Win and
IE/Win; I'd be curious to hear from people who've tried it on
different versions/browsers.

Mike

In WordPress? Most, if not all, of the user options are in the database
_options table. These don't get removed as far as I know when you deactivate
a plugin, so it's still there when you reactivate it.

Unless the deactivation hooks clean up, as they possibly should,

Not many plugins that I've used have done that... often I disable a plugin
for debugging and then reactivate it -- all settings still there.

What use would a cleanup be then, if WordPress was just going to store 
everything you delete from the database... in the database?

Sounds like there needs to be a differentiation between simple deactivation 
(still there, could turn it back on) and permanent removal/uninstall (no 
options left behind, no files..).  I >don't< think that deactivation should 
cause ANYTHING to be removed from DB or FS... needs to be a different 
'button', procedure, whatever.

I noticed this back when we were discussing the security holes in 2.0.3.
At the time, I figured it was a deliberate setting.  The lists used to
be pretty much live right?  Until that discussion, I'd always found the
articles I was seeking online when I looked for them.  In fact, I'd sent
an email to Matt requesting that the posts get a link to their place on
the list added before they are redistributed to everyone.  But that
wouldn't be practicle with a week worth of lag...

My new plugin autoupdate system does just that.
There is "Activate" and opposite it "Install" and then "Devactivate"
and "Uninstall"

Install goes through the entire install routines of creating files and
propogating the DB, uninstall deletes the same files and removes DB
data. Activate/Decactivate simply doesn't load the plugin.

I'm not seeing August 2006, period.. for hackers and testers lists.. Sent 
the same email to both of them, and didn't get replies to either.. which 
you'd usually think atleast one person would have replied.. =/

But, still haven't seen August 2006 for either lists.. so I can't tell if it 
made it through to both or not either.. =/  I even tried resubscribing to 
wp-testers, and just received the message, you're already a member to the 
list.. Also tried, clearing cache for both IE and FF browsers... no 
difference.. So, I dunno what's going on.. =(

Message-ID: <a491f91d0608051500i4de9ae11ma9b5b6f45139d3e1@mail.gmail.com>

I believe I have found part of the cause of the 2.0.4 performance
issues complaints. Somewhere between 2.0.3 and 2.0.4, we did something
that calls get_post tens to hundreds of times depending on the number
of pages when viewing a page with a permalink. This is now completely
reproducable, and is a serious concern as I have one client who is
getting in excess of 300 database queries per page view.

I haven't yet found the core cause of the issue, but to reproduce,
make sure you have a decent amount of pages (say at least 20 or so),
and fancy permalinks enabled, and likely some sort of menu listing the
pages on the sidebar (I believe this is where the issue is, the new
page walking code perhaps?). You should notice a considerable spike in
query usage, I haven't had a chance to dig around more, but the rest
of you are welcome to do so, imho this is big enough where it needs to
be fixed and maybe even one last release on the 2.0.x series before
2.1, as this could cause shared hosts to ban users easily for
hammering the db server

My gmail account is showing the email I just received from spencerp is
23hours ago, but threaded between Brian Layman (1.5hrs ago) and Rob Miller
(4mins ago)

Something is wonky to say the least.

wp-testers and wp-hackers list archives.. notice August 2006 isn't even 
there in either one.. =/  Just last one is July 2006

The other times are fine, I think. Brian's last reply shows up at 00:01 
for me, yours as 1:51 and the current time is ~2:15 (all BST). It's just 
spencer that's being thrown out of whack---for me at least.

I've noticed (and while this is unrelated, there's some discussion
about it) that over the past few days, all the mailing lists have been
behind a bit, as in e-mails don't go through immediately sometimes and
I'll get a whole batch of e-mails within a few minutes that span a few
hours worth of mails. Possibly just mail server issues on this
specific bit.

Hmmm...  this  raises even more questions... I have been  on
this  list  since  2004 as far as I can recall.  Is  Mailman
improperly configured or is this intentional?

I'm not talking about deactivation, in terms of cleanup, but rather
"uninstall", currently to uninstall a plugin you can deactivate it, then
delete the plugin file[s]/directory, but there's no database cleanup. That
should be the responsibility of the plugin author via an "uninstall"
function. What's the point in keeping useless information in the database if
a plugin is removed ? the other 'function' which I mentioned was a
'deactivate_all_plugins' which would be used during something like a WP core
upgrade (and should likely be a wp core function, or a plugin on it's own)
that wouldn't need to (or shouldn't make any changes to the DB as more than
likely the plugins would be re-activated following an upgrade.

What if you deactivate a plugin, then want to reactivate it after an
upgrade, but keep all the settings the same?  Wouldn't cleaning out the DB
on deactivation erase those settings.  UTW comes to mind as having numerous
settings.

I think Mr. Christopher means that there should be one subroutine for simply "deactivating" the pluging without deleting something from the database or the filesystem (just removing it from the loop), and one subroutine for a "clean and sweep", which purges settings and data belonging to that plugin. 

Imho deleting the files from the filesystem could be somewhat cumbersome because of all the different system setups out there...

The "clean and sweep"-button could be implemented in the plugins-page, in addition to the activate/deactivate buttons.

Give that man a cigar! Thanks to your use case, I've exposed what must
be considered a performance issue in WP_Query::get_posts() - the search
for a single page id by name is linear, calling get_page() each
iteration until the desired page is found. On a shared site with a
significant number of pages, that could grind.

O, what was that? Is that...really? 2.0.5 If this gets fixed quickly, a
2.0.5 should be released.

There's an idea for a plugin maybe.  Go through your MySQl tables and
delete the tables (or at least note them) and the _options lines that
are are longer needed.

That code was in 2.0.  It's been there awhile.  I agree that it is 
inefficient, which is why it is gone from 2.1.  It's not something that 
changed between 2.0.3 and 2.0.4 though.

There's actually an issue in get_all_page_ids(), right at line 379.
posts.pages_status is not indexed.  So, the DB has to recall and examine
every post record each time it is called.  That's GOT to take a long
time on older blogs.

Paul, I'd be curious to find out how much improvement you see after
running this statement on your DB:
ALTER TABLE `YOURPREFIX_posts` ADD INDEX `post_status` ( `post_status` )


Adding that index should speed up RSS feeds, pings, the post page,
inline uploading, Previous and next post navigation, and several other
places as well.  It should radicaly reduce the load on the DB too.
Post_status is used in enough where clauses that it SHOULD have a
non-unique index on it.  It is used sometimes with ID but I don't know
enough about mysql's query engine's inner workings to know if a joint
index would perform any better than two separate indexes.  

post_author isn't used in as nearly as many places, mostly in the admin
pages as I see it, but it might be worth adding that too.  It would
speed up getting the get_posts call when getting the list of posts the
user is allowed to edit.

Has anyone done an analysis of the Select statements recently to see if
the needed indexes all exist?

I don't think my original message came through:

The new plugin autoupdate and installation framework addresses most of these
issues raised in this thread in one form or the other. It allows for
install/uninstall routines that are separate from activate/deactivate, and
deal with everything from file creation to database propogation.

I've contacted Ryan about what I've got so far, I still haven't received a
reply yet, but it's shaping up beautifully. The code is very
straight-forward and simple, but it's _very_ flexible and can go a long
way... I'm trying to make the interface as simple as possible but trying my
best not to limit dev innovation or stifle 'creative' install/uninstall
routines.

Yeah, it's not all that serious anyway, less so if 2.1 replaces it. I
stumbled upon it looking for something, anything, that could cause a
slowdown after an upgrade. I've put considerable effort into finding
such a thing now, alas, still coming up empty.

Did the added index make any difference in the total time?  How many
posts do you have in your test DB?

Would this have *any* bearing on my 70+ second WRITE PANEL loads? Any time I
want to create a new post or edit an old one I run into this. Was like this
late 2.0.3, thru 2.0.4 and now in 2.1 alpha.

Also guessing, I doubt it. It's such a light regex, and not called often
enough to make a noticeable difference, I'd say.

It was already there on yours?

Odd, it wasn't on mine... I only had PRIMARY and post_name...

Oh, great... You're right, it is there on 3 other blogs I have running
out of that same DB, but it is missing from the code cave...  GREAT, now
I have to check all of the tables...

Yeah, it seems I'm missing secondary indexs on many of the tables...
That's really odd.  I've only ever done the normal upgrade process with
this site.  

Well, I'll have to rebuild them...  Good news is that I should get some
better performance...

Acutally, it can be called a positively stupid number of times, but I 
too doubt that it makes a big difference.  I can't think of any other 
performance affecting changes that went in though.

>Already there.
Actually, this is somewhat revealing...

I just created another site from the 2.04 install and it only has the
PRIMARY and post_name indices/indexes in that DB too.

According to upgrade-schema.php, you are only suppose to have KEY and
post_name:
CREATE TABLE $wpdb->posts (
  [A BUNCH OF FIELDS]
  PRIMARY KEY  (ID),
  KEY post_name (post_name)
);


However, in upgrade-functions.php, the 'post_status' index is added as
part of function upgrade_101().
	// Clean up indices, add a few
	add_clean_index($wpdb->posts, 'post_name');
	add_clean_index($wpdb->posts, 'post_status');
	add_clean_index($wpdb->categories, 'category_nicename');
	add_clean_index($wpdb->comments, 'comment_approved');
	add_clean_index($wpdb->comments, 'comment_post_ID');
	add_clean_index($wpdb->links , 'link_category');
	add_clean_index($wpdb->links , 'link_visible');
It seems upgrade_101 is not called when a new DB is create because the
version is already 3440.

All of those other indices have been moved over to the schema file but
post_status has not.  Now in my wife's blog, her db has a number of
others, but I don't know how many of these are thanks to plugins...

Keyname Type Cardinality Action Field 
PRIMARY  PRIMARY  749       ID  
post_date  INDEX  749       post_date  
post_date_gmt  INDEX  749       post_date_gmt  
post_name  INDEX  749       post_name  
post_status  INDEX  4       post_status  
autometa  FULLTEXT  749       post_content  
post_title  
 
It makes me wonder if people who have followed the upgrade paths have
any other indices/indexes that a person who straight installed a version
does not have....

Good catch.  Maybe we can add the key we've been using in 2.1.

It  was definitely out-of-sync yesterday. Somehow it catched
up, with or without intervention (I can't think of an option
that  enables  this  [1]). FWIW, I noticed  that  very  same
behaviour   some  time  on  the  past   (consistent   across
Automattic  mailing lists). Symptoms: the archives lose that
regular  pace;  there  is lag on the mailing lists;  and  on
several  occasions there are downtimes too (last one  around
April-May).

Unless  you  run  some special plug-in  or  extension  (e.g.
FasterFox),  it's  hard to believe that HTTP headers from  a
/live/ archive will not expire cache immediately. Now that I
check   this  for  versification,  I  notice  an  amusing  X
header...

Roy, Yep..I have the FasterFox extenstion for FireFox. =) But, I find it odd 
though, because I did the hard clear of cache in IE6 too, and had same 
result.. =/

I didn't get a chance just yet, to redo the Hard Clear of Cache, been taking 
care of WordPress installation requests at the Install4free blog and so 
forth. I'll will try again here, in a few minutes though.. ;) =)

Message-ID: <a491f91d0608071024u796ed8afq443879c1a59c2b46@mail.gmail.com>

As we grow nearer to the 2.1 release, I feel the need to bring this
topic up once again. I think that we need a new default theme for WP
2.1. Not only is that a nice new feature to list, but for people who
are new to WordPress, we need a theme that can be easily modified via
CSS, something that users can actually learn from, instead of the mess
that Kubrick (and Kubrick 2 even more) is.

I think we need to include a theme without the silly fixed-width image
basis that Kubrick currently has. There are countless questions on how
to change background colors, how to change the width of the default
theme, and they are questions that nobody wants to answer because
kubrick is a mess and a pain to customize. So basically, we need an
XHTML and CSS compliant theme that makes sense, semantically as well
as to someone new to CSS trying to customize it.

Right now, I have no particular theme in mind, and so I ask you all
for your opinion on replacing Kubrick as the default theme as well as
what the replacement should be.

To me, that thread is an entirely different discussion, on how to make
a theme that should not go into the core. Its an interesting concept,
no doubt, but I have doubts as to how complete it will be, and I think
that the whole thing is too much bloat for the core.

Well, we could always use a simple theme that is already out there. Maybe
something like a customized Minimalist Sandbox theme?

Scott and Andy have put a lot of work into that theme, and we're 
featuring it on wordpress.com for use with the CSS editor.  I think it 
would make a swell default for end-users, tweakers, and designers. 
Whether it should go into 2.1, I'm not sure.  I would like to get that 
release out some day. :-)

I'm not a fan of Kubrick as a default theme either, but the real issue for a
beginning theme maker isn't the issue of background images or fixed widths,
it's the learning curve on the (WP) code.  IHMO, until a group of coders and
designers join forces to write a theme that is up-to-date in clean,
commented code, with simple semantic markup, there's no sense in changing
the "default" theme.

I came into both XHTML and WP at the introduction of 1.5, and thus Kubrick,
and all my learning came from dissecting that.  It's both a great starting
point, as well as a hindrance, again, IMO, but people will find fault with
most themes.

I'd be 100% committed to collaborating with others to take on such an
endeavor, and would love to see the skills of some one like Phu Ly involved,
as well as Mark Jaquith.  No slight to anyone else not mentioned.

Just my 2?.

I too cut my CSS (and my PHP) teeth on Kubrick and I have to say it was
not a good experience but it was a good learning curve. But spend a few
days reading the support forum and the peculiarities of Kubrick seem to 
cause much pain. It is a mess and it is too idiosyncratic for the average
user. As an old software developer I could cope but for every one of me
there are many, many more who can't. I've argued before that making the
default a more simple and straightforward theme should help both newbies
and the support team.

And that's just my 2 cents as well!

I think that using the Sandbox theme would be nice. Might be a critical-mass
kind of thing, plus you could potentially ship with a couple of different
CSS styles, if you're really trying to reach for the stars. Is the Sandbox
used on Wordpress.com released yet? (http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/)
If/when that happens, maybe a couple of people would like to work on some
custom css with me? I'm thinking you could even have a CSS switcher plugin
(al-la k2 schemes)...?

I've not used the sandbox theme yet, but it's my understanding that there's
an options page.  From a support standpoint, that's going to open up a whole
new can of worms that the the forums wouldn't be able to handle (as it is,
heavy code questions often go un answered).  Seriously, I can already here a
new users asking "how can I add an option to..."

If I'm mistaken about the sandbox theme, then perhaps it's worth looking at.

Not to be a parade-rainer or anything, but the out-of-the-box Sandbox
theme looks polly-wolly crappy.  I mean, seriously, what are we,
Texpattern? *grin*

I think a nifty idea might be to ship a Sandbox config with a Kubrick
scheme predefined - make a WP 2.2+ blog look exactly like 2.0, only with
nifty semantic markup powering the beast.

Then, its up to us to write good documentation on it. It could always be
taken off of the release version. As I said 'modified' version.

Indeed.  It's a concept I've had since I went through the tutorial from
Urban Giraffe that strips Kubrick down (removes the background images for
one).  I have a "blank" theme that basically takes that tutorial and the
stripped down templates, and a style sheet with all the divs and classes,
but without any of the actual style.  I've gotten some good feedback on my
blog from it, and think an updated version would be very useful to new
users.

I think it would be a mistake to approach this from the perspective of 
how much a user knows about html, css or php. I'd suggest placing more 
weight on what's out there, what's popular now, and just how different 
will that be from the new "Default" theme?

I think we made this mistake once with Kubrick, and now we're in the
mess that this thread is trying to fix.

I think I agree with you on principle. Kubrick is a real bastard to work
with if you're a rookie.  But therein lies the problem. Now we've gopne from
producing compliant code, efficient code, ease of _use_ and moved into a
realm of holding peoples hands thus complicating the mission of WordPress. I
don't know that it's our role to _teach_ people how to write good CSS and
XHTML, and I know that's not what you're saying, but by making sure people
can do this stuff without having a learning curve places us more in the
realm of SitePoint.

I'm of the opinion that there should be a new default theme for every major
release as it not only keeps things fresh but marks our territory. I think
coming to a consensus on what it's going to be, if existing, is going to be
hard. Obviously Doug doesn't like Sandbox because it's too much like
Textpattern. I love it because it is like Textpattern. :) I almost think
something like that should just be commissioned to some designer outside of
this circle.

But then I'm just talking.

I'm not of the mind that a new release should have a new "snazzy" theme as
default simply because of it's aesthetics, rather that the default theme
should be a solid building block for new users of WordPress.  I'm more of
the mind the default theme should be a bit vanilla.

I agree that attempting to teach CSS and XHTML within the theme is the wrong
approach, rather the WP code should be in it's most current state, and
clearly and heavily commented.  I'm also of the mind that the the markup
should be semantic, but also written in a manner that a beginner can
follow.  I think that would eliminate some headaches in the support forums,
and it would allow someone with either the skills, or adventure, to
customize and create their own look.

~miklb

As stated, I'm 100% committed to joining forces with anyone interested in
creating such a theme.

Sandbox isn't meant to be an out-of-the-box pretty-wowee-zowee theme. 
It's meant to be a wow-cool-lookidat skeleton, on top of which you can 
build your own pretty theme.

I just downloaded Sandbox earlier today, and it already comes with a 
predefined Kubrick look-alike skin.

I fully understand Ryan's comment about not trying to squeeze a new 
default theme into WP 2.1. But I would definitely be in favor of basing 
a future default theme on Sandbox, with some pre-prettified skins 
bundled in.

Well it depends on who we're aiming it at, I guess; there are themes 
like Sandbox, self-professed "themes for themers" that are beautiful 
markup-wise but not visually, and there are themes that might not be the 
best markup-wise but are beautiful looking.

We could combine the two---having the default theme be a modification of 
Sandbox, for example---but, like Ryan says, aiming for 2.1 might be a 
little soon.

Well, which is it?  Incomplete, or too bloated?   :^)

Seriously, the theme I'm working on is for the average user.  If it isn't elegant and tight I certainly wouldn't use it or expect anyone else to.

A "theme for themers" (as Rob put it) is a very worthwhile thing for theme /developers/, but not for theme /users/.  Today you have to be a web development super-genius to get a WordPress blog that looks unique, and that shouldn't be the case.

Both. Not that it won't make a great plugin, but its just too much for the core.

I definitely think that making the default theme in 2.1 a Kubrick-styled 
Sandbox would be a good idea. Retain the same visuals, but make it much 
easier for users to customise things.

I wish I'd know about Sandbox a fortnight ago before I made a theme from 
scratch :(

Sorry for the self-reply, I hit send by accident.

The thing about a theme to customize itself with colors and this and
that is that, when a user wants to make their theme truly unique by
breaking out of what the theme can do, we have a whole new support
issue on our hands, one that the support forums and probably half the
people on this list can't or won't stand to deal with. This theme runs
us into the same problem that Kubrick 2 in the core would, if you want
to do more than what CSS can do to the theme, change how the XHTML is
structurally, you have to swim through a jungle of mess and code, and
the way I see it there simply isn't a way to keep this theme as
customizable as it can be while maintaining the ability for the them
to make sense to an ordinary user when they try to edit it. So, like I
said before, great idea for a plugin/customizable theme, poor idea for
the core.

Can I ask why everyone says to maintain the same visuals?
Am I the only one that thinks Kubrick is a design nightmare?... no offense, but it's just so in-your-face, I dunno....

And the too-thin margins..

What is the goal being discussed?  A default theme that users can simply
modify via an options page or add "skins", or a theme that is clean and
solid at the core, with markup that's easy to follow and organized so as to
be able to learn and understand the theme system?

I hate it too, but now that I've said that, I'll doubtlessly hear the
endless "you just want it gone cause you don't like how it looks"
flac. Not true, so please don't even argue with me about it, I already
stated my reasons.

I've always thought that to. Thats why I never kept the default theme!

Bing.

Structually, I think Sandbox needs a little more burn-in, but it has the 
potential to provide a very stable and learnable structure for CSS 
artists post-2.1. I think the Kubrick "skin" for sandbox is a pretty 
cool demonstration. We should all take a look at it and try to break it, 
and work together with Scott and Andy to make it as robust as possible.

I would suggest anyone developing a new theme try to build it on top of 
Sandbox. If it doesn't work, share why.

Visually, a new default could provide some nice spice for new users. 
It's not really worth discussing the aesthetics of it because we'll 
never all agree, it's just going to be something I'll make a call on.

I don't see how any "theme" with it's own built in template tags makes sense
as a default theme.  Especially from a support stand point.

I'm not arguing on the quality of work in Sandbox, I'm simply trying to find
out what the ultimate goal is, a default theme that's for an experienced
coder and "CSS artist" or my mom when she wants to change a few colors and a
header image.

I'd choose my words with more care if I were you Rob.

That said, I've always wondered why there has been little to no
updating going on for Kubrick since it got into WP, it sure could use
it.

Maybe we can somehow include a simple editor, specific for the template.
Like Kubrick can do with the header, but this would be much more expansive
in terms of what you can do. It would have something that says Right Navbar
Color: <color palette here> and stuff like that.

The latter is my intent, but something with skins won't be so bad as
IF and only IF if follows the latter guidelines. Inevitably no set of
stylesheets or customization through the admin panel will meet the
needs of every user, and if we put crap behind the options page or
skins, we've solved nothing.

Ironically, most of the people complaining about Kubrick/K2 on this
list are not the "average" WP user. Google doesn't show a lot of
people publicly complaining about K2. Infact, a lot of people really
like the default theme. And there's no doubt that Kubrick became the
trademark of WP blogs (there are Kubrick clones for Drupal, bloxom and
pretty much everything else these days).

Nothing against the current discussion really, but I don't see any
need for beating down on Kubrick like this.

I didn't say people don't like it, and I didn't say people complain
about the look. But its when you spend time on IRC or browse the
support forum that you see the hundreds of requests for "how do I do
this with the default theme" with answers that you could write a book
about because it is a structural mess. The standard response on IRC
now for how to change colors on your Kubrick theme is simply "find
another theme and save yourself some time and trouble".

For all I care, we could remove the heavy reliability on images from
Kubrick, make it semantically correct and sensible and keep it as the
default, but at this point I think it'd be easier to use something
already out there like Sandbox.

Just for the record, I'm not beating it down. All I'm saying is if we make a
new theme, we don't _have_ to make it look like Kubrick and IMO it
shouldn't. New should be new through and through, not just the backend. 

Nothing is perfect and whether or not you like Kubrick you can't deny that
there is always room for improvement... No need to get into a war because
it's not worth it and it won't accomplish anything, you can't change the
original Kubrick, but all we can do is work hard to make the next theme the
best ever yet.

Right now, the problem is that any significant degree of WordPress theme customization requires that users start wrangling with CSS and XHTML.

My goal is that 80% of users can make the theme customizations that they want without hitting that CSS/XHTML wall.  There's no reason such a theme can't be elegant and tight.

I'm not asking you to agree with me, but I would like you to keep an open mind at least until you see it.   :^)

What is the best way to share your thoughts and ideas?

Actually there is no efficient way of delivering a message to the highest
number of interested users. 
This same message is the proof of the existence of the problem, in fact, it
has been sent on this mailing list/forum but it was meant to reach a higher
audience of interested people.

Agoraki tries to solve the problem.

Agoraki is system which aids the one-to-many communication, coordinating all
the single blogs, forums, mails and mailing list which are scattered all over
the Internet.

Agoraki, in its essence, is a semantic routing system which delivers a message
to the highest number of nodes interested to the message itself.

Right now, Agoraki is just an idea. You can find its full description on
Idiki: http://idiki.dyne.org/wiki/Agoraki


That's all,
spread the idea and happy hacking ^_^

I think this is a great idea. The k2 idea of "schemes" was really really
cool, and I'm imagining a world where there's a WP foundation that could be
used to build a CSS Zen Garden esque gallery of themes. This would help the
problem of WP themes needing security audits, etc, which was an issue for
Alex King's Theme Browser, I know. Sharing CSS is pretty easy, and having a
standard-ish base to build on sounds really exciting.

Is anyone out there working on a k2-lite theme for Sandbox? I'm thinking
that might be a good project for me.

If the user isn't going to edit CSS or HTML, how are they going to make any
changes? Is this going to be a plugin-based thing where you can change the
header image from the wp-admin or something like that?

Yep, there'll be a fancy-pants options page.

You can start that and report what you have to the list. It shouldn't be
that hard.

Not to be mean, or rude or anything.. but, like the others said though, it's 
a mess for the "noobs" when first starting out though..sigh. (I personally 
don't mind the default theme myself...though. =)  )

After tons and tons of support requests through the forums on how to fix 
that 1px footer/header shift.. how to add their own header images... how to 
adjust the fonts for the content, the links and so forth.. OMFG.. it's 
tiresome.. but, "we" were still helping them with it though..

It was just before the release of 2.0.4 that the 1px header/footer shift was 
fix.. and months and months before that.. "we/I/someone else/" came up with 
a "fix" for it.. and a few other things too.

To make this display issue(s).. go bye bye.. =)  Thank God though, that this 
is "fixed" now, and will display nicely in IE6, IE7, Firefox and Opera.. ;) 
I actually enjoyed working with it, and made up variations of it even lol.

But again, it's just too much though.. for the "noobs/new users/ " getting 
that theme by default.. and tinkering with it "out of the box" ....so to 
speak..  Also, like the other said.. I'm all for another WordPress "default" 
theme, if it might help cut down on numerous repeated support questions.. 
like sadly..the default 1.5 theme had done already..

"We/the new users"  need something a little more simplified, to just "go to 
town on"..if they want too..  ;)  =)  Not really saying, to totally scratch 
off the default 1.6 theme though.. maybe have that in there yet, like the 
Classic maybe.. give them a few various themes to tinker with if need be..

What ever theme you guys/gals agree on, will be fine with me.. =)  Again, 
the Default theme isn't *really* a bad theme at all.. I enjoyed working on 
it, and learning from it.. =)

I said that on the other discussion going on that Matt started. It might
require some hefty coding, but the UE will be better in the end.

Yes, and please let me know when you've got it ready, Trevor. I'm thinking
of how to best put together a place for Sandbox skins, whether it be a wiki
or just a lazy <ul> on the theme page. Let's see.

I've made a couple of simple skins already. You have a place setup?

All-in-all, I like the idea of using the sandbox theme, and I think it
meets what my original idea was, especially since we can throw a
beautiful looking CSS file over top of the XHTML, and we have a theme
that makes sense. Teaching new users to customize there theme from
there is teaching them basic CSS, not hacking around an image based
theme.

+1 for the inclusion of Sandbox.

The "Theme for the rest of us" is a great idea, but like I said
before, I strongly oppose any such thing being core and default.
Here's why:

First, if you really want it to be as customizable as possible, the
whole thing will be laced with PHP. The CSS files will be generated by
PHP. To mess with 1 vs 2 vs 3+ column layouts that involves more PHP.
To customize even further than that, its more PHP. Kubrick 2 is the
perfect example of this, the code behind it is a mess (Yes, I said it
again.). The fact that our templates use <?php function(); ?> style
"template tags" has already recieved complaints from PHP-afraid web
designers.

What this all means is that when a user wants to add a custom
template, or do some significant change that involves editing the
theme files instead of what even the most powerful options panel is
limited to, we have a support nightmare on our hands. The XHTML and
CSS might be better than Kubrick is now, but it'll open a whole new
can of support problems, as [sorry in advance for anyone who is
offended by this] the vast majority of support forum volunteers, even
the most active ones, know little or no PHP at all, and the minute a
user wonders what is doing what, they'll go to the forums or IRC
(We've already proven we can't document things well enough, so no we
can't just document it).

I hate to make it sound like I'm dumping on the idea of this theme or
even K2. Both are great in concept, and great for the few users who
are satisfied with a few options in the admin panel, and they
definitely have their place...outside the core.

-1 for the inclusion of whatever this shall be titled.

Not yet, but it seems the winds are blowing in the direction of the Codex,
which is probably best. Please feel free to send them along to me directly.
I'll share the details of the page as soon as I have it together. A little
content makes writing it much easier. ;-)

Thanks,

scott

I'm working on a k2 port, but I've noticed a couple of issues. Is
there a better place than this list to post issues? The first one is
the classes generated for posts has a gap in there, which could cause
problems with browsers (?):

class="hentry  publish author-admin category-uncategorized y2006 m08 d07 h06">

See the gap between hentry and publish? I'm not sure if it would
matter, or if it's fixable, but I thought it worth mentioning.

WP's built-in CSS system already supports CSS-only themes. I don't think 
every theme should recreate their own scheme and UI for that. All it 
needs is this in its style.css:

/*
Template: sandbox
*/

Yes, email them to me or Andy directly. We have a repo set up for the
Sandbox so we can keep track of bugs. I'm afraid issues might get lost of a
listserv or detract from any issue at hand.

For reference:

Angry about the Sandbox? Email complaints, suggestions, skins, et al, to
swallick@gmail.com.

I don't think it would, as browsers as far as I understand how they render
emtpy space, 1 = 492, so I'm not sure it matters.

All the same, there's no reason this little gap can't be zapped.

Zap.

Why is that?  Is it a done deal then that Sandbox is going to be the next
default theme?  Otherwise, they should simply be listed like anyother theme,
IMO, but not the "official" home of it.  My opinion, of course.  Otherwise,
any theme maker can start using the codex for their theme's home, unless
that's already allowed.

I've already  voiced my concern with making a theme default that has it's
own functions built in, but  it looks as if it's falling of deaf ears.

Please do not take that as a slight of the quality of work and forthought
that has gone into the theme, I think it's a great idea, just a support
forums nightmare.

Personally, I give the Sandbox theme a +1 for inclusion into the core.
At the very least, it would be a great replacement for the Classic
theme.

Now is it just me, does the internal Theme Editor only allow you edit
the main style.css and not whichever skin CSS file is active? I,
myself, do not use the Theme Editor and I'm sure not many on this list
do either, but I'm guessing LOTS of folks do though. If I'm not
missing something and this does indeed become core, the Theme Editor
will probably need some upgrading to support mutiple skins.

Regardless of whether or not the Sandbox becomes the next default or is
washed away by the sea, I think the pages on the Codex are as good a place
as any to keep documents for the Sandbox, especially considering its nature
on WordPress.com; however, I am totally up to suggestions.

I don't know if having a family of pages on the Codex would make it the
Sandbox "home" but then again this might just be the booze in me talking.

As someone who creates consumer-facing products for a living, you're coming at this exactly backwards.

You're pushing minimalist styles with zero-to-one options.  That may be fine for you, but most users aren't like you.  They don't have the CSS + XHTML + PHP skills to customize "themes for themers" like Sandbox, and /that's/ what causes support nightmares.

> To mess with 1 vs 2 vs 3+ column layouts that involves more PHP.

No, this can all be done reliably with CSS.  A "theme for users" will have more PHP than a "theme for themers", but the point is that the users who wouldn't understand it will never see it, and anyone who knows PHP will be fine with it.

We can agree to disagree, but please stop slagging non-minimalist themes.

Robert,

I  don't  mean  to  step on your toes,  but  this  had  been
discussed  in great depth over at the testers mailing  list.
This  discussion will most likely result in re-iteration  of
the same arguments.

Best wishes,

Roy

You can't make XHTML appear magically with CSS. And for the latter
bit, reread my last few e-mails. They clearly say that yes, this kind
of customization has its place and its time, but not in the core,
because anything distributed with the core is assumed to be supported,
and when a user can't do what they need to do with an admin panel,
they have to dive into the PHP mess of a theme.

> We can agree to disagree, but please stop slagging non-minimalist themes.

I clearly said they had their place and time. Because I don't think
they should go in the core doesn't mean I don't think its a great
idea. Hundreds of plugins are great ideas, but their place isn't in
the core either.

The default theme was no less difficult for people with little or no CSS and
PHP knowledge. Kubrick inspired a lot of people to learn how to do a lot of
things, and while it was reflective of one person's particular style and
design sense, it was, and is, no better or worse than 99% of the available
WordPress themes today.

Personally I think Sandbox should have its own infrastructure a la K2. It
needs more control than the wild wild west-ism of the Codex.

Yikes. Whoever said porting k2 onto Sandbox would be easy never looked
at the k2 CSS! I've had a couple of false starts, but here's my
progress so far:

http://www.almosteffortless.com/sandbox/wordpress/

I'm trying to take anything and everything I can out of the CSS so it
might be easier for a newbie to make sense out of.

Message-ID: <884fd7f10608080108j7fb1d281w952415075eea3a1b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

New to the list, and will likely be lurking most of the time.

I did find the following article today though, which I'd like to see
some discussion on:

http://jpipes.com/index.php?/archives/99-MySQL-Connection-Management-in-PHP-How-Not-To-Do-Things.html

The reason I post it here is that this guy specifically mentions
Wordpress in the article, and offers some 'patches' to 'fix' the
problem.  Apparently the fix will be posted to wp-testers (I'm not on
that mailing list...).

Anyway, the article basically goes on to say that a method called
"Lazy Loading" should be used to only create a connection to the mysql
database if a query is actually executed against the database.  With
the current way that wordpress works, that would be every single page
load.

I'm not going to summarise the article, go read for yourself. :-)

I'd just like to hear your opinion on what a possible performance hit
a change like he is suggesting (SqlConnection class, and/or content
caching...) would be on the wordpress engine...

Thanks

The patch doesn't look bad. I think something like this is already in 
the MU db class.

I noticed the new login image there, for the 2.1.. is the Shuttle *really*

upcoming future of the Shuttle?

I *really* wouldn't mind helping with this, if all possible though...but, if

It's possible some plugins use the wpdb class to connect to a  
different database with different username/password.  For backward  
compatibility in such a case (albeit edgy), we'd need to instantiate  
with the db constants rather than with the nicer looking no argument  
method that the patch [1] uses.

But that would mean storing the arguments passed to wpdb in some  
local variables, multiplying the number of places db username/ 
passwords are stored.  Good/Bad/Doesn't matter?

I don't want to sound too hopeful, but if all users actually took the
initiative to learn a little bit to help them make their own, we wouldn't be
in this mess. Unfortunately, most users think that we should do all the work
and stuff should just magically appear because they clicked a button. I
don't think it would be a bad idea to have some links to some CSS stuff in
the codex that basically says "What to edit your own template? Click here
for some instruction blablahblah..."

I don't think ALL of it will be implemented by 2.1. It will probably be
released over 2.2 and 2.5

Trevor:

A user on WordPress.com has put together a pretty good-looking Sandbox-mod
of a K2-mod, if that makes sense.

http://mirkwood.wordpress.com/

Just FYI. I don't think the source has been shared, but I like how the
#globalnav has been used for the horizontal page links.

I actually fail to see the point here entirely. With WordPress, we
_know_ for a fact we must query the database on every page load,
unless we have an Advanced Cache plugin, which dies before the wpdb
class is even loaded. I see no point whatsoever.

Thanks, Scott. I'll keep chugging along anyway, but I'll definately take a
look at Mirkwood for some of that code. I was wondering how I was going to
do that horizontal navigation!

Well one COULD argue that WPDB is an abstraction for JUST the WP database... 
that if you want to open another database, you should instantiate a 
different type of object (given WPDB now is more than just a generalized DB 
abstraction -- go grab the original wrapper/object code and use that 
instead...).

I guess I can see it being used to access a second WP database... but again, 
in THAT case you could instantiate another WPDB object.

How many plugins does this actually affect?

I don't think variables are any better or worse than constants. I think 
we just use constants for historical reasons.

I've made some progress in porting k2 to Sandbox. I'm just about done with
the home page, and starting to nibble at the rest. There's still a fair
chunk of work to go, actually, but some major progress has been made.

I think things are looking pretty good on IE and Firefox. I'll check Safari
when I get home. I'm taking a long route and porting all of the CSS over bit
by bit, so hopefully there would be less CSS there for Sandbox beginners to
worry about customizing if they wanted to use this as a base.

This is kind of fun for me because I've been thinking of making a "k2 lite"
for myself for a while. So, this is killing two birds with one stone, I
suppose.

If you're interested, have a look:

http://www.almosteffortless.com/sandbox/wordpress/
http://www.almosteffortless.com/sandbox/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sandbox/skins/2c-r-k2-tabs.css

This version shows the k2 style Tabs, which can be disabled just by turning
off the Global Navigation option in the CSS header. Thanks to Scott and the
guy that made mirkwood for that. It doesn't work just exactly like k2 given
the markup that Sandbox produces, but it's pretty close.

I'd welcome any suggestions at all from you CSS support gurus out there.

It doesn't mean that users are dumb or lazy because they expect this,
though.  It just means that they have high expectations because WordPress is
awesome, and it's a bit shocking to them to discover that theme editing
works more like writing PostScript than using Illustrator.

Thanks for your reply.. =) Atleast I got *one* lol! I think this is the main 
reason for cross posting to begin with.. figured I'd only get *one* good 
answer reply sigh.. =(

Oh well...I guess I deserve that .. [rolls eyes].. =/  I was kind of hoping 
that it might make it for 2.1 though..hasn't this been a year/or so project 
already.. ?  If it's a cosmetic thing..having people work on it, on the 
localhost would help speed things along.. but, like I said before.. if it's 
more a PHP coding/CSS type deal.. then I'm not so sure how I would be able 
to help.. =(

Subject: [wp-hackers] Convention on dieing from functions.
Message-ID: <a491f91d0608090044h735fe2eg12b0aaa739a64206@mail.gmail.com>

With a lot of the changes in trunk, wp_die() is becoming a nice new
way to lazy out of checking for error return values from a function by
simply dieing from inside the function. This raises a new issue for
plugin developers, as some of the functions that die out might
otherwise be useful to them. One instance is write_post(), which could
be a great function for plugins that need to insert a post into the
database without doing all the tedious error checking again
themselves. Unfortunately, for plugins that can't just let the script
die with the wp_die message on them while they're trying to insert the
post, its no longer usable.

I'm sure this isn't the only example, and so my question for hackers
is, should we establish a convention now for:
-Dieing out of functions due to errors
-How to return errors from functions
-etc?

Message-ID: <5aa3aa0608090633p3ffe734cx9d6b3427e01353d1@mail.gmail.com>

I am running 2.1 Alpha 2 but this issue started back with 2.0.3. This
morning I decided to export my WP content to an XML and import it into a new
database to see if that would fix up the increasing long load time for the
WRITE panel. BTW, my last load time was >163 seconds.

It turns out that my XML export file is over 39 MB in size, and I noticed
something right away when I opened it to have a look; starting on line 38 I
see the following:
<wp:postmeta>
<wp:meta_key>_utw_tags_0</wp:meta_key>
<wp:meta_value></wp:meta_value>
</wp:postmeta>

No big deal, right? EXCEPT...the above repeats SEVERAL HUNDRED TIMES PER
POST.

The above repeats from line 38 as stated through to line 2409.

YIKES!

Obviously I've deactivated the Ultimate Tag Warrior plugin, but that doesn't
get rid of the crap from my database.

As a follow-up, with masquerade's help (thanks, bud!) I deleted the UTW crap
from my DB. After running the SQL query, I got this:
Deleted rows: 370405 (Query took 60.3753 sec)

Yep, 370405 rows!

I just tested the load time on the WRITE panel and it's now 3.65 seconds.
For the record, I was running UTW version 3.14.

Wow. That's about all I know to say to that. Makes me very happy to

There's alot of really great resources out there for learning CSS/XHTML. As
a veteran of SitePoint, I recommend that you point people there. They are
ace in helping people learn a variety of web skills. Heck, that's where I
learned PHP, valid markup, CSS, aanmattering of other tools I use today.
Then I turned around and helped other people learn these skills too. Lots of
give and take.

I'm of the mind that WordPress can't (and should NOT) be all things to all
people). If users are impressed with the importance of learning these
skills, than support forums folks, IMHO, should be willing to put aces in
their places and let places like SPF do what they do best, while the WP
support people do what they do best in providing support for the software of
WordPress.

Um, yes, but who's talking about editing php.ini here, or did I miss that
comment somewhere. Server settings and valid markup/styling are two
different animals. Besides, ini_set() works well for many of the
php.inisettings so users don't actually have to know  (have access to)
 anything
about the php.ini file

My 2cents.

There's a whole lot of people who could care less about becoming web developers, even if they didn't have professions and families that got in the way.  Sad but true.

Right now a popular point of view on this list seems to be that WordPress users must be web developers in order to do interesting things.  That's like saying that everyone who drives are car must be a mechanic -- good advice in 1914, but maybe a little archaic now.

True, but we ARE talking about making it ewasy for users to customize their
themes. Whether sandboxing it or making a new Kubrick that is easier to
modify. How do you get away from web development? It's a web software with
web techniques and web benefits. I don't think referring somebody to a
different resource means they have to become web developers. In fact,
XHTML/CSS is intertwined with just "doing what we do" everyday in blogging.

Message-ID: <E62CF291-C3E1-4B7D-89CA-D452C590FA4F@birdhouse.org>

Hi all -

Great multi-user, multi-blog, multi-domain capabilities have always   
been  one of Movable  Type's biggest strengths over  WordPress.  WP- 
MU and Lyceum add these  capabilities to WordPress (it seems that  
Lyceum does so in a smarter way,  without creating a new set of  
tables for  each new  blog).

Not having followed its development, I'm curious why Lyceum is  
basically a WP fork. Why weren't these  capabilities simply  added to  
WordPress? For those of us working in education, large organizations,  
and hosting businesses, it would be a huge boon to be able to have  
just ONE WP installation, without having to deploy forked projects   
that might not stay current  with WP trunk.

I'm sure there are good reasons for the forks. What are they?

http://lyceum.ibiblio.org/
http://mu.wordpress.org/

Thanks,
Scot

I'm jumping in late, but I'm guessing the original intent was a "Admin Panel 
Configured" simple theme.  That is, you don't need to know CSS (or really 
HTML).  You pick options from an admin screen.  Color choices, font 
selection, sidebars, widgets, whatever.  Not getting into whether the admin 
screen is wysiwyg, ajax, etc., it could certainly be populated with enough 
control that someone who has no clue about CSS (again, or html) could have a 
shot at a slightly-personalized blog. ;)

This is similar in notion to my CG-FlashyTitles plugin -- which creates PHP, 
JS, and CSS snippets inline into the output, in order to 'hook in' sIFR 
flash font replacement.  Meaning the user doesn't need to know PHP, JS, or 
CSS to use it.  Also means they don't EDIT any PHP or CSS files (basically).

Agreed. I've gotten the feeling from developers in #wordpress that  
most WP users are end users uploading their blogs to a hosting site  
via ftp.  Moving away from fixed directory structures (the location  
of wp-content for example) have been met with either silence or just  
simply unpopular. Thanks for bringing this to light, now I know I'm  
not alone.

Btw, I've (successfully) transformed WP into a multiple blog format  
(I have multiple tables for each blog, but it can easily be  
configured for different databases).All the modifications can be  
implemented at the plugin level, with the exception of theme  
validating which unfortunately is still an existing trac (#2747).

WPMU stays current with WP trunk.  The two are synced with each other 
regularly.

They are better able to serve their purpose as forks.

OK... I think my k2 port for Sandbox is just about done. If anybody is
interested, I would love some feedback. I think the CSS could use a little
tidying up, but I'm pretty sure I covered just about everything (comments,
trackbacks, blockquotes, subpages, etc)...

Please have a look and let me know what you think:

http://www.almosteffortless.com/sandbox/wordpress/

You can snag the CSS from here for now:

http://www.almosteffortless.com/sandbox/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sandbox/skins/2c-r-k2-tabs.css

I'm going to clean things up a bit, but I've made a real effort to keep the
CSS to a minimum, and I don't use any hacks for IE, etc. I'm hoping that
this might make for a decent foundation for those wanting to use Sandbox,
who'd like to start out with some nice k2-ish look and feel.

Feel free to use the CSS for whatever you like, if you'd like. It's all GPL
and whatnot, of course. Did I mention - thanks to the people behind Sandbox
and the people behind k2. I think they're both pretty "boss" Wordpress
projects. (I just saw American Graffiti last night).

I'll put a post up on my blog when I'm all done anyway...

I've accidentally tripped over some issues which seem like they're pretty
serious. I'm not going to make a Dr Dave style blog post, because 1) it's
not the type of thing which should create mass hysteria and 2) it's not so
much related to security in the way some of those issues were. What I'd like
to do (and I don't normally like being this cryptic) is find some way for
those of you involved with the core development as well as plugin authors to
establish a means of discussing the issues I've come across, in possible a
less public venue than either the wp- mailing lists or via opening a trac
ticket. Matt/Ryan/Podz et. al.  most importantly, I'd like to get a little
feedback from all of you with regards to how you'd like me to
address/proceed with these items (note, I've also tested with a couple of
nightly builds of various versions, and the issues are pretty generic, and
so seem to affect all versions equally. 

Please advise..

Well said, Charles.

I am a hobbyist with WordPress. I am no coder. The modifications made to
my site are a result either of very clearly documented changes that a
simpleton like me could follow or begging coder friends to help out.

While I am interested in learning to code/use CSS/XHTML/whatever, my
profession and commitments do not permit me the time to do so.
Therefore, I am interested in extremely well-documented modifications,
or, even better, Options pages that do most of it for me.

I think it's been proven before that coders do not make good documentors.
Tons of options will make for a better UE probably, but then, having all
those options my cause it to get complicated....more so than it was before.

I can deal with complicated if it's well-documented and understandable.

I've done documentation for several large projects (including Xaraya and
PostNuke, among several other non-OS projects), so I understand the
difficulty and value to good documentation.

+1 from me. That's what I'm hoping this turns out, too.

Yep, plus the new version I'm working on uses sIFR3, along with Flash 8, to 
reduce the number of elements needed in the admin interface, and add support 
for 'plug-in style' effect filters.  Say, drop shadows, or knockouts, etc. 
It's very cool, and I'd love to get it into a theme or two as a 
built-in/shipped-with plugin.

Definitely feel free to drop me an email offline if you want to take the 
whole discussion off-list -- I'm always interested in lending an ear or a 
brain. ;)

That's what I'm working on, although I'm not sure how popular that idea is 
with most folks on this list.  Everybody here is just too smart for their 
own good.   :O)

I understand those who just want to blog, and not learn Xhtml and CSS, but
is that really the focus of installing WP yourself?  Isn't that what
wp.comis, or *cringe* blogger?   Isn't that what the 1000 odd themes
at
themes.wordpress.net are for?  Or god forbid, they hire someone to create it
for them?

My point is, should the self installed version of WP be catered to the
lowest common denominator?  And not for those who desire to learn how to
"do-it-themselves"?

That's my point with a default theme that's structured for someone who might
know some HTML and CSS, but is new to the WP code structure.  Give them a
solid, commented theme that they can dig into.  If someone wants to offer a
WYSIWYG theme, more power to them.  But it shouldn't be default.

Agreed, and my point entirely. Something like this is just too much to
put into the core. Make it a seperate theme all you want, I'm sure it
will be popular, just like K2.

I could go on with the other reasons for not including something like
this, but people will keep putting words in my mouth either way, so I
give up.

It's fine that you have that opinion, but I can tell you from real-life experience that human beings with average technical knowledge consider this aspect of WordPress very weak.

Yes, there are many people out there capable of installing WordPress (i.e. using FTP and following simple directions) that aren't interested in becoming a web developer.

I guess I would have to agree with what you're saying. I think that a new
default theme should be more than documented in the code itself, but also on
the codex. Maybe even some short video tutorials if someone really wants to
put in the effort.

And also consider the plugin and theme architecture very strong. there
are hundreds of plugins and thousands of themes already out there. K2
has had great success without being in the core. Not being in the core
is not the end of the world, and won't make your theme a failure if
its as great as you are advertising it to be.

> Yes, there are many people out there capable of installing WordPress (i.e. using FTP and following simple directions) that aren't interested in becoming a web developer.

Nobody said that with the inclusion of Sandbox that they have to,
people putting words in my mouth again. Sandbox is a great base for
theme developers to work with. Having Sandbox in the core promotes
themes that are lightweight, easy to modify, etc. Hell, a theme that
derives itself from sandbox could even add an options panel to change
all the aspects of Sandbox via CSS also if it wanted.

Using a theme like K2 or anything else that aims to be configurable
through the options panel is inevitably a support nightmare. Come sit
in the IRC channel for a few days and watch the requests for how to do
what people think should be easy tasks for modifying K2 to their
likings turn into hell. Users will expect _every last aspect_ of the
theme to be configurable, a feat that simply can't be accomplished.
The harder we make the default theme to customize for the users who
just need to add some extra spacing here and there or want to add
different text or remove something that comes default in the theme,
the more of a support nightmare we create.

K2 is a perfect example of this. Its so difficult and different to
modify that it has its own support forums because the WP.org support
team simply cannot keep up or deal with all the support requests that
K2 was generating. Any theme with the same potential amount of support
load deserves to be external, there is a reason that the theming
system is made to install external themes and not originally made like
your target theme will be.

Having a very bare-bones theme in the core allows us to say "Look at
themes.wordpress.net at all the great themes available."

Can you point me to some common questions that people ask about
customizing k2? I'm thinking of adding some other versions of the k2
lite skin I'm working on for Sandbox. I suppose I should add some
comments in the CSS anyway...

Have to say, not sure if I agree or disagree on all this... ;)

The argument could be made that WP has grown from its initial 'techie' 
audience, and while still having many technical users, there's probably just 
as many doing one-click-installs through Yahoo or other ISPs that offer it. 
Now, while you could say "well, then Yahoo should have their installation 
throw in a few neato themes", I could say "if WP just came with a few neato 
themes, wouldn't that make things easier?"

It may be time for a 'hackers version' that is 'the core', has no plugins, 
and a base hackable theme like Sandbox, versus a SECOND packaging, that has 
whatever 'the group' feels are the things a non-techie should have available 
out of the box.  I know, time to package a second zip/tar, support issues 
for non-techies, etc.  But would seem that the value proposition well 
outweighs any cost.  The non-techie version would be both directly 
downloaded AND might be what gets 'suggested' for ISPs doing 
one-click-installs.

That's a rambling idea. I know.

There's sort of two threads here.  One is the need for a simple, easy to 
learn, easy to hack, easy to style default theme.  The other is a simpler 
non-techie theme, doesn't need CSS wizardry to edit, just an admin panel 
(which, mind you, need NOT be wysiwyg like Canvas, etc...  Base color, font 
choice isn't too difficult to do via picklists and dropdowns, a preview is 
certainly possible given the Edit panel already does one...).

Here's what I think about all this...

a. Most themes are based on the default theme, which really doesn't  
do allot of things the simple way, so I think there should be some  
sort of bare-bones basic theme with good markup included in the  
package for themes to be based on

b. I don't think the default theme matters to much, as beautiful  
kubrick was, you kinda get bored of it when 100,000 sites use it,  
even with different header images. wordpress users should be  
encouraged to use different themes.

  c. as mentioned, wordpress is really being used by lots of non  
techie users, who find it difficult to set up themes, so how about a  
1-click theme installation from themes.wordpress.net done from the  
wordpress admin area?

Hi,
I'm setting up a blog hosting site, and I really want the users to be  
able to use their own themes, what are the different security risks  
and implications to this?
I am NOT using mu, rather a customized WP config file that gets the  
right tables from the database based on the subdomain. currently it's  
set up that the different blogs use different tables in the same  
databse (with no shared tables) but I can seperate them to different  
databases if that helps, though the db user will still be the same.

The themes are a big security risk in WP, considering they are php files 
(and therefore, can execute any command on a unix level as the server). 
As a precaution (though offers very little protection) is to setup the 
multiple blogs to use separate databases (with different db_users and 
capabilities). This would prevent some blogs from messing around with 
other people's blogs.

Also, I would recommend changing all .php files to read only by the 
server, except wp-content is extremely vulnerable. You could remove 
write access to wp-content, but users will never be able to upload their 
own themes.

It's fully possible to do multiple blogs on a standard WP
installation. You just put /wordpress/ in the root directory, and then
have each domain folder with its own index.php, config.php and
.htaccess, a symlink to the master wordpress directory, which has a
config.php containing "require($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] .
'/config.php');"

Each installation shares the WP files, but has its own db credentials,
including table prefix.

Unfortunately, of course, they also share a wp-content directory,
something I haven't been able to figure out how to get around. It's
great for sharing themes and plugins, but ideally they'd have their
own upload directories, which brings us to this,

> Moving away from fixed directory structures (the location

Which is absurd. It would take about two seconds to allow config.php
to override the default '/wp-content/uploads' directory with a
separate local and web location. (so you can put it outside the
symlinked wordpress folder)

Can you elaborate please? Do you mean better able to serve their  
purpose for the sake of developers, or for users? Certainly a ton of  
users would prefer to have WP be multi-blog capable.  If a user  
starts a blog and then decides they want another (which I can attest  
happens frequently with my users), do they then do a 2nd WP  
installation (and have to worry about upgrading them separately), or  
try and figure out how to integrate their existing blog into Lyceum  
or MU? Why not just build it into the main trunk and future-proof all  
users? Is there some issue with extra overhead or code complexity?  
I'm just trying to get a handle on the reasons for what seems like a  
huge omission in the WP feature list.

Thanks,
Scot

WPMU is primarily targeted at shared hosting setups with hundreds and 
thousands of blogs (almost 300k in the case of wordpress.com).  We don't 
need that kind of capability in core WP, which is targeted at single 
blog setups.  WP does have some unofficial multiple blog capability. 
Turning that into an MU light wouldn't take a whole lot, but nobody has 
been interested enough to make it happen. It could probably be done as 
a plugin.

Often times those wanting multiple personal blogs simply architect their 
single blog to fit their needs or use WP's under-the-covers multi-blog 
support.  Those needing true multi-blog capability with site 
administration and added security features pick WPMU or Lyceum.

I've used this for a few clients who wanted to share login info and  
user profiles across a few sites.  It requires WP table and MySQL  
knowledge, and some code, depending on how you want permissions to  
work.  I've actually been kicking around a few ideas for making this  
into a plugin to make things like copying permissions from one blog  
to another doable without custom MySQL queries.  This would be  
strictly for the 2-10 blog market.  Anything more and it's time to  
look at MU.

With any luck, a client will require it, and I'll get paid to write  
the plugin, which I'll push for being a GPL affair, but until then,  
if you'd like to contact me off-list, I can point you in the right  
direction.

Moh.  There's a new version of the plugin which fixes the problem.

(Guess that'll teach me for blindly adding patches to my code d: d: )

So this would mean opening up a connection to the site and then displaying
the themes and then somehow transfering the theme files to the users server
and activating it?

It still has a bit of work to do, but we're hoping to share as much of the
semantics as makes sense.

I just put together a simple method, based on Francis' technique.

It's benefits are:
1. You only need to edit 3 lines in wp-config.php and do not need to  
add multiple config files.
2. All installations use the same database, with the prefix  
determined automatically.
3. Great for shared hosting plans, which limit the number of domains  
and databases, but allow domain pointing.

Unlike the other method, themes and plugins are shared, so this isn't  
suitable for different users wanting to share an installation, but  
it's really simple to set up if you're running multiple wordpress sites.

Here are the 3 lines of code:

$table_prefix = ereg_replace('^(www\.)', '', $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']);
$table_prefix =  ereg_replace('\.', '', $table_prefix);
$table_prefix  = $table_prefix . '_';

The first line filters out www. from the beginning, so  
www.example.com and example.com use the same tables
the second line filters out the dots.
the third line combines it all with an underscore.

I wrote about it in my blog, the post can be found here: http:// 
me.mywebsight.ws/2006/08/11/host-multiple-wp-sites-on-one-installation/

Any feedback welcome.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Possible Bug: Displaying HTML in Posts Using WYSIWYG
Message-ID: <44DBBFCB.3010606@ethilien.net>

No matter how hard I try I cannot seem to get HTML to actually display 
in a post (by display I mean that it is not parsed by the browser, it 
shows up as visible text on the page). I write a lot of posts relating 
to HTML, and its really annoying not being able to make any of it visible.

For instance, if I wanted to demonstrate how to write an html link, I 
type "<a href="index.htm">Index</a>" into the editor. At first it shows 
up as visible text, but if I open the HTML editor, the code is not 
escaped as I would expect it to be. Instead it shows up as "<a 
href="index.htm">Index</a>" (its not escaped in other words). If I then 
close the HTML editor, what I wanted to appear as plain text suddenly 
becomes a link. If I save or publish the post without ever opening the 
HTML editor, the same thing happens.

Even if I try escaping my HTML in the HTML editor, "&lt;a 
href=&quot;index.htm&quote&t;Index&lt;/a&gt;", when I hit update it 
turns back into a link.

The last option, typing the escaped HTML into the wysywig DOES work, 
sort of. If I save the post and continue editing, the href attribute 
suddenly becomes xhref, makes this method useless just as much as the 
others.

Is this a bug, or is it supposed to behave this way? Its worth noting 
that the version of tinyMCE available from its website doesn't do this. 
Any HTML typed into the wysiwyg is escaped in the HTML editor. Was this 
modification of tinyMCE intentional for use in WP?

Thanks for the help,
Connor McKay

Doh.  That was my patch, wasn't it?  It must be adding that custom  
field multiple times instead of replacing the existing one.  Hope you  
can figure out a way to  keep the idea in there, however, because it  
really speeds up the showing of tags for a given post.

Sorry to anyone who was inconvenienced by that issue!

TinyMCE can be configured lots of ways. We recently updated TinyMCE
and modified the default behavior to encode everything typed in the
editor. That is, when you type < it gets saved as &lt; and displayed
on the web as <.

r0x0r! It's great to see this kind of cooperation happening between two 
great theme projects! There has been some discussion on the microformats 
mailing list about Sandbox and its use of hAtom, and the potential of 
the hAtom microformat in general as a sort of CSS common denominator 
between sites.

Just earlier today, a user alerted me to a styling problem on one of my 
older sites, where the sidebar was overlapping the content in IE due to 
some very long category names (stemming from some poorly thought-out 
auto importing). I spent some time trying to get IE to apply 
"overflow:hidden" on the sidebar, but it wouldn't take for some reason. 
So I installed Sandbox, spent a few minutes copying and tweaking some of 
the old CSS rules into a new Sandbox skin, and voila! I now have much 
better cross-browser compatibility and *much* improved semantics, to boot!

Thanks, Andy & Scott!

That's great that its updated!

I just downloaded the trunk version and tried it out, it works exactly 
how I wanted it to. Unfortunately it does not appear that I can copy the 
new scripts folder over the 2.0.4 version, so it won't work on my 
current install.

Are there any flagrant reasons why I should not use the trunk version as 
my active blog, at least until the next version of wp comes out?

Thanks for the help,
Connor

Well, the trunk is being actively developed all the time, so there may be
bugs, security holes, etc. seeing as it isn't a final release version.
However, I've heard of many people running their blogs off of the WP trunk,
so you should be fine.

Yea, I've been running it for a little bit. Just go and try out every new
revision on your home computer before you upload to see if there is any
flagrant errors.

Message-ID: <f791f4670608140402h65c4e563ydc2a18476ca0f60c@mail.gmail.com>

... long time listener, first time caller ...

I was asked by a client to migrate their existing Movable Type blog across
to WP, so no problem I thought, I'll just use the MT import tool.

I got all the content exported from MT ok... even imported it in to WP ok -
but then I noticed that certain HTML tags had been stripped out -
specifically the OBJECT/EMBED tags (for flash movies).

Also they had some JavaScript blocks in their blog postings, (bad form, I
know).

I know that the rouge HTML tags were stripped out by 'wp_filter_kses'
because they weren't in the '$allowedposttags' array set.

My question is this... is there any way I can re-import the MT content
without having that HTML stripped out?  Does the MT Import code ignore that
I was logged in as an Administrator and have 'unfiltered_html' caps?

I appreciate any advice/feedback that you guys (and gals) have.

Regards,
- Lee

A quick scan of the 2.0.4 importer code leads me to the following
conclusions:

1) The MT importer allows you to map the MT users onto existing or new
WordPress users.
2) The posts are entered with the rights of the new/existing wordpress users
3) If you ask for new users they are created with the default rights
according to the "New User Default Role" on the General Options page.

Therefore you have two options:
1) Create a user before import for each MT User and make them an Editor
(or give them the unfilter_html cap manually)
2) Set the Default User Role to Editor

Hope this helps

I had a similar experience. For years, a client had been uploading  
images to their MT blog with Ecto, using the "Thumbnail" mode, so  
that clicking images would display them full size in a pop-up. Every  
img tag had a little JavaScript reference as an attribute, and the WP  
importer stripped every one of them without notice, leaving him with  
plain image links. I finally fixed the problem by setting the client  
up with the LightBox WP plugin as an alternative, but man, I hated  
the MT --> WP importer that day.

Would be great if there were some user-controllable options for this  
kind of thing in the importer UI.

Message-ID: <2ECFFF89-20DC-4FD4-BA2C-0FD917DD5B2C@codehooligans.com>

Hi all, Happy Monday (if there is such a thing).

Last week I was migrating a site to a private server for a client.  
This is a high traffic site using WP 2.x. The site was running on a  
shared server with other clients but just kept eating up too many  
system resources, mainly MySQL, so the decision was made to migrate  
the site to a private server.

During the time this site was running on the shared server and MySQL  
was crashing we kept seeing the standard WP 'Can't connect to  
Database' message. Sorry, I'm not sure I can reproduce this error at  
the moment.

My question is this. Is there a way to override these type or errors  
via my template code? Looking for something like the 404.php template  
file that can be branded like the site theme. This would also  
facilitate capturing the error and controlling what gets displayed to  
the user. If not by the template override has anyone else implemented  
some form of 'nice' user error coding they would like to share?

I know there are a lot of folks who do professional templates on this list.

One thing I'm noticing more and more when folks pay for a custom 
template is that the template designer often forgets to leave some sort 
of "Powered by WordPress" link. (Although they never forget a link to 
their own site. ;)

Unless it'll absolutely ruin the entire design, please consider leaving 
the link in somewhere. It's *not* required by the GPL license, but it's 
the only promotion WordPress has. (And good karma.)

One suggestion that some of you might consider is as follows:
For client sites (assuming the custom design, etc) I've been leaving a clean
and simple "powered by wordpress" link in the footer, along with the
client's copyright information if any. Then, (and it's most folks seem to
prefer this and it appears much more professional as well), we've been
setting up an "about the site" page, with information and links back to the
developer/designer/my site, etc.

Greets:

We went through this over on the phpNuke platform a few years back.
It was the opinion of Free Software Foundation that a link had to be
in there:

What started it all:
http://phpnuke.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=4947

Francisco Burzi's response:
http://phpnuke.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=6966

I had wondered about it since I see a number of themes that don't include it.

I just tell my clients it has to be in there.  If they have an issue,
I suggest a color change for that line to make it match the background
or a nofollow tag. :)

thinking out loud...
I wonder if some designs would be better served with a small .gif of the W
from the new WordPress logo would work.  If there's not one out there, I'd
be glad to throw one together, I think I have a copy of the logo floating
around.

Yea, depending on the theme it could be centered in the footer. Just like
smile face on the wordpress.com blogs.

There's a difference between a copyright notice and a vanity link.  We 
don't put a copyright notice in the themes so there is nothing that must 
be retained.

That's an interesting read.  What Ryan said about CR vs vanity not
withstanding, it makes sense.  I think the reasoning is that you can't edit
the source code without creating a derivitive product.  And removing the
copyright notice would involve editing the source.  

I also suspect that it is easy enough to "legally" get around that
limitation.  Someone could simply remove the notices, as they like, call it
a derivitive product by putting a "NoCRNotice is based phpNuke Copyright
blah blah blah" line in a readme file and send an email with a link to the
source out to phpnuke.org.  At that point, they could even distribute it.  

I would also think WordPress is in a slightly different situation.  The
Wordpress link is in the theme.  Therefore, you are not editing the core to
remove that credit line.  

Interestingly enough, 1and1.com, "The world's largest and fastest growing
web host", now has something called a "1&1 Weblog".  They make you "agree to
the terms and conditions" of GNU GPL V2 and then set you up with a WordPress
blog.  I've yet to get their creation-process to work past the agreement
part, but obviously some people have.  In one way, they are doing good
things because they include the WP meta data: http://thewidestweb.info/
(this is an example blog they sent out the url for) (2.0.2 yikes!), but
they've obviously changed parts of the core:
http://thewidestweb.info/wp-login.php?redirect_to=%2Fwp-admin%2F (look at
the logo).  The big thing about this is that they are distributing this new
version.  They MAY have notified the powers that be, but I kind of doubt it.

A quick check of directories that this stuff installs into via
http://thewidestweb.info/wp-settings.php shows that it is installed in the
user's own directory structure.  Now, the interesting question: Since this
is still on their servers, are they distributing software?

OT: BTW, I've always understood that revealing the directory structure is
bad as it makes it easier to get directly at files once (if and when) your
site is compromised.  Should situations like the above link be corrected in
the core?

This page has a few and also a vector form of the logo:

http://wordpress.org/about/buttons/

I'll gladly add more to it if people send them to the address on that 
page. (I'm a few behind atm.)

There are also these, if you're feeling the love:

http://faq.wordpress.com/wordpress-logos/

There are also these photos some folks in Japan keep doing:

I have no interest in the legalities of it, or even trying to enforce 
any restrictions that might be in place. At the end of the day people 
will do what they want to do, and I'm fine with that! I really believe 
in the core of Free software, people should be able to do whatever they 
want with it.

I just wanted to remind folks who DO care about WordPress to not forget 
and to encourage others. It's a social thing, a karma thing, not a legal 
thing.

People find WordPress pretty much solely through the credit links, it's 
how it has spread virally thus far. When some of the biggest blogs out 
there, like Gigaom.com, Techcrunch.com, and the NY Times blogs forget or 
remove the link, it's that much harder for the WP word to get out there.

I'm sure the people running each of those would have no problem with a 
WordPress link somewhere on the page, but we all know at the end of the 
day it's someone on this list who does the actual work. :)

(Also if one of the biggest sites on the web, About.com, can do it, why 
can't anyone else? Kudos to those folks, btw.)

Intersting  stuff! Thanks for the information. I have always
thought  that  Francisco  Burzi's hardcoding of  the  footer
(with  acknowledgements)  was  a matter of vanity  and  self
interest.  I run two PHP-Nuke sites and I know it's hard  to
remove  that footer (I never have). All the 'out of the box'
themes appear to include the footer as well.

The  former can get the Webmaster penalised for hidden links
(people  like  Matt Cutts have discussed this  before).  The
latter is more reasonable, IMHO.

Best wishes,

Roy

I just noticed that gigaom in his redesign didn't have a link. I think it's
a fair request.

Ironically, that Apple Stupent Blog now does have "Powered by

Heh, good morning Mister Freud.  ;-)

This whole discussion reminded me to add the wordpress link back into
the blog that I just launched for the company I work for.  If
anybody's interested.  :)  http://blogs.iol.co.za/
We launched it last week wednesday, and will be starting to advertise
it on all our other sites to encourage our readers to interact on it.
Choosing Wordpress was purely my decision (I'm Lead Developer here at
IOL), and I was familiar with Wordpress to begin with, so chose that.
I don't regret it at all.

I'm working on a new product that we'll be launching next week, which
I'm building using Wordpress, and poking around the code and
documentation more and more, I find that Wordpress just rocks more and
more every day. :-)  I have full intentions of having a Powered by
Wordpress link on this new product too, but I suspect that due to the
nature of the product (it won't be a blog), can't say anything about
it yet, hush hush and all), the powers that be above my head might
veto that decision...  I've had to make some mods to the core code to
make it do what I want it to, unfortunately nothing that will benefit
the core wordpress code if I submitted it to be committed to the
subversion repository.

We'll also be rolling out something similar to wordress.com with WPmu
sometime soon too.  Long live wordpress!  :-)

(Yes, I'm newish to the list.  eh-eh)

Thanks for the reminder. I'd just been leaving the Wordpress META tag in the
header and figuring that people would suss it out. I'm going back to the
sites I design and dropping a link in there now. I mean, I already tell
everyone how great Wordpress is, and I refuse to use anything else when I'm
doing consulting work - why not have a link?

Hello

I am on debian etch and have installed wordpress locally 
as localhost/wordpress.

Now I would prefer to post a blog via email using my favourite mail
client. Since everything is local on my machine, the question arises
can't I use the smtp and pop3 server of my machine which would send
the blog?

Thanks

Surely you can just set the wordpress blog by email pickup settings to
be localhost?
That should pick up from a local pop3 account if you've set your pop3
server up to accept connections from localhost...

I seem to recall that "cloaking" text like that was frowned upon by the

Don't confuse mass utilization with stability.  Trunk can and _does_  
break from time to time.  People also need to be aware that some  
plugins won't work on trunk, and once you go to Trunk, there is no  
downgrade script.  Not trying to scare anyone off... they should just  
know what they're in for.

Whoa, how embarrassing!  :-)
Thanks!
New site, new dev-to-live rollout, and our sysadmin seems to have
rolled out to the wrong directory, and overwrote the index.php  :-\

All fixed!  :-)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Request new function: get_plugininfo()
Message-ID: <5ec14d0608151155w758a5662u95c75243d0022bfc@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy all,
  I'd like to request that a new function be added to WordPress.  Like
many plugin developers, at some point or another I need to find out
the path to my plugin's directory, and many times the URL to my
plugins directory.

  I see this being done in a lot of plugins.  Personally I use
define() right at the start of my plugins to define that info.  I just
cracked open the Sidebar Widgets plugin, and it does it a little
different, but for the same end purpose.

  So I'd like to see a function added to WordPress, possibly named
get_plugininfo() (similar to get_bloginfo()).  With this function a
plugin can get that info without needing to define it itself.  So a
plugin could call the function like this:

get_plugininfo('url')

  To get the URL to it's directory, or:

get_plugininfo('path')

  To get the full path to it's directory.

I've already written the functions and tested them.  Here is the
source code: http://www.headzoo.com/get_plugininfo.phps

  It uses two functions to set and get from the $pluginInfos global
array.  A change will have to be made to the wp-settings.php file,
adding add_plugininfo() calls as the plugins are being loaded.

  The get_plugininfo() function uses PHP's debug_backtrace() to find
out which plugin called the function.  I did some profiling which
called the get_plugininfo() 1,000 times, and it only added 0.137
seconds to WordPress's total execution time.  That's pretty good
itself, even though the function would likely only be called a few
dozen times total.

  Thoughts?

- Sean

That's a pretty sad and selfish statement, OK, so matt (and I'm not
particularly stickup of for him, nor do I think he needs it), happens to
have startup up and be the end point as far as responsibility goes for
Wordpress, why should you or anyone else for that matter question his
activities outside the WP community. He's entitled to make a living, and is
in a position to do quite well, if you're jealous or envious of that fact,
then maybe you need to work a little harder. The fact remains, that WP is
still free (both .com and .org) for users to either sign up a blog, or
download, hack, etc, for themselves and for paying clients. There's nothing
wrong with this, but I think all matt was trying to say, is that, if you're
out there using WP for profit, why not promote the community a bit as well.
If that's a problem for you specifically, or anyone else for that matter,
then you're just looking for something for nothing, in this case it happens
to be a robust and powerful platform which you can easily generate tons of
client/consulting revenue with -- and you don't have to pay for it. If you
can't at least provide a credit to the folks who put in countless hours and
have committed themselves to the open source project, shame on you, it's got
nothing to do with matt personally, or what he does or doesn't do outside of
the "open source" end of things. And from a practical standpoint, is matt
supposed to foot the bill for servers, marketing, etc personally ? So at
some point with any popular project "money" always needs to be a part of the
equation.

Again, this is a pretty short-sighted and negative statement, whether true
or not, the wp-pro list can be promoted better as I've proposed in the past,
with something like an easy email link and a web fillout form which sends an
email to the list, in logical places within the wp.org site, so that folks
who would be less inclined technically to do the work themselves, would have
easy access to a somewhat "official" community of professional users. We as
a community need to focus on positive things and promotion of the platform
and the community, not this type of personal 'dig' nor should we be doing
anything that creates "negative karma" within the community. What's wrong
with matt or anyone else for that matter going out and doing the best they
can to startup commercial ventures in addition to their open source efforts
? 

Personally, I've operated a for-profit consulting/development company for
over 10years, plus done a number of other 'commercial' type things, and have
been involved (and continue to be) with commercial/proprietary/venture
backed hi-tech startups for a long time, what's wrong with participating in
various open source communities as well ? Two of our current projects
include the launch of two separate open source communities/sites, one
related specifically to promotion and development around the proprietary
(and patented) technologies of a startup, but only from the angle that it
relates to the general use and promotion of some of the w3c standards
involved, and the other is a bit more general. 

All of these kinds of activities are good for all of us, they're good for
the community, and they're perfectly acceptable. Kudos -- matt, automattic,
akismet, wordpress... The more 'buzz' created by all of us in all of the
things we do, which includes when we develop a really great and popular site
for a client, the more we all benefit from the 'legitimization' of the
project. If you're (and I'm not just picking on David here, I mean anyone)
just downloading WP and then making a bunch of money via selling
solutions/sites to clients without giving something back to the community
(either in the form of a donation, as a percentage of what you're making, or
via participating in and promoting the product and the community) - shame on
you again...

I meant that many people were running trunk without any major issues. Of
course it can break -- it's under development. Like you said, they should
just know that this can happen and when it does they will have to deal with
some issues.

Thanks for all the help everyone!

I have however, found another solution that doesn't involve using trunk 
(and is thus much more stable). I'm using phpMarkdown with the WYSIWYG 
turned off, which is absolutely perfect for inserting visible code into 
posts.

2005)/.

To be fair, neither WordPress.org nor WordPress.com credit Apache, PHP,
Linux/FreeBSD, and the other open source software that forms the "shoulders
of giants" that those sites are built on.  My sites certainly don't, and
yours don't either.

Maybe they should, but I personally don't feel like I'm "cheating" that
software by not promoting it on my site.

I think we can all agree that It's A Good Thing to credit WordPress, but
that maybe the lack of a credit doesn't imply a moral shortcoming.

Thanks, it seems that for some bizarre reason my localhost is blocked.

As far as I know, not out of the box, no.
Have you tried specifying your local machine's IP number instead of
'localhost' as your pop3 server?
I had the same issues with gmail a while before, and ended up hacking
together a cron script using stunnel to check my gmail.
There's also a 'wp-gmail.php' that somebody wrote (I found a google
cache'd version of it here:
http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:4Wt-fjLVmhIJ:www.audiolicious.com/weblog/wpfilez/wp-gmail.phps+wordpress+gmail+wp-gmail.php&hl=en&gl=za&ct=clnk&cd=3&client=firefox-a
 ) that you can use, but these solutions are really only if you have
ssh access to your blog's machine, and if you're comfortable in a
terminal environment.

I just noticed that I can't edit the Sandbox theme CSS files that are
located in the SKINS folder because WP isn't set up to either look for a
skins folder (which may be a nice feature, no?) or at least have the ability
to point WP to the desired path where the CSS files are living so that they
can be edited via the PRESENTATION > EDIT THEMES panel.

Thoughts?

It would be nice to have the WP file editors able to traverse
subdirectories. Anybody want to submit a patch? Something very simple
might be worthwhile.

Albeit OT, Sandbox will probably shed its "skins" before 1.0.

Does that mean b0rkage on WP.com? Just wondering. Personally, I'm liking the
idea of a SKINS folder, if for no other reason than to keep the main theme
folder relatively clean. Not that it would matter if there wasn't a folder.
I'll leave that up to the peeps with code-fu l337 5k177z.

Or you could have your custom CSS sheet in the database, so as to skip any
files. Even multiple stylesheets in the database, so you can pick from them.

I think he's looking for opinions on whether this would be a good idea and
whether it would be of good use, before he makes the effort to make it an
official request with a Trac ticket.

It  sure  is.  *smile* Some of these  downloads  will  spawn
multiple  blogs,  too. I wonder how nightlies are  accounted
for  (probably not) and how bugfix releases are  aggregated.
Similar questions arise when Mozilla/SpreadFirefox boast 200
million downloads of Firefox. The more, the merrier! *smile*

It's a good idea, I approve. My one other request would be for a
plugin to have a way to get its own version number. Obviously you
wouldn't want to have to parse the thing every time; ideally it would
be in the same serialized array that stores the list of active
plugins. Of course, you'd have to keep the two in sync, which might
mean some other hijinxs involving the modification date on the file or
something.

All around, perhaps it's just not worth it. But it would be nice--in
the spirit of staying DRY--for a plugin to know its own version,
without it being a separate variable.

Mike

I thought the same thing, since the plugin's version number is another
value I tend to store in a variable, even though it's already been
defined in the plugin's header info.

I tried to work that into the idea, but the WP function that parses
the plugin header info isn't available at the time when plugins are
included.  Doesn't mean it can't be done, but I wanted to get opinions
before putting too much effort into the idea -- or submitting it to
trac.

Subject: [wp-hackers] AJAX and responsiveness
Message-ID: <44E41825.8020301@mullenweg.com>

Part of the perceived speed of WP has nothing to do with execution, but 
how it feels. Some of the new AJAX, for example deleting and approving 
and unapproving comments, does save pageloads but I think under high 
latency situations (ie, dialup) it actually makes WP seem slower and 
sometimes broken. (But dangit if I don't love the approve/unapprove blinky.)

The issue is twofold:

1. We wait for a response from the server before updating the UI
2. If you try to fire off two at once, things break

For those of you lucky enough to have fast servers and connections, try 
adding something like a sleep(1) to the top of comment.php.

1. Go to the comments screen.
2. Click the approve/unapprove, notice how the delay is annoying
3. Now do two in a row, if the first AJAX request hasn't finished, it 
takes you to another page

I don't think there's anything wrong with updating the UI immediately as 
a result of the user's actions, and then queuing up the requests to run 
in the background. (And queuing them, not breaking if more than one 
lines up at the same time.)

Anyone have any proposed solutions or patches for this?

For 2, you need to something clever in the javascript.  The current code
assumes a single delete at a time and messes up - The patch I wrote up a
while ago for multiple delete in the link manager worked around this with
improved ajax routines (see http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/923 and in
particular
http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/923/links-multi-delete-ajax.diff)
which also warn you if one is currently in progress rather than
overwriting the state information.

I doubt that patch applies to trunk as it is over a year old!

Updating the UI before the action has completed sounds a little dangerous
- how do we get the deleted item back if it was rejected by the wordpress
install?

What about a fade over box which says something like delete in progress
and greys out the page - displaying useful progress messages by hooking
into the sack events and the ajax request progresses?

I think updating the UI immediately is fine, if we watch _very_
carefully for any condition where a user might be shown the UI for
something they're not allowed to do. This involves a very fine-toothed
comb and much testing, and if everyone is willing, then I say we
should go for it.

Automattic doesn't do any consulting, and never has. It was considered

Updating UI immediately is, imho, not optimal - users in a hurry are
likely to click away, assuming things are complete. And it's not
enough to say "even though the visuals may have updated, the action
might not have happened, so wait a bit". If you want users to wait
until an action completes, wait for the visual element to update.

This is a downside to Ajax, but imho it's a necessary one - you can't
have the complete desktop metaphor. At some point, you have to give in
to basic HTTP.

Hi, shorty...
Well, his title uses "request" and the first line of his post says "request"
and adding a ticket to Trac takes all of 10 seconds and cut/paste of what
he's already written so I don't think it's an effort to do that... :^)

Your point is well made, however, and certainly feedback is critical!

You can always Update the UI and have a little * Proccessing Requests Sign.
Then it disappears when it's done. This way, it doesn't take forever to load
and the user knows that something is still going on.

Or, you could do what's more obvious, and have a the animation
indicate that something's going on, and THEN update the UI to act as
confirmation. Which is the obvious way around.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Comments Database
Message-ID: <44E459E4.18736.1EFE53DD@trd.ntsshow.com>

I have a question about the wp-comments database. I have created a page 
(called shout outs) that is within my wordpress but that is not displayed for 
everyone to see. I have this page linked from another site but not from 
within my wordpress homepage.

Okay, so the question is can I create another comments database say wp-
commnets2 to handle all the comments created by those who view the 
"shout outs" page? I have tried to alter the "page" template for "shout outs" 
using this code

<?php comments_template(); Get wp-comments2.php template ?>

but this causes an error.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this work?

Thanks

Subject: [wp-hackers] Functionality Issue With Dropdown_Cats
Message-ID: <44E45A56.10083.1F00113D@trd.ntsshow.com>

Hello,

I want to use <?php dropdown_cats; ?> in my sidebar where it shows only 
the children_of a category.

When I use this code

<form action="<?php echo $PHP_SELF ?>" method="get">
<?php dropdown_cats(); ?>
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="view" />
</form>

it lists all the categories I have and this is not what I want. Before I started 
trying to use dropdown_cats I used wp_list_cats with the "chidren_of" 
function on my sidebar to limit what categories where displayed on a 
particular page. For example, on my homepage the categories on the 
sidebar where Movies, TV, Sports, & News. When you clicked on Movies 
you went to the movie page and the sidebar changed to display only the 
"children_of" the Movies category which looked something like this: 
American Pie, Hook, No Way Out, Pirates of the Carribean 2, Tombstone, 
etc.

So my question is can I get this same functionality with dropdown_cats? It 
seems it should be possible but I just can't seems to figure it out.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Standard JavaScript
Message-ID: <d9b01a0608170921h3cd49c10ka204677df002d742@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I just wanted to inquire as to the state of a "standard JavaScript"
initiative for Wordpress. I've noticed that many plugins--both admin-
and public-facing--include common functions like the AJAX try-catch
block, and this seem unnecessarily wasteful.

I like that the WP admin area includes addLoadEvent, and I guess I'm
just wondering if there'd be interest in either creating a small WP JS
library, or adopting one, such as Prototype/Behaviour.

It could be "not in the header" by default, but any plugin or theme
could call a function (before output starts) that causes the link to
be included, both on the public side and admin panel.

Finally, I've noticed a lot of plugins that insert great gobs of JS
and CSS directly into the header, rather than referencing external,
cache-able locations. The get_plugininfo would help make this easier,
but in the meantime, you could do a trick like the WP-Cats plugin,
where the "external" locations are just GET parameters on the root of
the blog, eg:

<http://uwmike.com/?wp-cats=css> and <http://uwmike.com/?wp-cats=js>

Doing this keeps the main markup clean, and it also lets the whole
plugin be packaged neatly into a single PHP file. But it would be
helpful to have a way to "trigger" the availability of certain
oft-used JS functions.

With 2.1, they definitely shouldn't. The new script loader is made to
handle this (on the admin side at least). On the public side, the
libraries are still there and available.

Prototype 1.5.0 out of their SVN repository is in the core. (We're
using unstable because 1.4.0 and TinyMCE do not play along well
together).

wp_enqueue_script

I agree, they should be spitting out a cachable JS file.

Doesn't php take everything after a ';' mark as a seperate line?

I do as well but it's slow to reload the page when you're looking at
an entire month's worth of posts and you're waiting for the reload,
even on the pair of OC-192's I get to use.

No, it takes it as a seperate expression. Try not to equate things
like this too much.

I would rather not introduce the equivalent of a spinning hourglass to 
WP. I think the cases in which this mode of interaction would be 
sub-optimal are conceivable but far far fewer than the ones where the 
current interaction hurts.

There is an issue with this that I've run into. If the action fails,  
you need a mechanism to put the item *back* and alert the user that  
it failed. A queue can work well, but remember that any queued  
actions will not fire if the user leaves the page.

Cheers,

The good news is that there's three ways to provide a satisfactory user
experience:  (1) Make the operation fast enough that it's effectively
instantaneous, (2) take as long as you like to complete the operation but
present user feedback (hourglass, non-determinate progress bar)
instantaneously, and (3) update the view instantaneously but complete the
operation asynchonously.

This is what I was thinking would be the easiest solution. If you
don't want comments appearing on ALL your Pages, you can create a copy
of your theme's page.php and name it something like shoutout.php and
use that as the template page.

Okay, this is what I have done. I copied my themes page.php and renamed 
it page2.php.  I then opened the Admin Panel in WP and chose "Write 
Page"  titled it "Shout Outs" then used the dropdown menu on the side to 
select the page2.php template.  

The problem is that any comments on my "Shout Outs" page are stored in 
the default wp-comments database.  I have a "Recent Comments" plugin 
that reads any comments in the wp-comments database and posts them to 
a certian page in my main WP site. I don't want the comments posted on 
the "Shout Outs" page to be included. So that is why I created the second 
database wp-comments2.  I just can't get the page2.php to store the 
comments there.

Hi,

Just a quick questions about putting the two together: should I keep  
the fetch_rss(), wp_rss() and get_rss() functions (the latter two  
aren't actually called anywhere)?

Oh, and is anyone gonna put a log of last night's meetup on the codex?

As far as I can tell from a quick look at the Xref of the code, I don't
believe so (someone please correct me if I'm wrong...). You could submit a
feature request ticket to Trac <http://trac.wordpress.org/> (
trac.wordpress.org) so it can be added into the code.

You could easily modify the latest comments plugin to skip any comments
posted on that page, by checking the comment's page ID to the Shout Outs
page's ID.

I take it SimplePie = http://simplepie.org/?

Well, I'd say make new functions then just have the fetch_rss(), wp_rss()
and get_rss() functions act as "aliases" to the new functions... just make
sure the functionality/arguments are the same...

No such feature to "check" the comments page id.  Using Fuzzy Recent 
Comments found here http://www.semiologic.com/software/recent-
comments/

Any other workarounds?

Thanks

Subject: [wp-hackers] Include popular libs with a function
Message-ID: <5ec14d0608172131q2d511ffdo74d5c62d606633b5@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy all,
  I've brought this up before on the list, on IRC, and on my blog
(Matt commented on the post), but I'll bring it up again.

  To me it seems like a good idea for WP to automatically include
popular JS libraries like Prototype and Scriptaculous.

  I see plugin after plugin using those scripts, and it seems wasteful
for each plugin to include the scripts, and insert them into the
document's head.

  On top of that I'd like to see a single function call to insert the
scripts into the documents head.  Something like:

add_head('prototype');
add_head('tw-sack');

etc.  The function would not only take care of adding the scripts to
the document's head, but would also make sure the scripts aren't being
included more than once.

  I wanted to get some thoughts on the idea before writing up a
working function, and submitting it to trac.

- Sean

See: WP_Scripts and related.

Could probably use with an extension or modification to work outside
the admin area, but it does all of what you describe and more.

A patch for this has been there awhile.  It just needs to be  
committed (and the ticket then closed).

I mean modifying the code yourself. If you're not able to do it by yourself,
I'm sure there are people on this list and in #wordpress on freenode that
would be glad to help you out.

I'm developing plugin using php 5 on windows XP. The function wp_mail() does
not work because php mail() function returns false.  I read through lots of
questions and replies, but still not clear.  I would like to stick with
wp_mail() and mail() instead of a mail plugin for simplicity reason. Any
idea how to make php mail() work on windows XP?
Thanks,

After looking through the source code, it seems like this solution
doesn't fully satisfy my original request, which is to include JS libs
that would be beneficial to plugin developers, not just libs that WP
uses.

You're now including Prototype, which is cool, but you seem to be
including it mostly because WP now uses it.  I'd also like to see libs
like Scriptaculous, Dojo, etc included.  It doesn't matter if WP
itself never uses them.  What matters is they are already there for
plugin developers to use.

- Sean

P.S. It would also be helpful to include useful PHP libs like Domit!,
PHP.XPath, etc for plugin developers to use.

This is a really interesting idea.  Could this be done in the form of a
plug-in which registers these libraries in some standard way?  I'm primarily
using the Yahoo UI Library for the style I've talked about, and I'd be happy
to package this up in some standard way for everyone to use.

You might have to edit the php.ini file for the smtp stuff to work for
windows. I have php5 installed on winxp and the mail function seems to work
fine for me.

Hi,

I used to have the same problem developing in windows XP. I tried
http://www.xmailserver.org/ and it worked for me.

Yea, but the problem is that it adds more files that aren't needed.

According to the mail() manual page (http://www.php.net/mail), the PHP mail
functions use the UNIX program sendmail, which is not available on Windows.
Therefore, there are several configuration directives that you can set so
the function uses an SMTP connection instead (SMTP and smtp_port).

I believe there are libraries that can do this transparently for you, I know
phpBB employs a similar method.

It's a good idea, but when you add a lot of 3rd party JS libraries, keeping
them up to date may become a pain, more importantly if a XSS exploit or so
on is discovered and a fix is released, but takes a while to get into the WP
core's version.

I don't see how that's an issue.  Certainly you're not worried about
file size when it comes to downloading WP?  Also I'd like to redefine
what "needed" means.  Just because WP doesn't need it, doesn't mean
plugin developers from all over won't use it.

I suspected that would be the #1 argument against the idea. :)  But
I'm not talking about every 3rd party lib on the web.  Just the "top"
ones.  JS libs like Scritaculous and Dojo are very solid, and have
strong communities behind them.  Besides, with Prototype,
Scriptaculous, and Dojo, you really don't need anything else.  Those
libs cover pretty much every base.

The same holds true for popular PHP libs like Domit!, and PHP.XPath.
Both of those libs are already being used in popular CMSs like Mambo.

The whole idea is about efficiency, and making WP a more attractive
development platform.

[Looking at nightly /]

roy@BAINE:~/public_html/wordpress> grep -R wp_rss *
wp-includes/rss.php:function wp_rss ($url, $num) {
roy@BAINE:~/public_html/wordpress> grep -R get_rss *
wp-includes/rss.php:function get_rss ($uri, $num = 5) { // Like get  
posts, but for RSS

Seems like they may be deprecated. The Codex might shed some light on this.

I wonder if SimplePie is somehow related to MagPie RSS. While I don't  
know what you try to achieve, if you want to plug in a feed, why not  
just redirect all requests to the feeds?

It usually gets pasted into the Wiki. The archive seemed complete the  
last time I looked. *smile*

The Codex doesn't, I'd already looked there :)

It'd be hard to make the return values the same (although it is  
doable, albeit in a rather flawed manner, which would absolutely eat  
memory), as the parsers work in very different ways.

SimplePie 0.8, which was released back in 2004, was no more than a  
set of API functions for Magpie to try and make it easier to use.  
Since then, it's been a feed parser in its own right.

2006-08-16 isn't up there, and there was a discussion about replacing  
Magpie with it (as Magpie is now rarely updated, its support for RSS  
2.0 is sketchy, yet alone any Atom 1.0 support).

I'd push for including Behaviour. It's so incredibly clean for hooking
on unintrusive event handlers. I'd like to see more the JS-heavy
"Ajax" themes using proper onload stuff rather than just dumping
inline handlers everywhere.

I mean, we can't force anyone to do anything; the best we can do is
just include it and then recommend its use. But having it included
would be a big step toward making the whole process easier.

Just an FYI, I've been working on a new release of Magpie with an
entirely re-written parser.   Something to do on the commute since
moving to SF last month.  Hoping to get a preview release out in the
next few days.  It will have bugs, and missing features as is the
nature of preview releases, but will mostly work, and mostly be
backwards compatible.

And there are a couple of features in there which might be useful for
Wordpress (once we've got an actual release)

One, WP seems to prefer (as do many folks) to have a library
distributed as a single file, its not my preference, but I'll be
concating together a single file version as part of releases.  Long
standing feature request.

Two, the HTTP client, and perhaps more interestingly (for WP) the
cache backend is pluggable.  WP has been maintaing a forked version of
the 0.51 release that was patched to use wp-options table as a cache
backend.  Won't be neccessary to fork to do that with this version, so
hopefully a WP version wouldn't drift so far.  Its a feature I've
wanted for my own projects for a while, but also one I added for
specifically for projects like Wordpress which are embedding Magpie.

We're currently doing a bunch of Atom 1.0 related work at work (e.g.
support the new Blogger beta API) so Atom support will definitely be
there with bells on.

Use the info as you will, but if you're interested drop me a line, and
I'll make sure to let you know when PR1 is out.

Thanks

That could work if a community wants to get together and create a
WordPress Extension Pack of some sort.  The problem with that is
acceptance.  The idea wouldn't really work unless it's "official", and
lots of people know about it.

I don't think we should be including anything we don't use.

There is nothing stopping a plugin author using the builtin script  
loading functions in 2.1 to add these other libs in the same way the  
included ones are so that if more than one plugin uses the same  
library it only gets output once by the script loader.

e.g.

wp_enqueue_script('dojo', '/wp-content/plugins/myplugin/dojo.js',  
false, '0.01');

Which will register the script with the script loaded and enqueue it  
for output.

A plugin can include and register libraries to be used by other
plugins and/or themes as well. wp_register_script can be used to avoid
double loading included libraries twice. If you'd like, you can create
a bundle of all kinds of libraries for all this stuff in one plugin
and register them all, however, good luck getting every little library
and such that people want.

Personally, I'd not bother trying to push a ton of different JS
effects and helper libraries into the core All we really need is maybe
one lightweight effects library to promote some sort of consistancy
(I'd vote for moofx here, its incredibly small, lightweight, and we
already have Prototype which is an essential library in the core). I
see no need to weight down the core with 50 libraries to cover all our
bases

Then WordPress would be pretty unique in that attitude.  Development
platforms as a whole -- and make no mistakes, WP is a development
platform -- go out of their way to include reusable code that
developers can use, even if the platform itself doesn't use them.

Microsoft goes out of their way to include controls and APIs that will
be useful to developers, even if Windows doesn't use them.  They want
people to want to develop Windows applications.  So they work to make
Windows an attractive platform to develop on.

That only solves one problem.  That still means every developer needs
to include the libs with their plugin.  That still means a developer
will write a plugin that uses Prototype 1.4, and another developer
will write a plugin using Prototype 1.3.  Both libs will be included
in the document's head, which is wasteful, and adds extra seconds to
rendering the document.

If developers stuck to using what was already included with WordPress,
we wouldn't have that problem.  But since nothing is included with WP,
everyone is forced to home-grow a solution.

This is also about breaking the cycle of reinventing the wheel.  I
don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of rewriting the same
code, over and over again, each time I create a plugin.  It's getting
to the point that I can write half of the plugin's code blindfolded,
because it's the same code I have to keep writing into every plugin,
and I've done it a dozen times.

When you have a situation like that, it's time for the WP devs to step
back and take a good hard look at the API.  Find out what the most
comment tasks are in plugins -- like creating menus or Ajax enabled
plugins -- and build an easy to use framework to streamline those
task.

Including a few more of the common JS and PHP libs helps.  Creating
some additional functions/classes to streamline plugin development
also helps.  Simply exposing the core API isn't enough to satisfy most
developers.  Some code needs to be written/included specifically for
them to use.

Certainly lines need to be drawn.  I'm not saying include every single
lib found on the net.  Just a handful of the most popular ones.  The
ones that are already very stable, and already have a good community
built around them.

Consistency is a keyword here.  As I mentioned in a previous reply,
there is nothing stopping one plugin developer from using Prototype
1.4, and another developer from using 1.3.  After looking over the
script loader API, it seems like both libs would be included in the
doc's head, even if both developers are using the same functions.

Including libs ensures that developers use what they have -- i.e. what
comes with WP -- instead of supplying their own libraries.

Right, I don't want 50 libraries either.  Just a handful of the
popular ones.  I would also vote for moo.fx.

post-new.php does not exist in 2.0.4.  It is 2.1 only.

Message-ID: <5ec14d0608200621v139cad53u554d7daa336b9694@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy all,
I'm not sure if this has been brought up before, but does anything
think it's not a good idea that the wp-config.php script contains
require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-settings.php');?

I've got two problems with this:

1. It's just bad form.  The wp-config.php is designed to hold
configuration information.  It shouldn't do anymore, or any less.

2. It makes it impossible to include the wp-config.php script -- to
get the DB info -- without loading everything else.

The fix is simply adding the line
require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-settings.php'); below the require_once(
dirname(__FILE__) . '/wp-config.php'); in the wp-blog-header.php
script.  Then the wp-config.php can act exactly as it should -- as the
script that holds the DB connection information.

Not wanting to break any existing plugins, the wp-config.php script
could check for a defined constant, and if that constant is TRUE, it
skips the inclusion of the wp-settings.php.  That way all old plugins
still work, but new plugins can use wp-config.php the way it was meant
to be used.  I could do something like:

define('CONFIG_NOLOAD', true);
include('wp-config.php');

Is there also a function to get info about OTHER plugins. E.g.
get_plugininfo('fooPlugin', 'version'). I consider to write a plugin,
which depends on other plugins and maybe a specific version of this
other plugin. Is there a way to find out?

I don't know about version, but when I write a plugin that works with
another plugin, I check for the existence of a function or class
that's unique to that plugin.  Example: If you want to know if
Ultimate Tag Warrior is installed, you could do this:

if (class_exists('UltimateTagWarriorCore')) $utw_installed = true;

That makes sense -- and having that stuff there increases the likelihood of
it being messed up by somebody not familiar at all with WP. If it works, I
say go for it.

(1) The whole reason it is being discussed is due to the few times it
gets "slow" for any number of reasons. (Load, difficult, bad plugin, etc)

(2) I *love* spinners[1]. I think they are a great way to let me know
what's going on. I would be quite content to click delete, see a
spinner, and then have the comment fold up to a small green bar that
says "Deleted Comment" (or a red error, should there be one.) This could
be done with several comments simultaneously allowing me to move faster
AND still know that I can come back (scroll up) to see the result. It
would also stop me from leaving prematurely.

(3) If I read correctly, the problem with queuing things is that people
who are fast to click will think that the action has completed
successfully (as indicated by the UI) and leave. If that should happen
an there is an error, how is the user to be notified?

This works for me, as nothing needs to change for plugin or WP-tie-in  
uses.  If you think there is a need for 3rd party scripts to load the  
DB info and constants, but not WP's core functions, then this would  
be a good way to do it.  Since this is such a small thing (4 or 5  
line patch), you should probably just go ahead and code it up for all  
to see on Trac.

The first issue that should be tackled is allowing multiple events to  
be fired off at once.  I don't think people would mind this:

1. click, click, click
2. wait for 3 throbbers to stop

as much as they'd mind this:

1. click
2. wait for throbber 1 to stop
1. click
2. wait for throbber 2 to stop
1. click
2. wait for throbber 3 to stop

I'd much rather have one big wait than a bunch of small ones.  With  
one big wait I can tab away and check something else for a couple  
seconds, but slowing me down between each click makes the process  
unbearable.

Next, we have to decide on immediate feedback vs. delayed feedback.

How about giving immediate feedback (comment FAT + rollup, for  
instance), but still let the user know that the action is being  
processed?  Gmail's little "loading" text in the upper right corner  
works nicely.  We need something that says "keep on clicking, while  
we work on your first click in the background"

Also, can't we use JavaScript to prevent them from clicking away  
before the AJAX requests finish?

And with regard to error returning, after the fact (i.e. they try  
foo, we give immediate feedback saying foo happened, and then on the  
backend it turns out that foo can't happen, or failed):

How many plausible cases of that are there?  Shouldn't we know ahead  
of time for most events whether or not they'll succeed, with regard  
to permissions especially?

Making a whole system for "undoing" the graphical cues for success  
may be overkill.  If something happens that we REALLY couldn't  
predict and the user REALLY needs to know, a message should suffice.   
Do we really need to rewind the interface?  That seems like a lot of  
code for a very rare event.  Of course, I'm not really a JS guy, so  
maybe it wouldn't be so hard.  Michael D Adams... Andy Skelton...  
thoughts?

We can do this with prototype....

Ajax.Responders.register({
  onCreate: function() {
    if($('spinner') && Ajax.activeRequestCount>0)
      Effect.Appear('spinner',{duration:0.5,queue:'end'});
  },
  onComplete: function() {
    if($('spinner') && Ajax.activeRequestCount==0)
      Effect.Fade('spinner',{duration:0.5,queue:'end'});
  }

Many admin pages many plugins rely on wp-config.php to load the WP core.

His proposal wouldn't change that.  By default, wp-config.php would  
work as it always have, and load WP core.  You'd have to define a  
special constant to get WP core to NOT load.  Really, just an  
optional performance boost for people who just need the stuff in wp- 
config.php

You cannot simply edit the wp-config.php file: WP users around the world
will _not_ update their wp-config.php file next time they upgrade their WP
install. You need to add the relevant lines to the wp-settings.php file.

I think you may be confusing a few issues here.

WordPress has to this point largely hewed to a UNIX-ish design
philosophy: be good at one thing, but leave your interfaces open so that
others can supplement/complement you easily.  ("Everything's a file.  |
is your friend." etc.). Tossing in libs that WP core doesn't use
inherently violates this mode of operation.

It's not up to the WP devs to be psychic enough to include and keep
track of the largest JS packages out there (I'd particularly argue
against Dojo being included, as it's fairly heavyweight compared to
Prototype and its derivatives).  With Snoopy, TinyMCE, dbx and Prototype
now in core, I would make the claim that additional inclusions would
introduce undue burdens and potentially incur additional support
burdens.  Including those packages makes for even nastier regression
testing (wait, what?  We DO that?  *grin*) and will likely add to the
IRC and forum traffic.

What I would hope would develop as a solution to your stated issues with
NOT including Dojo, et al, is the following: authors developing
WordPress plugins wrapping up/containing the JS libs and loading them
via the new Script Loader interface.  (See
http://www.silpstream.com/blog/wp-scriptaculous/ for a pre-Script Loader
example)  Then, politely request that plugin authors using JS libs take
a look at the JS package plugins available out there before they go
including another copy of Scriptaculous.

I had to go through this a couple of times on sites I administer. The
problem is you get some punk that loves to cause problems who decides to try
and brute force a login by running a dictionary file against the password
and login information to gain access to Wordpress. Sometimes trying to
explain to people that making up a random password consisting of upper and
lower case letters along with numbers just doesn't get through. I have ended
up hacking wp-login.php on these sites to include a CAPTCHA with every
login.

 

I was wondering what everyone thought about adding something similar to the
core. It could even be modified to be similar to the way Yahoo works it,
where you get X amount of failed attempts and after that you are forced to
using the CAPTCHA.

 

Another option would be to have Wordpress reset the user's password after X
number of failed login attempts. This would be more ideal for people who are
hosted on companies that do not have GDImage enabled in PHP. Of course we
could make it customizable through the admin options:

-          Enable login security

-          Number of failed login attempts before invoking security

-          Security method: Password reset  or CAPTCHA

 

Considering the growing popularity of Wordpress and the increased use on
political sites, which are high targets for these attacks, I feel that
increasing security on the login would be highly welcomed.

I've always thought that this leads to a great attack vector: Invalidating a
small percentage of users passwords every other day.  Annoying the
membership of a site, rather than the site itself, could accomplish more
than a 1 time brute force break in with a lot less effort.  

Personally, I'd rather not see "retries" in the core, at least not on by
default.  I would advocate a "strong password" option that just checks for
length, and three out of the following four categories, when the password is
chosen:
1. Upper case letters
2. Lower case letters
3. Numbers
4. Symbols/punctuation


Is the login screen pluggable? I've never looked...

It took me a while to find it, but this was discussed in this list before.

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-December/003385.html

This large thread had quite a few solutions proposed, but I don't  
think any was incorporated into the release (2.0) at the end.

Add  some  simple  test that checks the password  against  a
dictionary and rejects trivial-to-guess passwords. The worse
type  of  attacks  don't use whole dictionaries to  crack  a
single  account. Using single words on many accounts is more
effective  if one wished to wreak havoc. Many systems assume
this  so  there's a dictionary-based check, in  addition  to
imposition  of a lower bound on the number of charcaters and
enforcing of a rich mix of characters.

Upon first inspection, this would raise concerns among the blind (see below).

...but that sounds much more sensible.

The  one  issue  with this is that it opens  the  system  to
account-targetted   vandalism.  Someone  can  affect   one's
account  and  cause  great inconvenience. Since It's  not  a
brute-force-type  attack, it will probably be less tolerable
then DDOS attacks on the login page, which at the very worst
lead  to problems in the database or bring down the  server.
You  wouldn't  want  Senator Gore with  his  20-buck-a-month
hosting relying on this... *LOL*

There are hooks on the wp-login.php page, but going your route would
actually rely on hooking into the profile page since that is where passwords
are changed. Wordpress actually does a good job at generating the random
password when you first register so you wouldn't need to check there.

This would also be a working solution (I know some forum software uses this
same type of check). 

The other option would be to generate a plugin to invoke the captcha or
retry system and possibly distribute it with the core Wordpress just as an
option for people to secure their sites a little more.

Personally, I'd rather not see "retries" in the core, at least not on by
default.  I would advocate a "strong password" option that just checks for
length, and three out of the following four categories, when the password is
chosen:
1. Upper case letters
2. Lower case letters
3. Numbers
4. Symbols/punctuation


Is the login screen pluggable? I've never looked...

I'll take a look through that. Thanks for digging it up.

Actually the sites I have done this on, this is not a concern. The only
people who login are people who write for the sites. I can see where this
would be a concern on a larger/open audience though. I also try to go with
high contrast CAPTCHA's that use larger point sizes and don't warp/rotate
the letters at all (like many of the other captcha systems do). This makes
it more open to OCR, but I doubt that is as much of a concern.

That's why I was figuring something like after 5 failed attempts; Wordpress
changes the password using the default password generator (which is actually
decent). After they hit that magic number, the password would only change
once (instead of someone doing 10,000 login attempts and that person ending
up with 2,000 password emails LOL). The other option would be to email some
sort of activation link, but then you get into the problem of the email not
going through (something rather common on crappy shared hosting).

And actually that was Senator Lieberman on his $15/month shared hosting that
was actually coming off a reseller account with 73 other sites on a single
server and wondering why it went down after a night of running two-minute
television ads with his URL at the bottom LOL.

Hey gang.

Yosemite, petit, moshu, and vkaryl have all offered assistance to me on
these problems, but we've reached a stand-still and the problems
persist. So I am turning to the Hackers group in hopes of getting these
two persistent problems resolved once and for all.

I've been running WordPress at www.drewvogel.com since June 2005 on an
FC5 box (kernel 2.6.17-1.2174_FC5) that I host. Since installing
WordPress 2.0.4 I've been having trouble in the following areas:

1. I've got WP-Cache (2.0.17) installed on my server, but I had to
disable it because it would work if the page was hit once (when the
cache page is generated), but failed to display (only a white screen is
displayed) if the page is hit again. I have tried the "ob_end_flush();"
instead of "ob_end_clear();" fix with the same disappointing result.

2. I've got my Permalinks set to Custom ("Almost Pretty") and
"/index.php/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/". The goal is to get rid
of the "/index.php" from my permalinks to make them "Pretty". As long as
I do not visit Options->Permalinks, my site functions as expected.
However, if I VISIT Options->Permalinks, my site's permalinks stop
functioning unless I set them to Default (I don't even have to click
"Update Permalinks Settings"; simply visiting the Options->Permalinks
page breaks permalinks), which breaks internal links in my site. This is
100% reproducible. The .htaccess file is 664 and writable by the server.

I have also noticed that rolling back -- that is, restoring the backup
of my .htaccess file, adding "/index.php" back to the permalink, and
restarting the server -- did not return the site to working order.
Simply VISITING Options->Permalinks is enough to cause the site to stop
working, no matter if I "Update Permalink Structure" or not. I end up
having to empty and restore my WordPress database from backup! 

I've replaced the classes.php and functions_post.php files with the
latest copies in this thread
(http://wordpress.org/support/topic/54340/page/2?replies=52) and done
all the steps here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Permalinks#Fixing_Permalink_Problems. I've
followed all the steps on
http://codex.wordpress.org/Permalinks#Fixing_Permalink_Problems, but my
.htaccess is still never updated. I've followed the steps here,
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/58389. This issue is scary because
simply visiting Options->Permalinks hoses the site.

The .htaccess looks like this:
# BEGIN Url Rewrite section
# (Automatically generated.  Do not edit this section)
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On

    RewriteBase /

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} gallery\_remote2\.php
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !/wp-gallery2\.php$
    RewriteRule .   -   [L]


    RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \ /d/([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)/([^\/\?]+)(\?.|\
.)
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !/wp-gallery2\.php$
    RewriteRule .
/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=%1&g2_serialNumbe
r=%2&g2_fileName=%3   [QSA,L]

    RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \ /f/([^?]+)(\?.|\ .)
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !/wp-gallery2\.php$
    RewriteRule .
/wp-gallery2.php?g2_controller=permalinks.Redirect&g2_filename=%1

    RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \ /v/([^?]+)(\?.|\ .)
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !/wp-gallery2\.php$
    RewriteRule .   /wp-gallery2.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_path=%1
[QSA,L]

</IfModule>

# END Url Rewrite section

# BEGIN worst-offenders
Deny from 193.93.237.16
...
Deny from 193.93.237.30
# END worst-offenders

# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>

# END WordPress

These are extremely frustrating issues! Can anyone help with any of
them? Thanks in advance!

Oopsie! My mind was wandering when I typed that. *LOL* I was actually  
involved in several long discussions about that incident.

I'm not sure about the permalink problems, but it sounds like you have
op-code caching (ie. APC) messing with your wp-cache. I went through this
also. If you look in your server error logs, you will probably see something
like this:

PHP Fatal error:  Cannot redeclare class  in
/home/www/web10/web/wp-content/plugins/wp-cache/wp-cache.php on line 446

I have not yet come up with a workaround for this and have just ended up
disabling wp-cache for the time being. I only have APC running on my test
server so it isn't a big deal, but something to be on the lookout for.

Nice to see another local guy here ;) I'm in Oxford.

I'm willing to be all wet here with the "Captain Obvious" post... but FC5
has AllowOverrides off by default in the apache configs.  Have you

I believe so, yes.  Unfortunately, not at a place where it's easy to pop

I've been meaning to ask this for a little while...
The word camp site says "There is a great wrap-up summary here.", but "here"
isn't a hyperlink.  Where's a good place to find out about what went on?

Hrm. That didn't work. Extremely perplexing and more than a little
frustrating!

Here's what I tried:

* backup WP database
* cd /var/www/html/
* mv .htaccess hta.org
* touch .htaccess
* chown .htaccess to webserver
* chmod 664 .htaccess
* pico /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:

[snip]
DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of
features.
#
<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>

# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
<Directory "/var/www/html">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
    AllowOverride None <------ this is the line to be changed
    AcceptPathInfo On
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all

# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
<Directory "/var/www/html">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All <------ this is what I changed the line to
    AcceptPathInfo On
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
[snip]

* service httpd restart
* pico /var/www/html/.htaccess -- verified that it had been written to
(it had)
* opened a webbrowser and pointed it to my page, verifying that the URL
link of an article changed from
"http://www.drewvogel.com/index.php/2006/08/18/system-strangeness/" to
"http://www.drewvogel.com/2006/08/18/system-strangeness/" (it had).
* I clicked the link and -- KABOOM! -- non-WP 404.
* I tried to roll-back -- 'mv hta.org .htaccess', re-add "/index.php" to
the permalink line, and restart the server, but it remained broken. Once
again, simply VISITING Options->Permalink is enough to 'break' it.

What does WP write when Options->Permalink is displayed? Is there some
way to compare before and after database entries to see what's getting
changed? I had to empty and restore my WP database to get it back
working.

Whenever you go to the permalinks page it does a flush_rewrite rules, which
basically rewrites the #begin Wordpress section in .htaccess to what you
have Wordpress permalinks set at. I noticed you were using other rewrites
for gallery. Just a quick question - have you tired removing that section
and seeing if that corrects it? I am not that great on rewrite rules so I
could be overlooking something in it that could be causing the problem.

I believe the problem existed prior to the inclusion of the WPGallery
stuff (even under previous versions of Fedora Core and WordPress, I've
always had "Almost Pretty" permalinks), but I will remove it and try
again just to be sure...

... I removed it and got the 404 again. I don't believe it's the
WPGallery stuff in .htaccess.

Ok, next silly question:  Is mod_rewrite enabled?

That's a fair question and reasonable to check...

Yes, in httpd.conf, I have the following line:
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

I'm running Apache 2.2.2-1.2, so I understand that there is no
"AddModule" requirement...

I can not point to any examples of the perfect AJAX interface but I
can guess what it might be like:

You click Delete and the deleted thing disappears pronto. Meanwhile
the asynchronous Delete request flies away to the server and we don't
bother checking for a response. We can be so arrogant because we know
that (pick one) everything always works or the user doesn't really
care if the deleted thing appears again on the next page load.

Do we all agree that this "perfect" example is built on an impossible
scenario? People will say it's broken if they have to delete one thing
twice due to an uncaught exception.

If you don't wait between clicks, you certainly have to keep the page
from unloading while you wait for each of your queued relays to
complete. That's an even more annoying wait because it's potentially
fifteen times longer.

Even Gmail makes you wait sometimes. That's why the Loading flag is
red. Red means STOP, WAIT. Is the goal to build a waitless interface?
Be realistic; this is the web. What is the goal?

Of course we have bulk moderation which is the fastest solution and it
doesn't use any Ajax at all.

Good point.  I'll take care of that.

The attached plugin may be of some use to you. It does not stop or
attempt to stop brute force logins, but it does reduce the use of
them. This plugin will allow you to do password strength checks on
your users and have them be required to update their password every x
(configurable) number of days, as well as a few other nice password
related security-enhancing features. I haven't yet released this, but
I likely will later this week.

Here's a preview of the admin page:

So far the only code I have found for a dropdown menu displays ALL of my 
categories allowing me to hide only one. I'm not sure what I want even 
exist.  Any help with this is appreciated.

Last option I can think of. Go to /wp-admin/options.php. Look for the
following:

category_base (delete anything in this box)

permalink_structure Paste the following into that box:

/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/

After that go to your options->permalinks page. You don't need to click the
update button, as it will do it automatically for you.

This will set you back to the standard Date and name based permalinks. See
if that is causing problems for you.

I tried your .htaccess in one of my virtual hosts and it worked fine. Of
course you could have some plugin messing with things so you might want to
try and disable all of those and re-enable them one by one trying things
out.

I believe the problem existed prior to the inclusion of the WPGallery
stuff (even under previous versions of Fedora Core and WordPress, I've
always had "Almost Pretty" permalinks), but I will remove it and try
again just to be sure...

... I removed it and got the 404 again. I don't believe it's the
WPGallery stuff in .htaccess.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Help needed with two issues on established WP install
Message-ID: <E7340445E0595A418B2F8DE0AE480E200D3E93E1@ucmail6.ad.uc.edu>

I went to /wp-admin/options.php, but searching for "category_base" and
"permalink_structure" both came up with no matches... I've got several
other files in /wp-admin/ that are options-*.php -- like discussion,
general, head, misc, permalink, reading, and writing -- could it be in
one of those?

They should be there. They are base options for Wordpress that actually
stores the permalink structure. These are the same values that are shown on
your permalinks page in the Category Base and Custom Structure fields
accordingly. Even if you select one of the pre-defined structures in the
Wordpress options, it will still appear in the Custom Structure field after
you click update, as it then updates that option in the database.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Help needed with two issues on established WP install
Message-ID: <E7340445E0595A418B2F8DE0AE480E200D3E9459@ucmail6.ad.uc.edu>

I downloaded and extracted WP2.04 from WordPress.ORG on my test machine
and there is no mention of either "category_base" or
"permalink_structure" in the options.php file located in /wp-admin/. I
searched options.php for "category" and "permalink" as well, again with
no matches.

Perhaps it's a different file you're thinking of?

I just did a fresh install of WP2.0.4 and they are both listed there. With
the fresh install, both are empty, but the options are there. Are you sure
your navigating to http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/options.php ? You need to
load the page in a browser and not an editor. If you are going to that as a
URL and they aren't listed then you have a broken installation of Wordpress.

APC and WP-Cache2 don't play together well, by default.  I found a  
solution and posted it here:

You are a life saver. I actually remember reading your post when I installed
APC a couple of weeks ago (did it on my test server for benchmarking
purposes) and couldn't find it again. I want to get everything set on my
test server before we do the upgrade on our production servers. So far
running Apache-2.2.3, PHP5 with APC and MySQL 5.0.24 seems to be handling a
decent load.

I have a hard time imagining WP ever putting a CAPTCHA check on the
login page, since that is an accessibility problem.

Changing the person's password after X number of tries might not work
if the password is changed to something that is coming up on the
crackers list of passwords.  Plus like someone else said, people would
certainly take advantage of that just to be a nuisance.

I think the only real option is to disable the account for X number of
minutes after Y number of failed login attempts.  X can keep getting
longer the more times the password is tried and fails.

Even that is not foolproof, but it throws a wrench in any crackers
software.  Come to think of it, I can't imagine WP doing any of these
things.  Something like that should probably be a plugin.

Changing a users password after several tries is no option because it
gives the "hacker" the possibility to change something... I don't want
to get a new password every day just because someone tries to guess
it.

I would prefer a wait time after 3 unsuccessful times, like a
sleep(20); or something similar. If somebody tries to login more than
five times you can normally be sure that he's not the right user... or
does anybody of you have more than five different passwords? Even Matt
had just one for everything ;)

> I think the only real option is to disable the account [...]

Locking an account is also not good. I still want to be able to log in
and post / change my password even if somebody tries to break into my
blog.

Maybe one of the next WP versions could include a simple password
check at the setup / user administration marking a password as "Good",
"Middle" or "Bad" while typing so the user can decide to use his
standard insecure 4 character password or another one.

I'm pretty sure the implementation woudn't reset the password to a
known/predictable preset password.  It would be "randomly" generated
like the current user's initial password is.  As long as it isn't
generated off of a predictible event, like seconds past the minute or
something like that, we'd be pretty safe.


> I can't imagine WP doing any of these things.  
> Something like that should probably be a plugin.
It does make some sense for this to be a plugin, as everybody obviously
has different ideas about what is "secure".  Please see Robert's earlier
post with the plugin he created.
"This plugin will allow you to do password strength checks on your users
and have them be required to update their password every x
(configurable) number of days, as well as a few other nice password
related security-enhancing features. I haven't yet released this, but I
likely will later this week.

Here's a preview of the admin page: http://lushlab.com/tmp/mpws.png
Here's the zip: http://lushlab.com/tmp/mpws.zip"

It seems to do a fairly good job of putting it all in place, though I
don't think I'd use it with the PW verification script external to the
site.  I think (hope) that's in there as it is just so that he can make
on-going improvements during the debugging stage without having to
release the plugin over and over.  I don't think people will like
clearing all of their passwords via plain text through a single external
site, no matter whose site it is. But it does make a lot of sense to
debug a plugin that is still under development in this fashion. 

I do particularly like the layout of the config screen.  It's simple and
straight forward.

It seems to have a good framework.  It would be really nice if it also
incorporated the N Tries and you're CAPTCHAed technique as an option.
Everyone seems to like that option and it continues to allow the
handicapped the normal option to login and I assume reset their password
instead of using captcha.

AH! I was opening it in an editor. I opened the file in a browser and
found the boxes and will try what you suggested.

* The category_base was empty, so I left it alone.

* The permalink_structure had
"/index.php/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/" (no quotes). I changed
it to "/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/" (no quotes).

I clicked "Update Settings" at the bottom of the options.php page to
save my change.

I tried visiting my site BEFORE I went to Options->Permalinks and got a
WP-404 (instead of the non-WP 404 I'd been getting -- that's sorta
progress, I guess).

I went to Options->Permalinks and did NOT click "Update Permalink
Structure" -- I just visited the page. I visited my site again after
that and got a WP-404 (instead of the non-WP 404 I'd been getting).

I went back to Options->Permalink and clicked "Update Permalink
Structure" and visited my site. I got a WP-404 (instead of the non-WP
404 I'd been getting).

After those errors, and waiting for the next step, I still had to EMPTY
my WP database and RESTORE it from backup; changing the permalink back
to "/index.php/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/" (no quotes) didn't
work.

I just did a fresh install of WP2.0.4 and they are both listed there.
With the fresh install, both are empty, but the options are there. Are
you sure your navigating to http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/options.php ?
You need to load the page in a browser and not an editor. If you are
going to that as a URL and they aren't listed then you have a broken
installation of Wordpress.

I downloaded and extracted WP2.04 from WordPress.ORG on my test machine
and there is no mention of either "category_base" or
"permalink_structure" in the options.php file located in /wp-admin/. I
searched options.php for "category" and "permalink" as well, again with
no matches.

When I say locking the account, I mean locking it for 20 seconds,
similar to what you've said.

Actually, its there because the external script uses a PHP extension
written in C which I can't rely on being installed on the users
server. I thought about reimplementing libcrack in PHP, but ultimately
PHP is far too slow and bundling the amount of dictionaries I use to
check the passwords wasn't an option. I know some people won't want to
send their passwords plaintext to my server, and that's why there is
an option to disable it. But for those who reason that there is easily
enough personal information about me on the internet that they could
come to my house and beat the living crap out of me if I ever misused
that script to steal their password, there shouldn't be much issue
leaving it on.

And someone who wants to stop you from using your blog just issues a
login attempt with your username every 19 seconds, and you're locked
out.

Can't we just leave it to the user? I'm all for blocking people from the 
login from after X fails, but changing passwords and forcing secure 
passwords is retarded IMO.

I prefer to not treat the user as if they are stupid, even if they are 
(and then it's their fault). Sure, a strength _indicator_ would be cool, 
but forcing? I mean, what if I wanna do test/test on my local install?

The conversation early on was with regard to people able to write
articles and such. "The only people who login are people who write for
the sites."  So, there is some reason for requiring strength on accounts
that have a certain degree of power on your site.  I don't have a
problem requiring a minimal level of security be adhered to when people
are using/have-access-to my resources.  If I don't make certain that
safe procedures are followed, it is not their fault when something
happens to the site, it is mine.

That's why my stuff is a plugin, and never, ever, ever recommended for
core inclusion.

Definitely. I've never seen a web application / service which changed
my password without my request.

> Sure, a strength _indicator_ would be cool, but forcing?

No, never force it, just mark it as "Bad" so people can decide. Not
every blog needs a super-secure-10-chacrater password.

All we need is a solution to slow down automated attacks but without
annoying the actual user.

Why not add a concept of "safe IPs" or somesuch?  Allow admins to
specify their home IP address (well, assuming they've got a static
one...) as a failsafe IP.  Login attempts coming from anywhere else are
subject to account suspensions, etc., while the home IP is always kept
open as an option of last resort.

I'd just hate to have people DoS'd by jerks attempting to log in, as
previously pointed out, every 19 seconds or so.

To the core?  It wouldn't be practical for most people. Besides, the forum
still gets questions about why their posts don't show up when hitting save
instead of publish.  Safe IPs is a little to advanced for the masses.

To the core, to a plugin that accomplishes the same effect, whatever.
It doesn't really matter to me either way - I was simply making a
suggestion as to how to avoid a particularly narsty side effect of going
the account suspension route.

I think perhaps a better route might be an informational one: generate
"excessive login attempts" emails and fire 'em off to the blog admin so
that they can at least be aware of some jerk trying to hax0r their site.

Here's a thought - why not have some options in the core that allowed you to 
configure strength etc along the lines of the major policies that get used 
(history, character length, character content and repeatability etc) ?? I 
think someone mentioned a plug-in as well, but I have not seen any hooks 
around the password entry areas.

It would be so nice to redefine the login page and control that process a 
little more. <sigh>

Another issue is with the corporate entity. A lot of LARGE corporations 
require strong passwords as part of their externalised business model, and 
as such if the WP development team want the product to taken up by corporate 
out of the box, then someone needs to make them feel a little more loved. 
The easiest way here is to hook WordPress up to the corporate LDAP/AD 
service where all of the strength is handled for you, the corporation then 
has their warmer glowier feeling.

Cheers
Nigel.

I hope that you will take the answer you got from Michael and head over to
the support forums and mark your question(s) there as being resolved and
then post the link that you got so that others can benefit from this.

Thanks. I changed it to post.php and the submenu showed up.

One more problem:  when clicking the submenu [project], it simply redirects
to post.php with a special parameter. This works on my windows XP.  But when
I deploy it to my web hosting server (Linux), clicking submenu [project]
gives error:
*
Warning*: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output
started at /home/ajchen/public_html/openlab/wp-admin/admin-header.php:16) in
*/home/ajchen/public_html/openlab/wp-includes/pluggable-functions.php* on
line *272*

This error is not seen with submenu "Write Post".  So, I think it has to do
with the wp_redirect() function used in my plugin and must be platform
dependent (works on windows but not Linux).  Any idea what happens?

I agree. It seems stupid to punish the user's account for the actions of
a would be hacker.

I'd much rather see the IP logged three times, and then simply blocked.
This would eliminate a lot of the db overhead of locking an account and
continuing to check it each time. Log the attempts, grab some data about
it and keep it around.

Just block the offending IP and be on with life. Not sure how you handle
a very advanced cracker, ie, one that uses multiple IP's.

Plugins can do it, and they have. Read up in the list for the info on my plugin.

There are LDAP plugins for WordPress available. I'm not sure as to the
extent of the functionality, but they do exist.

By telling people their passwords are weak in the admin interface, and 
if they get compromised after that saying "well, you should have had a 
strong password like we advised".

There's only so much that is WordPress's responsibility here.

Dropping in on this conversation, um, which LDAP plugins are there for

http://www.kaneit.net/ldap-plugin/ is one. There are others.
http://google.com/search?q=LDAP+plugin+for+wordpress wielded some nice results.

Blocking IPs simply doesn't work for the real buggers out there. I know from
doing admin stuff, from FileFront's GamingForums, that too often you have
both good and bad users on an ISP with shared IP pools.  You can't ban just
one IP when dealing with dynamic IP addresses, because the user will just
reboot their router and have a new ip address and a good user might get that
"bad" ip address next the next day.  And you equally can't ban the range
because you have good users in that range.  You might be willing to block
out a large chunk of a city for a smaller blog (I think I am still blocking
all Tampa Bay TimeWarner Cable customers on one site), but not for a larger
one.  

Besides, there are too many anonymous proxy engines out there.  And THEN you
get into the topic of using DNSBLs to block logins from anonymized IP
addresses.  That's a tough row to ho.  DNSBL blocked comments eventually
grew into Akismet!

That is really odd. You shouldn't have to restore your database. Simply
changing the permalink_structure back to
"/index.php/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/" in /wp-admin/options.php
should fix that. Are you checking to make sure that once you do an update on
the permalinks that your site isn't loading off of cache (ie. Checking to
make sure the post permalink is actually changed)? It almost has to be
something similar to that considering the following:

-You are getting the wordpress 404 meaning mod_rewrite is working like it
should.

-Your .htaccess file is working properly since I loaded it on my own server
with a clean install of wp2.0.4 and it worked fine.

Verify that your wordpress section of .htaccess is as follows:

# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>

# END WordPress

That will work with or without the /index.php/ (since the index.php is
forcing the load of the file index.php and the query vars won't start until
after that)

AH! I was opening it in an editor. I opened the file in a browser and
found the boxes and will try what you suggested.

* The category_base was empty, so I left it alone.

* The permalink_structure had
"/index.php/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/" (no quotes). I changed
it to "/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/" (no quotes).

I clicked "Update Settings" at the bottom of the options.php page to
save my change.

I tried visiting my site BEFORE I went to Options->Permalinks and got a
WP-404 (instead of the non-WP 404 I'd been getting -- that's sorta
progress, I guess).

I went to Options->Permalinks and did NOT click "Update Permalink
Structure" -- I just visited the page. I visited my site again after
that and got a WP-404 (instead of the non-WP 404 I'd been getting).

I went back to Options->Permalink and clicked "Update Permalink
Structure" and visited my site. I got a WP-404 (instead of the non-WP
404 I'd been getting).

After those errors, and waiting for the next step, I still had to EMPTY
my WP database and RESTORE it from backup; changing the permalink back
to "/index.php/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/" (no quotes) didn't
work.

I just did a fresh install of WP2.0.4 and they are both listed there.
With the fresh install, both are empty, but the options are there. Are
you sure your navigating to http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/options.php ?
You need to load the page in a browser and not an editor. If you are
going to that as a URL and they aren't listed then you have a broken
installation of Wordpress.

I downloaded and extracted WP2.04 from WordPress.ORG on my test machine
and there is no mention of either "category_base" or
"permalink_structure" in the options.php file located in /wp-admin/. I
searched options.php for "category" and "permalink" as well, again with
no matches.

Perhaps it's a different file you're thinking of?

That would be the big problem on IP blocking. AOL uses proxies and there are
still a lot of people who consider them an actual ISP lol.

Perhaps a notification of failed login attempts via email would be the way
to go. It atleast gives a heads up that someone is screwing around. I
wouldn't mind seeing a feature that invokes password checking. Something
could possibly be written in javascript using regular expressions to check
and see if they have a combination of upper and lower case characters along
with numbers/punctuation to make the login more secure. Just a simple
indicator that goes from like red to yellow to green or low/medium/high as
they type in the password. People who have admin or editor access should be
aware to make their passwords follow a stricter guideline (or at least have
the common sense). Authors and below aren't quiet as bad as they have
limited access as it is.

Blocking IPs simply doesn't work for the real buggers out there. I know from
doing admin stuff, from FileFront's GamingForums, that too often you have
both good and bad users on an ISP with shared IP pools.  You can't ban just
one IP when dealing with dynamic IP addresses, because the user will just
reboot their router and have a new ip address and a good user might get that
"bad" ip address next the next day.  And you equally can't ban the range
because you have good users in that range.  You might be willing to block
out a large chunk of a city for a smaller blog (I think I am still blocking
all Tampa Bay TimeWarner Cable customers on one site), but not for a larger
one.  

Besides, there are too many anonymous proxy engines out there.  And THEN you
get into the topic of using DNSBLs to block logins from anonymized IP
addresses.  That's a tough row to ho.  DNSBL blocked comments eventually
grew into Akismet!

Jamie...

Thanks for your ongoing assistance. I truly appreciate it (it's extra
nice that it's from a neighbor!).

I'm working remotely today, so will have to check the issues you mention
when I get home this evening.

However, I checked my .htaccess and the WordPress section was as you
presented it EXCEPT that my "RewriteRule . /index.php [L]" line LACKED
the "[L]". I added it.

I'll check the rest this evening when I get home.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Help needed with two issues on established WP install

I just hope we can get this figured out. I got a feeling it is going to end
up being something simple LOL.

The [L] shouldn't make much of a difference. That is just telling the
rewrite_rules that it is at the end of the expression. 

One thing you may want to try is turning on rewrite_logs. You can do that in
your server config file by adding these lines:

Rewritelog "{insert absolute or relative path to a log file"
RewriteLogLevel 9

Of course make sure that the server has read/write permissions to the log
file, then restart apache.

I would just go through and do a single test hit then deactive the logging
as it will become very large very quick (it logs image requests, favorite
icon, everything from your server). You can then go through and see if any
of the rule conditions aren't being met or send it to the list so we can
dissect it.

Jamie...

Thanks for your ongoing assistance. I truly appreciate it (it's extra
nice that it's from a neighbor!).

I'm working remotely today, so will have to check the issues you mention
when I get home this evening.

However, I checked my .htaccess and the WordPress section was as you
presented it EXCEPT that my "RewriteRule . /index.php [L]" line LACKED
the "[L]". I added it.

I'll check the rest this evening when I get home.

My web2x plugin uses wp_redirect() to start post editor:
wp_redirect("http://web2express.org/openlab/wp-admin/post.php?w2x=prj");

It works in my windows xp development environment, but it fails on linux
server with error message:
*Warning*: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by

header.php:16) in */home/ajchen/public_html/openlab/wp-includes/pluggable-
functions.php* on line *272

*Line 272 is
header("Location: $location");

wp_redirect works only in the HTTP header, so if you're no longer in
or before the header when calling wp_redirect, you'll get that kind of
error.

My plugin uses wp_redirect() to start new post editor for specific type of
post:
   wp_redirect("http://web2express.org/openlab/wp-admin/post.php?w2x=prj");

It works on windows xp, but fails on Linux server. Error message:

*Warning*: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
(output started at /home/ajchen/public_html/openlab/wp-admin/admin-
header.php:16) in */home/ajchen/public_html/openlab/wp-includes/pluggable-
functions.php* on line *272*

Line 272 is header() function. It should redirect to
   http://web2express.org/openlab/wp-admin/post.php?w2x=prj"

but, header () fails, and the browser is redirected to
http://web2express.org/openlab/wp-admin/post.php?page=prj.

There must be something printed before header() is called when wordpress is
running on Linux.  Has anybody seen this before?  Any idea what might be
printed before line 272 header() is executed?  It could be a bug.

Thanks,
AJ

One thing that bugs me a little abut the WP concept of  "Permalink"... is a 
permalink not a link that will always work in your blog, and therefore not 
customisable? This would be the index.php?p=1234 as this would always work.

The "nice" url structure is not the permalink is it?

What hook is your plugin using when it calls wp_redirect() ?  You  
should be able to safely use the "init" hook, or "plugins_loaded"

If you're hooking in with the "wp_head" hook, or any template-level  
hook, that'd cause the problem you're seeing.

I had a similar thing, and it was to do with a carriage return before the 
<?php declaration.

------------------------------------------

<?php

instead of

------------------------------------------
<?php


Windows didn't seem to care, but it blew up on Linux.

Similarly anything after the ?> including whitespace and blank lines would 
also do it.

Cheers
Nigel

You're correct in that ?p=N is the most "perma" permalink format, as  
it *always* works.  Customizable permalinks are also permanent, but  
the onus is on the site admin to not suddenly change the permalink  
structure (or, if changing it, at least construct a mod_rewrite rule  
to redirect the old requests).

So... permalinks, unless you decide to intentionally break them.

<self_promotion>
The other instance where keeping "fancy" permalinks permanent is up  
to you is with editing of the post slug, after publishing a post.   
Normally that'd break the old link.  I wrote a plugin [1] to address  
that.  It keeps track of your slug changes on each post, and forwards  
people who hit the old one.
</self_promotion>

add_action('admin_menu', 'w2x_add_pages');
function w2x_add_pages() {
    // Add submenu under Write:
    add_submenu_page('post.php', 'Write Project Post', '[project]', 8,
'prj',  'w2x_show_prj_post');
}

function w2x_show_prj_post() {
    wp_redirect(get_settings('siteurl') . "/wp-admin/post.php?w2x=prj");
}

wp_redirect() is called from the function for a new submenu item under Write
menu.  Is there any potential problem for such use of wp_redirect()?

The above approach may not be the best one.  Any better idea for  launching
the post editor from the newly added submenu [project]?

The submenu item [project] is actually a link similar to "Write Post"
submenu item, as seen in html source:

	<li><a href='http://localhost/publish/wp-admin/post.php'>Write Post</a></li>

	<li><a href='http://localhost/publish/wp-admin/page-new.php'>Write
Page</a></li>

	<li><a href='http://localhost/publish/wp-admin/post.php?page=prj'
class="current">[project]</a></li>

This means clicking on [project] should launch post editor
without a need to call wp_redirect(), but it does not. Is this a bug?


thanks,
AJ

Yes, because you've already printed out a bunch of stuff at that point.

Woah, woah.

We're not talking about blacklisting an IP from the whole site. The
topic was about stopping a bad user from running a dictionary attack
against the wp-login page.

An IP ban, even on a block, is perfectly acceptable. You're only
blocking the login page, and it would only be for a, what, few hours?
Rinse repeat till the "wannabe" gets lost.

Believe me, I know that method has holes. Spoofed IPs, multi-ip attack
bots, rolling ips, etc. But at that point, your not dealing with the
original threat (and I quoteth) "some punk that loves to cause problems".

I am of the mind, however, that anything more advanced then a simple
brute is beyond the scope of what wordpress could (or should) be
designed to handle (especially in shared host environments where load is
an issue).



I DO agree that having a password "strength" indicator would be a great
core feature -- consider it a live version of the typical (?) link that
says "use gud passwurds".

It doesn't. Either you have some nasty form of output buffering
enabled by default or you don't have error reporting on.

It seems wp_redirect() is pretty tricky, and so I change to another approach
without using wp_redirect().  It works fine on both OS. new code:
      add_submenu_page('post.php', 'Write Project Post', '[project]', 8, '
post.php?w2x=prj');

I also want to put a post-specific notice on top of the editor using
'admin_notices" hook.  But, when editing a post, the hook does not have
access to $post variable. see code below.  Is there any way to retrieve a
custom field from the post being edited inside the admin_notices hook
function?

add_action('admin_notices', 'w2x_admin_notices');
function w2x_admin_notices() {
    global $post;
    print_r($post); echo "<p>";  //empty!, bug?
    $w2x_type = get_post_custom_values("w2x"); //empty! bug?
    ...
}

Thanks,

You might have to just get its ID from the $_GET array, set it to  
$id, and then do $post = &get_post($id);

Considering the sheer number of WordPress powered blogs that are out
in the wild and how few of them have ever been attacked, I would say
pretty much anything discussed in this thread (except *maybe* strength
indicator) is best suited as a plugin. This is pure conjecture, but
I'd be willing to bet that the percentage of blogs that have ever been
compromised is closer to 0% than it is 1% of the installation base.

Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAKSaglRSZk9Oqp49Gb2lalrCgAAAEAAAAE4vrKqpDihAlJ1WaMxbPGgBAAAAAA==@comcast.net>

Dilemma - 

I have a site that I need to get EVERYTHING to end in .html (simple for almost everything using a custom permalinks like ?%whatever%\.html, I know) problems are:

Pages - created like "write page" - can't seem to figure an "easy" way to achieve this with either pages or things like /category-name type or date based archive pages. 

I already that this isn't really needed, etc, etc, it's not for me, rather someone I'm helping/trying to convince to switch from other platforms to WP. 

he's currently using either b2evolution or MT/TP for his sites/clients, they're 'seo' obsessed, and for now at least they want me to get everything to end in .html (which isn't a bad option for some folks I guess). 

where we'd like to end up is with the following:

www.site-name/pagename.html or www.site-name/2006/08/21.html (for that day's archives) or /2006.html for the years archive page, etc. 

would do site-name/pagename/child-page.html and so on. 

I've done a ton of reading on this over the past couple of days, including the WP codex, links from there, as well as various apache mod_rewrite resources, etc. 

I see two options so far (well three really, but I don't think the third really makes sense from a long term maintainability standpoint)

1) Find a way (or figure out what I'm missing/don't know) to get WP to accept more than one permalink definition using something like the existing -custom field and maybe a ; separator or something, I've noted that the wp core (functions.php) has %page% available as a 'slug' for permalinks already, so this would likely be the easiest and most maintainable method. 
1a) a plugin to accept additional permalink definitions ?

2) Hack the functions file and dupe/hack the re-write functions needed with some if's for page/category/archive situations

3) do it all by hand in .htaccess or /conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf 

Main questions:

Is there an existing way to configure more than one permalink structure ?

anyone have any other thoughts/ideas ?


*note -- on #2, we use subversion/trac internally for all projects, so I would maintain a branch for the specific folks that want to do this if I need to mess with core, and keep that up to date with other WP changes, updates/patches, etc, this way it's not a one-off hack so much, and I could maintain upgradeability, etc. for the folks I have that "need" to have everything ending in .html

thanks?chris

You could catch anything that is missed with a plugin that is hooked into
"template_redirect".

To quote from http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API
"template_redirect 

No parameter. 

Executes before the determination of the template file to be used to display
the requested page. Useful for providing additional templates based on
request criteria. Example (pedagogical, not useful): Redirect all requests
to the all.php template file in the current themes' directory. 

function all_on_one () {
	include(TEMPLATEPATH . '/all.php');
	exit;
}

add_action('template_redirect', 'all_on_one');
"

Set the permalinks to the wanted url omitting the .html.

With a plugin that filters on the_permalink (post_link?), and 
rewrite_rules. Add a rewrite rule that strips ".html" endings silently 
so both urls are valid. Something like "RewriteRule ^/(.*?).html?$ /$1 
[PT]" (untested) should do this.

Then have the "the_permalink" filter append ".html" if needed.

well, first, from everything I've ever read on the search engine methods, 
they couldn't care less what the 'file extension' is at the end.  given that 
you CAN serve up infinite pages seemingly with .html on the end, why would 
search engines even bother? ;)

second, whatever method you use, make sure it is the ONLY permalink 
structure, and NOT multiple paths to the same content.  if they are SEO 
obsessed, there should only be one way to a given piece of content on the 
site.  multiple paths to the same content dilutes pagerank (or, identical 
content dilutes pagerank) from what I've seen.

There certainly should be a way to throw .html on the end of all links, and 
strip it or ignore it.  The htaccess file should be able to do this, but 
that could lead to 'two paths to content' if you don't do it properly... 
i.e., you need to strip the .html off before handing over to index.php, BUT 
you also should FAIL if a request comes in that doesn't have .html on the 
end.  Something like that.

I've been thinking along these lines, as well as along the plugin kind of idea of Bogar's previous post, I don't want to add much[any] overhead to the system, so the .htaccess would likely be the best method for scaling, however, I've tried a number of iterations and you do end up with the 'multiple paths problem with the most viable (read:working) .htaccess methods, 

I've been examining classes.php pretty closely, and have also had the following thoughts;

1) Everything needed to accomplish something like this already exists within the existing WP re-writes code (eg, the %pagename% tag/slug for permalinks)
2) another 'quick and dirty' approach would be to change trailingshlashit() to .htmlit() -- everything - /category /year/month, etc would end up with .html instead of "/". 
3) could also do a plugin based on #2. 
4) the *simplest* solution (best IMO) is to find a way to feed more than one permalink structure (example, one for pages, one for archives, one for cats, etc) to the existing system.

Search engines don't care about file extensions, and you're just adding 
cruft to the URL that makes it harder to maintain permanently.

You might want to check your .php files and make sure the "line-endings"
are in UNIX format... I know this will cause problems with Perl scripts.

I know that, unfortunately I'm not the one that needs convincing. I just need to do what I'm told, which in this case unfortunately is waste time on this issue. The best thing to do is to use .htaccess to map all of their old nonsense to /.index.php (less the .html extensions), then let WP handle the rest as I normally do with something like the date based permalinks.

Subject: [wp-hackers] URL Re-writes for WP 'Pages' or Multiple
	Permalinkstructures
In-Reply-To: <44EC725C.9090000@robm.me.uk>
Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAKSaglRSZk9Oqp49Gb2lalpiFgsAEAAAAM0/RwOFwVNErwc16Lb2ANMBAAAAAA==@comcast.net>

One other note, the real issue, is that most of the existing 'pages' have pageranks of 7-9, so, they'd prefer if I can get WP to .html the pages coming out of WP in order to 'mimic' the old site structure, rather than re-direct to /page/ uri's since they're a bit nervous about what something like that would do to the existing page ranks. so, globally, the plan for this particular site is to get Wp to .html the "pages", then I'll force them to use the "normal" permalink structure like /2006/08/whatever for the rest of the 'blog' or dynamic portion of the site. Hence, I need to be able to feed WP two different sets of permalink structures/rules -- one for pages, and one for the rest of the site. ideally, I'd use the default "date/postname" type which I typically use. The real problem is the /pagename/ uri's (I could easily just put in /%pagename%\.html where %pagename% is a slug based on the old site's page names) in the custom permalink box, but that doesn't solve the 'proper' permalinks for the rest of the site issue.

I know this is usually a pipe dream, but I just have to suggest it:

Perhaps you and the simplepie guys can work together?

There are naturally egos attached to any created project, but since your 
end goals are identical there might be room for a combined effort there.

By 'checking', do you mean visiting
http://www.drewvogel.com/wp-admin/options.php ? If so, no, I haven't
been doing that. But I'll try it this time!

Here's what I did...
* Went to http://www.drewvogel.com/wp-admin/options.php
* The permalink_structure had
"/index.php/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/" (no quotes). I changed
it to "/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/" (no quotes).

I clicked "Update Settings" at the bottom of the options.php page to
save my change.

I tried visiting my site BEFORE I went to Options->Permalinks and got a
NON-WP 404.

* I went to Options->Permalinks and clicked "Update Permalink
Structure".

* Went to http://www.drewvogel.com/wp-admin/options.php and verified
that permalinks_structure was "/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/" (it
was).

* Visited the site and clicked an article
("http://www.drewvogel.com/2006/08/18/dinner-230-friday-august-18-2006/"
), and got a NON-WP 404.

Rolling back!

At this point, I would suggest enabling the mod_rewrite log to make certain
that mod_rewrite is fully firing. For some reason it needs the index.php
instead of mod_rewrite automatically appending the index.php.

Post both just so we got something to compare with. You only need to copy
the part for the actual page request (since image requests will also be
logged). Generally it's around 5 or 6 lines.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_options updates taking too long for page_uris and
	rewrite_rules
Message-ID: <DD12D0F1-8F2D-44F8-97EC-C34989B85A08@codehooligans.com>

So I build a custom Event Management tool for a client this past May.  
The intention was to all user to create an account and create events.  
These events are all for the same day, August 24. The Events are all  
created in WP as Pages since the client wanted to have the Events  
setup to support a logic /events/State/City/Event-Title structure.  
There are now over 2700 Events in the system. Each of the events have  
a parent Event City. That page has a parent which is the State Page.  
All State pages are under the '/events'/ node. All total there are  
3800 records in the wp_posts table. There are a few Pages outside the  
Events node.

Since Sunday Anytime someone goes in to edit/add and Event the  
database locks up. This is a private hosted server with no other  
traffic. The solution I've found that brings the site back is to  
remove the 'page_uris' and rewrite_rules' records from the wp_options  
table. Then let WP rebuild these. I've had to finally keep people off  
the system otherwise it crashes hourly.

So my question is has anyone worked with a WP installation with 3000+  
pages and if so what was done to streamline to management of these  
page? We have tried tuning the MySQL and HTTP traffic with no luck.  
Again, it's not that the server it getting that much traffic. Plus  
with WP-Cache installed the DB usage is low. It's just when someone  
goes to update and event the other HTTP request stack up behind it  
and before you know it the server is peaked.

Specs:
WP 2.0.3 with the last version of WP-Cache installed.
Red Hat Linux Enterprise.
MySQL 4.1.20
Apache 2.0.52
4G Ram
Dual AMD Opteron 246 2.0 GHz Procs

Any help of suggestions would be appreciated.

If it runs faster if those options are deleted first, then the culprit 
is likely the comparison check to see if the old value of page_uris is 
equal to the new value.  This is done to avoid an unnecessary DB update. 
  In this case, however, comparing two huge arrays for equality is much 
more expensive than just sending the update.  Try fixing it like this:

Look for the function named generate_page_rewrite_rules() in the 
wp-includes/functions-post.php file.

Within that function, look for this line:

update_option('page_uris', $page_rewrite_rules);

Right before that line, add this line:

delete_option('page_uris');

It should then look like this:

delete_option('page_uris');
update_option('page_uris', $page_rewrite_rules);

Try that out and let us know how it goes.

You are my new hero!  I've been loading up my .htaccess file with redirects,
so I'm going to try this out ASAP.

This is clearly something that should be part of WordPress proper.  Yes,
everything can be optional, but (in the same way that Linux distributions
don't just consist of the Linux kernel) not everything should be an option.

Hi Craig

Yes but i have not found any documetation that walks you through how the
core code works|unfolds
analogous to one of the drupal documents like http://drupal.org/node/10858

If anyone can point me in the right direction with a URI  that would be
much appreciated ?

Paul: The WP code is clean enough that you can actually get a pretty
decent feeling for its flow just from reading it; try going through it
with phpxref (<http://redalt.com/xref/trunk/>), where all the
functions are linked to file and line, so it's easy to follow about.

Hello Micheal,

I have bookmarked this site as its a useful site for going through wordpress
api calls and finding out what
interfaces are available to me but what i am after is something that
describes the wordpress architecture
and  explains what happens behind the scenes in detail when you load
wordpress into the browser .

Regards Paul.

What i would like to do is to understand how  the initial wordpress page is
constructed when you load wordpress into your browser and in particular how
the individual posts rendered on this page
are constructed and how that may be modified within the core to include the
name of the author against each individual posts.

To do this i need to know more about architecture at this stage i guess  and
not  what intefaces are defined by the wordpress api

Any further assistance in getting started would be greatly received

Regards Paul

Perhaps I'm missing your point, but perhaps the_author() is what you seek?

Tjis can be easily done on theme using the template tag the_author()
no need to modify anything iside WP

>Any further assistance in getting started would be greatly received

If i understand right you siply need to look for the Template Tags on
Codex documentation.

Thanks for clarification.  You don't need to understand the Cord code in WP
for that.

Have a look at:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags
(in particular: http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags#Author_tags)

The change of this nature is completely at the Theme level.

Here's the basic rundown.

After all of the libs are loaded, wp() is called.  This parses the 
incoming query, sets up the environment, and handles permalinks.  After 
that the template loader is called.  The template loader loads specific 
theme templates based on the parsed query.  All presentational stuff is 
done in the theme templates.  This includes how individual posts are 
rendered.  So, you probably just need to look over the theme development 
docs.

Message-ID: <20060824185056.c6j4ml8dnyhcckw4@banana.catalyst2.com>

Hi,

I am aware that plugin promotions may be frowned upon in this list,  
but this brand-new plugin offers a nice intergration between  
Netscape.com and WordPress blogs (it works in 1.2.x and 1.5.x as well).

What's special about this one plguin is the fact that it's  
interactive. Much as in a few Digg plugins, you can see the counts  
'live' and affect them and voting without departing from the blog. I  
thought it was a fairly nice way to promote your site and it greatly  
simplifies installation of promotional buttons.

Best wishes to all,

Roy

Thanks for helping out so far, Jamie. I really do appreciate your
assistance!

I apologize for my ignorance, but I'm not sure what I'm looking for in
the rewrite log file, so I've posted the whole thing from both the
working site (56K) and non-working (84K) configurations.

Here's what I did...

* I enabled the rewrite log on my functioning site and visited the main
page and one article. The results of that test are here:
http://www.drewvogel.com/apache_rewrite_working.txt

Then, I...
* Went to http://www.drewvogel.com/wp-admin/options.php and removed the
"/index.php" from the permalink_structure line and click the "Update
Settings" button.

* "service httpd restart" to restart Apache.

* I visited the main page and one article. The results of that test are
here: http://www.drewvogel.com/apache_rewrite_broken.txt. I received a
non-WP 404 when attempting to view the article.

On (an exciting) side note, I went back to
http://www.drewvogel.com/wp-admin/options.php, re-added the "/index.php"
to the permalink_structure field, clicked "Update Settings", and did
"service httpd restart" and my site worked again -- I didn't need to
roll it back from the database backup! That's progress, I suppose!

Please let me know how to proceed from here.

It should be noted, however, that simply visiting the Options->Permalink
page still breaks the site.

Everything looks good in the logs. They are both passing to /index.php and
nothing is stopping in the way.

Just out of curiosity - do you have some sort of query cache running on your
site? Perhaps that is causing the problem.

Also do you have any directories within your root directory that could be
causing a problem (ie. /2006/ or /2005/). Since you sometimes get a standard
404 and other times get a wp-404, it is almost acting like it is finding a
directory and looking inside of there. 

I would start by disabling any caching you might have (query, apc, wp-cache,
etc.) and see if the problem persists. This is about all I can think of at
this point.

Message-ID: <674b4a3b0608241327u2787ef0fi2ff4c6157ebffb29@mail.gmail.com>

Right now, the function get_option() is an alias for get_settings().
Are there plans eventually to make one deprecated (like get_postdata()
is for get_post() ), or will they fork in behavior like do_action()
and apply_filters()?  If not, why the alias in the first place?

We had get_settings() first and then as we fleshed out the api with add, 
delete, and update we decided to use the term option.  We can deprecate 
get_settings(), I suppose, but we'd need to change all occurrences of it 
in codebase to get_option().  We still use get_settings() in a lot of 
places.

Personally, I don't see any cost for having both. It's pretty much the same
as having a hook in there. I personally use both interchangeably and would
be bummed to see either function deprecated, so I'm giving it the big -1.

In this case "deprecated" just means that the developer documentation steers developers toward one or the other, reducing confusion all around.

Howdy all,
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the document's content-type meta
tag needs to come before any other content, including the title tag.
I'm only saying something because I see a lot of themes not following
the standard.  So consider this email a reminder. :)

I don't think it does, and can't find anything in any W3C spec to 
support this either. Can we have a link, please?

I've never heard of this either... IIRC even the W3C's example of correct
XHTML 1.0 Strict has the <title> before the content-type <meta> tag.

It'll take me a little while to track down "proof", if there is any.
The reason for putting the content-type before the title, is because
the title may have "unusual" characters in it, with non-standard
encoding (Think a Japanese website, with a Japanese title). The
doctype, html tag, and head tag, are *guaranteed* to always be
"normal" characters -- there's no way for them not to be.  Anything
past that, including the title, may contain extended character sets.
That's why you notify the browser of the character-type before it has
a chance to encounter non-standard characters.

Hello,


I am looking for a template tag that  lists all blog authors registered on a
wordpress installation but i can't see anything defined under
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/list_authors ?

What i would like to acheive (the bigger picture) is to have a block in the
right panel which lists all blog authors  with links to page which lists
all posts
made by the author with any attributed comments

As this only day 2 for me in using wordpress any guidance from you guys
would be very much appreciated.

Thanks in advance

That is what list_authors allows you to achieve.

Something like the following in the sidebar.php of your theme should get 
you what you want:

            <li><h2>Authors</h2>
                <ul>
                <?php list_authors(FALSE,FALSE,); ?>
                </ul>
            </li>

Your questions will be better and quicker answered if you post on the 
support forum - http://wordpress.org/support/

This list is more about core WordPress development than developing a 
site with WordPress.

"The META declaration must only be used when the character encoding is
organized such that ASCII-valued bytes stand for ASCII characters (at
least until the META element is parsed).
/META declarations should appear as early as possible in the HEAD

Thanks for your attention and energy on this problem.

So, it seems that permalinks are actually working (even though they
don't) -- so that's not the problem.

I wonder if it might be something in my httpd.conf... Here's the lines I
think may be relevant... Can you take a look at them to verify that I've
got things correctly configured? Thanks!

Change this:

DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of #
features.
#
<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>

To this:

DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of #
features.
#
<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>

That tells apache to process the .htaccess file. I don't know if it will
make any difference. Your .htaccess file is being processed, as evident by
the output logs. It could be that the file was being processed, but Apache
wasn't actually reading the output since overrides was denied.

I noticed you have it further down in the config file, but it could actually
be that having it in there twice is screwing with apache.

Another quick test you can do is make a short and easy plugin that dumps the
rewrite array. Just make a quick text/php file with this in it:

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Dump Permalink Structure
Plugin URI: 
Version: 
Description: 
Author:
Author URI:  
*/

add_filter("rewrite_rules_array", keywords_createRewriteRules,10);

function keywords_createRewriteRules($rewrite) {

	echo "<pre>";
	print_r($rewrite);
	echo "</pre>";
	return $rewrite
}
?>

Then upload it to your plugins and activate it. It will dump the rewrite
array on the top of every page, so you don't want to keep it activated long.
Try getting rid of the /index.php/ in your rewrite rules then reload the
page and make sure that the /index.php/ is gone from the beginning of the
rewrites. If it isn't then you got a query cache that is throwing the monkey
wrench in everything.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Help needed with two issues on established WP install
Message-ID: <E7340445E0595A418B2F8DE0AE480E200D595D6B@ucmail6.ad.uc.edu>

I made the change to httpd.conf and did "service httpd restart". The
site worked normally, so I went to
www.drewvogel.com/wp-admin/options.php and edited the
"permalink_structure" field to remove "/index.php", clicked "Update
Structure" to save changes. Just for grins, I did another "service httpd
restart". Visiting the site, I got a non-WP 404. I went to
Options->Permalink and clicked "Update Permalink Structure" with the
same result -- a broken site with non-WP 404.

I went BACK to www.drewvogel.com/wp-admin/options.php and added
"/index.php" to the permalink_structure field and saved changes. The
site was still broken and I had to empty and restore the database to get
it working again.

I tried your plugin, but after activating it, the screen went white and
the only way to get it back was to delete the plugin. Perhaps something
is wrong in there?

Would it not be easier to just send the content-type in the header?

I don't know what else to look for. You either got a server problem going on
or a problem being caused by a plugin or a bad wordpress install. Since you
got a white screen with that plugin I wrote, I would almost have to say it
is something server related. I just tried that plugin code on my clean
install of wp2.0.4 and it dumped the array out on the permalinks page. 

Your htaccess is fine, as evident from the rewrite log dumps. Since your
having to dump the database and restore it to get the site working again, I
am still going with the suspicion that you have some kind of query caching
going on in MySql that is messing with everything.

The simplest route to troubleshoot it from here is to deactivate all
plugins. Set your permalink structure and see if it works. If it doesn't
then go through your server files and disable all caching (opcode, apache
2.2 caching and mysql caching), then see if it is working again. Once you
get it to the point that it is working, reactivate every thing one by one,
starting with the server changes first then going to the plugins and testing
it between each step to find out what is causing the problem.

It is obvious the problem isn't in the Wordpress core, considering the
number of sites running 2.0.4. (I personally handle 11 WP sites running
2.0.4 with now problems on all kinds of different servers/configurations).
If it were in Wordpress then we would have seen a rush of tickets put in on
it LOL.

If I recall, wp already does that. I've never liked the content-type
meta element.

Subject: [wp-hackers] web2x: new plugin for semantic publishing
Message-ID: <70055a110608251259l4acd1cdawfb12802df8e90ab6@mail.gmail.com>

I finally released web2x version 0.1, a plugin for wordpress that adds
semantic publishing features geared toward the research community. Thanks
for everyone who answered my questions on this list, particularly Mark.

A demo installation is at http://web2express.org/demo/.
You can try the new features there - publish any research or product info.

http://web2express.org is a real world example of using the web2x publishing
tool, where I have just started to self-publish my experiments in semantic
web research.

web2x publishing software is an open source project on sourceforge.net,
https://sourceforge.net/projects/web2x/.  I would like to invite anyone
who's interested in making an impact on  the upcoming revolution in
scientific publishing to join the open source development.

This tool is one of many pieces required to create a new scientific
publishing model.
Another piece is open ontology standards, for which I'm engaged in a
w3c task force <http://esw.w3.org/topic/HCLS/ScientificPublishingTaskForce>
to develop.
Wordpress is a great foundation for testing new semantic publishing
ideas. If you are excited
by the potential of semantic web, please let me know.

cheers,
AJ

It's good to include it in the file as well, so if for example someone 
saved a file to their hard drive there would still be the proper 
encoding embedded. (I think that's the idea.)

Hello,

Does WordPress really need a dependency on .htaccess?  Couldn't
functionality that currently requires it be done with a router that handles
all requests and returns the proper view(s)?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Widget definitions inside classes
Message-ID: <44EFAA59.9040307@jamietalbot.com>

Hi,

I'd like to keep code to define a widget and its control neatly inside a class definition, but it
doesn't seem to be possible.  Has anyone found a way to do this?  There doesn't seem to be a
mechanism for doing so, like exists for filters and actions.

register_sidebar_widget('Languages', 'MyClass::my_language_widget');

doesn't work, and would be no good anyway as it would be a static function and there's no $this
available.

register_sidebar_widget('MyWidget', array(& $this, 'my_widget'));

like

add_filter('the_content', array(& $this, 'my_the_content_filter'));

would be useful.

Cheers,

Jamie.

How would this "router" work and how would it be more compatible than 
mod_rewrite?

I'm thinking of something like Zend Controller Rewrite Router, part of the
nascent Zend Framework.
<http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.rewriterouter.html>

To me, the dependence on .htaccess seems like one of the more fragile parts
of the system.  I had to modify several lines just to put WordPress in
site.com/wp instead of site.com/wordpress, I had to add a few more lines to
support FeedBurner, and I've had to add a few hundred lines to to support
permalink changes.  It seems like losing the dependence on .htaccess would
make it easier to run WordPress on non-Apache servers, would allow a new
class of "router" plug-ins to be created, etc.

I'm not sure why you had to make manual edits, but WordPress certainly
isn't dependent on .htaccess or mod_rewrite.

The default, non-verbose rewrite rules[1] simply pass all requests to
index.php. WordPress looks up its internal store of rewrite rules
(i.e. routes) and maps the request URL on to the matching resource, or
serves a 404 if nothing matches. It's already very flexible with
regard to plugins modifying or extending those rules.

It's not .htaccess or mod_rewrite dependent because you can use any
other mechanism to pass the incoming URLs to WordPress. The "almost
pretty" (index.php-prefixed) URLs use PATH_INFO. You can set WordPress
as a 404 handler and map them that way.

I don't understand exactly what behaviour it is that you're hoping to
change. Can you provide more details?

[1]: e.g.

# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /wordpress/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /wordpress/index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress

That's very similar to what we already do. Note that rewriterouter has a 
dependency on mod_rewrite as well.  It requires the same bootstrap lines 
in htaccess that are required by WP, Textpattern, and every other bit of 
software that does it's own rewriting.

There are plenty of router plugins for WP.  With the proper plugins, 
there is no need to touch htaccess.

And as already noted, WP can rewrite from PATH_INFO or from a 404 handler.

Exactly.  It's good for a lot of reasons.  Unfortunately I can't track
down the websites where I gleaned this little bit of knowledge from
(content-type before title).  I ran into the info a couple times while
reading-up on getting my plugins to handle extended character sets.
The page Paul listed says the content-type meta should be listed in
the HEAD section as soon as possible, although it doesn't specifically
say it should be the first thing.

Oh well, it's not that big of a deal.

There are plugins that handle the feedburner issue.  There's no need
to hack WP for that.  Even if you didn't want to use the plugins, you
could make changes to your theme files, which doesn't qualify as a
hack.

For my Popularity Contest plugin I created a nice neat class, then  
added functions for all the methods I needed to call from hooks:

function foo() {
	global $my;
	$my->foo();
}

Not really an elegant solution, but not the worst thing in the world  
either as the functions require zero maintenance.

I think what you're looking for is:

register_sidebar_widget('MyWidget', array('MyClass', 'my_widget'));

You can call static class methods using array('TheClass', 'TheMethod')

Message-ID: <5ec14d0608260729p10d892c7t9db85a6f07416bfc@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy all,
Recently I was working on a plugin that had only a single
configuration option.  To me, it seems like overkill to have to create
a menu for just one option.

I looked through the source code, and I didn't spot any do_action()s
in the options menu, or the other menus (besides the write page).
Does something like that exist?  If not, are there any plans to add
them?  Given a choice, I'd rather just append my one lonely option to
the bottom of the options menu, then create a unique menu for the
plugin.

.htaccess shouldn't be an issue, it's actually both the easiest and most elegant way of handling the
complex (and nearly infinite) permalink possibilities available through wp. anything special you'd
need beyond that would not require modification to core, only (as previously mentioned) your theme
files and/or a plugin.

Granted, the lack of mod_rewrite in the windows world does a nice job of
marginilizing that thought when not in a *AMP world.  Well, without adding "
index.php" into the permalink structure.

Sure, there are some interesting work-arounds.  But for "joe user" they're
not all that approachable.

mod_rewrite runs fine on Apache under Windows. I think you're
confusing IIS with windows.

No confusion.

"when not in a *AMP world" would be IIS.  A = Apache.

For all of the reasons I mentioned in my post.  There's no FeedBurner
plug-in that supports the recommended "temporary redirect" method (in which
you /don't/ move or redirect your feed URL), required if you want people to
continue to subscribe to and use site.com/feed/.  I just learned about a
plug-in that can handle future post slug renaming, but there's none I can
find that gives me a nice UI to map any URL to any other URLs (necessary to
map all of those old Movable Type URLs to WordPress).  There's apparently no
way around editing .htaccess if you want to put WordPress in a folder other
than /wordpress.

I think the problem should be obvious, at least to anyone who doesn't make
money solving these kinds of issues.  You have users and WordPress (and
WordPress plug-ins, from what I've just heard) all fighting over the same
Apache-specific plaintext file to do even the most basic stuff.

Charles,
It would be helpful if you offered an alternative solution.  All the
content management systems that I know of use the .htaccess file to
provide pretty URLs.  It doesn't seem fair to blame WordPress for
using the file, with a "how dare you!" air, when that's the standard
all across the web.

Perhaps someone will write such a plugin.

Huh?  I never put WP in /wordpress and never have to do anything to 
htaccess.

We have a rewrite API that plugins can use that avoids requiring 
modification of htaccess.   That API can certainly be improved if it 
doesn't provide something a plugin needs to get the job done.

Ha!  You can tell I'm in "how dare you!" mode when I use the <armsAkimbo>
tag.   :O)

Seriously, the solution I offered yesterday was to implement a router that
handled all requests, then constraining the use of .htaccess to route all
requests to that router.  The .htaccess file in this case might look like
this:

	RewriteEngine on
	RewriteRule !\.(js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css)$ index.php

I noticed that you're using CakePHP, and CakePHP (like most frameworks)
works the way I'm describing -- minimal .htaccess changes plus a router to
handle requests.  IMHO, using .htaccess for more than minimal server
configuration is a practice that should be avoided if possible.

I believe that replacing the use of .htaccess with a flexible, extensible
router would (1) make WordPress more portable (to IIS, for example), (2)
make WordPress easier to use (I learned quickly that one mistake in an
.htaccess file can take down your site, or worse, create unexpected and
hard-to-debug results), and (3) make WordPress more reliable (if plug-ins
didn't have to mess with plaintext files to extend/enhance routing).

This is my last post on this particular topic.  I mostly just wanted to put
the thought into people's heads for now.

P.S.  Great plug-ins and cheat sheet, Sean!

(1) WP does the best it can to support IIS with permalinks, The rest
is IIS's fault.
(2) See (3)

If it's IIS's fault that it's not Apache, then yeah, it's IIS's fault.

Why do they, then?  (Example: WP FeedBurner)

MathML, but:

I thought this had been said enough, but I guess not. WP does not need
rewriting to do its permalinks. WP does not need rewriting to do its
permalinks. A 404 handler is plenty to get WP's permalinks to work
fine (thus, WP with pretty permalinks can work fine in lighttpd as
well).

Setting wp's index.php as a 404 handler in IIS should work. If it
doesn't, I may have just stumbled across a one-line patch to fix the
solution (setting $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'] = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
under IIS (line 34 in wp-settings.php should do it). If this doesn't
work, then what can we do? Tell people to install a 3rd-party rewriter
just for IIS and then write 20 scripts to output 20 different formats
for IIS. Everyone's time would be better spent working on new
features.

Ask the author. Also a possible lack of proper documentation (also
something I may have to volunteer to do).

So the solution you're really after is wordpress .NET, maybe you could start up a .NET branch of WP
to solve IIS related issues, rather than messing with the core of what's really a pretty nimble
system already, in order to get it to work *correctly* on that platform. As previously mentioned,
the existing wordpress .htaccess requirements are really quite unobtrusive, and unlimited
flexibility is already obtained by using an internal API for processing the re-writes. I've been
away from the MS/IIS backend systems for a while now, however I don't believe that anyone wishing to
obtain the highest level of performance and scalability possible (using a wordpress like cms type
system anyway) would choose to do it via the MS platform. 

Making major modifications to the core behaviors of the existing WP system at this point in order to
address a small segment of users would likely be counter productive. I think that overall most users
are more than happy and comfortable with the system as it is.

It could also be pre WP2.0+ plugins (before the rewrite was redone). I have
notched some out there that work on 2.0, but use the old 1.5 .htaccess
hacks. That is nothing really up to WP to take care of. The plugin author
should decide when/if to modify to 2.0.

As far as putting a "router" in the mix, why? To me that is adding one more
bend in the pipe before the final outcome is produced. You can do a simple
hook into the rewrite array via a plugin to add urls, or rewrite feed urls
from other platforms. Simple script to handle Userland style feeds:

<?
add_filter("rewrite_rules_array", AddUserlandFeed(),1);

function AddUserlandFeed ($rewrite) {
	$new_rules['rss.xml']= 'index.php&feed=rss2';
	return ( $rewrite + $new_rules );
}
?>

Activate plugin then update permalinks and you're done. You can now access
your feed via http://yourdomain.com/rss.xml It isn't pretty, but it works.

Perhaps if someone has the energy or time, they could develop a series of
plugins to convert the different feed locations for different platforms to
work on Wordpress. Just offer a plugin version for each one (ie. Userland,
MT, Blogger). 

Of course depending on the environment your in, some people try to stay
clear of every plugin they can. For one site I did, I ended up just doing a
mod_rewrite to handle the old system feeds (this site averages 2-5 million
feed reads per day). When you consider adding in a plugin and that code
having to be compiled everytime WP starts (unless you're running opcode
caching), it makes more sense to let .htaccess handle it.

*Almost works. Let me try that again for you.

add_filter('rewrite_rules_array', 'AddUserlandFeed');
function AddUserlandFeed($rewrite) {
	$rewrite['rss.xml'] = 'index.php?feed=rss2';
	return $rewrite;
}
register_activation_hook(__FILE__, 'UserlandFeedFlushRules');
function UserlandFeedFlushRules() {
    global $wp_rewrite;
    $wp_rewrite->flush_rules();
}

Actually, as it currently is WP will outperform mod_rewrite with its
internal rewriter (1.5 compared to 2.0). Why? Simple, 99.99% of people
using WP are putting what they want for the old permalinks in
.htaccess. That file must also be parsed on every page load, and a
study has shown that putting rewrites in httpd.conf actually greatly
improves overall performance. Really, it makes sense to let PHP handle
it :).

No.  To summarize again, this thread is about one idea for improving
WordPress -- specifically, reducing its dependence on an easy-to-muck-up
file meant for server configuration rather than application configuration.

A router just takes a URI and parses it to understand how to respond.
WordPress already has one if it's handling customized permalink structures
without a dependence on .htaccess.

Yes, you can delete the crap. Hell, I recommend deleting the file and
using the admin interface to generate a new one.

Message-ID: <d9b01a0608262008r3d5b52ecr83452f4dfc1bf641@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there folks,

I've been getting some bug reports about WP-Cats which trace back to
the get_currentuserinfo call. Given that this is kind of a volatile
override-able function, maybe it's not the best mechanism for locking
out non-admins/editors from plugin functionality.

Is there some other way to do the lockout, that won't be affected by
other plugins hijacking that function?

Is there some other condition that could cause the "stock" version of
the function to not set the global $userdata? (This is in Ajax calls
from within the admin interface, so the logged-in cookie is definitely
being sent back, and it works in some configurations and not
others...)

Thanks,

Mike

Awesome, I appreciate the advice and your patience, Robert.  That should pretty much null and void why I brought it up in the first place.   :^)

Based on my quick glance at wp-cats-0.12...

Isn't the appropriate thing there `current_user_can('edit_post', $post_id)` ?

Also, the way you're doing it now (reading
`$userdata->wp_capabilities`) only works if the table prefix is 'wp_'.

Thanks for that, though, as I mentioned before, static methods are no use in this case because I'd
like access to $this.  Guess it's not possible - will probably encapsulate it as Alex suggested with
a wrapper function.  This would be a nice addition to the Widgets plugin, though...

Then I guess I'm just confused.  The following code works fine for me.

class MyPlugin {
	function MyPlugin() {
		register_sidebar_widget('My Plugin', array(&$this, 'show'));
	}
	function show() {
		// Do something here
	}
}

Heh, and now it works for me too...  I must've screwed something else up somewhere along the line.

Would be good to reduce confusion.  Another bag of worms that is  
confusing as heck is get_bloginfo().  There's also this little bit of  
insanity in get_bloginfo() that has been driving me nuts for years:

get_bloginfo('siteurl') == get_option('home')    ?!

That's seriously dysfunctional... especially considering how many  
plugin authors don't know the difference and write plugins that  
assume that your WP install URL and blog URL are the same.

There have been some 3rd party solutions for this issue, although I

I've been itching for some better options-related plugin-dev

Options" page that people can add on to, is that it's not exactly  
intuitive to look there.  Misc Options is the place I look when I  
can't find an option anywhere else... so it's the last place I'd look.

My problem is that creating an options page for only one option is a  
lot of work for a little payoff.  What I really want is a WP core  
method of quickly creating an options page.

$abcd_option_page = new WP_Options_Page('abcd');
$abcd_option_page->checkbox('Some Option', 'someoption', '1');

That sort of thing.  Obviously it can't encompass the most  
complicated option pages which might need their own JavaScript or  
whatever... but for most plugins, something like that would help out  
plugin authors a lot.

Ugh, that drives me nuts to no end. So many plugins break on my site 
(WordPress installed to /wordpress/) because they are written by noobs 
who don't know to use wpurl. :(

Message-ID: <A488007A-AEEC-4C3B-8B1D-596BA4A7ECBC@yellowswordfish.com>

(I did put this on the forum but got no takers and am still tearing  
my hair out trying to solve it!)

I maintain a duplicate of my public site on my MacBook (running same  
AMP versions as my public host). I built this originally just by  
copying my site to my local machine, dumping my database, mass  
editing the IP address instances in the DB dump and re-applying.  
Works every time. Then I upgraded the local site to 2.1 to start  
testing it and to write a couple of plugins I am playing with.

Yesterday I decided to completely re-build again from scratch.  
Everything went well (and works as it should) except it refused to  
load at first. I eventually traced it to three of the 15 odd plugins  
I use. At every attempt to activate one of these (like, for example,  
Owen Winklers 'Comment Quicktags') instead of the header I would  
expect ('/plugins.php?activate=true') the system immediately dies and  
the header is:

	/plugins.php? 
action=activate&plugin=comment_quicktags&_wpnonce=cd31e53bfa

(for example).

These plugins work fine on my site and on another duplicate I keep on  
a different machine and worked on this setup before I rebuilt. They  
are not corrupted. comment quicktags, in particular, doesn't even do  
anything that weird. If anyone out there has any ideas what I am  
missing the info would be gratefully appreciated.

Message-ID: <44F1E5AA.4020802@magicfly.nl>

Hi,

For my blog I use nested comments. (example: 
http://sillymidget.com/index.php/2006/07/10/dimensies-inbeelden-voor-dummies/#comments)

I can do everything with the template since wordpress already supports 
parent_ID for comments for some reason. The only thing that's missing 
are 2 lines in wp-comments-post.php that pass on the form data to the 
wp_new_comment function (patch attached):

$comment_parent = (int) $_POST['comment_parent_ID'];

and

$commentdata = compact('comment_post_ID', 'comment_author', 
'comment_author_email', 'comment_author_url', 'comment_content', 
'comment_type', 'comment_parent', 'user_ID');


Maybe this can be commited to the svn repository?



Kind regards,

Joris

Nested comments were (are) available via plugin, but personally I would love
to see the option available as a core function so that I don't have to rely
on plugin authors to update their work as WP evolves. I suppose there was
(is?) a good reason why this isn't in the core, but it gets a +1 from the

I could recall a discussion about this and found it.

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-May/000863.html

 From what I can gather, nested comments were said to add complexity  
(Drupal, Nuke and many other packages have that built in). I  
personally think it should be left to the Webmatser to decide what's  
more suitable. And nested comments should probably not be there by  
default... as it's easier to harness extra complexity, as opposed to  
stripping it.

Best wishes,

Roy

In the Comment manager,  Mass Edit and View modes are so similar, I   
wonder why there's a View mode at all. Why not just dump that and  
have Mass Edit be the default/only? And why not a batch "Mark as  
Spam" option on the Mass Edit page? And why no pagination to view  
earlier comments in either view?

Are these features waiting to happen, or are there reasons why they  
are the way they are?

Thanks,

Good call.  I agree nested comments should be left up to a plugin.  If
the comments table already has a parent ID, then maybe the devs have
something up their sleeves, or they put it in there "just in case".
Either way, I'd prefer that WP was minimalist, and left more advanced
things up to plugins.

It's there so there is a standard way of marking comment  
relationships.  That way, if one "threaded comments" plugin falls  
into disrepair, you can just use another one, and your comment  
relationships will need no conversion.  I seriously doubt there are  
any plans on putting it into core.

Much in the same way, there is also a post_comment_filtered column in  
the posts table.  WP has never used it, but it can (and has) been  
used by plugin authors to store rendered versions of post content  
(after the curly quotes and paragraphing and whatever filters you  
have running on the_content... same way TextPattern stores both raw  
and textile2-processed text).

Hi Folks

Well - no ideas or solutions came forth but - just for the record - I  
solved it.
Owen and the other two plugin authors had used short php tags and my  
short tags were turned off having re-installed php.
Simple and very annoying. Didn't expect to find those.

Sorry I am a little slow to responding to this thread. I think these 3 steps
are neccessary for a good user experience.

I think the way to get the best of both worlds is:
1.) AJAX delegator register each event by assigning a unique id to each AJAX
event.
2.) Have a default timeout for the delegator so if the callback has not
happened in this time period throw a message to the user.
3.) If the server throws an error throw the same error.

This could be taken farther, by having a rollback feature assigned with each
event that clones the effected nodes and if the error is called the cloned
items are replaced. However this would require changing how all AJAX methods
are updated currently and is probably overkill for Wordpress.

Well, knowing AMP is an acronym and not another software package makes a
number of posts a lot clearer.  I've always assumed it was some software
package I've never heard of.  The acronym isn't used all that often on this
list.

Just, in case there are any other people on this list who have also wandered
what the heck this AMP software is:

AMP = Apache/MySQL/PHP
AMPP = Apache/MySQL/PHP/PERL

* could be  L for Linux or W for Windows

Thus LAMP or WAMP are also common acronyms.

And this explains the naming of the XAMPP package which has different
flavors for the operating
systems..._______________________________________________

Message-ID: <44F304CF.7080703@nytimes.com>

Hi everyone

My employer is asking me to write a plugin that substantially alters the
way WP serves pages.  I need a reliable way to handle errors in the
comments posting process.  If you open up wp-comments-post.php, you'll
see a handy do_action() call just before every die(); great... until you
get down to line 34 or so, where suddenly the action calls stop, and the
script is dying w/out any chance to intercept the error condition.

Is there any compelling reason why I shouldn't just add extra
do_action() calls for these cases and submit the patch back to Trac?  I
have been trying to do everything through the plugin call exclusively,
but in this case I don't think I can avoid patching core.  The
conditions I'm trying to trap are a missing name/email address or an
invalid email address.  Or is there some subtlety here that I'm missing?

Thanks

I think the new wp_die function, which debuts in WordPress 2.1, should
take care of this.

That's cool! Now that I know and understand that, I'm not of the mind that
it should be core-included. Thanks for the information, Mark.

*ahem*

You're forgetting

AMPPP = Apache/MySQL/PHP/Perl/Python, for all those TurboGears users out
there. *grin*

Additionally, don't bother with XAMPP if you're running a Mac like me -
the Mac version is painfully out of date when compared to the other code
drops.  Opt for MAMP instead - like XAMPP, but with a lot less cruft
(basically, Apache, MySQL, PHP and SQLite).

A)  /me tears up that the Dark Tower series ended.

B)  Sorry for the confusion around LAMP/WAMP.  When tossing around acronyms
I really need to not ASSuME that everyone knows what they mean.

OK, good to know.  We can probably deal with our own patches until 2.1
comes out.

Hi Scot,

This  was discussed on several occasions in the past  (among
them:  http://tinyurl.com/l26a4 ). Contexts I can  remember:
(1)  not  enough comments per page (e.g. to handle a lot  of
SPAM);  (2) No fine control over number of comments per page
(I  changed the source a long time ago, but  hidden/advanced
options  would have helped); (3) No pagination; (4) No  AJAX
control  for  quick deletion; (5) No batch-mode deletion  or
keyboard navigation; (6) Various issues to do with filtering
and flagging...

I  don't  know  if there are any plugins  that  improve  the
moderation  side  (back  end  plugins seem  more  likely  to
break), but I agree that the usability could be improved and
the  two types of moderation pages merged, e.g. use some  JS
to  un/fold  comment  contents,  so that  links  needn't  be
followed.   Then  come  accessibility  issues  and  keyboard
navigation, etc.

Best wishes,

Roy

it would be nice to be able to load ALL comments on one page (or  
paged) for a specific post item as well as sometimes it is helpful to  
prune them. I end up doing direct database deletes which is far  
quicker (and sooner or later the lack of referential integrity (on  
the comment count) catches up)..

hello all,
maybe it is a stupid questions, but anyway I'll try to post it here.

I'm looking to enlarge the ajax box which displays the available 
categorys (box on the right)
on the edit/post screen.
Does anyone of you know where I can find the js code, php code so that I 
can adjust this
for my wp installation?

kind regards & thx

At the bottom of wp-admin.css, add this line:

#categorydiv #categorychecklist { height: 300px; }

Alternatively, you can package it as a trivial plugin, like so:
<http://uwmike.com/wp-content/plugins/category-box-height.php.source>

You may also like using WP-Cats for category management.

Thanks for the plugin idea. I've *cough* borrowed that for my own Post page
CSS customisation. One less thing to edit next time I upgrade :)

Indeed - nice solution.
Doesn't seem to work with the latest build of 2.1 though. Have we  
lost the 'admin_head' hook?

Please don't take my lack of posting as anything other than my schedule
has gotten very full in the last several days!

I still intend to follow the instructions we generated (from ALL these
posts!) to the letter to see if it fixes this issue.

The guidance is appreciated, and I will test these things out as my

Message-ID: <44F49837.5000102@boren.nu>

The bug hunt we discussed on the testers list is coming up in about 5 hours.

http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=8&day=30&year=2006&hour=1&min=0&sec=0&p1=0

Drop by if you have some time to kill.  The focus is 2.1.  We'll try to 
commit as many outstanding patches as we can, whip up some new patches, 
and do some triage of trac.  As usual, we'll try to keep things going 
for 24 hours so that all time zones can participate.

Hi Andy,

Which plugins? I would like to make sure there are bugs filed in
http://dev.wp-plugins.org/ if they are "hosted" there.

Thank you,
Lloyd

Sure thing  but I'm unsure whether they are hosted there. These were:

(1)   'Comment Quicktags' (Owen Winkler)
(2)   'WP-OnlineCounter' (Jan Grewe)
(3)   and the third was in the 'Brians Threaded Comments' code file  
of Paged Threaded Comments (Zhou Qingbo)

http://redalt.com/wiki/Comment+Quicktags
http://faked.org/blog/wp-onlinecounter/
http://www.qingbo.org/blog/?p=54

Brians Threaded Comments also uses the $tabecomments variable but it  
is not alone on that one! The remainder of the Paged Threaded  
Comments code was fine.

You mean `comment_parent`, right?

The old hack for threaded comments in WordPress 0.x used a
`comment_reply_ID` field, which got picked up by the "Brian's Threaded
Comments" plugin. The comments table is altered to add the field if
it's not found. All the other threaded comments plugins I've looked at
seem to be based on Brian's, so they use `comment_reply_ID` too.

Hooray for standards! :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to create posts via SQL queries
Message-ID: <3573b1770608311421h28b27502j8166a6cba0515552@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

*My current WP configuration :*
*- WordPress* release : 2.0.4
*- Theme* : default
*- Plugins * : none
*- Provider* : ovh

*Issue :*
I try to insert posts with the queries such as ones defined below.

Queries are successful because  I can see the posts in the admin console.
Unfortunately, I can see them in the blog.

If I create posts via admin, everything is OK,

It is sure there is something wrong  but I do not  know what. [image: blink]

Thanks in advance for any information

These are my queries :

       $wpdb->query("
            INSERT INTO $wpdb->posts (    ID, post_author, post_date,
post_date_gmt, post_content, post_title, post_category, post_excerpt,
post_status, comment_status, ping_status,
                                    post_password, post_name, to_ping,
pinged, post_modified, post_modified_gmt, post_content_filtered,
post_parent, guid, menu_order,
                                    post_type, post_mime_type, comment_count)
            VALUES (    $articleID, 1, '$dateJour', '$dateJour',
'$texte','$post_title',0,'','publish','open',
                    'open','','" .
sanitize_title(utf8_decode($data[1])) . '-' . $data[2] . "','','',
'$dateJour','$dateJour','',0,'$blogURL/?p=$articleID',0,'','',0)
        ");
       $wpdb->query("
            INSERT INTO $wpdb->post2cat (post_id, category_id)
            VALUES ($articleID, " . $categories[$data[0]] . ")
       ");

At first glance I see that you are using the same time for your post_date
and post_date_gmt.  Unless you're in England, chance are such that those two
are not likely to be the same as each other on your server.  Might it be
that your post is not showing up, on the front page, simply because your
server time hasn't yet reached the value you have in the $dateJour variable?
