Subject: [wp-hackers] map_meta_cap returns empty array for edit_post
Message-ID: <CAOwx47fErp7mmcd0XeaFt9GBjoRFNsS8hynE404MZF6118g5Tg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to conditionally set post-related capabilities and I'm surprised
to see that in certain situations that fails.

I believe the culprit is the map_meta_cap function(since in
WP_User::has_cap() $caps is an empty array). The post in question is in the
trash and I'd like to forbid certain users to restore the post. The problem
is with the following check (
https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/4.0-branch/wp-includes/capabilities.php#L1139
):

...
} elseif ( 'trash' == $post->post_status ) {
if ( 'publish' == get_post_meta( $post->ID, '_wp_trash_meta_status', true )
) {
$caps[] = $post_type->cap->edit_published_posts;
}
} else {
...

If the _wp_trash_meta_status is not publish, then no actual capability is
mapped to the requested one. Hence WP_User::has_cap() returns true and it's
impossible to filter the capability.

Is this the intended behaviour, or is this a bug that somehow managed to
sneak-in? If it's a bug, then I'll post a ticket on Track, but if it's not
I'd be curious to hear why it works that way.

All the best,
Nikola

Greetings all,

I've been testing WP 4.1, and there's one new feature I can't quite
understand:
Clicking an image shows a new toolbar that adds left, right, center, and
no-align to the edit/delete buttons. Clicking these buttons seems to do the
same thing as clicking left, center, right align, or untoggling the current
selected (no-align) on the normal toolbar.

Is this feature redundant, or am I missing something? Are users not
connecting the use of align with selection of image?

Best regards,
Luke
