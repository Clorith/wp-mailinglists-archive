Hey Dino,

I use ajax quite a bit in many plugins. One of the things that I noticed is
you have closed-**postboxes in the first part of your add_action, and
closed_postboxes in your second half. Make sure that your ajax request uses
the right one. I've done silly things like that before. Secondly, make sure
that you put a "die();" at the end of your called php function
closed_postboxes(){}.

Hope that helps,

Kevin

You can check the error log for a better error, hopefully, but ... Uh. Yeah, start with fewer images/post types on that page! I'm be putting money on memory, but with a smaller selection (and pagination) you can narrow it down to see if it's because there's no image on the page or not.

Hey Dino,

I use ajax quite a bit in many plugins. One of the things that I noticed is
you have closed-**postboxes in the first part of your add_action, and
closed_postboxes in your second half. Make sure that your ajax request uses
the right one. I've done silly things like that before. Secondly, make sure
that you put a "die();" at the end of your called php function
closed_postboxes(){}.

Hope that helps,

Kevin

Thank you Rafael and Kevin. FWIW, the problem in my case was that I had 
forgotten to pass the nonce as a hidden field.

Thanks Mika,

Do you think that too much posts/query itens ruin WordPress or ajax thing?! 
This site uses ajax to load itens per request, but that don't seems to work 
in such amount. :(

I'm struggling to convinve the user that 1185 posts at once is way too much.

Message-ID: <CAC3yCwq+YqQ6Oq-GiVLYmROuoJ6U+0NWq2RqoQSxiMjGGXQHSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I know there was a similar topic earlier last month, but it was more
focused on having the same database. I have a 100% independent development
site. I need to import a bunch of page updates simultaneously from the dev
site to the live site. WP-impoter will not work because the pages currently
exists. I'm thinking about modifying/hooking the importer and trying to
make it to overwrite my current pages.

I looked for other plugins that would help me sync my dev site to my live
site. I can't just do a database dump because there are multiple things
(users/posts/media/comments/etc) that are on the live site that need to
stay.

Anyone have any tips or solutions for syncing dev pages to live pages?

Thanks,
Matt

The wp_load_image() function is only called in the WP core when you are
doing an image resize or crop. If you are loading that many images as once
you should not be doing realtime resizing/cropping. Can you figure out a
way to save these images and then just put the image as standard HTML
instead of creating them dynamically?

Maybe there is something else going on, but it is hard to tell.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Filtering the default in get_option()
Message-ID: <CAJ1998UP1iFEiMPYE2t3j0gXF9MtqD7SHfqWzyW59S--BdZ7pA@mail.gmail.com>

get_option() supports two filters: pre_option_$option and option_$option.
I'd like to filter the options for a plugin, which in this case is stored
as a single serialized array. I was hoping to lock in certain option values
and let the plugin UI handle the rest, but pre_option_$option overrides all
options saved in the database, and option_$option won't run if the option
record does not yet exist in the database. I could probably accomplish this
modifying option filters on the fly (filter on pre_option_, disable filter
and get_option again, modify the value from the database).

As far as patches go, was there ever talk of running the option_$option
filter on the $default value of the function?

 Guys, I need to add a link to the class generated by next_post_link
previous_post_link and I saw that for next_posts_link can do this with the
filter next_posts_link_attributes, but ran the codex and did not find one
similar to next_post_link.

Any help in this regard?

Hi Leo,

The two functions next_post_link and previous_post_link use actually the
same one called adjacent_post_link.
This function provide one unique filter: "{$adjacent}_post_link" where
$adjacent value will be "next" or "previous" based on the caller.

The value you'll filter with it will be the entire generated HTML code (<a
href...>Title</a>), so you will be able to add your own classes by doing a
str_replace or so on that value.

You could also add a wrapper for those functions in your theme, as
twentyeleven is doing in the single.php template:
<span class="nav-previous"><?php previous_post_link( '%link', __( '<span
class="meta-nav">&larr;</span> Previous', 'twentyeleven' ) ); ?></span>

In that case, a CSS rule with something like ".nav-previous a" will trigger
your link.

Hope that helps.
Lionel

Hi everyone,

I have a UI that I am coding that separates  wp_nav_menu() into 3 separate columns.  I am looking to find a way to split this using php or built in WP functionality.  Does someone know how I can split this into 3 columns based on number of items or a similar method.

Thank you,

Hi Dmitry,

See that comment which explains the way the "Walkers" work in WP :
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/14037/menu-items-description/14039#14039

You need exactly that imho : deal with the wp_nav_menu options (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu) and the Walker's
methods to create the menu as you want it to be.

Message-ID: <CAHERW=0JOxkg2cWf7VXzgSJSSNa6-OOMNNd99gy0Wamix-CUHw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working with a fresh install programmatically.

I create taxonomies, terms, posts, on the fly without the dashboard. It's a
process for me with lots of trials and errors.
Many times, I want to start with a fresh slate.

That's where the question is formed. What's the most effective way to bring
the wp to the starting ( well, almost starting ) phase, programmatically?

If I drop the database with a mysql statement, wp would create the tables
and that would give me a fresh slate but that would also blow the bloginfo
and admin user etc.

All I care is to clean the wp_post, post_meta, where terms and taxonomies
stored. no need to clean the options table.
If I delete the records, that does not help cause then my IDs won't start
from 0.

What's a good way to handle this?

One way you could handle this is by installing workpress, set up all
the settings that you need and just backup the table and restore it.

You should be able to write a php script to delete and restore the database.

Adding to what I just said, you could even write a shell scrip that
does the restore for you as well.

Subject: [wp-hackers] lots of category items
Message-ID: <CAHERW=17B5izAxzSiXMYxiH-F9Fut5jmdk-Kjzjj8fK53inHdw@mail.gmail.com>

Let's say this is my cat tree. Though I separated them visually in this
email, they all belong in to the same (built in category) taxonomy.

-----------------------------
media
-----------------------------
-->video         example url for this is: mysite.com/category/media/video
-->audio
-->text
-->photo
-->whatever

-----------------------------
collections
-----------------------------
-->tutorials   example url for this is:
mysite.com/category/collections/tutorials/
-->interviews
-->debates
-->whatever

-----------------------------
audience
-----------------------------
-->beginner  example url for this is: mysite.com/category/audience/beginner
-->intermediate
-->advanced

-----------------------------
topics
-----------------------------

-->culture
------>art
------>food
------>music
------>etc

-->science
------>astronomy
------>computing
------>chemisty
------>etc

-->sports
------>soccer
------>basketball
------>tennis
------>etc

-->feature
------>main headline
------>worth a look
------>must see
------>flagship
------>etc

With that in mind, here is the question.

Because all this data is implemented within the same category taxonomy
system, the corresponding drop down ( the category dropdown that is )
getting extremely inconvenient to work with. This makes the new content
entry process uneffective and not fun at the admin dashboard.

An alternative to this is to use custom taxonomies. I could create 4-5
custom taxonomies such as media, topics, audience, collections, and
feature. As a result of this. I could get 5 or 6 different islands (
dropboxes ) that are each easy to get to. The problem with that would
manifest itself when I run queries that are tapping into those multiple
taxonomies.

Since I expect high traffic and lots of landing pages with a ton of loops,
I do not want to go that route - just for the sake of getting individual
boxes on the admin screen at content entry time.

I do not want to cross multiple taxonomies when pulling posts.

for example from media, get the videos AND intersect that with from
audience the beginners stuff AND intersect that from collections with the
tutorials that are featured as must see... that's too much! isn't it?

When they all belonged in the same cat system, the query gets much
faster/efficient. True?

If so, then what's the solution?

Well, I should be able to break that 100+ item category tree into multiple
boxes that appears to the content entry person as if they were custom
taxonomies but in reality they are not.

How do I achieve that?

some filter? some plug in? how do you go about it?

I'm not at my main computer right now so I can't cook something right
off the top of my head.

All you do is, install wordpress and set up what need to be in every
install (user account and so on)

Then you backup the database with mysql or phpmyadmin (if you got
access to that)

Then you can just use something like mysql -u #username#  -p
#database# < #dump_file# to restore the database.

Why dont you just drag the category metabox to a place with bigger size,
like for an example, below the post editor, that way you'll have plenty of
view area.

You can ask the folks behind Global Voices Online. I've seen their dashboard and it's organized well for a site that has lots of categories. I think Jeremy Clark is one of the WP gurus on the team.

Isn't the only problem that you want to totally reset two tables?

In that case you could write a plugin that does "TRUNCATE TABLE wp_post"
and "TRUNCATE TABLE wp_post_meta".
That will delete all the data and reset the auto_increment values (if you
use any version of MySQL and a MyISM db or MySQL >= 5 and an INNODB db)

Inspired by: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-reset/

I have a theme I use for development that stores the
options/posts/user/whatever, drops the tables, deletes uploads, rebuilds
and inserts the data I want to keep. Not too tricky, but possibly overkill
for hat you want.

If you all you want to do is clear out the posts and postmeta tables, then
truncate is your friend. I'd go with this option from what you describe.

Message-ID: <CAEgmxaY0LxDtWY0Cir1zs5S6dkUTR96b3OiVT0_we+E-tKbxcA@mail.gmail.com>

I have this post status:

  register_post_status( 'archive', array(
    'label'                     => _x( 'Archived', 'post' ),
    'public'                    => false,
    'exclude_from_search'       => true,
    'show_in_admin_all_list'    => false,
    'show_in_admin_status_list' => true
  ) );

Is there any way to get the label to appear anywhere on the WordPress
backend admin?

The filtering works if I update the params, like so:
wp-admin/edit.php?post_status=archive&post_type=paper

Ideally I would restrict this to a particular post type (or set of post
types).

Basically something that will make a difference like between the two images
I attach.
What's the most logical way to achieve this?

Hi Tom,

A post status is applicable to all types of post, regular (WP) types or
even custom types you defined.
When you *set* this status to a particular post, a new "filter" will appear
before the list of posts, near the "All" link and the other statuses.
Indeed, you defined the "show_in_admin_status_list" key to "true" but the
filtering by status is displayed only if there are already some posts with
this status.

That said, you'll need to define a new meta-box or other form stuff so that
you'll be able to set your new status to your custom status, because
WordPress doesn't display new statuses in the core drop down list.

I think you are saying what I was expecting. It is not what I am seeing
though.

I'll leave the post type bit aside for now.

I have 4 posts: 2 draft, 1 publish, 1 archive

I can see: All (3) | Published (1) | Drafts (2)

How do I get it to show either:
 All (3) | Published (1) | Drafts (2) | Registered (1)
or
 All (4) | Published (1) | Drafts (2) | Registered (1)
?

At one point "All (3)" showed all 4 posts. But at no point can I get the
new post status to appear anywhere.

Message-ID: <871uo3d1ax.fsf@newcastle.ac.uk>


I need to change a mime type from "text/javascript" to "text/javascript;
ex4=1". This is to get some javascript working without error in IE9 and
at all in IE8. Unfortunately, the javascript library which requires this
is outside of my control. 

I've wp_enqueue_scripts to add the scripts in the first place. As far as
I can tell Wordpress will not let me fiddle around script tags that are
generated, but I thought I would ask. 

If you have an old version of IE around, you should be able to see the
problem at russet.org.uk/blog.

Ngrk!

Actually, what I had was: "All (3) | Published (1) | Drafts (2) | "

Looking through wp-includes/post-php it seems I am missing the label count.
Which makes the actual answer:

register_post_status( 'archive', array(
  'label'                     => _x( 'Archived', 'post' ),
  'public'                    => false,
  'exclude_from_search'       => true,
  'show_in_admin_all_list'    => false,
  'show_in_admin_status_list' => true,
  'label_count'               => _n_noop( 'Archived <span
class="count">(%s)</span>', 'Archived <span class="count">(%s)</span>' ),
) );

Have updated the codex with the parameter just in case it saves anyone else

Message-ID: <CAEgmxabE-TqDmS4ChtPmNbvUFrCjA_QUs=d5AtmTnK7HODifag@mail.gmail.com>

Having waited 4 months for a reply on the forums, I thought I might ask
here:

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-tag-admin-box-like-categories-without-hierarchy

"I want to register a custom taxonomy, without hierarchy, but have the
back-end work like categories do and not like tags.

That is I want the (tags) to be listed with checkboxes by them (like
categories are), but I don't want hierarchical children available.

Is there a nice way to do this?"

Out of interest, Googling for anything relating to JavaScript and ex4
in the mime type brings up very few relevant results, none of which
explain its use, and just three code examples of that particular mime
type attribute on the entire web. From that I can deduce that your
method of fixing the bug that you're encountering is probably best
solved another way. It seems to me that fixing a JavaScript bug by
changing the mime type is not the right way to go about it. Could you
provide a link to an article explaining the use of this mime type?

The script dependency system in WordPress hard-codes the mime type to
"text/javascript", so no, you can't change this by way of a filter or
an argument currently.

It's easy enough. You just need to remove the default meta box and
then add your own one which uses wp_terms_checklist() to output the
terms.

I've pasted a code example here: http://pastebin.com/MswB57Fn

Hey there,
have been hanging here searching for the problem since an hour at least.
Wrote quite some code and than it didn't work. Didn't even give me an error:

It displayed all columns of my new mysql database table but the last two.
Their names were 1 and 2.
What really freaked me out was they didn't show up this way:

print_r( $wpdb->get_row( "SELECT * FROM " . DBNAME . " WHERE id = '" .
$target. "';", 'ARRAY_A' ) );

But this way:

print_r( $wpdb->get_col_info('type') );

Tested it using SELECT 1, 2 [...] as well, no effect.
I didn't find anything similar online, so I think maybe it is a Wordpress
Bug!?

Subject: [wp-hackers] $wpdb: columns with digit names
In-Reply-To: <CAFtaa=SDTxYt9RruLcg73JdEYipUK4GjYqZFDT968tKdeTtsKw@mail.gmail.com>

First off, for the query, try this code. WP will prepare it correctly for a MySQL query then -

$query = "SELECT * FROM "{DBNAME}" WHERE id = '{$target}'";
print_r( $wpdb->get_row( $wpdb->prepare( $query, ARRAY_A ) ) );

As for the missing columns - a quick search shows that the problem is common, with the solution seeming to be 'change column names to not start with numbers'. Not ideal, but maybe the only option.

Any way, my be worth outputting any errors after the query above to see if you can get some more information from $wpdb -

$wpdb->show_errors();
echo '<pre>$wpdb->last_query: '; print_r($wpdb->last_query); echo '</pre>';
echo '<pre>$wpdb->last_error: '; print_r($wpdb->last_error); echo '</pre>';

If you don't get any information then you know for sure that it is not a query error, so explore the MySQL bug route. If you do get an error, then hopefully it will lead you to an answer.

Hey there,
have been hanging here searching for the problem since an hour at least.
Wrote quite some code and than it didn't work. Didn't even give me an error:

It displayed all columns of my new mysql database table but the last two.
Their names were 1 and 2.
What really freaked me out was they didn't show up this way:

print_r( $wpdb->get_row( "SELECT * FROM " . DBNAME . " WHERE id = '" .
$target. "';", 'ARRAY_A' ) );

But this way:

print_r( $wpdb->get_col_info('type') );

Tested it using SELECT 1, 2 [...] as well, no effect.
I didn't find anything similar online, so I think maybe it is a Wordpress Bug!?

Amazeballs! Thanks John :)

Line 3 needs to be: add_action( 'add_meta_boxes', 'do_my_meta_boxes' );

The WP DB class uses mysql_fetch_object to retrieve each row
(<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/wp-db.php#L1124>).
As a consequence, you can't have columns starting with numbers -- I
imagine mysql_fetch_object ensures that the produced object has valid
class attributes names and that's why these columns don't appear
there.

Additionally, and quite sadly (for me), that doesn't work as is. WordPress
core expects a different data structure for tags than for categories.

Tags: mytaxonomy=Term Name 1,Term Name 2, Term Name 3
Cats: mytaxonomy[]=array(term_id_1, term_id_2, term_id_3)

Small steps :)

Ah yes, you're right. In that case you'll need a custom walker class
which outputs the term name instead of the term ID as the value
attribute on each checkbox. You can then pass that walker class in as
the 'walker' argument to wp_terms_checklist().

hi there :)

My client needs to make something like private forum based on
wordpress. We will create custom post type called 'forum posts' which
will be the same as regular wordpress posts. with one exception: forum
posts will visible only for logged wordpress users

The problem is with attachments. If somebody is familiar with
wordpress he can guess that every attachments are located in
/wp-content/uploads and can guess easy names of files (this will be
job forum so somebody could  try to type /wp-content/uplads/{some date
structures}/cv.doc and it is very possible that this person will get
this file)

How to prevent this? Maybe some .htaccess file which will check if
somebody who try download file is logged wp user with certain role?
but how? or maybe other way?

My recommendation would be to use .htaccess to require authentication for
that directory.

You might also look at WP Document Revisions -- one of its features is:

--
Access Control?- Each document is given a?persistent?URL (e.g.,
yourcompany.com/documents/2011/08/TPS-Report.doc) which can be private
(securely?delivered only to members of your organization), password
protected (available only to those you select such as clients or
contractors), or public (published and hosted for the world to see).
If you catch a typo and upload a new version, that URL will continue
to point to the latest version, regardless of how many changes you
make.
--

Note, this isn't perfect, or 100% secure, in fact. The actual file is
still on your server, with a long name filled with seemingly random
characters. Difficult, but not impossible, to guess.

Also:

"We will create custom post type called 'forum posts' which
will be the same as regular wordpress posts. "

Use CPT to "forum topics" and comments for forum replys to this topic, it
will be much easier to maintain.

just my 2 cents

Awesome find Frank!  Thanks for posting that. I was actually noodling 
over how combine restricted uploading with the member plugin to do this 
for a charity site I'm working with.  I may turn this into a full blown 
plugin.

Thanks!

Haluk:

I'm not sure your presumptions about query performance for multiple taxonomies are correct.

WP3.4 is making some changes in this area that I haven't looked at, but a I think a taxonomy query with multiple terms is same whether or not those terms are in the same taxonomy. By the time the MySQL is generated, it's just a bunch of term_taxonomy_ids, whether those represent category terms or some mix of taxonomies is irrelevant.

It was Otto's article (WordPress 3.1: Advanced Taxonomy Queries) that
suggested me the otherwise.

Cause it ends with this

>Advanced taxonomy queries are cool, but be aware that complex queries are
going to be slower. Not much slower, since the >code does attempt to do

Regarding this very matter, I placed my comment at the of this article (
i'm the last commenter there as of now ) and here it is;
http://ottopress.com/2010/wordpress-3-1-advanced-taxonomy-queries/comment-page-2/#comment-10710

But, from what I understand from you, if at the end of the day it's a bunch
of ids, then yeah, I go all the way with CTs!
However, I don't think that's the case. I think each taxonomy you create
comes back at you as a join in the relavant query.

fruits>apple vs computers>apple
if you do not have two sep taxonomies, you got one apple and one ID.

but if you got two apple context, then, in order to pull those id's you
will involve the taxonomy, you cannot just ask gimme the apples in the
terms table. cause there are two, one as fruit and one as computer. see
what I mean?

so, before it ends up with "bunch of ids", yes there are some joins taking
place and that's the speed concern he was referring to in his article. But
the question was how much do I care about this...

Anyway, my points are all in the comment section. Hopefully someone reply
to it.

In that article, you'll notice how I'm writing queries that depend on
multiple taxonomies, yeah? Well, each taxonomy you add means that the
query to get those posts has another JOIN. One taxonomy in the query =
one JOIN. Two taxonomies in the query = two JOINs. And so forth.

Each taxonomy *in your query* adds a join *to that query*. You can
have a million taxonomies, but if you're only querying against one of
them, then it's only one JOIN.

That's exactly what I had gotten out of that article. Thank you once again
for clarifying.
It's probably very very hard to pass a judgement over whether the 3 joins
crossing media=video audience=beginners featured=must-see is really a big
deal or not! My puzzle is this.

The web site I have to help build has 100K visitors per day, a content
heavy web site with lots of landing pages that paints a magazine/news style
look and feel. now I can implement  their database with 3 taxonomies or
with a single taxonomy ( built in category that is ).  Since taxonomy route
results the   "lots of category titles" - hence the title of this email.
And 3 taxonomies results 3 nice boxes in the admin screen making the data
entry much more enjoyable.

The question is if the speed concerns you raised in your article warrants
that we go with one taxonomy and live with the "lots of category items" or
not.

I run the following function in a standalone php file.

and this comes back with

The php file has the following on top!

3 points.

1. Windows paths need to be written as F:\\inetpath\\ or F:/inetpath/ etc
2. Always include wp-load.php instead of wp-config or wp-blog-header
for stand along scripts
3. wp_insert_category() is an admin function, you must also load the
administrative functions by including wp-admin/admin.php

Dion, for a moment I had gotten excited - until I got stopped by the login
box - which I cannot beat!

current code is as follows now;

<?php

What's wrong here?

I was assuming you were using it as a CLI script and not in-browser.

You should probably avoid admin functions then, instead, use functions
available in wp-includes/category.php and wp-includes/taxonomy.php

Eg: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_insert_term

You got It Dion!

steps that made it work

I removed the admin include.
it's now working only with the include of "wp_load.php"

and secondly, I now use the "wp-insert_term" instead!

Thank you!

Why don't you just try it? Instead of trying to estimate or predict, why
not measure?

Take a copy of your live database/site, and run some tests against it with
the actual queries. You can get them by defining define('SAVEQUERIES',
true); in wp-config and then the queries will be in $wpdb->queries. That
array includes the execution time of those queries. There may be enough of
a difference between them to give you your answer straight away. But those
execution times include some WordPress processing time. So you could
perhaps take those queries and run them directly against your database,
(1000 times and take the average or something).

The most important thing about optimising for speed is to measure.
Measuring will tell you whether you even have a problem that needs
optimising, measuring will tell you how big the problem is, and measuring
(often in the form of profiling) will tell you where the problem is.

It is often not where you think. I once sat through a wonderful
demonstration that showed the difference between two pieces of PHP code
that had the same functionality: one did everything in a couple of
extremely complex multi-part statements, and the other made about 9 or 10
nested function calls to do the same thing. The audience, myself included,
assumed the latter would be slower, we guessed by as much as 10%.

The lecturer demonstrated that after a million iterations the total time
diference between the two methods was still less than 10 milliseconds. Yes
the latter method was slower, but the difference was negligible. The
advantage of the slower method was legibility, maintainability,
debug-ability, etc.

A few years ago, I managed to stop a multisite ecommerce website (not
WordPress!) serving 10,000s of transactions a day, from grinding to a halt
by *reducing* the amount of memory allocated to the engine! No amount of
logic would have got me to that solution, but measurement did. (It turned
out the Java VM had a poorly coded garbage collector, and the more free
memory it had, the worse it performed!)

Measuring, is the only way to be sure.

Excellent advise mike. But the problem is there is no such database. The current db is in mssql and the current site is in asp.  We are migrating 15k records (videos and articlsr and news links etc )from various mssql tables to Wordpress.  The old system got some categorization/classification/taxonomization whatever we want to call it) but one table's classification is not the same as the other one. 

We wanted to put an end to this and bring a law and order. We came up with a simpler classification system where we group items by media type, audience group intended, collection type (tutorials, debates,interviews etc) And topics etc etc. Well the old table's don't  have those but somehow similar classifications. We want to do the migration programmatically.  

The new db may be implemented differently. That's where my original question stemmed from.

So to test/measure, I need to do two migrations right? Which won't happen. I was seeking the community's gut feeling as to how much of a concern is this speed thing all about so I pick the proper taxonomy style. 

If the category boxes had a way to be splitted up from the top levels and appear like sep taxonomies, I would not question this and I would go for one taxonomy=category approach. 

But such an option does not exists as gas as I know.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Wordpress 3.3.1 wp_rewrite bug
Message-ID: <4F7F327D.4070106@gmail.com>

Hey guys,

I just upgraded my wordpress from 2.9.2 to 3.3.1, and some of the 
category pages are broken. Wordpress treats these pages as posts or 
attachments instead. The problem is that some post "post-name" is the 
same as category "slug".

In the parse_request() function, it applies all the rewrite rules to the 
request. When it finds a match, it will use get_page_by_path( $matches[ 
$varmatch[1] ] ) to check if there is a post exists, and stop the rest 
of the process when the condition is true.

Is there any suggestion to fix this problem. I don't want to modify 
wordpress code.

Thanks,

James

What permalink structure are you using on your site? Can you try
disabling all your plugins to see if the problem persists?

Message-ID: <CAHERW=2Rb-tLUz7Mx1S7iBF5FjgKVdr24ZViM7_Z5obnXTwQPg@mail.gmail.com>

I just run this test code ( the sample code right from the codex )

  $labels = array(
    'name' => _x( 'Genres', 'taxonomy general name' ),
    'singular_name' => _x( 'Genre', 'taxonomy singular name' ),
    'search_items' =>  __( 'Search Genres' ),
    'all_items' => __( 'All Genres' ),
    'parent_item' => __( 'Parent Genre' ),
    'parent_item_colon' => __( 'Parent Genre:' ),
    'edit_item' => __( 'Edit Genre' ),
    'update_item' => __( 'Update Genre' ),
    'add_new_item' => __( 'Add New Genre' ),
    'new_item_name' => __( 'New Genre Name' ),
    'menu_name' => __( 'Genre' ),
  );

  register_taxonomy('genre',array('book'), array(
    'hierarchical' => true,
    'labels' => $labels,
    'show_ui' => true,
    'query_var' => true,
    'rewrite' => array( 'slug' => 'genre' ),
  ));


and then I run this

$taxonomies=get_taxonomies('','names');
foreach ($taxonomies as $taxonomy ) {
  echo '<p>'. $taxonomy. '</p>';
}


And as result, expectedly, I get to see the newly created custom taxonomy
"genre" reported along with the other ones such as link_category,
post_format and so on.

But I am unable to spot any trace of it whatsoever in any of the wordpress
tables! The word genre does not exist.

Where does the newly created custom taxonomy data get stored?

Mind due that there are no terms associated under it yet.

It's registered, it will only get stored as soon as you include some term
in that taxonomy.

but registered where? in a text file?

I run the code in a stand alone php page, not in some theme's
functions.php.

the exact page goes like this,

when you say registered? I'm curious to know where it is registered,
memory?

  ));

  echo "<p>Done!";

$taxonomies=get_taxonomies('','names');
foreach ($taxonomies as $taxonomy ) {
  echo '<p>'. $taxonomy. '</p>';
}

If you want to use a custom taxonomy, you need to put your code in a
plugin.  Taxonomies are all registered at run time.  Take a look at how
core registeres categories and tags (
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/taxonomy.php#L21).

register_taxonomy must be called on every page load, the data is
"registered" for the current page load only, and must be called before
anything that needs to use it. The best place is a hook attached to
'init' usually.

The only data which is stored in the database is the actual Terms,
which are stored in the 'terms' table. The relationship between a
Term->Post object is stored in the 'term_relationships' table, and the
relationship linking a term to it's taxonomy is in the 'term_taxonomy'
table - Only the slug of the Taxonomy is stored in the database, in
your case, it would be 'genre' or 'writer' but they'll only be there
if you insert a Term that's actually in that taxonomy, the code you're
using inserts a category only.

See http://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description#Table:_wp_terms onwards

That's just default (read: portable) behavior. I am pretty sure the plugin
allows you to store files outside the web root and/or you can just deny
access to wp-content/uploads/documents and then let the plugin serve the
individual documents through its bootstrap.

Eek. That query is insecure and not "prepared".

prepare() does not take ARRAY_A, get_row() does. What you want is to use %s
or %d in a query string, then pass prepare additional arguments for those
placeholders. It's like sprintf().

prepare() is not magic.

So:

$query = "select * from sometable where id = %d";
$wpdb->get_row( $wpdb->prepare( $query, $id ), ARRAY_A ) );

I know I've seen plenty of hook lists in the wild before but I don't
think I've ever seen documentation as to when each of them fires. I'm
interested in figuring out

1) the first hook that produces actual output
2) the last hook that fires in the head
3) the last hook that fires before end-of-rendering

I want to hook into some hooks and output some diagnostic info, but I
don't want to print anything on any hooks that might fire before the
DOCTYPE or after the closing HTML.

Any ideas out there?

The first thing that outputs any markup is actually the theme (or, it
should be). The 'template_redirect' hook is the closest one to before
the theme files are loaded, but it still fires before anything output
by the theme. If you want to output something after the DOCTYPE then
it can only reliably be 'wp_head', which fires within the head.

> 2) the last hook that fires in the head

Also 'wp_head', as there's only one hook in the head.

> 3) the last hook that fires before end-of-rendering

'wp_footer' if you want to remain within the <html> element, or
'shutdown' which is the last hook to fire after everything is done and
dusted.

>>register_taxonomy must be called on every page load, the data is
"registered" for the current page load only, and must be called before
anything that needs to use it. The best place is a hook attached to
'init' usually.

I'm not going to question what the wisdom behind that approach is, though I
found it difficult to understand why such a fundamental piece of
information is not kept in the database? and it is kept in the server
memory?

I'm just trying to understand the process. Please verify the following
understanding is correct.

Suppose there are two plugins whose sole jobs are to create custom
taxonomies.
And I happened to install and activate both of them. ( sidenote: It does
not matter which particular plugins they are - because, I don't have them
to begin with and it's irrelevant to the question I have. Just imagine two
top two custom taxonomy creation plugs in. )

Say, I create a taxonomy called "Audience" - using one of those plugins.
And I pass the description of the Audiance taxonomy as "Description XYZ"
using that plugins UI.
Then I adjust my template file to output the description of the Audience
taxonomy. My site visitors should be able to see "Description XYZ". Right?

Then I go ahead and open up the second plug ins UI.

Question 1: Will I be able to see the audience taxonomy that the first plug
in created?

Question 2: If I am able to see the audience taxonomy that the first plugin
has created && I am able to modify the description from "Description XYZ"
to "Description ABC" (using the second plugins UI), would I be able to
effect the wordpress page that my visitors see so that my visitors now read
 the "Description ABC" as opposed to the original "Description XYZ"? Or
does this depend on which plugin is active at the moment? What if they both
are active? If I happened to remove those two plugins, would all my
taxonomy-term associations with my posts will be gone and my site
functionality totally suffer from it?

How do I make sure that once I create taxonomy and start using it, it
always stays there.
With the limited knowledge I have, I'm guessing either stick to one plug in
and keep it active all the time, or write your own global_functions.php
file and make sure all my template's functions.php files have an include
reference to it and keep my register_taxonomy functions in
the global_functions.php?




>> The only data which is stored in the database is the actual Terms,
which are stored in the 'terms' table. The relationship between a
Term->Post object is stored in the 'term_relationships' table, and the
relationship linking a term to it's taxonomy is in the 'term_taxonomy'
table - Only the slug of the Taxonomy is stored in the database, in
your case, it would be 'genre' or 'writer' but they'll only be there
if you insert a Term that's actually in that taxonomy, the code you're
using inserts a category only.

Thank you Dion as always you clarify it very well. If I no longer have the
register_taxonomy function running ( when wordpress loads or inits ), can
the posts still be pulled by that taxonomy & term?

Message-ID: <CAHERW=2jUJRReYXia7gR+vqDhdW64R+UN2oYeWYEQh0sCLbNgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Working with a tag system ( a non-hierarchical taxonomy that is ), I plan
on tagging items like this

Basketball
Michael Jordan
Soccer
Babe Ruth
Muhammad Ali
Jim Brown
Jesse Owens
Joe Louis
Boxing
Sonny Liston
Ronaldinho
Baseball


The point here I'm trying to draw attention to is that some terms in this
list sound like "groups or categories", and some sound like individuals,
persons. Some terms you can find in word dictionaries ( soccer, basketball
etc ) , and some you cannot ( jordan, owens and so on).

Sure, I can take the items that "sound like" groups /or categories from
this tag group and implement them as another custom taxonomy or categories
for that matter. But that's not the point.
In many times in real life, we find that tag clouds contains many mixed
items - exactly like the list above, that is some items sound like
groups/or cats and some don't. and many site serve their visitors like that
and it is certainly not the end of the world. The question is can we do
better with a little trick.

Is the following possible?

Still use the same single taxonomy, but have your content developers tag
the items the following way instead;

-Basketball
Michael Jordan
-Soccer
Babe Ruth
Muhammad Ali
Jim Brown
Jesse Owens
Joe Louis
-Boxing
Sonny Liston
Ronaldinho
-Baseball

Notice that the cat sounding ones are prefixed with a - . Easy enough.
Yeah?

The convenience here is that when tagging the item, my guys still type in
the same box ( that is one place to go for tagging cause there is only one
taxonomy involved )  and they just press the "-" key and boom, the tag
interface displays them with a ajax'ed summary of all the cat sounding
names, and they just pick one, or simply create a new one like such as
"-tennis".

While they are at it, they can go ahead and type the
individual athlete names too... it's like two bird with one stone.

The question is how far does this creative or ( not so creative idea )
live?

My initial questions are...

What happens to the urls ( and slugs ) for those tags that are prefixed
with a "-"?

And what happens to the tag searches? Will my users be able to find Soccer
players by simply typing "soccer" into the search tags box that I provide
for them or is it that they are going to have to type in "-soccer" instead?

Basically you are just looking to create a hierarchical taxonomy with an interface that is non-heirarchical. Or is it more a tax of a tax.

Check the plugin Debug Objects, can help you.
List All hooks and his location in core, also the functions and many more.
Maybe it's the right solution for you.

I am simply exploring the idea of getting more mileage out of using the
tags ( which is non-hierarchial in nature ).

When I display my tag list for that custom taxonomy for my users, instead
of displaying the huge list in a mixed form, I am trying to achieve the
ability to groupe them.
And for that, I'm thinking of using the simple prefix "-".

With that in mind, I should be able to display the same tag list as follows;


 Baseball
 Basketball
 Boxing
 Soccer
-----------------------------------
 Michael Jordan
 Babe Ruth
 Muhammad Ali
 Jim Brown
 Jesse Owens
 Joe Louis
 Sonny Liston
 Ronaldinho

Isn't it a useful UI for my users and pretty much effortless to achieve?

But again, back to the original question;

What happens to the urls ( and slugs ) for those tags that are
prefixed with a "-"?

And what happens to the tag searches? Will my users be able to find
Soccer players by simply typing "soccer" into the search tags box that I
provide for them or is it that they are going to have to type in "-soccer"
instead?

Don't use an ambiguous custom permalink structure. Avoid starting your
custom permalinks with non-numerics. Put the %year% in front or
something.

why not set up a quick test site to find out? it'll only take 5 minutes.

personally, i wouldn't go for adding hyphens or any other kind of
meaningless symbol to your terms as it will only serve to confuse your
users & visitors and increase the chances of human error.

it also seems very clear to me that you are trying to squeeze two different
types of data into one taxonomy (sports and sportspeople), where using two
taxonomies would be much more semantically correct, easier for your users
to understand and less prone to problems.

Message-ID: <CAF_6N0PoE2Zuf20Tk7h5BBxUhtiwd5Xt1=Mz+wsQ3jCO-+3-sA@mail.gmail.com>

Im trying to create a custom "custom" meta box, I want to create a metabox
that acts like a table. For this I need to modify some basic structure.

See this image please as an example: http://i.imgur.com/N9pye.jpg (Im
trying to move the table's TH to the Title of the Metabox)

Currently im creating a custom meta box and then inserting an HTML table
inside. What I really want is to modify this metabox to be more "table
like/friendly".

Is there a way to do that?

Thanks in advance!

Taxonomies, Post Statuses, and Custom Post Types are not the type of
data that needs persistent storage, in most cases, in order to make
either of these functionalities useful, extra code is required (a more
custom meta box, theme display, hooks to control the way the data is
saved (pre-processing), etc) to control the way the item acts, combine
that with the translation data needed, and you suddenly don't actually
have any data that should be stored persistently.
Remember, that the register_*() calls can go into a themes
functions.php file too.
Having it in code also leads to portability, you can move a theme, or
a plugin to another site, and any custom items it requires will be
active there as well, rather than the user having to run a secondary
install process.

Chances are, 2 plugins whose sole purpose in life is to create a UI to
add a custom taxonomy will be incompatible with eachother, However not
in the way you probably expect.
The incompatibility will be in the data storage, If 2 plugins were
running, they'd both be able to register/edit the taxonomies they know
about (Ie. those that were created in it).
the plugins who create a UI to create taxonomies/post types are not
designed to be used as -the- way of creating a tax/cpt, their purpose
in life is to make it faster to create an example if anything, most of
the ones I have seen (well the popular ones at least) also provide the
PHP code which you should add to your site once you've finished
checking the checkboxes/etc.

You'll need to do one of 3 things:
 * Create a plugin for your site, and put your site-specific code in
there (or code you want to include on all your sites)
 * If the code is theme-specific, put it in your themes functions.php
- If you're using a ready-made theme, consider making a Child Theme of
it - http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes
 * Create a mu-plugin, mu-plugins are commonly called 'Must Use
Plugins' they're loaded always, but act the same as normal plugins,
simply drop a .php file into wp-content/mu-plugins and it'll be loaded
automatically.

If you don't have a register_taxonomy() call, then WordPress will not
know about the taxonomy, and as a result, won't be able to query for
it.
It comes from 2 reasons, It no longer knows what the query variable
for it is (in the URL), and it no longer knows if it should be
publicly accessible (You can create taxonomies which should never be
accessed from the front end, and are simply there to control a theme
or plugin).
I also missed a question earlier, Data is NOT deleted if you don't
have the register_Taxonomy() call, the term data, and all relationship
data remains in the database, it just won't be accessed again until
the register_taxonomy() call is made again, this is also why you
should call it on the init hook, that way it's available to all
plugins/theme functions which run after it.

Not sure if this is possible, but it seems such a simple thing to implement so I may be missing the point.

In the same way you can use bloginfo() or get_stylesheet_directory_uri() to specify a direct path is there a way to define an external URL so it can be included in the same way?

As a general example, I want to pull an image from a CDN.

To grab the image in the 'normal' theme folder you could simply write:
<img src="<?php get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); ?>/images/image.png">

but using the CDN I will have to use something like:
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKETNAME/images/image.png">

What would be super extra spiffy is if I could use something like:
<img src="<?php get_cdn_uri(); ?>/images/image.png">

Possible? Newbie question? Completely off my rocker?

Cheers,

Lee

If I use the truncate on the tables I was to clear, it truncates it all the
way. It does not take me back to the fresh install. For example, doing
truncate on the "wp_term_taxonomy" table will get rid of the 2 taxonomies (
category + link_category) that comes with fresh install.

A more ideal solution is to backup from an exported xml file.

Something like this;

<?php
restore_from_backup($full_path_to_xml_file);
?>

Does anyone know how to make that happen?

Daniel earlier mentioned that

mysql -u #username#  -p #database# < #dump_file#

would restore the database.

But how do I do this from a PHP code?

Subject: [wp-hackers] term_taxonomy_id = term_id. Always?
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2EK7yrZFjyuaTucP-HZsSMNQQP+MhE9gGXngHbG2SdKQ@mail.gmail.com>

I've been trying to understand the how the tables are related by adding new
tags, cats, sub cats to a fresh install and examine what's happening behind
the scenes through phpmyadmin.

I've observed that for the early records... the two id's in the
wp_term_taxonomy  ( which are term_taxonomy_id & term_id ) always go hand
in hand. Whatever the value is for one is the value for the other. When
does these guys break apart?

That's my first question.

So far, I've observed the following rules

Unless you add a new term ( that is adding a new category or tag or add new
link into the system ), the following two tables won't get changed.

wp_terms
wp_tem_taxonomy

Another way to say the above sentence,

wp_terms
wp_tem_taxonomy

gets changed only when you add a new term.

As you associate tags/categories with posts, and links with
link_categories, you cause a change in the following table

wp_term_relationships

there are two important fields in this table, the object_id and
term_taxonomy_id,
I dunno what the heck term_order is used for here - yet.
 When I see the object_id "1" in there, I mistakingly thought that the
object_id values stored in that table refer to the ID field values of the
wp_posts.  No. It could be either "id=1 of wp_posts" or the "link_id=1 of
wp_links".
 Also, in the wp_term_relationships table, I see some other records which
happen to be related to the term_taxonomy_id 2.
 I thought that that "2" here refers to the term_taxonomy_id=2 of the
"wp_term_taxonomy" table which in turn means the taxonomy  "link_category".
But up until now, I'm not sure if that "2" is the term_id of the wp_terms
which in turn means the term "blogroll".

Please clarify.

Message-ID: <CAHERW=1ySRzoP8qAs9xxT-EeaNRi0pTjpHrNkM1S2Q3DcHT7Zg@mail.gmail.com>

Doesn't wordpress importer ( 0.6 )  import the links?

I've been trying for the second time, that the exported wordpress does not
contain any of the original 7 links that comes with the frsh install.

My test environment is as follows.

get a fresh install.
make an xml backup ( export ) of it as backup.xml

add a few links, posts, tags, taxonomies....

then run

TRUNCATE TABLE wp_links
TRUNCATE TABLE wp_posts
TRUNCATE TABLE wp_terms
TRUNCATE TABLE wp_term_taxonomy
TRUNCATE TABLE wp_term_relationships

this literally clears the mentioned 5 tables.

then run the wordpress importer plugin and point to backup.xml

As a result, I get the hello world, the uncategorized category and that's
about it,.


I check out the wp_terms, wp_term_taxonomy, wp_term_relationships tables.
NADA. 0 records in there.

I check out the wp_posts and I get 3 records in there, with ID's 1,3 and 4.

It's totally misbehaving. Isn't a wordpress exported xml file with 0
resourced attached to it be easily imported back with wordpress importer
identically?

After truncating the wp_posts table, how come do I end up getting the id 2
is missing after the import? It beats me.

Basically the term is the basic item and let's call the term Foo (term 1)

Term Taxonomy ID defines the taxonomy or taxonomies that foo is associated with. Then term taxonomy ID could be 1 for foo the category, 2 for foo the tag, 3 for foo the link category. In all these cases there is only one term still foo.

Then in term relationship it associates the term taxonomy is to an item. Because Tags and Categories are associated with a post Post type then the number becomes obviously the post ID. For link categories the link ID, or in theory it could be used to relate to anything that has a number ID. (User ID or some ID from your own table of data.) Term Order is used for special custom sorting situations.

Well, I started out with a fresh install

Then I added category. I called it termX.
Then I added a child to that category. I called the child termX too!
and finally I created a tag. And I called that too termX.

then I visited the wp_terms table, this is what I get

First of all, I was expecting to get a single termX. I'm even more confused
now.


But, anyway, let me go on...

Then I checked wp_term_taxonomy

Intrestingly, in this table, the term_taxonomy_id and the term_id from 1
all the way to 5 carry the same same ID's. I'm still unable to understand
why do I always get these two ID values the same and what does it take to
cause them to be different? This was actually my originial question.

And finally, in the following table;

the term_taxonomy_id value "2" here...

does it refer to the term_id "2" of the wp_terms table - the  "blogroll"
term?

or

does it refer to the term_taxonomy_id "2" of the wp_term_taxonomy table -
the "link_category" taxonomy?

both ID's being 2 makes it difficult to decipher it.

Why on earth it's called an import utility and does not the job they way it
is expected to do?
To least, I thought it will either not work at all, or it will truly bring
the database structure to "exactly" to the state that when .xml generated.

And any idea of where the wp-post's ID 2 go?

Does mySQL's "TRUNCATE" also has its own weird logic that sometimes after
the truncate, you cannot really, truly start from a fresh slate and your
previous database structure will somehow haunt again?

Links aren't posts, and while I happen to agree with you, you'll note they're in their own table. The export tool is pretty clear on saying it exports posts, pages, comments, custom fields, categories and tags. It never says links. So ... Yeah, I agree it's frustrating, but it's a bit of the old RTFM.

As for why you don't get the page... I have no idea. Are you SURE you're exporting everything and not just posts? There are options for All, Posts, Pages, and your CPTs.

This is one of the great disconnects with WP.Links, in its current state, are hardly used anywhere as they work in a simple 1-1 format that no other CMS uses.
Haluk, if you think of WP as a purely blogging-focussed tool (and it pretty much was when the importer was built), then this all makes sense.
If you're thinking of using WP as a CMS, in which you're attempting to move a "development"/beta environment data to a live release, then WP import is absolutely not the way to go. Sadly, with the hardcoding of the URL (and multiple dependancies) in multiple places in database and content; the "pushing" of content from one WP install to another on a different domain is far from easy, but it's not too complex either (just don't think you can search/replace either thats a recipe for a disaster).

this php script makes search & replace within your database very
straightforward (even within serialised arrays):
http://interconnectit.com/124/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/

assuming you wish to make an exact copy of your entire site (including
options, users, etc) but just change the domain name, this is a very easy
way to do that.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Register_Taxonomy, when is it needed?
Message-ID: <CAHERW=09vdS1NBAp6rp9PkFPD8RyFFq55tqS0a=GyLGUy-MRxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Another  WordPress-guts question..

Say, I am putting the records into the "wp_terms" and into the
"wp_term_taxonomy" tables *programmatically*.

example

I add a term in the "wp_terms" table called "audience" - (which turns out
to be with as termID = 100 )
and then I add 2 more terms into the same table ( wp_terms ) and these
terms are called "women" and "youth".  And as a result, I get termIDs 101
and 102, respectively.

then I goto the "wp_term_taxonomy" table, and add 2 records into it so that
I end up assigning the terms "youth" and "women" with the intent of they
are terms under the taxonomy called "audience".

But first I have to add this record
term_taxonomy_id____term_id____taxonomy
100_______________100_______audience

My understanding is that the above entry means that there is a term with
the id "100" ( which maps to the label "audience" ) and its associated with
the "audience" taxonomy. I hope this understanding is correct.

To add the two records that would associate the "women" and "youth" terms
under the taxonomy "audience", I do this;

term_taxonomy_id____term_id____taxonomy
101_______________101_______audience
102_______________102_______audience

You will not be able to use any of the taxonomy functions, such as
get_terms() or do taxonomy queries using WP_Query.

And why wasn't WordPress code & db structure implemented in a way so that

We could store all those options as a serialized array in the wp_options
table, but there's really no point, since we don't have any UI for
registering taxonomies from wp-admin.

Thank you  Kevinjohn Gallagher.  I ask my questions to understand and learn
from you all. This is where one of the best minds of the planet hang out as
far as WP goes, right? I cannot think of a better venue than this.

At the end, No. I won't be using the import tool at all. But I would be
putting 15000+ records from multiple microsoft SQL tables into WP
programmatically.

The process will include creating the taxonomies, 1000's of terms under
various taxonomies, and associating existing article's content with
term_taxonomy_id's of the programmatically created terms and assigning
anonymous comments to the posts -- all that programmatically.

So, where and why do I need the importer?

Well, while I do this process, I assume that I will be doing lots of trials
and errors.
I need to go back to a fresh slate many times.
I was trying to simplify the steps so that I don't end up logging into
godaddy, drop the database, wait for the database removal pending, then
install the same named mysql database, wait for the pending set up, wait
for the wordpress to wake up and give me famous 5 min install and all that.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin Authors: Major Plugin Upgrade Question
Message-ID: <39dab3d3-4087-41b7-9856-f6c6eaf5f78e@h4g2000yqj.googlegroups.com>

I've got a pretty beefy question for plugin authors. I'm getting ready
to release a major new version of one of my plugins, but really don't
know how to handle the upgrade as I've never attempted anything of
this scale for any of my plugins in the past.

There's a lot of DB changes, a big codebase change (refactor), etc..

Do I submit a new plugin to WP.org, update my old plugin readme.txt to
tell users to check out the new version, that way they can install/
activate and run the upgrade script that is required? (has to be run
by hand, as the upgrade could potentially fail if just run
automatically for really really large sites using this plugin (server
config issues like timeouts etc)

Or how should I handle the upgrade? Do I try to figure out some
complex workaround to keep sites functional up until the upgrade
script is run (once they've upgraded to the new major version)?

Also -- if I do the plugin release in-place (like a normal plugin
update would be), how do I communicate to users that an upgrade script
needs to be run, to backup their DBs before upgrading in WP itself
(the plugin updater), etc..? How do I handle this for future 2.x
releases, for users who didn't have time to update to 2.0? Do I keep
that text in the upgrade notices forever?

Any tips are appreciated, I want to be sure I'm thinking about all my
options and so far it seems like I must be overlooking something.
Users are #1 here, so I don't want to do anything that would disrupt
their site.

Hi Scott,
   You can check WordPress Plugin Kickstarter (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-plugin-kickstarter/). It has
an idea how to handle plugin upgrade process.
    Create a simple plugin with Kickstarter and check main file.

  Regards,
  Vasyl

Are you saying that there are no benefits of having a table called
something like "wp_taxonomy" where all the "taxonomy" information such
as taxonomy_id , taxonomy_name, hierarchial or not, rewrite stuff and even
the "taxonomy_description" and so on? I don't get it.

And what do you mean by " we don't have any UI for registering taxonomies
from wp-admin. "

I've gone through this same issue with some of my own systems - the 1.x
data system was different enough from the 2.x system that they were
incompatible.

Ideally, you would include some kind of auto-update script with the plugin.
 Perhaps export your data to a flatfile and then reimport it (so you could
resume if something times out in the process).  But if there is a lot of
manual intervention required, I would recommend creating a new plugin and
referring people to it.

Just know that if you do create a new plugin ... existing users will never
see an update notice.  Most people skip reading the readme anyway, so
you're likely to lose customers in the transition.

Is this an update to Pods by any chance?

What sort of DB changes are being made? Can the operations to perform
the DB changes be chunked? In an ideal world, the new version of the
plugin would continue to support the old database schema. This would
allow the new version to be installed but without the need to run the
DB schema upgrade immediately. Not necessarily the easiest option, but
the most user-friendly.

The plugin would then display a notice on every admin screen stating
that an upgrade routine needs to be performed. An admin screen which
uses AJAX would fire off incremental updates to your DB structure,
providing feedback as it goes. The WordPress Multisite upgrade screen
does this, as do several plugins such as Viper007Bond's Regenerate
Thumbnails [1].

Since this has been touched upon several times recently, I want to 
mention that truncating a table does not restore it back to its original 
state.

The auto increment field in each of the tables is still going to be at 
the next number to be generated.  If you want to empty and reset 
WordPress's tables, try something like this..

truncate table wp_terms;
truncate table wp_term_taxonomy;
truncate table wp_term_relationships;
truncate table wp_commentmeta;
truncate table wp_comments;
truncate table wp_links;
truncate table wp_options;
truncate table wp_postmeta;
truncate table wp_posts;
truncate table wp_users;
truncate table wp_usermeta;
alter table wp_terms auto_increment = 1;
alter table wp_term_taxonomy auto_increment = 1;
alter table wp_commentmeta auto_increment = 1;
alter table wp_comments auto_increment = 1;
alter table wp_links auto_increment = 1;
alter table wp_options auto_increment = 1;
alter table wp_postmeta auto_increment = 1;
alter table wp_posts auto_increment = 1;
alter table wp_users auto_increment = 1;
alter table wp_usermeta auto_increment = 1;

Alter to fit your needs.  And yes wp_term_relationships doesn't have an 
auto_increment field. It's not a copy/paste mistake.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Terms Meta / Best way to implement
Message-ID: <4F833A1B.9070704@gmail.com>

Hello,

Interested in what people feel is the best way to implement a certain 
data/post set.

I have a custom post type, let's call them Businesses, that are all 
categorised into Location.

Now - if Location was 'simple', eg just name, I'd create it as Taxonomy, 
and assign the relevant location in each Business custom post. However 
each Location will have it's own page with lots of additional 
information, including featured image, description, co-ordinates etc ... 
which almost makes me thing this should be "another" custom post type.

However that then brings the question of how to assign Businesses to 
Locations ...

I'd imagine a URL structure similar to:
/london
/london/business-name

With no Taxonomy Meta in core, how are people tackling this?

Do you suggest I implement Taxonomy Meta or use another Custom Post Type 
and some clever assigning?

Thanks,
Rob

If you did wish to import links into a WordPress installation, then there
is a link importer. If you go to tools -> import, and click on the Blogroll
importer (you may need to install and activate it first), it will import an
OPML list of links (a standard link export format).

If you need to import with categories, there is a plugin for that.

Sounds like a prime candidate for using the Posts 2 Posts plugin:

Why wouldn't truncate reset the auto_increment values?

It's not 100% certain that they will but assuming he runs MySQL > 5.0.13
(which i think is a pretty fair assumption) they will be reset AFAIK.

My own tests say they do, the resources i find say they do and the MySQL
documentation for truncate
table<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/truncate-table.html> says
they do.

What am I missing?

Ah, yes you've said it yourself, the answer is found in the details on 
that page:
"From MySQL 5.0.13 on, the AUTO_INCREMENT counter is reset to zero by 
TRUNCATE TABLE"

Other document states:
"(Some older versions may not reset the AUTO_INCREMENT value. In this 
case, you can use ALTER TABLE tbl_name AUTO_INCREMENT=1 after the 
TRUNCATE TABLE statement.)"

I hadn't realized this had changed & always kept doing the reset anytime 
I truncate.   Thanks for the followup.

It's one less thing to remember!

Also, to export the links from a WordPress blog, visit the

Subject: [wp-hackers] a few observations at the wp_install_defaults
Message-ID: <CAHERW=0fLK9baC_05CCgVA8RPa+5sZSkQkfZMNZQLOs2-N8XYA@mail.gmail.com>

Could be a trivial points that do not help much to anybody else, but it
piqued my curiosity that wp_install_defaults function has the following 3
matters

----------------------------
matter 1
----------------------------
does not use wp-insert_term. instead, it uses wpdb->insert style.



----------------------------
matter 2
----------------------------
though, wp_terms mysq table's ID field is set up to be auto-incrementing
from the get-go, yet, wp_install_defaults prefers to set the cat_id to 1 (
for the first cat term added that is "uncategorized ). A similar situation
occurs where "blogroll_id is hard coded in code to be as 2 before it is
used in its related wpdb->insert call.

example:

    ....
$cat_id = 1;
}

$wpdb->insert( $wpdb->terms, array('term_id' => $cat_id, 'name' =>
$cat_name, 'slug' => $cat_slug, 'term_group' => 0) );
$wpdb->insert( $wpdb->term_taxonomy, array('term_id' => $cat_id, 'taxonomy'
=> 'category', 'description' => '', 'parent' => 0, 'count' => 1));
$cat_tt_id = $wpdb->insert_id;

// Default link category
$cat_name = __('Blogroll');
/* translators: Default link category slug */
$cat_slug = sanitize_title(_x('Blogroll', 'Default link category slug'));

if ( global_terms_enabled() ) {
//not my problem.
} else {
$blogroll_id = 2;
}

$wpdb->insert( $wpdb->terms, array('term_id' => $blogroll_id, 'name' =>
$cat_name, 'slug' => $cat_slug, 'term_group' => 0) );
$wpdb->insert( $wpdb->term_taxonomy, array('term_id' => $blogroll_id,
'taxonomy' => 'link_category', 'description' => '', 'parent' => 0, 'count'
=> 7));
$blogroll_tt_id = $wpdb->insert_id;


----------------------------
matter 3
----------------------------

for the "first post", the guid is prepared to be as follows;

$first_post_guid = get_option('home') . '/?p=1';

Now, when I add posts programmatically, what am I going to with this guid
field? Do I randomly come up with id's? I would be using permalinks at the
end of the day, so that does this guid field p= value matter at all? can I
just keep it as blank?

Hi there,

sorry to bug you guys here but I couldn't find any other way of solving
this.
It seems I am bozoed and AKISMEt is marking my posts on the
wordpress.orgforums as SPAM so nobody sees my replies except for the
people who have
subscribed to email updates to the topics I am posting in...

Besides, since this problem occurred, I am having more and more trouble
commenting on other sites too, it seems AKISMET, globally, has a problem
with my email address or my name?

Thanks for looking into this.
Ovidiu

http://wordpress.org/support/profile/ovidiu is you?

You're being caught by the moderation queue, which must be MANUALLY cleaned on. We do get to this eventually, but some days we're slower than others, however you are NOT flagged by Akismet that I can see from the forum end. So if think you are, go to Akismet.com and report it there.

The forum mods will sort out the spam queue. It may take some time, so please just calm down and trust we will get to it.

Jepp, that is my profile.

I'm not panicking but this situation has persisted for at least a week and
the end user, that is me, doesn't get any warning. So of course I'm in a
bit of a rush to get out of the moderation queue since I don't know for
sure how long I have been moderated.

If another user didn't tell me that he doesn't see my replies in the forums
but gets my posts by email because he subscribed to the thread I'd have
never figured out I was being moderated.

Thanks for the reply.
Ovidiu

A variety of things can flip the moderation bit. Manually it happens if you tick people off ;) I took the liberty of a search and found that this happens to you, in particular, about every 6-8 months, so I could only speculate that your .ru email, which is sadly abused by your countrymen, is at fault. The other common cause is when you post too much too fast, or a LOT of code.

You don't have to alert the mods, though, or even email anyone. We really do go through this when we see someone being caught and we really will fix it. (The last couple times, you emailed the forums list directly, so I don't know why you forgot this in the intervening time, or that this has happened to you before, and as we told you the last three times, we will, and DO, fix it. So ... Y'know, it's not a big deal. Happens to everyone.)

*Manually it happens if you tick people off* - *lol*

Apart from that, it does happen to me about once a year, that's right but I
am not Russian, wrong assumption.

I do understand that you go through the moderation queue and if I knew I
was in the moderation queue, I wouldn't have alerted anyone.
But how would I know I am in the moderation queue? All this hassle could
have been solved by showing me a hint after posting that my post was being
moderated. That way, I'd have known what was happening.

As to the last 3 times me mailing the right mailing list: I had a hard time
remembering the proper mailing list. Hacker sounded like some very
important people hang around it and I was right: you're here to save me :-)

I promise I won't bug your hackers list anymore. Actually I'll unsubscribe
right now.
And since you insisted on mentioning that this happened to me before, I dug
around and the last mail I found says:

It's an installation process. It's not "inserting terms", it's
inserting rows into the database tables.

Yes, because those are the first terms added to the table, so their
state is a known starting state. It really doesn't matter whether
they're set by an auto-increment process or not, however because the
state of the table is known and the IDs are assuming in other places
by other rows, they need to be set precisely instead of having an
assumption made about the starting state of the auto_increment field.

The GUID field is added programmatically. You don't set it at all if
you use wp_insert_post and the like. However, choosing a random ID
would be incorrect, the ID is the ID of the post. Ideally, you
wouldn't ever choose this in the first place.


The installation process is setting the database to a known initial
state. It's setting up things to be correct. It bypasses some of the
normal automatic processes to do this. This is not unusual, since the
state of a blank WP database is known in advance.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Problem with ajax filter and pagination
Message-ID: <CAL1O-KUf2yFen6+JYRBp8nBNSwa8uzt7YOwwx8yGbc1ko_QGtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Personally, I'm thinking in logic to resolve an issue here and would like
your help.

I have a post called type wines in our archive-vinho.php I have a menu
where the visitor can select custom fields and taxonomies of the post type
wine and then click filter to filter the wine you want listed.

I have a page in WordPress called filter-vinho.php page when the user makes
a filter I call this page via ajax, and load into a DIV-vinho.php archive
page. The problem is paging ...

When the user makes a filter page with the results of this filter is loaded
via ajax paging up and comes correct, but when you click one of the pages
he loses the back of the filter parameters to take into account all the
wines, not just the result filter.

I think my logic have created another page to display the resulatdo filter
is wrong, but I could not think of another way to load this content via
ajax without creating a new page, can you help me?

Message-ID: <CAHERW=39oMAwb8HMq49PVketcoPsO0Ceyc+USS4eHeZ5D8rL-A@mail.gmail.com>

I got 55K links to various news sources ( I should say to various external
articles ) accumulated over the years in the home grown CMS that I'm
working with.

I can bring them into WP as links, giving each a link_ID and so on.
But when a user clicks on one of those links, that click won't give any
benefit to the site owner - I'm talking about in terms of a page
impression, nit in terms of SEO or anything else.  The fact is that the
user immediately leaves his site.

It would have been better if the destination article was featured in a
summary paragraph or so locally and the [more] link at the end of the
summary would direct the user to the final ( external ) destination. This
approach gets the site owner a bunch of banner expressions, more page views
etc.

Of course, one could achieve this goal by importing the links into wp_posts
and handle them as posts... But that means, I bloat the wp_posts with 55K
records at a heart beat. Considering those 55K links are really not that
important in the grand scheme compared to the 15K posts that the site owner
has created, I'm wondering how efficient or smart this approach be. His
more important stuff takes only 15000 records. But with the links he got,
now he has 70000 records. That's a terrible execution of a 80/20 rule.

Wouldn't it have been nice to keep those 55K links STILL in the wp_links
table, treat them as such but have a field in the wp_links table called
link_excerpt_summary (or something like that )and a slug for the link to
have its own local URL so that clicking on such a link will first bring the
user to the local url?

This way, we won't be bloating the wp_posts table, links are still
treated/classified as links,  but yet the site owner can get a page view
out them.

I know that such ideas won't make it to the core. What I wondering though,
how would you go about this implementation with the current wordpress
functionality?

Subject: [wp-hackers] is there a plug in that does browser's text view
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2iOGF9-TH0ZAfwwk6scZZ8+roj9p5xFuRmBqR8Vm99Tw@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a plug in ( or a php snippet you know of ) that extracts the text
( filtering down the HTML ) out of a url passed to it?

Example:

Check this link out
http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/04/2012410203742758407.html

In its page body, it's got the following text;

"Kofi Annan has urged the UN Security Council to help prevent the collapse
of his efforts ..... "

Which is the same text that you see when you google that article
https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=UN+urged+to+push+for+Syria+ceasefire

The plan is that I write a script, that submits to google, gets into google
html, parses the 1st link and gets that 55 word description out of it and
then uses that extraction as a beginning delimiter in getting the 500
characters from the destination article.  I need that plug in and PHP code
so that I can work with a cleaner/easier  text to deal with.

Ofcourse, I can get into the PHP's striptags function and create that
snippet myself (but before I get my hands dirty with coding), I thought I
double check with you guys.. maybe you guys know of a plug in - or suggest
a better way.  I thought of getting to the RSS text but I cannot find an
RSS content search using google.

Otto,

When adding posts programmatically, is there any advantage of using
wpdb->insert over the wp-insert_post?
And the same question goes for inserting links or comments. Do you guys
suggest to use wp_insert_link and wo_insert_comments? Are there any con's
that I should be aware of?

The GUID field is added programmatically. You don't set it at all if
you use wp_insert_post and the like. However, choosing a random ID
would be incorrect, the ID is the ID of the post. Ideally, you
wouldn't ever choose this in the first place.

Doesn't the built in facilities for links have a description field you
can use as the link excerpt summary? why wouldn't you use this and
display them in a custom view?

I thought about that. It also has much larger field link_note. I don't have
a problem much with where to store the description / excerpt. Currently,
you click on the link, you are out, heading towards the other web site.
Links do not have a local url - cause they do not have a slug to begin
with.

I'm trying to get an extra click/page impression. Any ideas for that?

Ah... well, maybe rewrite all links to a permalink structure like
.../out/... from where you link them out for good?  And then you have
to display our content on that link... like

../out/wwwmyawesomelinkcom/ and the linnk out would be contained within.

Maybe custom post types would help?

Here is my solution to this

Use the wp_links" table's "link_notes" field to store the excerpt of the
linked article.

Do NOT use the "link_url" for storing the "external link url".
Instead store the following URL; ( or something like that )

http://yoursite.com/your-custom-page/?link_id=WHATEVER_THE_LINK_ID_IS_FROM_THE_WP_LINKS_TABLE_FORTHAT_LINK

Store the "external link url" in the wp_links' link_description field.
( Hopefully the URL would be less than 255 or you are toast. )

Let your-custom-page do a look up on the link_id passed thru the
query_string.
Do a db look up into wp_links to get to external url link and the excerpt
and do the necessary.

This approach solves my problem.
Unless anybody throws his 5 cents into this and offer a dramatically better
solution, I will go with this approach.

for future planning.. You'd be better off making a Custom Post Type
and storing the news articles in that instead, An extra 55k records is
not going to be a significant impact if stored as a CPT rather than a
post, the MySQL indexes will take care of separating it easily, you'll
also gain a lot more template functionality than you will with the
links table (As it's not designed to be queried, simply, displayed)

The future for the wp_links table is death IMO, It's not used by most
people, and is probably the one component in WordPress that I advocate
be removed and put into a plugin.
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18781

the Links table was introduced as a "Blogroll", back in the early days
of blogging as a "Here's a short list of my friends and my
relationship to them", not a "Here's thousands of links to external
sites that you can search through".

No, and you should use the specific functions of wp_insert_post and so forth.

Howdy,

What do you guys consider as the current "best practise" way, to 'boot 
strap' WordPress for use in another application/framework.

E.g., to give access to function suchs as "wp_insert_post", get_post and 
the WPDB class, but without loading the theme?

Thanks,
Robert

Include the wp-load.php file.

If you want just the basics and not all the various functions, you can
define SHORTINIT to true beforehand. But that's just the *very*
basics.

try this:
http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/index.htm

here's an example snippet that gives you the excerpts for a search on Julio
Iglesias:

<?php

 //create and load the HTML
    include('../simple_html_dom.php');
    //$html = new simple_html_dom();
    $html = file_get_html('https://www.google.com/search?q=julio+iglesias');
           //echo '$html: '.$html;
     foreach($html->find('div.s') as $element)
       //echo $element->text . '<br>';
      echo 'excerpt: ' . $element->plaintext . '<br /><br /><br />';
?>

Enjoy!

Thank you. These are the stuff that makes you want to be a programmer
right?
I cannot try it now but for sure in the next 2 days.

But for the time being, why did you comment this;

   //$html = new simple_html_dom();

Subject: [wp-hackers] changing the category base and then removing it all
 together and doing this back and forth
Message-ID: <CAHERW=1o1fTetX4OvaVqhvGacNrJpsfPMpVSjtYWApfOit+n3g@mail.gmail.com>

 Can I use the built-in category taxonomy as follows
 Media
Audio
Pictures
Videos
Articles
Apps
Audience
Beginners
Intermediate
Advanced
Featured
Main Headline
Slides
  Flagship
  Worth a look
  Not to miss

and then I have the following url options
 mysite.com/browseBy/media
mySite.com/browseBy/media/audio
 or
 mysite.com/media
mySite.com/media/audio
 Can I achieve these URLs by simply changing category base to "BrowseBy"
(for the first two URL example) and then some time later totally removing
the base ( for the last two URL examples).
 Are there any technical issues with such changes?
 Yes. I'm aware of the SEO implications of such changes but we are not at
launch phase. Once we launch, we will obviously stick to the launch state.

In addition to this question, I'd like to add the following too.

When I change the "category" base or remove it all together, what happens
to the register_taxonomy function. does get_taxonomies('','names') still
return "category" or does it return "browseBy"?

does register_taxonomy and and a taxonomy base name is related?

I left it in by accident. I was playing with a couple different examples
and I forgot to delete the unused code. The function get_file_html
apparently returns  an object that has the find method. I guess you don't
need to instantiate simple_html_dom directly, *or at least not in this in
this simple example.* I just tested it again---it works.

Hope this helps!

The con of using wpdb->insert over wp_insert_post is that you give up 
any future compatibility efforts, any data filters or action handlers 
that are put in place by plugins and/or themes and you would possibly 
avoid security methods that are built into the insert.

I would have never thought of "ever" using the wpdb->insert over the
corresponding wordpress function such as wp_insert_term, until the other
day where I saw in the core, the default installer routines chose the wpdb
route over the wp_insert. It's just a choice they made that way. It
confused me and I just wanted to double check . this issue is now over.

This does come with problems if you're loading it inside a function, as 
globals are set inside this without being explicitly declared as globals.

I find the following works:

	global $wp_the_query, $wp_query, $wp_rewrite, $wp;
	require_once(self::$wp_path . '/wp-load.php');

If you're running this on a mission critical site where you have to 
reduce queries, I also recommend setting:

	define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);

This ensures that you're never caught up with running cron tasks while 
trying to access anything.

Just to expand on this a little further, here's a walkthrough of how one 
piece of software we have links in with WordPress.

Each function/method that needs to use any WordPress feature calls 
load_wp(). load_wp() looks like this:

	public static function load_wp() {
		static $is_loaded = false;
		if ($is_loaded) {
			return;
		}

		if (empty(self::$wp_path)) {
			throw new Exception('WordPress could not be loaded', 500);
		}

		global $wp_the_query, $wp_query, $wp_rewrite, $wp;

		define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);

		require_once(self::$wp_path . '/wp-load.php');

		$is_loaded = true;
	}



What this does is ensure that:

a) WordPress is only loaded when needed (since this software 
incorporates other pieces of data from various systems)
b) WordPress is only loaded once regardless of how many times load_wp() 
is called
c) Globals are set up correctly (although this does miss some. A better 
solution would be an array_diff on get_defined_vars() before/after 
loading, and then globalising these. An even better solution would be if 
WordPress explicitly declared them as global to start with.
d) Cron is not loaded (this is for an API, so we want to avoid excess 
queries and work where possible)

Hopefully this helps. :)

(If this seems badly written, or slightly insane, it's because I'm 
slightly jetlagged, so apologies in advance.)

Subject: [wp-hackers]  WordPress Plugin for Multimedia page
Message-ID: <CAGcUGA_ABDtAJnWnhhEm5xxfdh-qpXXc4yxHPwCBz715CqmXGw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am looking for a plugin (hopefully completely for free) to create a
multimedia area in a website.

More precisely, I would like to use a plugin which allows me to upload
pictures (grouped in galleries) and videos and automatically display
them in a single page.
Alternatively, the plugin could create a hierarchy of pages in which
each page contains an item of my multimedia gallery.

In other words, a sort of plugin for portfolios.

Does anyone of you guys know a good plugin to do so?

I hope I was clear :)

Thanks

I know I'm going to get shot down for this but when I hear "hopefully completely for free" it really annoys me.
These requests stink of "thanks for all the hard work you put in, now sod off".

This is not necessarily aimed at you, Pasquale, but the plugin functions and facilities that some people require to work out of the box, that essentially are either way above the users skill level or save them hours upon hours of work - you want it all for free.

If the project is a personal one, at least have a go at building, researching a plugin that could possibly do what you're looking for then ask for help.

If it's for a client project - pay/ donate and claim it as part of the project fee.

By all means ask if there is such a plugin, but leave out the "I have no respect for your work so am not prepared to even consider paying for it" thinking.

I'm going to stop this rant now as I have to build a new plugin for BMW that allows the user to click a button and a brand new X6 is delivered within the hour - all for free.

Grrrrr ... etc.

Let me know when that BMW plugin is in the repository. :)


I do agree with you 100% though.

This seems to be a common thought about how people perceive value of free
software and how it sets their expectations... Just come across a nice

Hey, Joe,

I was going to write such a plugin for mortgages, to allow you to pay 
off your debt "for free", let's join forces to have house paid off and 
car delivered within the hour! Jokes aside, as a plugin developer, I'm 
with you 100%. That's why I'm thinking about switching to CodeCanyon or 
similar platform for my plugins...

Dino

Which  WordPress function is used when associating wp_ term_taxonomy IDs
with the wp_post IDs with PROGRAMMATICALLY.

And does that function have internal mechanisms to make sure that no
duplicate entries are allowed when being triggered programmatically.

Here of course I'm not talking about wpdb->insert - which will surely allow
duplicates unless mysql table is configured properly.

Hi Lee,

when I say "hopefully completely for free" I don't mean "I am not
prepared to consider paying the great work of someone else". I don't
see the connection.

Honestly, I paid for WordPress plugins several times, and I totally
agree with you when you say that the work of a developer MUST be paid
somehow, by donations or by a commercial license. I am more than happy
when I find a good plugin (even not for free) and I can help the
development of that plugin through a donation or by paying for a
commercial license.

Furthermore, I also am a developer and I developed two (free) plugins
for WordPress. So, I know very well what means working on a plugin or
anything else for days or even months.

In this case, I just asked you guys for a specific kind of plugin, if
I can find something helpful for free it's better, otherwise I am
"prepared" to pay, no problem ;)

In conclusion, I think that less than the 1% of you guys would pay for
a plugin when there is another plugin, with the same features, and
totally for free. Let me know if I am mistaken ;-)

As I stated, this wasn't necessarily aimed at you, so no finger pointing intended.

I've also contributed to the repo with (free) plugins and always go for a paid version over free or, at a minimum, contribute a percentage of a project fee to the developer.

How many WP developers have contributed back to WP itself (just out of interest)?

A simpler solution might be to register a separate custom taxonomy called
"browseby" and then just remove the regular category base.

I appreciate your feedback but I rather work with the built-in category
taxonomy for the theme support.

Are there any impossibiles to what I was asking? cause I'm not seeking an
*easier* route at this time.
I repeat the 2 questions I have for convenience purposes;

Can I use the built-in category taxonomy as follows

___Media
______Audio
______Pictures
______Videos
______Articles
______Apps
___Audience
______Beginners
______Intermediate
______Advanced
__Featured
______Main Headline
______Slides
______Flagship
______Worth a look
______Not to miss

 and then I have the following url options

  mysite.com/browseBy/media
  mySite.com/browseBy/media/audio

  or

  mysite.com/media
  mySite.com/media/audio

Can I achieve these URLs by simply changing category base to "BrowseBy"
for the first two URL examples

and then some time later totally removing the base for the last two URL
examples?


Are there any technical issues with such changes?


Yes. I'm aware of the SEO implications of such changes but we are not at
launch phase.
Once we launch, we will obviously stick to the launch state.


And on a second note...

When I change the "category" base or remove it all together, what happens
to the register_taxonomy function. does get_taxonomies('','names') still
return "category" or does it return "browseBy"?



But Eric, In the future, surely I will keep your advise though. I'm in
prototyping phase now.

Technically, yes to all of your questions. They can all be done. To remove
category as the base can be done but requires a little more code by by
adding BrowseBy as your category base you can achieve what you are asking.

Everything you are asking for WordPress does that built in and is just a matter of adding some attachment pages to your theme.

Maybe just add a taxonomy or custom post type where needed.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Multisites at different locations (neither
	domain-based, nor directory-based).
Message-ID: <4F8966CB.4050108@aegee.org>

Hello,

On my server I host a multi-site Wordpress 3.3.1 installation.  The 
different blogs shall appear under different URLs, that cannot be said 
as just "directory-bases multi-site" or "domain-based multi-site".  E.g. 
the word press multisite was installed under the URL 
"http://example.org/~user1".  Then some blogs were added 
"http://example.org/~user1/blog1" and "http://example.org/~user1/blog2". 
  Now, the user bought a domain "blog2.org", so the blog2 shall be 
visible under "http://blog2.org", "http://www.blog2.org" and 
"http://example.org/~user1/blog2".  However wordpress stores the links 
(of the uploaded pictures) as absolute links, so if the link is stored 
as "http://example.org/~user1/blog2/article3", when viewed under 
"http://blog2.org" the link will redirect to 
"http://example.org/~user1/blog2".

This shall be further extended with a third blog, which shall run under 
http://blog3.blog2.org .

Is there a way for the webserver to pass to index.php appropriate 
parameters (blog main URL, and "article-properties", e.g. 
wordpress-installation/index.php?blog=blog2&url=blog2.org&article=article3), 
so that Wordpress generates the right links in the resulting page (not 
referencing to http://example.org/~user1/blog2, but to 
http://blog2.org), and does not store internally the absolute URLs.

If there is currently no way to achieve this, and you agree that such a 
feature would be nice, but nobody wants to implement it, can you explain 
what needs to be changed approximately in the Wordpress core to have 
this feature there?

Thanks in advance for your answer

I think Wordpress.Com use a system like that. I never used the

It sounds like you want to map a domain to a users blog.. If thats the
case, you'll want to use a Domain Mapping plugin such as this one:

Subject: [wp-hackers] ordering the cats in a particular order
Message-ID: <CAHERW=0jzgTzsRDD0s6v0kHWfyJQ94xFm0R0hHMhn7EnuthPuA@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to define the order of category items ( or any
other hierarchical taxonomy for that matter ) in the admin UI when adding a
new post?

Example

Change this

cat1
     cat 1.1
     cat 1.2
     cat 1.3
cat2
     cat 2.1
     cat 2.2
cat3
     cat 3.1
     cat 3.2
          cat 3.1
          cat 3.2
cat4
          cat 4.1


to...

cat1
     cat 1.1
     cat 1.2
     cat 1.3
cat2
     cat 2.1
     cat 2.2
cat4
          cat 4.1
cat3
     cat 3.1
     cat 3.2
          cat 3.1
          cat 3.2


notice cat 3 and cat4 trees are switched.

Message-ID: <CAHERW=0jzQC7=VT=G50pO9Z=Q+PUZb5EQj55yWOJyHTio_hB5A@mail.gmail.com>

When the site visitor clicks on a tag term (such as "Apple"), he will
normally be taken to a url such as

"site.com/tag/apple" where wordpress returns all posts that have been
tagged as "apple".

Assuming the the visitor was on "Fruits" category when he clicked on an an
"apple" tag ( out of an excerpt of a post or something), and you want to
filter down the results to those posts that's been tagged as "apple" but
only if the post is in "fruits" category, what do you need to do to that
URL?

Message-ID: <CAJvdmtG_Jcq4Bg8HyUR=_c_kETmJhNM0pCwTfKYH-yKWj9hDVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have been using Debug Bar & Debug-Bar-Extender and they are mostly likely
what I need.

The problem with Debug-Bar-Extender is I can only get the message from the
profile tab -  which is too verbose, a lot of stuffs that I don't care.. I
just want a simple feature for logging purpose. (also besides the FirePHP
plugin, as I prefer to see the message in browser.)


Any suggestion?


Thanks.

Last time I tried it FirePHP, you could see the message in-browser, in the
Firebug console.

Hi Haluk,

I always used array unset to unset the objects I want to switch, then
append them back to an array and use ksort on it.
Example (switch finance and metals categories):

$categories = get_categories($args);
$finance = $categories[1];
unset($categories[1]);
$metals = $categories[4];
unset($categories[4]);
$categories[1]=$metals;
$categories[4]=$finance;
ksort($categories);

But maybe someone knows a more efficient way of doing it in WP.

Regards,
Alex

Here's a high-level view of how WP Super Cache works:
* When a page is loaded the first time it's cached and stored as a static
html file.
* When a person visits the site, there are rules in the .htaccess that
check if a cached (static) file is available.
* If there is, it simply serves that file and ends.

So basically none of your code is going to run on a cached page load
because it serves the static file.  Quite a while ago Donncha made it
mobile-friendly <http://ocaoimh.ie/2009/06/19/go-mobile-with-supercache/> (when
that post was made is was still in beta, but the code is in the released
version now).  You'll need to turn on "Mobile device support" and work from
there.  Basically it caches mobile versions of page on a per-device basis
and it sounds like your code is going to keep it from ever creating that
cache, so mobile devices should always end up running your code.

Thank you Alex.
What would be the hook for this so that the cats can be ordered in a
particular order?

I assume that you'll wrap all that array reordering into a function and
call it with a hook. Right?

I always keep it simple and tail the error log file on the server.  That 
allows you to also see syntax errors that produce a white screen.

Usually that means doing something like:
tail -f /usr/local/apache/logs/error_log

But if I can't find the file on a particular machine I'd add something 
like this to the wp-config file:
@ini_set('log_errors','On');
@ini_set('display_errors','Off');
@ini_set('error_log','/home/example/error_log');

And then that will put most all WordPress related errors and debug 
messages in that one file.

Then you can just call error_log( "Whatever you want" );  to put the 
message out there.

You can filter for specific prefixes in your error messages using grep 
or you can even look for your ip address:
tail -f /home/example/error_log|grep 127.1.2.3

If I'm tailing the error log on a windows PC I use baretail: 
http://www.baremetalsoft.com/baretail/
The free version meets all my needs so far.

Yes, I wrap it in a function. So far I used it directly in templates since
I needed certain functionality for sliders, tabs, etc. displaying
categories in particular order on specific pages, but you could call the
function on the hook you need.

I did a bit of Googling on the category hooks and, perhaps, this page could
be helpful:
http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks/hook/the_category

Alex

Alright,

I found this that you could probably use:
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/29033/better-way-to-enforce-category-hierarchy-in-post-categories-metabox

As of now, there is no direct filter on wp_terms_checklist. And replicating
the same code might not be the best idea.
There is, however, a plugin that seems to be working (haven't tested it
myself):
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/category-checklist-tree/

Hope, it helps.

Since it's written by scribu, I don't think we need to test it.

Yeah, true that.

He also uses the hook on add_meta_boxes as the article suggested, so you
could probably use that one to modify the list the way you want it.

Mika,

I created a url like this

mysite.com/devlib/?tag=apple

And I changed it to

mysite.com/devlib/?tag=apple+fruits as you suggested, but did not work. ( I
get the "Nothing Found.")

Would it have worked if I had enabled pretty URLs where the url takes the
form of .com/tag/apple

Or did  you misunderstand the question?

I just tested on ugly permalinks, and it works, too.

See test.ipstenu.org/?tag=chattels+privation 

Shows all three posts that are in both and ONLY both. Which I thought was what you meant when you said you wanted apples that are also in fruits. That's how it works.

thanks for the example. you misunderstood me.
in your example, both items you use are tags. "privation" is a tag and
"chattels" is a tag.

I my question, "apple" was a tag, "fruits" was a category.

The question was about getting about the posts that have been tagged with
"apple" but only if the post is in "fruits" CATEGORY.

Yes, but sometimes I will be switching browser, so better to have the error

Hi Haluk,

I answered your question yesterday but it looks like my email got
swallowed by the list. I wrote:

"I think Haluk was talking about intersecting tags and categories, in
which case it would be something like
example.com/category/fruit/?tag=apple or, alternatively,
example.com/tag/apple/?category_name=fruit"

I needed to change the order of categories in the metabox to re-alpha-sort
them because for some reason my Arabic site's categories were not in Arabic
"alphabetical" order. The closest thing I found to a filter for the
checklist was to use the *get_terms* filter and perform my manipulations
there.

Obviously this could have unintended effects in other parts of the site,
but at the same time it might have quite desirable effects in those same
places. It's likely that if you want a certain order in wp-admin, you also
want it when displaying lists of categories anywhere else.

The important thing is to be careful to only filter it at times when
get_terms() is already using the kind of data that the checkbox uses and
that your filtering function assumes is there. Specifically *$args['fields']
= all* and *$args['orderby']  = name*. Your filtering function that works
on the list of objects will completely destroy an array of IDs! (learned
that the hard way)

Here's the code I ended up with, which seems to work well for me.

function gv_filter_get_terms($terms, $taxonomies, $args) {

/**
 * Only run this filter if we're fetching the default fields 'all'
 * avoids trying to object-filter lists of ids or names.
 */
 if ('all' != $args['fields'])
return $terms;
 /**
 * Only sort if 'orderby' is 'name'. It's the default so it will still be
'name' if fields='ids'
 */
if ( 'name' == $args['orderby'] )
 usort( $terms, '_usort_terms_by_name' ); // usort func is part of wp core

 reset ( $terms );
 return $terms;
}
add_filter('get_terms', 'gv_filter_get_terms', 10, 3);

Obviously you'll want to replace the *usort()* line with whatever
manipulations you want to do.

IIRC get_terms runs itself recursively when you have a hierarchical
taxonomy, so this will run several times, once for top-level parents, then
once for each set of children/grandchildren. In my case this wasn't an
issue because I just wanted to enforce alpha-sorting within each set of
categories, but it might make your life more complicated if you decide to
go this route.

Message-ID: <000001cd1c5f$76ebd410$64c37c30$@fris.net>

I been racking my head around this and cant seem to find a solution for
getting a custom field of a post, just returns empty.

	global $post;
	$args = array('numberposts' => $number, 'post_type' => 'bookmarks',
'orderby' => $sortby, 'order' => $order, 'meta_key' => 'bookmark-url');
	$myposts = get_posts( $args );
	foreach( $myposts as $post ) : setup_postdata($post); ?> 
	<?php global $wp_query; ?>
	<?php $url =
get_post_meta($wp_query->queried_object->ID,'bookmark-url',true); ?>
	<a href="<?php echo $url; ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a>
	<?php endforeach; ?>

Here is the part of code where its not outputting the custom field for the
bookmarks post type

Also tried $post->ID for get_post_meta.

Anyone have any ideas?

Thx

Try only this:

$args = array('numberposts' => $number, 'post_type' => 'bookmarks',
'orderby' => $sortby, 'order' => $order, 'meta_key' => 'bookmark-url');
       $myposts = get_posts( $args );
       foreach( $myposts as $post ) : ?>
       <?php $url = get_post_meta($post->ID,'bookmark-url',true); ?>
***can't remember if ID or post_ID
       <a href="<?php echo $url; ?>"><?php $post->post_title; ?></a>
       <?php endforeach; ?>

Message-ID: <CAHERW=06uyU0rcL2APQBSp9G-bp_r2wT5u1cndstaQe+f2PZNA@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to force WP
to not to create different term_ids and slugs (in the wp_terms table)
when two terms under the same taxonomy are spelled
differently only by the case?

Example venus vs VENUS vs Venus.

The above example gives me 3 different terms, 3 different urls, and my
posts are diluted.

Hi
Anyone knows if it would be possible to implement an email exchange
panel withing a WP installation? Would the current email database
handlers in the core be able to support it? I wanted to ask you guys
before venturing into something totally wacko I am never gonna get my
legs out of, since I am quite new to PHP.
Thanks!

Hi,

there is a BuddyPress plugin that adds forum/social network features to the
website. It provides the system of private and public messages.

Not sure what exactly you would like to built though. If you would like to
have an external email system, like with email address for a user that
could be used to send a message from the outside of the website, it could
be done potentially, but I would use an external email system provider as
opposed to having to handle emails on your own server. That would require
way too many resources.

Wordpress stores emails of the registered users, so it could be used to
send emails, but it doesn't provide an email associated with the domain.
That would be handles by the server and would depend on your hosting
package.

Regards,
Alex

Actually, I was thinking something along the lines of an interface
that can manage emails from within WP (or a private page of WP) that
is just connected to the external email server. Sort of thunderbird
but without downloading the emails.

Hi
Anyone knows if it would be possible to implement an email exchange panel
withing a WP installation? Would the current email database handlers in the
core be able to support it? I wanted to ask you guys before venturing into
something totally wacko I am never gonna get my legs out of, since I am
quite new to PHP.
Thanks!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Overriding bulk upgrading
Message-ID: <4F8DFB4C.90001@rotorised.com>

Good morning hackers,

Has anyone had experience with overriding the bulk upgrader? 
Specifically, I'm looking to override the process for a few select 
plugins and execute my own instead.

 From what I've seen so far, you essentially have to filter on something 
like admin_init and remove the plugins from the GET variable, before 
running your own bulk upgrader after the normal one. There are 
approximately zero filters in the bulk upgrader that I can use, without 
resorting to something like pre_option_*/pre_transient_*, which still 
doesn't give me enough control.

I'll be filing a bug on Trac to add more filters, but I need a backwards 
compatible solution.

Thoughts?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Comment administration inefficiencies - Proposing core
	change
Message-ID: <CAEk_d2Hv6VvqQ2p4DrC+DU6j22ZyPDRKKrPixmO=jqxxjwqxxg@mail.gmail.com>

Recent listener, first time caller.

I work on a large news oriented WP site and first off, it actually scales
remarkably well. We keep users, comments, and actual posts all in
WordPress. However, due to our size, administering comments is causing us
issues at the moment.

Our last outage was caused by one of our comment moderators doing a simple
comment search in the admin. The query took 16 seconds to execute, the next
query locked, and, with our traffic, the DB couldn't handle the resulting
queued traffic.

Staying away from discussions of "you should use Disqus" or, "you need more
X for your mysql server," I think there is significant opportunity to
improve the way WP handles comment searching. Every comment search takes
the following form:

SELECT * FROM wp_comments  WHERE ( comment_approved = '0' OR
comment_approved = '1' ) AND (comment_author LIKE '%TERM%' OR
comment_author_email LIKE '%TERM%' OR comment_author_url LIKE '%TERM%' OR
comment_author_IP LIKE '%TERM%' OR comment_content LIKE '%TERM%') ORDER BY
comment_date_gmt DESC LIMIT #;

As we can all see, this is a beast of a query. Even when the term is
clearly an specific term (say an email or IP), or when the intent of the
admin is known (e.g. clicking the IP link on a specific comment).
Furthermore, there are no hooks activated in this process for plugins to
use to say create an advanced comment search plugin. One might expect hooks
like those activated in post search to be activated here, like
"parse_request" and "get_search_query."

Waxing philosophical, as posts, comments, and users are the three basic
types of data to be stored and displayed in WP, one would expect them to
have similar interfaces and functionality. They each have basic
functionality of being able to retrieve a single item, a list (in full or
in part), search for an element, or edit a single entry. For this reason I
don't understand why each of their functionality isn't derived from
something like an abstract class or an interface. The architecture here is
also difficult in that you are not able to replace or extend a single class
to change the functionality.

Back on target. I propose that we add functionality by which we'll be able
to search by exact match in addition to the existing full wildcard (left,
right, or full wildcard is probably excessive) as well as specifying the
field to search. This would allow my earlier use case of searching by IP to
look for an exact match in the "comment_author_IP" field only, not
searching the fulltext of every comment.

This functionality can be created simply by:

   1. Adding "search_type" and "search_field" to the
   WP_Comment_Query::query_vars data structure in wp_includes/comment.php
   2. Replacing WP_Comment_Query::get_search_sql with something more
   robust, able to understand these new properties and construct the query on
   their basis
   3. Upgrading WP_Comments_List_Table::prepare_items to accept the new
   queries and add them to the data structure it creates
   4. Either modifying WP_List_Table::search_box to have some options of
   advanced search, or dropping a hook so that a plugin can easily modify it
   5. Modifying the WP_Comments_List_Table::column_author to supply the
   correct query string to indicate an IP search

I believe that will do what I'm looking for. Adding efficiency for
everyone--particularly those who have lots of comments. If I can figure out
a way to make this more similar to the signature of posts and users, or at
least add some hooks at the right places, I can do that as well.

I am planning on modifying our core for this support, but I would like to
contribute it to the community as well. Obviously I would be happy to
submit a patch of my implementation.

This isn't my experience.

I'd have to check the code to confirm, but I believe this can only happen if the mysql collation is case sensitive.

Can you confirm what collation is set for the wp terms table?

A limited but incredibly useful list of actions sorted by the order they
first fire is on the Codex Action Reference:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference#Actions_Run_During_a_Typical_Request

For diagnostic info you're probably best-off putting it in the footer then
using jQuery to show it at the top. Better yet, why not investigate the
Debug Bar plugin's API for adding panels and use that. I haven't tried it
but it's probably pretty simple and there are other plugins that use it:

Message-ID: <CAHERW=0_tkbdvVv_zkxgaqJHNv7ZFNALVWAZsUcArdSmRWb7WQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a built in wordpress function that let's me look up the
"parent" field of the "wp_term_taxonomy" table if I pass the TT_ID to
it?

something like

get_value ( $wp_table_name, $id_fieldname, $id_value,
$the_field_info_to_retrieve )

Example
get_value ( "wp_term_taxonomy", "term_taxonomy_id", "parent");

Here is the code you can test it on a fresh install.
adding sub cats to wp programmatically causes weird behavior on the
dashboard. This has been a show stopper for me.

<?php

error_reporting (E_ALL); 	

//load the wp shebang into this page
include ("F:\inetpub\wwwroot\Accounts\Dev.tjara.com\ic2\wp-load.php");
//your path here!

define('WP_USE_THEMES', false);


//add a sub under the uncategorized
$Term = "Sub-UnCategorized";
$args =	array('parent' => 1 );	
   //by assigning parent to be 1, I'm telling WordYress to make the
"Sub-UnCategorized" a child of "Uncategorized".

wp_insert_term($Term, "category", $args);
   // this line will add the wp_term and wp_term_taxonomy records properly.
   //this ends up getting the tt_id of 3 on a fresh install for the
   //this is so because id 1 goes for the uncat/category, id 2 goes
for the blogroll/link_category tt_ids

//Let's add another sub under the above sub - making it a grand child of
$Term = "Sub-Sub-UnCategorized";
$args =	array('parent' => 3 );	
wp_insert_term($Term, "category", $args);

echo "Done.<p>Go check your categories on the dashboard now. <p>You
will notice that the Sub-Sub-UnCategorized is missing from the view,
even though the same dashboard reports that there are <i>3
items</i>.<p>But what's funny is the dropdown. Check the dropdown for
the <i>parent</i> selection, you will see that the missing
Sub-Sub-UnCategorized is there. Go figure!";


echo "<hr>In order to get the missing sub-sub into the view, you will
have to do two things. <ol><li>Add a dummy cat.<li>Click on the
categories link on the admin navigation.</ol>";

Subject: [wp-hackers] jQuery UI Sortable in widget admin interface
Message-ID: <4F91D787.8080002@digitalbrands.com>

Hi all,

I am extending a custom widget to provide a sortable list of authors. 
I'm finding the list does not let me sort it...

I am able to generate the markup easily enough. I have ensured the 
trigger for the sortable method is set to run on document.ready and 
after dependencies (jquery & jquery-ui) have been loaded.

To top that off, code I put in jquery-ui event handlers executes, and no 
errors are recorded in firefox's error_console.

I've tested the same code in a JS fiddle ( http://jsfiddle.net/Mn3sv/ ), 
and it works without any issues (as it should).

Is there anything that would interfere with the dragging behavior for a 
sortable in the widget page in the WP admin interface?

Instead of dragging to sort the LI items, the text simply gets selected 
instead. For something so simple, it is giving me a lot of trouble to 
get working.

Thanks for any help!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Issue with Custom Post Type Archive and custom search
	form
Message-ID: <4F91DAA7.1040604@gmail.com>

I'm creating a plugin that sets up a job board for a client's website. I 
set up a custom post type for the job openings and a custom taxonomy for 
job opening categories.

When I set up the custom post type, I set it to have have an archive 
page. The code for my CPT is below.

$labels = array(
                     'name'                  => _x('Job Openings', 'post 
type general name'),
                     'singular_name'         => _x('Job Opening', 'post 
type singular name'),
                     'add_new'               => _x('Add New', 
'job_opening'),
                     'add_new_item'          => __('Add New Job Opening'),
                     'edit_item'             => __('Edit Job Opening'),
                     'new_item'              => __('New Job Opening'),
                     'view_item'             => __('View Job Opening'),
                     'search_items'          => __('Search Job Openings'),
                     'not_found'             => __('No job openings found'),
                     'not_found_in_trash'    => __('No job openings 
found in Trash'),
                     'parent_item_colon'     => __('Parent Job Opening:'),
                     'menu_name'             => __('Job Openings')
                 );

         $args = array(
                     'labels'                => $labels,
                     'public'                => true,

                     'show_ui'               => true,

                     'query_var'             => true,
                     'capability_type'       => 'post',
                     'hierarchical'          => false,
                     'menu_position'         => 20,
                     'supports'              => array('title', 'editor',

                     'rewrite'               => array('slug' => 
'job-board/%post_id%', 'with_front' => false)
                 );


I have a custom template for the archive for my custom post type. On 
that template, I have added a search form to filter down the results by 
keyword, category (custom taxonomy), author, and a couple custom meta 
values. The form is posting to the archive page.

I'm hooking into the *request* filter to add my filters to the query ... 
add_filter('request', array(&$this, 'modify_job_board_archive_query'));

Things are working just fine except for when I filter by category or 
author. When I filter by category, the category archive template is used 
rather than the custom post type archive template. Same thing with the 
author ... author archive template is used.

I can't figure out where to hook into to make sure that my custom post 
type archive template is used.

Any ideas? Or won't I be able to hook into the core WordPress 
functionality for this?

Thanks in advance.

Becky

Hi Jeremy,

It sounds like you don't have jquery-ui-sortable properly enqueued. (The
jquery-ui in wordpress only includes jQuery UI-core; you have to also
explicitly add jQuery-UI-sortable).

Something like this should work, if your theme scripts are in
my-theme-javascript.js:

wp_enqueue_script( 'my-sortable-script',
                            get_stylesheet_directory_uri() .
'/my-theme-javascript.js',
                            array( "jquery", "jquery-ui-core",
"jquery-ui-sortable" ) );


Hope that helps?

It seems with the reference, the code also work

E.g.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter

Change:

<?php add_filter('media_upload_newtab',?array(&$this,
'media_upload_mycallback'));??>

To:

<?php add_filter('media_upload_newtab', array($this,
'media_upload_mycallback')); ?>

Why I am passing $this as reference if I do not expect it modify the
value of $this? (I suppose it is bad), right?

Subject: [wp-hackers] request for coordinated change (bugfix) to simplepie
	and wordpress
Message-ID: <Pine.BSM.4.64L.1204211849070.27380@herc.mirbsd.org>

Hi,

first of all, simplepie developers, sorry for directly mailing you,
but I could not find out how to work this Yahoo thing you have in
lieu of a proper mailing list. You might want to add documentation
for that ;-) (The rationale for eMail here is to keep everyone in-
volved, that is both upstream and Debian packagers for both word-
press and simplepie plus me as integrator, in the loop.)

In Evolvis/FusionForge we set the PHP error loglevel very high and
overlay the pages sent out with an ugly pink popup if there are PHP
errors or the page is invalid XHTML, to educate developers and fix
such problems immediately (on development systems only, of course).
Now we (or rather, some code from Codendi, another SourceForge de-
rivate, imported into FusionForge) use simplepie for parsing RSS
and displaying it on a project homepage. Imagine my joy when I saw
that I had to fix simplepie, too. (And others?)

Well, said, done. Unfortunately, this change is not liked by Wordpress:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=669054

So I'm hereby asking you, both upstreams, to coordinatedly apply the
bugfix and make the classmethod static, since create() should never
have been an instancemethod in the first place.

This means, in the class SimplePie_Cache and all its derivates, such
as WP_Feed_Cache, the method create() must be made static:

-	function create($location, $filename, $extension)
+	static function create($location, $filename, $extension)

Ref: http://patch-tracker.debian.org/patch/series/view/simplepie/1.2.1-3/assigning_the_return_value_of_new_by_reference_is_now_deprecated.patch

The Debian package also contains other fixes you might probably want
to integrate.


Thanks in advance for your cooperation,

Because in PHP4, if you didn't pass by reference, a new instance would be
created. I updated the Codex page.

It works on my local server, and another server, but on a shared hosting

It's worth noting that this plugin hasn't been updated since 2010 and
the plugin automatically overwrites a core file
(wp-includes/plugin.php) so may cause you problems both during its use
and after it has been deactivated.

You might look at /wp-admin/edit-form-advanced.php, where
do_action('add_meta_boxes') is called. add_meta_boxes_{$post_type} may be
of interest to you.

And, as mentioned, the priority may help.

Hi Becky,

When WordPress knows what kind of query is currently going, the template is
guessed, then called with a filter named 'template_redirect'.
You can hook on that filter to make sure it's your template that will be
included.
But make sure you don't break any other query than yours by making this,
like a normal archive or author query...

Hope that helps.
Lionel

You can use one of these methods:
- Using 'admin_head' hook. It's not exactly for this purpose, but it works.
- Or better, you the same 'add_meta_boxes' hook with very high priority,
such as 9999, and in the callback function, you call remove_meta_box().

You can use the plugin Debug Objects
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/debug-objects/

this plugin can list the hooks on the current page, there you are viewed.
and on this list you find the hooks and also the functions, there hook in this
example screenshot on page to edit a post:

 search form

I ended up figuring it out and thought I'd share in case anyone else is 
having the same issue.

I was already hooking into the "single_template" and "archive_template" 
filters to get WordPress to use my custom templates with my plugin for 
the single page and archive pages. That was working just fine.

I am now also hooking into the "template_include" filter (which is run 
after the other two) and checking if the page being displayed is for my 
custom post type AND if my custom search is being done [by checking for 
a hidden value I added to my custom search form]. If both are true, I'm 
telling WordPress to use my custom post archive template. That worked. :)

The other queries are working just fine for everything else on the site.

Subject: [wp-hackers] jQuery UI Sortable in widget admin interface
Message-ID: <4F95676B.7060602@digitalbrands.com>

Thanks for your reply, Nathaniel.

I had already enqueued it similarly, but since these things can be 
easily caused by minor errors, I went ahead and swapped my enqueueing 
code out for yours.

I am experiencing the same end result as before: The list-items in my 
unordered list are not sortable, but event actions I write for the 
sortable instance are executed.

To give an example of some of the PHP involved, I have a standard widget 
extending WP_Widget, and the admin-interface form section has the 
following code generating the relevant markup:

<ul id="sortable">
<?php
$users = get_users();
foreach( $users as $user ) {
?>
<li><?php echo $user->{"display_name"}; ?></li>
<?php
}
?>
</ul>

I have the enqueue code declared separately, outside of the class file.
Viewing the page, I am able to see the enqueued javascript, which is 
loaded after its jquery/jquery-ui related dependencies (--with the 
enqueue code you provided, the page has the script tags printed in the 
same order).

I'm not quite sure what is causing this to not be sortable. If any other 
code snippets would be helpful, I can send those as well.

Thanks,

Jeremy Hough

Sounds like it may have had security issues? Perhaps asking
plugins at wordpress.org can tell you more?

The plugin directory is constantly being cleaned up. Plugins get closed 
for security issues, but de-listed from search results when they haven't 
been updated in a long time (they should really be updated with each new 
release after testing for compatibility, even if it's just the readme).

John,

Are you certain this plugin overwrites wp-includes/plugin.php?  I installed
it, ran it, deactivated it and just checked this file, which was at 3.4 beta
2 and the dates still aligned with a fresh copy of the file from the
WordPress download ZIP.  I do agree, however, it isn't up-to-date.

Jeff

Subject: [wp-hackers] Extending WP_Widget_Factory
Message-ID: <CAHmMi3jb51=WCdiZY-i00+fznHq2uZCOEdJkj8wFr3DyANKT=w@mail.gmail.com>

I ran into an issue recently where I needed to make multiple calls?of
register_widget on the same class and have multiple unique widgets
registered. The problem I ran into is that every time the same class
is called it will overwrite the last instance of the same class during
the widget constructor request parent::__construct('unique_id',
'widget title'); After pouring through the /wp-includes/widgets.php
code I found that if I were to extend the register method to pass
through arguments into the extended WP_Widget constructor that I can
reuse the same class for multiple widget registations. Currently I am
directly bypassing the register_widget(); method to extend the
WP_Widget_Factory class directly and instantiating it through a loop.
Here is a sample of what I am suggestion for extension of the widget
factory and that this would also be added into the register_widget()
method as a secondary argument.

class Extend_WP_Widget_Factory extends WP_Widget_Factory {

	// Overload register($widget_class) with ability to pass parameters
into widgets
	function register($widget_class, $param = null) {
		$this->widgets[$widget_class] = new $widget_class($param);
	}

}

class Extend_Widget_Builder_Display extends WP_Widget {

		function Extend_Widget_Builder_Display($param = null) {
			extract($param);
			$widget_ops = array( 'classname' => 'widge_' . $UniqueID);
			$control_ops = array( 'id_base' => 'widget_' . $UniqueID );
			parent::__construct( 'widget_' . $UniqueID, __($UniqueID,
'unique_domain'), $widget_ops, $control_ops );
		}
}

Does anyone see why this wouldn't be a good idea to add into core as a
default option?

Being able to pass parameters to widget constructors seems like a good
idea. It would make it easier to re-use code.

Care to open a ticket on trac?

What is the recommended method for reconstructing the current URL on the

$url = get_admin_url() . $pagenow . '?' . $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] ;

Is there a better solution?  I couldn't find a WordPress function to return

Message-ID: <CAAeEKQMnAH331ShYk+pgAQM_LLUqwsjnWNTXj1wvYLQ8LvLKiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Hackers,

I have a custom post type and I want to enable revisions.

I know that in register_post_type() I can pass in the 'revisions'
option in the 'supports' array but this doesn't support post meta,
right?

I saw there is a filter '_wp_post_revision_fields' but according to
ticket #13382 it won't do because this runs only once.

Any other approaches I can take? Hints?

Thanks,

That's basically correct, although I'd do it this way:

global $pagenow;
$url = admin_url($pagenow.'?'.$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']);

$url = add_query_arg();

That gives you an URL relative to the domain root.

Hi,  

That's done by the wp_install_defaults() function, which you can redefine to do nothing or set different default content for your sites.

There doesn't seem to be much documentation on the function you provided in
the Codex.  On another note would you know how to hook into the Add New
Site page to add options upon site creation?

What issue are you having?  Is it just not working, returning an error,
returning bad data?  Have you tried using that function with other URLs to
make sure it's just not a bad link?

Actually I figured it out, on the host it didn't create the uploads dir to

Sorry, I think I was dead wrong when I said that you can do it from a plugin.  Looking at the core source, you may need to create a file at wp-content/install.php with your wp_install_defaults() function definition in order for this to work.  

This blog post is a bit old, but provides a nice tutorial:

http://wpbits.wordpress.com/2007/08/10/automating-wordpress-customizations-the-installphp-way/

wp_install_defaults() is called when you create a new multisite blog (via wpmu_create_blog(), which also triggers a "wpmu_new_blog" action). So you can still have wp_install_defaults() do nothing and then set default content by hooking a function to that action.

I never tried adding options to the interface, but I imagine it shouldn't be hard to write a wp_install_defaults() function / wpmu_new_blog callback to set defaults based on your form's output. Just bear in mind that wpmu_create_blog() is called both when adding a new site via the admin panel and when a new user registers for a site.

Cheers,

Thanks Luis

Still having trouble locating the documentation on the install.php and
function in the codex.  I'd like to know exactly when it's initiated and
how we can pass values to it, etc...

Your best bet would be to look at the core source code, I'm afraid. wp_install_defaults() is defined at /wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php, along with other potentially useful functions.

The WPMU functions used to create new sites are located at /wp-includes/ms-functions.php.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Unique slugs (title form urls) vor area codes in
 different custom post types?
Message-ID: <4F97D56C.80506@fob-marketing.de>

I do not know if it is a bug or a feature. Can anybody help?

I registered two custom post types. Both should make use of their own 
taxonomies. One of these taxonomies is a section where administrators 
can fill in area codes to choose from when it comes to a post. So we 
added all the numbers two times, one code per post type. Each of the 
terms (area code numbers) can have a number, a description and a title 
form to be used in urls.

Everything seemed to work like a charme - but now we recognized that if 
we change a url for one of those area codes we automatically update this 
area code within the other custom post type. This lets us run into 
trouble. The issue seems to be that in most of the cases both custom 
post types use the same "tag id". Only where this is not the case it 
works like expected.

Taxonomies are registered like this:

"

|register_taxonomy('nachhilfe-nach-plz', array('fob_nachhilfeorte'),
	array( 'public' =>  true, 'hierarchical' =>  true, 'query_var' =>  true,
	'rewrite' =>  array('slug' =>  'abacus-nachhilfe-orte/nachhilfe-nach-postleitzahl', 'with_front' =>  false),
	'show_in_nav_menus' =>  true, 'labels' =>  array('name' =>  __( 'Postleitzahlen' ), 'singular_name' =>  __( 'Postleitzahl')) ) );

  register_taxonomy('schulen-nach-plz', array('fob_schulen'),
	array( 'public' =>  true, 'hierarchical' =>  true, 'query_var' =>  true,
	'rewrite' =>  array('slug' =>  'abacus-nachhilfe-schulen/schulen-nach-postleitzahl', 'with_front' =>  false),
	'show_in_nav_menus' =>  true, 'labels' =>  array('name' =>  __( 'Postleitzahlen' ), 'singular_name' =>  __( 'Postleitzahl')) ) );

"
|

We want to have unique slugs for area codes because one is meant for 
schools and the other one is meant for educational trainings. Let me 
give you an example where it works: 22337 
<http://www.nachhilfe-in-hamburg.de/abacus-nachhilfe-schulen/schulen-nach-postleitzahl/nachhilfe-schulen-22337-hamburg/> 
vs. 22337 
<http://www.nachhilfe-in-hamburg.de/abacus-nachhilfe-orte/nachhilfe-nach-postleitzahl/nachhilfe-22337-hamburg/> 
and where it does NOT work as expected: 22297 
<http://www.nachhilfe-in-hamburg.de/abacus-nachhilfe-schulen/schulen-nach-postleitzahl/nachhilfe-22297-hamburg/> 
vs. 22297 
<http://www.nachhilfe-in-hamburg.de/abacus-nachhilfe-orte/nachhilfe-nach-postleitzahl/nachhilfe-22297-hamburg/> 
(because one slug overwrites the other one here).

In most of the cases it does not work as expected. May be there is a 
trick for better separation of these entries to make them unique on both 
sides?

members only):

Message-ID: <CAJvdmtG0r5fSiZ8wGc=GBSoG+QNLu20myVkZ0TqP6XF6FhTT2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Seems register_activation_hook not support closure but not throwing out error?

e.g.

        register_activation_hook(__FILE__, function() {
            update_option('myplugin_activated', 1);
        });


However, register_uninstall_hook do throw out that closure cannot be
serialized error if I use closure.

The warning won't be generated from register_activation_hook(), or at
least, I don't expect it will be, as it's internally simply
add_action()

register_uninstall_hook() however does serialize things, and would
probably throw an error like that. as the "hook" needs to be stored in
the database for later usage..
Have a look at the docs of that one here:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/plugin.php#L647

Hello Everyone,

I have been lurkin for months, it's time to contribute!

Installing WordPress without posts... that makes me think that the default
theme needs changed, or a plugin needs activated sometime during the
installation. I have no idea if that is possible, but it smells like
modifying core.

What I do, is add this to the theme functions file:

//Trash the sample page and sample post
 wp_delete_post(1);
wp_delete_post(2);

It works, because the default post and page are always #ID 1 and 2.

Here's a paste example from the functions.php of a multisite theme that
sets itself up with default pages.
http://pastebin.com/7yJ1KBEH

The pages are still created, but that will automatically delete them, and
let you make the pages you want to. (Even set the page template!)

-Taylor

Just for the record, registering hooks using closures is typically a bad
idea because they can't be removed later with `remove_action()`.

Yes, but using closures made the code more clean and reabable. We
don't use remove_action in our own plugin.

Thanks all for your feedback.

I don't think it's more clean and readable than a good and expicit method
name, that doesn't force you to read the code put in a closure to
understand what it's made on that hook.

Plus, if you're designing a plugin that may be released in the WordPress
repo, you should let your users decide to let your hooks in place or not.
You should maybe take into account that everybody doesn't have PHP >= 5.3
and that methods will break with the older platforms...

But if you're developing a plugin for your own needs, make it the way you
want, of course.

Also important to note: it will most likely not work with 
create_function() either, as the internal function created changes its 
name each request.

(Might be worth testing though)

I agree that anonymous functions/closures can be much nicer, but I'd 
avoid using them for activation/deactivation anyway. Those should be 
named methods in your class instead, IMHO.

(I use anonymous functions/closures for a lot of quick hooks, and for 
array_map/array_filter calls personally, but anything more than a few 
lines I move into a proper function/method.)

Hi Haluk,

Doing this: $term = get_term($term_id, $taxonomy);
And then $term->parent, you get its parent.

But it's with the term_id, you should never access the term_taxonomy_id
since it's only a "link" ID.

To your actual question, the base cannot be changed using a base WordPress
install, but it can be done using various plugins, for example
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-author-base/

I believe you also need a plugin to remove the custom taxonomy base from
your URLs, but I'm not positive on this.

If you want your posts to be site.com/author/joe (and yes, that plugin is what you need to change /author/ to anything), you would need to change the username of 'admin.'

If you're NOT using Multisite, it's not that hard. Just edit the database. If you ARE, though, and this is probably smarter in the long run anyway, make a new user called joe. Transfer all the posts to joe.

(You can delete admin if you want, or disable it, after that.)

Right, term_taxonomy_id is purely internal. No APIs expose it as a function
argument. That is why you always need to pass $term_id *and* $taxonomy (or
a $term object) to most functions.

Post meta is not currently revisioned and there is no way via the API to
simply add support for it. You may wish to look at
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/revision-manager/.

It's entirely possible to revision post meta. I've been meaning to
write a post about it for ages and this thread coming up again
prompted me to finish it. See

Oh as usual I probably should have clicked that link before posting.
The Revision Manager plugin gives you a nice way of adding revisions
to post meta fields.

Hi Chris,

This function is defined in the pluggable.php file, which is included
*after* the plugins, since this is designed to be overwritten by them.
So you have to wrap your code in a function that could be called on the
'plugins_loaded' hook for example.

You don't need to test is_user_logged_in(). current_user_can() will fail if
the user is not logged in.

Message-ID: <CAGeLs_EipPA8quKhokJzjZCzQQAK8xZHfRkfW-941qKDwp+FQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
WP has introduced custom menus since 3.X (I believe), which are
located at this URL in the installation nav-menus.php

The problem is that when I try localizing my theme I get stuck on the
custom menu words. Since they are stored in the DB as text, a php
funtion like <?php _e('Home', my_theme); ?> doesn't work.

I could not find any documentation on custom menus localization. How
do you do it?

Thanks!

Since the Custom Menus are actually "Custom", i.e. they can't be hardcoded
as they depend on user input, I think that you should rely on some
translation plugin here for the content itself.

WPML guide on custom menu translation -
http://wpml.org/documentation/getting-started-guide/translating-menus/

I've seen qTranslate handling this as well, but not sure if it happens
without coding.

Thanks for your reply,
I realize that, but I do not want to use WPML or qtranslate.
Xili-language seems a better one, though I need localization. I can't
figure out why a core function does not include a localization
workaround.

Oh well, I will just do without custom menus.

Thanks!

So I found out why one of my plugins was removed, one of the javascripts
wasn't GPL.

Does it have to be GPL? I found another script, but its BSD.

Thanks.

BSD is fine as it's GPL-compatible, so I doubt that's your issue.

I thin Chris is asking if he can substitute his current script which is non-GPL (and presumably non-BSD) with a BSD script (?another script?). Chris, as Ryan notes, BSD code can be used with GPL code (since BSD is a more ?liberal? license).

Subject: [wp-hackers] RFC: On solving WordPress automatically adding -2,
	-3 to the permalink
Message-ID: <CAJvdmtFuTVctYVdvbjUjyqXDW6qCOHJX-pJYacMjqSk4NVu0_A@mail.gmail.com>

WordPress does not allow post_name to have the same value, even we
have used the explicit ID as the permalink format -
/products/{post_name}/{post_ID}

e.g.

What we want:
http://www.example.com/products/foo/1
http://www.example.com/products/foo/2

What we get currently:
http://www.example.com/products/foo/1
http://www.example.com/products/foo-2/2


To solve this, we have write a plugin:
================================


        add_filter('post_type_link', function($link, $post = 0) {

            if ($post->post_type == 'product')
            {
                $postName = sanitize_title($post->post_title, $post->post_name);

                return home_url(sprintf('products/%s/%d', $postName,
$post->ID));
            }
            else
            {
                return $link;
            }
        }, 1, 3)
;
================================


Seems to be working, any comment and drawback I havn't think of?

Thanks.

Just looking quickly at this perhaps 'foo' should be a taxonomy of products rather than a post_name (slug).

This is one of the option, but for our use case, a product can belongs
to many categories, so we don't want duplicated content.

Thanks.

You wouldn't want to do this on init - it will run those queries on every page load, which is massively inefficient. And you wouldn't use $wpdb's update wrapper to change the options table, you want the update_option function. 

If you want to change themes, I would recommend the switch_theme function: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/switch_theme

I'm not sure how you're triggering this, but you only want to do it once (such as on plugin activation)

And another method is to add a filter to 'stylesheet' and 'template'
which will filter the theme at runtime without changing anything in
the database.

if you're going to do this for whatever reason, consider adding it to the theme_redirect instead of the init and also including a wrapper around it and use the switch_theme() instead.

add_action( 'template_redirect' , 'change_theme_manually' );
function change_theme_maually() {

    if ( 'twentyeleven' != get_current_theme() )
         switch_theme( 'twentyeleven' );

}

I've not tested that, but it should work.

So the first problem here is that by using a front-end hook to writer to
the database, you risk running write queries on the frontend. That is
something you always want to avoid.

I would use a hybrid approach. On init, use the stylesheet and template
filters suggested by John. Then use switch_theme() if is_admin().
Additionally, use map_meta_cap to disable the switch_themes cap.

The second problem is that get_current_theme() returns the theme *name* ?
as in, "Twenty Eleven". (The function is also deprecated in 3.4.) You want
get_stylesheet() for "twentyeleven".

Note that current user is set up later, so 'init' would be the correct
hook here:

This code also never had a chance of working, pay close attention to
the args of update() and the database schema you're updating. It's not
designed to work in the way you attempted to use it.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb#UPDATE_rows

The correct usage would've been something like this for each option
you wanted to apply to:
$wpdb->update( $wpdb->options,
  array( 'option_value' => $newtheme ), // new row data
  array( 'option_name' => 'template' ) // the WHERE clause for which
row to affect
);

That's just a quick lesson on $wpdb->update() since no-one seemed to
pick up on it :)
However, like everyone has already mentioned, there are far better
ways to achieve what you were trying..

Message-ID: <CB21E65C-5E29-4FBB-8B24-1A576E4D9237@a5d.org>

Here's one where I'm stumped (regularly happens, I know!)

I have a custom post type (Photos) -> each CPT can be added to various categories.

I need to pull info from the same CPT and also a specific category, depending on which page you're on.

For example:
Current page: Shops
Category: London
CPT: Photos

or

Current page: Shops > London
Category: Sweets
CPT: Photos

There are many, many pages and categories.

My question - Can the category be pulled dynamically (by ID or name) depending on which page you're on?

<?php $loop = new WP_Query( array( 'post_type' => 'shops', 'showposts' => 999, 'category' => 'THIS NEEDS TO BE DYNAMIC DEPENDING ON WHAT PAGE YOU'RE ON' ) ); ?>
<?php while ( $loop->have_posts() ) : $loop->the_post(); ?>

... do some stuff ...

<?php endwhile; ?>

This one has had me stumped for at least a good while, and might be simply staring me in the face, so I thank you in advance for any pointers.

Hello,

I am running WordPress v3.3.2 and having some issues configuring the server to use SSH2 to allow autoupdate.  The options I am receiving on the admin panel are FTP and FTPS, I have seen articles mentioning that SSH2 should appear in the options for update but it does not appear.

I have installed SSH2 and implemented the following in my php.ini file for php5fpm.

extension=ssh2.so      

Can anyone lend any insight on this?

I have this code:  http://pastebin.com/Cuup4NHw creating Custom Post Type
and taxonomy.

Because I used the "lab/%categoria%" in permalink structure, i have used a
page template to my Custom Post Type posts list. (page-lab.php)

But my problem is in *taxonomy-categoria.php* template.... When I run
page/2/, I got 404 page error.

My permalink structure is: *http://my-site.com.br/lab/categoria* .. and
this works

But *http://my-site.com.br/lab/categoria/page/2* doesn't work =(

Please, what can I do to fix this?


Thanks in advance!

Dumb question: Did you restart your webserver after making the change?
Extension has to get loaded and such, and if you didn't restart, then
the FastCGI processes holding your PHP processes won't have reloaded
and the INI won't have been read.

The check in core to make the option appear is this:

if ( extension_loaded('ssh2') && function_exists('stream_get_contents') )

So make sure you have streams enabled too.

Hi Otto,

Thank you for the quick reply.  I did restart everything except for php5-fpm which did the trick after a restart.  After some more research into this method it seems it may not be very secure. Does anyone have any thoughts or opinions on this?  

I am planning on implementing a user specifically for WordPress access via FTP to allow for automated upgrading of plugins and core.

Thanks again,

Jeff

I think you can use "/lab/categoria", not need to append the %.

I really think the problem is tax slug ... CPT slug is /lab/%categoria%/
(%categoria% is a placeholder that receives the taxonomy terms) TAX slug is
/lab/ When I run site.com/lab/TERM/page/2, WordPress give me 404 error ...
=( I'm so sad..

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp>insert fails
Message-ID: <CAHERW=1ssiTjVd5OGwYQR_UEq1tXoV2qnxbZYYDzv339ep8Yiw@mail.gmail.com>

In the process of bringing/migrating some 50,000 (post-like) records
from microsoft sql into wp, I run into mysql insert errors. Some weird
characters here and there create a mysql error. that  happens in maybe
0.55 of the whole recordset. To skip those records and move on with
the migration, I had to put an @ sign in front of the insert statement
so PHP does not stop for the error. But I do not want to completely
ignore those 0.5%.

What character filtering technique do I use to take the post content
as is  - simply ignoring those weird characters if any?
Those characters could be rangin from smart quotes to some weird
french or poland characters that somehow has a problem with
wp/mysql/insert operation?

Is there a "filter_to_utf8" function or something to that effect?

Probably totally offtopic, but did you consider another approach?
Like use git[1] (because its faster and simple to set up) and a cron task.

No offense, but creating another user, enabling sftp and whatever else,  
seems like an overhead for me.

We would need to see the taxonomy-categoria.php and the page-lab.php
to know what exactly it is that your issue is here.

In what way do you think it is not secure?

Subject: [wp-hackers] featuring posts is a problem
Message-ID: <CAHERW=3Ab+a-AMX1Yb3P8D-FwWVKFhwyH2-HmsVt9pVVs5oiLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Let's say you have a category called "featured". and you use that to
feature posts. And the theme you have has a zone to show those
featured posts and has room to show the last 5 featured posts in
there.

And you want to make the admin work as easy as possible to the degree
that you only want to find yourself checking the posts into that
"featured" category and you do NOT want to uncheck them later. You are
basically only checking, and never unchecking.

The problem is WP uses post_data to find out the most recent posts.
But then, what do you do when you want to feature a very old post? how
do you deal with that? Change the post_date?

If you were to select that post into the "featured" category, that
post is not going to make it into the top 5 because the other posts
that happened to be "featured" and more recent may easily be pushing
it down.

In this case, I got no choice but change the the post_date of the
article and this seems totally wrong to me. Because this definitely
messes the ARCHIEVE data integrity. Your 5 year old post will appear
as brand new.

What solutions are out there to address this problem?

I almost think that the wp_posts table should have a special field
called "post_feature_date".

If we were to use the "stick posts" feature, that's not gonna cut it
neither because remember, I'm only interested in checking things, NOT
UNCHECKING THINGS.

If you got a simple blog, I do understand that this issue is not a
matter but if you are using the WP to the rim in managing a huge
portal, then you want to save every maintenance step as possible.

same question  is in case you prefer the answer there;

Wouldn't 'orderby' => 'modified' do the job?

I thought of that but let's say you fix a spelling an error on an old
post ( that was featured say 3 mts ago ), would that cause that guy to
be featured right at the front - just because you fixed a spelling
error - causing the post_modified to be updated?

I read somewhere about permissions on the private keys could be an issue but after further investigation this does not seem to be the case.  I am not all that familiar with updating WordPress in this way and was mainly looking to get more info.

Thank you,

Jeff

This would work for WordPress but not plugins.  Another issue is at time people need to update WP without the technical know how of GIT.

@*Diana*, I'm using this scheme:
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/49141/rewriting-a-custom-post-type-permalink-with-taxonomy-term

but I'm getting 404 error when I go to page 2 ... =(

*@Otto*, my taxonomy-categoria.php: http://pastebin.com/rE97sCLd
page-lab.php: http://pastebin.com/Lc764Kiw

I need fix the permalink structure to accept this:

http://site.com/my-post-type-slug/my-tax-term/page/2 ... etc.. etc....

Thanks!

Drika
