Subject: [wp-hackers] Portable tokenising from the shell
Message-ID: <50BA36E4.6070009@wordshell.net>

Hi,

Some of you may remember an earlier discussion about parsing JSON 
output, which is one of the formats available from api.wordpress.org. 
JSON was the most suitable for portably parsing from a Bourne/Bash shell.

This guy has implemented such a parser already: 
http://github.com/dominictarr/JSON.sh

One part of the parser is this. It's the tokeniser, splitting up the 
JSON into parts:

     local ESCAPE='(\\[^u[:cntrl:]]|\\u[0-9a-fA-F]{4})'
     local CHAR='[^[:cntrl:]"\\]'
     local STRING="\"$CHAR*($ESCAPE$CHAR*)*\""
     local NUMBER='-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)([.][0-9]*)?([eE][+-]?[0-9]*)?'
     local KEYWORD='null|false|true'
     local SPACE='[[:space:]]+'
     grep -E -o "$STRING|$NUMBER|$KEYWORD|$SPACE|."

It's an interesting use of grep; basically it matches *everything*, but 
splits it up based on certain separators, in a certain order.

However... my research shows that the "-o" switch (which causes grep to 
output only each matched portion, one per line) is not part of POSIX, 
but is nonetheless available in GNU (hence Linux and Cygwin), 
Free/Net/OpenBSD and Mac OS X - but not in Solaris (either in the grep 
in /usr/bin or in /usr/xpg4/bin).

So it's not quite totally portable. My question: does anyone have 
sufficient sed or awk skills to advise me how to reproduce the above in 
one of those? As I said, it's a tokeniser, that splits the input into 
the discrete chunks indicated. I'm an awk novice. I'm trying to write 
code that assumes only POSIX, or failing that the common subset of 
GNU/BSD/Mac/Solaris. If I fail I can use various hacks (e.g. search for 
perl, use that if found, search for PHP, use that), but it'd be nice if 
I didn't have to resort to multiple code paths in that way.

Many thanks,
David

This guy seems to have a json parser written in awk. Dunno if that
will help any.

Does the UCB version of grep support all the right flags?

I believe that .com runs trunk as a multisite installation, so barring some
kind of magic, all users would be on the same version.

To piggyback on that, though, I'm curious about the rest of the server
environment running on wordpress.com, specifically what PHP version is
used. I just searched to see if I could find a blog post anywhere
describing that, but didn't come up with anything.

We run "trunk" within reason. Depending on the current stability of
trunk, we try to keep as close to HEAD as possible. When there's
something big (e.g. the recent media changes) we wait until it's
pretty stable before running it on WordPress.com

Generally speaking all users are running the same code. There are some
exceptions to that, but generally speaking that's the case.

We currently run PHP 5.3 in production; looking to update to 5.4 soon.

Looks like a mix, but mostly 5.1.x.

There are some core hacks, yes. Every release we remove more and more
of those tho :) I don't think there are too many left now, most
functionality is just modified/added via plugins/hooks/filters.

This answer is coming from someone who has zero access to and almost no
knowledge of the WP.com codebase (I don't work for Automattic), but
learning how companies use (and abuse) core is very important to my job, so
I ask lots of questions:

Let's face it, MU on the whole was just one giant nasty core hack. After
3.0 when MU was merged in, the number of hacks they had dropped
precipitously. They also used customized (read: hacked-to-hell) super admin
panels until core did a network admin in 3.1. Hacks for things like adding
hooks, fixing bugs, etc., do happen, but at the end of the day they
typically get submitted back to core and processed like any other bug
report or enhancement request. (When you host tens of millions of sites on
thousands of servers and you have to submit code back to core the same way
everyone else does, a hack here and there is just gonna happen, even though
kittens everywhere run.[1])

As Beau said, pretty much everything is just plugins, including the new
front-end dashboard.

enable us to create new admin themes/interfaces, and be completely

I don't think I looked in the wrong places, but I could not find plugins 
to do these jobs (or possibly, not without adding a huge amount of other 
functionality as well). So, I've recently written and uploaded three 
plugins into the WordPress plugin directory. The first two may be 
particularly useful to others on this list who manage or maintain other 
peoples' sites.

1. Use Administrator Password - log in to anyone's account using your 
admin password (zero configuration).
2. No Weak Passwords - forbid the 5634 passwords from OpenWall's list of 
most-common passwords (zero configuration).
3. Add Email Signature - add a fixed signature to every outgoing email; 
useful for branding/legal requirements.

Longer descriptions and links to the WP plugin directory pages here:

Thank you,
David

I think I want to do this (and then some) in 3.6 or 3.7.

The only downside of your solution would be that you'd need to know the
person's username.

One of my oft-installed plugins is
John Blackbourn's User Switching plugin, which allows administrators to
switch to any user. http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-switching/

I've seen several plugins that let you customize all the outgoing emails in
their entirety (I don't think that counts as adding a huge amount of other
functionality).

That said, the more, the merrier. :)

+1000000 to User Switching. Far better for workflow than logging in and out.

Is there such a thing? I googled for a bit, but could not manage to even 
confirm that Solaris has a grep in /usr/ucb, much less find a man page 
for it. I should download a Solaris VM and find out... but my net 
connection isn't up to that where I am stationed presently...

Looks interesting. I know very little awk, but looking through that and 
seeing what it does, it looks like the "split" function may duplicate 
the function of that use of grep. I'll try it out...

Thanks,
David

Subject: [wp-hackers] Strange limbo - /wp-admin turned non-functional
 without harcoded {SECURE_}AUTH_COOKIE
Message-ID: <50BD0037.5090304@kraav.com>

Hi all


Hoping to find some know-how here about a strange occurrence. During a 
debugging session which included a die() somewhere in or near 
plugins_loaded hook, a multisite /wp-admin managed to turn itself into a 
pretty solid wall-like "You do not have enough permissions to access 
this page" state. WP complains in WP_DEBUG that SECURE_AUTH_COOKIE is 
not defined during the request. Clearing the browser cache and history 
does not help, as a matter of fact /wp-admin/ is rendered non-functional 
for everyone registered.

Resetting authentication keys does not help.

Two things seem to work around this:

  * wp-config.php -> define( "AUTH_COOKIE", "somevalue" ), same for 
SECURE_AUTH_COOKIE
  * disable WPML SitePress plugin -> very difficult, since the site 
completely lives on it

I will be going through disabling all other plugins one by one when I 
can pick a spot for some downtime. But in the meanwhile I'd like to ask 
is perhaps there anything in the database I could clean out that's 
related to those cookie constants? Any theories what could be going 
wrong here re the cookies?

Been running tens of sites with the WPML configuration, never seen this 
before.

	image size=0x0
Message-ID: <CAB7RyRdVDscPpYO57nBGSWChq0B5Z0igg9SqxkTyH5woipwLRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Wordpress Hackers,

I'm having an issue with a site migration and I can't seem to figure out
the deal. I hope this is a correct forum for such a problem. I have a
client who wants to a) transfer her site to Bluehost and b) register a new
domain as her primary domain. As Bluehost allows domain registration, I
registered a new hosting account and domain at the same time and set the
new domain as the primary domain for this account. The plan is to get the
site moved, then redirect the old URL to the new one once its all set up.
This allows me to keep the old one going for as long as it takes to get the
new one dialed. The old site has BackupBuddy, so I followed the steps for
migrating a site. I love BackupBuddy and this process has normally worked
perfectly when I've done it before. However, this time I can't seem to get
the thumbnails to register and all the images in my media library show
sizes of "0x0". If I go in and edit an image, the link properly directs to
the new uploads directory properly and if I copy/paste the link into a new
browser page it shows properly. I have tried regenerating all the
thumbnails; however, the plugin "doesn't find" any of the images it is to
regenerate the thumbnails for.

I have tried exporting the site several times in various manners and always
seem to get the same result: Media Library shows no thumbnails and image
sizes are 0x0.

Has anybody ever encountered this, or can anyone point me in the direction
of a solution? I'm flummoxed.

Jason

If the domain name or path info changed, its possible that a plugin
serialized the image path and is counting the number of characters. You'll
see something like a:37{c:http://domain.com/asfd/blah.jpg} (that's just a
guess, don't have a moment to look up what it actually looks like.

Also, awesome name man. ;)

Well, some additional backtracing pointed the arrow directly to WPML. I 
have probably located the cause now.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WooCommerce & subscriptions - advice please
Message-ID: <50BD852B.9080904@slingshot.co.nz>

Hi all,

I'm building a shop using WooCommerce for a fitness training
outfit. They want to give clients the option of purchasing
their training packages by making two or four part-payments
over a set period. Which I guess is a form of subscription.
Paypal is one of the gateways which will be used.

This is the first time I've worked with WooCommerce, so I'm
asking for advice on alternatives;

I see that WooCommerce offers a premium "subscriptions" plugin,
which I assume will do the job. Has anyone had experience working
with this plugin / extension?

Does anyone know of another ( pre-coded ) alternative to buying
this plugin for managing the relatively simple scheme above?
Has anyone attempted to code their own extension or plugin to
deal with the situation above? How difficult / successful was
that?

Can the variations be managed from within the paypal account,
without the need for an upgrade to WooCommerce?

Is there another WooCommerce extension or WordPress plugin you
know about which will do the job?

Or would I be better to simply bite the bullet, and stump up
for the extension?

Any advice / thoughts appreciated.

best,

I do have a preference for plugins that do one thing, well. The one 
similar plugin I could find was "WP Better Emails", but that creates a 
multipart email and only touches the HTML, leaving the text/plain part 
as-is. I just wanted to add a signature to the text/plain part and not 
have any text/html at all. As I say, I may just have not looked in the 
right places. I found others that did not fit my needs.

Thanks for the link, it looks very good.

Mine differs in its approach - it aims for multiple concurrent logins, 
rather than one which is switched. Under my approach, you can log in as 
an administrator, then open a separate browser session (use 'Private 
Browsing'), and log in there as another user - but you only need to know 
your own administrator password. Then if there's work that needs doing 
in configuring WordPress as an admin, whilst testing the effects on the 
user, you're not switching back and forth between logins (only between 
browser viewports).

Hi all,

I've used this plugin and it's fantastic. It's very extensible in code,
and the developer is a great developer and is always adding new features
and fixing bugs.

I've talked to the developer about the plugin, and there are a lot of
nuances involved in the plugin (especially when working with PayPal)
that would make it fairly hard to write your own. Brent's done a lot of
work with this and understands the various problems behind it.

I'd definitely recommend using it, and the price isn't that high for the
quality of the plugin.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Querying OAuth protected service during 'wp_login'
Message-ID: <CA+A0KTFkqvjp3Z-Okrd2U60SEA_NqXNLNy71cWquwXdBP-qjCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to create a plugin "voot-role" that needs to query a remote
OAuth (2.0) protected resource server to determine the role the user
that logged in will get at the blog. The plugin gets triggered on the
'wp_login' action to obtain an access token (if non is available yet)
and query the service to determine the role. This all works great, but
so far I'm unable to figure out the best way to deal with the login
when no OAuth access token is available yet. When the user logs in and
an access_token is available all is fine.

So the flow:

1. wp_login registered action gets triggered
2. plugin uses OAuth client API to check if OAuth token is available
3a: yes: use access token to query OAuth RS
3b. no: <do OAuth stuff which obtains access token at remote OAuth
authorization server where it gets redirected to and redirect back to
Wordpress after success>

The problem now is that in step 3b when the user is redirected back to
Wordpress, the user is already logged in and thus the wp_login action
is not triggered again (if the user logs out and in again path 3a is
followed, so all is fine). I was looking into using the
'auth_cookie_valid' action, but this action is triggered all the time
(even multiple times per page load it seems) so it is not so smart to
hook into this action with the plugin (for efficiency reasons, it
would query the remote service every time, and I only want this on
wp_login, the role is not updated that often).

Is there a better way to do this? Store a key/value in the session
cookie to trigger obtaining the role from the server right after the
redirect and unset this key/value after doing this?

The code I'm working on:
https://github.com/fkooman/wordpress-voot-role-plugin/blob/external_client/voot-roles.php

Thanks in advance!

Regards,
Fran?ois

You could hook into the 'check_password' filter instead and do your
oAuth request there if the username/password combo is correct. If your
oAuth request fails you can them return false (and maybe also a
wp_error object, you'll need to check) and the user won't get logged
in. Then you should be able to hook into the 'login_errors' or
'login_messages' filters to display an appropriate message.

Hope this helps!

Agree with Ryan.  I have used the WooCommerce subscriptions plugin before 
as well and it works well plus the support is very good.

There are some other options out there - like s2member for one.  These 
are both huge projects - trying to code something that handled this 
yourself would be extremely time consuming.

Try the 'authenticate' filter instead. It gets three parameters, the
WP_User object (or null), the username and the password (which may be
empty). It's expected to return a valid WP_User or a WP_Error, or the
original $user parameter if it's doing nothing.

So this, for example, will just log everybody in as user number 1:

add_filter('authenticate','dangerous_admin_login', 10, 3);
function dangerous_admin_login($user, $username, $password) {
  return new WP_User(1);
}

But, you can do more useful things with it, because this is how the
password check and cookie checks are hooked in.

The username/password check is hooked in at priority 20. It will
return a WP_Error when there's no username and password.

The cookie check is hooked in later, at priority 30. It validates the
authentication cookie, then replaces that WP_Error by returning a
valid WP_User when the cookie is valid.

If you hook in at, say, priority 40, then you can see that the user
has either successfully logged in (via username/password or via
cookie), and do what you want to do. If what you do should invalidate
their login, then you can just return your own WP_Error here,
overriding the previous two checks. The message from the WP_Error will
automatically get spit out onto the login screen. If they check out,
then you can just return the same WP_User you got in the first place,
and they'll be logged in.

Note that this authentication process happens every request, so you
may want to save something as usermeta so that you don't repeat your
OAuth stuff every time, and can just check that first and skip it if
they've successfully auth'd before.

Alternatively, if you want to tie your authentication into another
system entirely, you could hook in at priority 10, do your
authentication check, and *create* a new user in the WP database
corresponding to whatever your user-list is, or pull the proper
WP_User if the user already exists in WP. As long as you return a
WP_User object, the password check and the cookie check will simply
pass through and let the login happen. Note that the cookie-setting
code happens after this, so by returning a valid WP_User, then that
person will get the proper cookie and won't be needing to enter the
username and password all the time, since the cookie check will detect
them next time.

I won't be attempting to code this myself, that's for sure.

Subject: [wp-hackers] slugs and the "-2" post fix
Message-ID: <CAHERW=3Q00M-o5Xbqeiirm2J8_1MS+ohXHbBbZnF4RAHx62j=Q@mail.gmail.com>

I have two questions that deal with terms' being end up with  "-2"
postfix in their slugs. I run into those when I programmatically
create the posts/tags/terms.

My first question has to do with terms' being case sensitive...
that's one of the two ways resulting a term being end up with a "-2"
in its slug.

example:

If I create a term like "tree" in the "post_tag" taxonomy, it gets a
slug of "tree".
if I create another term say "Tree" in the same taxonomy, then the new
term gets the slug of "tree-2". Even though, I mean the same thing.
I'm curious to know what's the wisdom behind this default behavior and
if there is any way to force/tell WP to ignore the case so both terms
be it TREE or tree get the same slug.

My second question is on the other situation where two identical
terms' being end up with the "-2" situation. And this only happens
when the terms belong to different taxonomies.

example

term "apple" created in the "computers" taxonomy gets the slug of "apple".
and the term "apple" created in the "fruits" taxonomy gets the slug of
"apple-2". this puzzles the heck out of me. I can understand the first
situation that I mentioned above to some degree, but this one, totally
silences me.

why can't both terms have "apple" as their slug?

WP would still work with both URLs anyway.
domain.com/computers/apple
domain.com/fruits/apple

the current behavior results me to end up with
domain.com/fruits/apple-2 which does not look professional at all.

Any insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you

Subject: [wp-hackers] Integrate menu plugin in the core
Message-ID: <CABOiy-kemoRr62B3zbmzAaOG-D=ZZfK25+xAePdGv1X1LRLD3w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have never wrote an email to this list, so hope I'm not breaking any
standards or doing it wrong.
We have developed a plugin (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codepress-menu/) which we think adds
some handy functionality to the wp_nav_menu()

Would it be an idea to integrate the level parameter and how it interacts
with depth to the core?
If you think it might be an idea we can enhance the current walker to make
it work together.

Any pointers would be great.

Best,

David

Thanks for your help!

It can also get WP_Error if no one is logged in... Apparently even at
priority 40 it gets triggered when displaying the login screen, so I
had to add a instanceof check.

There seems to be a problem here: the user is no longer logged in
automatically after returning from the OAuth server redirect, I get
the login prompt again. Although after logging in everything works as
expected (the role gets set). It seems somewhere something goes wrong
regarding the cookie validation? Not sure where the problem is...

The updated code:
https://github.com/fkooman/wordpress-voot-role-plugin/blob/external_client/voot-roles.php

I think I return WP_User everywhere where needed?

Yeah, I've implemented that now... it does seem to work :)

Yeah, that is something used by the simplesamlphp-authentication
plugin I think... I just want to setup the roles :)

Thanks again for your help!

Are you redirecting the user's browser to do authentication? Because
you can't do that in an authenticate action, the login credentials
won't be there when they come back.

The authenticate action happens *every* request, not just on the login
screen or something like that. It should go get the information from
wherever without extra user interaction. If you need to send them
elsewhere and back, then you need to do that before authenticate, in
which case wp-login or something might be preferred.

Message-ID: <CAOwP8kxqJmB7KE94QOvPOUtA5ScfisCwjTAODwozzR5jB_+0Jw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
  I am having a strange issue that I am sure has a simple solution but is
throwing me for a loop ( uh, yeah I did )...

  I have created a bunch of Custom Taxonomies [ 'merchant',
'coupon-category', 'deal-type' ] and a Custom Post Type [ 'coupon' ].
Everything works great until I go ahead and enable pretty-permalinks.  At
this point I get a 404 when I try to visit any Taxonomy archive page.  I
have set up taxonomy-merchant.php and so on but the rewrite rules don't
seem to function correctly.

  There are a bunch of articles online about this sort of thing but I have
yet to find anything concrete on this issue.  I am registering the CPT and
Taxonomies like this: https://gist.github.com/4217653

  I have tried flushing the rewrite rules in every way possible as I am
sure that would be most peoples first reaction.  If anyone could provide
any direction or feedback it would be greatly appreciated.

Ryan,

I tested your snippet on trunk and couldn't reproduce your problem, though
I also haven't created taxonomy-*.php files for each of the taxonomies. I
un-commented the rewrite rules for coupon-category, deal-type and merchant
with no problem. The archives display as expected with permalinks turned
on. All I did to flush the rules was visit Settings > Permalinks and saved
the changes.

Perhaps it's something in your archives.

Drew

Thanks for taking a look Drew.  I turned off all templates except for
index.php and still get the 404.  Is there any way you could shoot over a
copy of your htaccess when it is working?  I've disabled any Plugins that I
am using and checked permissions just in case there was some sort of issue
with those.

Thanks,
Ryan

Go to Permalinks options and save options (this flushes the rules).

In the past I had the same problem with Custom Post Types and I don't
remember why :S

Try this code in your functions.php. Works like a charm.

function flush_site_rules(){
global $wp_rewrite;
$wp_rewrite->flush_rules();
}
add_filter("wp_loaded","flush_site_rules");


Don't forget to delete it when finished :)

Well, that gets me closer.  Flushing the rules like below on wp_loaded
works, until I comment out the filter.  Then the 404's return.

"Try this code in your functions.php. Works like a charm.

function flush_site_rules(){
global $wp_rewrite;
$wp_rewrite->flush_rules();
}
add_filter("wp_loaded","flush_
site_rules");

I always use flush_rewrite_rules(true); i wonder if that will make a
difference.

Actually it seems the other code already did a hard flush, i want sure if
that was just doing a soft flush but it does a hard flush too.

For clarification:  I had a line running 'flush_rewrite_rules()' that
defaults to a hard flush.  This didn't affect the 404 page (I was not
running it in any action).  The code the ran a filter on 'wp_loaded' works
except for that once it is removed the 404 page returns.

Debug your rewrite_rules. Make sure they're getting saved properly in
the database, and that the options table isn't locked or something.

Thank you everyone for your help.  I was finally able to hunt this down.
It turns out that a plugin I was using was actually flushing the rewrite
rules (always) and messing with my settings.  I must have missed this
somehow the first time through.  Sorry for the trouble and I very much
appreciate everyone that chipped in as always.

Just curious if anyone can tell me if deprecated features are ever removed,
I am looking at utilizing a depreciated feature to avoid hacking core for a
particularly unique use-case where the replacement feature will not work
for my needs.

What is the deprecated feature you are using, and why won't the replacement
work?

We don't remove the functions themselves, but we have been known to render
them non-functional to keep up with future changes.

I was looking at using my-hacks.php I have a very specific use-case where I
need to write a mu-plugin but I cannot have it in wp-content wither the
other plugins. I am hosting sites for clients and they have access to
wp-content to manage their own plugins, themes, ect. I need to add
functionality where they cannot access the code. I considered writing an
mu-plugin which just includes another file outside of wp-content where the
actual code would reside but I don't want the clients removing it. I was
just going to hack core to include a file in the root WordPress directory
where all the plugins are loaded and saw the reference to my-hacks. At
least until that gets taken out all together I can avoid hacking core I
figured and just was wondering what the chances of it being removed are.

When you say they need to have wp-content access... do they have SSH/FTP 
access? Or just 'We can upload plugins and themes and images'?

An mu-plugin can't be turned off, and IIRC it can't be edited by the 
in-admin editor.

my-hacks?! Wow, was not expecting that one.

We almost removed my-hacks all together a few versions ago. Every time I am
reminded of its existence, I am reminded I have always wanted to remove
it. Wouldn't be surprised if we actually do it one time.

First off, mu-plugins doesn't need to exist inside wp-content. It can exist
elsewhere, you can set it with WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR and WPMU_PLUGIN_URL in
wp-config.php.

Or, since you expressed a preference for them to still control mu-plugins
(why, I'm not sure, it's really designed for this kind of advanced usage),
you can simply specify your own custom directory, then have that directory
additionally include everything in wp-content/mu-plugins, just like core
does.

The only thing you'd need to do is filter plugins_url() (where
WPMU_PLUGIN_URL is used), to ensure that any instances of plugins_url() in
their mu-plugins point to the right place. Or, define DIR in one place
(yours) but URL in the other place (theirs), and make sure any plugin_url()
calls you have in your mu-plugins work. So:

define('WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR', '/secret-plugins' );
define('WPMU_PLUGIN_URL', '/wp-content/mu-plugins' );
and copy-paste-modify the directory-traversing code
from wp_get_mu_plugins().

You still need to be careful about file permissions, of course. They can
easily run PHP code to locate that file, read it, and depending, edit it.
They could also run PHP code that unhooks it or otherwise mitigate what
your code does.

So, the lesson is: don't let users run untrusted code if you want a closed
environment. Really not sure how we got here from my-hacks.php and
deprecated functions, but here we are. (Please be a bit less obtuse
and ambiguous when posting to the list.)

The only concern with leaving it where the end user can access it is being
accidentally deleted i don't know why anyone would want our need to effort
it delete it from their own plugin code.

Assuming this is a Linux based server, can't you just remove write access
for their user to that plugin directory/file? Even if they can reverse that
themselves, that would at least prevent casual removal of your plugin. And
if they can use chmod, and are willing to go through all those extra steps
to remove your plugin thats their own damn fault.

Remember, if you build an idiot proof system the world will just build a
bigger idiot.

I think the best way to define via constant the adress, like below

// Custom content directory
define( 'WP_CONTENT_DIR',  dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/wp-content' );
define( 'WP_CONTENT_URL',  'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/wp-content' );
// Custom plugin directory
define( 'WP_PLUGIN_DIR',   dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/wp-plugins' );
define( 'WP_PLUGIN_URL',   'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/wp-plugins' );
// Custom mu plugin directory
define( 'WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR', dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/wpmu-plugins' );
define( 'WPMU_PLUGIN_URL', 'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] .
'/wpmu-plugins' );

see: https://github.com/bueltge/WordPress-Starter


But you acan always go a extremly cusomt way via custom directory for
different wp plugins; use this idea and solution:

My reply [1] said nothing about leaving it where you think the end user can
access it. It instead covered two things:
 1. A solution to your problem as you described it.
 2. Why your problem does not allow for a secure solution.

Message-ID: <CAH9UVvHGHB1ZRqFWMXTihTCHOD+vJnVGbvY5GE849yW4nLtS=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I write  a small plugin for test taxonomies on the new media library.
Thanks for the nice work and new media library with more possibilities.
Before was the effort much higher for this requirement.

But a question; maybe a bug/feature or bug in my plugin.

Here you find the small plugin:
https://gist.github.com/4223861

and here 2 different screenshots; in the thikcbox view is the hierarchical
taxonmies "Categories" not with the active categies usefull.

If I register a custom post type ('books'), I can manage the columns with a
specific filter: manage_books_posts_columns.

Is there a specific filter I can use on the new/update page to nicely
enqueue some custom styles? Or will I have to add a post type check?

That's how it's supposed to work - just an input with a comma separated
list of term slugs. It's not really end-user-friendly, but I think given
that the focus on the new modal (which isn't Thickbox, by the way - we're
slowly trying to rid ourselves of that outdated, unkempt thing) was really
on the insert and gallery workflows this time around, it's fine. I actually
think that's how it was before if you enabled a taxonomy as well, so
nothing new. It's just more tempting to add them now that the edit view
actually does something with the UI automagically. There's also now a flag
for whether or not to show a compat field (via attachment_fields_to_edit)
in the modal, so you can hide it there if you think it not useful. Example
code: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22759#comment:1

I'd love to think about how we could examine the management workflow next,
after 3.5, but right at this moment I think there's a handful of us that
should probably be sleeping instead. It was a little bit of a late one :)

I'm back now to my original approach using wp_login action and the
auth_cookie_valid, because in both hooks it is possible the browser
gets redirected. First if no OAuth access token is available (during
wp_login), and later if the access token appears valid but is rejected
because the user revoked the access token (during auth_cookie_valid).
I'm using now the set_user_meta and get_user_meta to indicate whether
or not the roles should be retrieved.

Maybe some optimizations are still possible in this scenario? Thanks
so far for your assistance! The latest code can be found here:

Let me restate this...your "security issue" about users bring able to
modify or read my code via their own script or being able to unhook it is
not a concern, accidental deletion was the issue i am trying to avoid.

In fact if that was a concern i could just as easily use a core hack to
include my code to avoid unhooking and use regular scans to detect and
reverse any modifications. Using myhacks was a way to avoid hacking core as
i was not aware of being able to change the mu-plugins directory. There is
no need to be so defensive and adversarial.

@Nacin just to show no hard feelings I was going to submit a patch to
remove it but apparently someone beat me to it 3 years ago but apparently
that was too early to remove it.

Hi Helen,
thanks for reply.
I would that the hackers see the difference; the hierarchical taxonomie is
in the edit screen of a attachment with chekcboxes, hierarchical view; but
not in the thickbox.
Yes, this is to lat for 3.5 and not the problem; a cut for a release is
important.
But for me is important, is this result of my small plugin right, the
current default or my error.
Maybe I can enhance the core for a solution in 3.6; add a patch for the
same view in each view of attachments

best wishes
Frank

I'm not totally sure what your reply means :) I said:

list of term slugs.

Meaning that is the correct result and the current default for all
taxonomies, hierarchical or not.

No, in the edit view is the categories a list of tag with a checkbox, the
tag is only a input field.
I mean, that the hierarchical taxonmies always list all tax with the
hierarchical tree.

see the difference on the screenshots, on the red arrows.

The edit screen is the same as it is for any post type, so taxonomies show
their usual metaboxes based on whether it is hierarchical or
non-hierarchical. The modal ? which, again, is not Thickbox ? shows a
single line input with any assigned terms appearing as comma-separated
slugs.

So, I repeat: that is the correct result.

Hi Helen,

Thanks for the repetitive answer.
OK, thats correct and the goal fo the screen in the thickbox.
Thats was my questin, why many customer will see a list of categories in
the box and add the category via checkbox, but this is now my part and I
add this via plugin. My question was, maybe is the first idea for 3.5, not
the goal for the end of the hierarchical taxonomies in the thickbox.

Best

It's not using Thickbox :) I think this is important to recognize because
Thickbox meant loading an iframe, which the new media modal is not. It's
also an outdated, unmaintained script.

I guess having taxonomy terms appear in the new modal with a default UI is
new. I thought it did the same thing previously if you had a taxonomy for
attachments, but looks like not. In any case, you are welcome to come up
with other ideas that work as a default if you like, although obviously
this will not change for 3.5. If you or your users find the input in the
modal to be confusing, you can turn it off quite easily and even replace it
with your own UI if you'd like.

Not Thikcbox; nice; thats new for me, but important. Now I can step to this
soluiton on different free plugins, there use this thickbox solution in
backend.

UI: current is the most requirement, that the people will see the
hierarchical taxonomie and check the checkbox; for tags is the current UI
fine and very seldom I add a tree. Give it also changes on this part to add
tree inside the box of taxonomies,was not so easy before 3.5.

Ideas, Discussion:
I read all stuff about WP, I work, develop and use WP sind 0.7*. But the
time and my bad english is handycap for this topic.

Just a quickie.
Modal = lightbox = thickbox = dialog (depending on where in the world you are)
In the same way not all tissues are kleenex; and not all music players are iPods...` lets cut the non-americans some slack for not using our terminology :)

Seriously? I said that it was important to note because of the difference
it makes *in terms of development*. I thought that was pretty clear. My own
parents don't speak English as a first language; one of them doesn't live
in the US and thus barely speaks it at all and most certainly does not
write in it. I do everything I can to find a way to understand the actual
intent of communication, because it's not the other party's fault that the
common language is (largely American) English, and I appreciate that I am
at an advantage because it is my first language. What I don't appreciate is
the assumption that I'm repeating something just to be a difficult pedant.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Searching for themes by name
Message-ID: <50C2D772.70906@wordshell.net>


On WP Planet, I noticed two interesting-looking new themes - Poloray and 
Noteworthy.

I went into my test WP installation, and searched for them by name. "No 
themes match your request". My options to search are by Tag, Author, 
Keyword. Neither Tag nor Keyword appear to allow to search by name.

Is this just the authors making a mistake by not putting their theme 
name as a tag? Is it documented somewhere that that is compulsory? Or am 
I missing something (am I the first person to try searching for a theme 
by name???) Is not being able to search for a theme by name a feature or 
a bug - should I file it?

It was a bug that only affected some themes. It is now fixed.

	but only active on next page load after activation?
Message-ID: <CAKiTgkbw+ZNQHpjW4DF9WZau=hrDApjOWGHeZfeiLqepSTH08g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm currently running into a small problem with user roles and custom
capabilities.
I've written a demo plugin that shows the issue (on both WP 3.4 and
trunk): https://gist.github.com/4242194

To reproduce:
- Go to "Plugins" in the admin menu.
- Activate test "Menu Cap Test" plugin
- You will see the yellow "Plugin activated." admin notice at the top.
- BUT: You will not see the "MCT plugin" entry at the bottom of the admin menu!
You will only see that entry after loading any other page, e.g. by
clicking any entry in the admin menu.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks!
Tobias

P.S. You will only be able to observe this on the very first
activation of the plugin, as the cap is already added on subsequent
activations. Thus, when testing, the cap should be removed again
before activating the plugin.

Message-ID: <50C470AD.9010400@gmail.com>

Hello,

I was wondering if its possible to use the permalink settings in plugins 
instead of them using default non permalink urls.

For example i'm using the plugin flickr photostream, its written by 
someone else, but I would like to know for my own plugins and to patch 
this one to create nicer permalinks instead of 
http://www.domain.co.uk/?flickrps=2 to go forward and back between pages.

Thanks
Daniel.

Hey hackers,

I just posted a question on the WP Answers Stack Exchange, and figured
that it's probably worth asking here too:

Err... Just include wp-load.php?

The query doesn't run until the wp() function is called, and that
happens in wp-blog-header.php, not in wp-load.php. So, just including
wp-load.php doesn't run the main query. Or parse the query vars, or
much of anything else.

I've just realised that my question is inaccurate, so I've removed it
from WP Answers. There are a few issues to correct, but it's better
discussed somewhere else.

Sorry for the noise!

Heh, yeah, I screwed up while reading the code and got confused. There
are a few things done in wp-load.php that don't make sense if WP is
embedded inside another application (e.g. magic quote adding).

Hi,

I have investigated this some more now.

> before activating the plugin.

That's actually only partially true. The real issue is that
WP_Role->add_cap() and WP_Role->remove_cap() do not refresh the
current set of capabilities that a user has, i.e. WP_User->allcaps for
the $current_user is not updated.
I have created another demo plugin that illustrates this:
https://gist.github.com/4252214

As you can see in the output of the plugin, it takes a
WP_User->get_role_caps() for the capability to be usable in the same
page load that added the cap. Without this, the capability would only
be usable on the next page load, as WP_User->allcaps is then created
freshly from the user meta.

Should we maybe update the current set of capabilities of a WP_User,
when caps are added/removed to/from a WP_Role?

Another plugin that shows the same behavior as described in my initial
mail is Justin Tadlock's "Members" plugin, by the way. After
activating the plugin, it takes another page load to actually see the
admin menu entries. The core of the issue is the same in that plugin.

Kind Regards,
Tobias

	requires version X
Message-ID: <CAFtaa=Tec8cjk9Wg_1_pCe8_zrJAE_L_9KvxvZew=O0teTDtwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey there,
is there any way to figure out since which version a script is included in
WordPress Core?

There is a list of all scripts included, but it does not contain an 'since'
[1]

Wanted to use 'farbtastic' as fallback for the new color picker from 3.5.
In trac there are already tickets from 2008 about it - when trying to
enqueue it I only got it working 3.2 and newer.

wp_enqueue_style( 'farbtastic' );
> wp_enqueue_script( 'farbtastic' );



Furthermore, not exactly the same topic:
There is no "theme requires version X and is compatible up to version Y" on
WordPress.org, is it? Wanted to install some themes featuring post
thumbnail on 3.0 to test my plugin. First idea: 2012. It broke because of
an missing multiuser function.
Is this a bug which should be reported and/or patched? I didn't do so
because the theme no where claims to be compatible down to 3.0.

Best regards, hope you all get some sleep before 3.5 is released

The version pages in the Codex tell you which script versions shipped with
which release.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3

http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.4

http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5

and so on.

Hope that helps,

Drew

Thanks! Wrong report about farbtastic not being available in 3.1 I think.
Have to test 3.0 and 3.1 again tomorrow.

Still think it would be nice to have a 4th column called 'since' in the
default scripts list. Maybe I will add it.

If you're testing with multiple versions, you might find Whippet useful:

   https://github.com/dxw/whippet

See the --wp-version option.

Cheers,

Harry

Thanks Harry, I will take a look at it. I have 5 different WP installations
for testing purposes atm ;)

That leaves my other question open: How to determine the compatibility of a
WordPress theme with older WordPress versions? Why is there no
"compatibility vote" like for plugins on WordPress.org?

 querystring based URL
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2W4vDN+VeYStSEXaqBdp2ShCgJ_yDrQPRVAADJjkG62w@mail.gmail.com>

The following URL seems to work for cats and tags only.

yoursite.com?cat=2&tag=bread1+bread2

what if you wanted to get into custom taxonomy and terms and do
something similar?

is there an equivalent to something like the following?

yoursite.com?taxonomy=food&tag=bread1+bread2

Thank you.

Yes! I believe so, it looks like just what I am after, I'll need to do a 
bit more investigating but I feel have been put on the right path now, 
so thanks very much for this!

Message-ID: <CABZq-sg+eM5j5vWkKrVt=KLnZw93s9QEW94LmnweKBVCbm4j-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

I'm trying to redirect urls based on regex compatible with unicode
characters. It looks something like this:

add_rewrite_rule(
            '^analytics/([\p{L}\p{N}\_]*)/?$',
    'index.php?analytics=$matches[1]',
    'top'
);


However, this still doesn't work with unicode characters as I need to pass
a regular expression modifier 'u' with it. Any idea how I can do that?

Sure. You can't. The regular expression used for rewrite rules doesn't
contain the u modifier, and there is no option to add it.

See class-wp.php, around line 205-ish.

BTW, unicode characters are not valid in URLs anyway. According to the
RFC (1738), only ASCII characters are allowed in URLs. Anything else
must be percent encoded.

See http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1738.html

Or a better explanation here:

I understand that. Browser always percent-encodes the URLs. This URL goes
to the regex engine (PCRE) as an ASCII string. This is the exact reason why
I need the 'u' modifier - to tell PCRE that the supplied string must be
treated as a Unicode string.

That kinda doesn't make any sense. You can't have a unicode string
there, because it will be percent encoded. So matching against unicode
won't work anyway.

We are using urldecode() before matching in class-wp.php, so its not
percent encoded.

I was wondering if someone could help me a little more with this, having 
difficulty implementing this.

I managed to find this via google, and seemed fairly easy to do, but am 
not getting the results I was expecting.
http://gabrielharper.com/blog/2012/09/wordpress-custom-urls-for-plugins/

Instead of http://www.domain.co.uk/?flickrps=2 I would like the urls to 
be something similar to http://www.domain.co.uk/page/2

I understand this is taken by WordPress but just after something like 
this, maybe photo would be better perhaps.

Umm, doesn't appear to be the case, because the code in class-wp.php
actually tries it both ways.

Line 204-205:

if ( preg_match("#^$match#", $request_match, $matches) ||
	preg_match("#^$match#", urldecode($request_match), $matches) ) {

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adding edit,
	umapprove and mark as spam in comments area
Message-ID: <CAJ5Hi2h2h4RJ4EOMfjexf8fX_Tbg-N4MhC53Ej0-BP7XSUA0qg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

Just wondering, does anyone here know how I can add "edit", "mark as spam"
and "umapprove" links in the comment loop in my wordpress theme?

Also if it not that hard I would like the "mark as spam" and "umapprove"
links to be ajax or at the very lease have it so it does it job then take
me back to the page that I was on.
 Regards,
Daniel Fenn

Non-percent-encoded URL is being passed in the second preg_match, and
there's an OR operator, so either preg_match can make the condition true.
That is what I meant.

Sorry, one more thing. If you change the code to :

if ( preg_match("#^$match#", $request_match, $matches) ||
        preg_match("#^$match#u", urldecode($request_match), $matches) ) {

unicode URLs start working (notice the 'u' modifier).

Right, but there is no way to do that without hacking core. There's no
option for that.

And it's not necessary anyway, because the first preg_match is getting
the URL undecoded, and so you can match against the actual URL, with
percents and all, there.

The problem with this is, I want to catch all letters (\p{L}) and all
numbers (\p{N}) from all languages. There's no way of doing that without
using *UTF8 verb, or a 'u' modifier. So changing the question, does it look
like something which can be included in future versions of wordpress since
Unicode URLs are getting more popular?

It sounds to me like you're complicating things by trying to be overly
strict with your URL regex. Why not use a more lenient regex in the
URL such as  '^analytics/([^/]+)/?$' and then move your Unicode logic
into PHP?

That should work, but its not a fix, just a workaround.

Message-ID: <CAPdLKqc6r9HKyE9E6fodb9b8--1ny6iLboM=G41BtuhA+ZesFQ@mail.gmail.com>

I recently tried passing 'fields' => 'user_email' in the arguments array
for get_users(). Instead of returning user email addresses as expected, the
call returned user IDs.

var_dump( get_users( array( 'fields' => 'user_email' ) ) );

outputs:

array(3) { [0]=> string(2) "10" [1]=> string(1) "9" [2]=> string(1) "1" }

According to the Codex, this should be an array of user
emails<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_users#Example_for_Array_of_Values_when_single_Field_specified>
.

Is this a bug? Can anyone reproduce? (I found nothing related in Trac.) Or
am I doing something wrong?

Note, if I make 'fields' an array, I get an array of objects that *do*
consist of user_email values:

var_dump( get_users( array( 'fields' => array( 'user_email' ) ) ) );

outputs:

array(3) { [0]=> object(stdClass)#620 (1) { ["user_email"]=> string(22) "
testeditor at example.com" } [1]=> object(stdClass)#621 (1) { ["user_email"]=>
string(26) "testsubscriber at example.com" } [2]=> object(stdClass)#622 (1) {
["user_email"]=> string(20) "chip at chipbennett.net" } }

Just doing a sanity check before submitting a bug report, and/or updating
the Codex.

Thanks,

Looking at the code for WP_User_Query::prepare_query() 

The 'fields' arg needs to be an array, to achieve what you want.

get_users( array( 'fields' => array( 'user_email' ) ) )

If it is not an array, and not the string 'all', then it queries for ID.

Thanks, Matt. So it'll be a Codex update, then.

And #facepalm to me, for not looking in source before asking. :)

I do however see no reason that we couldn't modify that code, to do what many may think it should. 

If it isn't an array, and it isn't the string 'all', then why not cast it to an array?  Or at least if it is a whitelisted field, cast it to an array.  I cannot see where anyone using it is actually benefiting from the fact that if it is not an array or not 'all' that it falls back to the ID. But I could be missing some history here...

I'd be willing to write/submit a patch, if others think it would be useful?

Hello - I've seen a good tutorial on this - couldn't find it, but found
these two:

http://wp.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/23/10-wordpress-comments-hacks/#more-8348
http://new2wp.com/snippet/spam-delete-links-comments-frontend/

Not Ajax, though..

Subject: [wp-hackers] Issue with embedding video links?
Message-ID: <50CB5882.1040009@elfden.co.uk>

I saw this posted on a blog I frequent and followed up with them about 
it.
http://www.geeksaresexy.net/2012/12/13/wordpress-3-5-removes-embed-code-from-posts/#dsq-content

Then I did a few tests on WordPress 3.5, with theme - Twenty Eleven, 
and with all other plugins deactivated.

I used the embed code from Youtube:

<iframe width="560" height="315" 
src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cBlRbrB_Gnc" frameborder="0" 
allowfullscreen></iframe>

along with some text before and after in a scheduled post.

When it publishes the embed code gets removed, including the link to 
the video.

I know that using a standard link will work, but should this be 
getting removed, or is it a bug?

Confirmed, I can reproduce this on a localhost install. Schedule the
post, and it gets cleaned when it posts.

If I disable kses' filters by commenting out the unfiltered_html check
in kses_init(), then it doesn't happen and the post posts fine.

So what I think is going on is that in the publish action, the kses
filters are being added. This is because the "current user" is the
cron process, and that call is not authenticated, so the
unfiltered_html cap does not apply, so it's filtered.

Note that this only happens when using code that triggers the filter,
like the iframe or object or embed or anything like that. If you use
the normal oEmbed process (just paste in the Youtube link on a line by
itself), then the publishing works fine.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Clickable links filter on FTP hostnames
Message-ID: <50CB6C84.7050200@wordshell.net>

There's a default filter in WordPress (which eventually is found in the 
function _make_web_ftp_clickable_cb in wp-includes/formatting.php), 
which takes anything matching "<space>ftp.(the rest)" and turns it into 
a hyperlink beginning with http://

This seems very wrong. It was wrong for me. It turned a line in which I 
was listing an FTP server:

Host: ftp.example.com

into this which gives an HTTP link and hence is wrong and/or gibberish:

Host: <a href="http://ftp.example.com" 
rel="nofollow">http://ftp.example.com</a>

I can't think of why you'd want, by default, to add http:// to detected 
hostnames beginning with "ftp." . But before I file a bug in Trac, does 
anyone know why that bit of code is in there (and on by default)? Am I 
missing something?

Funnily enough, when I viewed your email in GMail, it did exactly the
same thing to your "ftp.example.com", in exactly the same way (adding
http:// to it and making it a link).

I don't know if you'd call this a bug, but it may be unexpected.
However, a large number of FTP sites are indeed webservers nowadays
too. Kinda makes sense.

Hi guys, is there a hook or something to interact with the single post

You could remove the filter, then add your own custom without the ftp
parsing.

Ive never seen people link to ftp via blogs ftp://etc

Message-ID: <CAEamYWQbiMRuRSGafgysi1sWmQw-PSbJ5OW_gC8xr1gtNhOptA@mail.gmail.com>

Not even sure how to form that subject line, hence I'm having a heckuva
time searching for the answer that I need.

What I'm trying to do is this: when I publish a post, I'd like to search
the post title for tags I've already added to said post. Basically, I'm
replacing that tag with a hashtag version for publishing to a tweet.

The trouble is that, even though I've added tags to a post, unless the post
has already been saved once (and hence had the tags added to the database),
they don't get picked up when executing the transition_post_status hook.

I'm assuming that this is a priority issue, as the tags get saved in one
step and I have to try to slot myself in behind them. But I've set the
priority to 20 and still no change.

Is what I'm trying to do possible in one saving operation?

Hi Guys,

Whats the best way to learn the wordpress way of doing things and 
getting support when get stuck, as getting limited to no help via this 
mailing list is there something else or another way I should be going 
about this, how did you all get to where you are today and learn the ins 
and outs of wordpress and how to do things within it and its functions.

I've tried stack exchange generally get no answers there either, and 
have also tried the wordpress support forums, sadly the same there too, 
generally get no meaningful answers.

Thanks
Daniel.

The #wordpress channel on the freenode IRC is good too. The support there
is "live", but can sometimes take a while to get a response.

I'd start with tutorials. Check the comments on any tutorial before
you start -- did it work for most folks? And check the date.  If it's
more than a year old things have probably changed.  Have real projects
you want to accomplish, be willing to be flexible about them, and find
tutorials where you learn to do things.  As you're working, go check
the codex for the things you're learning.  You need to learn your way
around the codex as it's the "user manual". It'll also clue you in
when a tutorial isn't doing something the 'right' way, which plenty
don't.  If the codex says "don't do this" and the tutorial says do, go
find another tutorial.

Use the Wordpress forums for specific questions that crop up, but the
last year or so responses have dropped off a cliff when I ask
something there. It may be because I'm asking more advanced questions,
rather than that the forums have changed.  I'm honestly not sure.

Daniel,

When I started several years ago, I found one of the easiest ways to learn
"the WordPress way" was to help other people in the support forums. I know,
it sounds kinda dumb, learn WordPress by helping people learn WordPress ...
but it works. Usually the biggest problem when getting into something like
WordPress is not knowing which questions to ask. And that's the beauty of
answering support questions in #wordpress (IRC) or in the support forums ?
other people ask the questions, you find the answers. And as somebody else
mentioned, the place to *find* the answers is http://codex.wordpress.org .
Answer some questions and read other people's answers it's a great way to
learn.

When I started, the first thing I sought to learn was the WordPress lingo..
for example the loop, permalinks, and template tags. Using those types of
terms will better your understanding of WordPress customization so that
when you have a question, you can be very specific... and chances are your
question has already been answered elsewhere.

There's a good book called "Digging into WordPress" that breaks down the
basics, and you can decide where to go from there.

http://digwp.com/

It really clarified a lot of questions I had at first.

This list is a good resource for more advanced questions (and/or to
just kick back and listen).

I like WP stack site:

<http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/>

... though, never asked a question there.

Looking through source files helps (themes, WP core).

I created a few bookmarklets to help me search the codex and WP site:

<http://sandbox.hulse.me/scripts/bookmarklets/wordpress.html>

Also, it helps to know PHP in general. Are you also looking for PHP
tips and resources? Having a solid understanding of PHP will
definitely make life easier for when it comes to WP.

Hths,

Cheers,

Aero,

With the caveat that I'm only seven months into developing with WordPress,
I started with the database diagram (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description) in addition to following
the load code through starting at the root index.php.  I spent a lot of
time reading stack exchange and the WordPress forums.  If a question was
asked on either that I didn't know the answer to I'd work through it on our
dev server.  Mostly, I built a few WordPress sites and referred to
"official" good code like the starter themes whenever I was unsure of best
practices.  Now, when I run into a function that I haven't seen before, I
reference the codex.

This was the most useful post I ever came across, although it was pretty
over my head the first time I read it despite what I thought was a pretty
good understanding of ajax:
http://www.garyc40.com/2010/03/5-tips-for-using-ajax-in-wordpress/

I recently saw this really useful presentation by Andrew Nacin about
queries that was referenced in a discussion about query_posts():
http://wordpress.tv/2012/06/15/andrew-nacin-wp_query/

Best of luck.

You can integrate WordPress search into your browser's search bar:

http://mycroft.mozdev.org/search-engines.html?name=wordpress

The 2nd one (wordpress support) works best IMO. Pretty handy when you 
want to look up a WP function.

Hey guys,

Thankyou for the answers. I've taken a look at the link provided by Patty
and that is really close to what I am after. What I ended up doing is
taking the code from that blog and extending it so that it almost like ajax
but it not.

For those who are wondering what I ended up with (and I'm still working on
it) this is what I got:


function comment_mod_link($id) {
  if (current_user_can('edit_posts')) {
    $del_nonce = esc_html('_wpnonce=' .
wp_create_nonce("delete-comment_$id"));
    $approve_nonce = esc_html('_wpnonce=' .
wp_create_nonce("approve-comment_$id"));
    $_wp_original_http_referer = '_wp_original_http_referer=' .
apply_filters('the_permalink', get_permalink());
    echo '<li class="edit-icon"><a
href="'.admin_url("comment.php?action=editcomment&amp;c=$id&amp;$_wp_original_http_referer").'"></a></li>
';
    echo '<li class="wp-delete-icon"><a
href="'.admin_url("comment.php?action=trashcomment&amp;c=$id&amp;$del_nonce&amp;$_wp_original_http_referer").'"></a></li>
';
    echo '<li class="wp-info-icon"><a
href="'.admin_url("comment.php?action=spamcomment&amp;c=$id&amp;$del_nonce&amp;$_wp_original_http_referer").'"></a></li>';
  }
}

Now all I do is need to figure out how to show comments that are waiting to
be approved, marked as spam and deleted to current_user_can('edit_posts')
so that all of that can be managed without going to wp-admin.

Chris,

While that would have done the job, I wanted to try something different and
do some coding myself. And by doing that one can learn more about what
going on inside wordpress.

Regards,
Daniel Fenn

Well that is one way of learning, things are not always explained that well.

I ended up reading alot on this mailing list, googling and taking a look at
what others has done and how they did things.

Like others said knowing php in general will help a lot.

http://au.php.net/docs.php,
http://au1.php.net/manual/en/faq.mailinglist.php and
http://au1.php.net/manual/en/index.php comes to mind.

Stack exchange is great for finding solutions or asking questions. This list is usually more theoretical - has anyone considered trying x - than about sharing code snippets.

Thanks. That's my short-term work-round, but I thought it counted as 
bug, as I can think of no reason why WordPress would want to auto-detect 
ftp. hostnames and turn them *all* into http:// links. (If anything, it 
would want to turn them into ftp:// links as the default case if it must 
link-ify them).
> Ive never seen people link to ftp via blogs ftp://etc
It is a web-hosting website (www.simbahosting.co.uk). We want to advise 
people of the FTP server to use. Having WordPress turn our advice of an 
FTP host name into an erroneous HTTP link is definitely unhelpful! (In 
this case it was via an email that was being HTML-ified via the "WP 
Better Emails" plugin).

I've tried using the codex, but that's only good when you know what 
functions you need to use to get to where your wanting to go.

Like I've written one plugin so far and used the settings api, and have 
been told my implementation of it is heavily bloated, but unsure how 
else to implement this, have used the validation stuff and everything it 
can do, I think its just bloated in general perhaps ?

Thanks for the reply though.

Yeah I know php thats not the issue, stuck trying to work out how to use 
the wordpress functions to do what I am trying to do, which at the 
moment is how to make nice seo friendly urls in a plugin, so i don't get 
the question marks in the url would like the urls to be uniform through 
out my whole site.

I've tried to google things that I need/want to do with my site and 
writing my own plugins, and patching others plugins to add to them what 
I would like them to do.  But its hard to find things that I am wanting 
to do which is why I end up resorting to posting here, and posting on 
stack exchange.

Thanks for the reply/response though.

I can understand how that is good and helps you learn, but at the same 
time its hard to get focussed on other peoples questions that may not 
have anything to do with your problems or things you wish to do, and 
therefore then hard to get anything done.

I've bookmarked the links that you mention though thank you very much 
for those.

Doing that is very time consuming and looses/shifts focus on doing 
something that someone may need to do, and can significantly lengthen 
development time on what it is your working on.

I know what questions to ask, and I have been able to find somethings 
about what I am trying to do but have had very limited success, I am 
just wanting to have some nice seo friendly urls in a plugin instead of 
the ugly ones with question marks in them, would like my urls to be all 
nice and clean throughout my site.

Counterexample: Thunderbird linked it to ftp://ftp.example.com/ so
there's definitely software that does this.

I'd be against something like that in core (seems a little iffy to guess
a protocol based on the name), but you should be able to do it yourself
by filtering the autolinking functionality.

Hi Daniel,

The absolute best way to learn WordPress is to spend time with the
resources that have been mentioned here. It sounds like you have done some
of that, but still haven't found the particular answer you are looking for
regarding the URLs generated by the Flikr plugin.

I came to WordPress about two years ago after not programming for probably
10 to 12 years. I learned PHP through the process of learning WordPress. I
started by reading a basic tutorial about how to build a theme. Then I
started reading about more advanced topics such as custom meta boxes,
custom post types, plugins, etc. I spent a lot of time with tutorials,
poring over functions in the codex (whether I needed them at that moment or
not) and just trial and error. I think that is the best way to learn
besides taking a class or reading a book such as Digging Into Wordpress
(which my brother-in-law is reading and enjoying).

Of course, your need is pretty specific. Could you share links to the
StackExchange questions you have posted? Also, I saw one of your previous
questions on this list in which you said you followed a tutorial but
weren't getting the results you expected. It would be helpful if you would
show the code you used (perhaps in a StackExchange question) so others on
the list could look over it.

The way I learned wp as a programmer (probably 5 years ago) was by
watching it work.  I loaded it up in a debugger (I use Komodo, but there
are a million choices), and just walked through the code.  Not line by
line, but more function by function, skipping over things at the start,
then delving into functions when I wanted to know more.  Saw how the
functions are loaded, how the query is parsed, how the loop is executed,
how the database is accessed, how output is generated, etc., and not just
theoretically, but in code as it went by.

It's a pretty hard-core way of doing it, but for me to this day, nothing
is better than setting a breakpoint at something I don't understand, and
walking through it.

As for getting support, I gave up on the WP support forum years ago.  You
get three results: 1) no response whatsoever, 2) some idiot who doesn?t
read your question but simply points you to the codex, or 3) a wrong
(usually stale) answer.  Google is best.  There are thousands of people
who figure something out and then blog about it, or you get results in
places like StackOverflow or other forums that will point you in the right
direction.  Then I head back into the code (see above) with the bread
crumbs I got from Google as a guide.

HTH,
Chris

I have that book, along with about 15 others if I am perfectly honest, 
and read through most of them but some have out of date information in 
them I have since found but no worries.

I have written a plugin and would like to write more of them, have also 
coded a theme too but for my own personal use, my design skills are

I have tried this and whereas I have managed to find bits here and there 
how to do things, I have generally struggled and struggled to find what 
I have been after as sometimes the information is there but its 
difficult to find when you dont know what to search for, or when you 
have found something generally hit a stumbling block trying to implement 
which is where I am now, I have posted on both wordpress stackexchange 
and stackoverflow.

Aero,

If I understand your question, it sounds like you want to know how to use
rewrite rules to rewrite urls in a plugin; here's a tutorial that might
help: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/wordpress-url-rewrite/

Cheers,

 -- Peter

Hey guys and gals,

Anyone know of a good way to find out what JS function is responsible for a certain behavior other than going through the JS files and trying to guess? I'm trying to patch up some JS bugs on Wordpress and it seems a bit trickier than PHP patching. Also, whatever I change doesn't seem to be reflected when I reload so I'm guessing some caching kicks in (other than my browser's which should be disabled). Any ideas how to get around that? Thanks!

~Dobri

Hi there,

I don't know if you tried this but if you got firefox installed, you may
want to look at firebug[1].

Also if you think that there may be some caching going on, I would try
pressing Ctrl F5 to do a force refresh..

Chrome dev tools are fantastic for this as well - better than Firebug, I'd say. Both will give you the line number in the script where the failure occurred, and at least Chrome allows you to click on that to be taken directly to the error.

Well since you asked, there's a brand-new Codex article for just such a
thing.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors

It has directions for identifying JavaScript errors in the top 5 browsers.

Also, make sure you have SCRIPT_DEBUG[1] enabled, especially if you are

Thanks for that, looks like could be what am after, I wont be able to 
test it until late this evening or tomorrow.

Also that page looks like to be a pretty resource for testing rewrite

Ah, yes! That's exactly what I needed, I did not realize there is a separate debug setting precisely for JS debugging. That article also looks interesting... Thanks a lot, I'll make sure to look into it more today.

Subject: [wp-hackers] what URL does the Dashboard's update button link to?
Message-ID: <CAHERW=1Ud87D37yEAv=b7iEHXiqrdM4avXjNV0EnxDy=ajdbmQ@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to diagrammatically trigger the process which runs when
an admin clicks on the blue "update" button on the dashboard.

I'm looking for something like

.... wp-admin/post.php?post=5095&action=publish
.... wp-admin/post.php?post=5095&action=submit_publish something like that.

I assume that the link I'm looking for would trigger the same process
which takes place upon  an update button click on the admin dashboard.

The plan is to use the define('WP_USE_THEMES', false); in a standalone
PHP  and run that link in a loop. ( The particular theme I'm working
with fixes certain problems that I encounter on my programmatically
migrated posts upon  a simple update. Since I got to many to fix, thus
to many to click on the update button manually. )

Back in the old days, you would be able to go to the view source, find
that button, trace it to its href .
Then you could run that href in a loop changing the postid's at each
iteration and viola, all the posts referred  in the loop would have
been updated - the same way a manual mouse click would do. Now, the
click events are attached thru javascript, that's no longer the case.

Since I cannot see the href and a server level redirect takes place
thru the operation, it's quite hard to get to it.

I'm not sure if there is a URL or if it's triggered through a POST event.
In any case you could always include wp_load and just call the update
function directly, i believe the function name is wp_upgrade()

Try to cause WordPress to wp_die(var_dump($_POST)); when a post is updated and check what the parameters passed to the post.php/edit.php page are when stuff gets published/edited/created/whatever.(I've posted some code below) Then you can just imitate those POST parameters to update pages programatically. Once you've played around with it enough, remove the code that kills wordpress and see if your imitation works. If there is some defense against this kind of behavior it might not work but at least it's worth a shot. And yes, I do realize it's not elegant at all.

function kill_it($new_status, $old_status, $post)
{
	//prevent from dying when attempting to create a new page
	if('new' != $old_status)
	{
		wp_die(var_dump($_POST));
	}
}

add_action('transition_post_status', 'kill_it', 10, 3);

Another solution might be to create a plugin that has its own custom page that takes GET/POST parameters and (sanitizes!) and uses those to create/edit pages through the wp_update_post() and wp_insert_post() functions. That would be a dash more elegant. I hope I helped at least a bit.

Thank you Dobri, but this would by pass the theme's hooks.
Perhaps I wasn't clear in my original post. Here, I'm NOT trying to
update the posts programmatically.
Those posts ( and they are 16k in count ) were all inserted into
wp_posts thru a migration routine that I wrote.
Once the routine finishes, I get to populate an empty wp_posts,
post_meta, term_taxonomy, terms, term_relationships and  comments with
all the content I want. Then I browse the site. Everything is alright
except some of the thumbnail images. some images show dithered, and
some shows just wrong - instead of showing the first image in the
post, it shows the last image. This feature is part of the theme I'm
working with. But whatever the problem is with those thumbs, they
simply get automatically fixed as soon as I open one of those posts
and hit the blue update button. Then the same post which used to show
the dithered image or the last image gets automatically fixed once and
for all.

It is because this reason why I wanted to "simulate" the click even on
that update.

If I adopt the actoin hooks or use wp_update_post etc, this does not
solve the problem.

I think there are a bunch of hooks that this theme registered and they
all kick in at the time of a manual update. See what I mean?

Can you suggest a away to stop the redirect before it ends up with
something like /wp-admin/post.php?post=3223&action=edit&message=1

If I could stop the location redirect, I think I should be able to see
the WordPress URL that's triggered upon clicking on the update button
on the dashboard.

Hi Haluk,

I'm sorry if I misunderstood you. If I got your idea right this time, how 
about you go through all pages/posts (perhaps doing some simple checks to 
sift through them) and publish them one by one? That really wouldn't be 
something you want to be doing regularly but if you have a process that does 
that once and you prevent the server from timing off, sure, why not. You can 
use the get_posts() or get_pages() functions to get a list of all of them 
(I'm not sure about that but I'm guessing that leaving that number of posts 
empty should default to no limit, as in all of the pages/posts so far). Then 
just do a loop that goes through the list of returned posts/pages and uses 
wp_publish_post($post->ID) to publish each one. You might have to do a 
wp_update_post() if that doesn't work since the codex specifically says 
"This function does not do anything except transition the post status." I 
hope this helps.

Did you try disabling JS in your browser to see what happens? WP should
work without JS, and if it's not there then you'll probably be able to
figure out what the fallback solution is and what gets passed in _POST etc.

That said, you should also try out a solution using wp_insert_post()
(/wp-includes/post.php around line 2700) as it will fire most of the post
saving hooks that your theme is likely to use, and avoids all the noise
you'll create by loading the actual post editing page from inside your
code.

Message-ID: <50D1FF01.608@slingshot.co.nz>

Hi all,

I have a situation where I converted from one shopping cart
to another.

As a result, the attachment URLs ( which I can see via the
media library via the File URL field) need changing. There
are more than 150 products, so I don't want to do it manually
if I can helpit. As a trial run, I tried changing the GUID of an
attachment in the attachment's post entry in the database.
But this has no effect, the File URL in the media library for
that item has stayed the same.

So, where in the database is the attachment's URL held?

Alternatively, is there an easier way to bulk change
File URLs for attachment ( featured image ) media?

thanks in advance,

	pages
Message-ID: <D0BB7D82-651E-49AF-B12E-B5E4B4A3746F@fklein.info>

Hello everybody,

I'm working on a website with a custom post type for press releases, that has a an archive template (archive-press-releases.php) which lists all the press releases. This archive has been added to my custom menu as a simple link pointing to http://www.mysite.com/press-releases/. It is placed in the second level, under a parent page called "Press" with two other sibling elements.

I have implemented a wp_nav_menu with a custom walker that uses the current, ancestor and parent CSS classes to figure out which pages are under the parent page "Press" in the menu structure in order to generate a secondary menu.

This works perfectly on the first page of the press releases listing, but once I browse the archives, for example http://www.mysite.com/press-releases/2011/ or the second page (http://www.mysite.com/press-releases/page/2/), the wp_nav_menu doesn't output the current, ancestor and parent CSS classes anymore, so my custom walker stops working and the secondary menu disappears. The menu and the walker work correctly on the two sibling menu elements, which are simple pages.

Does anybody have experience with this or a similar case?

Thanks in advance for your responses, regards,
Fr?nk

Thank you guys.
I should have thought of this, but the link I was hoping was not query
based. It was silly of me to think of it that way to begin with. All
the image, obviously is posted to the post.php page as a method=post
as opposed to method=get. Of course.

So that route would yield me no fruitful results.

The right question I should have probably asked was if I could get a
list of all the hooked functions at the time of an update? I don't
know how I could get a hold of such a function list?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Javascript bind event for 3.5's new uploader?
Message-ID: <CAFnKAk3YCggN=kBprnDtPWTL3BXN0AXQ8uVc=ZwNSY+F1K2ZYg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

In previous versions of Wordpress, it was fairly simple to add
Javascript on a hook for the iframe of the upload/media gallery.
Currently, 3.5 uses a much faster Backbone.js, and templating in
wp-includes/media-template.php, instead of iframe.

I'm trying to add an action when the uploader is displayed, but I
can't seem to call the .on or .bind from external code. The relevant
caller is in media-views.js:1965-1983:
        open: function() {
            var $el = this.$el,
            options = this.options;

            if ($el.is(':visible'))
                return this;

            if (!this.views.attached)
                this.attach();

            // If the `freeze` option is set, record the window's
scroll position.
            if (options.freeze) {
                this._freeze = {
                    scrollTop: $(window).scrollTop()
                };
            }

            $el.show().focus();
            return this.propagate('open');
        },

When I break on the last line, then enter at the console
"this.on('open',function(){alert('hi')});" it works. Code will be run
whenever the dialog opens.
Unfortunately, it seems this can't be added from external code.
wp.media.editor.on, wp.media.editor.bind, and others will not work.

Best regards
Luke

Hi Luke,

wp.media.editor is used to manage instances of editor-specific media managers. If you're looking to trigger an event when opening the default media modal, you'll want to grab a reference to the media manager by calling wp.media.editor.add('content'). We're calling "add" here instead of "get" to make sure the modal exists, because "get" may return undefined (and don't worry, "add" only creates the instance once). You can then call the .on method on that object and your code will run just fine.

For example:

var media = wp.media.editor.add('content');
media.on( 'open', function() {
console.log( 'Opening the modal?' );
});

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Koop

I haven't tested this, but you might want to give it a shot:

$fooBarQuery[ 'tax_query' ] = array(
     array(
         'taxonomy'    => 'category',
         'terms'        => 'foo',
         'field'        => 'slug',
     ),
     array(
         'taxonomy'    => 'category',
         'terms'        => 'bar',
         'field'        => 'slug',
     ),
     'relation'        => 'OR'
);
$fooBarPosts = get_posts( $fooBarQuery );

There may be a more elegant way to do it, but I'm not seeing it from a 
quick glance at the Codex. If not, then you'd need to use 
$wpdb->get_results() with a custom query.

Also, check out

Pass the 'foo' and 'bar' category $id values as an array to the
`category__in` parameter:

$args = array( 'category__in' => array( 1, 2 ) );

$custom_query = new WP_Query( $args );

p.s. avoid query_posts() here. Use a new instance of WP_Query() if you're
creating a secondary loop, or filter the main $query via pre_get_posts, if
you're modifying the main query.

Ignore the previous answers by Ian and Chip, I think they missed the
"AND" part of the question.

The correct answer is to add an operator to your array.

$myquery['tax_query'] = array(
    array(
        'taxonomy' => 'category',
        'terms' => array('foo', 'bar'),
        'field' => 'slug',
        'operator' => 'AND',
    ),
);

You may also want to add 'include_children' => false, if you don't
want the category searcher to pick up posts that are in child
categories of foo and bar as well.

Note that there is a shortcut version of this called category__and,
which accepts the ID values of the categories only.

You're right, Otto. That's what I get for answering questions at 11:30 at
night. :)

Just change my answer to use 'category__and', instead of 'category__in'.
The funny thing is, I almost added that as an addendum to say,
"category__in will give you foo OR bar, and category__and will give you foo
AND bar."

Thanks Koop. In some cases the 'content' has to be another id,
whatever the id of the editor's textarea is, and it works! :)

Thank you all.

Otto, you must have recognized the original foo/bar snippet. That was
from your page.
It might be a good idea to add the operator option "ADD" for the rest
of us - somewhere around where you just talk about the "NOT IN"
operator option.

The AND operator was added after I wrote that, I think. IN is the
default, NOT IN is also valid.

Note, the AND operator is *exceedingly* slow and should generally be
avoided, if possible. The SQL query that generates is not optimized at
present. It's there if you need it, but make sure it's not something
you do often, or try to cache the results for a time, or something
along those lines.

Subject: [wp-hackers] JQuery Color is still part of Wordpress 3.5 ?
Message-ID: <CA+vutv4-PXu8jUQRUwxaeZ_dg-6iNRJCPTwj8qXRQ8UgeVC16w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am debugging one of my plugin. I use JQuery Color plugin to animate table
cells background color (in an admin panel). I relies on the fact that this
JQuery plugin is normally included into Wordpress. It works fine under
3.4.2. But since I have upgraded to 3.5, it doesn't work anymore. I am
trying to determine if JQuery Color is still included with Wordpress
without any success.

Is there somebody to help me to find out if JQuery Color is still part of
Wordpress 3.5 ?

Thanks in advance.

Hi Benjamin!

As you can see in this ticket (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21692)
and in the wp-includes/script-loader.php, jquery color is not enqueued by
default anymore still it's only used in core by wp-lists. It's enqueued as
a dependency now.

If you want to use it without wp-lists being included, you'll now have to
enqueue it manually with the 'jquery-color' id.

Hope that helps ;).

You can actually avoid the version_compare() (which emphasizes version
detection over feature/behavior detection) and just always enqueue
jquery-color. Or even better, set it as a dependency on your own script.
Will work fine before and after 3.5.

Merry Christmas everyone.
I need a drop down to select the "author" of a post, and the standard metabox (authordiv) only lists admins.Is there a filter to add more users/roles to that list?
Alternatively is there a plug-in that allows this?
Thanks,Kev

No, the post_author_meta_box lists all eligible authors, not just
administrators.

It calls this function:
wp_dropdown_users( array(
		'who' => 'authors',
		'name' => 'post_author_override',
		'selected' => empty($post->ID) ? $user_ID : $post->post_author,
		'include_selected' => true
	) );

Eventually that "who" field makes its way down to WP_User_Query, which
interprets it as being all users with a usermeta field of "user_level"
that is != 0. Which is essentially all the users on the blog.

	in-compatibilities)
Message-ID: <CALNB6gYXbC4kOtgQa1_9_GrFhJ1uTEPnuo_qneFuEBLNSiNpOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,
 It's been a while since I posted here. I'm running into an issue, where
we're seeing measurable performance gains by running sites on PHP 5.4,
except every now and then we run into plugins that pass variables by
reference to functions.

This was deprecated in PHP 5.0, and is backwards incompatible as of PHP
5.4.0
For plugins that are passing stuff around to themselves, the fixes are
easy. We're passing patches back to the authors of those plugins as
necessary.

But every now and then, especially in BuddyPress, we run into this issue
where lots of calls are being made to do_action() and apply_filters()

This means the core functions need their declarations changed.
I'm wondering how big of an undertaking this is, since this is supported
through PHP 5.0, changing the declaration should not have any adverse
effects.

More info can be found here:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.allow-call-time-pass-reference

If this should be a Trac ticket, I'll do that.

I'd have to see specific instances to be sure, but generally speaking,
this is the result of passing an object by reference to an action or filter.
In core, we have done this with do_action_ref_array() and
apply_filters_ref_array(), rather with do_action() or apply_filters().

In PHP 5.x, this is no longer needed for objects, and it doesn't make
much sense to need a reference for anything besides objects, anyway.
So, we are no longer using apply_filters_ref_array() and
do_action_ref_array() in core. We should probably "soft-deprecate" these
functions with a message in the Codex.

However, *we can't remove existing instances* of _ref_array() calls
without breaking plugins. Plugin callbacks tied to existing _ref_array()
actions might be explicitly asking for their value to be passed by
reference, like so:

do_action_ref_array( 'example_hook', array( &$var ) );
add_action( 'example_hook', 'my_callback' );
function my_callback( &$var ) {}

If they suddenly stop receiving the variable by reference, an E_WARNING
is issued. That's no fun.

So, I'm not entirely sure of a path forward here, and open to suggestions.

Would we consider adding a constant (with caveat[1]) that is halfway between WP_DEBUG=true and WP_DEBUG=false?  One that is set true for new sites but false for upgraded sites, a WP_NO_DEPRECATED constant?  This way plugin authors would have most of an incentive to fix deprecated usage as their plugins would fail for newer sites that don't allow deprecated usage?

Okay, so, in that version of BuddyPress, they were doing:

do_action( 'example_hook', &$this );

Instead of what BuddyPress now does:

do_action_ref_array( 'example_hook', array( &$this ) );

Even better would be:

do_action( 'example_hook', $this );

We simply have do_action_ref_array() pass all of its arguments to
do_action()
when WP_DEBUG is on, which would thus trigger E_WARNINGs in the situation
I described and could then be dealt with. It'd be a good start.

Understood. I was hoping for a solution to nudge all the developers who do not use WP_DEBUG because they forget[1] or worse are (initially) not willing to[2] unless many people tell them otherwise.  

I don't know how many there are that fit in category [2] but in my limited experience using other's plugins at least 1-in-3 fit in category [1].

Subject: [wp-hackers] Javascript bind event for 3.5's new uploader?
Message-ID: <CAFnKAk0qOQwDUmc2LWqkvj9aOaGdk1U16r0H9FruXAeFoDWERQ@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks for the helpful reply. I've noticed a problem in more complex
cases, though.

I was using the wp.media.editor.add('content') to access the editor on
the wp-admin. Unfortunately on pages that don't have that editor, but
a different editor, it will mess up the editor's uploader. Something
went wrong in the code, and $index was undefined when I tried to
upload a new file - file didn't upload.

Checking for existence of wp.media.editor.get('content') and using it,
solves this problem, but I noticed another...
After calling up the single-file-upload-selector, (the same way
custom-background.js does), uploading and then showing a new
mce-editor, I found that the mce-editor's uploader fails to upload a
new file.

I haven't found much documentation on the wp.media objects, I was
wondering if there is yet any detailed documentation on the Javascript
events, and/or what is required to handle these Backbone.js objects
when creating and removing multiple tinyMCE editors?

Best regards,
Luke

Subject: [wp-hackers] Running a network
Message-ID: <CAGguigczDd8yjBX_rt0j0TJxCybZF18-tqHTxke0reHLcKV+qA@mail.gmail.com>

I've been having an issue with site speed for some time.  My site is a
commerce site with subdomain sites for author's book creation.
(Litsam.com)  At first I blamed wp e-commerce, which surely loads a
lot of files, but moving to another shopping cart didn't help.  I also
realized that it was often the very first http call that would take a
long time -- up to 19 seconds once, but not infrequently in the 5-15
seconds range. That suggested that reducing the number of files being
loaded or other standard optimizations wouldn't help.

So then I decided it was the host I'd moved to and I started a move to
another new host. Things on the main commerce site were spiffy-fast at
the new host right up until I realized my network wasn't actually
active because I hadn't turned on wildcard domains.  As soon as I did
that the site started to exhibit the same behaviour. Sometimes it was
fine, but periodically it was definitely not fine.

So that's two hosts that were doing ok until I turned on networking.

I've been trying to work up the gumption to research server/wildcard
configurations. If I wanted to be a sysadm, I would have been one.
*sigh*

But today I found another apparently network-related issue that leaves
me wondering how to configure a Wordpress subdomain network install so
that it isn't a resource hog. It must be possible, as I know people
are using this feature commercially...

About a year ago I set up a prototype site for a client who wanted to
use some fancy image transitions, so I installed skitter
(http://thiagosf.net/projects/jquery/skitter/). Initial experiments
went fine but the project lapsed for half a year, and when she was
ready to pick it up I'd gotten "organized" and started using a
subdomain network to host my prototypes, rather than freestanding
installs for each one.  I moved her over to the new system for
consistency.

Immediately I had problems with skitter. Some effects never worked,
though they worked on the skitter site.  Others were jumpy and
unreliable.  I wasted a half a dozen hours trying different versions
of jquery, making sure I was using exactly the same versions of all
the files as the skitter site, etc. Nothing helped.

Until I moved the site to a freestanding Wordpress install (off the
network) to go live.  Suddenly skitter is working perfectly again.

This suggests to me that simply having a network is somehow impacting
performance enough to cause the fairly intensive animation system to
fail. It's not a script conflict -- I spent hours ensuring that --
it's actually the exact same code running fine in a lone Wordpress
site and failing in a networked subdomain site.

Anyone else had this kind of problem, or have any suggestions?
Currently the only plans I've come up with for my main commerce site
are either to throw more server resources at the problem and see it if
goes away, or to redesign it so that I'm not using a subdomain
network.

I'd rather fix it, if a fix exists.

Given sufficient resources, WordPress multisite is usually well-behaved on
large networks.

Typical causes of multisite performance problems:

1) Hundreds of thousands of spam profiles on a site that are flagged as
spammers. Each of those spam profiles consumes ~10 DB tables. We had one
site with 100K+ auto-flagged spam profiles on it that had over *a million*
db tables. Deleting those tables dramatically improved site load times.

2) Excessive crawler hits, causing memory starvation on the server, aborted
PHP threads,   SQL server throttling, and bandwidth throttling. In one case
we had Google hitting a large site dozens of times a second, causing the
active PHP threads to consume the entire 1GB cap on the server. The site
owner accidentally triggered the crawler flood by changing the templates on
their site, which changed the page structure on their site, and caused
Google to re-crawl 50,000+ pages. To somebody that can't view the server
stats, the site would load incredibly slowly and possibly throw error pages
from time to time.

3) Javascript code that operates on multisite profiles but not the root
blog, and which blocks the DOM ready event until complete. Many possible
sources including plugins and themes.

4) However, if:

a) You had multisite up and running and could view the individual user blogs
b) Then you enabled wildcard domains
c) Then the site became very slow

That means there's something wrong with your DNS settings. Something is
timing out, then hitting the next node up and finding what its looking for.

OOOH...tell me why it would matter if I had javascript code that
operated on multisite but not on the root blog?  My subdomain "author"
sites rely on quite a bit of display-altering javascript that has
nothing to do with the parent site.

No, I didn't have multisite running.  I *thought* I did, went through
testing the main site's functionality (shopping cart etc. etc.) was
pretty happy with the new server, went to the first subdomain and it
wasn't there.  Turned on the wildcard domains setting.  As soon as I
did, it went back to dog-slow.

And THANK YOU.  That is absolutely the most robust answer I've gotten
in six months of asking around at various places.

Six months is a long time to have a problem!

You need to install something to profile your WordPress install and see exactly what is going on under the hood and what is causing this performance issue.

Here are some links to tools you could use. Time stack might be easiest if you have access to a Memcached server, otherwise maybe the debug bar extender (which I've never used); failing that you could install one of the others but then you're getting further into sysadmin!
