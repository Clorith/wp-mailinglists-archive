Subject: [wp-hackers] is there a hook firing right after the </html>?
Message-ID: <CAHERW=1jrYm2a-RCrD=_iLfvK2R0jLRYr7xOgJUYKyqkv18vXQ@mail.gmail.com>

I need to run ob_get_clean() as soon as the get_footer() is done running -
meaning as soon as the </html> is outputted.

What hook can I use for that?

more insight on why do I need that?
the goal is to put the generated html ( from <doctype to </html> ) into a
transient.
and for this goal, I set the "ob_buffer" using the get_header() action hook.
but that's only half of the deal...
I still need to catch the buffer when i am done with the full page -
meaning when I am done wirth outputting the </html>

is there a hook such as "after_get_footer" ?

There is no 'after_get_footer' hook. Maybe you can use 
'template_include' filter to encapsulate the working template with your 
ob_* functions. You should notice, some themes doesn't use get_footer 
function.. they must include wp_head() but get_footer() isn't required 
as far as I know.. Another option may be using 
register_shutdown_function() ? ..

Good Luck !

You should take a look at some of the full-page caching plugins which
are available (seeing as that's what you're trying to do) and see how
they operate. The 'shutdown' hook is probably what you're after.

Output buffer callbacks are automatically called at the conclusion of the
script.

There is a 'shutdown' hook that fires on a shutdown handler that you can
also use.

Automatically called bhy WordPress? I'm interested in seeing where that
happens Nacin. I'm not sure what happens in that section of the code...

For my sake, I think I can pretty much rely on shutdown hook. To me, that
fires as much as get_footer hook would fire.
Since my old implementation was running right after the get_footer() call,
and I was fine with that, I should be fine with the shutdown as well.

Looks like 'shutdown' is the only hook left - after the final breath is
given with the </html>.



Interesting...  so to tap into that area, what do you do? modify the core?
But for a generic solution, I want my plug in cache the page at the end. In
this case,  'shutdown' is the only option to

This is not a good idea because of wp_options table in database, I think.
There are full page cache plugins which are doin a job.

No, by PHP itself, actually.

When you create an output buffer using ob_start() and fail to clear it with
an appropriate ob_end_* call, then PHP will flush the output buffer at the
end of script execution.

Notably, this actually happens before any callbacks that were passed to
register_shutdown_function() are called. Shutdown functions don't get the
contents of the output buffer.

Otto,

Are you saying that by the time ( shutdown_action_hook ) runs, PHP has
already cleared the output_buffer automatically? or am I misunderstanding
you?
I though PHP's internal shutdown functions would run only and only after
the last line of script has been executed...  Since wordpress is still
running at that time, why would PHP clear the output buffer?

In that case, I won't be able to use the 'shutdown' hook for my purpose.

Yes, my knowledge might be out of date on that one. From lower in the page
it seems that that behavior may have changed between PHP 5.0 and 5.1. In
which case output buffers would be accessible from shutdown callbacks.

did a quick search.

Subject: [wp-hackers] What happened to plans for unbundling language files
	for plugins?
Message-ID: <54D1FCD7.9030003@wordshell.net>

Hi,

Does anyone know what happened to the plans for providing a way for 
plugins to unbundle their language (mo/po) files from the main plugin, 
so that WP would have a mechanism for downloading them separately? This 
mechanism now exists for core, but not for plugins, AFAIK. WooCommerce 
implemented their own mechanism, and whilst it's tempting to do the 
same, it feels like a problem that needs solving at a higher level.

UpdraftPlus, for example, now has 8Mb of language files bundled (2.4Mb 
when zipped). wordpress.org servers have shipped an extra 140 gigabytes 
worth of UpdraftPlus in the last week because of this.

Best wishes,
David

This is being actively worked on right now, for all plugins:

It sounds like WordPress won't be participating in GSoC this year, 
because not enough people have stepped up to coordinate our participation.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Queries for GSOC 15
Message-ID: <BLU170-W866A9EA7D8CA7039FE9EB9AD220@phx.gbl>

Hello People,
I was wondering if Wordpress is applying for GSOC this year 2015. Since the Organisation Application has already started, I wanted to know whether Wordpress is applying or not.
I have been working on a idea which I want to work on as a GSOC project for Wordpress.
I would be happy if I can be put in touch with some potential mentors with whom I can discuss my ideas and come up with a good project proposal (provided wordpress is applying for GSOC). 

Thanks for taking time to read my mail.

Shreyans Gandhi,India

Subject: [wp-hackers] advanced taxonomy queries thru pretty urls
Message-ID: <CAHERW=26K47jGTNq4Gm6+JHVKPp4UwEnzSYfRPUC6N1fiXLrQA@mail.gmail.com>

A link like this

site.com /resources/?tax1=slug1,slig2&category_name=featured

runs a taxonomy query in the back end and gives us all the resources (
resources is the custom post type here ) where the resuorces are tagged by
either 'slug1' or 'slug 2' under the 'tax1' AND at the same time also
categorized as 'featured'

This is a beautiful implementation. And it just works, And thru the use of
(,) or (+) usage, one can do highly complex advanced taxonomy queries thru
these pretty URLs

2 questions here...

what do I need to replace the "resources" CPT in there to make itlink work
with regular posts? I tried "post" as a replacement and I'm getting a 404
with that link.


And also, In the codex, I could not find a 'NOT IN' operator that would
correspond to a symbol in the query string.
For example, I'm not sure what the link should look like to pull those
posts where the resources are everything **except** those that are termed
as 'slug1' or 'slug2'

Hmm not sure, but try using site.com/?tax.... instead of "resources" in the
middle.

Also, you might be able to use a minus sign for "NOT IN", e.g.
?tax1=-slug1,slug2.
Otherwise, this needs to be implemented manually and isn't supported
out-of-the-box by core.

Looks like there's no GSoC for WordPress this year.
