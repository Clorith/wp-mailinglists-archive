10K users isn't too many.  I've worked on sites with 50K users on 
$6/month shared hosting.  Just having a lot of users shouldn't be an 
issue with loading.

This kind of problem came to me, in my last project, where we have 175K
users and 55 usermeta for each user, THAT is problem, because you can't
even access the wp-admin, we haven't figured yet why.
Maybe because WP is making some kind of caching on this usermeta, don't
know yet.

But still, the site (user end) runs smoothly! It's kind of impressive!

They don't return true when undefined, actually; they return strings.
It's just PHP making assumptions for you again.

Any undefined constant used like that is assumed to actually be an
unquoted static string. If you turn PHP Notices and error reporting
on, you'll see a message like this:

Notice:  Use of undefined constant WHATEVER - assumed 'WHATEVER' in
script.php on line 123

Basically it's evaluating that constant as the string instead. And any
string except the empty string is equivalent to "true" when used as a
boolean expression. So, there you go.

It's unlikely to be an issue with the users table or the number of
users or even the number of meta. WordPress.org has a tad under 3
million registered users, with something like 20 million rows of meta
on the main usermeta table and dozens of other similar tables for
various things. Now, this is mirrored across a bunch of separate
database servers, but it scales fine.

The number of rows or size of your tables is rarely the main problem.
MySQL scales quite well in that respect, as do all other modern
databases. The real scaling problems lie in concurrency. The database
can be as big as creation and still serve things lightning fast thanks
to indexing, but even small databases will choke when you start making
thousands of requests per second to them.

If you're unable to load the back end at all, then it's unlikely to be
a table holding a mere few million rows that is the problem. Databases
with *billions* of rows can easily be made and will generally work
fine. Instead, it's more likely that you have a misbehaving
plugin/theme or other form of code causing the system to choke.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Problems setting publication date with newPost and
	perl WordPress::XMLRPC
Message-ID: <loom.20120202T163858-500@post.gmane.org>

Hi folks,

     I'm trying to use Leo Charre's WordPress::XMLRPC perl module to create new
posts that have publication dates in the past.  (I'm going to import some old
posts.)  Everything works fine except setting the publication date.  No matter
what I do, the publication date is always now, instead of the date I specify. 
Here's an excerpt from the code:

use WordPress::XMLRPC

my $postid = $wprpc->newPost({
    title       => $title,
    description => $body,
    pubDate     => $gmtisodate,
    categories  => ["News"]
                             });

I've tried several different date formats, and they're all accepted without
complaint, but the results are the same.

     Any advice would be appreciated.

                                               Thanks,
                                               Bryan

Not sure why you're using pubDate in that struct. I think you should
be using something more like this:

dateCreated => '20080121T12:38:30',
date_created_gmt => '20080121T20:38:30',

Followed the link to your plugin and it seems to have a conflict in
personality, so I downloaded it. It checks out and is indeed a plugin for
adding a snow flake effect via jQuery and not a plugin to display products
from an OSCommerce shopping cart database as the plugin description
states...

"Plugin for displaying products from an OSCommerce shopping cart database"

Ignoring the title/description fuzziness, and jumping directly to check  
the code, here are some friendly advices:
* use already declared javascript enqueues (jquery in your case),  
redeclare it only if you have compatibility issues
* don't use common names for enque ID, think about a namespace for your  
plugin and stick with it in any ID/name you will use [1]
* code is poetry! what happened to your indentation?

Good luck!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Just a basic "how can this be accomplished?" question.
Message-ID: <1328449425.2650.8.camel@i7>

Hello,
could you please help me by supplying a short sketch for a plugin that
performs the steps described below? 
What I need is just a short list of steps that are required. Something
in the form of:
    1. do this to accomplish....
    2. use this function for that... 
    3. do/use this because...

Here's what the plugin should do:
1. Add a global javascript variable to the output html page.
2. Add/Load a javascript file at the output html page.
3. Add/Load a css file at the output html page.
4. Do the above steps only at one particular wordpress page.
5. Do it in the fastest possible way, but I do NOT like to modify any
wordpress or template files, as I'm aiming for a stand alone plugin.

Knowing what steps I have to do and in what order they have to be done
to accomplish this plugin would help me very much.
I'm grateful for any advice, 
Thank you!

Do we need to generate attachments metadata for custom headers and

First, you will have to know the ID of the particular page you want to
modify. You can create a settings page for users to select that page, or
calculate it however you need to. Store that as a plugin option to save the
trouble of calculating that on every page load.

Hook into wp_enqueue_scripts. That's the best place to set scripts and
styles to enqueue. You can enqueue the scripts using wp_enqueue_script and
wp_enqueue_style, and generate the variables to pass to your javascript
using wp_localize_script.

Your function will look something like this (I'm assuming the page you want
to modify is stored in a function called 'this_plugin_page')

add_action( 'wp_enqueue_script', 'my_plugin_enqueues' );

function my_plugin_enqueues() {
    $plugin_page = get_option( 'this_plugin_page' );
    if ( !is_page( $plugin_page ) )
        return;
    wp_enqueue_script( 'myscript', plugins_url('/js/newscript.js',
__FILE__) );
    $script_vars = array( 'this' => 'that', 'foo' => 'bar' );
    wp_localize_script( 'myscript', 'scriptVars', $script_vars );
    wp_enqueue_style( 'mystyle',  plugins_url('/css/newstyle.css',
__FILE__) );
}

Hi Nathaniel,

thank you very much for the detailed answer!
It works perfect! I ended up with 7 lines of code and 42 lines of
comments :) 
Thanks again!

Message-ID: <000001cce451$bf0f5a00$3d2e0e00$@fris.net>

Has anyone experienced any issues with an ajax request taking forever on
some hosts?

On localhost, and a few other servers my code works fine.

But on one freebsd box (php 5.3.10, apache 2.2)

The ajax itself works, its just very slow to complete.

Curious if anyone else has run into this issue and what the problem may be?

Thanks.

Are any of your plugins or theme(s) using PHP sessions?

If so, this post may be relevant:
http://shout.setfive.com/2012/01/18/ajax-request-slow-with-php-heres-why/

Reconfiguring your server to store PHP sessions in a MySQL database
(instead of on the filesystem) may help.

So this is a mysql config issue?

Im doing the exactly same code, and it works on other servers.

Are any of your plugins or theme(s) using PHP sessions?

If so, this post may be relevant:

Reconfiguring your server to store PHP sessions in a MySQL database (instead
of on the filesystem) may help.

I would say it more a php issue than mysql issue.

If any of your active plugins (or theme) use the session_start() function,
then its possible that its contributing to your slow ajax requests. Try
deactivating any plugin(s) that use PHP sessions, and see if your ajax
requests speed up.

The issue is dependent on how PHP's session storage mechanism is
configured, which is why it might be an issue on some hosts but not others.

And the code doesn't use sessions.

Related: are there any plugins out there that do this using wpdb sanely?
I can't find any with a quick search.

Message-ID: <CAN_8tK6MbyhWb_BTwPAp=qfiiQuyGrjDZ=mtxBrjtd8JBqwnag@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to intercept the entire HTML page generated on a page load in
WordPress. the_content() is not enough as I need some filtering in the meta
tags, footer, sidebar etc.

I've been looking for some filters and the HTTP API, but nothing seems to
work on a page basis, i.e. post-filtering of every element in the entire
DOM tree.

Any tips on this?

Use output buffering. On the init action, do an ob_start(), then hook
a function to the shutdown action hook and you can do an
ob_get_clean() to get the contents, filter them as you will, then echo
the result.

Not the best, but the only whole-page method I know of.

I've tried one solution from stackexchange:

http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/41351/11506

Didn't seem to work though, the end buffering had problems and the content
was blank at the end. Or am I doing it wrong?

That looks like it's the right idea..

The basic paradigm is:

Somewhere very early on do
ob_end_clean(); // Ensure a clean buffer.
ob_start();

On the "wp" or "init" action should be fine.

Then, as the very last thing you do, capture, process and echo the results
$body = ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();  // Clear the results so the unaltered stuff isn't sent
echo makeItBetter($body);

Perhaps in the "shutdown" action. (I've heard rumors of times shutdown 
is not called, I have no specifics on that. That may just have been when 
a die() was hit.)

Headers, if you need them, can be gotten through $headers = headers_list();

You could even do this code before and after the wp stuff in the main 
index.php, but you're likely to be slapped in the face with a large 
trout if you try something as hackish as that.

Hope that helps,

Sure, I can do it in index.php or the wp-blog-header file, but I don't feel
that suicidal yet :)

Will try this out, thanks. I remember having some problems with the
shutdown hook, but it should work for normal posts and standard post types
I believe.

Thanks,

Don't buffer your whole page, it is not a good idea for page response 
time. Instead, in your template file, use ob_start("your filter 
function") and ob_end_flush() to filter the_header(), the_content(), 
the_sidebar(), and the_footer() separately.
Or if you really want to do a whole page filter. template_redirect is 
the best hook to start the buffer, and use php function 
register_shutdown_function() to flush the buffer.

Don't use the register_shutdown_function() call. WordPress already
does that for you automatically. Just use the "shutdown" action hook
instead.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Ajax requests, admin-ajax.php and the WP_ADMIN constant
Message-ID: <24355460.1426.1328587340955.JavaMail.geo-discussion-forums@yqcg21>

I'm currently developing an app that needs some ajax requests. Suddenly I 
found myself in a weird position: I couldn't make any requests from my ajax 
callback function. Everything loaded fine, the request was sent via 
jQuery.post() and the response was `0`. As I made the request from inside a 
class, I tested if I could hook the callback from outside and it worked.  

After a lot of debugging [1] I found the *"error"*: is_admin() returns true 
as admin-ajax.php defines WP_ADMIN as true on top of the file. This is a 
bit weird behavior, as we got the wp_ajax_* (admin/logged-in) and the 
wp_ajax_nopriv_* (public/guest) hook. If I want to, like in my case, built 
the front-end stuff completely separated from the back end extensions, then 
I have the problem that I simply can't divide stuff. This brings me in a 
strange situation for organizing my files: I can't stick stuff together 
that belongs together.

Is there some work-around, some ideas, some concepts? Or does the ticket 
from Denis-de-Bernard [2] will receive some attention for 3.4?

Thanks!

[1] I found the note about the is_admin() in the Ajax Codex article a 
little too late: http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins
[2] http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12400

Mario,

Are you using str_replace or preg_replace on the entire set of buffered
page content? That may explain your blank output.
I am doing something very similar and was getting blank output as well when
trying to use those functions with very large (100,000+ character) strings.

Haven't come up with a solution yet, but hopefully that helps you track
down your problem. (Ultimately I decided I didn't really *need* to replace
those characters anyhow...)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Getting the entire HTML page generated from
	WordPress
In-Reply-To: <CABs8xe66RMu9ydUjj-RgiO2Y=cK8TezThnfMaDhZx1iP7tTG-w@mail.gmail.com>

I actually tried to debug the plain buffer with no modifications at first
so there is another problem in the way. I'll try the suggestions above and
then proceed with the formatting. I've also read a lot about the regex
functions and their performance and I'll try not to overuse them.

Best,

As an alternate solution depending on the situation, you could have
considered using a postmeta field in the post editor to store a flag that
activates the feature, then in the template check if is_page() and if the
postmeta flag is set for the current page. That would have the benefit that
any author could activate it for a page and obviously also that you could
have it for multiple pages without complicating the interface.

Glad it worked out with the option, that is also a very simple solution.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Changing term IDs
Message-ID: <CAJmHdUK_CQfQ-OfGOVAzqPzAuhM5QwCyV+Hb=SnvhedjNM_4fQ@mail.gmail.com>

We have a few different taxonomies that share terms ? for example, Maine as
a category and as a region. However, when we created the regions we didn't
name a few of them exactly as they should have been, so the slugs got
messed up (State of Maine as a category with the slug maine, Maine as a
region, so the category slug is maine and the region slug is maine-2). I'd
like to make the slugs line up, and I'm wondering if there would be any
adverse effects if I simply went into _term_taxonomy and change the term ID
of the region to the term ID of the category so the slugs line up.

Hi all,

I would like to upload the avatar of a new user directly in the "New
user" page, so avoiding to go back to "Edit profile" page and use the
plugin User Avatar http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-avatar/

Did anyone already implement this feature?

Thanks

I've been looking for the same thing for a client that's using a similar
plugin (Simple Local Avatars.)

Because the new user doesn't actually have an ID yet, it's difficult
to assign any extra data to the user at this point in the process.

A possible solution is to improve the workflow by sending the client
to the edit page of the newly created user, rather than the Users
list, which I believe currently happens.

It means the client is sent to the edit screen automatically to add
any additional info, instead of having to find them.

If this is preferable, you should be able to use wp_redirect() after
the user's been created.

I have been taking the approach of making custom post types to use as
profiles. It does feel a bit long winded to start with, but it is so much
easier to handle posts.

Hi;

I was wondering how I could get all media uploads by author with the URL
(w/ thumbnail), title, and perhaps the caption and description. I'm sure
this is possible, just can't find out how to do it. :p I would like to use
this on the authors.php page.

Any help would be appreciated.

admin-ajax.php does indeed report that it is in the admin, despite the
availability
of wp_ajax_nopriv_*. This is intended behavior.

I imagine what you are doing is using is_admin() to decide whether or not
you
should include a file or attach a hook? If that is the case, you could
leverage
defined('DOING_AJAX'), or simply always attach the hook (add_action() is
very
cheap). If for some reason this doesn't trigger a solution for you, then I
really
just don't know what you're trying to do, but ? at least know that the
behavior
you're seeing is intentional. It should be easy to work around.

If you upload an image to be a header or background, WordPress will
store it in the media library and will generate the metadata like it does
any other attachment. (And it can be added to posts, or what not, like
any other attachment.)

In 3.4, themes can opt into flexible/fluid header heights and widths,
rather than having a pre-defined width and height. In this case, we use
the metadata so proper width and height attributes can be added.

There is no requirement for slugs to be unique across all term IDs. You can
have
term ID 1 for 'maine' and term ID 2 for 'maine', one being a category and
one being
a region. I would go into wp_terms and update the bad slug, rather than
making
them share term IDs. (In your case, sharing term IDs is going to be just
fine,
but in more general usage, shared term IDs can cause problems.)

Media uploads are just posts of type *attachment*. So, they're stored in
the posts table and you can use *get_posts*:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts#Show_all_attachments

The title, caption, and description are stored in standard post fields, but
I don't remember what's what. Do a var_dump of one of the posts you
retrieve (or just poke around your database) to figure it out.

You can get the URL with *wp_get_attachment_url* :
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_attachment_url

You can get the thumb URL with *wp_get_attachment_thumb_url:*
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_attachment_thumb_url

Subject: [wp-hackers] Expensive meta query - Is there a better way?
Message-ID: <4F33B4AD.2070007@gmail.com>

Hello,

We're running a multiple meta query lookup in WordPress - however the DB 
query most be expensive as it's result in very slow (20/30 second) 
response times in PHP with only 300 posts (total) in the DB. Query below.

Is there a better way of doing the below? Essentially if $value is equal 
to key1 or key2 or key3 or key4 or key5 (the keys are numbered 
consecutively).


'post_type' => 'custom_post_type',
'meta_query' => array(
         'relation' => 'OR',
         array(
             'key' => 'key1',
             'value' => $value,
             'compare' => '=',
         ),
         array(
             'key' => 'key2',
             'value' => $value,
             'compare' => '=',
         ),
         array(
             'key' => 'key3',
             'value' => $value,
             'compare' => '=',
         ),
         array(
             'key' => 'key4',
             'value' => $value,
             'compare' => '=',

The post meta is really poorly structured for queries. If I remember correctly, the default schema doesn't even have an index on the value column, but that's just the start of reasons why queries against that table run slowly. 

You can add indexes to the post meta table, but you'd do well to consider using the taxonomies tables instead. Those are very well architected for post selection queries. 

The rules I follow for my sites:

Use postmeta for fielded data displayed once the post is found. 

Use taxonomies to find the posts to display.

Greetings to all ,

(My Apology, if this is not to be asked here )

I have been learning php for an while and is in an good position in it. I
have choosen WordPress as my first real world php project( To familiarize
with php standards and be part of an leading blog engine) for study.

I have by this time knowledge in plugin writting ,but I would like to get
familiarised with the code base of WordPress . So Where should I begin ,
could any body suggest an source tree ?

Message-ID: <CAJbdpGvYVwvUZMi8FJaS3_z2ovXb3nbjL4EoZe7_QYE=Gfuynw@mail.gmail.com>

I've run into problems with some code that uses a foreach loop on
$wp_roles->roles - the array of roles in the $wp_roles global.

Worked fine in my testing but caused all sorts of problems for some other
users of my Facebook Tab Manager plugin. The code I originally released
failed to check for the existence of the array, and people got PHP errors
from iterating on a non-existent array. I figured it was a global, so it's
got to be there, right? Apparently not.

I've semi-fixed this with an update, which tests to make sure the variable
is set first. To fix it right, I probably need to understand what's going
on.

Is the $wp_roles->roles variable only set under certain circumstances, like
when a user is logged in? I tried to test that by logging out and browsing
my test site, but I still didn't see the errors other people are seeing.

Context: This is related to a function that sets the roles and capabilities
for my custom post type to parallel those of regular posts. Depending on an
options setting, editing rights may or may not be assigned to authors and
contributors.

Casey Bisson is correct of course - however if you need to use the
post_meta table you could try a custom query along these lines:

SELECT * from wp_posts 
WHERE ID IN (
			SELECT post_id from pp_2_postmeta 
			WHERE ((meta_key = 'key1' AND meta_value =
'value')
			OR (meta_key = 'key2' AND meta_value = 'value')
			OR (meta_key = 'key3' AND meta_value = 'value')
			OR (meta_key = 'key4' AND meta_value = 'value')
			OR (meta_key = 'key5' AND meta_value = 'value'))
		)
AND post_type = 'custom_post_type'
AND post_status = '...'
etc

Sure this can be written more efficiently if you want to refine it
further - but should be significantly quicker than the 20 second +
queries you were having.

If you want to just look at a straight code tree, you can always browse 
the trac repo here:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.3.1

I'm sure you realize that WordPress is a huge project. It has been 
evolving over most of a decade now and many people have put many many 
hours of development into it.  Back when WordPress was first released, a 
person stood a fairly good chance of knowing and understanding the whole 
code base.  Now, if you don't live in the WordPress Core everyday, it's 
not a realistic goal for the typical person.

I'd recommend that you pick a specific area to study.  For example, you 
could familiarize yourself with WordPress's filters or actions.  Here 
are some suggestions:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference
http://codex.wordpress.org/Options_API
MORE READING: http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_API's

If you want something more in depth,  you could trace through the code 
for displaying the home page or the general options page.  Those alone 
are a very interesting topics.   So start somewhere smaller than the 
whole code base. Once you understand that topic, move onto a related 
area of code.

Oh and the HitchHacker's Guide has some useful tools for looking up 
specific functions you come across along the way:
http://lookup.hitchhackerguide.com/*
http://hitchhackerguide.com/function-filter-action-index/

Hope that helps!

And check the codex for the API reference.

Hey everyone,

I know there is a function that I believe the category and tag ID are
passed through when ever ones is added or removed from a post. I've looked
through the core and can't for the life of me find the function. Does
anyone know the function I speak of and/or where I might locate it.

Thanks in advance.

I'm not sure why the $wp_roles object would be unnavailable sometimes, but
maybe your users are seeing errors you aren't because they have error
reporting in PHP turned up higher than you.

If you aren't already, you should enable WP_DEBUG and the Debug Bar plugin
and use them when developing. WP_DEBUG will make you see as many errors as
possible and the Debug Bar plugin will give you a nice button that lights
up orange when there is a warning or notice anywhere on the page, useful
when the errors aren't in places you commonly look.

You should also enable WP_DEBUG_LOG, which will write all errors to a
/wp-content/debug.log file. Tail that file (using command line, or the
Console app on OSX) to catch ALL the errors, even ones that happen behind
the scenes in AJAX calls.

Learn all about it on my favorite site on the internet:

Brian's links to the Codex are probably where you should start if what you
want to do is understand how plugins work. Also pick a popular plugin and
look at it's code and use the Codex to try and understand all the parts.

If what you want is a simple way to surf the raw source the most
entertaining way is a PHPXref of the project. An Xref is an auto-generated
website created by a script that reads the source and creates interlinked
html of all files, functions and variables, so you can click on a function
being used to see where it's defined as well as where else it gets used.
Peter Westwood maintains the most canonical PHPXref of WordPress trunk that
I know of:

http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/nav.html?index.html

An even better way is to get WP loaded up in a serious IDE (programming
editor) like netbeans.org, at which point the source files themselves
become navigable like in the Xref.

You will probably be satisfied by wp_set_object_terms() in
/wp-includes/taxonomy.php and the 'set_object_terms' *action*  (not
function) it runs right before returning.

Try looking at wp_update_term_count() in /wp-includes/taxonomy.php

Taxonomies can register their own custom callback function, but this is the
function used by post tags and categories.

Yes.

So far I couldn't (after a cross file search through core files) get around 
what the constant is for. The other problem is that I don't really 
understand what you're trying to tell me (english != mother tongue). Are 
you saying that the include !is_admin() will trigger a ajax cb fn when it 
that is hooked to wp_ajax_nopriv_* when it starts with define( 
'DOING_AJAX', true );? Also: What do you mean with the add_action and cheap 
sentence?

Thanks a lot for the exaplanation!

@Nacin

After re-reading your mail several times, I guess I now understand.

* Check if DOING_AJAX is true, if not: don't do anything
* hook the wp_ajax_* and wp_ajax_nopriv_* actions always

To clarify: I loaded several modules from my functions.php file. In the 
bootstrap I used there, I simply divided into modules that I need on the 
front-end and other I need on the back end/admin UI. I wrapped the whole 
stuff into 

a) an if/else is_admin() statement and
b) a /theme_root/admin/module_name_a/files*.php and a 
/theme_root/public/module_name_b/files*.php folder

The goal was to avoid possible conflicts between admin and public code. My 
"problem" is, that I have several ajax calls in public files, which didn't 
work as I already killed them when loading the modules as they were inside 
! is_admin().

Last Q: Why do we need WP_Admin set to TRUE on top of admin-ajax.php?

Hi,

I thought I'd read something a long while back about a limitation with 
Custom Post Types where we couldn't more than X number of CPTs or X 
number of taxonomies, but maybe I confusing that with some other issue.

Are there any known limits?

The reason I ask is that we have a site where we're using numerous CPTs 
and associated taxonomies. And at some point after adding new 
CPTs/taxonomies permalinks start to break where viewing various posts 
and/or pages begin to return 404 errors.

For example, we might add a new CPT and taxonomy related to cars. We 
activate the plugin, update permalinks. Then try to about the "About Us" 
page (unrelated to the CPT of course) and we get a 404. And the CPT 
posts might also return 404.

If we then disable a couple of plugins that define CPTs and their 
taxonomies, then update permalinks, the 404 errors stop.

Any idea why this would happen?

Below is an example of how we're defining CPTs.

I found that every reference to $wp_roles in WordPress core was wrapped
with an isset check, so I just needed to do the same:

if ( ! isset( $wp_roles ) )
$wp_roles = new WP_Roles();

Is there a reason you are defining your custom post type slug as 'rewrite'
=> array('slug' => false) . I believe that would prevent the post type from
properly displaying. Am I missing something? I think if you are trying to
have your podcast show up as http://www.site.com/my-podcast-slug you would
use 'rewrite' => array('slug' => '').

But i'm also thinking that could create conflicting slugs if you had a
podcast named "About-Us".

For my purposes it should actually be

'rewrite' =>  array('slug' =>  true )

Thanks for the hint!

you may find it weird, actually very weird, but is the following possible>

load up a post or page into the admin panel and place something like
this in to the editor;

<?php

//assume exec-PHP already active

$current_page_url_here = get_current_url();

echo "<a href='{$current_page_url_here}?var1=val1'>click me</a>";

if ( $_GET['var1']=='val1' )
{
   //change the current post's html title to <title>val1</title>
without using javascript/jquery
}
?>

so when the visitor, clicks on the "click me", same page reloads but
this time, the title reads val1, and that's what search engines see
too.
and if it is also possible to change, the_title() to be equal to val1,
that's even better.

But, is such a thing technically possible? Or is it too late at that
time to make those changes?
Could ob_start in any shape or form be deployed here to achieve this goal?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Paged Comments and Memory Usage
Message-ID: <h8ikj751nk3lutarmtk0bn4vik08i9i1bo@4ax.com>

Ran into an interesting issue.

Moved a very popular domain over the weekend from one virtual
dedicated server that was struggling to a new one (Centos 5.6, control
panel Virtualmin).

On the old server (same basic setup) I'd changed various PHP and MySQL
settings, on the new one I'd not made any changes from the default
settings.

The posts with above 2,000 comments (6 posts) were broken, the page
was loading up to where comments are loaded, so the pages were
truncated.

Checked the error logs and had loads of these errors:

[Mon Feb 13 11:03:43 2012] [error] [client *******] PHP Fatal error:
Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 35
bytes) in /home/*******/public_html/wp-includes/comment.php on line
1941, referer: **********

Basically the comments weren't loading at all so the page was
truncated below the main content.

I changed allowed memory to 64mb and the pages load now.

I have the site set to paged comments, the post with 8,000 comments is
paged over 132 pages for example.

Relevant discussion settings are:

Enable threaded 10 levels deep
Break comments into pages, 20 top level

I'd assumed WordPress would only access the comments that are loaded
on the page, so if I go to comments paged 27 and it's got 50 comments
in total only those 50 comments are accessed, but this issue suggests
a lot more than the comments shown in a browser are accessed and this
is using a lot of memory.

Are all comments for a post accessed when a page is loaded?

If so any ideas to reduce the load?

I ran into a similar issue a few years back, I wanted to use the
<!--nextpage-->  WordPress feature for a public domain books site,
wanted to upload entire books as a post and split them using nextpage
but the entire book (some books several MBs in size) was accessed each
page load and it would timeout.

I don't have answer for you question (for comments)

Using <!--nextpage--> doesn't split post to more parts (database
rows), so querying it from the database always returns whole post
(containing all the pages).

Moob question, do you have any cache like Wp-cache installed? That
alone would make a huge different.

Running WP Super Cache with all reccomended settings.

Also tested plugins that interact with comments by turning them off,
same problem.

I wouldn't be surprised if all the comments are loaded in memory, it makes
sense from a lot of angles. Handling all the relationships between comments
in a 10-deep hierarchy at the DB level would just move your performance
problem from Apache into MySQL if you had that many comments to work with.
Also I  imagine loading them all and sorting it out in PHP is not a problem
99% of the time for WP sites.

64MB isn't THAT bad in terms of a memory limit, some WP installs are just
big and heavy (mine needs more than 64MB to run and I have to bump it up
higher if I want an export to finish).

FWIW 8000 comments on one post is also nuts, and 10-deep replies seems
senseless to me. Ideally WP would handle it gracefully anyway, but how can
that be a good experience for someone who wants to comment or read the
comments already there? 8000 posts is enough to fill up an entire forum
worth of threads, where there would be all kinds of useful navigation and
UI for the task of handling such a complex discussion.

PEOPLE: Limit your thread-depth to 5 and if one post gets more than a few
hundred comments just close the discussion! The likelihood that you're
getting productive comments after the 500th is very low, as is the
likelihood that anyone is reading them all. Consider giving your community
a forum or a stackexchange instead.

On the subject of forum software is it a bad idea to use something
that fit in with Wordpress like buddy press? Would phpbb or mybb be
better?

Daniel, do you mean bbPress? http://bbpress.org/ This is the
"official" forum plugin, and integrates nicely with BuddyPress.

Subject: [wp-hackers] track activity of user engagement in plugins
Message-ID: <CAAeEKQOwiy2XX-WtjShnhHd7qQhYH+0MnH-2tCKzTKdyNBOMSQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm developing a commercial plugin where I would like to track the
user engagement, namely the following metrics would be nice:

- how much time has the user spent playing with my plugin since plugin
activation ;
- what is the normal usage of the plugin (once a month? once a week?
once a day?) ;
- while navigating through the plugin does the user go back and forth
a lot of does he follow a certain pattern?;
- etc.

This has the purpose of measuring the extent to which a user has a
meaningful experience when using the plugin.

I'm unsure of what one would use to do this kind of thing, Google
Analytics? Something else? I've been researching this and couldn't
find anything related. Any input appreciated.

Cheers,
N.

One thing to keep in mind - people don't necessarily like to have their
activity tracked by third parties.  Particularly when on their own site.  I
*highly* encourage you to provide an opt-out mechanism for this tracking
feature.

That said, you have some options.

On a basic level, Google Analytics can provide you with a certain amount of
data.  You'll know how many people visit which admin page and how
frequently.  But drilling down into user navigation might be a bit
difficult (Google doesn't provide the best tools in this regard, but hey,
it's free).

You could also build in a mechanism to have your plugin "phone home" to a
system on your own server to register page loads, load times, etc.  Use a
hash unique to a site to track users, and you'll be able to follow specific
users' navigation habits through the plugin.  If you decide to go this
route, BE SURE TO DISCLOSE IT to the user.

There's nothing worse than discovering after you install a plugin that it's
been sending data to a third party without your permission.

Hi all,

I'm looking for some suggestions on how to help clean and prevent hacked 
wordpress installs. These take too long for me to do myself, and there 
seems to be a level of specialized knowledge you need to do it well 
anyway, or else the hacks just come back. I've been taking a look at 
VaultPress's Premium service - but I don't know how robust that is.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Hopefully you've taken all the recommended measures for installing WordPress
securely and perhaps added in some .htaccess measures.  That should put you
in a good place.

As for help, check out sucuri.net

I haven't used them but have heard good things.  Don't know if they only
deal with malware but am guessing they have a host of services.

I found a couple of services including ultimate security check which 
seem to be pretty good.

I noticed a lot of them recommend the same set of steps to harden WP - 
it begs the question, why doesn't Core do that automatically after ever 
upgrade (like deleting the install files, and locking down the wp-config 
file)?

Very true. I wrote a plugin called Plugin Register
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/plugin-register/) which in the
initial version automatically registered activations of my plugins.
Feedback made me change that policy pretty damn quickly.

If you want to know how people use your plugin make sure they are
fully aware of what data you are getting, and what it will be used
for.

Phoning home is also against repo guidelines so be careful.

Yet WordPress "phones home" itself.

Although we all know this - it isn't made clear anywhere for those that 
don't - with no simple admin option for turning it off.

Have always felt there should be a "no phone home" option in WP-Config...

Are there any upto date WordPress Books, that cover the settings API and that!

I have a plugin that's a bit bloated in size for what it does and want
to streamline it and reduce the amount of code contained within it as
its the settings API, and the validation checks that I would say are
approx 70% of the code.

yes, the book WordPress Plugin Development has include the Settings
API; i think the chapter is from Ozh
a mention http://wpengineer.com/2193/wpengineer-mentioned-in-wordpress-plugin-development-book/
Alternative a post from the author about the settings
api:http://wpengineer.com/2139/adding-settings-to-an-existing-page-using-the-settings-api/

But you find also more about this topic in www; also on plugins in the
wp repo, an example:
http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/addquicktag/trunk/inc/class-settings.php

Core, theme, and plugin update checks are not "phoning home". No statistics
or usage information is sent back to WordPress.org. In fact, it's
retrieving plugin/theme information from the site, not sending it back.

When did this change? It used to send version information + PHP &
MySQL info at the very least.

It if absolutely free PHP IDE.

I use Textmate in OS X. It has a fairly simple interface and hasn't let me
down yet. Netbeans and Komodo for Windows based developers is nice. I liked
Netbeans once I had it setup to my personal preference. As far as Notepad++
goes, it's better than nothing, but there are far better IDE's out there.

While not a full IDE, I've recently started using
http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-2-beta and absolutely
love it.  The inline search is extremely useful.

I've been using NetBeans for a small projects. It's really powerful.
I use also phpStorm ( http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/ ) because
it's much faster than NetBeans or Eclipse. It's absolutely the best
IDE I've ever seen. Unfortunately it's not free( EURO 94 for personal
license ).

+1 for PhpStorm, hands down the best IDE I've ever used. US$99 for personal license.

I'm also using PhpStorm, switched to it after Netbeans got buggy and
slow for my usage. Use it at home and work, on all my comps, very
happy with it!

Then it won't be long before some also brings up the topic of using shortcodes for content links. :)

Yes, that information is sent as part of the core update check. If you have
an older version of PHP or MySQL, for example, then you'll get a different
response from the core update check if the new version of WP doesn't
support your versions. Like in 3.0, when we started requiring PHP 5.

And from that request you can determine number of users running 
WordPress on number of platforms with an X configuration.

Is any other data sent? Or just PHP/MySQL Versions?

I'm afraid I would still call that dialling home - even if the data *is* 
very useful ...

Sending that data to the API site is fine, as long as that data isn't
then stored for stats.

IMO, if it is stored, there should be a checkbox during installation,
or a popup after upgrade to ask the users permission.

Before suggest this in Ideas, I want to ask you, there's no way to avoid plugins and themes to send all translation files with it?

I noticed that some themes and plugins comes with a bunch of translation files (i.e polldaddy) why not sent only the one matching the locale? At least for when downloading through WP panels.

Sorry if I'm saying non-sense :)

Any suggestions on the functions that will be used etc.

Given time, Language Packs will solve this, as translations will be
decoupled from plugins and themes.
Due to the way the plugin zip builder and API works, it's not feasable
to rewrite it and make a new zip for each language (which isn't always
stored in a consistent folder) given the changes LP will make over the
next year.

For Plugins, I agree, that they're mostly useless at present, but some
plugins use, and expect them to be present. As a result, the new Image
Headers on WordPress.org are stored in an assets folder instead of the
plugins folder, so that the extra images are not pushed to installs..
There'll probably be more enhancements on that in time, but in
general, screenshots can be compressed to ~50kb each as they're not
usually large images (and are only displayed as reasonably small
images), overall, they can make up a smaller percentage of the size
than you may think.

Hello Dion,
thanks for this reply and outlook.

Yes, i think the traffic for language and image files is often only a
small part; but more and more plugins have great documentation,readme
and screenshots on the wp-repo; its great and usefull.
Maybe its possible to add screenshots, only for this documentaion on
the repo to add to the assets folder; there is not in the focus of an
install.

Yes, too much screenshots are gret on plugin repo site but not in folders. 
Maybe someone could write a plugin for cleaning those files sigh...

It was discussed a long time ago on hackers, but I don't think it's
ever been officially documented: You can have the plugins directory
package up a subdirectory of your repo, rather than the whole thing.

http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/mdawaffe-test/trunk/

Notice the "Stable tag: trunk/plugin" in the readme file.  trunk/ is
the "stable tag" and is used to find the readme.txt and all screenshot
files, but the actual zip file will only contain the files found in
the plugin/ subdirectory.

http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/mdawaffe-test.zip

This addresses the screenshots issue, but not languages issue (since
they have to be in the package to be useful).

Sounds like the assets/ thing is a different (and simpler)
implementation of the same idea.

Hello all,

Just a quick question about the new wp_editor() function in WordPress 3.3.
I've implemented it into a few plugins and I've noticed that if a user is
not logged in they don't see the "add media" button. Is this intentional?
Looking at the documentation on WordPress.org, it seems that it should be
possible to show or hide the media upload buttons, but of course I could be
wrong. Has any one come across this before?

Thanks for taking the time to read this,

Kevin

Adding media items creates a new Post in the database. Without them being
logged in, they don't have an account and thus the post wouldn't have a
valid author or what have you. Dunno what problems that would create, but
there's more to media uploading than just uploading files.

Hey Otto,

Thanks a lot for the heads up. That makes sense, I was just curious of any
other users had noticed this and if so, what they had done about it.

Thanks again,

Ditto here. With BBedit, if you host your WordPress install locally,
you can edit and see the preview in real time.

That and Espresso for CSS editing.

Subject: [wp-hackers] The Loops plugin - feedback needed
Message-ID: <94FF6F9B-A28A-4692-8DBF-71313EB91150@gmail.com>

I just released a new version of the plugin The Loops and would like to get feedback from the community.

The Loops allows you to query the posts (and postmeta) table and display the result in your theme without writing any php code.
In short, it is an UI wrapper for WP_Query. (It is a would-be Drupal Views for WordPress ;)).
It can be downloaded from the repository: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/the-loops/.

The goals are:
- an easy to use UI
- a very powerful solution (99% of use-cases, I think current version already cover that)
- work out of the box with any theme
- easy to get started with (not plenty of shortcodes to learn, no modification to the theme files, etc. unlike other similar plugins)
- easy to extend/integrate with other plugins

What I would like to get feedback on:
- The concept: do you think the plugin is useful? why not? (I would really like to hear the arguments against)
- The UI: do you think it is friendly enough to use (especially for novice users)? do you see anything that could be improved?
- The custom template system : does it make sense? is it something you would implement in your themes? do you have a better idea?
- The code: do you have any suggestion to make it more extensible/flexible?
- Any feature suggestions.

Thanks for your time!

Ulrich

Subject: [wp-hackers] Quick question about sanitize_file_name
Message-ID: <CAH+NfoCH0aZm79uHmhwuxRKyYrf5SnMzWBzvkaj_p6V2D0xvQg@mail.gmail.com>

I've been trying to generate filenames for some uploaded files using
sanitize_file_name, and come across some weirdness when the string passed
to sanitize_file_name has curly quotes or apostrophes - they don't get
stripped out, which causes errors when using them as HTML entities.

Is this expected behaviour, or should the list of special characters be
expanded to include curly quotes?

Happy to open a trac ticket if its something overlooked... just wanted to
see if I'm doing something wrong first. (I worked around it by passing the
filename without extension through santizte_title_with_dashes, then adding
the extension and passing that through sanitize_file_name.)

You could trim the curly quotes from the filename string

Well, yes I could. But then I'd be wondering why I was using a function
called sanitize_file_name that didn't, you know, sanitize my file names.

Joking aside, I'm just wondering whether this is expected behavior -
leaving some characters in the file names - and if so, if its enough of an
issue for anyone else to bother writing a patch for.

Things like curly quotes are a PITA, but are probably allowed
characters in a filename. they just need to be encoded properly when
the image url is outputed.
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15955 should cover those issues.

BuddyPress has a friend feature and I believe you can view activity from 
those subscriptions.

It looks like it fires at the scheduled publish time, though I'd need to
test to confirm that.

I think you're asking the wrong crowd. This is not the sort of plugin that
a WP developer would use.

You should ask less technical users, your target audience, if it makes
sense to them.

Send a redirect. Including is the wrong answer.

Also, this sort of question is best placed in the WordPress.org forums
or perhaps even the WordPress StackExchange. Not appropriate for
wp-hackers.

No, sending a redirect is completely wrong.

Enable WP_DEBUG and you'll see whatever the PHP Error message is that
you're seeing.

Explain, if you please. I'm not understanding 1) why you would even
try to include index.php in home.php 2) why a redirect would be the
wrong answer.

Thanks.

Not sure of the context, but you could try the is_page() function.

If you didn't realise, this is a theming question, as theme files are
included by WordPress, redirecting to another theme file via a HTTP
redirect would never work.

As to why you'd include index.php from home.php, well, honestly, I
don't know what Sinan is attempting to achieve, and I don't question
what most themers are attempting to do, but that's not to say there
isn't a reason for it (for example, if a theme had a toggle to utilise
the page or not perhaps)

Sinan: The reason to enable debugging is so that you can see the error
produced by your code, if you're just receiving a blank page, it's
either a PHP Error, or you've got a blank index.php file.. which is
entirely possible..

Dion:
Thanks for that. I didn't have my head screwed on straight and see the
leap in logic I made.

Still don't see the logic in including index.php, though...

You need to fix your current errors before introducing more, or you'll
never find out which error is causing the undesired behaviour. Perhaps you
can go to the theme's author to ask.

Message-ID: <410D7F44-4260-43E6-81F5-3C64AAAE6408@oncefuture.com>

Is there are way to stop WP_query from returning posts when the term used in the 'tax_query' portion of the query does not exist? 

I'm querying against the slug field of multiple taxonomies. All works as expected when the term exists in any of the taxonomies. However, when the term used does not exist, WP_query omits the tax_query and continues to return the latest 10 posts.

I have wrap the query in a "if ( term_exists('someterm') )..."  to avoid this from happening but am hoping there is a better way.

Thanks,

-P-

What if you were to use get_template_part('index');

Subject: [wp-hackers] get_posts and new wp_query at same place and custom
	field
Message-ID: <003c01ccef39$9d4daeb0$0100a8c0@corpfe1f3cd943>

Hello,

I have a modified category.php using get_posts and new wp_query, not really if this is right.

get_posts() is getting and listing posts with meta_key and orderby meta_value etc working fine.

new wp_query get posts as usual but I'm trying to exclude the ones with empty meta_value. I tried everything and that just don't works. If I set to get a post with meta_value=2, works ok, but no meta_value='' or the _wp_zero_value, or meta_compare.

Maybe is not right to use get_posts and wp_query at same time?! The paginations is working, maybe that doesnt work together?!

Clarification:

I'm creating a theme for manage chapters, every category manage posts as usual and chapters if there is any chapter value. I need to list chapters and posts at same time but not all at the same listing stream.

Sinan, I hope you don't mind my saying so, but I think an explanation of 
what you are trying to achieve can help us better help you with your 
problem.

The way I see it, I believe you are trying to show different content 
based off something right? if 1 == 2 then show custom content. else, 
show content that'd normally be shown in the index.php page. So what 
you'd probably want to do would be to do a custom query that will spit 
out the same contents as what would have in in index.php..

anyhow, please explain "why" you are doing something and maybe we can 
better help you with the "how"

Hi there,

I think what you want to do is redirect the user to the index.php page. You
can redirect to another page with the header funtion:

<?php
header("Location: http://www.theonion.com/");
?>

This redirects to the onion.

If you're developing on your own computer the url would be something like:

<?php
header("Location:
http://loccalhost/directory_where_you_keep_your_wordpress_installtion/wordpress/index.php
");
?>

include() only make the code in the included file available in the file
that the include() appears in. It doesn't redirect you.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Taking over URL space
Message-ID: <871upofqyj.fsf@newcastle.ac.uk>


I was wondering whether someone could give me pointers in the right
direction. I'm not after a complete solution! I was just hoping that
someone with more knowledge of wordpress could tell me if I am heading
in the right way. 

I wanted to write a new plugin which returns metadata about posts in a
variety of different ways. To do this, I need to use various parts of
the URL space, but I don't know how best to do this. 


Essentially, I want to do three things. 

1) I would like to be able to use bits of the URL space from top level.
   So, for a wordpress at

http://mydomain.org.uk 

I would like to be able to serve all requests to..

http://mydomain.org.uk/myplugin

My initial idea was to achieve all this with rewrite rules, but
requiring users to modify .htaccess com. wp-rewrite seems the next
option -- I can just rewrite requests to this and underlying rewrite 
plugin php? 


2) I want to add support for file extension based access. So for a
URL such as 

http://mydomain.org.uk/?p=46

I'd like requests to 

http://mydomain.org.uk/?p=46.bib

to be handled by my plugin, probably by sending the browser straight to
a URL of the http://mydomain.org.uk/myplugin. I am not sure how well
this would interact with pretty permalinks -- something of the form

http://mydomain.org.uk/2012/02/02/mypost/ 

looks daft with an extension
http://mydomain.org.uk/2012/02/02/mypost/.bib

However, as far as I can see this is a similar problem to the last. 

3) 

And, finally, I'd like to provide a content negotiated solution. So
requests to:

http://mydomain.org.uk/?p=46

will return different results depending on the content type in the
Accept: header of the request; again, this will probably be implemented
by forwarding the browser. 

This one seems to be the most taxing -- I can't do this with rewrite
rules because it is the same in all cases. 

Any pointers gratefully received!

Phil

Not sure about 3, but I would handle 1 and 2 with the same mechanism. For
#2, I'd just check to see if there's a file extension at the end of the
URL. Something like is working for me now:

You need to add_rewrite_tag for each variable/piece of data you want to
read from the query string. Then you can use those when adding your rewrite
rule. To actually *do something* with that, you can hook into
template_redirect and check to see if your query var(s) are set and if so,
do something. If you want to output something like a CSV or other file, you
can just set your header (including content-disposition!) properly, dump
your text out, and exit().

Also, after you activate your plugin, you will need to manually flush your
rewrite rules by going into your permalink settings and clicking the Save
button for the rewrites to start working.

<?php

    function myplugin_add_rewrites() {
        add_rewrite_tag('%my_plugin_init%','([^&]+)');
        add_rewrite_tag('%my_variable%','([^&]+)');

        add_rewrite_rule('myplugin/([^/]*)/?
','index.php?my_plugin_init=1&my_variable=$matches[1]','top'); // so,
myblog.com/myplugin/some_data will give you my_plugin_init =1 and
my_variable = "some_data" when you do_something() below.
    }
    add_action('init', 'myplugin_add_rewrites');


    function myplugin_do_something() {
        $my_plugin_init = (boolean) get_query_var('my_plugin_init');
        $my_variable = get_query_var('my_variable');

        if(!$my_plugin_init) return; // 'myplugin' wasn't found in our URL

        //do something here...
        //you can dump data out to the browser or set a header() to
redirect, just make sure you exit() when you're done if you do, unless you
also want WP to render whatever post/page should be rendered.
    }
    add_action('template_redirect', 'myplugin_do_something');
?>

Probably a little vague. I have very, very similar code in place and
working right now that took a ton of trial and error to work out. Tinker
with this a little bit and if you have more questions, let me know.

Hope that helps!

3 is the same idea. Write a function to catch the headers from*$_SERVER* 
or use function *getallheaders()*. And then redirect requests to 
different handlers(template pages). Hook this function to 
'template_redirect' or 'init' actions.

Here is another way to have new rules without using add_rewrite_rule:

add_action( 'generate_rewrite_rules', 'my_rewrite_rules' );

function my_rewrite_rules(){
     global $wp_rewrite;
     $rules = array(
         'myplugin/?$' => 'index.php?myplugin=1'
     )
     $wp_rewrite->rules =array_merge($rules,$wp_rewrite->rules);
}

For using extensions on p, something like this could work:

add_action('parse_request','my_parse_request' );

function my_parse_request( &$request ) {
     $post_id = $request->query_vars['p'];
     // check if the post id has an extension
     // also check the "Accept:" header
     // add a new query_var for the extension, and change "p" variable 
back to an id
}

However adding a new query_var for extension would be needed either way.

add_filter( 'query_vars, 'my_query_vars' );

function my_query_vars( $query_vars ){
     $query_vars[] = 'myplugin';
     $query_vars[] = 'ext';
     return $query_vars;
}

And then at the template redirect check for both the myplugin and ext 
query_vars and then have your plugin handle those.

This is indeed a very strange request.

What you would want to do is use a _GET value in the url in the post
(href="#?alter_title_for_some_reason=alternate+title"), and check for it
elsewhere in the code, probably in a callback attached to init like:

add_action('init', 'x_detect_strange_title_altering_link');

In that function you would add a filter to the_title to use the alternate
text.

Trying to insert the logic to detect the link click inside the post is
insane. If you are trying to do that you should completely re-assess your
goals and find a whole new path to achieve them. Ultimately I don't think
there's a good reason for what you're doing anyway, there should only be
one TITLE for any given piece of content. Trying to fool Google with
something like this is more likely to get your pagerank punished than
rewarded.

It won't help in this particular case.

if a page url is like this

.com/permalink/page

I want to have some db activity in ( where the the_content) is outputted.

Basically, that section will check if querystring variables
"recid_from" and "recid_to" are passed in the querystring; so if the
url is as follows

.com/permalink/page?recid_from=10&recid_to=20

It will go ahead and look up those records in some custom table and
display it where the_content() would normally be outputted

generated links there could be as follows;

<a href='...com/permalink/page?recid=10'>title 10</a>
<a href='...com/permalink/page?recid=11'>title 11</a>
<a href='...com/permalink/page?recid=12'>title 12</a>
...

And as the user clicks on one of those links, again the same page will
reload and this time a detailed view will be brought up of that
specific record.

In that case, if the url is as follows;

...com/permalink/page?recid=10

the_content will be querying that database table for recid 10 and display it.

That's where the need comes to display the title accordingly.

Since all this time we are in this url > .com/permalink/page

the title is whatever the "page" title is wp_posts

but in this particular situation, that title is only good when no
querystring is attached to it.

as soon as recid this, recid that is accompanied that url, i want
different titles to be displayed not only at html title but also in
page titles.

I'm working on a proof of concept, this is not a real app or need per se.

As to the google, google would never punish you for having different
titles when the url is different.

The only way I can think of this being possible is thru ob_buffer.

By the time, the_content kicks in ( the title has long been computed
by wp ) and there is no hook to go back in time and change it.

You need to detect the query strings in the url early on in the process as
previously demonstrated to you. Do that with a template_redirect hook in
your theme's functions.php
But to do your actual processing, create a page template and fill that with
your display code, assign that template to your special page.

So:
* on the template_include hook detect your query vars,
* if detected query your db, calculate your title (cache the db results)
* set up the_title filter to return your desired title OR just add some
code to header.php to use your different title
*in the page template, output the results of your earlier db query.

Thanks Mike.
With your solution though, when I switch themes, wouldn't all that
custom programming ( querying the db to get the record data / title
etc ) be not accessible?

The reason I was putting the php code right there where the exec_php
runs ( that is the_content section ) was to store this in the wp_posts
as content so that when I switch themes, no matter whivh theme I
switch to the output of ...com/permalink/page would be the same -
except theme specific cosmetics.

But could the issue I'm raising with this be addressed by making sure
all themes functions.php **include** a generic_functions.php from the
wp root so those hooks kick in across the board?

Subject: [wp-hackers] prefix vs postfix - pros and cons
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2JSM7hR0Gr7ZjFTnO7iZ=AbOomic6fC9hDJXgkEOptKg@mail.gmail.com>

when building a framework of library  functions, and you need to make
sure your function and variable/constant names will not get mixed up
by people's custom code, which way would you go? prefix your
functions?, or postfix them?

I'm building a library of php functions ( expected to be around 200
functions or so ) to ease my day to day operations and I need to adopt
a style.
I would like to pick your brains. My library will be called blueprint,
so the prefix/postfix would be either bp_ or _bp. Which one is better?

example leftof functiond, takes a string and returns the leftof what's
passed as substring.

so, ahuold this leftof functions be preifxed as

bp_leftof($string,$substring)

or postfixed as

leftof_bp($string,$substring)

it appears to me that the latter is more effective because of two reasons

one is intellisense... the moment you type in "ins" for insert, you
get your dropdown instantly. In the prefix approach, the first 3 chars
gets me no where.

secondly, when think of an action, you think of it directly, insert a
record, or list records, etc. So, you'd instinctively go for typing
that action such as insert_record,  rather than
something_insert_record.

The only advantage I see in prefixing is that in a functions list (
where your frameworks' functions mixed up with other frameworks), you
can see that your library of functions are all lumped together when
sorted alphabetically. But practically speaking, I don't see much
benefit to that.

When it comes to file naming convetions, I'd go for prefix though. But
it has its own dynamics, in file operations, alphabetical sorting is
practical.

My question is on specifically function and variable names which are
typed/thought a lot.

So,

bp_leftof($string,$substring)

or

leftof_bp($string,$substring)

Thanks

I assume this is for use within a WordPress system, yes? In which case
be aware that BuddyPress uses a bp_* convention for many of its
internal methods. Therefore your *_bp convention would be better.

Yes you are right; and that is the criteria I use for choosing whether code
should go in functions.php or a plugin: "If I want to change themes, will
it break?"

So in this case the answer is "yes", so you need to put that code in a
plugin:

The template_redirect hook,
And the db access and display functions.
Add a hook for wp_title
add a hook for the_title
add a hook for 'the_content', that calls your display functions.
That way, any theme that calls the_content on your page will be get your
display output.

It was quicker to knock up an example than to explain the details. See

Hope that helps.

I would suggest that using *full slugs* rather than acronyms is better
still: i.e. blueprint_ vs bp_.

And it probably doesn't make a difference, but most things in the WordPress
ecosystem seem to tend to prefix rather than postfix.

Thank you for catching that. I did not know about buddypress's bp_.

but, I was asking in general, not particularly in wp. The library and
the functionality I'm trying to build should work also in drupal,
joomla etc.

In general, what are the advantages of prefixing the function names as
opposed to postfixing them?

Or we can make the question more wordpressy... why did wordpress opt
in for prefix as oppsed to postfix? was it the result of a thinking
process or was it just hey , it don't matter.. wp_ looks good type
thing?

An obvious one is sorting. Any IDE or other tool that lists functions, or
automatically completes your typing based on what you typed so far would
have an advantage with a prefix. All the related functions will be together.

You could use a PHP class with your custom functions in it. Use the
class name ...

bp_Custom_Functions::debug( $args );


... or use "new":

$custom = new bp_Custom_Functions();

$custom->debug( $args );


class bp_Custom_Functions {

     function debug( $args ) {
         wp_die( '<pre>' . var_export( $args, true ) . '</pre>' );
     }

     // ...
}

Watch out for short 2 letter prefixes. since they'll be more popular 
like "bp" for buddypress.

anyway, it doesn't matter.

wp using prefix instead of postfix is most probably due to convention 
first of all. because everybody usually does it that way. In fact I'm 
pretty sure they didn't even think about which they should use, prefix 
or postfix, because its assumed. I'm not saying that just because the 
majority does it then it must be right. but what I'm trying to say is 
that this is one of those things where following convention is overall 
more beneficial coz I don't really think the benefits from either prefix 
or postfix matter much. Just like using dashes or camel case. or 
capitalizing the first letter of classes and methods not.

THis is where "go with whatever the team feels comfortable in using" and 
in if you are developing a library that you're planning to release to 
the wp community then your team would be the community who by convention 
will be used to prefix. actually most programmers would probably be used 
to prefix..

This may be a bit of a stretch for wp-hackers but I can't think of (or
find) a more relevant place to pose this question.

About 3-4 years ago I built a couple themes based on Sandbox.  Instead of
depending on Sandbox as a parent theme, I included Sandbox into my theme
development area using an SVN external reference.  This worked well, my
theme was stand-alone and I didn't have to answer any questions about why
it wouldn't work because the parent theme wasn't present.  The theme itself
included most of the Sanbox files (in fact all but 2 or 3) by "including"
them.  Essentially I created a new file (e.g. author.php) which referenced
the original corresponding Sandbox file (e.g. my author.php did little more
than contain the statement "require('sandbox/author.php');).  Some of the
files (e.g. functions.php and header.php) added more code and functionality
and represent the bulk of my theme's functionality which sits on top of
Sandbox.

Fast forward a few years and things have changed.  I really want to develop
a new theme but in the interest of time, I need to update the current one
to be compatible with WordPress 3.3 and PHP 5.3.  I've incorporated all of
the changes (how options are stored, updated jQuery, Nav Menus, etc.) and
everything seems to be working pretty well.

However, the move to PHP 5.3 has exposed some issues in the original
Sandbox code that PHP now complains about.  These are all fairly easy to
fix but I am not sure how best to fix them.  I don't know enough about
Subversion to know  if there is a way to keep my reference to Sandbox using
the SVN external reference while still allowing me to "locally" update 1-2
files and then SVN export the result so everything works correctly.

What I am doing is similar but not the same as the Vendor Branch concept
covered in the Subversion book.

Any suggestions or pointers to articles would greatly be appreciated.

I can't see any reasons why you cant fork sandbox and send an email to the  
original author mentioning your issue.
If he cares, he will reply back, if not, life goes on.

Why not patch Sandbox, and then contribute the fixes back up-stream to
Sandbox?

Subject: [wp-hackers] register_sidebar()
Message-ID: <CALri7MnrbhtAUUC5yA8t1ebfSaTuA2=s0BFni5vf1x9vw-v=vw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to WP but I have a few PHP skills and I am hacking on a theme
called PageLines.

With that said...

I'm creating two new "sections" to display a top and bottom
leaderboard for ads. These sections will be NOT in the sidebar. :)

I'm at the point in my code where I use:

register_sidebar()

Would I still use the above method even if my section/widget content
will never be in a physical sidebar (I'm talking about HTML sidebar on
the front end theme template)?

I know that's probably a silly question, but I just want to make sure
I using the right method. Maybe the name "sidebar" is throwing me off?
Is there another method for registering non-sidebar sections?

Hopefully I'm not asking a total noob question... I figured I would
have better luck asking here than on the WP forums (anyway, I like
e-mail listservs and I plan on hacking more in the future.) :D

Thanks so much!

Cheers,
Micky

Hi Micky,
Basicallly, Widget Area's used to be pretty much only sidebars.. and
so, the name register_sidebar() was used inline with the other
*_sidebar() functions.

use register_sidebar() to register a "Widget Area", be that a footer,
header, sidebar, 2nd sidebar, below-post-widget-area, or perhaps a
pop-over ad-widget-sidebar (that luckely i've never seen...)

so yes, It's just the name throwing you.

Cheers
D

Hello,

remember that PHP( >=5.3 ) has already namespaces (
http://php.net/manual/pl/language.namespaces.php ). Unfortunately php
5.3 is still not so popular so I prefer prefixes.

This would be my preferred approach as I've done this with some other
plugins.  In this case, I've tried to contact the owner of the Google Code
repository (Scott Walick) and never gotten a response.  For all practical
purposes, Sandbox appears to have been abandoned, at least that is what it
looks like to me.

That said, it does appear that the WordPress.com theme repository has a
newer version of Sandbox (1.6.2) that the version I have been using from
Google Code.

https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/sandbox-162/

Unfortunately this version has the same errors (uninitialized variables)
that the older version has so while it has some updates, it still doesn't
fix my problem.

Can I submit a patch for this theme the same way I'd submit one for
WordPress?

For now I guess I will just keep a local copy of the file I modified and
use that, I was hoping there was some clever way to apply my change to the
imported file and keep it all in my theme's Subversion repository.

The sandbox theme (and it's brethren) were officially abandoned at least a
couple of years ago ( http://www.plaintxt.org/ ).

As far as I recall, 1.6.2 had an important security fix in it that wasn't
present in the Google code version.

I used to use Sandbox as a good basis for themes a long time ago, but
abandoned it not longer after the author did. Some of it's best ideas are
now incorporated into core WordPress, but the rest of WordPress'
functionality has left it far, far behind.

There are many better themes to build on. TwentyTen and TwentyEleven were
both built to be exemplar themes using all the latest APIs and techniques
from core WordPress, for example.

Whilst they are bit too designed for some tastes, strip the stylesheet and
you have a very good starting point.

I completely agree with you but I am looking at making a short term fix to
allow me some time to build a replacement theme.  I am doing this as a
hobby so my time to work on this comes and goes depending on my real job,
family commitments, etc.  If I focused on it I could probably build a new
theme in a few weeks time but it will likely take me 2-3 months working on
it an hour here and there as time permits.

There is a lot of value (to me) in moving to the latest WordPress release
and a lot of value (to the end users) who know how to use the existing
theme so spending a few hours updating what is currently a known quantity
will provide me a decent short term solution.

For now I think I am going to keep a modified version of the functions.php
file as part of my theme code and include the 1.6.2 code from the
WordPress.com theme repository.

I saw that the other day I've already started looking at it.  I need to
finish my short term solution before I can look at it in earnest though.

I have a feeling for this use-case a [shortcode] would work better. Indeed
all the logic should be in a plugin rather than the theme, but define a
shortcode instead of filtering all the_content, so that it only applies to
pages where you actually want it (likely a single page).

I described a plugin (and wrote) so that it would work with any theme. And
my example only filters the content where it is needed.

I will consider your valuable ideas...   but I was still wondering
what would be a problem if we'd go with an "ob_start" implementation,
that is straight forward.

Here is one plan...

Create a a plugin ( that hooks to the init ) whose job is to detect if
the page url contains one of those querystring variables that my
framework uses.

If the url is such, then the plugin runs the ob_start. ( Now we know,
we can have control over the_title whenever we want to. )

With that in mind, in the the_content, we use exec_php to do whatever
we want to do, that is contacting the db's getting the current title
for that recid and so on. Obviously, all this code is stored in the
wp_posts and therefore, theme independent.

And then we take an advantage the fact that the ob_start is on and
therefore, we use the ob_get_contents(), do a replacement on the
already computed html and page title, and finally use ob_end_flush()
to seal the deal.

Could you comment what the issues would be with this approach?

Thanks

Absolutely the *wrong* way to do it!

If you hook around template_redirect or earlier, then you can check the
query string and set up a hook on wp_title without having to do any
buffering or search and replace. Instead of being able to change what
wp_title outputs, you simply make it output the correct thing.
Similarly you can hook on the_title and the_content, again no search and
replace needed.

Using output buffering you are hoping to modify what WordPress has already
done to change it after the fact and make it say what you want.

Using the methods I've already described, you just make it say what you
want in the first place.

All the code in a plugin is theme independent too. Seriously, there has
been no need to use exec_php for several years!

As above, just plain wrong.

Did you look at my code? It actually works, I spent the time to give you a
working example. It's not pseudo code.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Help with mime types
Message-ID: <CADqS_axVS4VD2EF40qKoeppGvP_98wNYaK6uzJx4_jcwoJFdyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello people!

I need to allow *.SWF* file upload in my WordPress instalation for my
banners system.

I have tried this (without success):

function new_mime_types($mimes) {
    if( ! isset( $mimes['flash'] ) ) $mimes['flash'] = 'application/
x-shockwave-flash';

    return $mimes;
}

add_filter('upload_mimes', 'new_mime_types');

Somebody can help me?


Thanks! =)

You'll need to make the swf filetype to the mime as well, how you do
that, i'm not sure off the top of my head.
it might just mean replacing 'flash' with 'swf' in the below code, or
it might be another filter.
Eitherway, check out this plugin:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pjw-mime-config/ (at least for the
hooks it uses)

Hi Dion.

Really sorry my mistake!

I replaced *flash *with *swf *and it works now!

Very thank you! =)

Message-ID: <BD627C078DB14BFBAD249ED6A19FDA85@gmail.com>

I am Ankur Anand, a student from India.. While working on the theme for my blog, i thought of an idea to provide a 'Design in the Browser' approach to designing or customizing a Wordpress theme. 

The idea is to use a Firebug (http://getfirebug.com/)/Firefox Inspect (http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2012/01/31/firefox-adds-powerful-new-developer-tools/) interface to make changes to the CSS of the elements loaded, and then upload the changes back to the server. The main idea is to provide a tool which lets us edit the CSS Live in the browser and then save the changes. 
Here is the overview of the idea : http://ankuranand.in/blog/2012/02/rethinking-wordpress-theme-editor/.
Also, i have added mockups and detailed explanation of the idea and the features. http://ankuranand.in/blog/2012/02/rethinking-wordpress-theme-editor-part-2/. 

I have already started working on the project, and needed suggestions from the community members over the design, features and implementation of the idea.I wanted to do this as a Google Summer of Code project.

There is already a project like that,  http://www.webputty.net/
Working great as well :)

Sorry to spoil your ideas :/

When using Firefox I use the Web Developer extension for exactly that
purpose, only a bit more manually.

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/

Basically you can edit the CSS live and see the changes. Once I'm
satisfied, I can just select-all, copy, paste into the theme editor,
and save. Not the most efficient means of saving, but it does the job.

BTW that was meant totally for fun, not sarcasm.  I could definitely 
hear Otto's deep voice

@kokarn and @otto,
I agree that there are workarounds and tools to deal with the issue of
saving the changes made through firebug or similar tools, but as i have
mentioned in my blog(in the section - why another firebug ? )  also, that a
tool like firebug is only the first step to it.
The whole idea is to extend it further to provide more flexibility in
editing and providing a better user experience for the process, and not
just an interface to edit the CSS rules.
Another way i think the project is very useful is that having such
functionalities exposed to other developers would help in extending the
idea further and into more useful tools, where they can integrate the
functionalities of this project into their extensions.
I can not give the whole overview of the idea in the mail as it would
become too long and difficult to read, is why i have written the posts.
Thanks.

Subject: [wp-hackers] mysql ssl connection?
Message-ID: <CAJ5Hi2jwLzTUP4zcM-kxPyzQk5ePoDb31b9sPMB0XiGqbQr73g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm working on a setup where Apache and php is installed on one server
while mysql is configured on a second server on the same network. I
have been able to get mysql setup to use ssl when connecting to the
database.

My question is, how would I go about getting wordpress to connect to
the database over ssl?

(please note that I am not 100% sure if it a wordpress thing or I need
to set it up on the php.ini file)

WordPress itself doesn't support setting the connection to SSL,
however, it does offer the ability to use a different Database engine
through the usage of the wp-content/db.php dropins.

As a result, It's possible to create a new DB class which does support
the MySQL SSL constant.

I've just done so, and I tried testing, but, even with the SSL
constant set as the PHP manual says.. it connected to my non-ssl mysql
instance without fault.. So i've got no idea if it just falls back to
non-ssl, or if there was something wrong with the mysql_connect()
command.

It's based on the trunk database file, and altered slightly to account
for the missing functions.. as a result, if it fails to connect to the
server, you won't get the WordPressy message, you'll just get my lame
error message. Feel free to customise as you see fit.

here's the file you'll need to place in wp-content/db.php:

Hi Dion,

Thank-you for getting back to me. I'm going to take a look at this and
see if I can get it to work. My understanding is that I may need to
tell the client app ( in this case, wordpress) to use a certificate
like I did when connecting to the mysql server via ssh.

Thank-you Dion :)

If you need to tell it to use a Certificate, I think that'll be set
within the local MySQL connection settings, but it'll also have to be
backed up by PHP(WordPress) asking for the SSL connection in the first
place (my code)

If you've got it working for command line MySQL, just give the PHP
option a shot, and see if it picks up the system mysql config.. If it
doesn't, it might be that you can't use the mysql_* set of functions,
and instead need to use mysqli instead, which is a whole different
kettle of fish, and i'd suggest questioning if you can't just secure
the network between the machines, rather than the connection instead..

Drecode, I commented on your blog but for some reason the comment never got
listed. Maybe because it had a link to a github repo.

I think there is room for a plugin that does something like this and it's a
project I'm working on (slowly).

I have only been toying with the live editing idea this morning but I think
I've come up with a plan. Why create a new firebug when you could just
monitor what the current firebug is doing and send that to the server.
Heck, use Chrome monitor if that's your flava. I think the key is, monitor
css changes on your webpage (client side javascript)  and push that to the
server. For authenticated users obviously.

I'm looking at adding this to the editor I'm working on. So changes to a
css file in the editor automatically get pushed to the live webpage (in
another tab/window). Likewise changes to the live webpage done using
firebug/inspector get pushed to the editor live. This is all done
clientside by the way. Then you would save the file from within the IDE
when you're ready.

That's the plan/dream.

V1 of WPide is in the WP repo.

v2dev branch can be found on github
https://github.com/WPsites/WPide/tree/v2dev

It isn't finished but it does work. No live editing has been added to
either of those repo's yet though.

Feel free to get involved.

Simon

Actually i plan to do some changes in the editing process also which would provide a better flow in the editing process itself, is why i need to do it again. Also, since i want to integrate all the functionalities in Wordpress so as to expose them to other developers needing functions to change the appearance of the website, i wanted to write the code with that objective in mind. 
With this idea, i think it makes more sense to re-write the code for editing process, not to say it would make it independent of these tools ( which has its own small advantages).

Hi list members,

I stumbled upon this Q on WPSE<http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/43560/how-do-i-rename-the-wp-admin-folder-with-the-admin-url-filter#comment55078_43560>. 
I found it interesting, but never tried it myself, so I have no starting

1) Is it actually possible to change the /wp-admin directory name?
2) Is it the correct way he's trying it?
3) Where should he start debugging?

Best wishes,

Put simply: You can't.

Longer answer: You can hack around things, and get it working, but
you'll loose all ability to upgrade without issue (potentially causing
security issues thanks to running an out of date version), you'll
loose access to certain plugins that rely on /wp-admin/, you'll
potentially loose styling when images are embedded in some
stylesheets, etc.

puclic_html/wordpress-trunk$ grep -r wp-admin * | grep -v '\.svn' |
grep -v 'wp-content' | grep '\.php'
provides 498 good reasons not to attempt it.

I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm just saying WordPress doesn't
support it, and that it's a waste of your time attempting it.
Both from a "you can do it" perspective, AND from a security
perspective, it's going to provide little protection, given the
alternatives available (proper passwords.. SSL, .htaccess HTTP
Authentication, combination of all of the previous.. etc)

Hello people!

Is there a way to disable "auto-draft" posts?

When I enter to post-new.php page, WordPress creates a post record in
wp_posts table, with status "auto-draft". Even if the post is not saved, WP
keeps the record created.

I think it's bad....

I really appreciate any comment about it...

Drika Hi, actually I believe that disabling the automatic draft is not
the ideal solution, but to getWordPress to generate it only when some
information is changed in the post and not just whenwe entered the screen
to add a new post because this can generate a lot of garbage in the
database.

To put the discussion on this subject started here:
http://groups.google.com/group/wordpress-brasil/browse_thread/thread/95d3def023d860f3

I know that few will be able to follow since the list is in Portuguese in
Brazil, it happens that was developing a METABOX on a website
and needed more than once to access the page thatadds a new post to see if
everything was ok with the listing of the data in dropboxes and other
things, this is a new installation with virtually no content, but when
I see the wp-posts table hadalmost 100 records, was when I realized that
once we get to add new post WordPress creates the record in
the database even if we do nothing more.

This can generate a lot of garbage in the database and in sites with many
users and contentcan even stifle the process.

Any solution in order to generate this record only when you
really get a post to be created?

I suspect if you removed support for 'revisions' that would stop happening,
but I could be totally wrong. Of course, you would also lose support for
storing multiple revisions of your posts. :)

If you want to try it out, this should do the trick:
<?php remove_post_type_support( 'post', 'revisions' ); ?>

Again, just a hunch, but it's easy to try it out.

Auto-drafts are automatically deleted after 7 days of going unused.
They're self-cleaning, basically. No need to worry about them.

They also go away when the first auto-save occurs while writing a new
post. So the only way they hang around is if you enter the post-new
screen, then leave it. The auto-draft will remain for up to 7 days,
then get deleted when you enter the post-new screen again.

A post has to exist for it to be edited, so the auto-draft fills the
hole between you entering post-new and the autosave occurring after
you enter the title of the post.

No, that wouldn't work.

Auto-drafts exist because of the fact that multiple users can create
new posts at the same time. If two people enter post-new at roughly
the same moment, then have their first autosaves occur nearly
simultaneously, then there is a race condition that can cause one of
them to get back the wrong post ID, which will cause a post to be
overwritten/lost when they then continue editing the post.

The auto-draft creates the post and gets the ID of the new post before
the editing screen is displayed, thus preventing two simultaneous
authors from accidentally having the same post ID in the data in their
browser.

Otto,

Appreciate the input on how drafts are cleaned up.  7 days seems like a long
time for an auto save draft to live but it's good to know this and that
cleaning does occur.

As for having to create the post to get the PostID, why not just generate a
PostID, put it into the Post form and then use it when the author saves the
Post, as opposed to actually saving the Post first?  I'm assuming there is a
downside somewhere but it would remove the need to have auto drafts (for
this purpose), remove the need to clean and remove some DB/comm overhead.

Cheers,

Jeff

It's done this way so, for example, you have access to the $post
object for new posts before they've been saved. As for your
suggestion, you can only generate a valid post ID by inserting a row
into the posts table, which is what WordPress does.

On a similar note, WordPress used to generate post IDs for new posts
without inserting a row into the posts table. It generated negative
post IDs, which were then changed when the post was saved. The current
system is much more robust.

Figured it was something like this.  I've created client/server apps in the
past where we had functions that would be called to generate an ID for a
given table without actually inserting a row in that table.  Different
beast.  Makes sense that you might have some RI issues if there are other
WordPress features that need the row in wp_posts.

Cheers, Jeff

Subject: [wp-hackers] sql injection protected included?
Message-ID: <4F4D1444.8060402@gmail.com>

Hi,

I was looking at this plugin's file[1] and I was a bit surprised about 
it not using wpdb->prepare() for escaping user input in db queries.

I've tried to abuse this (proving this plugin contains a mistake and fix 
it), but failed.

It seems that WordPress is using it's own version of magic_quotes() 
called wp_magic_quotes() in wp-includes/load.php to actively prevent 
single quotes from being used in the wpdb->query()? Btw I'm sure 
magic_quotes() is off in my php.ini (although I do use the Suhosin 
Path). I'm using PHP 5.3.5.

So why bother with wpdb->prepare() or any other higher level escape 
functions if WordPress is already (partially?) taken care of this?

Just wondering, if some other people could have a look at this and 
perhaps enlighten me on sql injection protection and best practices (for 
WordPress plugins) given that I was under the impression one should 
always escape user input.

Thanks in advance,

Grtz

I don't know the reasoning behind the 7 day timer. Long enough to work
for all sane cases, not long enough to be annoying. It would break if
you opened a browser, went to post-new, then left the browser open and
didn't write anything for 7 days straight, then came back and tried to
write something.

Even if it did this, it would need a way to reserve that post ID
number and not hand it out to any other clients. Introducing a new
field somewhere to hold the latest post ID just moves the race
condition to a different place, it doesn't fix it. Creating the new
row and relying on the database to be consistent and durable is the
only way to do it.

If the next-valid-post-ID was stored somewhere else (say in an options
row), then getting it would involve a) selecting the row and b)
updating it to have the next number since we're taking this one. A
race condition occurs when two separate processes both select the row
simultaneously, before the update can happen.

Creating the new row and letting the DB decide on the post ID number
(it's an auto-increment field), then getting that row number, is the
only way to eliminate the condition. Even if two nearly-simultaneous
processes create new rows, the database itself will assign them post
ID's, ensuring that they cannot be the same.

Yes, that is an SQL injection and it is exploitable. The plugin has
been closed, the author will be contacted.

In the future, please don't make security issues like this public
immediately. Contact plugins at wordpress.org or security at wordpress.org
first.

This also makes it possible to upload images before the first draft is 
saved and they will be properly attached to the new post.

I apologize for not contacting the mentioned addresses, I wasn't sure if 
the plugin was indeed insecure or if I was just seeing ghosts. In the 
future I will contact the mentioned addresses even if I'm not 100% sure.

Thanks for your quick reply and action!

Apologies for going off topic, but are there resources showing ( possibly
demonstrably) how wordpress tackles and reacts to security issues?

It must be a common issue for companies that use open source resources,
relying heavily on the community to make sure application development and
incident reporting is handled appropriately?

Eg i might feel comfortable contributing to fix a php or wordpress issue,
but i am completely dependent on ubuntu to handle that for my servers.

Hi,

When writing ExpressionEngine plugins, there's this at the top:

if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

Could I include something similar in a WP plugin?

Just curious.

Thanks!
Micky

Yes.

An equivalent would be along the lines of:

if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) die( 'No direct access allowed' );

Andrew, well remembered. I believe that it happened in the new versions, I
had a customer who complained that the pictures posted by him were not
linked to the post and that was because it was enclosed the picture right
away.

I believe in older versions of WP only kept on the bench when he wrote the
title for example.

Why don't you put wp-admin into a subdomain, and block the access to the 
main domain of wp-admin?
I use this method in one of my wordpress site, and all admin features 
work fine. Check here

Showing... Kind of.

I mean there's http://codex.wordpress.org/Security_FAQ but I don't think that's what you're looking for. You're thinking like a MS level of vulnerability disclosures, right?

Maybe you'd want to fix the type in the grep command?  I'm sure you meant
"public_html" not "puclic" :)

luckily that wasn't part of the grep, and was just a manually-entered
command-line prefix ;) - But who's to say I don't name it puclic_html?
:)
(As a side note, wow, there's a lot of results for that in google...
plenty of people like me who can't spell!)

Does that code work?

I use

define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', false);

added to the wp-config.php file.

Also use the plugin wp optimize which amongst other features deletes
the revisions and the drafts. After disbaling revisons the current
revisons are still held in the database, so ideally need deleting.

I was using one of the related posts plugins that hadn't been updated
for a while and it was pulling the revisons from the database as
related posts which was inconvenient :-)

The revisons can really add up to a lot of database entries, I have a
site with tens of thousands of posts and a plugin that updated the
posts at random (gave them the current date, pushing them to the top
of categories etc...) it was generating loads of revisons!

Yes, that's the gist of it. Something in between a single line saying to
email plugins and a full on MSRC web site.

And then before that, at the development stage, are there procedures,
techniques, e.t.c. that (the core team) use when creating new versions that
show how they attempt to tackle issues pre-emptively.

Hope I've expressed that clearly.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Changing post "redirect" after save
Message-ID: <CAHG1zgh5Ge7K_xrv7n6Obbb4qQBB3jc02N9LREoVivMENgLriQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm developing a custom plugin for a client.
The plugin has CTP of question that includes the answer as a metadata.
The question is plublished using a public form and wp_insert_post while the
actual site authors can answer it (edit the proper field)

One of the requirements is that once an author answered a question, he will
be redirected to the next 'unanswered' question.
So I need a way change the redirection 'target' of 'save_post' after
everything was saved...

Any idea ?

Thanks
Hannit

Thanks all for the comments. I have been trying these out, and with info
from the WPrewrite documentation but can't get them to work. 


My plugin (complete with debug printouts!) looks like below. I have the
template_redirect section working fine. I have a rule flusher on
wp_loaded. The codex mentions this not as a long term solution because
it's compute intensive. 

Then I have a generate_rewrite_rules filter. As far as I can tell it's
never been called. 

I would like to try the add_rewrite_rule/add_rewrite_tag method, but I
don't understand this. What are these two methods doing? 

Phil



add_action( 'wp_loaded','my_flush_rules' );

// flush_rules() if our rules are not yet included
function my_flush_rules(){
    print( time() + "\n" );
    print( "4: my flush rules\n" );
	$rules = get_option( 'rewrite_rules' );

	if ( ! isset( $rules['test'] ) ) {
        print( "2: isset\n" );
		global $wp_rewrite;
	   	$wp_rewrite->flush_rules();
	}
}


add_filter( 'generate_rewrite_rules','test_phil_insert_rewrite_rules' );

// Adding a new rule --- never called
function test_phil_insert_rewrite_rules( $wp_review )
{
    print( "insert rewrite rules\n" );
	$newrules = array 
        (
         "test" => 'index.php?test-plugin=1&hello-world=1',
         );
	
	return $newrules + $rules;
}



// this bit is working
add_filter( 'query_vars', 'test_query_vars' );

function test_query_vars( $query_vars ){
    print( "test_query_vars\n" );
    $query_vars[] = "test-plugin";
    $query_vars[] = "hello-world";

    return $query_vars;
}


// this bit handles the request and it is working
// as http://localhost/?test-plugin=1&hello-world=1 returns hello world
function test_plugin_hello(){
    print( "test_plugin_hello" );
    $test_plugin = (boolean) get_query_var( 'test-plugin' );
    $hello_world = (boolean) get_query_var( 'hello-world' );
    if( !$test_plugin ) return;

    print( "Hello World" );
    exit();
    
}
add_action( 'template_redirect', 'test_plugin_hello' );

Check out the 'redirect_post_location' filter.

You can see it in action at line 75 in /wp-admin/post.php

Hope that helps.

You need to go into the permalinks setting page, save the changes (even
without changing anything) and then your rewrite rules get invoked and
written.

Subject: [wp-hackers] apply_filters() in an if statement?
Message-ID: <CALri7Mn2qtqEXvn2nGwStSVhaKBovG2Dimf=ovHYYo23DPp-LQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Sorry in advance if this type of question belongs on the forums...

I am hacking a theme, and they have something like this (abbreviated):

[code]

if (option('foo') || apply_filters('baz_baz', '') ||
apply_filters('bar_bar', '')) {

   $bar_bar = apply_filters('bar_bar', blah, blah);
   $return = apply_filters('baz_baz', blah, blah);

}

[/code]

What does apply_filters('string', '') accomplish? I guess I am
confused because the second argument is an empty string.

This helps to explain (at least in my brain) what apply_filters() does:

"In the most basic terms, apply_filters is used to initialise a filter
hook... add_filter assigns a new function to hooks that have already
been created."
--<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2270989/what-does-apply-filters-actually-do-in-wordpress>

But why would you put it in an if statement with an empty string for
the second argument?

Am I talking crazy here?

Let me know if this type of question is too noob for this list. I
don't want to bug folks with simple ones. :D

Thanks a billion!

Cheers,
Micky

I think that it depends on the case (i.e. on the add filters afterwards),
but anyway - apply_filters returns the result of the empty strings after
all add_filter(...) calls are applied. More here -
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/apply_filters#Return

So there is a chance that this call is actually appropriate and correct.

It's an easy way for a plugin to change the outcome of an if() check.

For instance, if I wanted to display a banner above my header, I could do
this:

if ( apply_filters( 'show_banner_above_header', '' ) )
  show_banner_above_header();

or, I would more likely do this:

if ( apply_filters( 'show_banner_above_header', false ) )
  show_banner_above_header();

... then a plugin could come along and do this:

add_filter( 'show_banner_above_header', '__return_true' );

... and the banner would then show.

Of course, you could reverse the whole things and use __return_false as the
callback for add_filter() and get the opposite result.

WOW! Super fast replies! Thanks so much Mario and Nathan! Your replies
have been very helpful. :)

I'm experimenting now with the information and code you folks have
given me (I may be back with questions).

@Nathan: using false looks better to me (v.s. using an empty sting).

Also, '__return_true'/'__return_false' is new syntax to me... I
uderstand what it does, I just have never seen that particular syntax
before.

You folks ROCK!!! Many thanks! :)

Cheers,
M

Micky, they're callback functions in WordPress that do exactly what they
imply, so you don't have to use anonymous functions or create your own
callback function that just returns true.

Any yes, they are extremely handy :-)

Ahhh, coool! Now, that's handy! :)

(Sorry, I probably should have searched the docs on that one).

Awesome. This list === life saver.

Have a great day all!
