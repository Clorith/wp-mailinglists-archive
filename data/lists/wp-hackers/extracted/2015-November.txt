Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin updates, licensing + renewal plugin
Message-ID: <5642017B.5050607@wordshell.net>

Hi,

Some of you may recall that some moons ago, I released a free plugin for 
providing plugin updates services for free plugins, managed from your WP 
dashboard.

The plan was to then have a paid version that added features for paid 
plugins (specifically, licence management). I've now changed course, and 
released the would-have-been-premium version for free. This plugin is 
the full version of what's used at updraftplus.com since 2013 to deliver 
hundreds of thousands of updates to customers (though, updraftplus.com 
isn't yet update to the latest major version, and relies on bespoke 
coding for some features before they were added to the main plugin).

It allows distribution of free and paid plugins, and handling of 
licences (add, delete, renew, reset), and automatic sending of reminders 
to licensees with expiring licences. There's even a class so that you 
can integrate an updater into your plugin with 1 include and 1 line of 
configuration: 
https://github.com/DavidAnderson684/simba-plugin-manager-updater

The plugin is here:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/simba-plugin-updates-manager/

What's the catch? No catch... but there is a paid add-on for WooCommerce 
integration (automatic creation and renewal of licences, renewal 
discount coupons, linking orders with licenses, links in renewal 
reminder emails to automatically pre-fill the cart). If you're 
interested in an integration for another e-commerce plugin, then give me 
a shout off-list.

Regards,
David

Hello!  Haven't seen any activity here but I hope someone is still
listening here.  I have a problem that I need help solving, related to this
ticket: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34465#comment:3

Basically, the bug I found is if you create a media modal and set the
library to exclude any attachments, the media modal won't update when you
upload files.  Code to replicate the bug is in the last comment on the
ticket.  Thank you to anyone that replies

Resurrecting this old topic because I came across the following posts

Wow. This is a really old topic. The WTF of using resources over a decade
old. I wonder if Joel has the same opinion a decade later. Really it
doesn't matter what their opinions are.

Exceptions are essentially just taking the return status out of the manual
implementation and putting it into the language. So instead of returning
some status code that the programmer has to manually lookup and take some
action. You create an exception and throw that, which returns the exception
from the function. The advantage is that you can use additional language
features to provide a single place for cleanup.

Now technically, if you are talking about Java or C++, you are looking at
traps and lower level instructions when throwing exceptions, but I doubt
PHP works that way. Exceptions are just prettier status codes. Anyone who
tells you otherwise doesn't know what they are talking about or being
pedantic, but you can safely ignore this person as they lack the
imagination to understand what exceptions are actually doing.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress.Org plugins directory search suggestion
Message-ID: <56505139.7050909@wordshell.net>

Hi,

I didn't want to post this to the wordpress.org plugins email address, 
as I realise that's busy enough for the team there and didn't want to 
force them to read it. But, if anyone has time to here (and a public 
answer that's Googleable might not hurt)...

The wordpress.org plugins directory always returns any plugin whose slug 
you enter exactly as the #1 result. That's hard-wired. That seems 
reasonable - if someone searches directly for something, then that 
should come first.

However, that breaks down badly when slugs are very generic terms - 
especially single words.

e.g.:

* "Backup". The result is unmaintained for 3 years, tested up to WP 3.4, 
and is only for Google Drive, using a Google API that doesn't exist any 
more - so, useless.

* "Contact" - brings up a plugin last modified > a year ago, tested up 
to WP 4.0.

* "Pinterest" - brings up a plugin last updated  4 years ago, tested up 
to WP 3.3. (I realise that a new submission of this sort would fail the 
new trademark policy).

It seems to me that at a minimum, the "always return a plugin whose slug 
exactly matches" should not apply on single-word searches. Otherwise, 
even with the new trademark policy preventing some abuses, users are 
stuck with rubbish/obsolete search results on some common terms for all 
eternity.

David

Firstly, searching for single words is not the best way to search the
plugin directory. Single word searches are largely useless. We're searching
the readme.txt files. What did you expect to find with simplistic searching?

However, "backup" was modified 7 hours ago, "contact" in the last year, and
"pinterest" I've closed because you brought it up and it is indeed 4 years
old.

Bringing these up to the plugins email address is indeed the correct
approach. We weed too.

Hi Otto,

Thanks for replying. I wasn't personally suggesting searching using 
single-word terms. I was assuming that real-world users do that, and 
that giving them better results where possible would be a reasonable 
thing to do.

I don't have access to the search engine stats. Some stats on the 
average length of searches would be interesting. It may be a non-problem.
> However, "backup" was modified 7 hours ago,
Something interesting seems to have happened on this one. Here's the 
ancient "backup" plugin I was referring to via the Internet Archive, 
which was the 'live' one until I sent my email: 
https://web.archive.org/web/20150905125725/https://wordpress.org/plugins/backup/
It seems that someone then got in with a different one for 1 day: 
https://web.archive.org/web/20151122192417/https://wordpress.org/plugins/backup/ 
. It's now gone: https://wordpress.org/plugins/backup/ - returns no 
direct result for that slug.
>   "contact" in the last year, and
That's what I said: '"Contact" - brings up a plugin last modified > a 
year ago, tested up to WP 4.0.'. My point wasn't that they're all 
necessarily ancient; just that they're not good #1 results for the 
search term entered, when all the possible search factors that could be 
involved are taken into account (reviews + ratings, downloads, whether 
the plugin is maintained, + other indicators of how much the author 
cares (e.g. using a banner/icon)).

Thanks. I will do this in future. I was asking because based on a 
previous conversation (can't recall which one of the people on the 
mailbox it was with), I'd understood that ancient plugins aren't removed 
from the directory search because of the possibility that someone may 
find their code useful even if they can't run on recent WP versions. 
Since that's not the case, I'll just report them directly in future.

David

Yes, something interesting did. I'm still working on that particular one at
the moment. Special case.

Search is not a popularity contest. Always showing the same plugins all the
time is not good for the community. The results do vary quite a lot, but
really, if somebody is looking for a particular plugin, then we should show
it to them first. As much as possible.

We definitely remove plugins from the directory if installing them will
break your site. But not just because they're "old".
