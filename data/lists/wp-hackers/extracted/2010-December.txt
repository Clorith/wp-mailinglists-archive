Subject: [wp-hackers] wp-login.php redirecting to https
Message-ID: <AANLkTimsGPdKDFDbF3o-7YokXvOkA_dXHZ7cGtAt4WEf@mail.gmail.com>

I recently restored a WP multi-site 3.0.1 database from production to a
staging environment, and when I try to login, I am being redirected to an
HTTPS URL. The browser complains that the certificate is bad, and then when
I click "proceed", it says page not found. I have cleared my browser cookies
and all that good stuff, but it still won't let me login.

Also, I am experiencing intermittent "No site defined on this host" errors
when I try to login.

I've never seen this issue before, and I have definitely done this backup db
restore process before.

Thanks for your help,
Dave

Message-ID: <4CF66492.50906@duechiacchiere.it>

Hi everybody,

I'm testing 3.1 beta on my blog. This morning I was publishing some 
articles using Windows Live Writer. When I accessed the Edit Posts 
panel, I saw a label [Default] next to the title of those articles. 
Label that doesn't appear when articles are published through Wordpress 
itself. I must say I'm using a different user to connect to my WP via 
WLW. Anybody willing to shed some light on this mystery?

Thank you,
Dino.

"Default" is a reference to the new post formats feature of 3.1.  All it
means is that those specific posts use the "default" post format, not *video
*, *audio*, *aside*, etc ...

To add some further clarification, when publishing posts via XML-RPC, the
"default" post format is used automatically.

If post formats aren't enabled on your site (you can enable them using a
single call in your functions.php file), the post format is not set but is *
assumed* to be default.  Live Writer does not yet have the ability to set
different post formats, but once it does you'll be able to use the full list
of supported formats (default, audio, video, aside, chat, gallery, image,
link, quote, status) throughout your site.  Your theme may style posts
differently based on the format, but "default" posts will be styled
normally.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Page Templates vs Category Templates
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=432+rN+M3EibG5MmF=kKkAmOH8_ie8TEQQ6bw@mail.gmail.com>

When you create a Page, you may choose a Page template, right out of
the box installation of a WordPress. All you need is a few Page
Templates to exist in the theme folder.

Example:

	SideBar SideBar Content
	
	Content SideBar
	
	Content SideBar SideBar
	
	etc...
	
But when you create a category on the admin page, you do not have that
functionality. That always confused me. Why the lack of that
functionality from the cat's side?

It is very natural to think that you may have one category to have a
different look and feel than another one, video stuff for example...
Of course, one can have the functionality of using a different cat.
template using the  category-Whatever.php trick. But then, when you
think about it, "that very way" is also very possible for the pages,
thanks to the  as Page_Whatever.php trick. But yet, Pages Admin area
do have the capabilities to select a page template thru a drop down
conveniently while Category Admin area do not.

I'm curious to find the design  criteria behind that difference...

I don't think it was so much a decision, as organic growth: more people
needed and asked for dedicated page templates.

Besides, there currently is no good place to store this information, since
we don't have term meta.

If it's trivial to have "a few Page Templates to exist in the theme folder",
why is not equally trivial to have "category-id.php" and/or
"category-slug.php" templates also in the theme folder?

You don't "have that functionality" for Pages, either, unless the specified
Page templates have already been created. The template-file functionality is
exactly the same for Categories; the difference is only in the UI. With
Pages, a template is selected; with Posts, a Category is selected. In both
cases, the desired template file must already exist in order to be used.

That's not a "trick"; that's the proper way to define different styles
and/or layouts for different Categories. Why would you call it a "trick"?
It's no more (or less) of a "trick" than creating different Page templates.

How is it less convenient to select a Post Category than it is to select a
Page template? One is a drop-down; the other is a check-box. Both require
one, simple user action.

Pages are stand-alone. Blog Posts are part of a timeline. Pages are (or can
be) hierarchical; Posts are sequential.

Thus, it makes sense for Posts to have an "index", based on time (date
archives) or taxonomy (Category and Tag archives), and for that "index" to
define the style/layout for the Posts that fall into it. Pages, on the other
hand, stand alone entirely, and even their hierarchical relationship only
impacts site navigation. Thus, it makes perfect sense that Pages should be
able to specify their style/layout templates individually.

I see your points. But I still do not get why have "that convenient
functionality" in one ( that is Add New Page UI ) but not in the other
( that is Add New Category UI).

You are saying "The template-file functionality is exactly the same
for Categories; the difference is only in the UI." I'm asking Why the
UIs are different...

You may ask who cares...  new comers may. me for sure. I'm sure most
users go thru this kind of cycle.

step 1:  install WP
step 2: create a post ( which goes automatically into "uncategorized ")
step 3: create a category
step 4: create a few more and then get a sense of how this thing really kicks...
and then soon after discover the wonderful world of themes...  which
show cases various page layouts..  ( but no category layouts! )

soon you bring a few themes home, & you see, the page layouts, ( the
SideBar on the left, sidebar on the right stuff ) and you get to
choose them when you are creating pages, but the cats got no luck! As
a new comer, you definitely go thru this.

Then you look back into your categories and wonder why on earth this
functionality why the lack of those various page layouts options DO
NOT EXIST for categories even though it is EQUALLY & EASILY achievable
by WP. And interestingly, cats are the 1st group where you need this
kind of flexibility, I think more than the pages...  Why should not I
have a no sidebar ( just content layout ) for some of my category
pages...  but you look at the themes world, majority provide a
no-sidebar layout only for the pages but cats are totally left alone.
I think this end-result may be trickling down from the out-of-the-box
WP UI which exposes Page layoutsbut not the cat layouts.

I'm sure Jane must have thought about this and decided the way it is
now. I'm only curious to understand the wisdom behind it.

I amy be wrong, but it just appears to me that if the next version
were to expose this functionality, it would not only make it
convenient to the end user to select a category template from the drop
down but also encourage the theme designers to bundle their themes
with as many category layouts as the page layouts they provide.

The analogous page to "Add Page" is not "Add Category", but rather "Add
Post".

I tried to give one explanation, dealing with the differences between Posts
and Pages. They behave differently because *they are different*.

It strikes me that perhaps the question you are really asking is: why do
Theme developers bundle various Page templates, but don't likewise bundle
various Category templates? There are many reasons, but the most prominent
one is probably that a publicly released Theme isn't likely to know in
advance what categories will be used by any given user.

One thing that *might* help will be Post Formats in 3.1. A Theme can use
known Post Format types ("gallery", "aside", etc.), and then add Category
templates using those same Post-Format type names - then instruct the Theme
user to categorize the Post identically to the Post-Format type (e.g., to
remove sidebars from "image" or "gallery" Posts).

But how would you propose that? It would be totally unintuitive, unless you
tied the Post-index layout template to the *Taxonomy*, rather than to
individual *Posts*. (For example: to "expose" the UI on the Add Post page
would require the user both to define the Category *and* to define the
template. Further, a defined Post template would apply to the single Post
view, but not the index (archive) view.)

I just don't think it's as straight-forward as you're imagining, due to the
inherent differences between Pages and Posts.

Because the functionality evolved, it wasn't built to a master plan (like almost all open-source software.)

We (the WordPress community) haven't gotten there yet. Maybe we will, all depends on what the core team thinks is important and if someone builds it to contribute.

Because the implementations are different and grew out of different paths.  And in part because the requirements are different.  A category archive page displays a list of posts, a Page Template typically only displays one post.  That's not a defense of it, just an explanation as to why it might be the way it is.

Frankly I'm not a new comer but I could see value in it too.  But my seeing value is not the same as me recognizing why it is not there (yet?) and the process required for something to get included. Believe me, I've gone down the path of advocating for a feature only to have it shot down so I know about the process first hand.

One of the other reasons is URL routing. Currently the URL routing system views a category URL to be very different from a page URL.  Pages that users add as content are managed by users, and pages that come for free as part of the architecture are managed by WordPress core.

Again, it is what it is.

If you need this functionality today if can be done but would have you implement a Page Template that lists your categories and then you create a Page for this and renamed your category slug something obscure.  You may also need to write a bit of PHP to hide tell WordPress your category URL is the URL of the page.

Again, it's just not part of WordPress today.  But it is doable.

I'm pretty sure this was baked into WordPress long before Jane joined.  Or at least before she had dealt with bigger issues.

It's all about priorities and frankly developer interest.  

Expect a post from Jane after v3.1 releases asking what they community wants next.  If it seems that many in the community it and some developers are excited about it, maybe something like this will make it into core.

Hope this helps.

Well, semantically speaking I do not see a difference...
Obviously page layouts do not go thru that mental challenge. After
all, all they provide layout options
such as

SB SB C
SB C
C SB
large SB, medium SB, C
C, small SB, small SB

They obviously do not care or worry about what the end-user be doing
with those columns. So I can't really connect to your explanation of
"Theme isn't likely to know in advance what categories will be used by
any given user."

Unless I'm just completely misunderstanding what you're saying, why would
you need to do all of that?

If you know that you will want your category "Foobar"  to display full-width
with no sidebars, you merely need to add a "category-foobar.php" template
file, in which you remove the sidebars (and add appropriate CSS definitions
via the body.category-foobar class), and your "Foobar" category posts will
now display as desired.

But when you have the category-foobar.php, you've got to name the
category slug as foobar - which is not URL friendly. And that's where
the buck stops. When we stretch the concept a little, we  soon see
that approach may lead to dead-ends such as
"Category-sidebar-sidebar-content.php" and obviously that's the end of
the idea

Interestingly, pages do not suffer from this problem. Why? Is it
because they got the special functionality that is you could create
any php file and tuck the "Template Name:  Something Like Sidebar
Sidebar Content" at its header? And simple there is no room for
category's to be able to benefit from something like that?

Could the post-formats take care of this? I doubt cause the post
formats are addressing the problem at the post level, not at the
category level.

I still believe that it is a good feature to enable users so that when
they are creating a new category for a new bunch of post types, they
will be able to pick from a dropdown a layout of choice. But I just
don't see how it can be done with the way Template Hiearchy is, the
way WP is.

Yes, the current structure allows me to come up with
category-videos.php, category-audios.php, category-articles.php but
layout wise, the first two may be using the very same look and feel (
that is one-column no sidebar layout ) , while the 3rd ( the articles
) is using the content + sidebar layout. Even though, I need 2
layouts, I still need 3 category.php's. You may say, why not have the
default category.php to have one column layout then you can stil get
away with 2 category templates. But when you have 100 cats, and 10
different layout options, that idea will not work.

We should be able to group categories as far as layouts as well. For
exammple, categories a,b,c,d,e,f will use 1 column lay out and cats
t,u,x,y,z will use 4 column layout. Is that somehow possible? If so
how?

We are deeply immersed in using WordPress so the way it works is "obvious", at least to us.  We've been use to it for so long we don't expect anything different, and we know how it is implemented so its again "obvious" for it to work certain ways.

But I've been working for several months with a client who is having me build software on top of WordPress for their clients and one of the things they constantly say to me "But the way WordPress does it just doesn't make intuitive sense (so we need you to change it to work differently.)"  If you saw the admin console of the site I've been working on, you wouldn't  recognize it save for the most fundamental aspects.

So, hopefully without getting anyone's defensives up and without me making any value judgements at all on the current state of WordPress there is an argument to be made that some aspects of WordPress are not intuitive to people who are unfamiliar with using WordPress.

Yes that works fine for the user with skills to create templates and is what I would do.  But it's a bit much for a non-technical user.

Now I'll admit up front I might has misunderstood what Haluk was after because reading his email I immediately thought "Yes, I can see that" but it might have been me overlying my ideas instead of recognizing his concerns.  

But ignoring if I misunderstood Haluk I could see an argument where every web page in WordPress outside the admin could be managed using the "Pages" module instead of having their URLs hardwired into WordPress, with the exception of 
things that are more specifics such as Posts or a Custom post types like "Product" of course.

Imagine that instead of just having the URL root slugs /category/ and /tag/ and /2010/ baked into WordPress instead they were predefined "Pages" where the user could control the URL slug and add content such as intro text above the list of posts. I think that would more intuitive for the user who is not intimate with WordPress than what we currently have.

Am I pushing for this?  No, it's not my hot button.  But I think it might be a nice addition and I wanted to recognize Haluk's suggestion with positive reinforcement. It's really not that far away from what we already have, just a bit of changed UI, that's all.

Something like (I've not tested this code, it's just the concept):

<?php // category.php
global $wp_query;
$term = $wp_query->get_queried_object();
if (in_array($term->slug,array('a','b','c','d','e','f')))
   include "category-1column.php";
else if (in_array($term->slug,array('t','u','x','y','z')))
   include "category-4column.php";

I can actually think of at least 5 ways to map the categories to a template file, it is just one of those ways.

Hope this helps.

As most of you know, WordPress 3.0.2 was released Tuesday. This is a
mandatory security release for all previous WordPress versions.

Those wishing to continue to test the 3.1 Beta, please note that the
currently nightly build (3.1-beta1-16642) contains the fixes that were
included in 3.0.2.

I'd advise you to update your plugin compatibility as appropriate. Plugins
should be unaffected by this release.

Here's a summary of the changes:

How about:

"some UI in the theme to associate your categories with provided templates"

the theme stores $cat_mappings[category-foo.php'] =>
'no-sidebar-template.php';
and $cat_mappings[category-bar.php'] => 'no-sidebar-template.php';
and $cat_mappings[category-bop.php'] => 'left-sidebar-template.php';

Then hook on 'category_template' filter:

add_filter('category_template', 'map_category_templates');
function 'map_category_templates'($template) {
    if (isset($cat_mappings[$template]) )
        return $cat_mappings[$template];
    return $template;
}

Mike, quick question..

You want to basically have each category have their own look right?

You know you can do this with CSS and a body_class() filter right?

Yes, of course.

The topic is essentially about being able to select *theme provided* layouts
on a per category basis (similar to how you do for page templates -- and
they could be the same ones) for people who are not up to creating/modifying
themes.

Ah yeah I do that in comicpress with a drop down selection of which layout 
the user wants to use.

In the header at the very bottom I put a get_template_part('layout','head'); 
and first line of the footer get_template_part('layout','foot'); which 
handles the layout code, and based on the user selection I wrote an if 
(comicpress_is_layout('standard,vertical')) {  then handle it.  each of the 
pages only contains the 'content' of those specific pages, while the layout 
pages handle the sidebars etc how the content is displayed, etc.

Think I have 11 different layouts, most with their own widths and some 
without certain sidebars etc.

Catching up on reading the whole thread right now.

Yeah reading the thread, it's not as difficult as you guys are making it, 
doing the template_part and doing "if (in_category('categoryname')) in the 
layout parts would work just as well"

In the theme's setting pages you can probably also define which categories 
get which layouts too, which would be quite a bit easier then hardcoding.

you'll find it attached.

It aims to be flexible enough but as you'll notice,
there is much code for verbosity and dry-run.

still a bit PoF but working quite well so far.

comments welcomed.
(if there are better, free, alternatives easily scriptable/crontab-able, 
I'm also interested in)

Wow, it would be nice for us plugin developers if you guys would give us
even a few days advance notice on these things, especially considering your
record of breaking plugins and themes with your updates.

The problem is that when people see the "Please update now" notice on their
dashboard, and you call it a mandatory update, of course they are going to
update. But with no advance notice, that means that no plugins or themes
have even been tested with the update. As far as I can tell, there was also
no public beta testing for this either, are you just hoping everything will
work? Even your e-mail announcement to the wp-testers list came a day after
the actual release.

With tens of thousands of plugins and themes used by millions of people, you
really need to better consider the impact of your releases. It's hard enough
keeping compatible with each update, but you make it so much harder when we
suddenly open our e-mail to find a flood of support requests because of a
surprise WordPress release. We had to drop everything yesterday to update
all our test sites, scramble though our full test procedures, and respond to
all the support requests telling people our plugins are still compatible.

Perhaps you need to put a disclaimer on releases that no plugin or theme
developers were previously aware of it and nothing has been tested yet so
install at your own risk.

If there is a better way to keep on top of upcoming releases that I am just
missing, please let me know. And yeah maybe this release was relatively
minor but there is rarely a WordPress release that doesn't affect many
plugins one way or another.

Are there any other plugin and theme developers out there who agree?

As most of you know, WordPress 3.0.2 was released Tuesday. This is a
mandatory security release for all previous WordPress versions.

Those wishing to continue to test the 3.1 Beta, please note that the
currently nightly build (3.1-beta1-16642) contains the fixes that were
included in 3.0.2.

I'd advise you to update your plugin compatibility as appropriate. Plugins
should be unaffected by this release.

Here's a summary of the changes:

Thanks,

This was a security update, so it had to be released as soon as possible.

Also, point releases such as 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 do not bring major changes, so
all themes and plugins should work just fine.

I appreciate your sentiment, but I wholeheartedly disagree.

WordPress 3.0.2 was not a feature update.  It didn't add new hooks or
filters.  It didn't change the (expected/documented) behavior of core
functionality.  This new release fixed specific bugs and security
vulnerabilities that existed in WordPress 3.0.1.

To have a public beta period for a security fix announces to the world that
there is a problem and potential exploit for blogs living in the wild and
points out specifically that they have no way to defend themselves.  It
opens every site up to a publicly-known, documented security risk.

Maintenance patches should *always be pushed as quickly as possible to the
market.  They fix live bugs and help site administrators better protect the
content and frameworks for which they're responsible.*

**WordPress 3.1 (the actual feature release) is still in beta and is giving
plug-in and theme developers ample time to bring their systems up-to-spec
with the latest version.  But any system built to the documented specs of
WordPress 3.0.1 should work with 3.0.2 unless you were specifically using
the broken functions in the way we were trying to fix.

i am not a wp expert at all. and don't know the inner workings, but i
already see its power, and the flexibility it could offer.

i want to suggest one way to achieve what i was asking about. since
i'll be making this assumption with probably less than 5% of your
average know-how on wp, my chances are getting it right is pretty
slim, but hey, let's give it a shot.

pages got one loop and the loop pulls one record.

cats on the other hand has one loop too but that one matches one or
more records. so far, no conflict.

and the url tells WP as to what type to work with, is it a page or is
it a cat? - so far, no conflict.

both has their own page.php and category.php handlers - so far, no conflict.

and both of these handlers also understand from their own x-ID.php,
x-SLUG.php conveniences.  so far, no conflict. but not a 100%
paralellism there. let me explain.

for some reason, when it comes to the page display, pages can go a
step higher ( that the cats ) and use any page templates if some
association has been made thru the page templates drop down at page
creation time. ( thanks to the <? template: whatever ?> one liner in
some page templates )

because of this cat-17.php at its highest hierarchy level when it
comes to category templates but page-13.php is not. pageWhatever.php
can overwrite that!


now.. what has lead to this end could be interesting study to find out
for the historically inclined among us but as for what can be done
from now on is what i am more interested in.


first of all, is it safe to say this...

no matter how you put it or how you defense it, common user would
naturally be baffled when they realize that the categories do not have
the same layout flexibility as the the pages do, though cats are the
breads and butter of the WP. Actually, they would have been less
surprised if actually pages were to one that lacked the feature.


i think sooner or later, categories are needed to be fixed to work
exactly the same way pages do. when that's done, we will also see
theme designers rushing into providing those extra category layouts
the same way they take to time to shop and brag about with the page
layout templates.

now, in order to make it function exactly the same way... can the
following be worked out?

at the top of *****category pages****, I suggest to add these two liners

<?
Template: My category layout page
TemplateType: category
?>

with these two liners, page UI's drop down would tend to pull those
category templates into the  page templates drop down but I don't
think it is a major task to filter out those that also have the
templateType: category line in there.

So, with one minor modification, page UI may continue to work the same
way as it does now and the page layout drop down.

and by doing some work ( and u guys must step into plate cause i've
got 0 php background ), add category UI, will also get a similar drop
down . exactyl like the one page UI feaures ) and this one will pull
those those templates which have both Template and TemplateType
information where the TemplateType is 'category'.

so, that could take care of the UI.

of course this info got to be kept somewhere for the cats.. but it
shouldn't be that hard cause that kind of thing is already being done
for the pages. since i do not know how WP does these things, I'm
clueless as to what tables to go to, what hooks to work with. it
conceptually appears to me as doable. that's all.

in this case, pages will continue to work with the hierarchy as follows;


any page template  takes the top slot and then
page-x.php, then page-slug.php, then page.php

but that's no news. we already know that!

but categories will match that as follows;

any category template  (  one of those that's got both Template :
whatever and TemplateType: category and is also associated with one
category )
category-x.php
category-slug.php
category.php

now, as to the url interpretation,

wp  already figures out from the url if it is a page type, and if so
to go look for the associated page template's for the page and work
with it.

so why can't it figure out if it is a cat type, then look for the
associated category template for that category, and work with it?

with this trick, if I have 300 cats, and say the first 100 happen to
use 1 column layout, the second 100 happen to use 2 colomn layout, and
say the last 100 use 3 colomn layout, I do not have to get into php
tricks to pull this off and i just select one of the avaiable category
templates from the category template. done.

and for that to take place, all the user needs to do is to pick a
theme that comes with those additional category templates, and @
adding-a-category-time, choose 1 or 2 or 3 colomn layout.

with this approach, existing themes and templates and page UI will
continue to work the same way with absolutely no change in any part of
the codex ( except page template drop down needs to filter out those
templates with the template type:category extra line in them).

is this a long shot?

Page template associations are stored as hidden custom fields.

Categories don't have custom fields. So, for this to happen, you would also
have to convince the lead devs that an additional wp_termmeta table is worth
it.

To clarify, nothing about your proposal is outlandishly difficult to
achieve, given the current code base. It can relatively easily be done
through a plugin, as a matter of fact.

So, it's not so much a technical problem but a political problem, if you
will: is this something that needs to be in the WordPress core?

Isn't that what a custom taxonomy is?

I think there's some underlying preconceptions in this thread that
need to be addressed. For example, Haluk said "cats are the breads and
butter of the WP", which I would disagree with. Most people don't use
categories very well, often, or at all. Until we get post-formats,
cats are most often used to specify layout instead of to group posts
together and to provide a location for them in the URL structure. Most
sites I see (including my own) have very bad category structures.

Categories, frankly, just aren't that important in the grand scheme.
They're one (pre-defined) taxonomy out of many possible taxonomies.
The idea needs to be generalized.

More to the point though, categories, like tags, are not "things".
They are not nouns, they are adjectives. They don't have meta-data
because they *are* meta-data. So while yes, there's nothing
technically difficult about giving them their own template choice
boxes, it doesn't seem to be an effective use of the system. You'd
have to attach meta to meta, which doesn't make any sense. Adjectives
don't usually have their own adjectives.

In a sense, Pages and Page Templates can already sorta do what you're
suggesting. You could make a Page Template that displayed the page
content first, followed by some selection of Posts. That selection of
posts (what terms defined it) could be defined by some set of
meta-data attached to the Page itself, somehow. This basically fills
your requirements. It has its own URL, you can select the template for
it, you can define text...

There's a more generic idea here that I can't put my finger on yet.

To continue the grammar analogy, adjectives don't have their own adjectives,
but they can have adverbs attached to them, as weird as that may sound.

Anyway, even as they stand, categories do have some meta data of their own:
the user-friendly title is the most obvious one.

The generic idea I have is to allow posts to be attached directly to pages,
which goes back to allowing many-to-many relationships between posts
(objects).

After updating all the files, and logging in to the main blog, can someone
tell me if it is a requirement to click on "Update" under the Super Admin
tab on a multi-site instance, or is that not necessary?

Thanks!

I'd prefer that to happen with shared terms between them, although I
haven't figured a good UI for it yet.

Imagine you could put a page in a category. The page template could
then pull all the posts that share the same category.

Is there a nice wrapper function like the administration menus, or
should plugins just use the add_menu() method of the global

In the Grand scheme of things. This would be a good use case for termmeta.

I run a website for a radio station and using a custom tax would be good for me and need more meta, rather than storing an array in the description.

From there once there is a place to store it this whole conversation becomes plug-in territory. I think we would be amazed where plugins will lead WP with term meta.

A although the original poster only has needs for categories. This has a huge benefit for all taxes. It would even open up having a varied number posts on a per term bases is we just had a place to store it.

now on my notebook.
I think this works, an example:

function wp_codex_search_form() {
global $wp_admin_bar, $wpdb;

if ( !is_super_admin() || !is_admin_bar_showing() )
return;
 $codex_search = '<form target="_blank" method="get" action="
http://wordpress.org/search/do-search.php" style="margin:2px 0 0;">
 <input type="text" onblur="this.value=(this.value==\'\') ? \'Search the
Codex\' : this.value;" onfocus="this.value=(this.value==\'Search the
Codex\') ? \'\' : this.value;" maxlength="100" value="Search the Codex"
name="search" class="adminbar-input">
 <button type="submit" class="adminbar-button">
<span>Go</span>
 </button>
</form>';
 /* Add the main siteadmin menu item */
$wp_admin_bar->add_menu( array( 'id' => 'codex_search', 'title' => 'Search
Codex', 'href' => FALSE ) );
 $wp_admin_bar->add_menu( array( 'parent' => 'codex_search', 'title' =>
$codex_search, 'href' => FALSE ) );
}
add_action( 'admin_bar_menu', 'wp_codex_search_form', 1000 );

See my point above. You already can have more than one post associated to
the same term. That's what a primary purpose of a term is: to group posts.

with all due respect, Otto, if the web site talks about say breaking
news from countries all over the world, and it is all about that,
wouldn't you start with the continents at the top as your main nav and
be that driven by wp_list_categories?  And with one click, you are
down to the country names ( which are again the product of cats) .

I think you agree that it would make the best sense that we use the
cats as the main kicker for this type of site and there could be
hundreds of thousands of site where "noun" based categorizer be it all
the way at the top or at sub levels are just all over the place.
whether it is a bad or good practice, it is too late fix/teach/fight
against etc.

but yet, ( going back to the original idea of this thread ), we still
have no intuitive way and UI to sort out the layout need without
getting into the php code.

I understand that it is not a matter of if it could be done, and
rather it's an if it should be done.
but i thought this was a just slam dunk.

Categories *might* be the best taxonomy to use, or they *might not* be the
best taxonomy. For example, the *type* of news (Politics, Sports, Personal
Interest, etc.) might best use the Category taxonomy - in which case,
Geography might need a custom taxonomy of its own. It's all a matter of how
the site owner chooses to organize his content.

I think you don't know Otto very well. :)  But more importantly, I'm quite
certain that he would *not agree*. The choice of taxonomy is a personal
matter that depends entirely upon the organizational scheme determined by
the content owner. There's no right or wrong answer.

Most ideas - even bona fide "slam dunk" ideas - start out as "Plugin
territory" - both to provide proof-of-concept, and also to test-drive the
functionality, to demonstrate that it works and is useful and popular.  From
my perspective, WordPress core development tends more toward providing
frameworks for extensible functionality (see: custom taxonomies, custom
post_types, action/filter hooks, and the Plugin API).

If you'd really like to get a handle for support for the idea, though, I
would recommend opening up a Trac ticket, describing the functionality you
would like to have.

Yeah just call add_menu from a suitable hook

I'd use a custom taxonomy for that, but I do get your meaning. Any
time you can come up with a bunch of "categories" which are all of the
same type of item (places, people, etc), then you've got a good case
for a custom taxonomy to group those descriptive terms together.

My noun/adjective analogy is not a perfect one. What I mean by it is
that the posts are the "things" here, and the terms are what give some
kind of flavor to those things. Yes, "America" is a "noun", but if you
use it to describe something about a post, then it's really an
"adjective" in the sense that it's descriptive of that post's
content/type/category/flavor. Especially when you also have "China"
and "India" as other possible terms to add onto posts as well.

With a custom taxo, you can then call it, say, "place", and have
things like http://example.com/place/china to give all the posts about
goings-on in China. And so on. With multiple taxonomies, you could
even do something like
http://example.com/?place=china&person=ma-ying-jeou to describe stuff
happening in China that has to do with Ma Ying-jeou. It's feasible to
even pretty that URL up a bit, in whatever way you want to do that.

Custom Taxo's can have pretty UI's too. For the place taxo, you could
have it automatically create a new Meta box that lets you pick the
checkboxes, like the category picker does. And for the people taxo,
you could get a UI just like the Tag picker does, where you can type
in individual's names.

There is indeed room to work on the matter of theming and templating
for custom taxo's, I grant you.

Think of it this way too. A term links topics together but they have properties too.

In my instance I have a radio station. I use a custom taxonomy "shows" for my show listing.

Shows has a Title, a Slug, a short blurb (description) and all it's posts.

But it is also has a thumbnail, Times it airs, etc.

Now a custom post type, but to have the ability to post posts for each show I need a taxonomy.

Using additional terms allows more control in this case. I'm not even suggesting that we need to create a new table but more of a custom fields array field in the wp_terms table.

Thus allowing additional descriptions etc

Erm, no. Squeezing everything into a serialized column doesn't scale.

If it would, you could already use the description field like that.

Of those 11 changes, 9 of them were merged to the branch previously and were
in trunk for some time.

While only one was enough to trigger 3.0.3, seven changes were security
fixes or enhancements in some way.

It fixed four other really annoying and moderately severe bugs that were
already backported to the branch.

It was a security update. But since we maintain the 3.0 branch for
regressions, major bugs, and security enhancements (which we will until 3.2
beta), then a few other things got shipped with it. We were very pleased
with the quality of every change in the release, which were all thoroughly
re-inspected and re-tested. We carefully evaluated every other ticket under
3.0.x consideration for potential inclusion as well.

List of changes:

Correct. We decided to release.

As Pete Mall said, it took four hours from the initial report to final

But by no means count on that. Follow the WordPress Blog, Trac, your

Hi there,

First of all, sorry if this is the wrong channel to ask.

I've this plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/crpostwarning/
just released yesterday (around 16-17:00 GMT+7).
However, up until now, the download URL still 404. Is there any

I believe it's the same process with my other plugins.

Any help is appreciated.

Not really. A taxonomy doesn't have all the features of a page, no meta, etc. And it also have a more rigid URL structure than pages where the user can assign the URL. 

But please these are nuances and I'm not trying to start a debate; if it's important for you to view it differently than me this is not something I need to be right about. :)

To which I agree.

Yes, but there are adverbs that modify adjectives and for that meta-data can be useful.

When you start analyzing you find that categories and taxonomies really are often nouns.  For example Justin Tadlock created taxonomies for actors, directors, genres, producers, studios, and writers:

http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/06/04/using-custom-taxonomies-to-create-a-movie-database 

Of course you could argue those really should have been post types. But then you'd need post relationships for those...

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14513

...but I don't want to open that can of worms again.

What I will say is that I spent lots of time categorizing developer tools for a printed mail order catalog in the late 90s and I learned that whatever way you categorize anything is "wrong" because there's always another way to categorize it.  The reality is that everything that looks an adjective when you are categorizing really is a noun with attributes of it's own.  It's not always important to capture these attributes into your site, but sometimes it is.  If you have a taxonomy called "color" is sounds like an adjective until you find you need to know it's Pantone number, it's RGB components, etc.

What's further really useful is meta-data about a taxonomy-term, i.e. if I have a site about SaaS Solutions and I have a category of "Has API" it would be extremely useful to have metadata about that; a brief description of the API offering, a URL with the documentation, an indicator is access requires OAuth, etc.

Which brings me to what I suggested a while back which is that deprecate wp_taxonomy_terms in favor of a post_type='taxonomy_term' but that suggestion was never warmly received.

Which is essentially what I was suggesting would be an option, fyi.

I'm currently working on a system that uses shared terms, and I've found that it's basically a nightmare which is what I think prettyboymp said a while back. Shared terms introduce a level of complexity just not pragmatic enough for anything with otherwise moderate complexity. 

 But rather than include post relationships in core which I had pushed for I'm moving ahead with a plugin because it's at lot less political pain that way.

Great example.  But I'd argue that a "Show" should really be a custom post type (which you mention.)  Which brings the need for post relationships back up.  Of I've been told post relationships are an edge-case for WordPress so they are not something that will be added into core.

> Now a custom post type, but to have the ability to post posts for each show I need a taxonomy.

Again, an argument for post_type='taxonomy_term' instead of wp_taxonomy_term?

Agreed. Adjectives have definitions, too.

Yes.

When the localisation team for your language has produced an updated package you will be offered the ability to upgrade to that.

Meanwhile you will use the previous lang files

Periodic calls to

wp_cache_flush()

Ensure SAVEQUERIES isn't defined or empty $wpdb->queries often

Are good places to start

Also, consider PHP version. Running 5.3.3 (5.3.4 is in RC2 today) has a significantly better garbage collector than in the PHP 5.2 series.

summary:

original question

i asked

	what's wrong with the following idea?
 WP CORE UI from now on allows that when you are adding a category,
you are given the same choice options ( as in the add page UI ) that
you are able to select from a number of layout options ( such as 1,2
or N col. based page layouts?
	With pages, you can pull from the Page Templates drop down a layuot
template of your choice, ( if and only if the theme designer (or
yourself) provided a proper set of page templates )
	what i was trying to point out was not having this as an option when
adding a new category is mind-boggler. as a new comer to this
interface, my and my colleques found it really puzzling.
	
mike l interpreted this very question to summarize to others

	The topic is essentially about being able to select *theme provided* layouts
	on a per category basis (similar to how you do for page templates -- and
	they could be the same ones) for people who are not up to creating/modifying
	themes.

scribu ( for the same purpose as mike l ) re-worded the question as

	perhaps the question you are really asking is: why do
	Theme developers bundle various Page templates, but don't likewise bundle
	various Category templates?
		
from these, the general reaction to the idea was received by some as

	"why do you need that? cats are different than pages. there is NO
need to do that."
	
	and by some as
	
	....
	
	some approached it from a conceptual point of view, and said

			<otto>	
			Categories, frankly, just aren't that important in the grand scheme.
			They're one (pre-defined) taxonomy out of many possible taxonomies.
			The idea needs to be generalized.
			
			More to the point though, categories, like tags, are not "things".
			They are not nouns, they are adjectives. They don't have meta-data
			because they *are* meta-data. So while yes, there's nothing
			technically difficult about giving them their own template choice
			boxes, it doesn't seem to be an effective use of the system. You'd
			have to attach meta to meta, which doesn't make any sense. Adjectives
			don't usually have their own adjectives.
			
			In a sense, Pages and Page Templates can already sorta do what you're
			suggesting. You could make a Page Template that displayed the page
			content first, followed by some selection of Posts. That selection of
			posts (what terms defined it) could be defined by some set of
			meta-data attached to the Page itself, somehow. This basically fills
			your requirements. It has its own URL, you can select the template for
			it, you can define text...
			
			There's a more generic idea here that I can't put my finger on yet.
			</otto>	
		
	i appreciated this reply cause it opened it up for me but i disagreed
with it in parts. the not agreeing part for me was his remarks that
"it does not seem to be an effective use of the system..."
	
	cause when i read it, i started thinking...
	
	if i got 100 categories ( or custom taxonomies ) that require 1 col
layout, and another 100 that require 2 col-layout, and then another
require 3 col-layout, why should i ( as a beginner who wants to use
the WP as a CMS ) do this easily from the Core UI with just 3 category
layout templates? after all, similar functionality is available right
from the core UI for pages? why does it have to be taken care of this
thru a plug in when it comes to cats? my reaction to otto's ideas was,
how come this usage does not seem to be an effective use of the
system?
	
	
			
then we got mike s who re-came in to the picture and posted this which
i thought very valuable.

	mike's solution to the problem was a quick php hack... he was
inspired from this need of mine?

	We should be able to group categories as far as layouts as well. For
	exammple, categories a,b,c,d,e,f will use 1 column lay out and cats
	t,u,x,y,z will use 4 column layout. Is that somehow possible? If so
	how?
	
	mike's php snippet was
	
		<?php // category.php
		global $wp_query;
		$term = $wp_query->get_queried_object();
		if (in_array($term->slug,array('a','b','c','d','e','f')))
		  include "category-1column.php";
		else if (in_array($term->slug,array('t','u','x','y','z')))
		  include "category-4column.php";
	
	which was disclaimed with
	
		"I've not tested this code, it's just the concept):"
		
	and philip m came up with this later;
	
		In the header at the very bottom I put a
get_template_part('layout','head'); and first line of the footer
get_template_part('layout','foot'); which handles the layout code, and
based on the user selection I wrote an if
(comicpress_is_layout('standard,vertical')) {  then handle it.  each
of the pages only contains the 'content' of those specific pages,
while the layout pages handle the sidebars etc how the content is
displayed, etc.
		Think I have 11 different layouts, most with their own widths and
some without certain sidebars etc.
		
	and mike l suggested...
	
		How about:
	
		"some UI in the theme to associate your categories with provided templates"
		
		the theme stores $cat_mappings[category-foo.php'] =>
		'no-sidebar-template.php';
		and $cat_mappings[category-bar.php'] => 'no-sidebar-template.php';
		and $cat_mappings[category-bop.php'] => 'left-sidebar-template.php';
		
		Then hook on 'category_template' filter:
		
		add_filter('category_template', 'map_category_templates');
		function 'map_category_templates'($template) {
		   if (isset($cat_mappings[$template]) )
			   return $cat_mappings[$template];
		   return $template;
		}	
	
		may need to hook locate_templates too...
		
		Damn! no filters there...
		
		No time to look into it, but theres something in there that can be done.		
		
	
of course, i was only interested in solutions from the wordpress ui
point of view, so i suggested my own solution which I see now as way
off after reading otto's initial respond in which he excellently see
the need beyond cats but more generic. after all cats are only a
specific taxonomy among many thousands way of classifying content. up
until then, i was really looking at cats as the main bread and butter.
( to a new comer, that how wp really appears, so that's not my fault!
:)) But after the educational insight, i now know and say "i can't
believe it's not butter".

Yes, the problem do call for a more generic solution.

so any time, i create or add new category or custom taxonomy, i should
be able to select a layout from a drop down exactly like the page UI
makes it happen today.

if i am creating a custom tax or a cat, i obviously plan to have a
loop that hits every single post that was associated under the current
tax at hand? well, at that level, should i have an easy choice to make
whether i use layout 1 ( say 2 col where SB on the right ) or layout 2
( where sidebar on the left ) or layout 3 ( no sidebar at all )! why
do we get into the category.php level to pull this off? ( BTW, pls
someone help me out, if i create a custom taxonomy say titled
"places", do i work with places.php, is that a convention? does wp
automatically pick it up, the same way it does as category-slug.php
gets picked up. or do i add a slug into the custom taxonomy page as
sluge=places, and call it as category-places.php? i'm in complete
black on this one. )

going back to the generic layout solution for all the custom
taxonomies, do you have any ideas as to how to pull this off? or do
you still think, no need to worry about that cause it does not really
render itself as a global need for those who want to use wp as a cms?







What about custom taxonomy X that require 1 col layout?  what about
custom taxonomy y that require 2 col layout? Should not any custom
tax. ( including cats) benefit from the  original idea of layout - so
that the solution is universal? wouldn't it be nicer to have it as a
solution so that whenever we need to add a new category/or any new
custom taxonomy, we should be able to select from layout template that
offers the same benefits and convenience that page templates offer?
	
this may require more work obviously.


	

some find the idea, it may prove useful in opening up interesting possibilites,

Sorry about my last long email. I did not mean to send it that
unmature. it was sent due to an unintentional enter key stroke on
gmail interface without realizing that send button had the focus at
that time.

Basically it comes down to this,

Categories and Tags and Taxes are identical what can be done for one can be done for another. Generically referee to as terms.

Currently the wp_terms table has no meta or place to store it. Resulting in the database needing to be changed. Generally updating a database breaks lots (refer to discussions post 2.1, 2.3, and 2.5)

In experience the core team digs their heels in the sand on changing the database unless absolutely necessary.

This matter is the biggest hurdle from a plugin being able to do what you want.

From there if the plugin is popular or someone wants the write the code it may end up in core.

It is not categories being un important at all as taxes are a key feature in WordPress.

From my experience I think what you'd find as soon as you got theme provided layouts for categories would be the need for category meta and some of the other things that are provided by Pages (Pages are implemented as posts where post_type='page'.) For example you'd probably find plugins that you'd want to apply but that wouldn't work because there was not post to apply to.  FWIW.

I'd say they don't dig their heels in the sand, it's more like they cast their legs in steel-reinforced concrete.  Just sayin... :-)

Can WordPress use InnoDB? If so, how do I tell WordPress to use
InnoDB? If I have an existing database, how do I migrate it to InnoDB?
I tried simply mysqldump-ing and loading back the tables but with
ENGINE=innodb instead of ENGINE=myisam, but that failed because
FULLTEXT indexes are not supported by innodb. Thanks in advance.

AFAIK, WP doesn't create FULLTEXT indexes. These have probably been
created by a plugin.

Agreed.  Your method for conversion should work fine if you drop the 
full text searches first.   There are various trade-offs between InnoDB 
and MyISAM. You need to choose the one that meets your requirement best.

I can confirm that you convert MU installs with hundreds of blogs 
without a problem.  Just make sure you watch your resources while you 
are doing it. Running both InnoDB and MyISAM database engines will 
obviously take up more memory, but that's easy to forget.  You're using 
two sets of buffers and logs et al. So when you switch over, you may 
want to switch all databases over.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Relative vs. Absolute URLs stored in db
Message-ID: <AANLkTima6ALDEay6Te57eSyqEuWHkUYWOXeKbcWMTihA@mail.gmail.com>

It doesn't seem to make sense to me that the absolute URLs are stored in the
db. Shouldnt those be formed by concatenating the siteurl and/or blog values
which are already stored in the db.

The main advantage of this would be that migrating a blog would be MUCH
simpler and straightforward. This problem is encountered when moving a site,
but much more of interest to me is when pushing from a dev environment to a
staging or production environment. Currently I would have
http://localhost/example as a site url which gets written to many places in
the database but when I want to push to http://example.com I have to use the
Search and Replace plugin to try and change all the URL occurrences. I have
to do this everytime I check my development code out of my version control
to another system. Seems like a bad hack considering I could be blogging
about tech and have "localhost" text in the content of a post that i do NOT
want to replace. I need to perform the operation on the content body because
media contained in the library is referenced with absolute URLs.

I just want to open up the discussion because there is possibly a good
reason to do it the way its done now, or a plan in place to change it, that
I am not aware of. Is it too expensive to do the concatenation at runtime?
That's the only benefit I could see from the current method.

doesn't seem like anyone addressed the specific issue of absolute URLs in
that thread (unless i'm missing something).

syncing the database is probably a complex organization policy controlled
operation, but what i'm asking is much simpler. it doesn't matter if you
want to sync ur db from dev->prod or prod->dev, relative URLs are more
robust and functional than absolute URLs in a CMS.

can anyone cite a reason for storing absolute URLs? i am really surprised
that for a product like wordpress that is becoming useful for such large
scale deployments that this issue wasn't already addressed, could it really
just be historical and nobody was bothered enough by it to change it?

my apologies, im sort of a n00b with mailing lists (aren't these considered
antiques yet?) so i didnt see that the thread continued further, the first
part in the archives made no mention of URLs just database syncing.

i now see both sides of the argument, and i would prefer the relative URLs
still to be honest - the argument still stands that it is more versatile
that way and not just for dev needs. but i see how this is something that
will probably not be changed anytime soon. the crash course in release
management with hosts file modifications was useful and i will try to follow
that method.

                        ));

...it correctly returns all eight posts.

according to the codex page[1], showposts was deprecated in favour of
posts_per_page, so surely these two queries should return exactly the same
result?

i tried adding 'nopaging' => true to the first query but it still only
returns five posts. what's also odd is that five doesn't relate to any of my
site's settings (i have 10 in the 'reading' options), so i've no idea where
it comes from.

i've reproduced this exact same behaviour on two sites with all other
plugins & filters disabled, so there does certainly seem to be a bug (or
maybe bugs) in there, but i'm not sure what exactly.

anyone else encountered this?

i couldn't find a trac ticket, let me know if there is one already,
otherwise i'll open one if this is definitely a bug.

cheers

I've encountered this also and so my habit is to set both to -1. The way the
documentation reads, I think it sounds like a bug too.

I agree with you about relative URL's but there are many who want to keep
them absolute. It's a stalemate really so it's not likely that will change.
Your best bet is a plugin to help make the migration smoother.

I have recently found the same issue: numberposts or showposts both work where posts_per_page does not.

Codex describes get_posts as defaulting to 5 posts returned, which is not intuitive.  With no limit defined, expected result was that get_posts would return all posts matching the specified criteria.

Regards,


Mikel

Agreed, but changing it would most certainly cause issues with existing installations, themes and plugins that assume the default.  Sadly, it is what it is.

Just flicked onto the list to post the same question. 

Also seeing the same bug:
$resources = get_posts(array('post_type' => 'tsn_resource',
'posts_per_page' => '-1'));
returns only 5 items out of a possible 50ish.

As I need all posts, I can get it to work by running:
$resources = get_posts(array('post_type' => 'tsn_resource',
'posts_per_page' => '-1', 'nopaging' => true));

Showposts is deprecated in favor of posts_per_page, and in my case
pagination isn't required, making 'nopaging' the better option.

Either method will temporarily solve the problem while the bug exists.

So far I haven't found issues with InnoDB. I've found that you can even do
the conversion on a live DB without any serious issues, PHPMyAdmin lets you
do it at the per-table level, so if it's just one site that's an easy method
(Sequel Pro on mac, a better PHPMyAdmin alterniative, also lets you do it
that way.).

The main thing to watch out for is the special system variables MySQL uses
to control resources for InnoDB. If you've been tuning a dedicated server
for MyISAM (key_buffer_size and friends) then the default InnoDB values
might be way too low, leading to atrocious performance until you up the
values to reflect the actual amount of ram available to you. Specifically
I'd read about and assess your server's values for:

innodb_buffer_pool_size ? The most important value, if you are only using
InnoDB then almost all your ram should be available to the innodb buffer
pool.

innodb_log_buffer_size ? Affects the historical memory of InnoDB in case of
failure, larger values mean slower recovery time (Percona recommends 4mb)

So far I've had excellent experiences with the switch to InnoDB, if you have
even a moderate amount of writing to the database InnoDB saves you a lot of
headaches from queued up queries due to MyISAM's table-level locking.

Message-ID: <006101cb95b9$f1cfd8d0$d56f8a70$@krusible.com>

WordPress API's cron feature uses the website traffic to trigger scheduled
tasks. Is it possible that multiple instances of cron be triggered
simultaneously in a very high trafficked website because all the cron checks
pass at the same time?

In an extremely unlikely case, yes. There is a bit of a race condition
here. But it's tiny. The spawn_cron() function sets a transient called
doing_cron which it also checks for. Thus, if two hits launched at
almost the same moment, one of them will set the doing_cron transient
first, blocking the other one from continuing. The window for two to
run at once and both succeed is about as small as possible.

I struggled with simultaneous execution problems a bit. One solution, I believe, is to use actual unix cron to trigger wp cron, but I turned to mysql named locks. They're quicker to set than a table update and automatically reset after the connection that created them is dropped. 

Usage example in one of my plugins here:

It could be made smaller by using actual cron to call the script, as
then you're guaranteed that it will only run once.

Yes, you can do that if you have the ability to set up real cron jobs.
Just define DISABLE_WP_CRON to true in your wp-config.php, then set up
a cron job to execute wp-cron.php however often you want it to run.

Be careful with that. MySQL locks are held on a *server* basis, not a
database one. So if you happen to share the same server as other
installations, they can block you if the locks have the same name.

Best to use the DB name in the lock name to prevent this sort of thing.

Remove "array" there and it'll function as expected.

The good news is, WordPress 3.2 should be PHP5 only..

I didn't know about this parameter type casting...
Is it equivalent to:
myfunc( $result = array() ) {
        $result = (array)$result;
        ...
}

?

It just throws a fatal error if a non array variable is put into the
function. I have no idea why I use it tho.

here it is:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/yet-another-mass-management-script

The repository this script belongs to is currently private.

This is not a plugin, not a theme, not a patch ...
I think that:

1) the ML should allow attachment (maybe limited to 10 kB ?)
2) the "code" markup on the forums should offer a way to display the text
overflowing.

For example:
<a href="#" onClick="$(#thread .post).style('overflow').toggle()">
Display post full width
</a>

The forums aren't the best place to post large chunks of code either.

No, no, and definitely no. This mailing list goes out to thousands of people.

If you want to publish code, perhaps you should publish it on your own
website. Or turn it into a plugin. Or whatever. Just mailing it out to
people or posting it on forums you don't control doesn't make a whole
lot of sense.

I don't because I hate mayself having to create an account to give simple
plugin feedback/patch on every personal blog.
I think that when talking about WP we should use the common WP
infrastructure, communication (and if needed authentification) system.

Hi,
I searched Trac but, surprisingly I can not find any trace of a report
there but I'm hundred-percent sure it has been reported before:

- Create category A.
- Create category B, subcategory of A
- Set B as parent of A.

get_category() calls _get_children() which recurse infinitely.
It is obvious but the GUI should not allow this kind of things.
(or, maybe better, _get_children() should be given a static stack
storing ID and ignoring those already in it)

Does a human-search-engine can point me to the place it has been
discussed ?

Thank you !

As a side note, digging around I found the following (old) :
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7267

So shouldn't this changeset:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/8299
been affected also (use of wp_check_term_hierarchy_for_loops())
instead of $visited ? (I'm not quite sure anyway)

Type hinting has its place.  I think it's especially helpful for an
API.  Suppose I have a method like so:

public function add( User $user )
{
...
}

It's immediately clear that the add method must receive a -User- object.

Type hinting also encourages good code design by preventing me, the
developer, from trying to make one method do too many things, which
among other problems makes the code hard to test and to debug.  For
example, that add() method will throw a fatal error if someone tries
to pass it a user's ID integer or login slug.

Message-ID: <EA0A62B8-DBF3-4F42-8856-23BCDFF9C9F4@gmail.com>

Hi all

I would appreciate advice on what the definitive way is of handling data received from forms, and storing it in a plugin's database table. Specifically, text boxes and text areas. What filters should be run on the data prior to it being inserted in to the database, and what filters should be run on the data prior to display? I appreciate that many filters can be run, especially on output, so I am hoping someone can provide a list of the essentials to do it safely.

To give some context, this example text box would be the name of a doodad (similar to a post's title), and the text area would be the content associated with this doodad (incl. possible HTML, similar to a post's content). This is meant to be an abstract, easy-to-understand example; saying "use custom post types" will not help me learn which filters to use :)

I'm asking because I'm reviewing the way some of my plugins stores and sanitises its data, and while I think I have a good understanding, I would greatly appreciate clarification from the collective geniuses on this list. Thanks.

Regards
Paul Gibbs

Subject: [wp-hackers] Achieving faceted navigation
Message-ID: <AANLkTik3qeAtodk--VBBhdAOC0dRYdR8sZaiVkkFnoth@mail.gmail.com>

When dealing with a large subject such as Health or Sports etc
(whatever the case be),  you'd naturally want to start out right, and
as right as possible as far as your navigation systems are concerned
and that brings the matter down to site organization & content
categorization.

But, since categorization of content is a very subjective task and
humans have so many different angles to see things from, the
categorization challenge usually becomes a mind-boggling task. I
realize & accept that there are many right ways of achieving great
categorizations but I also do know there are definitely the wrong ways
to go at it. Usually, either the lack of knowledge or pressuring
deadlines may be the culprit.

And down the road, the unevitable may hit home and when you look back,
you realize that you could have achieve certain things in so many
different but easier ways, this is true not just from your user's
point of view, but also, you, the developer's point of view!

That's the time, it really hits home when you realize, how important
it was, to decide correctly on what should have been a top level
category, a sub category, a custom taxonomy, or a tag! But at that
time, it may be too late to fix things...

My question to you is to find out your approaches towards minimizing
this what seems to be a universal problem... I obviously cannot expect
a complete solution from any of you who happen to find this concept
interesting... but I can't goo wrong by trying to pick some of the
best brains in the industry.

Here is the bare-bone question!
What do you do to minimize the damage that we tend to create at the
early stages (as I described above) and what do you do maximize the
flexibility down the road that we all wish to possess in our hands?

But before you do that, I would like to underline another aspect that
is really BIG for me and that is to be able to achieve faceted
navigation - obviously without duplicating cats, posts, or any work
for myself.

What I mean by the faceted nav is this;

I have a horizontal nav at the nav and I got items such as
============================================================================
Browse By Media | Browse By Audience | Browse By Proficiency | Browse
By Popularity |  and of course the unavoidable! Browse By "Topics"
=============================================================================

Under Browse By Media, you may have videos, pod casts, articles etc,

Under Browse By Proficiency Level, you may have beginner,
intermediate, advanced...

and Under Browse By Audiences, you may have kids, youth, women, men, seniors...

of course Browse By Topics is where the million-dollar question is,
but that's very much subject matter specific so we leave that aside-
at least for the time being...

The idea with faceted nav. is that the visitors may navigate the site
by clicking on say Videos and then view lots of videos across all
kinds of available topics.

At that point, the audience, the proficiency level, popularity should
be offered as filters to the user, so that he/she can filter down the
videos displayed across those topics to fit to his/her needs.

Of course, with the same site and database, user should also be able
to navigate thru your site with the default facet in view, that is
topic based.

In that case, he then selects a topic from the Topics listing, and
then the next page he see would be one which show cases all the
featured videos, pod casts, articles, apps etc, etc - all dealing with
the same subject matter that user is focusing on.

Again, at that moment, you'd want to be able to offer your user
similar filters, but this time By Media Type, By Audience and By
Proficieny Level.

So if that's the scenario, the question is...

To achieve this, what's the most straightforward approach you would take?

My very raw take on this ( just to get this email going ) is the following.

=====================================
Approach 1
=====================================

1- Screw the topical categories... dump all posts into the all-mighty
"uncategorized" and get going...

2- come up with 3-4 semantic top level cats such as

*** Media   ( Video, Article, Pod Cast, Picture Gallery, App ) so that
visitors can view the site from a particular media type point of view

*** Audience ( Kids, Youth, Men, Women, Seniors ) so that the right
group can filter down what matters most to them.

*** Proficiency Level ( Beginner, Intermediate, Adcanced )  so that
visitors of different levels of knowledge do not get frustrated by
seeing either too trivial or to advanced stuff )

and always place your posts into all of these semantic cats properly.

3- Tag your posts like hell.

4- After a few hundreds of posts (or when things start to get clear),
do a tag cloud and see whereabouts your stuff really is accumulating
and then come up with the proper categorization ( and subs ) to
replace the "uncategorized" top level category with.

At that point, you may use a plug in such as "tag to categories" to
start populating the top level topics...

5- And if you want to create bigger sections, you may do so by
creating some more pages. I mean WordPress Pages... Come up with 5 to
10 of them, name them marketing-smart so that they are
visitor-grabbing and SEO friendly etc.. and make them show case some
custom content for their respected landing pages, by tapping into
crazy complex SQL queries that pulls posts from various cats, Media
Types with lots of multiple loops...


And then launch the site.

=====================================
Approach 2
=====================================

Do the same, but use Custom Taxonomies for step 2 instead.


=====================================
Approach 3
=====================================

that's you. I'm all ears.

With WP 3.1 coming along, I would definitely go with as many custom
taxonomies as necessary.

See Otto's post to understand why:

You've hit the nail on the head.  Of the top 3 things I've spent my professional career on categorization has been one of them and you are definitely seeing the complexity clearly.

What you've described here with Approach 2 was what I was thinking about writing as I started to read your email, so IMO I think you've nailed it.

Hope this helps.

Best practices:

- use the Settings API http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API which is 
standardized and makes it easy to hook in validating/sanitizing functions

- sanitize functions: several functions are available in 
wp-includes/formatting.php. Page 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Data_Validation has good stuff

Rich,
I've had problems with wp.org using the trunk version of the plugin  
instead of the most recently tagged version of the plugin.

I agree Scribu.. but when it comes to performance and ease of use, can
we also say cus. tax way is superior over category way? that's one
area, I am unable to gather in this matter.

example

say, your post X goes into
cat 23 ( topics>sports>basketball ),
and also in cat 67 ( places>la>staples center),
and also in cat 99 ( people>basketball players>kobe ),
and also in cat 45 ( media>video) ,
and also in cat 29 ( quality>topnotch
and the post X is also been tagged as "Awesome Finishes"

as opposed to

your post X goes into
cat 23 ( topics>sports>basketball ),
and also been tagged with "staples" center under cus. tax. [places]>[la]
and also been tagged with "kobe" under cus. tax. [people]>basketball players
and also been tagged with "video" under cus. tax. [media]
and also been tagged with "top notch" under cus. tax. [quality]
and the post X is also been tagged as "Awesome Finishes"

now, looking at these two examples, both approaches are trying to
sort-out the post into proper buckets so that we can pull the posts
when we need to for different mind/user sets.


the question is....

when you need to do lots of multiple loops on a page template that
does things like

give me all posts that's been categorized in so and so, been tagged
with blah, blah and blah and also been tagged under cus. taxonomy a,
which way is better or easier...

how do you do pull the records say,
give me all videos, that's top notch and awesome finishes across all sports...

which way would be easier/faster/flexible/etc/etc using cats vs cus. taxes?

Read this to understand things better:
http://ottopress.com/2010/wordpress-3-1-advanced-taxonomy-queries/

The advanced query would be basically the same for both approaches.
Except in one you'd use the category taxonomy everywhere, and in the
other you'd use different taxonomies. The resulting query to the
database would have the same set of joins and such and would take an
equal amount of effort.

> which way would be easier/faster/flexible/etc/etc using cats vs cus. taxes?

They're basically identical. The difference is that custom taxonomies
is easier to manage from the editing screen and looks better than
showing everything in a big hierarchy of categories. Each taxonomy
would have it's own meta box instead of having everything lumped
together as a category.

The "plugin display" data doesn't update at the same time as the
plugin zips get rebuilt and such. So it's highly likely that the
downloads will appear before the new info appears in the Plugin
display. This is a consequence of us using multiple servers. Only one
server updates the plugin display, whereas they all update the zips
for download.

So sometimes, yes, the data shown will be old for a while. Generally,
you just have to wait for it to happen. :)

and as if my magic... it suddenly appears. I waited 2 days before 
reporting it as well!

Maybe someone could put together a wiki page explaining all the 
possible delays when updating (or add it to the plugin developer 
page?) and how long to wait before flagging it up.

Otto,

How about post-formats... can that change the equation? , post-formats
are really nearing the border-lines as a cat or as a custom taxonomy
one could call Media Type.

In my example case, for instance, Media is used almost identical to
the way post-formats are.. remember, sub items under media were things
like gallery,image,video,audio..

keeping this in mind, is there then a need to create a cat or cus.
taxonomy for media types anymore, you think?

BTW, your post (
http://ottopress.com/2010/wordpress-3-1-advanced-taxonomy-queries/ )
is what I call a classic. Great job.. but I need to read this a few
more times to "squeeze" the real "juice" out of it.

Post formats are a taxonomy, just like category or tag. No difference there.

> taxonomy for media types anymore, you think?

Depends on what you use it for. Post formats are intended to be used
to modify how posts are displayed on the site. If you're using them
for that, then that would be fine. If you're wanting to use them for
categorization, then a custom taxo might be better.

WordPress 3.0.3 has been released. This is a security release for all
previous WordPress versions.

This release fixes issues in XML-RPC where which under certain circumstances
allowed Author- and Contributor-level users to improperly edit, publish, or
delete posts. This release only affects sites which have XML-RPC enabled.

Those wishing to continue to test the 3.1 Beta, please note that the
currently nightly build contains the fixes that were included in 3.0.3.

I'd advise you to update your plugin compatibility as appropriate. Plugins
should be unaffected by this release.

Release announcement: http://wordpress.org/news/2010/12/wordpress-3-0-3/.

Thanks,

 Andrew Nacin

I see that now when your mark plugin as compatible with one version, all
versions from that branch will be reported as compatible.

For example, plugins that are marked as compatible with 3.0, 3.0.1 and 3.0.2
are now marked as compatible up to 3.0.3.

This isn't always going to be the case, but I do agree there is room for
improvement here.

We're going to work on a way to cause the plugin compatibility system to
treat certain releases (those we manually specify) as equal.

On a bit of a related subject, I have a question.  Is there an online resource with the step-by-step of (or could someone enlighten the process of) how a Security Release rolls out from start to finish? There are a lot of users that are questioning the need for 2 releases in such a short time and having a detailed explanation (I think) would serve as a fantastic resource as to the why (and not just to "here's a new release go download it" which may offput some users).

An explanation would be a great idea,  especially to help us when dealing with recent converts.

Although I agree a published explanation of the importance is a great
idea; with our 1-click upgrade built into core I'm surprised there's
an issue.

I don't imagine many users have a problem installing software updates
on their computers... Or maybe they do!?

Sorry, maybe I mis-spoke as to what I meant.

I know that there's release posts and changesets, but I mean more of a "security release lifecycle".

Etc: Someone finds a bug, it gets reported to trac, some things happen, then a security release is done.

I'd like to fill in the blanks as to what happens from start to finish and get a complete look at "this is what happens when we find a bug that is urgent enough to get a security release".

Make sense?

People are hesitant to update - especially if they have large sites with lots of plugins.  Or they've updated back when it wasn't so easy and had a bad experience.  For some reason people are just hesitant to respond to that notice I've seen.

In my personal experience most non techies ignore software updates.
They've been trained by IT folks and Windows that an update may break
something, so they don't upgrade.


But, I think the Mitch wanted to know the triage process.

Maybe we should add a feature where WordPress could auto-update security
releases silently.  Since they're patches to plug vulnerabilities in core,
they don't affect the APIs used by plug-ins or themes.  I know you have to
put some thought in doing a major version update (i.e. 3.0.X to 3.1) because
new features and changed APIs might break certain things on your site ...
but a security release doesn't have that, and (arguably) is more important
as an urgent update.

Windows will auto-install security updates.  So will Mac.  With WordPress
being depended on more and more as an intranet/blog/internet/cms operating
system, it only makes sense that vital updates should be capable of
automation.  Then we wouldn't have to worry about the non-techies ignoring
the security updates.  We'd also have fewer "my blog was hacked because I
waited a week to upgrade to plug a well-documented security hole in my site"
support requests.

It was the process that I was referring to so that what caused 2 security updates in such close succession could be properly explained.  The main questions I get from newer tech savvy users are: 

did the first update brake things (also read 'not properly tested so we'll wait')? 

Was the first only a partial release and have we more coming (ie we'll wait for the last of these)? 

From tech savvy users the landscape is rather bleaker.

+1 as long as a) it's an optional setting  and b) rubbish like the capital p dangit function never make there way through this route.

Please don't report it to Trac. That's a huge no-no. Security
vulnerabilities should never be reported to any project in the open.

Security issues should go to security at wordpress.org. See
http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security.

Basic lifecycle: Vulnerability is reported to that email, which goes to the
core team and a few others. It is reviewed and discussed privately. If
legitimate, a fix is privately prepared. We privately decide on a timeline
and method for release, based on the severity of the vulnerability and
whether it has already been disclosed elsewhere. We then test it privately
until we are ready to commit it and offer a public release.

In this case, we were alerted to this vulnerability late last week, and took
appropriate steps over the days that followed to confirm and isolate the
issue, prepare a fix, do a full audit of the capability checks in XML-RPC,
and test everything thoroughly.

Security vulnerabilities are rare. 3.0.2 was released a few days before this
one was reported to us, hence two releases in 8 days. That's the only
explanation we have for two releases in a short time period. It's not like
we planned that.

I also described 3.0.2's lifecycle in a previous post to wp-hackers:
http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-December/036276.html.
While 3.0.3's lifecycle spanned about six days, 3.0.2 was released four
hours after we were notified. Those are probably the two extremes.

I think it should be an option that is disabled by default.  Then, if/when a
security/maintenance fix is published we could expose an "install future
maintenance releases automatically" option in the UI if it's not already
enabled.  This way, it's highly unlikely someone who doesn't know what
they're doing will turn it on by mistake.

The Wordpress => WordPress filter is a filter ... meaning it's an
API/feature change.  Filters, hooks, etc wouldn't be included in
security/maintenance releases, only major ones.

No. While they might have sounded similar, the fixes in 3.0.2 and 3.0.3 were
completely different and wholly unrelated.

No. The issues fixed in 3.0.3 was not reported before 3.0.2 was released.
There are no outstanding vulnerabilities that we are sitting on. Those would
have been released with 3.0.3.

We don't like the double-release any more than you do.

I don't believe there's any doubt on this list that such releases are important.  We all know, and very, very much appreciate, the work that goes into keeping things running as far as security releases (because if a vulnerability gets out before it's addressed, we have to unhack client's sites, restore data, etc.).  

I was approaching it from more of the end user who just runs WordPress because someone told them to, set it up for them, or who just doesn't understand the why.  I agree with the statement below that (not hating or anything) Windows Updates tends to scare people because they see horror stories about how updates have gone wrong and shut down a whole system. It's nice to have a "this is why things are done this way" we can take back to clients or end-users and point them to a blog post or tweet that gives them the information quickly.

Mike, Yes, the approach 2 looks/feels/seems better. but... let's put a
little twist to the matter and re-look at it.

When we stick to approach 2, we are using thee custom taxonomies for
our needs for post classifications for "Media", "Audience",
"Proficiency level"

but what about step 4? are u fine with that?

step 4 was this;

step 4- After a few hundreds of posts (or when things start to get clear),
do a tag cloud and see whereabouts your stuff really is accumulating
and then come up with the proper **CATEGORIZATION** ( and subs ) to
replace the "uncategorized" top level category with.

....

What's the alternative to compare with?

here it is;

step 4- After a few hundreds of posts (or when things start to get clear),
do a tag cloud and see whereabouts your stuff really is accumulating
and then come up with the proper ***CLASSIFICATION*** ( and subs ) to
*****start building a new taxonomy called Topics.****. With this
approach,  you will still end up keeping the things as "uncategorized"
as far category taxonomy is concerned but use custom taxonomies all
the way to pull your site off nothing but custom taxes.

...

Basically, what we are doing here is to completely ignore category
taxonomy from the get go and to the launch and use a custom taxonomy
called topics as a replacement.

Now I'm sure that most maybe all of you ask, why would I want to do that?
After all, category is just another taxonomy (which happens to be
built in and there is nothing wrong with it ) AND we are using our
replacement custom taxonomy "topics" exactly the same way that we
would with category>topics approach.

yes, it is true, but knowing that does not help me understand the key
differences in between the two.

I'm trying to understand the consequential differences of using one
versus the other, and this particular example ( granted it seems odd)
just serves me very well in seeing the difference (if there are any -
really).

As far as I know, with cats, you get a whole lot of function set to do
the certain things... for example, your posts have the ability to do
next/prev stuff within a cat.. and maybe URL wise you get some
tructures, may be SEO wise category urls are more favored?? plus, with
using cats, I'm not ending up wasting a utility that WP already is
coming with. perhaps these are the benefits of taking the category
taxonomy for the purpose. ( if there are more benefits, please add
here ---> )

but, on the other hand, if we abandon the cats all the way (and leave
things in the uncategorized ALWAYS), and instead, we work with custom
taxonomy called "topics", we may be looking at WP a whole different
way when we want to use WP   as a CMS.

basically, what i am saying, when going with this approach, from a
coding and/or mind set point of view, are there any benefits at all?

If given a choice I'd go with the custom taxonomy because I like to reserve the otherwise too-generic "categories" for "Posts" ($post_type=='post').  

It seems to me that many people overuse  $taxonomy=='category' and then get into an issues of coupling where their categories for posts are different than their categories for other post types.  Unless semantically they are using the same categorization for those other post types, such as if all post types really are content items but different types of content and then category can be used as a major site structuring mechanism.   I'm working on a client project right now where the offshore team used category before I got on the project and they would have been better off having used a custom taxonomy instead.

Also, I think that most sites with 10 or more top level categories have too many:

Hope this helps.

from above, I hear you say, it is OK to not use cats at all, u seem to
entertain the idea of with cus. taxes all the way...   that's point
#1.

>> It seems to me that many people overuse  $taxonomy=='category' and then get into an issues of coupling where their categories for posts are different than their categories for other post types.

interestingly, we would then be on the other edge of the spectrum that
is no use of $taxonomy=='category' ! u sure there are no harms going
this way?

from above, I am getting confused. for my example, r u saying it is OK
to use category? if so, doesn't the use of cats conflict with what I
hear from you on point #1?

>>Also, I think that most sites with 10 or more top level categories have too many:

Agree..  that's the result of complicated thinking as opposed to
simplified thinking. it is odd but very easy to come up with a
complicated category system, it almost takes no time/brain. but it
takes a whole lot of experience & intelligence to simplify it.  Enough

In summary, categories are just a built-in taxonomy so either will work as long as you don't overload one taxonomy when you should be using multiple.

There may be other issues that other's know about but if so I'm unaware of them.

You should try to discourage this attitude in your newer tech savvy 
friends.  If you hold off on updating, it should be because the 
particular details of the vulnerability don't apply to the site's 
situation not because there were two security releases within a short 
period of time.  Delaying the application of a security update because 
there might be another hole fixed soon is like saying "I'm not going to 
block this kick to my head, because I think I might be taught another 
block real soon now."  When updating a site is as easy as it is for tech 
and non-tech alike, it should just be done.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=_A+AD-1tiHYcJSh0_etPbuLpCBuDew5Lp4ECn@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to start what will probably turn out to be a premature
discussion, namely that of switching core development to a distributed
version control system.

== Scenario ==

I'm a developer (without commit access) who wants to improve a certain
feature in the WordPress core.

It doesn't even have to be a big enhancement, like the rework I had to do in
my GSoC project (ajaxify the admin list tables), just something that
requires touching more than a dozen lines of code.

= Current workflow =

Initial phase:

 1. I do a svn checkout of trunk.
 2. I make my modifications.
 3. I generate a patch and upload it to the ticket.

Feedback phase:

 4. Other devs apply my patch and test.
 5. I make improvements and update the patch.
 6. Goto step 4.

Maintenance phase:

 7. Update patch against latest trunk and re-upload it.

Integration phase:

 8. A lead dev commits my patch.


= Better workflow =

Initial phase:

 1. I fork the main repo.
 2. I make my modifications and commit to my fork.
 3. I issue a pull request to the main repository.

Feedback phase:

 4. Other devs clone my fork, test and review individual commits.
 5. I make improvements and do further commits on my fork.
 6. Goto step 4.

Maintenance phase:

 7. I periodically merge changes from the main repository.

Integration phase:

 8. A lead dev merges in all or some commits from my fork to the main
repository.

== Discussion ==

Git + assembla for project management? Not as sexy as github but it
works especially for PM/ issue tracking

But both are heavy reinvestment in time.

Maybe we start small with akismet if we are allowed?

Yeah, I like mercurial too, but does it have an open web interface? I know
about bitbucket.org.

Would be nice, I don't like svn, for some reason I could never checkout the

I know the only reason I have put a plugin up is because of SVN as it's always seemed a bigger PITA than Git.

hgweb.cgi and hgwebdir.cgi are a part of the core Hg distribution.
There's an extensive plugin that allows a swap-out of SVN for Hg in
Trac. Atlassian (who just bought Bitbucket) have Hg support in JIRA.
I've not looked at other options for a bit, but I've liked my
interactions with Hg much better than git. The Hg devs seem to have a
mindset that's more in line with the way SVN works, at least from a UI
perspective.

Ryan,

This will hopefully get you started. For the Password reset email look into the wp-login.php file in your install root. Around line 204-205 you wil see two filter called 

	$title = apply_filters('retrieve_password_title', $title);
	$message = apply_filters('retrieve_password_message', $message, $key);

These allow you to alter the title/subject and the actual message. 

I know there are other emails sent out from the WP system based on different user actions. Again, this should get you started in a direction. 

P-

Ryan,
I would suggest using a language file to customize the text, just as people use language files to translate WP. 

For SMTP, a simple search of the plugins repository will reveal a few plugins that will do the trick.

Most (not all) emails sent by WordPress either have filters you can use
(like Paul mentions) or are pluggable, so you can create your own versions,
e.g.

if ( ! function_exists('wp_notify_postauthor') ) :
    function wp_notify_postauthor ( $comment_id, $comment_type='' ) {
        // do stuff...
        // ...then call wp_mail
    }
endif;

If you want to be super cool, you could just use my HTML Emails plugins:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/html-emails/ ;)

Have you seen Gitorious? I think the project management features are far
superior to GitHub.

http://gitorious.org/

Back when GitHub just had plain pull requests (which is an equivalent of
a message saying "please pull from me"), Gitorious already had merge
requests, which specify exactly which commits would be merged, shows you
the result of merging the commits (i.e. unified diff), allows feedback
and discussion (including commenting on individual lines), and allows
you to update your merge request.

Example:

http://gitorious.org/statusnet/mainline/merge_requests/1065

And of course it's open source, which is another thing it has over GitHub.

Just wanted to add that there's no reason the plugins would have to be
done at the same time as WordPress itself. I'm sure that'll be a huge
undertaking.

Even just offering an official git mirror of the main repository would
be a good place to start, so that people don't have to maintain their
own. Then eventually the git mirror can become the official repository,
or create a new one, whichever.

We couldn't find a git mirror that was up-to-date _and_ had tags so we
had to make our own: https://github.com/dxw/wordpress

I'm sure this won't be popular, but what if plugin authors had to  
resubmit their plugins? It would probably help weed out a ton of old  
plugins that are no longer relevant.

Lots of times changes for the good aren't popular at first despite the 
long term benefit.

It might weed out those plug-ins that are obsolete and abandoned by the
original developers.  But some plug-ins aren't being "actively" developed
because they still work and don't need any new features.  Forcing the devs
to resubmit a plug-in that hasn't changed in a year or two would be a major
PITA for some.

On the other hand, maybe culling inactive plug-ins from the repository by
forcing a massive resubmit would be a good thing.  We'd have a better idea
of how many plug-ins are available based on how many are resubmitted.  But
I'd still want to keep the old SVN repo available *somewhere* for archive
purposes ...

Could we form a short term team to work on helping plugin authors get 
their plugins into the system?

GIT is a wonderful tool.  It is great to work with.  Though I'd love a 
cost free switch to GIT, that's not an option.  It would be a lot of 
work, probably at the expense of a feature or three in some release.  In 
the end, I doubt the benefit will be there.  However I don't work with 
the repositories enough to experience much pain or benefit either way. 
So my opinion on this doesn't carry much weight.

As far as windows clients are concerned, I've had the opportunity to 
play with TortoiseGIT lately. It's come a long way.  The only major 
problem I had with it is that the default buffer size was too small to 
allow branch creation and massive checkins to succeed.  It does all 
common tasks well.  Rarer branch management tasks seem to have multiple 
ways to get to them and you have to know the right way to do things 
through experience.  Fortunately all mistakes can be rolled back.  A few 
years ago TortoiseGIT was not a viable choice.  Now, it is.

(Additionally it installs a full suite of Linux commands.  So when I 
screw up and type ls, find or grep on my home machine, it makes no 
difference.  Though using 'ls -Al' on a Windows 7 box just feels creepy.)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Pages still visible to audience after setting it back
	to "Draft"?
Message-ID: <4D0122EF.3010302@wpseek.com>

Hey there,

I've been told there's some strange behaviour on how WP 3 handles draft 
posts, and I'm not sure wether it's a bug or wanted behaviour.

When creating a page, setting the status to "Draft" and saving the page, 
you can preview it by opening ?page_id=694&preview=true Works fine so 
far. Non logged in users cannot see the draft page even if they're 
opening the page directly via ?page_id=694&preview=true or /slug/.

But when a page has been published before, and you set back the status 
of that page to "Draft", non logged in users can suddenly see the page, 
although it's a Draft. Is this desired behaviour? What would be the 
point of changing a page's status from Public to Draft if the audience 
will still be able to view the page by directly opening it through the 
address bar?

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a page (status: Draft (default), Visibility: Public 
(default)), and click "Save".
2. Open the page with a different browser you're non logged into the 
Admin area, e.g. domain.com/draft-page/ You'll get a 404, this is 
desired behaviour.
3. Now publish the page by clicking "Publish" and it should be visible 
to non logged in users, too.
4. Now set the page's status from "Published" to "Draft" and hit "Update 
page".

In opposition to step 1 the page wont return a 404, although it's a 
Draft like in step 1 where it correctly returned a 404 to non logged in 
users.

Bug or feature? :)

Just tested on WP 3.1 (Beta 1 build 16732) and I cannot reproduce this issue
with either posts or pages.

That sounds to me like you are using a caching plugin that doesn't 
properly clear the cached page when the status is changed back to 
draft.  I could see how that condition could easily be missed. Usually 
pages saved as draft won't ever have been visible, so why attempt to 
clear the page cache of something that won't exist.

After the page is demoted to draft, try doing this: 
http://exaple.com/draft-page?foo  and I bet you will get a 404... ?foo 
can be any random characters

Or if you are using wp-cache2, supercache, w3totalcache/whatever try 
clearing all caches  after the you have demoted the post..

For the record, I don't get git. I find it confusing and difficult to use.

Basically, it doesn't make any sense to me why I'd want a local copy
of the repository. How is forking better than working via patches? Why
should I need to work with some piece of repository software just to
make changes?

The patch/diff program is a well understood and well tested piece of
software. I don't have to know SVN or any other type of repo to make a
patch. I can just download the latest ZIP file, make my changes, run
diff over it, then send the diff file.

My problem with it is that it's not really any more difficult to apply
a diff than it is to go through some obscure and hard-to-understand
git-based system.

I grant you that maybe git is easier. But for me, it's harder because
it means that I have to learn an entirely different workflow system
that doesn't make any form of intuitive sense. That takes time to do,
and frankly, I don't want to spend that much time on it. I'd rather
make patches and just get the job done instead.

If you already know how to use SVN and diffs and such, then there is
no benefit to switching to a git-like approach. It's not faster. It's
not really easier. It's certainly a lot more confusing. And in the
end, the same work gets done anyway, either way.

BTW, I agree with nacin that this is most likely a matter of the
associated tools just not being up to par yet. SVN has been around a
long time, while GIT is relatively new by comparison. The tools I've
seen to work with it are all difficult to use and the weird use of
terminology I don't understand (because I don't understand the git
workflow in the first place) makes them difficult and confusing. If
the tools were better, and the terminology was explained well, then
maybe it would make more sense to me.

The advantage of using GIT (or Mercurial, or any other distributed system)
is that you can develop and commit locally, not just to a central
repository.

Take this workflow:

   - You start working on a patch for a small feature and spend a couple of
   hours swimming through code
   - You go out to dinner, do something else, and get wrapped up in another
   project
   - You come back to your patch a week later and work a bit more
   - You work some more a day or two later
   - Then you discover that the small feature is really a major overhaul to
   an existing system, so you buckle down and work even hard
   - When you're just about done, you realize you've made a mistake - adding
   new feature B somehow broke feature A ... but you aren't quite sure what you
   did to break it or, more importantly, when.

With SVN on a dedicated repository, it's easy to just revert changes and
track down your bug.  Core committers to WordPress have access to this and
seem to use it (I see the occasional reversion ... we're not perfect).  But
other developers in the community don't.  And that's where Git helps.  With
the current SVN system, if I stumble upon a bug and try to track down where
I broke the code, I have no revision history to track against because I'm
not actually working with the WordPress repository.  With Git, though, I
have a local copy and I'm constantly committing my changes to that - if I
see something broken, I can track down a specific revision and fix it.

That's the value of Git.

Basic workflow comparison -

SVN:

   - Update working copy
   - Write code
   - Write code
   - Write code
   - Export patch to someone else
   - Patch accepted and committed

Git:

   - Clone repository
   - Write code
   - Commit
   - Write code
   - Commit
   - Write code
   - Commit
   - Request that someone else pulls your changes
   - Changes are committed

I prefer to just write my code correctly the first time, but I get
what you're saying. ;)

I guess I tend to see patches as single purpose, small things. Rarely
do we see patches that add huge new swathes of functionality. And when
they do, it's generally done in entirely new files, then core is
modified only to hook it into the proper places and what not. So I'm
not sure of the value of having a local repo.

Of course, if I wanted a local repo, then it's just a matter of a
minutes to install an SVN server and make one.

The thing that weirds me out is the repo merge process. From what I've
seen on the topic, that "pull" request, if honored, will not only
merge the main patch back in, but also all the changes made locally in
too. That's definitely something we don't want. I don't want to see
your whole development process for your patch. I just want the final
patch. Adding all your local changes and such back in is cluttering
and annoying.

I think moving to distributed scm is a good thing for all.

With that said if some don't want to change their workflow, there is a
solution. git-svn is a tool that comes with git and is a two-way
bridge to svn so I can have the svn history in my git repo and commit
back to svn when I want to merge to that remote. It's a good
intermediate solution if you really want to work in the git workflow
and svn is what you are stuck with.

But the biggest advantage I see is that the notion of "blessed commit
access" would be nullified. Linus put it well in his Google Tech Talk
of 07. You basically look at branches that are proven, already merged,
and possibly have a little fan following already and the acceptance is
simple and painless. The politics of commit access is completely
avoided and more time in the community is spent on coding and adding
features.

As for the plugin repository, asking people to resubmit seems like a
lot to ask, using git-svn for those older ones could be an option
while allowing the newer ones to submit an alternative git repo would
make sense to me.

Although I think that most of the issues I have* with the current 
WordPress development model are not going to be solved with a different 
version control system, I too would welcome distributed version control 
over Subversion.

Personally I like Bazaar (http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/).
It's quite well supported on all major platforms (Windows, Linux and 
OSX) with a nice gui and offers imho a well thought out work-flow. Oh 
and it is nicely integrated with Launchpad(). Bonus points for all of 
this being open source software :)

* For those interested: my issues with the current development model or 
why I sometime ago stopped participating in core related work:

1) No clear guidelines on how the WordPress community may participate in 
the decision process and direction of WordPress
2) no clear guidelines on how one may become a core committer
3) No roadmap as far as I can see
4) Arbitrary and unclear (at least to me) way of handling tickets and 
patches

Bonus: No mandatory brackets for control structures...C'mon that's just 
plain silly.

Feel free to enlighten me if some of these points have already been 
addressed,

Grtz

That's why I don't do core WP code or plugins. I don't get SVN and the patch system. Git's branch model makes way more sense to me. Course is started with Git

This sounds like a plugin, specifically a caching plugin as Brian has
pointed out, especially knowing how WP_Query handles non-public post
statuses. But I'm sending this email as a Public Service Announcement.

If this really was a bug in core, it's information disclosure, and is best
classified as a major vulnerability.

So this shouldn't be reported over a public mailing list. Instead something
like it should go to security at wordpress.org.

Now grant you, this is an obvious false alarm, but it's better to be safe
than sorry.

Thanks!

Here's the thing, I'd need one plugin to send via SMTP, another to do HTML
emails, and still another to support non-standard emails I may want to
send.  I'd much rather just write my own single plugin to do all of that,
keeps things simple for me and shouldn't be too hard.

Now I kinda shot that email off from my phone, now that I am at my computer
I have looked over the source of WP and some of the plugins.  It appears to
me that the function wp_mail() is used to send the emails, and it has
several filters including one called wp_mail.  Now my thinking is this:

1) I can look at the email address it is being sent to and the subject to
gather the details I need to know what type of email it is and who its for
2) I can use the wp_mail filter to get those details and return null values
in their place, like this:

$to = '';
$subject = '';
$message = '';
$headers = '';
$attachments = array ();
return compact('to', 'subject', 'message', 'headers', 'attachments');

3) That should effectively prevent wordpress from sending the mail, then I
can create and send my own.

Does this all sound about right?

Using the SMTP plugin tells wp_mail() to send using SMTP. Then you can create and send your own e-mails using the wp_mail function.

Hi Curtis:

Off List.  I'm really intrigued by what you are saying.  

Have you worked on other open source platforms that used this?  Or do you have other experience with it?  Ever been a core committer on another project?

With Otto in such a position of authority in the community and him being so against it (which is typical for Otto; if it's not his use-case he'll do his best to block it.)  I wonder if we could create another plugin repository whose goal would be to prove the concept?  If so, any ideas how you might go about putting together such an alternate infrastructure?

Thanks in advance for entertaining this "what if" exploration.

Exactly my point, that would require three different plugins, the SMTP
plugin, a plugin to customize the emails with an HTML format, and my own
plugin still to send my other emails.

Hence it just makes sense to add functionality to my plugin to just suppress
wp_mail and send out the emails myself so I have the full control over the
process without hacking the core function.

LOL! :-D

I'm not against it, per se. I've just never understood git, really.
That's all I'm saying. I find it confusing and weird. A good
explanation of it might be helpful, but the ones I've seen are all
confusing to me.

Hey Ryan,

The wp_mail() function is in the 'wp-includes/pluggable.php' file
meaning it can be completely overridden by a plugin. Makes life nice
and simple!

have you seen the one where Linus berates everyone at Google for using svn? Oh, and I think Sussman was in the audience as well. 

Distributed scm is the in thing these days, so a lot of people are on the bandwagon, it's hard to tell when someone has a good case for it, versus RDD (Resume Driven Development).. 

Distributed scm works for a lot of people and a lot of projects, but it's not a switch that's taken lightly, nor should it be.

The PHP 5 symfony project switched from SVN to Git for Symfony 2.0, and they love it.  We did the same here for my own company. Here's what I like about it...

1. I can make changes locally, commit them, and not break the flow of other developers... yet know that i can undo changes atomically.. 

2. I can make a trillion local branches to test out features I want to build, without messing up the master (trunk in svn)..

3. For some reason merging is insanely faster with git, plus local copies are much smaller than SVN. I believe SVN makes a full copy per branch.. so available disk space reduces much faster.

PS: Can we 'filibuster' on this list? :)

Made me laugh out loud too. After a semi crappy day of clients that was 
awesome. Thanks Mike. Since it's on list now anyways I'll respond at 
least initially below,

To answer some of the questions. No I haven't been a core commiter on a 
project. I have contributed to RVM a few times. Specifically I've 
contributed to their site function and documentation. I've also forked 
and sent a pull request for a project management system that escapes me 
right now as well as using it (for the first time) in the RailsRumble 
'09 (with no command line experience and as the designer). I also use it 
regularly in teams for any Rails work I do the frontend on.

I use Git daily as my version control software for all projects.

My issues with Subversion, which may inform anyways, start at I don't 
get it. While the patch system may seem totally understandable to some 
coming at it from the Git mindset it makes little sense to me. To my 
mind it makes more sense that I clone the whole repository and make my 
changes. If it's useful I issue a pull request that the core team sees. 
They can easily see a diff on that and decide if it's good code (we're 
not all like Otto and write it perfect first :).

In larger Open Source projects (I talk with the Datamapper lead 
regularly) people often make a few commits then bundle it all into one 
before the pull request. This does put responsibility on the person 
doing the pull request. In Datamapper the lead doesn't even look at a 
patch without documentation and an explanation of the change. Yes he 
might miss a patch but we only have so much time.

My general project workflow (WP site dev) is to start a git branch 
'development' and work in that. As a portion of work is done I merge it 
into my local master and then deploy (if it's just me) or issue a pull 
request. If I'm working on a larger item (like modding wp-cycle 
recently) I'll name the branch after the feature then merge to 
development then master.

Git is also way faster. Though I've never used anything else I sat with 
a programmer last night who was saying 'Wow' every few seconds at the 
speed of Git. He's been a CVS, SVN guy for years.

The best article I read on Git was:
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

After reading that it really started to make sense.

Not sure if that specifically answers any questions but if someone is 
interested I could put you in touch with the project lead from 
Datamapper. I've known him for years and doubt he'll mind talking about 
their process on Github and why he chooses it. He's a seriously smart 
dude (scouted by Twitter last year) with lots of experience.

If anyone wants to ask more question on or off list feel free.

Some of the smartest developers I know locally are huge fans of Git, though I have yet to use it.  I have all kind of issues with Subversion though so I can easily assume that given my issues with SVN and so many other smart people advocating for Git that it must be a better way.

That said, I've heard about Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and maybe one other on this thread.  So the question I think might be not "Should we switch from SVN" but instead "Which solution should we TO?"  If others feel it's appropriate for the list I'd really love to hear discussions about the pros and cons of the various alternatives especially as it relates to WordPress core and to plugins.

I think Git is a better way but I understand that not everyone will. For 
some the issue is that they already know SVN (I already know Git so I'm 
totally in favour of that).

I think the real question for WP is, would going to another system 
increase the participation long term? I'd anticipate that no matter what 
change happened there would be some drop in participation as people 
would decide it's not worth it. But in a year would we have more people 
committing b/c of a transition to X.

I personally don't think switching to git, hg, bzr, tla will change the
level of contribution. WP has done very well with an "antiquated, old,
slow" subversion.

The core team has been cranking out high quality releases fairly well.
I'm not sure if all the core developers are on this list, and even if
they are, if they don't have any issues, then there's no need to ask
them to switch.

The switch is not going to be something as simple as using svn-git, it's
not a "just type git, instead of svn" change. it's a change in the
workflow.. I still believe if we are to do it, we should start small,
perhaps with the theme, or akismet, or some plugin..

the core team needs to make the decision to switch to Git, Hg, etc..
they shouldn't make the switch because someone who may or may not
contribute as much (no offense intended to anyone).. we need to work
with the core team, not the other way around..

Just my $0.02 adjusted for todays inflation.

That's really helpful.  I tell ya, I wish there were some Git+WordPress guru cause I'd love to sit down for an hour to learn the workflow. It's just something I struggle with to get working on my own just by reading articles (not sure why.)

How native is git on people's machines? I know SVN is packaged with OS  
X (I don't know about Windows), but I don't believe Git is. I could  
definitely see a more complex setup process deterring people from  
submitting plugins, for example ? I know I was pretty confused when I  
wanted to submit my first plugin a few years back.

Git has an installer on google code. 4 lines to tell git who you are and 
it's setup. It's in apt for Linux and Mysysgit is the Windows version. 
I've used them all and it was pretty easy.

I use Git 90% from the command line. If you're looking for GUI then 
Tower is the best for OS X and Git does come bundled with a GUI.

The owner of the fruit stand in Cupertino is known to take things out at

I'm fairly certain there are quite a few just on this mailing list. :)

One thing I think would be really nice about using Git is that we keep
the history for the patches themselves. For example, if I were to work
on my Google Code-In task (switching the AtomPub API and Blogger
Importer to SimplePie), you could see all the mistakes and corner cases
I dealt with on the way. Being able to see the history of things and
*why* stuff was changed is one of the big advantages of version control
systems.

I agree that for smaller patches, Git isn't necessary, but it would
certainly help for larger patches. I'd still love to see WP switch to
Git, and I've got plenty more reasons why, but this discussion isn't
going to change anything.

This all said, you can (sort of) use Git for WP development already.
Fork one of the Git mirrors and do your stuff, then use a tool like `git
svn-diff` [0] to convert it into a patch for submission to Trac. It's a
bit hackish, but it does the job.

I'd avoid that though. I find most pluggable functions rather lame. Unless
you're trying to replace the entire authentication system with something
else, there's generally a great way to modify a lot of the pluggable
functions via actions and filters.

Instead, use the phpmailer action to simply modify the entire object as you
wish. You can easily trigger SMTP that way.

To actually modify the content, there's another filter that allows that
(though the phpmailer action would work too), in wp_mail() I think. But a
lot of the registration/notification emails are also pluggable. Overriding
those are also rather sane, as all there is, is the text and a call to
wp_mail() in most cases.

WordPress and future decisions aside, it really isn't surprising at all 
that you don't fully grok GIT.

I've only recently tried GIT with any intention of actual use, but it 
was like a glass of water in a desert. I started out in a completely 
different version control system and found that SVN had all of the 
fundamentals but all the advanced features were only there as stubs. 
  The fact that SVN is soooo popular is actually really sad because 
people who haven't been exposed to a full implementation are taught that 
all of the most powerful features of version control are kind of 
pointless. I would suspect that svn never had time to mature to the 
point of replacing the feature stubs before it became wildly popular and 
now it can't due to backwards compatibility concerns.  But who knows, 
maybe it was done deliberately.

For about a decade I used a version control system called StarTeam 
(owned by Starbase at the time, now Borland).  When I started with SVN, 
I was horrified to find that creating a tag was functionally equivalent 
to creating a branch!  In most every VCS a tag/label is just a pointer 
record saying "Version #.#.# consists of the check ins at this point in 
time or at this revision number." But look at what the tags of 3.0.0, 
3.0.1, 3.0.2 and 3.0.3 have done - they have produced four full 
additional sets of the entire code base because a dozen or two files 
changed.  Remember also that those tags are on top of the full copy of 
the code ala the 3.0 branch (which was a full copy of the trunk).  Why 
do we need 5 full copies of 3.0 taking up disk space because maybe two 
  dozen files changed. Compare that to a four extra database record 
consisting of a string label and a revision number, and the difference 
is obvious - the only copy of the code is the 3.0 branch itself (which 
could consist solely of a pointer to specific revision of the trunk).

Yes, it is all functional, but crudely so.  It only gets really horrible 
when you start looking same redundancy in the plugin repository.  An 
extra copy exists of every single release of every single plugin out 
there.  Doing a full check out of the plugin repository is horribly 
difficult and time consuming. On disk it probably takes of dozens of 
times more space than needed - if not more.

The merging of branches is equally rudimentary. The single time I tried 
to do it in SVN, what should have been an hour long process took most of 
a day.

IMHO SVN is great brute force tool and as a mockup of version control, 
it's fairly complete.  The fact that an open source solution existed at 
all 6 years ago was great. Kudos to CVS and SVN. The alternatives most 
all cost serious money.  However, faced with the same decision today, 
with all of the SVN replacements we have available, I doubt we'd choose SVN.

10 years. SVN was created in 2000.

Also, you're talking to somebody who has used a lot of revision
control systems. I used Visual SourceSafe in 2000 when working on
Windows stuff, CVS in college, SVN since then, RCS as recently as 4
years ago (seriously), BitKeeper (shoot me), something new that I
can't remember the name of last year (it was bad enough that I blocked
it out), and I even once worked on a system that still had SCCS on it.

My mental block is pretty much exclusive to *distributed* revision
control systems. Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. See, without the concept of a
central point for the code, the whole thing doesn't make any sense to
me. You check stuff out, you check stuff in, you merge... that's the
whole point of revision control.

See, having a local repository doesn't make any sense. I've never
needed to roll-back my own changes locally. I just undo the changes
myself. Or fix the problem. Why would you ever check in non-working
code? You test the thing *before* you check it in (when possible). I
don't check in code as I work on it. I work on it until it's working,
then I check it in.

A lot of WordPress treats the checked in code as "production" code.
It's finished. Ready to run. All of WordPress core is pretty much
runnable code, except for the occasional mistakes. WordPress.org
itself runs on trunk, whenever anybody gets around to deploying new
code to it. The core WordPress.com code is updated tens of times a
day. I myself run the WordPress trunk on my own sites, updated daily.
To me, that's the whole point: the checked in code is finished code,
for the most part. I don't check in unfinished code.

So I don't really get why you'd want a local repo. I don't get why
you'd want to merge your local repo with a "central" repo. I don't get
why you'd want to have to do all this frickin' merging from the
central back to your local all the bloody time. And branching is a
pain in the ass regardless of what type of system you use, so why
would you want to do it more? That sort of thing. I need something
that explains why this stuff is better your way. Because to me, it
sounds far more difficult. In order to make a change, I have to
download an entire frickin' repo and then create a branch? F- that,
bro. That's really enough to keep me from even trying. That's why I
avoid github, because it makes everything complicated. Give me the
code, let me change it, let me send you the patch. That's easy. That
way I'm dealing one-on-one with some person. Trying to figure out your
wacky-ass system is a pain in the ass.

Just saying. :)

<snip>

I'll throw some extra pointers in the discussion: Google uses git to
manage the Android project, after open sourcing a new release. The web
interface they use for code submission and review (named gerrit[1]) is
really good, and could be used for code review in wordpress.com.

There's also a git UI for windows called tortoise-git[2]; I've been
using it for a little while ago and can't say much about it. It relies
on mingw and msysgit[3], and is reported to be a bit slower than git
on posix systems, but still faster than SVN.

[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/, https://review.source.android.com
[2] http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/
[3] http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/

That's my pro-git opinion. On the other hand, it seems to me, from
what I read about Automattic, that the pushes to production on
wordpress.com are made through SVN. If that's the case, they would
have to make changes to their automation scripts, and this may put
wordpress.com at risk of being out of service for some time, if the
scripts are not rewritten correctly. That's my
pro-don't-change-what's-working statement. If you ask me, I wouldn't
change what's working unless it stops working and git could make a
better solution for the problem.

Hopefully, this will help.

Best,

Otto, I think the only way you'll get it is by actually trying it out.

Maybe start with Mercurial first, since it's command line interface is more
similar to svn and has a very nice tutorial (already mentioned in this
thread):

http://hginit.com/

Make sure to start at "Subversion Re-education" ;)

Already read that. Short version: He's wrong and I disagree with the
very first page of his argument. :)

Specifically, this:
"Every time you reach a logical point where your code is a little bit
better, you can commit it."

What? WHY?

Why would you need to check in unfinished code, ever? Put simply, that
doesn't make a lick of sense. And he doesn't bother to explain it
either. He does go on to point out the differences between merging a
set of several changes and merging two big lumps, but again, he never
bothers to explain why you'd ever check in gradually in the first
place. Am I supposed to stop every 10 lines and check in the code or
something? That doesn't make any sense at all.

When I write code, I sit down and start writing. As I write, I test
when appropriate. When I'm done writing and the code works, I stop.
There is no natural point anywhere in that process for me to check in
code. I don't check in half-written code. I don't write parts of code.
I know what I'm going to code before I ever write the first line.

Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm weird. I'll accept that. But I check in when
I'm done. And I'm done before I stop.

Yes, this works for smaller projects.  Quick patches, adding filters, etc.
 But if you're working on a larger project and will need to step away at any
point in time, it might be too large to keep your entire thought process in
hand at once.  For example, the reason why I pitched an idea for ticket
15066 but haven't written a patch yet is the size of the project.  Yes, a
new class will be a separate file, but as I build it I'll want to keep track
of the changes I make.

For some of us, it's easy to work on large projects by breaking them into
smaller, "micro" projects.  When each micro project is complete, I commit to
my local repository (Git, Hg, whatever I happen to be using).  The entire
project isn't done yet, so I don't want to share it with anyone else, but
the micro project I've been working on *is* done and I want to mark that
milestone in case I need to come back to it later.

So for small patches (the majority of *current* WordPress work), it wouldn't
make sense to move to a different version control system.  SVN works just
fine for that.  But when working on larger projects, it makes sense to use a
local repository to break up the work and push the entire changeset when the
project is complete.

Once again, though, core committers already kind of do this with trunk.  But
for those of us without commit rights, we can't publish partially-completed
patches to trunk.  We can't revert those partial changes when we realize
we've made a mistake.  All we can do is write code, create a patch file, and
manually upload it to Trac.  From that perspective, SVN is a major PITA.

see the step inbetween? you test stuff. thats where its useful to check in
stuff.

if i have to perform steps a, b, c, d, e, f to get feature 1 to work, i
might be able to get away with writing a, b, c and test it. i want to test
it because i dont want to move on unless im getting what i expect out of it.
if i test it and i get what i expect, i'd rather check that in right then.
d, e, and f might get worked on the next day or immediately after, but it
wouldn't matter. tomorrow if im offline and i have 20 mins i might get d
done and tested, ill commit that. this i couldnt do with svn. then when i
return to my wifi connection at the office ill finish up e and f, test them.
if all goes well by the end of that day ill send a pull request.

the alternative is to beleive that ur a, b, and c worked when you tested
them but if u ever think change some of the code in those parts to make d,
e, and f work, and consequentially it breaks those first set of tests, you
don't know how to get back to a point where a, b, and c at least passed ur
tests.

check in half-written code. I don't write parts of  code. I know what I'm
going to code before I ever write the first line.

I do the same thing.  But as I've said in previous messages I break up
larger projects into smaller ones.  For example:

When adding the new XMLRPC hooks for post formats, I worked on one XMLRPC
method at a time:

   1. First I coded for metaWeblog.editPost.  Once I finished that, I tested
   and made sure it worked.  If I were using Hg or Git, I would have committed
   then ...
   2. Next I worked on metaWeblog.newPost (which was very similar).  After I
   finished I tested and made sure it worked.  (I would have committed here).
   3. Then I worked on metaWeblog.getPosts and metaWeblog.getRecentPosts at
   the same time because they were both small.  Tested and made sure they
   worked.  (I would have committed here).
   4. Finally I added the wp.getPostFormats method, tested and got it
   working.  With everything working for that one ticket, I would have
   committed here, then pushed the entire project.

With the SVN system, though, I created a patch of the entire project and
uploaded it to Trac.  Yes, this worked, but this is a small example.  For
anything significantly larger, it would be much easier to commit in stages,
as the smaller parts of the project are finished, then push when I'm done
with the entire ticket.

Okay, so you want a local repository for your own use. I get that. Makes sense.

But why do you want to inflict all your changesets on everybody else?
Why not just send the final product to the root when you're done? See,
that's my confusion here. In the examples on hginit.com, he shows how
the local changes can be pushed to the central hub as a whole, showing
all those local changes in the central after the push. That I don't
understand. Why should anybody care about your local changesets? Until
you push to the root, nobody else has to care about what you're
working on. And when you do push, only the final product is important.

And yes, Curtis pointed out earlier that this is optional with git and
you can make it only show the overall change. But how is that
different than now? You make all your changes using whatever local
repo system floats your boat, then create a patch against trunk and
send the patch. If good, patch is committed. If not, it's not, or you
change until it is.

The merging process weirds me out too. With the distributed method,
the person doing the push has to do the merge with everybody else's
push. But that's the same anyway, because in order for a commit to
happen, the patch must be refreshed and merged with the latest trunk.
There just isn't enough difference here for me to see any value.

Committed where? To your local repo? Who cares? You do, obviously, but
committing locally is basically wanking, as far as I can see. A local
commit is pointless unless you do actually need to revert to it at
some point in time.

And yes, that may help your development process. Everybody develops
differently, and I fully get that. But that doesn't change anything
with regards to the overall project. When you actually do send your
changes back out to everybody else (commit to the central point),
you're still committing all at once.

Why can't you just run your own local repo in any way you choose,
using any software you choose? Hell, run git locally, commit to your
hearts content. Then, when you're done and have something worthy of
the main core, submit a diff like everybody else does.

I'm trying to understand the benefits, really, but I'm just not seeing
it. You seem to be making some kind of assumption that anybody is
allowed to commit to the central point, which makes no sense. A select
group controls the central point. And you're not going to successfully
argue away from that. Even in small teams and closed projects, the
central repository is tightly controlled. It takes effort to get past
the gatekeepers, and that effort doesn't go away, ever.

Not trying to argue away from the core committer system.  I highly support
that model because it keeps a lot of needless junk out of the repository.
 I'm just trying to explain hpw and why *I* use distributed version control
systems (in response to your original statement that you didn't understand
why people would want to).

The only reason I would ever want WordPress to move to a Git/Hg/Whatever
system would be to make it easier on developers.  As is, I *do* use my own
version control system, export to a diff when I'm finished with my work, and
upload the patch to Trac.  But that's a lot of extra work to set up, not a
clean development cycle, and makes it very difficult to distribute my
changes.  Pulling diffs down from Trac and patching my working copy so I can
test new features before their committed is also a very convoluted and
frustrating system (and the #1 reason new developers give me for *not* working
on WordPress).

A Git base system would allow us to retain a similar system to the one we
have now - lots of developers can work on WordPress and submit changes but
only a select few can commit to the central repository.  When a developer
who's not a core contributor has a patch to submit, s/he pushes the
changeset to a public location (not to trunk, but to a branch of the
repository marked specifically for a ticket) and anyone else can clone from
that branch.

It makes testing a patch as simple as right-clicking in a GUI ...

If the patch is good and the core committers decide to make it core, they
merge it into trunk.  If not, they can provide feedback and the dev can keep
working (or another dev can pitch in).  Or they could close the branch all
together.

Why should anybody care about your local changesets? Until
you push to the root, nobody else has to care about what you're
working on. And when you do push, only the final product is important.

you're right.

But how is that
different than now? You make all your changes using whatever local
repo system floats your boat, then create a patch against trunk and
send the patch. If good, patch is committed. If not, it's not, or you
change until it is.

its diff because for the individual, merging the changes that occurred in
trunk because fast and easy, and the right person for the job is doing it
(namely the person who knows where their code has impact and where it
doesnt). this directly impacts how many 'not so good' patches the maintainer
should see. the truth is that if distributed isn't your style, your workflow
doesnt change at all. the flexibility for others is nice though.

The merging process weirds me out too. With the distributed method,
the person doing the push has to do the merge with everybody else's
push.

not exactly, thats a lot of what your used to with central vc speaking.
basically your job as a maintainer becomes the following: pull request comes
in, you look through the code and see if it verifies fine. it does great,
merge. another pull request comes in, it looks like it works great with what
they have, so merge. but wait it doesn't play nice with what the person who
i just merged with just gave me, okay i'm not going to waste any time on
solving this, he wrote the code so he can do it ant then ill look at it
again. and then u keep going..." merging just becomes a simple job that can
happen almost daily. like checking your email. you get involved at some
major milestones to do more thorough testing. you'll probably make the
community more active by having regular updates.

it roxx for testing also. unless someone mentioned it already, I can fork
the main and push my tests to my repo. people from all over can test what I
made directly and the guys incharge of the main repo can merge my branch
anytime. yay!!

Hmm.. Sorry, but it sounds complicated to me. Basically, you're saying
that I have to somehow hook my repo to yours just to test a patch.
Which means that I have to know some kind of obscure features of a
version control system to somehow hook my copy of the repo into yours
(or your branch), then do some kind of update to get your changes and
test them.

As opposed to the dirt simple process of applying a patch file.

Huh? I right click the diff file and select "Apply Patch". How hard is
it to apply a patch for you?

So the merge load is put onto the maintainers then? I'd really rather
have the merge burden be on those submitting the patch in the first
place, where it is now.

Err... You do an svn up and then correct the conflicts. When you're
done with the merge (refreshed patch), you submit the diff. The burden
of the merge is on the person creating the patch, where it should be.
Maintainers shouldn't be tasked with any merging at all.

also for somewhat larger changes, if a team of people want to work on it
together before someone higher up looks at it and gives it time of day, all
that is soo much easier with distributed. right now i think a larger change
would just be shunned because its too much effort to merge properly.

basically it helps the individual by making their code more current (by
making merges easier) and the maintainer by spending less time on patches
that need to be revised (aka bad).

Wait, how exactly are merges easier?

A conflict is a conflict. It must be resolved before it can be applied
to the central point. Having a distributed version control system
doesn't make merges magically happen properly. If two people change
the same code, then it's going to cause conflicts, period.

That's where your SVN mentality comes in, where merges are hard.

No, as previously mentioned by someone else, a merge that doesn't work out
of the box would simply be marked as needs-refresh.

It's easier when you move code from one file to another, for example,
because git keeps track of that.

I had that problem when working on my GSoC project, which involved a lot of
moving code around.

No. Merges are hard because *merges are hard*.

If two people change the same line, then somebody has to fix the line.
Simple as that. A version control system can't fix that. This is code,
not magic.

Even SVN can merge two different changesets that don't touch the same
lines (but do touch the same files). I use this all the time. It works
fine.

Sooo... how is this different then?

I admit that that is a great improvement over SVN's purely single file
based system. However, it seems like a fairly thin and uncommon case
to me. Furthermore, this is basically an incremental improvement that
is not based on the distributed nature of the version control system.

How does making the version control *distributed* improve the ability to merge?

Not as complicated as that.  When I write a patch, I submit a pull request
to the central server.  Then, anyone can look at the central server and see
my branch (*not* trunk) and can switch from where they're at to my branch to
test my changes.  Other developers can then make further changes to what
I've done and commit them to my branch as well.  If you want an actual diff,
you just diff between my branch and the head of trunk.  In this situation,
you'd have one diff/patch for a ticket ... some tickets currently have
several and no real way to distinguish which are incremental changes and
which are replacements for other features.

I had to wait until post formats were formally committed, for example,
because I couldn't figure out which of the 6 patches actually made up the
feature.  Some changed the same code, some changed other code, some was
proof of concept and later in the Trac discussion rejected for a better
piece of code.

>So the merge load is put onto the maintainers then? I'd really rather have
the merge burden be on those submitting the patch in the first place, where
it is now.

Merging a branch is no different than applying a patch.  Currently, the
"merge burden" is on the maintainers.  We write code, produce a diff and
upload it to Trac.  You download the diff, apply the patch and commit.  With
a distributed system, we write code and submit a pull request (our local
repository notifies you that there are changes ready to go and exactly what
those changes are).  You pull our branch and merge it into trunk.

Merge = Apply patch

> How hard is it to apply a patch for you?

Truth be told, I've been working with WordPress for 3 years now and have
never successfully applied a patch to my own working copy.  It usually turns
out that the diff file on Trac is a version or 20 behind my working copy and
SVN doesn't know how to reconcile that problem.  If I wrote the patch, I can
always svn up and create a new diff ... but patching an existing diff back
to my working copy has proven all but impossible.

> No. Merges are hard because *merges are hard*.

I'm going to agree with Scribu here.  I used to think merges were hard
because *merges are hard* ... until I switched to a different system.

Mercurial, for example, merges entirely differently than SVN.  SVN looks at
the current state of two files and attempts to infer the differences between
them to combine the files.  Conflicts occur frequently and can be a pain to
reconcile.

Mercurial works its way backwards from each changeset to the common ancestor
of both branches.  By moving through every change, it can build a much
fuller picture of how each files has changed - even if two developers change
the same line of code!  It's not magic, and you'll still run into the
occasional conflict, but they're not anywhere near as common as with SVN.

Otto:
SVN has always stunk at merging, and the Collab.net guys (and now Apache Foundation, I suppose) will readily admit that. It is a difficult matter. 


The problem is that you're still coming at this from an RCS/CVS/SVN "repo is king" mindset. I'm on my mobile, so I'll let the following link describe exactly what I mean:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43995/why-is-branching-and-merging-easier-in-mercurial-than-in-subversion

It's a mindjack at first, especially if you're used to an orderly hierarchy for changes, but once you glom onto the distributed mindset, it's really a game-changer.

So in other words, there's no way for me to get *only* your changes. I
have to get your changes plus lose changes from everybody else
(including trunk) that you have yet to merge with.

How can I test two different "branches" together, at the same time?
Because right now, all I really have to do is to apply both sets of
patches to my working copy. If they don't work, I revert.

True that, but that is mainly because different people are submitting
different ideas and not all working on one set of code. An analogous
situation would be if each person made their own "branch" and worked
on it independently. Enabling developers to work from each others
branches is good, but it doesn't magically solve the problem since
different people have different ideas and means of implementation.
Honestly, your way sounds like more work, since you just get people
arguing over what should be in a branch while trunk goes further and
further away.

I don't see how, unless they take it upon themselves to refresh the
patch. Which, admittedly, does happen sometimes, but usually only for
smaller patches. The thing I like about patches is that *I can read
them directly*. I don't need to merge them to know what they'll do,
most of the time. The patch itself contains, in a minimal set of code,
pretty much the explanation of what it does and how it works. I
generally know what it'll do without merging it and without trying it.
I can spot code errors in it without testing. A diff is more than
capable of standing alone.

Weird. I've never seen a patch that didn't merge, or that wasn't
easily resolved. You just look at the conflict file and fix the
conflicting lines.

i write better code if i can experiment more.
i experiment more if its easy to branch
i branch if its easy to merge
its easier to merge in a distributed system because of the features it has
(rebasing, submodules, tracking changes across files, "smarter" diff-ing
through ancestry, n-way merges)

if i write better code, you (as a maintainer) get less crappy stuff to deal
with, more time for beer.

easier than that. u run one command to merge. "$ git merge scott/master
rick/master tom/master" it tracks all of the ancestry so you dont have to
look at a diff or a patch or anything. just run that and test. it's more
likely to work since it has more history to look at, and if it doesn't, you
tell them to update and send it to you again.

Actually the 6 years was rough guess at when the WordPress repositories 
came into being and were converted into SVN.  I remember when I first 
started using WordPress I'd grabbed the code using CVS and had even 
created my own repository for all the core hacks I did.. Ahhh the good 
old days..  That was like WP 1.2 and then it went to SVN not too 
terribly long after that. That had to have been 2004-2005ish right?

It all depends upon the paradigm.  It seems strange to me too, but I can 
definitely see advantages, especially in a corporate environment with 
many hands at various skill levels are in the mix.  The real issue I see 
is that you really don't use the repository iteratively. The WordPress 
repository functions almost primarily as a distribution tool, and is 
VERY unsuited for mid-development check ins.

Yet, surely you've had time where you've wanted to try an approach you 
know may be the way you want to go in the end?  Checking in before going 
down that path means that you have an easy way to go back to your 
original code. Having a local only check in means that it affects no-one 
else.   With your methodology, you would probably create a local copy 
outside of the repository.  Two different approaches, but one more 
easily allows the commented revisions to stay around longer and perhaps 
be revived at a later point.

Another added benefit is that, as you can check in each file in your 
batch of changes, you can take the time to comment what was done in 
each. Then after the all are in and the code as a whole is in a working 
state, you push to the hub.  That means there's no unlucky circumstances 
where someone does a check out while you only have half of your files in.

Exactly. And with a local repository the only difference is that you 
have an option to safely use the repository iteratively and you'd have 
to change your wording to "I don't push unfinished code."

LOL  That sounds so complicated and painful.  The only thing different 
for you is that you would do a push with each commit.  Heck, you'd 
probably even setup an automatic push on the post-commit hook so that 
you'd not have to ever even think about the _____ _____ ___ pushes again. :P

Because there's pain and then there is 
rolling-around-in-a-pile-of-razorblades-soaking-in-lemon-juice 
(Pronounced: merging branches via svn).  Merging branches may be tedious 
if you don't keep up to date with the changes in the trunk, but it 
doesn't have to be excruciating.

I always like reading your posts :D

Then don't create a branch. That does seem silly!  You don't have to 
formalize your local check out as a branch.  In a practical sense, you 
can use git exactly like you use SVN.  From my experience, other than 
the three letters, the only /required/ difference is a push after the 
commits.

True, and I'll totally grant you that. I do not see the point of
iterative check-ins at all. Maybe it helps some people. I can't argue
that. I still can't see a use for it, but that's just me.

In all the corporate environments I've used where a group had "commit"
access to a central repository, checking something out actually locked
it, and it stayed locked by that person until they released the lock
by checking in their changes. Sometimes it's a pain to work with, but
generally speaking you make your changes then have to do a merge later
when you have the ability to check it out. If you need it now, you go
talk to that person and coordinate. This can be a pain in the ass
sometimes, but it certainly does ensure code integrity. Most of the
time it was not a problem. You made your changes, then checked out and
merged before checking in. So files were only locked while somebody
was actually in the process of merging code.

On the other hand, in these cases, the code in the repository was the
"staging" code (when it wasn't the "production" code). It was running
live somewhere. So what you checked in had to work (or at least, not
crash). This has been the case everywhere. If you checked in broken
code, you brought down a system somewhere.

I've never seen any other way of using a code repository in a
corporate environment.

As somebody who doesn't use an IDE, my process for creating a patch
against core is pretty simple. I use Windows most of the time, and
Tortoise SVN.

First, I update my working copy to trunk. This is not unusual, I run
trunk live, so I do that all the time. Right click the WP folder,
select SVN Update.

Second, I make my changes. Usual editor on Windows: TextPad.

Third, I test my changes. Since I have my trunk running live on a
local install, this is easy. Don't even have to copy stuff around.

Fourth, I make the diff. Right click the WP folder, select SVN->Create
Patch. Save the diff file somewhere (usually the same directory the wp
install is in). I tend to give it a name based on the number of the
ticket. Don't have to, but it helps to know what's what.

Fifth, I upload the patch to the relevant ticket.

Easy, really.

If I'm working in Linux, I use the command line. svn up, svn diff, etc.

Not where I worked. Occasionally you would lock the database, but that 
was because you couldn't do merges in the core db.

Other than that, it was expected you would do multiple checkins through 
out the day/week.  For example when moving to work with someone in their 
office or in the projector room, you might check in incomplete code.   
The code on your desk was never to be more than 8 hours off from the 
repository and the projects we were given could last weeks or longer, so 
you couldn't practically check in only completed tested code.  Now, it 
was expected that the code would compile and execute at the end of the day.

As a result of this, merges happened all the time. No big deal. 
Additionally, a couple people might split off a branch if the nature of 
their project would affect the operation of the system too much and 
break things for an extended period, until the work was done.  At that 
point we'd merge the branches and almost always it was relatively 
painless. Usually, it was done without any direct intervention as the 
branches were expected to each keep up with the core code.  If there 
were conflicts, with three way differences they were pretty easily resolved.

Why not just bundle the phpmailer class (or a similar lib) with your plugin? Won't that take care of all of the above? 87k and you Bob's your uncle.

unchanged

Fourth, I make the diff. Right click the WP folder, select SVN->Create

[svn add --force * (worse case)]  --> git commit -a

Fifth, I upload the patch to the relevant ticket.


unchanged.

--------

my point is if your workflow is nearly unchanged if thats the way you want
to work. but if your willing to make these small adjustments you open the
door for others to work in some different (and i'd say likely to yield some
better results) ways.

better support for collaboration (nobody would have to think about how to
configure a repo to share amongst those they want to work with, it would be
a given by adopting the git system), better support for locally tracking
changes (so that you encourage understanding your development path and the
history of your mistakes/revisions), experimentation (low cost support to
try out some wilder things that have been a pain thus far because of the
hassle of a large merge).

* oh and you'll probably use less room on ur hard drive if all you're
interested in is trunk / master :)

Thanks for the details.  Still, that works for you but is a PITA for me. 

I typically am working on a project, which cannot be based on trunk when discover something I'd like to offer a patch for in core. If I am not pressed for an immediate deadline I could modify core in my current project as a proof of concept and if it works I'd like to be able make a patch for core from there (and then issue a rollback since I can't deliver code to clients that depend on a patched core.)  But I can't do it this way.

Instead I have to do the above and then go to another directory to pull down trunk. I have to recreate the data environment including what relevant plugins are currently installed needed for testing this issue in trunk (which sadly my development project's database already has.) That can take from 5 minutes or more than an hour, depending. Now I have to go find all my changes and reapply them to trunk. That can take 5 minutes, or longer than an hour, depending.  After finally getting the idea implemented in the latest version of trunk only then can I make the patch. But since I don't work in trunk like you usually do, this is typically something that I can't devote the time to because its unknown to me how long it will take and my subsequent client deadline pressures.

I could start from trunk when I try my core but I'd still have to redevelop the data environment and either way it just makes it too much effort most of the time.

I'm not sure, but it sounds like Git/Mecurial/Bazaar/etc. would make it easier for me to provide patches of the core directly from my client projects instead of having to set up a trunk. If so it would be a huge win to enable me to contribute more patches to core.

WordPress already includes, and leverages, the phpmailer library.

You already have full control over the function, as it is pluggable. But
even then, there's an action that passes the entire phpmailer object by
reference, thus you can already do anything you want. I've explained this in
greater detail in another email of this thread.

Git works the same way, and you can configure your merging tool (p4merge
is nice) to show the common root of the two.

The point is though, both Mercurial and Git spawned from Linux, where
branches are very common and merging is done often, so they're both
designed specifically to merge well. SVN was not (AFAIK).

Ironically, one thing Git really doesn't have is a nice merging tool for
conflicts, and the Git developers are aware of that. I use p4merge
personally, as I find it to be pretty useful, but I think TortoiseGit
probably includes the standard TortoiseMerge tool. Command line git is
horrible for it though (unless you like vimdiff).

Applying a patch in SVN:

    patch -p0 < some.diff

Merging someone else's code in with Git:

    git pull <repo url or name> <branch name, usually master>

Undoing that patch in SVN:

    svn -R revert *

Undoing the merge in Git:

    git reset --hard HEAD

Committing the patch in SVN:

    svn commit -m 'Some message, props xyz'

Committing* the patch in Git:

    git push


* Note: this isn't actually committing, as pulling someone else's repo
in will merge their commits.

Actually, `git format-patch` would do the same anyway.

Although, it doesn't leverage a lot of its functionality, nor easily
expose it. For example, it's not possible to send a HTML email using
wp_mail() (unless you do all sorts of trickery using the filters in it),
despite how easy PHPMailer makes this. (#15448)

I think you're missing the point. I almost never actually apply other
people's patches. I don't have to. I simply read them. You know, with
my eyes.

If you give me a URL or whatever link to your branch, how do I see it?
How can I see what your code changes are?

I only run code when I want to test it or deploy it. When I'm
collaborating, I'm not running other people's code, I'm reading it and
giving them feedback. Sometimes, if I'm going to change it, then I
apply it and make the changes. But that's rare.

Also, keep in mind that I am not a core committer. I'm not pushing
changes into core. I submit my changes to trac like everybody else.

So, basically you're saying that I need some tool to create a diff so
I can read it?

Gitorious looks sorta like a trac-like system, but for git. Right? Is
it a service like github, or is it a piece of software I can run
myself on my own site?

Is there software we can run to do this sort of thing? Because hosting
it elsewhere is a poor choice, IMO. Another reason I dislike github
(and Google code, for that matter).

I do the same, and you can use the same workflow of patches if you'd
prefer. If you'd prefer not to use patches, and use Git's, the web
interfaces work extremely well for this.

Take, for example, the changes I've been making to reddit's iPhone
application. This works well as an example, since it's the same workflow
as (I expect) people would use with WP. I forked their repository, and
have been working on it on my own repository. You can check my changes
at any time through something like:

https://github.com/rmccue/iReddit/compare/master

GitHub also makes merging this easy, with pull requests. Take for
example, this one:

https://github.com/reddit/iReddit/pull/1

You can see the discussion (not unlike a Trac ticket), the commits, and
you can get a diff view on the Files Changed tab.

I'm not saying that we necessarily need to use GitHub (in fact, running
our own would probably be better), but their interface is fantastic.

I'm aware of this, but my point was that merging in code from others is
not necessarily any harder than SVN. Specifically, refuting "As opposed
to the dirt simple process of *applying* a patch file." (Emphasis mine)

Okay, but is that a function of git or a function of github?

I guess my confusion here stems from the fact that you seem to be
mixing up a lot of things that should be separate. Trac is not SVN,
for example. And while yes, given a couple of URLs I can use a command
line of SVN to make a diff of two separate repositories and such, it's
not something I would want to do often. Basically, it sounds like a
pain in the ass.

(Note, not talking WP process here now, just general thoughts)

When somebody sends me changes, I expect them to send me a file full
of their changes. I expect to read that file to see their changes. If
they send me a URL, then that's more burden on me. Now I have to go
and get their changes from somewhere. Now I have to go and do merges
to get their changes. Now I have to craft annoying command lines or
use online web tools just to see their changes.

Why can't they just send me their changes directly? Seems a whole hell
of a lot simpler to me than to rely on a bunch of tools and web sites
and management systems... Just send me the damn changes and let me
look at them. Then I can decide whether to merge them or not. Then I
can tell you what I think and give feedback. Making me jump through a
bunch of hoops just to even SEE your changes is ridiculous.

Yes, it's roughly trac for git, but better looking. :-)

It is both a service and a piece of open-source software, just like wp.comand
wp.org, respectively.

Also, a little googling found a native git command, namely git diff-tree.

GitHub is really just a nice UI on top of Git. That's really just doing
a `git diff reddit/master...rmccue/master`

Sure, but currently, you get patches via Trac, and you can view them
through the UI on there. GitHub (as a tool) can do that same thing, but
also give you the context of the commits.

If someone had just a Git repository, you could do it through the git
command line itself, or a multitude of other ways.

The majority of patches for WordPress come via Trac, and I'd assume
that's where most people would get the patches from. If you're already
using that web interface, why not integrate it into your web interface?

I'd love to answer any other questions, and discuss this further with
you, but I feel we're probably getting a bit off topic here. Feel free
to email me off-list if you'd like to discuss this further.

Though it could also be `git diff master...other/master` (three
periods)  depending on what you want to do.

Thinking about this some more here...

My point is that developers tend to be very good at managing files.
Now you're asking them to manage URLs instead, and that seems more
difficult. You need tools to do it. You need web based systems to
collaborate with, which understand those URLs and systems. And yes,
they are creatable and such, but that's fragile. You spend a lot of
time screwing around with the system and not enough time doing the
actual work. Sites like github and so forth bother me because they
suffer from yet-another-damn-collaboration-tool to learn.

My preferred way of accepting patches for plugins (to pick an example)
is via email. It's easy, everybody knows how to use it, etc. If I used
a repository system for it then I'd spend more time screwing around
with that than I did coding.

Don't get me wrong; I don't like SVN. Hell, I don't much care for
version control at all. It mostly gets in my way. I accept that
version control is necessary for large multi-developer projects, but I
see it as a necessary evil. So all this screwing around with various
versioning systems and ticket management tools and such generally
ticks me off because it's yet one more stupid system I have to figure
out.

And that's why I don't like git. It's yet another annoying version
system, and this time it's not only difficult to learn, but it
actively interferes with the development process by insisting that you
use it to make actual meaningful changes, by becoming part of the
management structure. Yuck.

Anyway, good discussion guys. Bedtime. :)

That is still possible with git. I'm pretty sure a patch generated with `git
diff` can still be applied using the `patch` command.

One last email before I butt out, like I should have a long time ago:

Linus agrees, hence why the tool to make patches (`git format-patch`)
makes an email file, and the tool to apply patches (`git am`) applies
from .mbox format. Personally, I think using patches with git works
perfectly fine if you want to use it that way.

I think you will find svn is much better at merging than just looking at the two files.

It can quite happily merge changesets between branches and even different repositoies

Yes conflicts occur but for the same reason they occur in other VCS's - people change the same lines of code.

I have to recreate the data environment including what relevant plugins are currently installed needed for testing this issue in trunk (which sadly my development project's database already has.) That can take from 5 minutes or more than an hour, depending. Now I have to go find all my changes and reapply them to trunk. That can take 5 minutes, or longer than an hour, depending.  After finally getting the idea implemented in the latest version of trunk only then can I make the patch. But since I don't work in trunk like you usually do, this is typically something that I can't devote the time to because its unknown to me how long it will take and my subsequent client deadline pressures.

How is switching VCS going to magically make it easier.

You still have the same base issue - you are rightly developing a site using the current stable release but want to patch against trunk.

You are still going to have to switch your code over to another checkout and test there?

In the situation you describe my process would be as follows:

1) Find bug in stable WordPress while developing client site
2) Search trac for bug reports - find nothing carry on. Find fix - apply and test out.
3) Submit trac ticket for bug
4) Create fix for bug in Stable WordPress
5) Submit patch to trac ticket against stable release.

You don't need to setup a new site or anything the checkout you have is a good place to work

In some cases your patch will apply to trunk too anyway - in other cases merging it into trunk will require some effort.

I would like to point out that a lot of developers prefer git over
Svn, some because they hear it's cool, and some because they've used
it...

I really think this discussion of what's better hypothetically needs
to be tabled until someone (Otto :)) uses git for a small project for
a month or so, thinking about git is a lot harder than using it, using
it with the guidance of someone who has an idea of what the workflow
should be, and has knowledge of commands will make the experience much
better.


Svn would be hard, if you had never used anything as well.

This is just turning into a vim vs emacs discussion...

That's really what it started as. I don't think WP will be moving to Git
soon, but probably eventually.

lol yeah this discussion is really just about preferences and opinions now.

but i think we should all agree that technically using a distributed system
like git we can do all the things we did with svn with very *few* changes.
namely the workflow can be exactly the same, some commands change in syntax.
so with that said, if others find the functionality of a distributed system
like git beneficial for some other reason, what's the problem? it doesn't
effect those that won't use those features really, and if they don't want to
use those features thats because of their preference of how they work, not
the difficulty level.

otto:
you just don't seem to value what version control is for, and thats okay.
you see it as a necessary evil when working with others on something large.
i sometimes version control something only i am independently working on
because it helps me map my changes. maybe im not as good of a programmer as
you, maybe the problems i work on need to be broken down further, or maybe i
just think differently about the problem, but i don't see why adopting
 system that lets both of us work without asking you to change very much
should be an issue with anyone. right?

I wasn't so much arguing for a switch as I was explaining why I don't produce nearly as many patches as I would like with the hopes someone could point out how to do it easier.  

And/or if those who know distributed vc well say it's possible, then my scenario would be just one data point to support it.

Then after all this time I still don't understand how patching is supposed to work.  My assumption has always been that I had to patch from trunk.  Maybe you could be so kind as to review this and make comment?

http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/990/easiest-way-to-create-a-patch-for-submission-to-wordpress-core

To be clear you are saying that if a project I'm working on is the current stable release I can generate a patch from it after modifying core and that will work for you?

Mike,
If you are working on a fix for the current release, then you need to work
against the current stable *branch*.
In the instructions here http://wordpress.org/download/svn/  (mentioned in
one of the answers to your question the checkout would be

svn co http://core.svn.wordpress.org/branches/3.0

Make sure to indicate that your patch is against the branch when you submit
it.

I'm not sure what could be any simpler than the instructions here
http://wordpress.org/download/svn/

There are  only 4 (svn) steps.

The only ones missing are 'do an svn revert and svn up' when you want to
start on the next piece of work.

So does a *branch* different from the current release?  I'm as confused by all this as Otto is confused by Git.

It's not running SVN that is complex, it's getting the right code to run SVN against that can be complex.

Yes, it does.

The current release is under tags/3.0.3.

The stable branch is in branches/3.0.

At the moment, the 3.0 branch is identical to the 3.0.3 tag, because there
haven't been any commits made yet, but that's not always the case.

A possible git workflow:

0. Clone the WP repo: git clone git://some-mirror-url.com/wordpress.git

1. Make some changes on the stable branch

2. Switch to dev branch (without loosing changes): git checkout development

3. Test changes and make patch: git format-patch > patch.diff

4. Switch back to stable branch: git checkout stable

Because you have the entire repo stored locally, switching branches is a
snap.

Of course, there are some catches, like a possible db-upgrade, which might
be harder to change back from.

So with SVN I still have the issue I described; assuming I don't want to break my project by installing not released code I still have to set up another install in order to generate a patch, right?

And so for the scenario I described Git doesn't allow me to make "patches" to the released code (vs. a branch) any more than SVN, right?

I'm with you on this.  I tried to make a patch for a bug I discovered with
Wordpress forcing verbose page rules when they weren't necessary.  Needless
to say I couldn't even get the current code checked out and gave up.  I
ended up just explaining the modification (as it was a simple one line
change) in the ticket.

Ah! Now I see your confusion.

Rule 1) You should always develop your working projects against the current
stable release (doesn't even need SVN, but it can be helpful for a long term
project -- in which case check out a *tag*).
Rule 2) You should always produce patches against a checked-out-for-patches
copy (either trunk or latest branch).
Rule 3) Never the twain shall meet.

So, yes, you need to check out copy of the latest branch if you wish to
contribute to WordPress with patches. But you can keep it around for ever,
updating regularly, and even switching it (svn switch) to another branch
when a major release comes out.

Which to check out - trunk or branch? Both is good, but are used for
different things.

If you are fixing a bug you found in the current release and want to
contribute a patch - work on the branch.

If you are proposing a new feature for the next version - work on the trunk

If you are working on a bug from trac, choose based on the 'target' for that
bug, right now target 3.0.4 == work on branch, target 3.1 == work on trunk



Hope that helps clarify the basics.

Both do and it's easy. With svn:

Presuming you already have the latest stable version of WP checked out in
the stable folder:

svn co http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/3.0.3 stable

0. Make modifications
1. Go to stable dir: cd stable
2. Make patch: svn diff > patch.diff

Thats all. You can upload patch.diff to trac.

Now, if you want to see if the patch applies to trunk, you can do this:

Presuming you already have trunk checked out in the trunk folder:

svn co http://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk

1. Go to trunk dir: cd trunk
2. Apply patch from earlier: patch -p0 < ../stable/patch.diff

If you don't understand that, I think you should take some time to really
grok SVN first:

Hi all,

Anyone know the score with the add_meta_boxes and do_meta_boxes hooks?
Looking around line 162 of edit-form-advanced.php and this ticket:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13017

seems to suggest that they do very similar things, but that
add_meta_boxes was introduced recently and that do_meta_boxes might be
deprecated (soon?). It's not clear to me.

Just wanting to know what the best hook to use is going forward.

cheers,

Steve

add_meta_boxes is for registering meta boxes to be displayed.

do_meta_boxes is for displaying those registered metaboxes.

You should use add_meta_boxes.

Thanks for the attempt.  I've got the printed copy of the book, have read it, and still don't get it.  I guess it's just a mental block for me.  I get that way for some things.

Just a quick note from someone who's been following this discussion, but
doesn't know enough to contribute to it - I'd encourage you to keep
discussions like this on-list. I've learned a lot just by reading this
discussion, and would miss out on a lot if the default were to take
discussions private as soon as they started to ramble a bit.

It's entirely possible that what I'm suggesting is either against the rules
of the list or simply not agreeable to most people, and if that is the case,
please accept my humble apology.

With Git I'd create a new branch in my client project and patch then 
issue the pull request from that branch. Then you can switch back to 
mainline and work on the stable release.

You can ignore specific client files (themes, custom plugins...) with a 
new .gitignore file in the new branch.

At this point, I think this conversation isn't going to go anywhere, but I
want to make one last comment before dropping off the thread.

When I first started working with WordPress, I had no idea what version
control was.  I wrote a plug-in and sat on it for weeks because I couldn't
figure out how to get it into the repository.  For someone new to version
control, saying "use Subversion" doesn't really describe the process ...
particularly when you have no idea what Subversion is.  All I wanted to do
was email or FTP my plug-in to the server.  That would have been easy, and
once I figured out what Subversion was I was furious.  Why use a command
line tool when I could more easily drop a ZIP file in a folder through
FileZilla?  But I slowly worked my way through it, typing in command line
statements that I didn't understand but which were laid out in the tutorial.
 Most of the time it worked ... sometimes, though, tagging a new version
broke (with a cryptic "file already exists" error) and I'd have to force a
reversion and try to commit again.  Don't believe me?  Look at the
Subversion logs for any of my plug-ins ... sometimes following the tutorial
didn't work and I was left very confused, upset, and frustrated at the
entire WordPress project.

I finally embraced Subversion during a client project.  Before then, I'd
only seen it as a distribution tool, *not* as a version control system (I
didn't understand version control beyond the concept of point releases and
named versions).  I was working on a project for a client - a custom
.NET-based CMS.  Things were going well, I was cranking out code and
everyone was happy.  One day, I was overhauling the data access layer
(sanitizing queries I'd forgotten to protect from SQL injection) and got a
phone call in the middle of the day.  It distracted me, and over the
30-minute call I forgot what I'd worked on.  I came back, looked at a
half-written line of code (literally), shrugged, and finished what I thought
I needed to finish to complete the project ...

... and I broke everything.  Somewhere I had forgotten to set a variable,
assign a type, or put a semi-colon in a query.  I looked for about 2 hours
through my 30k lines of code and couldn't find the problem ... so I just
started hitting ctrl+z in Visual Studio until I finally got back to a
version of the codebase that would build.  I had to re-produce a lot of my
work after that, and I was very burned out by the whole process.

Ever since then, I commit *everything* when I get to a logical stopping
point and can test, whether I'm done with the project or not.  When I'm on
my own repo, no one cares how many commits I have.  So for my WordPress
plug-ins, I actually have a separate repository on my local network that I
commit to.  When I get to a point where I want to package a new release, I
export the plug-in from my repository and copy the files into a folder
synced with the WordPress repo.  Then I commit and release my plug-in.

When I'm working entirely on my own, it's a good system.  But, I joined a
company about a year ago where multiple developers were working on the same
codebases at the same time ... and all hell broke loose.

I'd update my working copy, code on a project for a few hours, then try to
commit ... only to find out that a colleague had been working on the same
files that day.  I'd spend an hour or two reconciling conflicts while
merging my changes in to his.  It was a major PITA with just two of us, so
when we expanded the team to 4 people we decided to investigate other tools.

First we looked at Git because it seemed so powerful.  It was, and I loved
it.  Every project we started (each of our projects has a separate issue ID,
similar to Trac) was a different branch.  So I'd work on my ticket for a day
or so, write lots of code, and get it to work.  I'd commit whenever I
reached a logical pause point (whenever I'd finished enough code to test it)
and finally merge it back into trunk when it was ready to go.  Trunk only
ever showed merges from completed projects, so it stayed very clean ... but
if you found a problem in the code downstream, you could always track it
back to the actual developer and changeset.

In the end, though, we went with Mercurial.  It's very similar to Git, but
with slightly less command line power.  We went that direction, though,
because the SVN-to-Hg repository conversion tools were better and because
TortoiseHg was more stable than TortoiseGit at the time.  We still follow
the same workflow - each project is a separate branch - and it's working
wonders.

The biggest complaints I have about SVN: branching/merging is a hassle and I
can't commit as I work on projects.  As I said before, I like to work in
stages when I'm working on a larger project and being able to commit to
something to track my changes is really what I want to accomplish.  I
commit *everything* when I get to a logical stopping point and can test,
whether I'm done with the project or not.  When I'm on my own repo, no one
cares how many commits I have.  When I'm on a shared repo, I work in a
branch so no one cares until I merge but they can still see my changes,
create diffs based on my branch, and test/critique/contribute to my branch
as I work on it.

So in the end, Git and Mercurial work for me.  So does Subversion.  And yes,
switching from any one tool to any other *will* be difficult.  You'll have
to re-learn old behaviors and come up-to-speed with a new platform.  But it
can be done, and you have to consider more than your own workflow when
making a decision.  When I first learned the local versus hub repository
system of Git I hated it with a passion.  I was used to Subversion and I
didn't see the value in having my own local repository.  But I gave it a
try.

For me the mental block with SVN stems from not using it (as previously 
stated). I suppose I just need to break down and learn/use it for a 
project and then weigh in with a more balanced opinion. Just as someone 
else stated others needed to do with their Git experience.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Post Types and Media Attachments
Message-ID: <AANLkTimj3FKjqiOc9itFqU78rPozv+7FcE1J2E9hrAHt@mail.gmail.com>

I am currently working on a project that utilizes a custom post type
with custom meta boxes. I have removed the default content editor for
this custom post type ['supports' => array('title', 'thumbnail')]. In
one of the custom meta boxes, I have a textarea with a WYSIWYG editor.
I would like to be able to embed images into the content of this
textarea using the WordPress Media Library. I was able to add the
*Upload/Insert* icons above the editor by using some code I found in a
tutorial online.

The interface for adding/editing a post for my custom post type can be
seen here:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10219458/Screenshots/WordPress/custom-post-type.gif

Clicking on the *Add an Image* icon in the *Products* meta box does
open the media library/upload interface in a lightbox. I am able to
upload an image, and it is attached to the post (of the custom post
type). However, the *Insert into Post* button is not there for the
image so that I can insert the newly uploaded image into my custom
textarea editor. The *Insert into Post* button is also missing when I
try to add the same image to a regular Post or Page. I *am* able to
set this image as the featured image for my custom post type.

This screenshot shows what I get when I upload an image from the
*Products* meta box. As you can see, the *Insert into Post* button is
missing.
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10219458/Screenshots/WordPress/uploaded-image.gif

If I try to insert an image (into my custom textarea editor) that has
been attached to either a Post or a Page or one that has been uploaded
via the Media Library interface (and is attached to nothing), the
*Insert into Post* button *is* available, and I can successfully
insert it into the textarea in the *Products* meta box.

I did a test for another custom post type (on a different project)
where I do have the default content editor ['supports' =>
array('title','editor')] and no custom meta boxes. When I uploaded an
image, it was attached to the post (of that custom post type) and the
*Insert into Post* button *was* available.

So ... it appears that as long as I upload an image to the main
content editor, the *Insert into Post* button is available wherever I
need to insert the image, even into a custom meta box field. But if I
upload an image from a custom meta box field, the *Insert into Post*
button goes MIA.

That long winded explanation leads me to my question ... is the
WordPress Media Library only really supported by the main content
editor and featured image? Is it not meant to be used to add images to
custom meta box fields?

Or is this a bug?

Or have I screwed up my code somewhere along the line? (BTW ... I'm
running WP 3.0.3)

Thanks in advance for any help.

I think this is the biggest problem with all these discussions.

Understanding what a VCS is for, and why you need to use one, and what you
need to do with one, is fundamental.

That understanding should come first, before "how do I use the particular
tool"

Unfortunately most people want "what buttons do I press/commands do I type"
with no understanding of why. However, as soon as something goes awry, or a
message comes back that isn't in the 'script' people get lost and often
assume the tool is hard.

This comes down to team development discipline. Again the tool doesn't
really matter, the principals do. (And please don't anyone raises the ugly
subject of exclusive locking -- it doesn't work -- that's why none of the
modern VCSs encourage it).

But you could have done that in subversion (or CVS before that).

The key is understanding that you should work on a branch for all but the
most trivial changes, when working in a team environment. The next important
thing is regular and controlled merges.

The alternative is a gatekeeper model (which is what WordPress works on -
but for different reasons: cathedral versus bazaar)

This is where the git versus subversion argument for WordPress is
pointless.

WordPress works on a cathedral model, so it doesn't matter how easy git and
it's friends are at doing branch merges (which is the only selling point I'm
hearing), there's no great advantage when the core commits are controlled by
the high priests (core committers).

By the way, I *don't* think that model should change. WordPress is as good
as it is *because* of the cathedral model. (But I do wish they would (learn
to) do branch merges for bug fixes instead of applying patches in two places
- but's that's just personal -- it irks me to see someone so talented
wasting their time doing something the software should do)

I think that's just down to experience and practice/discipline. I used to
manage up to 10 simultaneous branches of development for a 13 -person team
in CVS! Doing it in SVN would be a doddle!

Which is why TortoiseGIT works exactly the same as TortoiseSVN in this 
regard.  You can do a diff, you can diff with previous versions and save 
the result.. The method of distributing patches probably won't change.  
The functionality is all there.  Using a tool is irrelevant as you can 
do it with or without.

I favorited a tweet on this last month.  It seems appropriate..
"@sdenike based on dev friends ditching SVN for Git it's mature enough. 
Also, use the CLI you lazy jerkface. You don't need a 3rd party app." -

No, I couldn't.

Since the WordPress SVN repository lives on the WordPress servers and I
don't have commit access there, I can't branch the repository and commit my
changes to that branch.  If I'm using a *local* SVN repository on my own
network I can, but then I've manually recreated a Git/Mercurial workflow by
trying to bridge between two repositories.  Why reinvent the wheel when
other tools have automated that process?

Becky, I don't have a solution but wondering why if you are creating a custom post type you chose not to use the default WYSIWYG editor available? Why go through the trouble of creating your own meta box which would be the same thing?

Sorry, I thought you were talking about a non-WordPress project, as your
previous section had been about a .net project. Sorry for the
misunderstanding.

By the way, Subversion does 'vendor branches' (at least that's the cvs name
for them) that allow you to manage an external copy of a repository and keep
updating it (pull in new code), as well as have your own code in the same
repository.

I used to manage my copy of the b2 repository that way, back when using
'plugins' meant you had to modify core to include them.

That's disappointing to hear. Can the bundled phpmailer be called directly rather than through the WP API to make sending HTML email easier?

I'm using the "Custom Field Plugin" to achieve the same thing (WYSIWYG 
Editor on custom fields) for customers where the design needs seperate 
"editing frames" on one page. This plugin works fine with the media 
library and allows to insert uploaded images directly into the custom 
meta field using the "insert to post" button.

Maybe you can take use of that, or reverse engineer this functionality.

Hope this helps.
Greetings from Germany,
Malte

Just checking in here, has anyone here ever attempted to activate
another plugin (or ensure it's activated, if not, then activate it)
within a plugin? For example, when activating Plugin B, the Plugin B
will activate Plugin A first (or if Plugin A is activated, continue;
if Plugin A doesn't exist then send error to browser), then complete
the rest of Plugin B specific activation.

I have the craziest of thoughts!

Just looking at the class under wp-includes/class-phpmailer.php

You can instantiate your own instance of PHPMailer. And this class has functions like isHTML(). 

  function IsHTML($bool) {
    if($bool == true) {
      $this->ContentType = 'text/html';
    } else {
      $this->ContentType = 'text/plain';
    }
  }

Similarly, there is isSMTP()

 function IsSMTP() {
    $this->Mailer = 'smtp';
  }

Not seeing what the issue is for you. I would advise not the start including duplication of functionality local to your plugin which is already in WordPress. Sort of like developers shipping their plugin with a local copy of jQuery. Just adds bloat and many times conflict to the user's system. My opinion anyway for what it is worth.

Not sure how helpful this might be, but I know the Gravity Forms
Addons<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gravity-forms-addons/>plugin
requires the Gravity Forms plugin in order to function properly. It
doesn't appear to require that it be activated in order to itself be
activated, though. The developer(s) might have some insight, though.

Nah, it's not so crazy. You can use is_plugin_activated() and
activate_plugin().

Or, just add a header and forget about it:

It's doable. You can use the is_plugin_active (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_plugin_active) and
activate_plugin
functions. (Though, it might be better to do a function_exists /
class_exists check instead if you already have specifics of the plugin).

Examples:
scribu has a sweet plugin that handles dependencies (
http://scribu.net/wordpress/plugin-dependencies).

I wrote a similar one too that installs and activates required plugins for
you (but it requires action from the user to install/activate the
dependencies) (
http://code.google.com/p/living-stories/source/browse/installer/living-story-installer.php?repo=wordpress&r=6036037fa0e338b15e032d4c1e5d31563b20f55a
).

Paul -

Using the main/default WYSIWYG editor is something we are considering
doing, but I would need to figure out how to move it down to the
bottom of the interface so as to not confuse the client when they are
entering data (I did find a tutorial online telling me how to do
that). That still wouldn't really completely solve the underlying
issue that I ran into.

What if I have the main/default WYSIWYG editor and 2 custom meta boxes
with WYSIWYG editors and the WP Media Library *Upload/Insert* icons? I
would still encounter this issue if I tried to upload an image from
one of the custom meta boxes (I believe ... I haven't tested to
confirm this).

I'm wondering if I have something set up wrong or if it is something
in the WP core that is causing some sort of link to be missed when an
image is uploaded from a custom meta box.

I was going to dig into the code to see what is rendering that *Insert
into Post* button in the media library lightbox, but I have not had a
chance yet.

As long as you tell us what version your patch is against that will be great.

Any patch is better than no patch :-)

A large %age of the time the patch will apply (maybe with some fuzz) and if not it can be manually applied in a number of different ways.

I ran across that plug-in a few times, but I haven't checked it out
yet. If I get a chance today, I will probably check it out. Hopefully
it works with Custom Post Types. If nothing else, maybe I can dig into
its code to see how it is using the media library and re-purpose that
for my needs.

Yeah, a lot of people don't seem to get that. Patches will apply to
any version of WordPress, as long as the differences are not too
great. So usually a patch made against stable will apply to trunk, or
vice-versa. The "patch" tool has always been able to do "fuzzy"
patching of diffs. It's not great at it, but it does work for the most
part.

Now, somebody else said that git's patch system works better because
it can track movement of code across files better and it has more
information to work with, and from my research last night, that is
probably true. But generally speaking, unless you're trying to patch
something that has been refactored in a fairly major way anyway, the
normal diff/patch system can often handle it. In the case of
conflicts, you can go back in and just manually fix the affected
lines.

And if the system has been altered enough to where patch just throws
up and says no, then the diff probably needs to be refreshed anyway.
This is true for all systems.

@scribu - Something like 'Plugin Dependencies' or 'Child Plugins'
could probably be in Core, you think that's likely to be on the
roadmap for 3.2 or 3.x?

+1 to that

I've seen several plug-ins that depend on one or another *other *plug-ins
... as well as some themes that depend on the functionality provided by
other plug-ins.  Usually, a savvy developer throws in an
`if(function_exists('...'))` check to be safe, but not always.  And if
someone disables the required plug-in, everything breaks.  It would be nice
if WordPress could detect this automatically.

I know a few Twitter and Facebook plug-ins I installed a while ago actually
set up 4-5 different plug-ins that served different purposes.  I didn't need
them, and thoughtlessly tried to delete one of the "included" plug-ins only
to watch WordPress delete them all (because they were in the same folder).
 So being able to predict both kinds of dependencies would be awesome.

I'm considering putting this into BuddyPress Like, as it
(unsurprisingly) depends on BuddyPress.

Don't know about 3.2, but I would hope something like that gets in before WP
4.0, yeah. :-)

I'm about to tackle a problem which will rely on this as a dependency - 
have you completed this work, and would you be willing to share? I'd 
hate to have to duplicate all that work (but I will, and am already 
starting).

Subject: [wp-hackers] After Publish Revisions
Message-ID: <4D027248.6010308@unFocus.com>

Hi all,

I'm going to add the ability to edit a post (and it's metadata) after it 
has been published but not to take affect immediately (meaning an editor 
or admin will have to approve the changes). I'm going to add all the 
necessary new capabilities and custom post_status, and build off the 
existing auto_save and revisions system in WP. I want to do this as 
cleanly as possible - model it on the way existing systems work in WP core.

Is there any info that might help with this - history on previous 
attempts at it, etc.?

Here is a quick initial stab at some of the data stuff:

I'm guessing I'll need to add:
post_type:    publish_revision
post_status: inherit

Alternatively, for custom post types:
post_type:    custom_post_name
post_status: publish_revision

Or it might require both, I'm not sure yet - and I'll be essentially 
modifying the" after publish revision" (for lack of a better term) to 
match an auto-draft (post_status) or a revision (post_type) by resetting 
the post_name, and post_parent fields.

I'm just starting this process, and will be testing various things today.

Thanks,

Kevin N.

FYI, BuddyPress provides actions for other plugins to hook into to avoid dependancy errors; take a look at http://codex.buddypress.org/plugin-development/checking-buddypress-is-active/

Cheers Paul,

I have this in at the moment, and throw a friendly error telling the
user to activate BuddyPress with a link sending them to the plugins
page. I'd prefer this link to actually activate BuddyPress, but just
need to generate the nonce for that activate link.

Many thanks William and Paul. I actually wasn't aware that phpmailer  
was built in until I saw this thread. Thanks for the headsup and tips.  
I retract my advice to the other poster to include phpmailer with his  
plugin.

Looking into this more deeply, it looks like setting up the hooks for 
versioned metadata can be done pretty cleanly where the custom post type 
(and additional meta data) is defined and created (in the originating 
plugin).

Seems like doing this globally (for all metadata) would be a dirty hack.

Okay, THAT is a much better answer than what I've been hearing.  Expect more patches from me.  Thanks.

Like for the issue I *just* found where the parent name the admin manage list is pulled directly from $parent->post_title instead of get_post_title($parent->ID).  With the qTranslate plugin, which stores all different title translations into the title itself, the results get really ugly, and I can't fix it for the client because there are no hooks:

For me I've never seen that written anywhere and I've been looking for it.  I've been struggling for a while to get that simple answer.

I guess when I can read and trace through the code with a debugger I can figure it out.  But I can't do that for SVN (I don't have the skill to trace that code.)

Question: what happens if the line numbers change?  I've seen a lot of cases where the latest function is identical but other code in the same file has changed.

The original GNU patch had a fairly primitive fuzzy matching system.
Modern implementations tend to use smarter algorithms to better detect
where and how to make a patch from a diff. They're fairly far from
perfect, but all of them can generally handle line numbers being
wrong. That's why diff's include context around changes as well, to
provide the unchanged lines to look for and such.

The domain mapping plugin uses it. The sunrise there determines what
url you're trying to get then switches you to the correct blog.

Not sure this is exactly the same issue, but a while back I ran into
something similar, and it turned out the media-upload code was not getting
the post_id value, and thus had no way to associate the upload with the post
fully. Best I can tell, this value has to be set in the javascript. Once
that was done both the Insert button showed up, and I had a correctly
associated image, ie the attachment's parent value was set correctly. This
was with a regular input with a file type and not a textarea, but sounds
like similar enough symptoms. The little bit of javascript that worked for
me, was adding the post_id to this statement:

        tb_show('', 'media-upload.php?post_id=' + post_id +
'&amp;type=image&amp;TB_iframe=true');

The tutorial I first found, had left out that post_id part. Prior to this of
course, the js post_id var would need to be set.

I agree. For Subversion, I've *always* used TortoiseSVN, for two reasons:

   1. The Subversion CLI has always seemed like a bit of a black box to
      me. Not sure why, maybe I just didn't take the time to learn it
      properly.
   2. The way I like to work is: work on a bunch of files, then, commit
      the individual bits out of that, by picking and choosing files.
      The TortoiseSVN UI lets me do that, and I haven't found how to do
      that with the CLI (see #1)

For the former, this is likely my fault. I've read the SVN book and a
bunch of other material a lot, but never felt like I had a full
understanding of it. On the other hand, the short tutorials for Git got
me up to speed in no time, and although there are some bits I'm a little
fuzzy on (fast-forwarding merges, for one), this is purely because I
don't need to know about them.

Regarding the latter, I feel that this is one place Git shines, and is
probably my single favourite feature. Because of the way Git is
structured (with the staging area), you can add in "patch" mode, where
Git takes a diff, splits it up into the individual parts, and asks if
you'd like to stage each one. I love this, because I can say "oh, that
bit was just a doc fix, I'll leave that for now" and commit it later.

If I had to go back to SVN, but I could take one feature with me, it
would be that. I've also not seen any of the Git GUIs do this (though, I
haven't used them much).

I felt that we were getting slightly off-topic, which is the only reason
I suggested it. But if we're all fine with discussing it on list, let's
keep it that way!

Indeed it can be, as the class is just the standard PHPMailer class.

Check out wp-includes/ms-settings.php. Sunrise gets included early. If
$current_site and $current_blog are set by sunrise, then nearly all of the
logic in that file gets skipped.

In there, you'll find a lot of logic to determine exactly which network and
blog you're trying to reach. The purpose of sunrise is to optionally
override all of that. Domain mapping is one such use case, for sure.

Custom post statuses aren't quite fullt there...see
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12706

Why don't you just use the pending post status?

Hi all,

I'm going to add the ability to edit a post (and it's metadata) after it has
been published but not to take affect immediately (meaning an editor or
admin will have to approve the changes). I'm going to add all the necessary
new capabilities and custom post_status, and build off the existing
auto_save and revisions system in WP. I want to do this as cleanly as
possible - model it on the way existing systems work in WP core.

Is there any info that might help with this - history on previous attempts
at it, etc.?

Here is a quick initial stab at some of the data stuff:

I'm guessing I'll need to add:
post_type:    publish_revision
post_status: inherit

Alternatively, for custom post types:
post_type:    custom_post_name
post_status: publish_revision

Or it might require both, I'm not sure yet - and I'll be essentially
modifying the" after publish revision" (for lack of a better term) to match
an auto-draft (post_status) or a revision (post_type) by resetting the
post_name, and post_parent fields.

I'm just starting this process, and will be testing various things today.

Thanks,

Kevin N.

If you want to send multipart emails, you're essentially screwed though.
phpmailer will add an extra Content-Type header (Content-Type:
multipart/alternative; charset=""), which will override your original
Content-Type with the boundary. This will still work in Thunderbird, but
Outlook will fail to see the boundary and spew your entire body out
(including boundaries) as text.

I'm working on this on #15448, but be aware of it if you're trying to
send multipart emails through wp_mail()

I wonder if something changed during the time I created patches for both the
trunk and branch. Usually, I would create a patch against trunk. SVN switch
to the branch 3.0 or branches/x.x and then apply the patch I created against
trunk to it. If it applies then I'm ready to go, if it does not, then I
modify the code for the branch and create a new patch for that version.

Mike Little explanation seems to leave off the part where you create a patch
for trunk. However, I'm tired, so I apologize if I'm a bit insane.

I think the problem is that the fundamentals of all VCS are the same. You
have merging, commits, branching, etc in each. I think you have to start
there, at the basics before you argue how much better one is over another.
If Path A and Path B both lead to C, then what does it matter which path you
take to get there? If one path is full of pot holes, dangerous robbing
murderous bandits whom force you to hide your kids, hide your wife... and
your husband too, and the other path is double rainbows all around with
raindrops and flowers then who is to say one or the other is the worse one?
Perhaps I like fending off bandits and don't really care much for my wife.

Metaphor aside, there are complexities with any VCS and what really matters
is the tools available for Windows. SVN has great tools for doing everything
that you'd want or need. The problems with people using SVN is that it
allows too much freedom to shoot oneself in the foot. GIT and the like by
its nature prevent some of the pitfalls found in SVN but introduce another,
which is namely how to merge one branch into another without too much hassle
(PS Github makes this easier, but if you are not using Github, then it seems
you'll have a lot of practicing to do, but after a while it becomes easy.
Hell Ryan can do it, so I suspect anyone can, myself excluded).

Therefore, this entire thread is pointless. It is already possible to use
GIT or another VCS that interfaces with SVN somehow. Other people have
stated GIT-SVN tool. It is possible to check out WordPress SVN into GIT, do
all of the changes there with revision control and then create a single
patch for sending to WordPress Trac. It is then also possible to merge in
changes made to the trunk of WordPress. Github is not required for doing
this. Just a PITA to do so. However, the PITA is on the one or three people
wanting to use another VCS instead of being a PITA in the core team
requiring work to be taken off of core development and fixing the problems
that creep into any change.

It wasn't pointless. It educated several people, including myself on nuances of the various VCS that (at least I've) been struggling to understand for years.  And everyone has been mostly civil.  

I think it was one of the best high-volume threads we've had in a long time.

FWIW.

As far as I can tell, the media-upload code gets the Post-ID by 
GET-Parameter when using a.) the standard wp editing frame b.) the 
editor from the custom field plugin. So for sure it has to get the post 
id that way. But wheter I call the media-upload code from standard 
editor or custom field plugin it get's the same GET parameters so the 
part, where it is told which specific part of the page the image has to 
be inserted to, must be handled somewhere in JS.

I would be really interested to know how this works.

I apologize. I should have clarified. The original goal of the thread was to
somewhat persuade WordPress Foundation to switch to Git or another
distributed VCS. In this it fails since it only briefly touches on the crux
of the issue that core commit team and core contributors have. I guess part
of the reason was the tangents about the differences between SVN and GIT.

I know of only one of the Automattic team that is already on Github and I
suspect that the only way there is going to be a change is if the core
commit team and the WordPress Foundation decides that the benefits of GIT is
worth spending the time developing the tools for providing support. I also
think the problem with the thread is assuming that SVN has to be removed
from the development cycle. GIT could be added for those who want to fork
and provide patches in that fashion. The first step is to see how well the
SVN-GIT tool works on Github and also the challenges for branching and
merging based on the SVN-GIT tool.

Oh, as an aside, it might help to think of distributed repositories as
branches. If you consider that the repository you are cloning from to be
"trunk" and your clone to be a branch of Trunk, then I think it might make
more sense. If you handle distributed clones like you would handle branches
in SVN, then it makes it a bit more easy to understand. It is just that
everyone that works with the "Trunk" has their own branch and maintains it.
When they are finished with that they are working on or what to move their
features back into the main development for other people to see, then they
merge (push) back into "Trunk" and other people merge Trunk (pull) back into
their branches to stay up-to-date. Whereas with SVN this is a PITA to do and
handle, it is a feature that is built into distributed VCS.

I really think that with GIT, it commits smaller diffs as well as doing
comparisons on diffs. I've only ever had one conflict with GIT and was
surprised when the conflict only included one line whereas the diff itself
spanned multiple lines. In SVN the conflict would have been the 3 or 4 lines
and in GIT it was only 1. That for me is what sold GIT. GIT was built on
merging and branching and that is its strength. By SVNs very nature it does
not want you to branch except for the most extreme situations.

I don't think I've heard such inaccuracies about Subversion for quite a
while! Subversion has branching at the very heart of its design like any
good VCS should. One of the driving forces behind the development of
Subversion was to address some of the problems with branching in CVS.
One area in particular: branching in subversion is a fixed-cost 'cheap'
operation (contrary to some other inaccurate info I saw on this thread in
passing).

But, as I tried to say before in my earlier message on this thread, the
point is moot.

Whilst the development of WordPress is *not* distributed (and it is not) and
whilst the final result of all contributions is hand application of a patch
by the few core committers, there will never be any need, let alone
advantage, to switching away from Subversion.

Git and it's friends might work really well for distributed Bazaar-like
development, but WordPress uses the Cathedral model.

Meanwhile, as has been mentioned on this thread, anyone can take a copy of
the repository from subversion into Git and work with it that way, but, in
the end, you still need to produce a patch to give to the team.

I don't see how that's different from Linux Kernel Development, where all
patches went through Linus (at least at first), yet it uses git from day
one.

Also, I don't think WordPress is developed in a Cathedral style at all.

I was not writing about technical, but methodology on branching. Subversion
by design of being centralized wants everyone to work on the same Trunk or
branch. You can see this with WordPress.org development, so don't tell me
I'm wrong. I do not see many feature branches and this is what I'm talking
about. The very nature of GIT or decentralized is one which wants you to
work on branches and then merge back into the main. Is this or is this not
true?

I could go into more details, but it has already been described. I think
someone should go through and provide a detailed summary of this thread.
Most of the information is of value and when this comes up in another 6 or 7
months, it would benefit those people to already have a guide of what was
debated. I think I might start it, since it may help me convince people in
the future.

I have been using update_usermeta and get_usermeta because sometimes the string comes back empty and i'm totally lost on it's usage.

Basically I have 
get_user_meta($current_user->ID,'comicpress-is-member', true);

to get the user meta is-member tag

and updating 

update_user_meta($id, 'comicpress-is-member', $comicpress_is_member);

where id = (int)$_POST['user_id'])  in my save filter.



The problem is my understanding with WPMS, does this flag carry over to all blogs? or just the main one, i'm a little lost on this one after reading the conversation  in the list recently.

Basically I want to get and store the information on the main blog but have it available and used on all subblogs as well.

Just because the WordPress team don't choose to use the branch and merge
features of Subversion doesn't mean it *can't* support them.

Subversion's design does *not* "want everyone to work on the same trunk and
branch". It seems you are mistaking a centralised repository as being a
restriction on branches that can be created and worked on.

I have worked with a lot revision control systems from a home grown one
(built from DOS batch files and pkzip in 1990), through RCS/MKS, PVCS,
Visual Source Safe, CVS, CVSNT, Perforce, and Subversion.
Of those only the first and RCS/MKS did not support branches -- though PVCS
and VSS had very poor branch support. But with every other system, I have
*always* created branches for feature development and release support.

For some of those systems, I have supported development teams on three
continents across 4 timezones, each with their own multiple branches. I have
managed the version control of projects with up to 10 parallel branches of
development, again for both release support and for multiple overlapping
feature development streams.

It seems you may be mistaken in believing that because Git encourages (and
makes easier) branch and merge development, that it is the only one that
supports that. Not so.

The error object is produced by the "authenticate" filter and
wp_authenticate_username_password(). If you hook into that filter with
a later priority, you can check the error object and change it
accordingly.

You can also use the "login_errors" filter (which is called in
wp-login.php) though unfortunately that is the error string to be
shown, so you would have to do some (error prone) string matching.

With themes if you utilise a sub directory you can hide files from the

Is there similar functionality to hide files from the plugin editor? I 
don't mind if it's a filter, but could do with something to stop some 
files from edited.

I looked through he code, but couldn't see anything.

Any ideas?

That sounds like a bug in the theme editor to me. You shouldn't be
able to "hide" anything from the administrator.

How about just removing the Editor menu option, would that suffice?

ugh. I have a couple of files, well one in particular, that I copy 
elsewhere so that updates don't interfere with it.

Guess I'll have to create rather than copy. I'm just trying to lessen 
the number of people editing the wrong file.

Don't think so, it's too broad. Plus being able to edit majority of

Does anyone have any thoughts on the best and most appropriate way to protect (as much as possible) a premium plugin from hacking and redistribution? I have considered a check with a remote server to verify membership/payment etc but what's to stop a half decent developer just removing those checks? Obfuscation? 

Any help or advice is massively appreciated!

Don't sell code, sell support around the code. Simple as that (or not).

Excellent suggestion.

Or make the plugin access your servers for the key essential code, and control that access.

In short, anything you put on someone else's computer can be stolen.

I agree. Selling support is certainly a great way of doing it. 

I had considered having key code on a remote server but wondered if that went against the 'ethos' of wordpress as a community? 

Do you think profiting (or trying to) by utilising the wordpress platform is immoral or wrong in anyway? Not in terms of being paid to develop or design for wordpress. But in the sense that we can build something on top of the platform that we then charge for?

Agreed.  If it works for BackupBuddy, Gravity Forms and Shopp, it is a 
proven approach.

But if in the end you do go with obfuscation, don't use ZendGuard 
because it will eliminate all servers that want to use an APC opcode 
cache.  Choose something like IONCube if you feel you have to go that 
route.  If you use WHM, you could also look into how WHMCS's licensing 
solution works. It is inexpensive and provides the selling solution for it.

I'm biased, I run a hosting company that only does WordPress hosting, so
I don't think there's anything wrong with it :).

People have been bottling water and charging for it for a few centuries
(contrary to popular belief that bottled water is something new).

The people who are paying you, is because they choose to, as long as you
don't cut off people who want to do it for free, you're ethically fine..
as long as you don't rename it to JealousPress or something, you should
also have no problem sleeping at night.

We offer WordPress hosting, and on top of that some of the stuff we've
built around WordPress from a hosting standpoint, we put on github
(provisioning stuff)..

Our competitors can use our own code against us, we welcome it.

All our customers know that WordPress is free, we actually use that as a
selling point, the number of agencies that tie people into some
proprietary crap cms is amazing..

Think of us like the RedHat of WordPress, we have our own stuff, that
you can download and use yourself, or you can host with us, and we
support our own stuff..

Anyway, this is starting to sound more of a rant.. so.. I'm gonna
stop. But, you should not have any trouble sleeping at night :)

Ha! JealousPress. Has a ring to it! 

I agree with you. I too am always very open about the fact that wordpress is open source and free. As you say, clients tend to see it as a plus point. Large support community, developers etc etc. 

I think that obfuscation may be a little arrogant of me! I mean it's a bit like assuming people will try to hack it 'because it's so great'! 

I think I will look at storing key code remotely and serving it in to the plugin. Seems more friendly!

The more I think about it the more I agree that selling support seems to be the way forward. 

Thank you!

Andy

Having code on a remote server just for the purpose of locking it away
in order to charge is against the ideals of open source, and
WordPress. It's also frowned on by .org and you may find your plugin
removed if you do such a thing.

Having a plugin that is a client interface to access a server/hosted
service (like Akismet) is just fine.

*I agree. Selling support is certainly a great way of doing it.

Ok that's interesting. 

What is your opinion on things like shopp? You can't deny they provide an excellent product and while for the most part it is free you will still have to pay for certain (very useful) features. Are they wrong?

What is your opinion on charging clients for development then? Surely charging for a plugin/service is simply paying back the initial investment of time that was put in to it? And covers the ongoing provision of service and maintenance. Is it not the same thing? Surely you would not give code away due it being for an open source platform?

I am not saying these are my opinions really. I am undecided. I'm interested in knowing the general consensus on premium plugins. It doesn't seem to be something that's discussed much and there certainly isn't a lot online about premium plugin development.

I'm going to agree with Michael here, if you're looking at having remote
code execution or obfuscation you're focusing on the wrong thing...

Focus on building a kickass plugin that people will want to use, and be
upfront about your costs. See how backupbuddy, gravity, and some others
are doing it. They seem to be running a fairly nice business out of it.

Also look at all the premium themes out there, they seem to be doing
well too.

Another tactic to dissuade you from going down the license enforcement
thing.....think of your licensing scheme, and specifically your remote
code hosting stuff, your expenses and liability grow through the
roof..if your server goes down, other sites go down.. or lose that
functionality.. enjoy sending refunds...

Basically, what you're talking about is DRM, and that, I think is
morally wrong :).


And one last thing, I used to be very involved in software cracking back
in the 90s.. involved enough to personally know people who went to jail
for software piracy... you will never be able to build a lock, I or
someone else will not be able to pick.

Locks only keep good people out, you're gonna lose the license/rights
management thing.

Focus on a product and service people will want to pay for, there are
more than enough honest people in the world who will pay you.

Well, Michael is the author of all in one SEO pack, he has a paid and
free version of it, internally we've been evaluating platinum seo and
his plugin.. I'd be curious about his opinion of Shopp.. but he
definitely is proof of the side saying charge for services and have
faith in humanity to actually pay you...

build a plugin that people will want to use first, a/b test your
pricing.. and go at it.

I never mentioned Shopp's model. (BTW it isn't free.) I address the issue of
locking away functionality on a server just to be able to charge for it.

I'm not sure why you think I'd be opposed to this.

No, when someone pays for a product, they aren't paying for the initial time
spent creating it, they're paying for the value of the product. Either way,
this isn't relevant.
*
*
*Is it not the same thing? Surely you would not give code away due it being

I see what you mean. Absolutely. 

Just so you know, my intention here is not solely about profit. Although I need to make a living I am also very keen to do the 'right thing'. And that means not only by the user but also by people exactly like you! It would suck to make a lot of money but be frowned upon by the community. 

 You're right that the focus should be on a kickass plugin and not how to keep people out of it. As you say, locks are there to be picked! 

So it seems like the consensus so far is that charging for a service or invested development (premium themes etc) is ok but obfuscating or preventing access to code (or similar preventative measures) really goes against the 'ethos' of wordpress. Would you agree?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Please help diagnose custom post type permalink problem
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=E0G-tu9C7Xt2+eK-NWtcny4Xm_4U_RJy3iXeq@mail.gmail.com>

I'm appealing for help diagnosing a problem with a plugin that uses custom
post types. This is the worst type of problem to solve - an intermittent
one. The plugin is working fine for me and for a couple of other people who
have tried it. However, I've had two people report that they get 404 errors
when they try click on the permalinks associated with the posts.

This is an event management plugin. At one point, I thought the 'event' slug
I was using for my custom post type might be clashing with categories or
pages in the permalink hierarchy tagged 'event.' However, I've changed the
slug from 'event' to 'rsvpmaker' and that doesn't seem to have solved the
problem.

The developer I've been corresponding with says it works on one of the
WordPress sites she is managing but not the other. I haven't been able to
figure out what the difference might be. I had her do a data dump of the
contents of the $wp_rewrite object and confirmed that the array of rewrite
directives is being generated properly on the problem system.

Any ideas on how to track this down?

The plugin is posted here:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rsvpmaker/

The register_post_type code is:

function create_post_type() {

  register_post_type( 'rsvpmaker',
    array(
      'labels' => array(
        'name' => __( 'RSVP Events' ),
        'add_new_item' => __( 'Add New Event' ),
        'edit_item' => __( 'Edit Event' ),
        'new_item' => __( 'Events' ),
        'singular_name' => __( 'Event' )
      ),
    'menu_icon' => WP_PLUGIN_URL.'/rsvpmaker/calendar.png',
	'public' => true,
    'publicly_queryable' => true,
    'show_ui' => true,
    'query_var' => true,
    'rewrite' => true,
    'capability_type' => 'post',
    'hierarchical' => false,
    'menu_position' => 5,
    'supports' => array('title','editor','author','excerpt'),
	'taxonomies' => array('rsvpmaker-type')
    )
  );


  // Add new taxonomy, make it hierarchical (like categories)
  $labels = array(
    'name' => _x( 'Event Types', 'taxonomy general name' ),
    'singular_name' => _x( 'Event Type', 'taxonomy singular name' ),
    'search_items' =>  __( 'Search Event Types' ),
    'all_items' => __( 'All Event Types' ),
    'parent_item' => __( 'Parent Event Type' ),
    'parent_item_colon' => __( 'Parent Event Type:' ),
    'edit_item' => __( 'Edit Event Type' ),
    'update_item' => __( 'Update Event Type' ),
    'add_new_item' => __( 'Add New Event Type' ),
    'new_item_name' => __( 'New Event Type' ),
    'menu_name' => __( 'Event Type' ),
  ); 	

  register_taxonomy('rsvpmaker-type',array('rsvpmaker'), array(
    'hierarchical' => true,
    'labels' => $labels,
    'show_ui' => true,
    'query_var' => true,
    'rewrite' => array( 'slug' => 'rsvpmaker-type' ),
  ));

}

//make sure new rules will be generated for custom post type
add_action('admin_init', 'flush_rewrite_rules');


I include add_action('admin_init', 'flush_rewrite_rules'); to regenerate the
rewrite rules whenever a user is logged in.

Any suggestions about how to figure this out would be appreciated.

Ethos, common sense for you, etc :).

The model's been proven.

I also agree with Michael (I guess it's agree with Michael day?), people
aren't paying for the amount of time and sweat you put into the plugin. :)

I have a query in to the site owner on both those points (.htaccess and
caching setup). Has the standard .htaccess for WordPress changed with recent
releases? I wonder if the site might be using a .htaccess with code
generated for a previous 2.x version.

The site in question definitely does have permalinks enabled.

Thanks for that. So what is your actual opinion on premium plugins and their implementation?

This comment caught my eye.  I'd like to explore it objectively hopefully without triggering emotional responses.  Upfront I'll state that I'm not taking a position on this, I want to explore the legal, cultural and philosophical issues.

I'm going to start with the postulate that all plugins for WordPress must be GPL.  Matt has taken that position, many people in the WordPress community have agreed, and the SFLC has backed him up with their opinions. So we'll run with that as a given.

As far as I know (and IANAL) the GPL requires that any software that chooses the GPL as it's license gives full freedom to redistribute to any receiver of the software, and that of course by license is required of anyone who builds software based on the GPL. No disputing that.  

On the other hand, and again AFAIK the GPL does not require that a software developer who builds software based on the GPK actually distribute it.  So if I build a really fancy website based on WordPress with lots of custom extensions then nobody has the right per GPL to demand that I get them a copy of the source code from my website.

By the same token if a developer creates a plugin architected into components, one of which they distribute and one of which they run on their own protected server then are they not completely within the letter *and* the spirit of the GPL?  If not, would that not make Google and Amazon and Yahoo and others who run open source software on their servers "in the wrong?"

Thus far, based on ThesisGate a few months back it appears that the prevailing argument in the WordPress community is that "The GPL requires that plugins be GPL" which is consistent with our opening postulate.  But if the GPL doesn't require it what is it that is defining it to be right or wrong?

Or is it a cultural things which says "For the WordPress community, and especially if it relates to WordPress.org and WordPress.com, then it must get our 'seal of approval' much like how you have to get Apple's approval to be in the AppStore." Which if so would be perfectly okay (assuming it were objective and written down.) Except ,if it is a cultural thing isn't it a slippery slope to try to apply a subjective criteria like "If it's like Akismet it's okay but if it's just functionality I've locked away not it's not okay?"  Wouldn't we find ourselves getting into hair splitting if that's the rule? 

Or is it more philosophical like the "Definition of Pornography" [1] in that those in the community who hold influence get to decide and based on their influence their decision holds sway?

I guess my reason for asking is that I'm uncomfortable the *uncertainty* of the criteria much like those who argue for locking in the Bush Tax cuts argue that the tax uncertainty is bad for business (sorry in advance to non-US members of the list who'd wish never to hear about US politics again.) 

So I wonder if it's not a bad thing that "the GPL" is used as justification for things which GPL does not actually require but might instead be cultural? If yes, then it would be nice if those cultural norms were disconnected from having a GPL connotation and codified somewhere in writing so that people don't violate them accidentally.  

Or if it merely based on the changeable opinions of those with influence, and thus more easily applied by them based upon who is asking and their general level of grumpiness at the time?

Basically if these decisions are arbitrary and not based upon something written that the community could have involvement in deciding then I think it is really bad thing for long term health of the platform.  If someone wants to build a business based on WordPress don't we owe it to them to have objective criteria for what is Good(tm) and what is Bad(tm), why, and what will occur if they exhibit Bad Behavior(tm)? (with no intent to reference to the ant-spam of the same name.  Pun intended. :)

Anyway, I'm curious to hear other's opinions on the subject.

David,
 Can you share the site url? The problem you describe is hard to
diagnose as a thought problem. If we had the url, we could inspect the
headers, and try to see if we can replicate the issue, or possibly find
an isuse on the server itself..

Objectively..

- - Very few people, including lawyers understand the GPL or any software
license. In the end most people care about enforceability of a license,
law, and how effective it's going to be in getting the results you want.


- - I don't think the "approval" matters as much for commercial plugins,
you can't get backupbuddy, or gravityforms from .org/extend .. yet they
are fairly well known plugins...

- - I think the guidelines to be listed on .org are fairly clear, must
pass a coding standard..

- - the community as a whole works fairly well, in recommending for a
specific plugin, but there's always the issue of finding an influential
user who will recommend it.. etc etc.. and then you go back to the
normal way of figuring out how any open source project gets traction.

- - Which goes back to my earlier recommendation, of solve a problem no
one has, or solve it in a fashion no one has.. aka. build something
people want, and get it into their hands as quickly as possible.

So true...

So if someone were to write a plugin but host it themselves, anything goes (as long as it's GPL?)

Do you mean these? http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/  (I googled for "guidelines for submission to WordPress plugin directory" and it took me a while to find that as it was not linked directly for that search.)

I don't see anything there that says a plugin cannot interact with services where the developer choses to architect some of the functionality on the server.  I'm not saying I'm against such a prohibition (nor for it per se) just that I don't see where it's written as an official statement that is is "Wrong(tm)."

I wasn't asking about recommendation, I was asking about what in essence would be demonization by influentials for someone doing something Bad(tm) and being able to know objectively what that would be in advance  The question wasn't concerned about reactive approvals but instead proactive attacks.

True, build something people want and they will reward you with usage. But not necessarily a viable business.  With respect to WordPress plugins there are over 10k plugins in the repository but only 4 vendors that appear to have a viable business that we can name.  Just sayin...

Anyway, back to the thesis: Is it wrong to architect a plugin that hosts some of its code on the server? And if so, why is there nothing official written to that effect? Or is it just one man's opinion?

(Mea culpa if something has been written and I haven't been able to find it, but then I would suggest maybe it could be more prominent?)

get_user_meta gets stored in the global usermeta table without a prefix, so
yes, it would be for all blogs.

For others on the list, if you *do* want this to be per-blog, on the other
hand, the trick is to key it with the database prefix. But *don't* do that
on your own -- use get_user_option() and friends, which will do it for you.

Not from day one -- Git was invented to be used on the kernel.

The point is, it's extremely different. The kernel uses a lieutenants
system. They have a hierarchy of branches, each with their own gatekeeper,
for many different modules, submodules, and components. When the merge
window opens, Linus accepts patches that his lieutenants have signed off on.
He doesn't read, and certainly doesn't audit or test, all of them -- the
entire system is built on a hierarchy of trust and a hierarchy of branches.

WordPress does not use a lieutenants system. There are five active primary
gatekeepers for a single branch of code, three leads and two with permanent
commit. There are also four component committers currently, two permanent
and two guest, who operate under the advice of the lead developers, but it's
a circle of trust, rather than a hierarchy. It's heavily centralized, with
everyone with the same powers and responsibilities on the same branch of
code. Mike Little described it best:

"Whilst the development of WordPress is *not* distributed (and it is not)
and
whilst the final result of all contributions is hand application of a patch
by the few core committers, there will never be any need, let alone
advantage, to switching away from Subversion."

I think Mike's application of "cathedral" and "bazaar" is misplaced, but
don't let that take away from the key points he's made.

Jacob also made some key points:

"I was not writing about technical, but methodology on branching. Subversion
by design of being centralized wants everyone to work on the same Trunk or
branch. You can see this with WordPress.org development, so don't tell me
I'm wrong. I do not see many feature branches and this is what I'm talking
about. The very nature of GIT or decentralized is one which wants you to
work on branches and then merge back into the main. Is this or is this not
true?"

Yes, this is absolutely true. We operate on a single branch of code, with
discreet patches applied to that. We have no intention of turning our
workflow on its head. We're not in the interest of fixing what isn't broken,
and no, DCVS is not the golden solution for every developer or project.

I am going to disagree with you on this point.  plugins in the repository
must be GPL per the repo terms, however the argument can be made that a
plugin (or a theme, because alot of themes choose Creative Commons
License to require an attribution link to be displayed in the footer) is not
a derivative work.  Now that's not to say I think that GPL isn't a
requirement, I personally have no idea as I don't know enough about GPL and
the law to say.

Now the FSF, Matt, and many people in the Wordpress community may say a
plugin or theme does constitute a derivative work.  However, any person's or
organisation's opinion on that doesn't really matter, what matters is how
the courts interpret derivative work.  AFAIK I've never heard of a court
setting a precedent in this area but its not like I've researched this
though.

I just wanted to point out that that's not necessarily a given.  For
example, if I write a plugin and I decide to license it under RPL (Ryan's
Public License) which is a proprietary license I made for this project which
restricts many of these "freedoms" GPL offers, the only way around that
would to get a court to say its a derivative work of a GPL product and
therefore must explicitly be GPL to be in compliance with licensing
restrictions.  Now this is at least how I understand licensing and the law,
ect.  But I could very well be wrong, its not like I'm a lawyer or ever been
to law school.

But that point isn't such a given its too unclear.  And AFAIK that means (at
least in the US) it's up to the interpretation of the court.

Now I'm not trying to start an argument about this or anything, I just
wanted to point out that it's not necessarily a given.

LOL!  If you read what I wrote that you quoted again you'll see I worded it so as to bypass that entire issue!!! Note the use of the term "postulate", i.e. "a postulate's truth is taken for granted, and serves as a starting point for deducing and inferring other (theory dependent) truths":

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate

So basically you've disagreed with my "for argument's sake" assumption. :)

Seriously,  I wasn't stating an opinion on that, I was skirting that issue so that I could discuss the assertion Michael Tolbert made that putting functionality on a server in order to bypass distribution was wrong. I was trying to hold to that issue off to the side otherwise it opens an whole 'nuther can o' worms.  :-)

And I didn't say it was. On the contrary, I was careful to say I wasn't saying so as to avoid that debate. :)  

(but if I *were* to open discussion on that topic you might be surprised by one of the legal opinions I've gotten on the subject... :)

There are plenty more than 4 commercial plugins vendors. However, if you're
looking to sell software, you don't *have* to sell WordPress plugins, or
software based on anything in the open source world. There are plenty of
other opportunities out there.

-------

With respect to WordPress plugins there are over 10k plugins in the
repository but only 4 vendors that appear to have a viable business
that we can name.  Just sayin...

This isn't my opinion. Plugins that serve no purpose other than
needlessly as a wrapper for a premium service aren't allowed in the
directory, and if reported, they'll be removed.

--------

Is it wrong to architect a plugin that hosts some of its code on the
server? And if so, why is there nothing official written to that
effect? Or is it just one man's opinion?

Can you point to where that is written on the WordPress site?  I have never seen that as a written statement. I'm not saying it's not there just that I haven't seen it and would like to.

I'm not trying to be adversarial here, I honestly want to know, and to see things improved.

I'll get in early and before this turns in to a long thread that no-one 
wants to read, give you mine. (Ok it was written 5 hours ago when I'd 
had the sense not to hit send.  At 3am its a different story)

WordPress is built upon the ideals of Open Source Software and in 
greater or lesser degrees the GPL.

Creating and sharing code freely is part of the ideals of this 
community.  Using your own creativity to put food on the table is a 
pretty fundamental right as well.  The two do not need to be in conflict.

Whatever you do to monetize your creativity, you need to do it in a way 
that not only obeys but respects the licenses of the tools you use.  If 
you don't do both, you won't garner the respect and support of the 
people you'll need to make the product popular.

So...
1. If you create a WordPress plugin that utilizes WordPress functions to 
fulfill its purpose, it really should be open sourced & GPL.  You can 
charge to distribute it and support it & most people will respect that.
2. If you create an open source  plugin that integrates a for-charge 
service on your site, in my mind, that is fine too even if the plugin is 
otherwise useless.  However, if this is obviously just a trick to get 
around GPL, it won't be respected.  Besides if it isn't just a trick to 
get around the GPL, you'd be silly not to have an API with a  Joomla and 
Drupal interface for your product as well.
3. (This is the one I've been struggling with) If you create a script 
for closed source program, one where charging for such scripts is the 
norm, and that add-on makes integration and utilization of WordPress 
easier and doesn't call any WordPress code to do it, you have a gray 
area that is up to your own standing on software distribution. 
Personally, I think I think that it's OK as closed source, for sale 
product- yet it just kinda feels wrong...  I've held off on releasing 
something like this as I'm not convinced of whether it is disrespectful 
and meanwhile others have already released their identical products for 
sale.  So - I'm not sure where my ambiguity has gotten me.

Anyway,

That's where *I* stand on these things. It's more about white hat 
behavior than whether you might get contacted/sued over a violation of 
the GPL

I've heard this statement before a few times, but I don't think it's written
down anywhere, as it's considered common sense.

What is "common sense" for one person of one culture can be very much not common sense for another person, especially if they are not of that same culture.  And by culture I mean "open source" is a culture. 

The people who provide add-ons for Salesforce.com, for example, have a very different culture. And I can promise you most of them would not view this to be "common sense."

Lots of new people come in contact with WordPress every day, and not everyone who does has that "common sense."  If it's to be expected then it should be written down where people who might consider offering a plugin for WordPress can't help but see it.

WishList Member, wpjobboard and gdpress are all premium plugins I've

Fair point.  

I wonder how many of them have revenues that can support 5 or more employees? But I digress...

I'm sorry I wasn't trying to start any argument about this.  As such an
argument wouldn't really accomplish anything, plus I think we all know which
way the majority leans.  As I said, i don't even necessarily agree with the
point that plugins do not have to be GPL, I was simply stating that the GPL
requirement wasn't exactly self-evident, at least no more so than the
chicken coming before the egg is.  A (legitimate?) argument can be made both
ways, which really isn't the point of this discussion.

Please correct me if I'm wrong but

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/

Seems to imply that a plugin has to be gpl compatible to be hosted on .org. It does not say that a plugin not hosted on .org has to be gpl compatible. Does it?

I suppose it is difficult to monitor a plugin not hosted on the repository but I feel there should be better definition of the guidelines for plugins in general. 

It seems that profiting from plugins is a bit of a taboo subject. Is this because it is genuinely frowned upon by the community or because it is actually against the ethos of wordpress. Which may be the same thing. 

It is interesting to me that there is little online regarding premium plugin development. 

Should wordpress (matt) simply take a stance on premium plugins? Has he already?

The GPL license says that.

What information exactly do you think there should be about commercial
plugin development? That isn't the responsibility or concern of
wordpress.org. We don't care as long as you abide by the GPL, and by the
rules of wordpress.org, neither of which prohibit profiting.

Really? The gpl license is wordpress plugin specific?? 

I'm surprised to hear you say you don't care about providing information regarding premium plugin development. I hope that is not the general consensus here??

I agree that neither .org nor gpl prohibit profiting. However what seems to be unclear is how and if we protect our code. It appears to be more of a moral issue? Some one earlier mentioned common sense being objective. I totally agree. What you (as a seasoned wp dev) may deem common sense another less experienced dev may view differently.

Do you have a source for that? That would certainly be a reason for
removing the plugin from the repository.

In fact reading back through that, you are saying that the gpl states whether or not a non hosted plugin had to gpl compatible?? I don't understand....... 

Just to be clear. I am asking if gpl compatibility is only mandatory for plugins in the repository or if it is also a guideline (rule??) for non repository, premium plugins?

By the way. I in no way mean to cause an argument. I am genuinely interested in your views and opinions. However it would be good to get some solid reference rather than (well respected) opinions.

I've yet to see a plugin that isn't a derivative work of WordPress. That's
the same interpretation held by the WordPress, Drupal, and Linux projects.
Let's also not open up that can of worms, again.

Anyone who wishes to respond on that topic, though, is strongly encouraged
to time themselves how long it takes for them to write the response, then go
to http://core.trac.wordpress.org, find a bug, and spend at least that
amount of time doing something constructive with it.

No, the GPL doesn't mention WordPress plugins specifically. Please read the
license and its FAQ. Derivative works (such as plugins) must be GPL or GPL
compatible.

Not my opinion. This has been hashed out over and over in forums, blog
posts, podcasts, etc, and is explicitly talked about at
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

It may be, if it weren't wrong. WPeC is GPL, and so are the paid upgrades
for it.

 The GPL license states that derivative works must be GPL licensed too.   It
is a bit or a grey area though as to whether plugins and themes are
derivative works, the official stance is they are derivative works therefore
they must be GPL licensed, but as I have mentioned before that doesn't
necessarily make that so, an argument can be made for plugins and themes not
being derivative thus no requirements as to how they are licensed.

Plugins and themes on the WPORG repo are a diffrent thing though because you
argree to make them GPL by submitting them, its hidden in the terms on that
page you linked to.

idk about that, there are many premium plugins and themes avalible and AFAIK
I don't see that such is being frowned upon.

Ultimately I looked at every reference to wp_mail() and only found 2 that
send actual emails that I personally would find useful for my needs, the
forgot password emails and new user welcome emails.

I have opted to use the pluggability of the function to replace it with my
own version:

if ( !function_exists('wp_mail') ) :
function wp_mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers = '', $attachments =
array()) {
 return true;
}
endif;

and to take care of those emails I want I am using a hook for the forgot
password emails, and the new users emails are done in another pluggable
function I am replacing.

So that's how I've decided to deal with this, thanks all for your help.
I've learned something new about Wordpress, pluggable functions.

Um, okay. So any time we add a new wp_mail() call in core (which we surely
will), or whenever a plugin wants to send mail, no mail gets sent.

That's a cheap hack and I would not recommend that. I say this bluntly
because while it might suit your specific needs, there are a few hundred
other people who read this list, and I really would hate to see them picking
up bad techniques such as this one.

Ok that's what I was missing. My ignorance of gpl means I did not understand derivative works. Although it is still a bit grey as you say!

I'm not sure of the relevance of the timing yourself comment....

I think it's probably time to wrap this discussion up! I can feel a little tension building! 

A very interesting conversation with you all. Thank you for your help and advice!

I'm off to research derivative works under the gpl. Fun!

Thanks again.

There is a larger number of people involved than I previously knew about

and bazarr (few versus many) is  due for an update. I should go read the

Message-ID: <4D04D24D.6020602@duechiacchiere.it>

Hi all,

I'm testing the latest beta release, and noticed that in Edit Posts, the 
Author column is padded by a few pixels and long names are cut and don't 
wrap anymore. Using Firebug I saw akismet.css is using the same class 
name as Wordpress, so overriding it. Is this an expected behavior?

Thanks,
Dino.

A better way to do it is to hook into the phpmailer_init hook, and only
do the necessary stuff if you need to.

    if (strpos($phpmailer->Body, 'my_unique_string')) {
        // Make your modifications
    }

This helps you get around pretty much anything you don't like about
wp_mail(), while still being able to use the features it has.

Of course, failing that, simply use the PHPMailer class directly.

Are you using register_taxonomy() on the "rsvpmaker-type" ? I noticed you 
using taxonomy => in the register for the post type instead of 
register_taxonomy_for_object_type();

You're also using 'rewrite' => true  - instead of 'rewrite' => array( 'slug' 
=> 'rsvpmaker' ) which is fine; of course I would do: 'rewrite' => array( 
'slug' => 'comic', 'with_front' => true ),  to make sure that just in case 
if someone is using subdir installation of wpms can attach /blog/ at the 
front .. (as far as I understand how that works)

I've done a lot of work with custom post types recently and only encountered 
something like that if I wrote something out of place when it was trying to 
create the rewrite rules .. or some other plugin was interferring.

There are a few themes and plugins that check all post types instead of just 
the one they're working with.

for example they're doing this:

 $args = array(
   'public' => true,
   '_builtin' => false
   );
 $output = 'names';
 $operator = 'and';

 $post_types = get_post_types( $args , $output , $operator );


which basically gets all custom post types then working with them, so what 
is happening is its creating a different set of rewrite rules then the ones 
intended (if they work with it afterwards), ... so could you look at what 
else is running on her setup and see if it could be conflicting?

- Phil

Philip, thanks for giving me some other things to check.

The taxonomy code I'm using (adapted from an example in the codex) is below.
Don't think it's the source of the problem, which was originally reported on
an earlier release that didn't have a taxonomy added.

  // Add new taxonomy, make it hierarchical (like categories)
  $labels = array(
    'name' => _x( 'Event Types', 'taxonomy general name' ),
    'singular_name' => _x( 'Event Type', 'taxonomy singular name' ),
    'search_items' =>  __( 'Search Event Types' ),
    'all_items' => __( 'All Event Types' ),
    'parent_item' => __( 'Parent Event Type' ),
    'parent_item_colon' => __( 'Parent Event Type:' ),
    'edit_item' => __( 'Edit Event Type' ),
    'update_item' => __( 'Update Event Type' ),
    'add_new_item' => __( 'Add New Event Type' ),
    'new_item_name' => __( 'New Event Type' ),
    'menu_name' => __( 'Event Type' ),
  );

  register_taxonomy('rsvpmaker-type',array('rsvpmaker'), array(
    'hierarchical' => true,
    'labels' => $labels,
    'show_ui' => true,
    'query_var' => true,
    'rewrite' => array( 'slug' => 'rsvpmaker-type' ),
  ));

That's probably true in most cases.

But there are a lot of calls to this already in core.  Some send useful
stuff that I personally just don't want, like a notification when a comment
is awaiting moderation - generally can be useful but for me could get to be
a lot of emails.  Some of the stuff it sends to be equally as blunt is
simply. Useless, I imagine in many cases, like I noticed one that emails the
admin each time a user resets their password, now there may be times where
someone wants that but that seems to me to be probably something rare that a
plugin could do for those who might want it.

For me this makes sense to just shut down wp's email system then build my
own hooking into the actions that I want to trigger an email, and this way
it dosen't matteer to me what emails you add to core or an email adds, since
I already am setup to send every type of email I want.

I probably have a fairly unique usecase for wordpress but that's ok.
Atleast I didn't have to kill a kitten for this, lol, because I've already
had to do some core hacks.  But I thnk one of my hacks won't be necessary
after 3.1 because it a bugfix that I think will be included then.

So anyway my point is this is a good method, still alittle hackey but works,
IF you want to completly disable the wordpress email system in favor for
handling all your own emails.

I'll just leave it at that since I'm on my mobile.

Um, okay. So any time we add a new wp_mail() call in core (which we surely
will), or whenever a plugin wants to send mail, no mail gets sent.

That's a cheap hack and I would not recommend that. I say this bluntly
because while it might suit your specific needs, there are a few hundred
other people who read this list, and I really would hate to see them picking
up bad techniques such as this one.

There's get_page_by_path() but I'm honestly not sure if it works with
non-hierarchical post types. Give it a try. Beware though that this
function isn't very well optimised and it'll perform an SQL query with
each call, so if you use it lots then keep an eye on your total SQL
queries.

You know what, get_page_by_path ( $path, $output, $post_type ) does
it, didn't notice it had changed ;)

If you write some code and don't distribute it the terms of the GPL never come into play - so they can do whatever they like with it.

Opinions will vary, especially regarding the legal definition of "derivative
work" <http://bit.ly/c1WZ25>.

But what really matters is this point: while you may be within your legal
rights to distribute non-GPL WordPress Plugins/Themes, your legal right to
do so doesn't mean that the WordPress community has to welcome your exercise
of those rights. While I believe that Plugins do not inherently inherit the
WordPress GPL (unless a Plugin/Theme has actual incorporation of WordPress
core code), I likewise believe that the WordPress community has the right to
define its own ethos regarding the licensing of
WordPress-extending/dependent code.

Continuing to argue the question really is pointless. The opinion of no one
in the WordPress community - and especially those directly involved with the
Project - will change unless and/or until a case is taken to, and settled
in, court.

If you choose to distribute non-GPL Plugins, do so - but understand that in
so doing, you are effectively exiling yourself from the good graces of the
WordPress community.

And with that, I think I've used up my 16-characters' worth of
pontification...

I went back and looked at the licensing. The wording applies for their 
premium plugins - which are not GPL.

The text I was remembering is now on a new site and probably somewhat 
rearranged but it currently reads:

    *Additional Information*
    Non-profit organisations may use the Single Blogger License.
    The Business License is for any organisation that has more than one
    staff member and individuals building e-commerce sites for clients
    that have more than one staff member - currently this is the only
    difference.

At the time, I thought that applied to the core plugin as well. 
Obviously it does not.  Whether or not plugins that extend GPL plugins 
that extend WordPress must be GPL is not a debate I care to get into.  
WP eCommerce is definitely GPL and I was glad to support them with $40 + 
$10 of plugins I bought. (Even after it replaced all of that 
functionality with my own code.)

Andrew,

Actually my quote there implied that the licensing of their products was 
GPL, but I wasn't sure if it could be.  Now in fact I'm pretty sure it 
can't be GPL, though I'd be interested to find out otherwise as it 
violates my understanding of what GPL is.

Just to be clear and I really don't want to pick on Dan's plugin which 
is very cool and I support  it. It's just that this particular point 
never quite resolved itself in my mine.  You seem quite certain. So 
maybe you can clarify it for me...

On the Gold Cart plugin it says

    *Additional Information*

        * Non-profit organisations may use the Single Blogger License.

        * The Business License is for any organisation that has more
          than one staff member and individuals building e-commerce
          sites for clients that have more than one staff member -
          currently this is the only difference.



The page 
(http://getshopped.org/extend/premium-upgrades/premium-upgrades/gold-cart-plugin/) 
seems to indicate that you are buying the plugin and not it's 
distribution, or a support contract or connecting to services on their site.

Personally, I'm fine with that license and restriction. It just doesn't 
sound like GPL to my understanding of it..

"GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free 
software for all its users."

You say this is GPL compliant?

Brian,

It occurred to me today that most of those you mention have not chosen a GPL license. Doing a quick Google search of each of their domains and the letters "GPL" here is what I found:

Explicit reference to supporting GPL

-- GDPress: 
http://www.dev4press.com/2009/blog/announcements/new-dev4press-is-now-open/

-- iThemes:
http://ithemes.com/ithemes-is-going-gpl/

-- Gravity Forms:
http://www.gravityforms.com/terms-and-conditions/

-- Shopp:
http://docs.shopplugin.net/GPLv3

No reference to GPL:

-- PHPurchase
-- wp-member
-- WishList Member
-- WPJobBoard

GPL for non-Pro version, unclear about the rest:

-- All-in-one-SEO Pro (I had to look long and hard to determine if the Pro version was in-fact GPL. I wasn't able to find any web page that said so directly but I did find that it was sold on http://wpplugins.com and they have a statement saying everything is GPL on this page: http://wpplugins.com/about/)

-- GetShopped (Base version is GPL but as mentioned before it seems that other versions are not. Not sure if Dan Milward is following this but it would be nice if he could elaborate)
http://getshopped.org/extend/premium-upgrades/
http://getshopped.org/forums/topic.php?id=14896


Anyway it seems that some of the plugin vendors are offering GPL, but as many (maybe more?) are bypassing the GPL and it seems they are being successful. Is it that the community respect is really unimportant to the majority of potential customers?

These are honest questions. I know for some reason they annoy some people on the list, but the requests for clarity which is a great thing can be annoying.  

Based on these examples it seems that maybe businessman who doesn't really care about the ethos of the GPL and who don't worry about the good graces of the core community can easily run a plugin business that bypasses the GPL by appealing to the masses who pay no attention to the politics of the GPL?

I'd actually love to hear what those who are not supporting the GPL have to say about it, and I'm also curious why Matt hasn't publicly campaigned against them like he campaigned against Thesis?

I misspoke: I should have said "many of those you mention have not chosen a GPL license...", not "most."

Most are.
iThemes, Gravity Forms, All in One SEO Pack - Pro, Shopp, and Getshopped are
all definitely GPL.
BTW, if it isn't explicitly stated that it's a different (GPL-compatible)
license, it is GPL by default.
Also, both versions of All in One SEO Pack explicitly are GPL.

As applied to what?  All plugins?  Or something else?

If the former, I have at least one attorney who is one of the leading intellectual property attorneys in Atlanta who has given me his opinion otherwise. FWIW.

BTW, don't shoot the messenger; I'm not advocating for or against GPL.  I'm only advocating for fact-based clarity.

Which, the attorney?

He wrote a paper on it but after Thesis settled I suggested he hold it until the issue came up significantly in the community consciousness again so he could get it published somewhere that is widely read.

And just to be clear, I don't care which direction is true, but I think the current situation has too little clarity.  If it's a license issue, then let's get the facts right.  If it's really a community culture issue and not really a license issue then, let's say so and not imply that it is a license issue.  I'm again not personally taking a stand on where it sits, I just don't like the lack of clarity.

Much like US politics today.  (Or since before the real Tea Party, for that matter.)

These are honest questions. I know for some reason they annoy some people on the list, but the requests for clarity which is a great thing can be annoying.  
----

Thank you. You put it much better than me!

----
Based on these examples it seems that maybe businessman who doesn't really care about the ethos of the GPL and who don't worry about the good graces of the core community can easily run a plugin business that bypasses the GPL by appealing to the masses who pay no attention to the politics of the GPL?
----

Can we not do both? I for one rate the community approval very high in my priorities. However I would also like to be a good businessman! 

----
I'd actually love to hear what those who are not supporting the GPL have to say about it, and I'm also curious why Matt hasn't publicly campaigned against them like he campaigned against Thesis?
----

Someone earlier said that that taking a stance on premium plugins is not matts concern (words to that effect) and i believe they are right. however i agree that a stance on whether plugins have to be gpl or not would be very interesting. 
I am not against the gpl however thinking about this topic has given me an insight (of sorts) to those who are 'against' it. If i were to circumnavigate the gpl (not saying i will....) i would be doing it in order to protect the product in order to maximise profit. The more control i have over the code (and the less control developers have) the more money can be made. I am not condoning this but i am also not arguing against it. It is no doubt against the ethos of open source and therefor the community but it is also good business sense...... Again, it would be good if we could do both...... Maybe people already do? Maybe the issue of non gpl plugins is null? Maybe plugins can be both gpl compliant and potentially profitable long term?

Ditto!

I'm quite certain they could.  I've no doubt.  Just as 3rd party sites 
exist that distribute all the products we've mentioned for less than the 
rates charged by their developers, there are music distribution 
companies that don't care to respect the artists and globally distribute 
their music. I may have once heard of a video company that seems to pay 
drunk girls to climb into their bus and go wild on camera.  There are 
lots of ways you can make money without benefit to or respect for 
others.  Lots of people proudly proclaim they don't care at all about 
what others think about them and what they do.  This is demonstrated in 
their actions, word and businesses.  A good many people who have this 
world view appear to make pretty good money.  I generally try my best to 
make sure that none of that money comes from me.

I'm not a GPL militant. I leave that to others, though if there are 
clear license violations that's a nonstarter for me.  Respect, attitude 
and personality do matter to me.   I show that in where I lend my verbal 
and/or monetary support.  My answers to what are the "best and most 
appropriate way[s]" to approach theme and plugin development are going 
to reflect this.

I think good businessmen can honor the GPL.  My personal opinion is that it is a harder business model to implement then a proprietary business model because the GPL license limits your flexibility in what you can and cannot do.  Some people can manage it brilliantly, other's cannot.  

I frankly think it comes down it part to whether you are a staunch believer in the GPL or see it as a burden.  I think the former will have a better chance at success then the latter.  Matt has done brilliantly with it and arguably so has Brian of StudioPress (though I won't if he'll ever be able to sell StudioPress for F*ck-you money[1].) 

What I don't see is nearly as many viable companies offering GPL plugins and/or GPL themes as in the 1990's when I ran a catalog mail order company selling VBX controls to Visual Basic developers. In those days there were well over 500 identifiable commercial vendors with enough revenue stream to advertise (since we sold them advertising, we knew!) and I dare say that there are more WordPress users (~13 millions sites) then there were Visual Basic developers at the time (~1 million.)

> Someone earlier said that that taking a stance on premium plugins is not Matt's concern (words to that effect) and i believe they are right.

Which is probably true but if it is true I'm really curious as to why Thesis' lack of GPL became such a big campaign for him (just google "thesiswp" to read more than you'll ever want to know about it.)

> If i were to circumnavigate the gpl (not saying i will....) i would be doing it in order to protect the product in order to maximise profit. The more control i have over the code (and the less control developers have) the more money can be made.

I don't think that is a foregone conclusion, at least not in the WordPress space.  Many would argue, including me that there is a huge "karma" benefit to being GPL especially (IMO) if you architecture your plugins to themselves be extensible with hooks and cultivate 3rd party add-ins.  But just how much value that "karma" adds is impossible to quantify because every example for study executes differently.  

Caveat Emptor.

Karma. It's funny you say that because I've just listened to the full discussion matt had with Chris over thesis. Here's matts closing statement -

Matt: I think that the facts basically come down to three basic things. One, going GPL is the right thing to do. You don?t want to be at odds with the platform that your entire business is built on. Like I said, WordPress is a very large community. That?s apparently why he chose it as opposed to a different platform. However, when you chose software, you abide by its license just like you would want people who use Theis to abide by its license. Second, I believe it is the legal thing to do. Some of the best legal minds have looked at this issue, at WordPress, and at Thesis and have decided. Three, I just think it is good businesses. Many other businesses made the switch. You have direct analogs to what Chris could do here. In addition, back to the first point, you want to be aligned with the platform you built on. In summation, those are the three things I believe. Again, thank you Andrew for bringing together this special.

"the right thing to do". Karma. Ethos. All have the same implications. And i agree. You are right. Wordpress is a community and there is something different about it. 

This started because i was asking for ways to protect my code. Which is actually ludicrous. Let me explain.... I have built on wordpress because i believe in it as a platform, believe it offers value to users and developers and because it was built by people like me! Well.... People who I'd like to be like in a few years anyway! Wordpress is distributed under the gpl. I don't care about the legalities of it all. If nothing else Matt has asked that ALL plugins, themes be distributed under the same license. It's the "right thing to do" to abide by that request. What i am building is totally dependant on wordpress. Sure i could develop a stand alone php platform but how long would that take me? Wordpress has been built and developed governed by what is needed and users and developers feel is best. I can not replicate that. So asking how to protect my code is ludicrous because if the developers of wordpress had done the same i wouldn't be developing the plugin at all! 

Listening to the discussion between matt and Chris was very very helpful in deciding my stance on this topic. It's not about legalities. It's about what's right. 

End of sermon. ;-)

Thanks. 

Andy

Subject: [wp-hackers] ZIP file archive API
Message-ID: <4C19F045-FF62-4543-B512-41523A013D0D@gmail.com>

I'm working on a plugin that downloads third party product data in XML format from an external website. 

The file that is downloaded is a compressed ZIP file format and temporarily stored in a sub-directory just under the Plugin's root directory. 

So the first thing I'm curious about is how to best utilize the WP_http API class for downloading that file into the sub directory. The second thing is how to extract the xml file stored inside the zip archive while minimizing web server restrictions and errors. 

So my question is this.... Does Wordpress already have a built-in class for handling zip archives? 

It would be a pleasant surprise to find out if Wordpress already has something like the WP_http API, but for zip archives to handle all of logic involved with server configurations, zipping & unzipping files, and other file compression functions.

Any suggestions or info would be great. 

Thanks.

Yes, it does. That's how automatic updates are performed: a zip file is
downloaded and then extracted on the server.

That's what I was thinking.

I know I can poke around in the code... but would you happen to know anymore
about how wordpress handles the automatic updates, what classes it uses,
function names, program flow, or example usage perhaps?

Thanks again.

You'll want to look at WP_Filesystem. You'll find much of what you need in
wp-admin/includes/file.php, including the WP_Filesystem function,
request_filesystem_credentials(), unzip_file(), and download_url().

You'll also want to look at the WP_Upgrader class (and friends) and the
various WP_Filesystem_* classes. These can be found in wp-admin/includes.

Subject: [wp-hackers] exclude category from main loops via plugin
Message-ID: <4D06199C.2050208@gmail.com>

Hey there,
I am working on a plugin which needs to exclude a post category from 
main loops. E.g. the loop processed on the index page but as well from 
archives etc.
Normally I would use
<?php query_posts($query_string . '&category_name=-mycategory'); ?>
directly in the theme files.
How do I add it using hooks?
loop_start, parse_query or pre_get_posts?
I already tried adding it, but it just killed the website..

Thanks already!

Alexander, 
I already have a plugin which does this exact thing. Check out Simply Exclude http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simply-exclude/

Works for post categories, tags and authors. You can exclude these items from 4 specific is_* functions : is_front, is_archive, is_search, is_feed.

The process for doing the actual exclude is somewhat trivial. Documented on both the WP Codex page http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Queries (scroll to the Category Exclusion section) and my own Simply Exclude page http://www.codehooligans.com/projects/wordpress/simply-exclude/

Best, 
Paul

pre_get_posts is my preferred method. The hook fires before the
query executes, so there are no unnecessary database calls. The hook's first
argument is an object whose query_vars method is an array that you can add
your category exclusion (or any other query arguments) to.

Here's a sample:
function my_query( $query ) {
$query->query_vars[ 'category_name' ] = 'mycategory';
 return $query;
}
add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'my_query' );

works perfectly. only using id, but doesnt matter :) thanks!

function exclude_category($query) {
         $id= get_category_by_slug($options['mycategoryslug']);
         $query->query_vars['cat'] = -$id;
}
add_action('pre_get_posts', 'exclude_category');

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=H-NaLBg7==cn912w96CuN612SKN=WDJqE+LK=@mail.gmail.com>

My problem is not that the post_id isn't getting associated. The image
being uploaded *does* have the post_id associated with it. I've
confirmed by looking at the Media Library, and the image is associated
with the post of my custom post type.

There is obviously something else going on that is preventing the
image from being inserted into the WYSIWYG text area. I just need to
find the time to dig into the code of the media uploader to see what
criteria is looked at in order to show the *Insert into Post* button.

I just wanted to see if anyone knew if this was how things were
supposed to be or if it might possibly be a bug. Depending on what I
find after further research, I might submit a bug report.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Hooking into wp-cron settings?
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=Yg8FPa+toVz3Ac74gOsMf1w92Aj_eGdeprc21@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a hook that would allow one to modify settings in wp-cron.php?

I have an issue with scheduled posts not being published (yes, even in WP
3.#). One recommended fix is to change the wp-cron timeout from 0.01s to 5s.
I'm fine with modifying a core file for testing purposes, but if the change
resolves the problem, I'd prefer to have a more appropriate means of
implementing it.

I know there's the
cron_schedules<http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks/hook/cron_schedules>hook,
but that appears only to allow creation of cron jobs, not modification
of the settings in wp-cron itself.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

p.s. I know about the Missed
Scheduled<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/missed-schedule/>Plugin;
however, it simply takes over the entire publish_future_post
functionality.

Hi Chip,

You can add a filter on http_request_args and modify the timeout there
if doing cron. e.g. (completely untested)

function my_cron_http_request_args($r) {
     if (defined('DOING_CRON') && DOING_CRON) {
          $r['timeout'] = 5;
     }
     return $r;
}
add_filter('http_request_args', 'my_cron_http_request_args');

Hope this helps.

Thanks, Chris! I'll give that a try (and will also take a look at the docs
for http_request_args).

I thought that got fixed.

Looking through, I see that it did. While the timeout is 0.01, the
Curl and HTTP Extension methods apply a ceil to it, making it have a 1
second minimum on those calls.

You may want to check and see which http method your server is using.

You're trying to change the timeout for the spawn, not wp-cron, so
DOING_CRON won't be defined.

http_request_args passes a second arg, $url. You'll want to set timeout to 5
when $url = get_option('siteurl') . '/wp-cron.php'.

I wouldn't call that a recommended fix. Five seconds is a long time to wait
for the user who gets caught with that. 0.01 should work under any transport
we support currently (exception, WP 2.9.0, fixed in WP 2.9.1), though I'd
either use the alternate cron, or by firing wp-cron at the system level.

get_option( 'siteurl' ) => would site_url() work/not work/be more
appropriate?

Right now, it would be a temporary fix. Clearly, something is interfering
with the cron job firing/completing, and I need to figure out what it is.
I'm still looking into that (though I've seen some forum posts that suggest
that certain Plugins, including caching Plugins, may somehow be
contributing).

Care to point me in the right direction for learning how to use the
alternate cron and firign wp-cron at the system level?

Thanks!

define('ALTERNATE_WP_CRON',true); in wp-config will enable the
alternate cron method.

If you're only providing that as your "source". If you're distributing
the PHP as obfuscated/encrypted and make the GPL'd source available
via other distribution means, then no, it isn't a violation.

I've been searching in the meantime, and found your original forum
reply<http://wordpress.org/support/topic/296236#post-1175405>
.

Perhaps an obvious question: is there any way to debug the problem is a
server configuration issue, that would require using the alternate cron
method?

I need to allow for users to edit a published post, without taking that 
page down after the edit, or having those edits apply immediately - 
edits need to be approved by an editor, admin, or some new moderator role.

What would be the value/purpose of distributing obfuscated/encrypted systems
if you also have the unobfuscated versions available?  Yes, so long as the
readable version are available you aren't violating GPL, but you're wasting
a lot of time "protecting" code that you've also made freely available.

One reason I can think of to obfuscate/encrypt GPL'd code would be in
conjunction with a support agreement to reduce the chances that you are
supporting a modified plugin.

Have you looked at the Revisionary plugin[1]? I've not tried it myself, but
the functionality sounds like what you're after.

"Freely available" != sitting unprotected on an FTP site somewhere.
See the "Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution and
Modification" section 1, or even the preamble. You're conflating beer
and speech (a common error, no doubt).

Isn't that an excellent reply?  I saved it for posterity on The Code 
Cave last week (giving full credit) and added my own comments afterward.

Here are my additions:

I would add three things to this explanation:

    * mod_security can be configured to block the ip address of the
      server, the domain name itself or even wp-cron specifically.  You
      can do some testing of this by doing a wget for your domain from
      your server. (wget http://example.com/wp-cron.php) and look at the
      results.  If there's a problem and you can't change the
      mod_security config itself, the fix may be configuring .htaccess
      to specifically allow
      <http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-cron-is-having-mod_security-error-500>
      from your server's external IP address access to that file.
    * The loopback address failure can be caused by the Linux networking
      subsystem failing to load completely. Diagnosing that is off topic
      here, but you could look for it and see if you can "ping
      127.0.0.1" and your domain from your server. If that works,
      loopback config isn't the problem. If you it doesn't, try running
      "ifconfig lo up" and doing it again. If it works, you've got some
      networking issues to resolve. If once device fails due to a config
      error, the rest don't come up in systems I've seen.
    * It has been reported and disputed
      <http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8923> that the line in
      cron.php that calls the script has  a timeout that is too short or
      a value that is incompatible with some configurations. I also
      suspect that this can be a problem on extremely overloaded
      systems.  However, the fix might be worse than the original symptom.

The line in question is:

    wp_remote_post($cron_url, array('timeout' => 0.01, 'blocking' =>
    false));

Some people have changed 0.01 to 1 and it works however, this adds a 
full second to every page load that calls wp-cron - and that could be 
very costly Google wise.  So be conservative  using this "fix". On your 
overloaded system, adding milliseconds or second or more might not be 
noticeable, but then again - you probably have more pressing things you 
should be worrying about than a few missed posts.

That's exactly what the plugin I pointed to does.

look at revision controlling meta data. There was a thread on this mailing

No, I'm not.

For a system to be compliant with the GPL (whether it's a paid system or a
free system) you must provide the system's source code in "the preferred
form of the work for making modifications to it."

So, if I buy a premium plug-in for you that contains obfuscated code, you
are still required to provide me with the unobfuscated code upon my request
of it.  Since we're working under the terms of the GPL, I have the right to
modify, add to, remove from, and redistribute this code.

So what then is the value/purpose of selling me a piece of obfuscated code
when you are still required to provide me with the unobfuscated code as
well?

More modern versions of WP fix this. Basically, wp_remote_post has one
of five different ways to do its job, depending on the capabilities of
the particular server installation. Two of those have problems with
sub-second timeout values, so those two use the PHP ceil function to
force the timeout up to 1 second.

So this should not be an issue with any recent version of WordPress.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Changing wordpress.org Passwords
Message-ID: <AANLkTimWpvh=MTTayDb6eCS=XaJrvpc3LqW-gZv0av7A@mail.gmail.com>

I just had a friend as me how he should change his wordpress.org
password, because it was compromised as part of the Gawker hacking[1]

I assumed he was being lazy, but checked anyway -- it's surprisingly
difficult/inconsistent to do anything user-account related with
wordpress.org (the website) users.

Currently there are 4 different experiences (at least):

1. http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ --> once logged in, click your
name and goes to e.g.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/profile/beaulebens

2. http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/ --> doesn't carry cookie over
from /plugins/. once you log in again, clicking your username (doesn't
show your display name like /plugins/ does) goes to
http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/profile/beaulebens (different
profile page)

3. http://wordpress.org/support/ --> shows your display name + a link
to "View your profile". Clicking that link goes to
http://wordpress.org/support/profile/beaulebens (*another* different
profile page). From here there's actually a link ("Edit") that allows
you to change your password. That's the only one I could find.

4. Check out a plugin (e.g.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wickett-twitter-widget/) and click
one of the author links; goes to http://profiles.wordpress.org, which
doesn't allow you to modify your password anywhere that I can find.

http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/beaulebens/ seems to be the most
full-featured profile system currently. It shows plugins, themes and
forum contributions, in addition to Trac mentions. My suggestion would
be to include the ability to modify your password there, then change
all links (/support/, /plugins/ and /themes/) to point over to that
profile page.

Don?t try to store files there. Use the upload directory. Any other

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom content question
Message-ID: <017101cb9b12$dfc99dc0$9f5cd940$@com>

Hi guys,

 

I am working on a relatively small site that will have Presentations and
Presenters (in addition to standard Posts and Pages).  On the presentation
screens, we want to list the related Presenters (and have them link to the
Presenter detail page) and vice versa.

 

Ideally, we would use Custom Post Types to achieve this (and that seems like
what the WP community would suggest).  It seems like everything has to be a
taxonomy to make that work instead of allowing me to just select the related
presenters on the Presentation admin screen.  

 

Is there an easy way to set up WordPress to manage these Content Types?

 

Presentations have:

.         Title

.         Date / Time

.         Image(s)

.         Description

.         Registration URL

.         Presenters (ideally a drop-down list)

 

Presenters have:

.         Name

.         Title

.         Image(s)

.         Bio

.         Associated Presentations (ideally a drop-down list)

 

Any help much appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Adam

Yep, I'm digging into this - we already got the metadata versioning 
worked out (from the other thread). This plugin contains a missing 
feature where it doesn't show the metadata panels associated with a 
custom post type, in the custom edit page it added to WordPress for 
published content. I'll get a patch together at least for that - but it 
does work with the metadata off the shelf. This plugin is pretty sweet. :-)

I would do each one different.  I would set up Presentations as a custom
post type and Presenters as a custom taxonomy.

Just like categories and tags, taxonomy items (presenters) can have
additional information assigned to them.  You can then easily set up an
archive for this taxonomy along the lines of
http://site.url/presenter/adam-polon that will list your name, title, bio,
and all of the presentations (custom post type) that belong to that
presenter.

Then set up a custom post type for presentations and build the additional
fields as custom meta boxes.  You can select one or more presenters as well
to automatically associate things.

Message-ID: <sig.2963f458dd.271A8D94-F2D1-4F2D-96DC-75941D2F192B@birdhouse.org>

I'm helping an editor from a semi-prominent site  find and hire a  
consultant who can help get to the bottom of - and permanently solve -  
ongoing mysterious performance issues.

We're looking for someone with solid mysql and server tuning  
experience, who knows how to inspect network packets, and who knows WP  
inside out (i.e. we're not just looking for an average dev who can  
install TotalCache :)  The candidate should be able to determine  
whether the outages are:

- Caused by normal performance problems
- Can be solved with database tuning
- Result from a particular plugin or combination of plugins
- Related to unusual network traffic (attacks of some kind)

... and who can implement fixes or make recommendations.  Since the  
outages are intermittent, the job will probably involve someone being  
on call or on a monitoring system for a while, and available to jump  
in when an outage occurs. Consultant will need to accurately describe  
the diagnosis and fix (we want to learn from this process).

If interested, please send me (off-list) your CV or credentials,  
related URLs, references to similar work you've done in the past, and  
your rate.

Thanks,
Scot

The Studio I work for has purchased GPL plugins.

We can redistribute the code... but we don't. We can even get the
plugins for free somewhere else... but we don't.

We paid the fee for the easy updates and support, plain and simple.
And we don't distribute because we don't want to offer support for
them ourselves.

Just in case you wanted a customer point of view. The business that
sell these plugins do so from a server that requires an API key, but
that's more along the lines of Locks on doors keep honest people
honest. Their terms (which we found important) are for the easy
auto-updates (and also receiving code "from the source") and support
while the plugin php code itself is available through the GPL (for
free... as in beer). The plugins (and support) we purchased are well
worth what we paid.

Ahhh, gotcha. The value/purpose is a simple one (though please don't
hear me as agreeing with the premise): since you only have to offer
access to the source code when asked ("make available") and you assume
that the vast majority of your potential users don't actually care
about having access to the code from a Freedom perspective, as long as
you're only distributing encrypted/obfuscated code, your potential
exposure to code/IP "theft" goes down concomitantly.

Of course, you'd be better off basing such an endeavor on a platform
that doesn't require a GPL license, but then, hey, I'm not saying the
decision is a good one, just that it's a decision.

So the API key give you updates from the server, or something else?
Also, is there a reason you didn't name the plugins?

Just curious, on both accounts.

That's not at all how that was intended in GPL. You can view PHP code when
you download the software, but obviously this isn't the case for compiled
code written in other languages. That's what the license is referring to. I
write x software for you in Clarion, license it as GPL, distribute it, but
you don't automatically have the source code since it's compiled. However,
if it's GPL, you can ask me for the source code.
This wasn't intended as a way for you to try and limit access to your
source. That completely goes against what the license (and open source in
general) is trying to do.
Stop trying to make open source adapt to you.

I'd think that encrypted/obfuscated code would provoke someone to
request the readable code, then post it (legally, if it's GPL) on
their blog, thus increasing your "potential [negative] exposure" ...
just as a practical consideration, it makes better sense to charge for
support and encourage more positive forms of exposure.

Once again, don't hear me as arguing for the practice -- I'm against
it in both principle and in practice. However, what I AM saying is
that the GPLv2 allows for such a [mis]use of the "make available"
clause and, if you feel like your business is worth taking a
reputation hit, you can press ahead with that sort of scheme.

Not trying to get Chip-Bennett-licensing-literal on the whole thing
here, but you CAN do what has been suggested. That's not to say it's
wise, nice, or in the "spirit" of the GPL.

I certainly hope you're not hearing  me as advocating for this
approach. I'm arguing, rather, that it is possible to do so.

...And the whole point of open source software IS to allow me to adapt
it to me. I can take the software, modify the ever-loving heck out of
it and never redistribute a single byte and still be in compliance
with the license. It's only when I go to make a business out of it (or
even just start giving away the end product) that the GPL comes into
effect.

What is your point exactly? Yes, obviously that's in the letter of the
license, but clearly isn't the intention.
If you're entering open source development and trying to figure out ways to
make your code not open, you're missing the point, and open source
development likely isn't for you.

Oh, I was referring to GravityForms and BackupBuddy. (GravityForms has
the better system: just a key, while BackupBuddy uses user/pass
combo). The API (or user/pass) grants you access to automatic updates
from their server. I've never requested the source code directly under
GPL explicitly, so I don't know how they'd respond, but I'm assuming
they'd just give it under the terms of the GPL. Their terms were
explicit about the code being GPL and that the purchase was
specifically for support and updates (automatic from their server).
Didn't mean to hide anything, just didn't think that naming them added
anything either.

No. Go back and reread what I wrote. I said nothing about modifying code.

I hear you Doug (nice Chip-Bennett reference! Chip's a nice guy, btw ;-)

Yeah, I guess the model I mentioned (GravityFroms and BackupBuddy)
play on what you say: Support includes "Easier" access via automatic
updates, while the GPL only requires source delivery on request.

I didn't take you as advocating for obfuscation, I was simply offering
an explaination why it'd be bad in practice. :-)

Ah yes, thanks. I'm a GF user too.

I haven't seen the value in BackupBuddy yet since I get more control of the 3 of 4 listed features with FTP and Navicat, and a repository plugin handles the forth.  
Still, I should probably just buy a personal version so I can see it myself; maybe there is something more to it I don't see?  I probably will...

I'd recommend creating each as a custom post type, then using Posts 2 Posts
( http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/posts-to-posts/ ) to link them.

I built something similar for a client when needed, and later found the
plugin: http://www.billerickson.net/wordpress-post-type-linking/

I'm with Eric on this, the natural way to do this is have the custom
post type (presentation) with a custom taxonomy (presenter). You get
so much functionality 'for free' when you use this simple built-in
method.

It really depends how you conceptualize your content. In my mind, a post is
a unit of content, a post type is a type of content, and a taxonomy is a
logical grouping of posts.

A presenter should be a post because it will have a full description (post)
and possibly more information (post meta). A presenter isn't simply a
grouping of posts. An appropriate taxonomy for presentation might be topic.

I really think this is a feature that we should see in core, but until then
I think you should use plugins / custom code rather than hack it with
taxonomies. You should have the ability to link two pieces of content
(posts) without using a taxonomy.

For a full discussion see: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14513

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP e-Commerce + GPL + Protecting Plugins...
Message-ID: <4D06DBD6.4010903@instinct.co.nz>

Hey Guys,

Because of Brian's comments I changed the wording on our site. It now says less about the licensing and more about what you get when you make a purchase.

-- WP e-Commerce and the GPL --

WP e-Commerce is GPL and unlike some other e-Commerce Plugins it is actually listed in WordPress Extend and free to use.

We were not always GPL though. When we launched we didnt know anything about the GPL, licenses, or anything like that... we just knew we liked WordPress and we wanted to contribute back. We were just like everybody else on this email list who didnt know about the GPL until they took the time to learn about it. It took some time for us to make the leap of faith, the reasons we didn't do it sooner were fear based, we were scared that it would somehow have a negative impact on our business.

Anyway as time went on we kept being told that we should use the GPL, especially as we were a WordPress Plugin, and in 2008 at the Sydney WordCamp I announced that we were going fully GPL.

Going GPL did not have a negative impact, it was one of the best things we ever did. Our community has grown and our Plugin is getting better and better all the time. The pending 3.8 release is half the file size of previous 3.7 released and it consumes a hell of a lot less memory. We put a lot of these benefits down to moving products and product categories over to Custom Post Types and Taxonomies.. and generally using WordPress code to do more and more things.

Bear in mind though that we did hacks out of necessity. I remember being attacked for not using the WP media manager before there were the hooks & filters in place to do it. It was a crazy time. We "had" to write our own hacks back in the day - can you imagine a shop with no images?

-- painting the bike shed --

To be honest what frustrates me the most about this conversation and the many others like it, is that absolutely everything here, the essence of this whole conversation, has already been said before in a multitude of different languages, by a multitude of different people, from a multitude of different countries over and over again... it seems like a gross waste of time / information.

Actually we've got enough here to nail this subject once and for it.

-- my point --

The big problem here from my point of view is that there is no official stance or guides on this from WP on the wordpress.org website. And it "does" need to be on the wp.org website for this type of conversation to go away - otherwise its just hearsay.

It is all very well that some of the key WP influencers out there have made "comments" on their blogs about this subject but I have a feeling that this conversation is not going away until somebody makes an official stance. It will just keep getting repeated. Once there is an official stance we cant just point people to a link... and its all good. Man hours saved = more beer o'clock.

So in Open Source Spirit I am going to start fleshing something out over the holidays. I think I have a fairly good understanding of how this whole freemium model works, I have an ok understanding of what is allowed and what isnt. And there are other people out there on this list that also seem to have their finger on the pulse, so I'll start asking around and see what I can come up with.

If people have any feedback or would like to help write something official please flick me an email - that would be cool!!!

-- end --

Ciao,
Dan

p.s. the gold cart plugin itself has gpl license.txt in it

I've just found the root of this problem. When you upload an image (or
select one from your media library) the "Insert Into Post" button is
only displayed if the post type supports 'editor'. The conditional in
question can be found on line 1166 of /wp-admin/includes/media.php.

It looks like there isn't a filter available anywhere to change this
behaviour, but I'm hunting for one now as I have the same problem as
you Becky.

Message-ID: <AANLkTiksY2vxMVGf_8JCOc5WiBj182m8W1N00njd77GC@mail.gmail.com>

I am unable to get media library items to come across in an export/import
process with WP 3.0.1 multi-site. I noticed that the 'attachment' post_type
has 'can_export' set to false in post.php. Is there a reason for that?

It seems to break the whole process of exporting and importing posts with
any kind of media attached to them. When I change 'can_export' to 'true', it
works as I would expect it to.

Is this a bug, or is there an alternative way to get media attachments to
export?

Thanks for your help,

Anything wrong with using authors as presenters? Will they ever cross  
over from presenters to post authors? Name, bio, image, etc. and  
associated content is already handled by the authors function.

Media attachments have always worked fine in my experience. There are  
some serious problems with the exporter and importer in 3.0, though,  
so this might be one of the bugs. Are you  checking the XML file  
produced for attachments, or just checking what comes in on import? If  
it's the latter, make sure you have import attachments checked on  
import.

That should be the only one you find. It's the correct and only place
to change your wp.org password.


Yes, I know the profile system is inconsistent and weird. Lots of
stuff to work on there. A lot of this is due to differing versions of
bbPress on themes and plugins. Upgrading these is difficult since
there's so much custom code there.

Just a data point to consider.

Obfuscating your source code makes other developers hate you, badmouth
you, and send as much negative press your way as possible. Why?
Because you have made them look bad.

Friend of mine called me up a few months ago. Said her boss was having
problems with a WordPress installation (big local blog). I wandered
down to their offices, met with them, found out what the problem was,
sat down at her desk... and got totally screwed over because the (paid
for) theme used frickin' encryption on the functions.php file. All
they wanted was some relatively minor changes, but because of the
encryption (good hard stuff too, not easy to decode), there was
basically nothing I could do. I had to make my apologies as best I
could. Then I immediately got on Twitter and badmouthed the hell out
of the theme creators.

Consider your users and what's best for them. What's *really* best for
them is not having to come to you for every single little problem. If
they can learn something and solve issues themselves, then you should
let them do so. What are you selling here, after all? Lock in?

People who obfuscate or otherwise make their code hard for their users
to use are scum. Period.

Okay I've just written some code which gets around this problem,
albeit in a bit of a bizarre way.

http://pastebin.com/hxnjJC1z

Basically the function plugin_foo_insert_button_hack() is called when
you upload a file, and at the top of the media browser. It checks the
current post's post type for support for 'my_plugin_feature' and adds
support for 'editor' in order to force the 'Insert Into Post' button
to show up. It's wholly inelegant but it works and that's all I need
at this moment in time, so it'll have to do.

You'll probably need to tweak this to apply to your own
plugin/situation, but hopefully this will be of help to someone else.

I'll open a bug report in due course but I think the whole media
management system is due an overhaul shortly (3.2?) so it might end up
being a moot issue.

I agree I have ran into themes that do that with the footer, in an effort to
force you to keep their links, so when they do that I will rebuild the
footer html myself then remove their links just to spite them lol, but hey
its GPL I can do that.  Whereas if they would have left the footer as just
plain code, I would have either just kept the links or make a donation to
the developer before removing if I really didn't want the links but liked
the template.

And they're on to that tactic now, too. A lot of these bastards are now
putting in checksums and other code-checks in header.php (and functions.php,
and elsewhere) to check for changes to the encrypted footer.php code - and
die() if it's been changed.

(Not that such checks are anything more than an annoyance, since they, too,
can be cleaned up and removed.)

Pardon my French - but what the fuck? What a ridiculous (and in vain)
effort to go to, just to try to keep people from removing your links.
*shakes head in disbelief*.

Just to be a pedantic ass... it's open source, that's why you can do it,
not because it's GPL :).

It could be BSD license, or Apache, or PHP, or MIT.. and you could still
do it... technically speaking of course.

Do a Google search for "Free WordPress Themes" and just take a gander at the
sites that come up. You'll run into all kinds of this crap.

not to start an argument but that's not entirely true, it depends on how you
look at open source.  If you look at open source as a program licensed with
freedoms to modify the code freely than yes, if you look at open source as a
program where the source is available (ie not closed source) then not
necessarily.

Look at Creative Commons, it requires you to keep such links, the
attribution requirement, though depending on what licensed is chosen you can
still be able to otherwise modify the work, or even distribute it or
derivative works.  Now some could argue that CC doesn't constitute open
source, but again it comes back to the definition used.

Actually, the CC-Attribution license is horribly abused - especially by
shady Theme distributors.

The Attribution clause only requires that the work retain a link to the
original author's work and/or copyright/license notice. It DOES NOT REQUIRE
that said link be *public-facing*. Further, the CC-Attribution clause itself
actually says that requirements to display any other "attribution" link not
directly related to the original author's copyright/license notice can be
ignored.

I am checking the exported .xml file.?The post_type='attachment' are
simply not coming through because 'can_export' = false.

Is there a way around this other than manually setting
'can_export'=true in the core code?

That's how core calls wp_remote_post in spawn_cron(). I haven't a clue. I
believe SSL verification occurs deeper in HTTP though.

Possibly, but not anymore. I believe the diff should have been applied to
nav menu items, not attachments.

That said, can_export only affected the UI in 3.0. Attachments that have a
post or a page as a parent do work as before. Attachments without a parent
should also be included in the export -- can_export has no effect on the
export file creation.

Jon (duck_) can probably go into more detail on the changes in 3.1, but
you'll want to look at http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15197. A good
amount of this has changed in trunk, to say the least.

Agreed.  I would say it is more common than not on many of the "free" 
theme sites out there.  That's why I tell people to go with themes from 
WordPress.org and established theme vendors.

& obfuscating the whole functions.php?  That's just wrong and would piss 
me off too.  I was upset enough  the other day that I had to undo a 
bunch of work and testing on a server build because I belatedly found 
binary php files in two areas in the main site paying for it.  The site 
had two products obfuscated with different methods. One I got working 
after installing the tool they used, the other one required me to scrap 
APC (& reconfig W3TC) and rebuild php with the Zend Optimizer so Zend 
Guard could work.  These weren't WordPress plugins, so the GPL didn't 
enter into it. It was just really annoying.

Message-ID: <35B3118A-AA6C-4538-A0AE-EE9BEC238FBC@bigfish.co.uk>

Hi guys,

Does anyone know of a method to modify the posts displayed on the edit posts screen, either through the query string or programmatically?

Essentially, I want to display an admin screen, identical to the regular `wp-admin/edit.php`, of posts that have a certain meta value.

In WP 3.0, I used the (possibly hacky) method of creating an admin page in which I queried the posts I wanted, then faked the global `$current_screen` object to match the one in `wp-admin/edit.php`, and then simply included `wp-admin/edit-post-rows.php`. This has unfortunately stopped working in WP 3.1, though ? as perhaps such a bodged solution was always destined to to!

So, is there a better method? My initial hope before I used the hacky solution was just that I could pass query vars into the URL directly (i.e. that I could just link to `wp-admin/edit.php?meta_key=foo&meta_value=bar`), but that doesn't seem to be possible. Google doesn't turn up anything, but I might just be failing at search terms. Does anyone have any ideas?

I thought about filtering `the_request` and only modifying the request on certain admin pages, but it seemed overly general and unnecessary ? perhaps it's the only solution, though.

Thanks,
Rob

Can you clarify how you want to modify them?  Sort them, filter them, display them as pig-latin, or something else?

To edit which posts appear there ? either on a new page, or on the regular `wp-admin/edit.php` page if certain values are present in the query string.

I want, essentially, to be able to link users of a plugin to an admin page that displays all posts that have a certain meta key set to a certain value.

These two answer are not exactly what you are asking but probably close enough for you to grok it:

Hmm, looks like I'll have to just modify `parse_query`/`the_request` and do some checking for if I'm on the right page, then. I figured there might be a simpler way (like some sort of `edit_posts_query` filter, perhaps) but I guess there can't be filters *everywhere* :)

Thanks,

It's really easy to add filters and inputs to the Posts screen. I just
wrote this small plugin which gives you a dropdown of all available
meta keys and a text input so you can search for a corresponding
value. Try it out:

Andrew,

I forgot to mention that because of shortcomings in the 3.0.1 exporter
in regards to custom taxonomies, I am running off trunk for the two
export.php files (with the exception of a recent commit that included
some javascript stuff for the UI when selecting between radio buttons,
and the submit_button() function, which does not exist in 3.0.1).

In trunk, line 50 of wp-admin/includes/export.php grabs only
post_types where can_export=true. Without wanting to change core code,
I managed to create a simple plugin that hooks 'init' with a priority
of 1 and resets can_export to true for post_type='attachment'.

With this plugin in place it seems to be working now for me, but
ultimately, I think it may be a bug in 3.1.

John -

Thank you *so* much for figuring that out and posting your solution. I
was digging around in the code yesterday but couldn't find the right
spot that rendered that button. I had some other client stuff to work
on, so I moved on.

I tried out your code on my local install, and it appears to work just
fine. I need to do more testing of course, but so far so good. I did
notice that I had to click the 'Save Changes' button after the image
was uploaded and then go to the gallery or library in order to have
the *Insert into Post* button available, but that's something I think
I can deal with.

Thank you for opening a bug report on this topic. Could you possible
provide the link to that? I'd like to keep track of things.

Thanks again for figuring out a workaround. And I'm glad to know I'm
not the only one who encountered this issue.

Becky

Trunk has the correct settings for can_export when registering the
default post types. So that is what you're missing out on when only
updating the export.php files.

Open Source != GPL and that's important to remember.

GPL'd code requires that the original source be made available to all
recipients in "the preferred form of the work for making modifications to
it."  I've quoted this before, but perhaps you've missed it.  So let me say
this as clearly as possible: *obfuscated/encrypted code is NOT the preferred
form of the work for making modifications to it!*
*
*
Code that is licensed under the terms of and compliant with the GPL must
have the non-obfuscated version available.  Themes being distributed by
organizations who refuse to respond to email, send support requests to a
black hole, and use obfuscated/encrypted code to install malware on your
site are *not following the terms of the license they're claiming gives them
the right to re-distribute these themes.  Any attempt to defend that
practice is, frankly, insulting to those of us who actually do follow the
GPL.*
*
*
*But you are right, you do have the right to remove this code under the GPL
and because the project is open source.  However, there are open source
licenses that allow for code modification and redistribution without requiring
that you make the non-obfuscated versions available.  The MIT is actually a
very good license in that situation because you can use it for JavaScript,
distribute only the minified version, and still use the code in GPL projects
(the MIT license is GPL compatible).*
*
*
*Please remember, though, that GPL'd software follows a much more
restrictive license and set of rules than generic "open source."  *

I belive the phrase your are using to say obfuscated/encrypted code
can't be GPL is just a defination of what they mean by "source code".
Also I see no reason within the GPL that obfuscated/encrypted code
can't be GPL'd by the original Copyright holder or by anyone modifying
it, as the source code has to be "machine-readable" not human
readable.

By decrypting it. Since it's got to be machine readable (modifications
& distrubitions only) it will have a decrypting method within the code
somewhere.

The terms and conditions only apply to "COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
MODIFICATION" and not to the ability to attach the license to code.
Simply put if I wanted to encrypt all my code and put it into a
seperate file and then run it thought mcrypt and eval there is no
valid reason that I can see I can't GPL that code. It would just be
silly.

The Free Software Foundation is very clear in their opinion that encrypted
or obfuscated source code is not source code.

That's not to say you can't ship encrypted, compressed, obfuscated, or
minified source code, only that you need to make the unencrypted,
uncompressed, unobfuscated, or unminified source available. Preferably in
the distribution, but that's not required.

Not doing so is just lame, frankly. :-)

Very cool, Dan.  You've always had my support and I've backed, and 
recommended wp-ecommerce for long time. It's helped earn me money on 
projects and put up some great stores very quickly. The pre-approved 
integration with the USPS saved me and others untold amounts of time.

I think this is an EXCELLENT idea.

The key word there is opinion, I just did a quick search for "GPL
Violations obfuscated code" to see if there has been a test case to
make this not just an opinion but fact. Again, the license doesn't
apply to the copyright holder therefore they can distribute the item
in any way they like.

I do agree tho that not having GPL code in open plain human readable
freely available code is lame.  I just don't agree with people saying
you can't GPL obfuscated code when there seems to be nothing within
the GPL itself that explictly says so and there seems to be no test
case stating so.

As the copyright holder, you can distribute code under whatever terms you
choose. However, in order to license code *validly* under GPL, you have to
make the human-readable code available. Otherwise, your code isn't really
GPLed.

Subject: [wp-hackers] MySQL's spatial data support and GeoData in wordpress
Message-ID: <4D07CE93.2010605@unFocus.com>

It looks like there are some older threads on the subject of how to best 
store geo location data, but MySQL's built in spatial column support 
didn't come up, so I thought I'd mention it as a possible standard for 
geo data storage.

http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/12147/working-with-spatial-data-in-mysql/
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/creating-spatial-columns.html

My SQL skills are rusty, but I think we can still use that support even 
with the current Meta data storage format suggested here 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata by using temp tables and/or 
subqueries (which if I remember correctly still use temp tables). I 
wonder if it'd be better to standardize on a static table, to avoid the 
overhead of the temp tables to gain efficient features like distance 
based sorting (if it's truly worth it to use spatial columns in MySQL - 
which I'm not even sure about).

Thoughts?

Correct but that's for a different reason. It's not obfuscated in
order to prevent the end user from modifying it or to prevent the user
from otherwise excercising their rights under the GPL, it was
obfuscated in order to make the easter egg a little harder for people
to notice when it was added to WordPress. This was done so it didn't
ruin the surprise.

The fact it doesn't comply with the GPL was just an oversight. It's
wholly different to obfuscating code in order to prevent end users
from modifying the code.

IMHO, "ruin the surprise" and professional-level software development are oxymoronic and should never be used in the same paragraph.

The egg is silly, stupid, and should never have been approved by the committers.

I've noticed that in_category(1) returns true for some pages (i.e.
About) both in WordPress 3.0.3 and 3.1-beta1-16884 with Twenty Ten
theme and no plugins.

For some other pages it returns false. I haven't figured out the
pattern yet. is_single() && in_category(1) works fine.

I supposed that it should only return true for posts in the specified
category. Is this a bug or intended behaviour?

Message-ID: <656690B9-53E6-4A86-95EF-B6303D98B709@gmail.com>

Hello

I am using scribu's custom field taxonomies plugin along with a custom extension he built for a client. I am trying to get a search form to search a custom field by default instead of when a checkbox is ticked. 
Ie
Currently the user has to tick a checkbox to search the 'img_count' field. That needs to be reversed. It should only show posts that do have a value in 'img_count' unless the user ticks the box.  

I suppose I could do it with a bit of JavaScript but I'd rather not!

Sorry if this is a bit vague! My head hurts after too long looking at the same thing!

Any ideas??

Thank you

Andy

It took you guys four days to jump from premium plugins, to GPL, to
obfuscated code, to the easter egg. You guys are slacking. Six months ago
you would have made those jumps in a day, tops.

Also, major props for having the most productive conversation on the list
for the last few months only days before the least productive conversation
on the list for the last few months. Surely one might have gotten the wrong
idea about wp-hackers after the version control thread, but you guys took
pains to set the record straight.

I subscribed to the list only a few days before the version control thread
got started, so I'm completely thrown off now, and have no idea what to
expect! Are you implying that not every thread on this mailing list is 100%
serious and productive? Who's ever heard of such a thing? Shocking!
Shocking, I say!

Subject: [wp-hackers] MySQL's spatial data support and GeoData in
	wordpress
In-Reply-To: <4D07CE93.2010605@unFocus.com>
References: <4D07CE93.2010605@unFocus.com>
Message-ID: <4D08016F.30704@unFocus.com>

My suggestion for a table structure, that might even be appropriate 
enough for core (if there are genuine advantages of the spacial column 
type) would be to model it after the postmeta table. This would allow 
for any general purpose GEOMETRY (the MySQL type) data to be stored in 
there by meta_key:

CREATE TABLE `wp_postgeo` (
   `geo_id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `post_id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
   `geo_key` varchar(255) default NULL,
   `geo_value` GEOMETRY,
   PRIMARY KEY (`geo_id`),
   KEY `geo_value` (`geo_value`(255)),
   KEY `post_id` (`post_id`),
   KEY `geo_key` (`geo_key`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM

Some notes;
  - I have no idea how big the index should be for KEY `geo_value` - I 
set it to 255, because I needed to set it to something to get MySQL to 
create the table.
  - I set the type to MyISAM becuase I the docs say that is the only 
engine that supports spatial indexes.)
  - The GEOMETRY column type actually allows for any of the other 
geometry based data formats to be stored within that column (most 
geocoding would be storing a POINT type for example): 
http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/4.1/gis-with-mysql.html

There may also be a case for a `wp_usergeo` table.

Reasons and intentions are not part of the code. Otherwise, I could claim  
the same reason to obfuscate my plugins.

/*
Plugin Name: Nonsense Premium
Description: Does some stuff. Mostly easter eggs
Version:     1.2

It?s hard to tell the difference for the end user, isn?t it? ;)

There were enough long discussions about the file; and I don?t want to  
open this can again. The problem I wanted to show is: There is a gray  
area. Some people write so badly formatted code that it is *nearly*  
obfuscated (nested ternaries anyone?). Others refer to "easter eggs".  
There may be more reasons.

The effect is the same. And that?s all that matters.

Hi,

I know WordPress 3.1 has removed the nofollow attribute from the
comment Reply link (WordPress 3.1 beta looks good), but was working on
something theme wise that should also work with removing the nofollow
attribute from the link for WordPress 3.0.3 and below, but can't get
it working.

Basically adding this code to the comments loop as a test works:

$comment->comment_content = str_replace('nofollow', 'Test
One',$comment->comment_content);

This removes the text nofollow from a comments body. This works as
expected. Going to try to use the concept to replace fully formed HTML
links from the body of comments and leave something like

http://www.domain.com : Anchor Text

This will remove the final WordPress nofollow links from my setup
without allowing follow links from comments. I digress, next step, not
there yet.

I tried

$comment_reply_link->reply_text  = str_replace('Reply', 'Test
Two',$comment_reply_link->reply_text );

As another test to replace the anchor text of the Reply link to
confirm I'm on the right track.

Didn't work.

and

$comment_reply_link->link  = str_replace('nofollow',
'',$comment_reply_link->link );

to delete the nofollow part of the rel attribute.

Didn't work either

Tried a variety of permutations with no joy.

Any ideas?

David

While you are certainly welcome to your opinion, you really don't get 
much of a say in what the committers should be approving unless you are 
actively contributing to the project. Become an active contributor (i.e. 
part of the product development team), and you'll be included in 
decisions like this. Just complaining about decisions that have already 
been made doesn't seem all that productive.

Just to go back to the original topic... ;-)
Presumably it is ok to have a plugin restrict the use of the plugin editor through the dashboard. To stop clients breaking it that is! 

And what if the client did not have access to the FTP of the site?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Limiting ability to add terms to taxonomies
Message-ID: <4BCBDC33-4C6D-4636-A874-71AA52533C0D@gmail.com>

I'd like to create a plugin that replaces the current meta boxes on  
the post edit page with a new meta box that restricts the ability to  
add terms to that taxonomy. The reason for this, if anyone was  
wondering, is because we use several custom taxonomies that are auto- 
linked in the articles but many people have access to edit the posts,  
so we need to make it a little harder to add a term so we don't end up  
with duplicate terms (such as President Barack Obama and Barack Obama).

My question is, is there an easy way to get an array of all the  
taxonomies that have meta boxes and unset those meta boxes?

Why not just do this?

remove_filter( 'pre_comment_content',  'wp_rel_nofollow', 15);

You might be over-thinking this. Can you not just use CSS to remove the "Add" link?

This will handle using CSS if you put in your theme's functions.php file (or in one of the .PHP files for a plugin of your own):

add_action('admin_head','yoursite_admin_head');
function yoursite_admin_head() {
   echo '<style type="text/css">#category-add-toggle {display:none;}</style>';
}

Hope this helps.

Hi,

When you define the post type...

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type

look at the 'supports' argument. "Revisions" is one of the values.

 $supports = array('title', 'editor', 'excerpt');

  register_post_type( 'my-type',
    array(
...
      'supports' => $supports
    )

I'm more worried about the ability to add terms to non-hierarchical  
taxonomies (such as post tags).

Can't reproduce. Pages don't have categories and therefore in_category(
$name_slug_or_id ) should always return false.

Please try the wp-testers list in the future.

If you can debug why this is happening, that'd be great.

Use the "add_meta_boxes" hook with a high priority (100?) and modify the global $wp_meta_boxes array?

Thanks for your response. Is there a way to find all the taxonomies  
that need to have their meta boxes unset? (For example, query all  
custom taxonomies with show_ui=true and hierarchical=false)

You'd be better off removing the permission which allows the current user
from editing the terms.
You can set a permission to be required to assign terms to a object, manage
them, delete them, and edit them.
See this code reference for it:

That's not helpful. 

A lot of my clients have never heard of FTP let alone have a use for it. I host them myself through hostgator. 

Would you mind answering my question?

Well, I want them to still be able to add terms, just have to go  
through the submenu in order to do so. Removing permissions for a user  
based on what page they're on seems a little inelegant.

What business would they have in using the plugin editor?

I would do this: create a new role for your clients and assign the
capabilities that make sense -- remove the ability to admin plugins,
etc. Use a capabilities manager plugin to do so.

Boom, done.

It's a good thing, then, that the words "professional-level software
development" are nowhere present in the paragraph you excerpted from, only
in your own reply to that email. :-)

You could either remove the metaboxes (see below -- though, it doesn't take
into account Quick Edit) or set show_ui to false by modifying the global
$wp_taxonomies object (though, this will likely have other side-effects).

$post_type = 'post';

 if ( ! is_taxonomy_hierarchical( $tax_name ) )

 remove_meta_box( 'tagsdiv-' . $tax_name, $post_type, 'side' );

 else

 remove_meta_box( $tax_name . 'div', $post_type, 'side' );

 }

}

Subject: [wp-hackers] Licensing and Copyright Issues with the Hello Dolly
	Plugin
Message-ID: <69933.78626.qm@web24107.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Please check the Hello Dolly plugin.

First, it does not specify it's license. So users who download[1] it 
do not know about it's license.

As it's written by Matt Mullenweg I _assume_ it's licensed under GPL. 
But I can not speak for Matt and I'm unsure if other users can do the 
same assumption on their own.

_If_ licensed under GPL, it needs to be checked again as it contains GPL 
in-compatible code[2] (documented by novasource) which terminates the 
GPL for the plugin. See 4. in GPL second version:

> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt 
> otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
> void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this 
> License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from 
> you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
> long as such parties remain in full compliance.

In the related ticket #15769[2] lead developer markjaquith wrote[3], 
the distribution of the code is intended for "non-commercial" and 
"educational" use.

If the use of the plugin is really limited to non-commercial and edu-
cational use, then this would be incompatible with the GPL as you can 
not restrict commercial use of GPLed code.

From all I could read about lyrics and the license terms provided on 
the lyric sites, the usage of lyris is restricted. And the lyrics 
are not compatbile to the GPL.

Therefore the GPL termination of 4. applies for the whole plugin.

And as the plugin is part of the wordpress software package as well, 
termination of the GPL is accross the whole package. (!)

Looks like the GPL has protection against violating code built-in.

I think the project should contact a lawyer to find out about what 
and what not can be done with the copyrighted lyrics of Hello Dolly.

Maybe it's possible for the wordpress project to redistribute the 
lyrics under the GPL? Someone with a well known name might ask 
the copyright holders?

Until then the copyrighted text can be replaced with something else 
to be on the safe side.

Or somebody could just go ask the writer of those lyrics.

His name is Jerry Herman. He's 79 years old and lives in West Hollywood.

It seems that currently he's been busy redesigning his apartment:

Sure, we could specify that it is GPL in the plugin. It's a good example to set.

I said *no* such thing. I said "The purpose is non-commercial and,
yes, educational." In context, it should be clear that I am talking
about the purpose and rationale behind its *existence*, not
establishing restrictions on its *use*. It's bewildering that you'd
jump to such a bad faith interpretation of my words.

Regarding copyright and fair use ? I weighed in already. This is not
an appropriate place to debate the matter.

In that case, I'd say filter it on the fly,
if ($pagenow = post-new.php) { return 'do_not_allow'; }
hooked into the cap system, It's a better solution (to me) than rewriting  
new metaboxes, which will potentially have to be re-done with WordPress  
upgrades to fit in or whatever.

Please don't feel offended. Read my words, we're not far away from each 
other:

I wrote "Intended" you wrote "Purpose".

Then I wrote "IF the use of the plugin is REALLY limited". That's hypo-
thetical. If you would have written about a concrete limitation you can bet 
that I would have reacted as concrete to it - not hypothetical.

What I think is more important then to assume bad faith is 
to think about the implications this has if the lyrics cause restrictions 
of any kind to the GPLed code.

It has been distributed to millions of sites of which I assume most of

Sure, as the regulars all know that the selection of the Hello Dolly Lyrics was 
and is a personal preference by Matt Mullenweg and is not related to 
anything educational. It's just Matt's hobby. He loves jazz. It's a specific 
text he wanted to have in there. I think that's the whole story behind the 
Hello Dolly lyrics. That's where the plugin has it's name from even.

That's why I would have never argued for fair use.

For the reality we share and in a publicly viewable space, I can only suggest 
to take care and fix this. Seriously. And with the best intentions.

I do think this would constitute fair use, in my non-professional (legally
speaking) opinion.

17 U.S.C. ? 107 Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 17 U.S.C. ? 106
and 17 U.S.C. ? 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use
by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by
that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,
teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or
research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the
use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be
considered shall include:

1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

2. the nature of the copyrighted work;

3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole; and

4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work.

   1. *Educational/Non-Commercial Use:* The use of the "Hello, Dolly!"
   lyrics do not further any educational purpose of the Plugin, and lack of use
   of those lyrics would not negatively detract from such educational purpose.
   Any public-domain lyrics could be used in place of the copyrighted work, and
   the educational purpose (to teach WordPress Plugin developers how to
   implement certain Plugin API features and other functions) would be
   furthered equally as it is with the copyrighted work being used. By the way:
   distributing the Plugin with WordPress? That lessens the "educational use"
   argument even more, because it makes the use less individual and/or
   spontaneous.

   2. *Nature of Copyrighted Work:* The nature of the copyrighted work -
   lyrics to a song - does not inherently lend the work to be used in the
   manner for which it is incorporated by the Plugin.

   3. *Substantiality/Extent of Use:* The Plugin incorporates the entire
   lyrics, not an excerpt or a snippet, but rather the entire work.

   4. *Market Effect:* The Plugin has no effect on the market for the
   original work.

#1 and #3 will kill any attempt at a fair-use infringement defense.

My primary concern is that the matter be taken seriously by the
powers-that-be. Given that wp-hackers isn't the appropriate venue for
ensuring that concern is met, I'll do my best to bow out of the discussion
now.

The educational use, IMO, is how the wordpress plugin system works.  Not to
mention the use is also non commercial.

Also it is my understanding that you do not have to meet all those criteria,
just have a balande, thus meeting just 2 of them is probably good enough,
meeting 3 or all 4 just makes an even stronger case.

Again this is based on my understanding and intrerpretation, im not a lawyer
but this seems obviously fair use to me.

Anyway i'll leave it at that.

Is it? The GPL excplicitly allows commercial use. So how can you write the use 
is non-commercial? Do you want to restrict my usage rights that are given by the 
GPL?

Hakre, here you're conflating use of *WordPress* with use of the *Hello
Dolly WordPress Plugin*.

IMHO, a potential copyright-infringement lawsuit regarding infringement of
the copyright for "Hello, Dolly!" would involve itself only with the uses of
the *Plugin*, not WordPress as a whole, given that the use of the *Plugin*
doesn't further any commercial uses of WordPress itself.

Actually, it's the other way around: if the copyright owner can refute any
one of the four components of the fair-use defense, then the use will be
deemed to be infringing. Now, certainly, there's a
degree-of-impact/infringement regarding each of the four components, but in
this case, I don't see how that helps.

Again: the educational use of the *Plugin* has nothing to do with the
educational use of the *copyrighted work*. The educational use regards
WordPress Plugin development, and nothing to do with the nature of the
copyrighted work (song lyrics), e.g. music appreciation, composition, etc.

"Hello, Dolly!" lyrics have nothing to do with WordPress Plugin development.
*Any* lyrics (or non-lyrical text, for that matter) could be used to
demonstrate the explode performed by the Plugin. Thus, use of the "Hello,
Dolly!" lyrics does not further the educational use of the Plugin.

And that's just Clause #1. Clause #3 ends any argument. The entirety of the
copyrighted work is incorporated into the Plugin.

Watching this discussion with fascination from the sidelines and really not wanting to get sucked in, I do have a question.  

It's been stated that wp-hackers is not the appropriate venue to discuss this and that trac is not the appropriate place to discuss this[1].  So where is the appropriate place to discuss this?  Not that I'm one who does want to debate this particular issue, but I am interested in knowing what other avenues for discussion when there are regarding questions of this type?

No. Wordpress itself ships with the Hello Dolly Lyrics. Download the ZIP[1] 
search the code and you'll find it.

I think the lyrics are more important here not how something is named: like 
plugin or add-on or extension or something else. It's a fragment of code and for 
both, the plugin and the main package a mixed work is created. that is to build 
a new work out of of multiple copyrightable works: the software package.

The copyright violation applies to both: The plugin package available at [2] and 
the wordpress pacakge at [1].

The GPL is terminated in both.

I didn't intend to end all such discussion; rather, my point was that a
wp-hackers discussion is not the best way to get the powers-that-be
(primarily, Matt) to hear, understand, and take seriously the concern being
expressed.

Otherwise, wp-hackers is pretty much the perfect place to have
yet-another-copyright-argument. :)  I'm just trying my best (and failing a
bit) to avoid feeding the argument, in this instance.

Once you have that table setup, and data going in, you could pull out 
posts doing useful things like location based order by with a SQL 
statement like this:

SELECT
     p.post_title, p.post_content,
     g.geo_id, g.geo_key, AsText(g.geo_value),
     GLength(LineStringFromWKB(LineString(
       POINT(40.9435272,-74.7296006), # Add your search location here - 
lat, lng
       AsBinary(geo_value))))
     AS distance
FROM wp_postgeo g
LEFT JOIN wp_posts p ON p.ID = g.post_id
WHERE p.post_type <> "revision" AND p.post_status <> "auto-draft"
ORDER BY distance ASC;

Pretty nifty stuff.

That's not quite true. Anyone can suggest agenda items, but they only 
make it onto the agenda if the lead devs want to put it there based on 
current priorities in the development cycle. Right now, for example, 
this issue is not going to take precedence over catching up on the 3.1 
release.

My statement shouldn't suggest that there is no such thing as "fair-use" for 
individual users of Hello Dolly and other lyrics. Rights under fair use remain.

But fair use does never cover relicensing under the terms of the GPL. You need 
the consent of the original copyright holder for that.

But you argue pro fair use because you know that you can gain rights without 
the copyright holders consent. Sure, this would be very neat, if claiming 
fair use would just solve the issue, but as written you get only limited rights 
by fair-use, nothing such exclusively like relicensing.

"Fair use is very limited and does not include creation of derivative works."
http://www.mail-archive.com/license-discuss at opensource.org/msg01375.html

At least this is how I understand it as well. So debating about fair-use while 
you talk about code that is creating derivates that get re-distributed under GPL
is misleading then.

See as well:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLFairUse

which explains that fair-use still applies to GPLed works.

Gee, sure would be nice to have this kind of activity on the WP-TESTERS
mailing list, as a result of, you know, testing things.

Thanks all for yet another display of talking about what *really* matters at
this exact moment.

Bottom line:

We are going to address this at the conclusion of the 3.1 cycle.

If you want to see this resolved, the best thing you can do is speed up the
end point of the 3.1 cycle by getting involved.

We have one dozen features to thoroughly test, many of them
developer-focused, and forty open tickets. We also have seen roughly
one-20th of the volume of wp-testers mail this cycle than we had last cycle.

Please. Honest plea. Get involved.

Stop distracting us further. In return, yes, we are aware this needs to be
discussed, and you can hold me to that come January.

For now, help us by trying to break Beta 2.

Regards,
Nacin

Andrew,
 I'm fairly new to the wp-hackers, and the development process, so
pardon my dumb questions.

We should join the testers list or the trac list?

http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo

I'll be going through the tickets in trac and try and submit patches to
things I can. I learnt a lot last week with our interaction on a
specific ticket, so I'll try and not over write my patch :).

The testers list is generally conversations about bugs before they become
Trac tickets. That's the perfect place to discuss things you find.

The Trac mailing list is a notification mailing list only, for every ticket
and comment. You probably don't want that. (On the other hand, I would
recommend the not-as-high-volume SVN list so you can learn from studying our
commits.)

If you want to help:

Skim core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5 or 6. Most of these tickets require
some inside knowledge (we triage this report every day in IRC -- today was a
few hours straight) but there might be some patches to test and possibly
things to break.

You can best help by testing the new features and looking for holes. Beat up
on multi-taxonomy queries, custom post type archives, custom capabilities
for custom post types, get_users(), the new import/export code, and the
like. Set up a 3.1 network and try to find bugs in the new network admin.

The beta 1 announcement has all of the main features listed. I would go
through and see what you want to lean on.

Cheers,

Nacin

That's very close to the structure I've been playing with, but I'd suggest adding a geo point column to that structure to store a centroid. It's a lot more efficient to index and calculate distances between them than for unconstrained areas.

But, I wonder if the correct model for a table like this is actually the tag/taxonomy tables. Just as any one post can relate to multiple locations, a single locations can relate to multiple posts.

Subject: [wp-hackers] hierarchical custom taxonomies vs good & old cats.
Message-ID: <AANLkTinwSp+VgXPZC=L3RXyTSZKSsTp7OSv13F4Re8zE@mail.gmail.com>

My understanding is that if I choose to create a hierarchical custom
taxonomy say "People", I will not be able to use tags that are under
its context.

Example case

people   ( this is a custom taxonomy )

---politicians  ( this is a sub level under the people cus. taxonomy )

And I want to add "obama" as a tag/term under the taxonomy above, i'm
out of luck. because with hierarchical cust. taxes, all I'm left with
is either to use post-tags or to create another sub level under
"politicians" as obama. both options no good. I wonder why I cannot
have a tag option under hierarchical taxonomies. there gotto be a
technical limitation on that as far as WP mechanics.

but if I choose people to be non-hierarchical, that I would be able to
tag items such as obama, mccain, etc easily.

In this case, ( I mean in the non-hierarchical case), I see great
value and organizational power. And this power is just not there out
of the box by simply using categories and tags. But the moment, you
choose to make your custom taxonomy a hierarchical one, you lose a
lot; your cus. tax. now acts exactly like a top level cat.

In other words, whether you create this structure as a top level
category titled "people" or as a hierarchical custom taxonomy titled
"people", it makes no difference as far as practical results.

people

----politicians

----celebrities

----athletes


Am I right?

I think you're referring to the URLs, right?

You want:
example.com/people/politicians/obama/

But you're getting:
example.com/obama/

If I'm correct, then you're in luck, WordPress 3.1 (currently in late beta)
contains support for hierarchical URLs for hierarchical taxonomies.

When registering your taxonomy, you'll pass an array to the 'rewrite' flag,
with 'hierarchical' => true.

May I point to the fact - and that's important to any wordpress developer - that 
since the GPL has terminated for the wordpress package (incl. the use of the SVN 
and beta versions), all developers who participate in beta do not have a right 
to aquire nor to edit the files of wordpress unless they are in full compliance 
again.

So just before anyone is actively encouraging other developers to violate the 
GPL, I can only give the following tip:

     If you care about your rights with the wordpress software, 
    remove the Hello Dolly plugin. Or remove only the Hello Dolly
    lyrics in  there if you want to keep the plugin. 

Source: http://wp.me/pLEEp-mPb

> 
> Regards,
> Nacin

You would - as you have commit rights - save other hackers a lot of headaches by 
removing the copyright infringing lyrics from the code-base until the situation 
has been clarified.

This would be helpful for any person participating in the beta, so to say, get 
things moving forward.

Otherwise you're getting closer to asking developers to ignore and violate the 
GPL than to ensure that the GPL gets properly applied on the code-base.

You should care less about shortly interrupting some release scheduling (which 
is behind anyway according to jane) but to be thankful that such finally got 
reported and the attention it deserves. Keep in mind that the copyright 
infringement has been already reported 11 month ago. You know the ticket as you 
closed it.

I'm looking for the ability to remove fully formed HTML links so
convert:

<a href="http://www.domain.com/">Anchor Text</a>

and derivatives, to something like

http://www.domain.com/ : Anchor Text

I'm using a plugin (http://ducedo.com/remove-links-in-comments/) that
prevents text URLs from being converted to full links 

WordPress by default converts http://www.domain.com/ to

<a href="http://www.domain.com/"
rel="nofollow">http://www.domain.com/</a>

The above plugin turns that off, so http://www.domain.com/ stays
http://www.domain.com/ (just text, so no nofollow links).

If I can get the above working (stripping HTML from fully formed
links), after WordPress 3.1 is released my theme will only need the
plugin above to have a WordPress site with no nofollow links. Also
going to give the option to follow links as well, so the above filter
will probably come in handy.

Not started the above yet (I don't expect to have any big problems
stripping the HTML code from links), still scratching my head over
removing the nofollow from the reply to comments links (not very
important as 3.1 fixes the problem). I'm sure you already know the
filter you suggested won't work on the nofollow of the reply to
comments links because the nofollow attribute is hard coded in
/wp-includes/comment-template.php was hoping I could use a simple
str_replace on the Reply links, but not getting it to work.

Funny I was just going to say this anyway, and then you went and asked the question!

Something I've figured out to do is to make sure my dev URL has the same number of characters as the live URL, so as to avoid mucking up serialized arrays if I have to do a mass search/replace.

So... I used to use example.local for developing example.com.  Now I use example.dev

Also -- As this clearly a case that a lot of people have issues with, it would be nice if somebody (who understands the solutions better than I do) would write a "Dev Site" Plugin that automatically swaps in the Dev URL on a test site.  The way I see it it would be a plugin you run on the dev site, and you don't need it on the live site.  Thus the extra overhead, etc doesn't affect the live site.

Regards to all (and Happy Christmas!)

That was so easy, i do it in 3 easy steps:
1. Export local mysql tables and import on web host
2. FTP all the WP files to web host
3. Access http://www.myproductionsite.com/searchreplacedb.php

that single php file (searchreplacedb.php) is great, it even get your local
site url from options table on "look for", you just need to fill the
"Replace to".
It scans all WP tables on your database.

You can download it here:

Just to complicate this slightly - sometimes the *actual* URL isn't
always known until *after* the project has been developed.

A nicer way of URL handling, as per other projects we work with, would
also be beneficial in this use-case.

The ob_start solution I gave earlier will handle that case. The key is
to store the *actual* URL, then use code to adjust it on-the-fly for
your non-production sites.

Try this plugin:

How to use:

It solves the problem with a slightly different approach.

In my experience, this is not entirely true.  I've recently discovered that automatic updates don't work for PHP < 5.x.  While I've noted it in the Codex, it's not clear if this is a bug or a feature.

I can't imagine that's a feature, if the requirement is 4.3+ . I've sent 
a note to wp-testers. Maybe we can get someone to second that.

PHP 4.3+ is a requirement for WordPress to operate, but some features will
still be incompatible with those versions of PHP.  I can confirm that
automatic updates fail for PHP < 5 on at least GoDaddy, 1and1 and
MediaTemple.  However, WordPress still works just fine and you can still
perform a manual (FTP) update.

At the same time, it is possible in almost all cases to upgrade your hosting
from PHP4 to PHP5.

   - Godaddy:
   http://www.ardamis.com/2009/07/25/upgrading-godaddy-hosting-to-php-5-x-from-php-4-3-11/
   - 1and1: http://faq.1and1.com/scripting_languages_supported/php/5.html
   - MediaTemple:
   http://kb.mediatemple.net/questions/244/How+can+I+specify+the+version+of+php+for+web+applications+on+the+(gs)+Grid-Service%3F

PHP4 compatibility has been maintained for so long with WordPress for people
who aren't able to upgrade their PHP installation, either because they don't
know how or because their hosts don't allow it.  With just about any
mainstream web host, though, it's possible to upgrade almost instantaneously
by selecting a toggle somewhere, changing your .htaccess file, or adding a
line to php.ini.  In any case, the upgrade to PHP5 takes less time than the
automatic update does in WordPress - if you can, do it.

But the actual system requirements for a new installation of WordPress are
the same: PHP 4.3 and MySQL 4.1.2.

If automatic upgrades don't work on PHP 4.3 that sounds like a bug to me.

I take it you reported this in trac?

I have various customers on GoDaddy and MediaTemple running PHP < 5 and 
they're able to auto-updatee just fine. Not sure I've ever seen a 
problem with auto-udates isolated to the specific PHP version.

Just wanted to throw that out there, not sure this is a PHP version problem.

Thanks,

You state this as a fact... Where did you get your law degree? If you don't
have a law degree, where is the professional opinion of a lawyer on this?
Better yet, what court ruled on the termination of the GPL for WordPress?

Until you can provide me the above info, these are nothing but your personal
opinions.

I mentioned in a few times back in WP 2.8 and when 3.0 first came out, and
"some features won't work with PHP 4" was the repeated response I got.
 After hearing that repeatedly, I assumed it wasn't a bug and never reported
it to Trac.

The fact that certain hosts' update issues with PHP4 was actually documented
in the Codex (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Core_Update_Host_Compatibility#Works_with_caveats)
also made me somewhat hesitant.  So ... is this a bug?  Or a host-specific
issue over which WordPress has no control?

One set of sites I have is on 1and1.  Automatic updates do not work in the default configuration (PHP 4.x).  The update hangs on "downloading zip..."  If you do the one change of add the mapping to the .htaccess file, to force PHP 5.x) they do work.  That, to me, is clear proof of a 5.x dependency.

It is quite true that, as far as I can determine, the sites work fine on 4.x with manual upgrading.

Good point. There could be something turned off by default on the PHP4 
that isn't off in php5.  WAAAAAY back when, on what drove me to php5 on 
1and1.com was that some  fancy new plugin called "Gravatars" couldn't 
automatically download the files the local images.  IIRC 1and1 had 
file_get_contents() or some such turned off on php4.  php5 worked fine.  
That was 4+ years ago, so the exact function eludes me, but it sounds 
like this could be a similar issue.

No it isn't.

It's clear proof that for that hosts configuration of PHP4 it isn't working.

Completely different from a dependency on PHP5 for that code.

Or the other way to look at it is 1and1 may have something hosed in 
their PHP 4.x config. Not saying this is the case, but I've seen crazier 
things happen.

In the end, to me, there is no clear proof of a dependency here.

If there is even one auto-update working in php4, which you report is 
the case, then there can't be a php5 dependency.  These hosts probably 
have /allow_url_fopen /set to 0 or some such similar configuration./

Great, whatever.  One of the largest hosts in the world has an issue with an old configuration of software they will not likely change.  Moving to PHP5 is the solution.  I put a note to that effect into the Codex on Updating.

Turns out I was also incorrect, after manually updating to WP 3.x I couldn't get logged into the dashboard on these sites without changing to PHP5.  1and1's support knows this, and will walk you through the .htaccess fix.

So, for users on 1and1, their experience is that WP's minimum requirement is PHP 5.x.  Given that, again, 1and1 is a huge host, and that WP would, presumably, like to work on their systems out of the box without each user having to call support, either the code or the requirements need to change.

Perhaps the fix here too is to just document it away.  I'll leave that to the astute powers that be here to decide.  If we're done painting the "Hello Dolly" bikeshed.

"Cheers"

Just to add;  ComicPress my theme works fine on other peoples php4 hosting, 
and not 1and1, has to use php5 on 1and1

http://comicpress.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3597&highlight=1and1

It is also a known fix to switch to php 5 on 1and1 as well for buddypress 
(or was at the time in prev. revisions of buddypress)

Automatic upgrades are definitely not PHP 5 dependent, however they
are dependent upon the specific setup and configuration of the host in
question. In the case of many hosts, the PHP 5 setup is better or more
robust and thus automatic upgrades may work better on that.

This is definitely the case for GoDaddy hosting. I've confirmed this
multiple times.

Thanks for clarifying, Otto.  I didn't intend to imply that WordPress'
updates are PHP 5 dependent.  They're not.  But on some hosts, I've had
better success using PHP 5 than using PHP 4.

Automatic updates on 1and1 just won't work with PHP 4.

On MediaTemple, just about everything works ... but if you try to do things
too fast they have some weird timeout issue with PHP 4 ... this affects
automatic updates (i.e. attempting to update several - more than 3 or 4 -
plug-ins at once) and some XML RPC functions.  But the issue is intermittent
and I haven't been able to diagnose the actual cause.  Updating to PHP 5
fixed it, so I haven't bothered to go back and investigate further.

On GoDaddy I have strange, intermittent issues of all varieties running PHP
4 ... not just with WordPress, but with any system running under PHP 4 ...
so I avoid it like the plague.

*In general, though, WordPress is compatible with PHP 4 ... though not every
host (professional or otherwise) is running a clean, bug-free PHP 4 system.
 Additional Apache modules introduce other levels of complexity and failure.
 Shared hosting (which several of us use due to the low cost) introduces
others.*

Please read the license text that ships with the wordpress package. In specific 
point 4:

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

You don't need to have a law degree to understand that the Hello Dolly Lyrics 
are most certainly not available under GNU GPL and the original author nor 
wordpress.org has the right to re-distribute it under GNU GPL.

Ergo the rights have been terminated as the re-distribution of the Hello Dolly 
Lyrics is obviously limited. Remember that wordpress itself is a fork and the 
intimidating part has been added after forking the original software.

Looks like a pretty simple thing to me, and isn't this what the GPL is famous 
for? A permissive license.

For a deeper insight and even more legal argumentation there are probably more 
resources and other places to discuss this in detail.

E.g. see 5.2 Termination in:

http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/compliance-guide.html

In this mailinglist I think the main point should be about how to achieve that 
our users can re-distribute wordpress safely under the GNU GPL. I think 
everybody can support such a statement.

My understanding of MySQL isn't all that advanced, nor am I familiar 
with GIS terms (if GIS is the right term itself lol) - I'm not even sure 
what you said. I used a GEOMETRY type instead of POINT, because I though 
it might be useful to put types in there other than POINT - but I have 
no idea what kind of affect that has on performance. I do know that 
doing the distance calculation on my existing table is not utilizing the 
geo_key (according to EXPLAIN) - it's also doing a filesort.

I also didn't have any luck using the Distance function in MySQL - it 
just plain didn't work.

I haven't looked into that at all. Still new to WordPress in general, 
but you might be right. :-)

No Nacin, That wasn't what I was referring to. sorry it wasn't
clear... here is the attemp2...

Tags ( the built-in tag's I'm taking about ) is open ended. If I
create a tag called say "apple", there is no context. Is it the
computer apple? Is it the fruit apple? But If were to create
taxonomies "fruits" and "computers",  I would have had the choice of
inserting the word "apple" under the fruits taxonomy without mixing
and matching, well, apples and oranges. ( what a confusing expression
to refer to. )

So, when I create a tag cloud for the fruits taxonomy, clicking on the
word "apple" under the fruits cloud , that click woud never pull the
Apple inc. stuff.  but, that's old business, the non-hier taxonomies
already allow you to do this.

So where is the problem?

The problem is, that i lose all that power if I were choose to
configure the fruits taxonomy to be as hierarchical.

Because with a hierarchical taxonomy, I no longer add the word
"apple", the same way I did with the non-hierarchical case. At this
point, my two options are either to add the "apple" into the tags
taxonomy as a good & old tag, or create an "apple" term and make its
parent id Fruits. But then at this point, the system starts behaving
exactly like the good & old cats.

 if I were to create  2 groupings under the fruits taxonomy for
example as "multi-color fruits", and I wanted to add the comma
separated list "apple, grape, berry" under the "multi-color fruits" in
one go. I cannot. That's the problem.

In this example, the apple, grape stuff is screaming to be added as
tag items. But, they end up getting into as children of "multi-color
fruits", one at a time where at each time you need the point the
parent ID, exactly like the way cats work, not the way tags work.

sorry for the long expression but there yo have it.
I don't know if I was able to make the point clearer now?

The ideal ( and the most natural ) solution would be one that gives me
the power to do this;

step 1
create fruits taxonomy, make it hierarchical.

step 2
create a term called "multi-color fruits" under the fruits taxonomy.

step 3
when you are adding a post and you want to tag it as apple, and also
as berry ( just because the post is talking about a recipe which only
uses apple and berries), you put a checkbox on the "multi-color
fruits" and then add the apple and berry in a comma separated way in
one go as apple,berry into another text box in the WP UI ( which is
currently not available).

the benefits of having something like this is this; it only extends
the power of custom taxonomies by giving them the tag grouping power
to its any level groupings.

so that when my visitors are on that recipe page,

they would be seeing something like this

Fruits:     multi-color fruits, apple, grape

where clicking on "multi-color fruits" will bring the posts that has
been assigned to "multi-color fruits" which may bring posts that's
been tagged not only by apple and grape but also berries.

and where clicking on "apple" will bring only those posts that has
been tagged with apple, while excluding the Apple Inc. related posts
that have also been tagged as "apple".

I didn't really understand that, but now I'm hungry for some reason. ;)


So your basic issue here is that you want hierarchical like
categories, but the ability to insert terms at-will like tags?

That doesn't make a whole lot of sense, really, because if you can
insert them at-will, then there's no hierarchy inherent to them. Even
if you assume that you can check a box to define a parent for your
at-will terms, that's more limiting than categories because I can
assign categories from different parents to the same post.

In other words, this sounds like either a misapplied design problem or
a user-interface issue.

More to the point, how would this theoretical hierarchy that you can
create on the fly be useful? What value is there to having a hierarchy
on tags, for example? What would you use it for?

I think the real issue is the venom towards potential future and current
contributors. I think based on this thread and ticket that the attitude
towards topics and tickets that the core team doesn't like will be addressed
like children on the playground and I'm seriously considering not
participating in the future [1].

I suggest listening to "How Open Source Projects Survive Poisonous People" (
http://video.google.nl/videoplay?docid=-4216011961522818645#) again and take
handling problematic people to heart. Creating a divide hurts the community.

Jacob Santos

[1] I'm a little bit bias, because I have no intention of contributing. This
thread just solidifies that for me. I do wonder if this was how the
community was before a lot of the team was split off and started Habari?

Don't get me wrong, I think you need both a point and a geometry column: one to support searching the data and the other to display the area it represents. 

Searching for points near a given point should work efficiently, but mysql has to do a lot more work on geometry columns to answer questions like that. I don't have the docs in front of me, but I'm not sure if the distance function works on geometry values (maybe just points).

Generally speaking, the cathedral model is when something is built behind
closed doors, then released as open source. The bazaar model is when the
code is built in the open. The bazaar model has taken hold in most open
source projects. Some still begin in the cathedral model. Google developed
Chrome behind closed doors before releasing it, but after that point,
Chromium is iterated out in the open.

Haluk, I would recommend custom taxonomies (http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Taxonomies 
) Use a custom taxonomy fruit, a custom taxonomy devices, etc.

The members of the core team are all nice people (at least, all the  
one's I've met), but when they tell you to leave something alone (at  
least for the time being) usually it's good to listen to them ? they  
have a lot on their plate and need to prioritize.

Otto,

I just got around to trying this out. At first I thought this was perfect and I took ur advice on modifying the hosts file to point to my own machine for the live URL. Then I tried to access wp-admin and I have an issue, maybe you've dealt with this so you can help me out.

I (will) have a staging server at 'stage.example.com' and the site lives at 'example.com', so I set my output buffering callback function like this:

function my_callback($out) {
  	str_replace('example.com', 'stage.example.com', $out);
	return str_replace('http://example.com', 'http://stage.example.com', $out);
}

I am trying to be extra cautious about the url, although i don't like the fact that if anywhere in my content i talk about example.com it will automatically be changed to stage.example.com, but in this case that won't happen so lets just ignore that.

on my staging machine I added a line to /etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1 stage.example.com

the machine also has a vhost running whose ServerName (apache specfic i guess) is set to stage.example.com and points to the directory in which the site lives.

I am pretty sure I did all the steps right, but what would it take for my client to be able to visit stage.example.com/wp-admin in order to see the admin section as usual?

sorry the line in the function should read:

$out = str_replace('example.com', 'stage.example.com', $out);

still same issue.

If I may add, the book by Karl Fogel "Producing Open Source Software - 
How to Run a Successful Free Software Project" named in the talk is 
available online and worth the read:

http://producingoss.com/

For those of us who are able to read german, an excellent recent title 
by Michael Prokop called "Open Source Projektmanagement" was published 
by open source press:

http://release-it.org/

I do highly recommend it as well.

If you want your client to see the staging site, then the staging site
has to be somewhere that they can see it. This means that if you're
running it on the local machine, then that ain't going to work.

I was kind of assuming that stage.example.com was a live site
somewhere on the internet. If you're developing locally, then no magic
in the world will put the local install on the live internet... short
of actually putting the machine on the live internet as a server with
a domain name pointing to it.

You would need a VPN type solution to accomplish that type of situation.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Batch Change Post Authors
Message-ID: <AANLkTikS6i4yuTjhndHV5QKgo8+cLFMnXT9LnSZFn5P+@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys! Straight to the subject:

I have +3700 posts which I'd like to export, but as you could imagine it'd
create a massive file "impossible" to import into another WP install. So I
thought, well, MySQL Dumper -> quite a decent file size, etc. Issue is,
content is in Spanish so each entry that has a "?" or letters with tilde
(?,?,?,?,?) produces entries without title.

Then I thought: why not change the authors of the posts and export them by
author. That generates a smaller size file, therefore the import process is
smooth. Now, is there a way to batch change this? Say, via SQL? Or
displaying more than 20 entries per page? That way I could batch change the
authors via the Post panel.

I'd create 10 authors and assign to each one of them 370 posts. Any
suggestion?

Thanks!

How about exporting by date range? Should be able to get smaller files
without having to mess with anything else.

Drop down the screen options tab (top right of posts panel) and set the
number to "show on screen" to be 370.

Also report the spanish chars issue to the plugin author, they may fix it.

I put stage.* on the same server as the live site but in a different
directory, and set it up as a normal subdomain wherever your domain
settings live (probably the registrar). I also put an easy http auth
password on the stage site so the public can't get in.

This works well for showing it to clients because you can keep working
on your local copy while knowing that the stage site is running a
stable snapshot of the code. It also means that before passing
directly from your local server to the live site all new versions
spend some time being tested on the live server, which may have a
different enough configuration to need some config/code tweaks. It
also gives you a chance to test your "deployment" whatever that might
be, so you'll notice that plugin setting you forgot to account for
etc.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Confusion About WordPress Cache
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=Vg1gwUxxN4tQkpnOgSPXovDFiCd0khh5denK1@mail.gmail.com>

I am using WordPress Cache to cache data retrieved from database, using
WP_Cache <http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Cache>.

After I  used wp_cache_set to set some data in the cache, I try to get it by
wp_cache_get in ANOTHER post request.

However, it failed to retrieve the data I have previously saved.

It is ok if I try to retrieve the data in just one request(place the *set*and
*get * in the same script). *However, in separate *
*
*
*requests, I doesn't work.*

I wonder if I got the wrong idea of what *cache* is. I have it in mind that
*cache *can be preserved even in different requests

from the same user.*Then the cache has nothing different with a variable, I
think!!*

And I am doubting my idea now!

Can anyone help? Or it is not what I am thinking. *Is there any way to
retrieve the same data which has been saved *
*
*
*before(not using database) in separate requests? *


Really thanks for any response!

Best regards!

Xiaohan

The cache API in core WordPress provides just an object cache, but you
can use a persistent caching tool to extend it to do what you want.

See <http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Cache> under
"Persistent Caching Plugins."

Also, you may be able to accomplish what you need with transients:

How about exporting by date range? Should be able to get smaller files
without having to mess with anything else.

The object cache doesn't default to storing data between requests,
because it doesn't have anywhere to store it between those requests.
So for normal usage, it just acts like a memory cache in a single
request. However, if you do have a persistent storage medium, like a
memcached setup or something, then there are plugins which will extend
the wp_cache system to be persistent across requests. Example:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/memcached/. For this reason, the
object cache should be treated as if it's (unreliable) persistent
storage even when it's not that way by default.

Like Austin said, the Transients API is also another option if you
need to store data with an expiration date attached to it. However,
this should not be used for storing data that is retrieved from the
database, since transients are (by default) stored in the database
anyway. Transients are intended to be used to store data that is
expensive to create and which will need to be re-created every so
often (such as data retrieved from another server, or data that takes
a lot of processing to calculate).

lol no i know it needs to be on the internet, that wasn't the issue at all. in fact, all the steps i took should be the same (i think) for the setup in which the stage is on the same machine as the live site. im not specifying any IP addresses, the subdomain gets resolved by the DNS, so it doesn't matter what machine the stage is on, the buffering just needs to put that subdomain in there. i just had 127.0.0.1 in the hosts because i wanted to test (on my machine) what a request going to stage would look like. i guess i didn't phrase that clearly, but i was trying to mimic the staging machine on my own dev machine before touching the server we use for live.

i actually figured out why i couldn't get to wp-admin after digging into the code myself, i was just hoping someone was up that had done this before and gave me a quick answer. the problem was that output buffering doesn't apply to response headers which get sent immediately. therefore by the time the callback is fired, a redirect in the header has already taken place. the fix i found to work so far is to add this somewhere (i put it in my theme for now, but i'm thinking ill put it in a plugin later):

// Redirect Plug for Development
function redirect_to_stage($location, $status) {
	$location = str_replace('example.com', 'stage.example.com', $location);
	return $location;
}
add_filter('wp_redirect', 'redirect_to_stage');

I recently struggled through this exact situation and will add that you
should be very careful to test any other queries in your theme and make sure
they aren't being affected. The code above will affect ALL posts queries
everywhere on your site because it is added to the general pre_get_posts
hook.

In my case this meant that my 'recent posts' in the sidebar and other
secondary loops were affected in ways I couldn't predict and didn't want.

To get around this I wanted the query var to only be added for the 'main'
query for any given page. My solution was to add the 'pre_get_posts' hook
during the 'parse_request' action because it runs only once per pageload at
the time when the main query and status of the current page is being
determined. Then, inside my manipulation callback the first thing I do is
run remove_action() on itself. This ensures that the manipulated query vars
only take effect once, on the first query run after parse_query, which in my
testing was always the 'main' query for the page.

The code, massively simplified, looks like this (
http://pastebin.com/B3YxmSGh )


function gv_query_manipulation_parse_request() {

     add_action('pre_get_posts', 'gv_query_manipulation_pre_get_posts');
}
add_action('parse_request', 'gv_query_manipulation_parse_request');

function gv_query_manipulation_pre_get_posts($wp_query){
    global $excluded_category;

    remove_action('pre_get_posts', 'gv_query_manipulation_pre_get_posts');

    if (is_admin() OR is_feed())
        return;

    $wp_query->query_vars['category__not_in'][] = $excluded_category;

    return;
}

Note that I've explicitly excluded is_admin and is_feed from being affected.
You should consider these other situations where pre_get_posts takes effect
and add negative checks as necessary.

Jeremy, 

In your code you are calling the function is_feed(). Isn't this wrong? 

When you call the is_* functions (exluding is_admin()) like is_home(), is_search(), is_archive() etc. they check the setting of the global $wp_query object. But this is not always the correct instance of the WP_Query object being queried. In other words some other part of the code may create a new instance. 

Instead the better solution (IMHO) is to check the $query object like: 
	
if ($query->is_feed) {
}

if ($query->is_home) {
}

if ($query->is_archive) {
}
 
if ($query->is_single) {
}

Unreliable - in that it should only be used for short to medium term 
storage as the data goes away when the daemon or machine restarts. So 
your retrieval of values should always fall back to generating the values.

So in psuedocode, you'd have something like this:

if (!$value = retrievefunction($networkid . '_' . $blogid . 
'_variablename')) {
    long();
    drawnout();
    generation();
   $value = finalprocessing();
}

Obviously that will look nothing like your final code, but I wanted to 
show that the actually value you store will, as with any global 
variable, needs to have a unique name or it will be overwritten.

So, in a multisite environment, you should store your values under names 
that specify their scope.   So, something that is global to all your 
networks needs to have nothing or perhaps a standardized 'global_' 
prefix. If it is for all sites on one network, prefix it with the 
network id. If it is specific to a site on a network, prefix it with the 
network AND site id.

Even in a single site blog, setting up your cache names correctly now 
will save you headaches when 2 years down the line you decide to merge 
two blogs together or move your theme over to a multisite blog.

Core supports exporting by author. It sounded like Joaquin had all
posts by the same author, so wanted a quick way of changing the
authors in order to make use of export by author. I just suggested
that date range filtering was also available and would probably be
easier than changing authors and mapping them back again on import.

In the case of my code above it only runs once on the first query after
parse_request, which is almost definitely the main query.

In any event what I want to know is "Are we in an RSS feed context?" and
is_feed() answers that question for the page as a whole. If we ARE in an RSS
feed then there will only ever be one query, the one that returns the feed
items. This means the question is really whether you want the
category__not_in (or whatever other query var) to affect feed results,
there's no other queries in feed pages that you need to worry about.

Yeah date range would definately be my first choice to segment the 
export/import file

Core supports exporting by author. It sounded like Joaquin had all
posts by the same author, so wanted a quick way of changing the
authors in order to make use of export by author. I just suggested
that date range filtering was also available and would probably be
easier than changing authors and mapping them back again on import.

I've tracked this down to some wrong records in wp_term_relationships
on both of the installations, which connected the pages with the first
category. Not sure where they came from, but I guess it's not a bug.

Will use wp-testers list next time. Thanks!

I believe there must be a way to optimize this. I just don't know how I

I'll try some things - I don't think my Distance alternative is working 
right anyway...

Otto,

Whenever we use a non-hierarchical custom taxonomy ( say fruits for
instance), the terms ( such as apple,grape,fruit) goes under the
context of that taxonomy.  I call this the clever way of tagging. Tags
within a custom taxonomy are clever because they know their context.
The "apple" for instance know exactly that is the fruit apple and not
the computer Apple. Therefore, clicking on the apple tag pulls only
the fruit apples.

But... if I were to set the "fruits taxonomy" as hierarchical, then
this concept goes out of the window.

Perhaps this is the reason why the core team decided to set the
default as hierarchical = false! Cause when they are set as FALSE, it
really does wonders as a CMS...  it in facts, blows the built-in tags
taxonomy out of water. But, when they are set as TRUE, it offer NO
ADVATAGE over the built-in category taxonomy.

Let's now assume that we turn the fruits to be hierarchical

First, I'm unable to add "apple, grape and berries" in one go. I have
to take them one at a time...

Let's work with an example, maybe silly, but maybe that will make my point...

OK. create a taxonomy called "numbers" and build this hierarchy on it

numbers
----odd numbers
--------1
--------3
--------5
----even numbers
--------2
--------4

The above currently available. May be not convenient, but it is available.

It is not convenient, because when I have a post that deals with say,
1, 3, 411, I have to add each of these one by one.
enter 1 set its parent,
enter 3 set its parent
enter 411 set its parent

wouldn't you wish that there was a way to add "1,3,441" in one go (
exactly like the post-tag taxonomy allows you ) and you are done!

If the UI allowed me to do the following, what I'm proposing could
have been done.

Again, I create my numbers taxonomy and I set it as "hierarchical" and
then I add my immediate cats under it.

numbers
----odd numbers
----even numbers

that's it.  I'm good to go for tagging when the time comes...

assume, I'm on a post and I want to add tags 1,3,411 to it. Obviously,
they all are "odd numbers". so what do I do?

I click on "odd numbers", a text box opens up right beneath it, I type
"1,3,441" on it. And I'm done. I just tagged the post hierarchically
under "odd numbers".

Since this kind of UI does not exist, I cannot do that.

now coming to your very valid questions... which are

how would this theoretical hierarchy that you can create on the fly be useful?
What value is there to having a hierarchy on tags?
For example.. What would you use it for?

By alllowing tags a hierarchy of their own, and a context of their
own, I achieve the best of both worlds.

Say, I'm on a post, then the post will have this;

Numbers: odd numbers, 1, 3

If the user clicks on "odd numbers", WP will pull all the posts
"effortlessly" that has 1 or 3 or 441 or whatever is out there?
how is that possible? well, because tags are hierarchial and the tag
"odd number" will be aware of its children...

And on the other hand, if the user clicks on 1, then WP will pull only
those that has been tagged as 1

Isn't that the best of both worlds?

of course clicking 1 will NOT bring those posts that has been tagged
as 1 outside of the "NUMBERS TAXONOMY".

....

Maybe, the "odd_numbers" and tagging posts as 1 3 and so on does not
PRACTICALLY make sense, but I wanted to give a quick example of how a
"TAG HIERARCHY" could simplify lifes and bring a value to using the
custom taxonomies in "hierarchial=true" mode

The bottom line is...

I see no advantage gain by setting a custom taxonomy hierarchical. I
already got that with good old cats.

Your examples are very specific, and all the UI's you would like ARE  
possible (just not built into core, as they're such niche items IMO, a  
Plugin can create a taxonomies custom metabox with ease.)

Take this custom taxonomy for example:
Fruits
  - Citrus
    - Lemon
    - Orange
  - Nut
    - Peacan

That organises it into a hierarchical data type, The fruits are stored  
under a parent which all the children relate to.

You can also use something such as:
CountryStates
  - AU
    - NSW
    - QLD
  - US
    - CA
    - GA
  - UK
    - England

Choosing a hierarchical type over something else purely depends on how you  
think about the data, and if the parents have a useful grouping to their  
children.

In the same reasoning, Why would you use Categories over Tags? I mean, You  
can add "Politics, USA" to your tags list! There's no need to add the  
Poilitics and the USA sub-category of it..
But that's not how most people would utilise categories and tags, Most  
would tag their item with single broad topics, and file it under a  
category which drills down to a specific.

Use a flat custom taxonomy for a Broad terms
Use a hierarchical custom taxonomy when you want the ability to drill down  
to items from "Broad -> More Specific -> Specific"

But.. what exactly do you get out of that? Why would you want tags to
be in a hierarchy? That doesn't make any real sense to me.

Hierarchical taxonomies are generally used for very well-defined broad
sets of things. Categories, basically. The point being that often
these categories are predefined and you are simply picking them from a
list.

What you're talking about is essentially allowing tags to have
hierarchy, and I get that. I can even visualize a UI to do it. But I
still don't see the point of it. What is the purpose? What is it that
fundamentally changes by having tags in a hierarchy, exactly?


> I see no advantage gain by setting a custom taxonomy hierarchical. I

Do you see any advantage in making a custom taxonomy non-hierarchical?
Why is that? I mean, after all, you can already get that with good old
tags...

You're looking at it from the wrong angle. Custom taxonomies are there
to allow you to create groups of related terms. How you create those
groups, whether they be on-the-fly poorly defined sets of terms or
well-defined sets of hierarchically structured terms, is irrelevant to
the purpose of having them be custom in the first place. They're
custom because you want to be able to group related terms together
into sets. A taxonomy is a set. That's it. How you arrange that and
define that set is up to you.

What I'm really asking is why do you want taglike-taxonomies to be
capable of having hierarchy? What does having hierarchy on a tag-like
set give you the ability to do that you don't have now?

Giving tags hierarchy makes no sense. Tags are created on the fly, by
definition they don't need hierarchy because they are not well-defined
sets of terms to put into hierarchical structures. Hierarchical
structures by nature assume advance planning and definitions being
created for them.

For your even/odd example, you should use two taxonomies. Even and
odd, both tag-like. Because having the even/odd categories which hold
number terms doesn't make any real sense. It doesn't give you
anything. You can't *do* anything special with that structure.

Message-ID: <1FBDF66F-4650-4F67-8524-5FF488053FB4@codehooligans.com>

All,

So I have my little plugin, Media-Tags. This plugin adds a new taxonomy and some UI hook to allow tagging (non-heirarchial) or attachments. This plugin works pretty well and has been for the past two years. Of the handful of template functions users can call from their theme is a function list_mediatags which functions and performs much like the functions for listing post tags in the sidebar. 

I just had someone post a comment on my blog asking if there was an easy was to exclude or hide the media-tags term for posts that are not published. In my thinking the media-tags term is associated to the attachment not the parent of the attachment. So when I use standard WP functions like get_terms I'm returned the list of terms in the media-tags taxonomy. 

Can anyone think of an easy way to do this using standard WordPress logic? Or I should say other than looping through all the terms. Then looping through that term's attachments. Then getting the attachment's parent post_status for each item?

I'm thinking this is the only solution but I know there are folks lot smarter than I am on this list.

Note: I orginally posted this to the wp forums, but didn't get any response.
I find you guys to generally be much more helpful, anyway!

So, I'm working on a plugin and wanted to see if there was a way to avoid
the plugin operating on suspicious accounts, like spam accounts. Browsing
around, I noticed that there is a field in the table called "spam," but as
yet, I have not discovered where this field is set?

I've looked in both the individual blog administration and the site
administration stuff - I'm running a converted MU site - but can't seem to
find it. However, if I set the field directly in the database, the user
shows up red highlighted in the user admin area, so clearly, WordPress is
currently using it somehow.

Can anyone shed any light on what the deal is with this field? Is it being
deprecated? Thanks a lot!

FWIW you guys should avoid get_posts() either way, it's a loser function and
I don't know any use-cases where you aren't better off fetching the full
WP_Query object instead by doing:

$myresults = new WP_Query($args);

That way you can do $myresults->have_posts() and friends. It's also almost
definitely less buggy than get_posts() because core developers probably
never use get_posts(). Glad to see the bug with fixed though :)

We use it a little actually:

./wp-admin/includes/nav-menu.php:				$search_results = get_posts( array( 's' => $searched, 'post_type' => $post_type_name, 'fields' => 'all', 'order' => 'DESC', ) );
./wp-includes/class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php:		$pages = get_posts( array('post_type' => 'page', 'post_status' => 'any', 'numberposts' => $num_pages) );
./wp-includes/class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php:		$attachments = get_posts( array('post_type' => 'attachment', 'post_parent' => $parent_id, 'offset' => $offset, 'numberposts' => $number, 'post_mime_type' => $mime_type ) );
./wp-includes/post.php:	$children = get_posts( $r );
./wp-includes/post.php:	$results = get_posts( $r );
./wp-includes/nav-menu.php:	$items = get_posts( $args );
./wp-includes/media.php:		$_attachments = get_posts( array('include' => $include, 'post_status' => 'inherit', 'post_type' => 'attachment', 'post_mime_type' => 'image', 'order' => $order, 'orderby' => $orderby) );

I will try to use you guys' ***your own words*** -  to be on the same page...

Take a ***well defined broad cat.*** PEOPLE. Let's add sub to it. "POLITICIANS".
That's perfect, because it is ***more specific*** than PEOPLE thus the
reasoning for another ***well defined broad*** group under PEOPLE.

So we got People > Politicians so far. For the same token, we can
perfectly introduce "Movie Stars". And we all know how that would go in;
that is another sub-cat under the "People" taxonomy, as a sibling to
"politicians".

So far, there is no problem in the way you guys and I would have
wished to implement the things as.

But we seem to be differing when we hit a rare post that talks about
say "erdogan", The Turkish Prime Minister.

Here I say, that "erdogan" is supposed to be a tag. You guys say, no,
you started out as hierarchical, so you've got to keep it that way,
thus it's got to be a cat.
I say, yes, but how practical is it to have 100s of sub cats such as
"obama", "blair", "bush".

Or...

you guys say, why not implement the whole thing as with tags then?
I say, yes, but I want to use a "custom taxonomy" for the very reason
that cus. taxonomies exist! That is, to bring a law & order in terms
of context.

Then you guys say, O.K. then, keep the "People" as  a cus. tax, also keep it as
hierarchical=true, and add "politicians" as a sub cat under it, but...
use the "good old tags" and add "erdogan" or "obama" as a tag.

I say, ABSOLUTELY NO.

WHY? Because the term "obama" would have missed its context.
Obama as what? A Politician?, A celebrity?, A Democrat?,

See, at this level, if the term we are dealing with was not "obama"
but one of those words in English which has double meaning such as
the over beaten example "apple", then what?.

So you do need taga, you do need custom taxonomies.. and you do need
hierarchial=true!

But you cannot.

What starts out perfectly as a hierarchical =true custom taxonomy
runs out of steam in a few sub cats down to road and starts calling
help from tags. and there is only lone tag taxonomy there to help
you., the good old ones. And from that point on, you'd need
programming to pull the rest off.

Would it be better right there and then, to log that item as a
tag under some sub of a custom tax?

You guys are saying that just because I happened to choose
hierarchial=true for that custom taxonomy, I should be stuck all the
way down!  ; no matter how granular and how absolutely a tag-like the
item becomes? I'm sorry, but i'm unable to comprehend the wisdom behind it.

I see the point of view in your explanations as to why
"hierarchial=true" works the
way it is now, but I completely and strongly disagree that it is
supposed to be kept that way. I think sooner or later, that is going
to change.

Some of you see the need for the case I'm trying to establish and
suggested this as a plug in functionality, you  saw the need but saw
it a "too=specific". Well, maybe that's due to the unimaginable
odd-numbers/even-numbers example which I accept as.. yes it was terrible.
I should have given a more down-to-earth example. But, no problem. The
case is so applicable we can build another case in no time.

Start out with "places" taxonomy for instance.

And soon, you'd be introducing "museums" as a sub. and maybe another
sub as say "churches" and then another say, "stadiums". Soon, you will
see that this is it. You see that you are only working one level deep
from the "places"
top level and the "musuems", "churches", "stadiums" are all subs and all
are siblings. Now, you know you are done as far as
"hierarchical=true". And when you get a new post relates to a museum
for instance, you guys and I go different routes.

I say, it would be easier and more meaningful to go ahead & click on
"museums" and in the text box appearing underneath, I'd add the
musuem's name as a tag!.

I hear now you are asking me why not screw the whole hierarchical=true
and instead, go
with hierarchical=false, and add both the "museums" and that museum's
name as tags?  I hear that question.

But do you hear me when I ask what's wrong with having some context to
tags while still enjoying all the hierarchical power which comes with
hierarchical=true?

Otto, you could not help me explain it better when you said this;

"Hierarchical taxonomies are generally used for very well-defined
broad sets of things. Categories, basically. The point being that
often these categories are predefined and you are simply picking them
from a list. " >that's point 1

And you contrasted this with tags very nicely by saying;

"Tags are created on the fly, by definition they don't need hierarchy
because they are not well-defined sets of terms to put into
hierarchical structures. " >and that's your point 2

And you also mentioned;

"Custom taxonomies are there to allow you to create groups of related
terms. " >that's point 3

All three points are exactly right and I couldn't agree more. And yet,
I completely disagree with your conclusions on the final syntesis.

Think of it this way for a sec.

"obama", "blair" and tons of many others can easily be grouped as
"politicians", thus the need for "politicians" as a group, as a
category.  ( And this satisfies your point 1 )

"obama", "blair", "washington" are to be "created on the fly" and
therefore, they got to be tags. (this satisfies your point 2)

And finally,

Since you do not want your tag "washington" to be interpreted within a
"places..state" context, you bring custom taxonomies to plate so
that "washington" is interpreted within  "people/politicians" context.
( And this satisfies your point 3 )

In your reply, you've asked;

"But I still don't see the point of it. What is the purpose? What is it that
fundamentally changes by having tags in a hierarchy, exactly?"

Think of it this way please.

Wouldn't it be nice & easy for both the developers and the site
visitors to pull something like the following?

<b>People: </b>
<a href='get all the politicians posts under the people
taxonomy'>Politicians</a<>,
<a href='get all the obama posts under the people taxonomy'>obama</a>"

It's easy on the developer, and perfectly makes sense for the visitor.

I dunno how else to make this point any further. I see all pure power
and convenience in this, with absolutely no harm at all and no
specifics to no particular case at all.

If this was available, millions of people would have used it.

That's all I can and will say. :) Final.

Wow, OK, I didn't get completely through that, but here's my two cents:

The built-in standard tags and categories are fine for most use cases, in my opinion. Built-in capabilities for custom taxonomies are good for most other cases. If you're still not satisfied, I'd suggest building a custom meta box, or use Wikipedia-style naming ? as in, apple (fruit) and apple (computer)

Subject: Re: [wp-hackers] hierarchical custom taxonomies vs good & old cats.

I will try to use you guys' ***your own words*** -  to be on the same page...

Take a ***well defined broad cat.*** PEOPLE. Let's add sub to it. "POLITICIANS".
That's perfect, because it is ***more specific*** than PEOPLE thus the
reasoning for another ***well defined broad*** group under PEOPLE.

So we got People > Politicians so far. For the same token, we can
perfectly introduce "Movie Stars". And we all know how that would go in;
that is another sub-cat under the "People" taxonomy, as a sibling to
"politicians".

So far, there is no problem in the way you guys and I would have
wished to implement the things as.

But we seem to be differing when we hit a rare post that talks about
say "erdogan", The Turkish Prime Minister.

Here I say, that "erdogan" is supposed to be a tag. You guys say, no,
you started out as hierarchical, so you've got to keep it that way,
thus it's got to be a cat.
I say, yes, but how practical is it to have 100s of sub cats such as
"obama", "blair", "bush".

Or...

you guys say, why not implement the whole thing as with tags then?
I say, yes, but I want to use a "custom taxonomy" for the very reason
that cus. taxonomies exist! That is, to bring a law & order in terms
of context.

Then you guys say, O.K. then, keep the "People" as  a cus. tax, also keep it as

Okay, the problem here is that you've gone too specific. You wouldn't
define People->Politicians->Obama in a sane taxonomy. You might define
People->Politicians, but that's as far as you'd go with it. Obama is a
specific instance, whereas your taxonomy contains things that are
broad categories (specifically, "People" and "Politicians"). Adding
"Obama" to it doesn't make any sense.

Let's say your taxonomy is "people". In that case, yes, it would
absolutely make sense to add obama to it, probably as a tag. But it
would not make sense to add "politicians" to that taxonomy.

A taxonomy is a group of like terms. And that's important: LIKE terms.
"obama" is not like "politicians", because "obama" is a specific thing
while "politicians" is a group of things.


> WHY? Because the term "obama" would have missed its context.
> Obama as what? A Politician?, A celebrity?, A Democrat?,

The problem is that you're trying to cram too much into one space. You
want your taxonomy to not only contain the terms for the specific
items, but also to contain the groupings of those items.

However, taxonomies are themselves groups of items. If you want to
define "people" and "politicians" as separate taxonomies, then you
could fit Obama into both. But it doesn't make any sense to try to fit
both groups and very specific things within those groups into the same
taxonomy.

And the reason that this doesn't make sense is that really, what
you're doing is applying those terms to posts. A post might be about
politicians. It might be about Obama. It might also be about movie
stars. But those are not all types of people. Some of them are types
of people, and some of them are specific people.

No, we're saying that your initial choice to put two entirely
different things into the same taxonomy was incorrect in the first
place.

Create a "people" taxonomy - non-hierarchical. Then use it to type in
the names of the people as needed.
Then, create a "people-group" taxonomy, hierarchical. Then define your
groups of people, like politicians, movie-stars, etc.

Both of them can be used to apply to your posts.

Not necessarily. Your example is poor, basically, because yes, that
one has one distinct level of hierarchy imaginable to it. But not all
things or categories are the same way. It's quite possible to go from
broad to more specific without getting into single instances.

Why not create a museums taxonomy instead? Why are you making the
taxonomies themselves so broad? Places. People. I imagine you might
want to have everything under one taxonomy: Things. ;)

But categories don't apply to those, because they are not posts.

Terms in taxonomies actually get applied to posts, not to other terms.
So yes, you can define obama and blair as being in a group, but the
way you group terms is by wrapping a taxonomy around them. Not
wrapping them up inside another term.

No, that wouldn't make any sense, because your taxonomy is too broad.
This makes more sense:

<b>People: </b>
<a href='get all the politicians posts under the people-group
taxonomy'>Politicians</a>,
<a href='get all the obama posts under the people taxonomy'>obama</a>

Because, again, terms apply to posts. Politicians and Obama are both
"People", but they are not the same "type" as each other, and so
shouldn't be in the same taxonomy.

Hi there,

have any of you guys discussed about adding the possibility to use php
anonymous functions [1] with the hooks?

I mean something like:

add_filter('the_title', function($title) { return '<b>'. $title. '</b>'; });

instead of declaring a function and passing its name as a paramenter to
add_filter and add_action.

What you think about it?

I think its generally frowned upon, because if you add an anonymous
function, then you have no way of removing it, other than calling
remove_all_filters.

There are also concerns about memory leaks caused by using lambda functions
in php. The add_filter code you cited would create a new function every time
it was called, which may not be a big deal in your case (you're not likely
to trigger the title filter more than 20-50 times in any one page), but
would still be slightly less efficient than defining the function once.

That's a common misconception. PHP will evaluate it only once. It will
internally create separate instances of Closure objects if there is a 'use'
clause.

Agreed.

Sure, I've seen anonymous functions used in some valid callback functions.

The only time I've seen lambda used with hooks was to mask a malware 
infestation.  So it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

I'd much rather see straight forward code than clever/tricky code in the 
plugins and themes I review.

Then I can be sure I know that both me an the original author know 
exactly what the code is really going to do.

As has been said elsewhere in the thread it is possible since WP3.0

It's not recommended though - any dynamic function creation isn't as it doesn't play well with object caches, being removed by other plugins, and is hard to security audti

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=pQtRyxXc4euvjDv4zmG2GQ2eFvFKvuUipMt0v@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone can register to this blog and add meta data from this plugin,
so before releasing, I need to tighten it up...

Where I have the plugin saving to meta_data, I have:

add_filter( 'my_filter', 'wp_kses_post'  );
add_filter( 'my_filter', 'wptexturize'   );
add_filter( 'my_filter', 'convert_chars' );

and:

$output = apply_filters( 'my_filter', $input );

My question is, do I need a esc_html() on those also, and am I running
those in the right order? I've tested and it appears to be working
(except wptexturize only does the ? version of quotes, so somethings
busted.)

I also have a url field which I'm running:

$output = str_replace("http://", "", esc_url_raw( $input, array('http') ))

before saving and on output in the theme, I manually put the http://
back in. Is that enough to be safe or should it have the above
filters?

I've been searching though the source all day, and as far as I can
tell, kses don't seem to be run on the_content for example (that I
could find). As you can tell, this is all relatively new to me. Thanks
for your help,
Ken

How would you hook a function directly (including $args) without

Generalizing here: sanitization should be done on save, and escaping on
display.

So you'll want to run kses, absint, esc_url_raw, sanitize_text_field, what
have you, on save. Then, use esc_url, esc_html along wiht texturization or
whatever else you need, what have you, on output. There may be use cases for
running kses on display. We do it in some instances. But as long as the data
is safe going in, it's going to be safe coming out. (And if it isn't, then
you have a larger problem.)

General tips are the best! I was going about it trying to stuff
everything in on save, so I'll break that up the way you suggest (it
does make more sense that way I suppose). The files I've been reading
are mainly default-filters.php and kses.php while the sanitize_*
functions are scattered about everywhere. (I had at some point known
about the sanitize* functions but then got distracted in the kses,
absint, esc_url_raw and forgot about them :-\ )

Reading 'sanitize_text_field()' it looks like the sanitize functions
call kses functions so I guess I don't need to call it twice.
(although, paranoia prompts me to want to stack every one I can find
onto the input save :-D )

What I've got so far should get me going though, thanks Andrew!

Hi everybody,

I'm writing a plugin that, among the options, has a text field where the 
user needs to add some HTML text. So I was looking into adding a few 
simple quicktags on top of the textarea to make things easier. I found 
out that there's some undocumented (?) WP code to do that [see below], 
but I'm not able to make it work. Could someone please point me to the 
right direction?

Thank you and happy holidays,
Dino.

Code:

<?php wp_print_scripts( 'quicktags' ); ?>

<script type="text/javascript">
// Customize the list of quicktags to show
edButtons = new Array(
  new edButton('ed_strong','b','<strong>','</strong>',''),
  new edButton('ed_link','link','','</a>','')
);
</script>

<script type="text/javascript"> edToolbar(); edCanvas = 
document.getElementById('container');</script>

<textarea name="options[container]" id="container" cols="70" 
rows="5">blah blah</textarea>

Message-ID: <AANLkTin8RASr6U5f_tp6VtTL2ZUGTfhj4t8SjErYXW_q@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I am trying to modernize a rather old Plugin, part of which includes
updating the Plugin options to use the Settings API properly, and to ensure
that all user data are sanitized and validated properly.

To that end, I have two user settings, one raw CSS and the other a URL query
string, that I am somewhat unsure if I'm sanitizing properly. I'm passing
the raw CSS through wp_filter_nohtml_kses() and the URL query string through
urlencode().

I have a third user setting that is a TLA, selected from a known, finite
array of TLAs. I'm sanitizing this setting as follows:


$valid_translations = implode( '|', array_keys( $scripturizer_translations )
);

 $valid_input['default_translation'] = ( strpos( $valid_translations,
$input['default_translation'] ) !== false ? $input['default_translation'] :
$scripturizer_options_default['default_translation'] );

Where $scripturizer_translations is the array of TLAs.

With all three, am I on the right track? The wrong track? Is there a
better/more-preferred way to sanitize such data?

Thanks,

Chip

>>Okay, the problem here is that you've gone too specific. You wouldn't
define People->Politicians->Obama in a sane taxonomy. You might define
People->Politicians, but that's as far as you'd go with it. [That's point X]

Yes absolutely.


>>Obama is a specific instance, whereas your taxonomy contains things that are
broad categories.

Thats's right as well.

>>Let's say your taxonomy is "people". In that case, yes, it would
absolutely make sense to add obama to it, probably as a tag. But it
would not make sense to add "politicians" to that taxonomy.

That's also right.

>>A taxonomy is a group of like terms. And that's important: LIKE terms.
"obama" is not like "politicians", because "obama" is a specific thing
while "politicians" is a group of things.

Otto, that is true. but that's in theory. At the end of the day, don't
we want this though?

<b>People: </b>
<a href='get all the politicians posts under the people-group
taxonomy'>Politicians</a>,
<a href='get all the obama posts under the people taxonomy'>obama</a>

Cleanly written that's basically

------------------------------------
People: Politicians, Obama
------------------------------------

where both Politicians and Obama is clickable to pull the proper posts
under the proper context. that's all there is to it. isn't it? the
point is how do we make easy for the people, the developers, the
average developers.

"People: Politicians, Obama" is what the joe the user, sees. Joe does
not care about what was a tag under the hood , or what came thru a
hierarchial taxonomy or what not. He clicks and go.
The internal stuff is for us & wp to worry about. Looking from this
angle, the question is what UI is needed to pull this off in the most
intuitive way.
That was my precise goal in discussing this thread. It made sense to
me to  implement it so that all the developer does is to crete a
hierarchial taxonomy called People and then throw proper terms under
it such as "Politicians","Musicians" etc and whenever he needs to tag
a post (with say M. Jackson, he goes straight into the
People/Musicians taxonomy, and  clicks on the musicians, lets the WP
open the textbox, and tags the item(s) such as
M.Jackson,R.Stewart,Madonna in one go like that. I thought, with that
approach, hw would end up doing 2 things in one shot.

1- classify the post as people/politicians custom taxonomy.
2- tag the post under politicians taxonomy.

Now, this action may appear to confuse you in understanding what I'm
saying and thus you can make the remarks you did with point X at the
top of this message - which I completely agree. In theory, you are
VERY VERY TRUE.

But if the UI I'm suggesting is going to do the following behind the
scenes, can we say we are on the same page?

WP creates "Musicians" taxonomy, ( that is on the fly and with
hierarchial=false ) and add Michael and Rod to it.

So, it is a UI issue. But I think it is a benefit to all.

Agree?

-and BTW, thanks to all who put up with me in these long treads.

Not in the case of sanitize_text_field(). That function is to sanitize text.
kses is to sanitize HTML. I'm simplifying this here, of course, but here:

So, you'd use sanitize_text_field() if you don't expect HTML at all in the
input. It doesn't call kses at all, just strips a whole lot of bad stuff.
(It does use a kses utility function in the process, but only to make sure
it doesn't destroy content in the process.)

You'd use kses if you are receiving HTML (a perfect example would be a
comment; in practice this will typically be textareas) and need to make sure
that nothing malicious is getting in. Thus a whitelist of HTML, attributes,
and values.

But that's a matter of how you display things, not a matter of
internal organization. If you want to have your theme/plugin/code
display items from both people-group and people in the same line, you
can do that. But you wouldn't want them in the same taxonomy, because
they are not the same type of things.

If you're just going to throw a bunch of random things into a taxonomy
without an organizational principle behind it, then why have separate
custom taxonomies at all?

That's a matter of UI, like you stated before. And I would have
Musicians and Politicians and such as separate taxonomies. Perhaps
with taxonomy meta data you could group the separate taxonomies
together somehow for a user interface. We don't taxonomy-meta yet, but
there's no real reason you couldn't make another taxonomy to group
those taxonomies, if you really wanted to do something like that. Or
use an option. Or whatever makes the most sense for your
implementation.

It seems *really* custom to me. I'm not seeing a lot of wide use-cases
here for it. But custom taxonomies are relatively new too, so we'll
have to see how they get used in the long term.

Message-ID: <AANLkTik7Px+p2Bzo9pfAdc_YbNA7azqB7TFDkbo+eYru@mail.gmail.com>

Here's a silly question:
Does case matter in .Org usernames? (Evidence points to: "emphatic
yes".) I was trying to log in to the Support fora using Google Chrome
just now and it seems as though Chrome forces usernames to be lower
case, yet my .Org username has capital letters in it. So, no joy in
Mudville on Chrome. I guess "ZaMoose" and "zamoose" are considered to
be two separate accounts, right?

So, long and the short of it is: what can be done to allow me to use
the fora + Chrome? Can I somehow associate the lower-cased version of
the user name with my existing account, or am I just out of luck?

Two things:
1) I just successfully tested using capital letters in a username on the
Support Forums using Google Chrome.  It had no issues with the capital
letters (it did not force the username to be lowercase) ... so you're
running in to some other issue there.

2) I'm concerned that usernames are not case insensitive.  My username is
"ericmann" ... but someone could have "Ericmann" or "EricMann"?  This could
cause some serious identity issues if people intentionally copy usernames
... have we always been case sensitive in the forums, or is this a result of
a previous update?

Hi all

I have yet to find a working solution to have a custom post type with an upload field in it that uses the media library. Does anyone know of one?

I am developing a plugin that at the moment uses it's own table to store info that includes media but I think it would be wise if possible to use a custom post type. Would you agree? It does feel a bit like custom post types are still a little young so maybe I should just stick with a separate table?

I also read that custom post types with meta use a join, which makes sense. However pulling all the info from one custom table would seem to me to be more efficient. Thoughts?

Thank you

Andy

Usernames have case, but are not case-sensitive.

Hmm.. If I log in under Firefox with bad case, then I get the same
thing. I think Chrome is doing something tricky to hide it from me.

Anyway, yes, bbPress is case sensitive:

Scratch that.  The following usernames will allow me to log in:

   - ericmann
   - Ericmann
   - ERICMANN

I also did a quick test, and it appears that it's only strange camel casing
that breaks the login:

   - EricMann does not work
   - ericmanN does not work

So there's some inconsistency with the system ...

Subject: [wp-hackers] Archive Widget for Custom Post Types?
Message-ID: <0A3F379B-EF88-4B8C-8224-35492BF99D24@anca.tv>

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to create a widget that provides the same archives functionality as the one included with basic WordPress, but lets the user choose which post type archive to display.  

I looked around in the default-widgets.php file for how the archive widget is built, and it looks to use the function "wp_get_archives", which applies the "getarchives_where" filter and returns a list of archives by date.

As per track #13462 (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13462) we are supposed to use this filter to achieve the result of listing the archives for custom post types, but I'm trying to figure out how to make this work only when this code is being called from within my widget.

Do I register the filter in my widget class file?  Or is there something else I'm missing?

Thanks,

Anca.

Yes, you add the filter when displaying the widget and then you should
probably remove it.

Something like this:

class My_Widget {
  private $current_instance;

  function widget( $instance ) {
    ...
    $this->current_instance = $instance;

    add_filter( 'getarchives_where', array($this, 'getarchives_where') );
    wp_get_archives();
    remove_filter( 'getarchives_where', array($this, 'getarchives_where') );
  }

  function getarchives_where( $sql ) {
    // Do something with $this->current_instance['post_type']
  }
}

I would find this very useful as well. Any plugins that devs could flag as
'best practice'?

I did hear a while back that somebody was going to create a dummy plugin for
this very reason?

akismet or any other Automattic built plugins would probably be a great start.

I've been evolving my plugin style a lot since WordPress Answers launched as I have been answering lots of questions over there. I'm sure others on this list will prefer their own styles which will likely conflict with mine but I'll explain what I've come up with as I'm really satisfied with it in case it can help you:

Basically I use a class to encapsulate with a static function "on_load()" that I call immediately after the class definition. The on_load() function then add all hooks (all actions and all filters) and I use static functions for those hooks since there is no real need for instance functions (having an instance hanging taking up a name in the global namespace just to enable you to wire up hooks was something I wanted to avoid.)

I typically name the functions the same name as the hook but with a prefix of "action_" or "filter_" as appropriate, i.e. static function action_init() handles the 'init' action hook.  (Following those conventions I've actually written code that will wire up all the hooks in the class with single call to a helper function in on_load(), but I haven't started using that in my production code yet nor have I show an example of it on WordPress Answers.)

So for the most part I'm using all static functions for the class that wraps the hooks for a plugin, but I will also use instances of classes if there is a need for them. Still using instances of class is an approaches you can use for any PHP code and thus is not specific to WordPress plugin best practices. Of course I don't think my plugin coding style will work with PHP4 so bear that in mind.

If you want to see the coding style this answer gives a good example of what I was just explaining (sans the auto-wireup of the hooks):

http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/5750/#5778

Hope this helps.

Interesting. When I registered my username way back in the day, I
registered it CamelCase -- i.e., ZaMoose. Trac, etc. take the
lowercased username just fine, but the forums don't.

Additionally, the reason Chrome doesn't seem to be working appears to
be in their implementation of form auto-complete. Even if I enter
"ZaMoose", since it has a password saved for "zamoose" at
wordpress.org, it will automatically downcase the username and cause
my login to fail. (This is Chrome on a Mac -- I don't know whether
Windows and Linux versions are thus-afflicted.)

Actually, I haven't seen that exact problem since I don't store passwords in
Chrome (I use it on a shared machine and I don't want anyone but me to have
my passwords - particularly since Chrome will show them in plaintext if you
know where to look).  But you did point out a larger issue; namely that some
forms of capitalization/camelcase will work with usernames and others will
fail.

Different systems are case sensitive and others are not. Basically, it's a pain.

If you haven't noticed... SVN is case-sensitive about usernames too.

The bottom line is to pick a spelling and stick with it. Always using
all lowercase usernames helps. Wish I had done that starting out. :)

 I had an issue a few months back where .org killed some whitespace at the end of a password (stored in 1Password so I had no idea since it always worked on .org) but Track didn't like it and failed on login. Took me a while to sort it and a discussion on IRC with @nacin. The differing systems do make for some odd issues.

Chrome on OS X stores passwords in the keychain, so unless you know
the keychain password, you can't see the stored passwords, so it's not
as much of an issue in Happy Macland.

What can I say? I was young, inexperienced, and fresh off a turn on a
Java programming stint, so CamelCasingEverything JustMadeSense.

Alas and alack.

Actually, come to think of it, is there a way to correct my previous
stupidity and get my .Org username downcased permanently?

lower_case_z_and_m_dangit(), if you please!

I generally look at plugins developed by core developers. Often  
they're very well documented so you know what's going on.

An example would be Andrew Nacin's Log Deprecated Notices: http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/log-deprecated-notices

This is a problem with a plugin, not with the WordPress core, so the  
plugin author should be contacted.

But, as Andrew Nacin has said before on the WP-Hackers list, security  
vulnerabilities should be reported to security at wordpress.org, never to  
the general public.

Correct. security at wordpress.org or plugins at wordpress.org is the proper venue
here.

The patch you suggest on your site is NOT secure. It does nothing at all to
make the plugin more secure.

You should use wp_nonce_field() with check_admin_referrer() (and other
related functions) to properly secure forms from CSRF.

Just don't use any of the terrible, terrible cheap hacks found in that
plugin. Do as I say, not as I do, or something like that. :-)

Most of the time, look at the author. Plugins by any core developer (Mark,
Peter, Dion...), Otto, Ozh, scribu, Austin (filosofo), Jon (duck_), and many
others will all be solid plugins that are well-written (and usually
well-documented.)

The GeoLocation plugin is great to look at for security ideas. It 
actually has working examples of a majority of the standard WordPress 
plugin security techniques.  I was so impressed I wrote a review of it here:
http://thecodecave.com/2010/06/22/wordpress-security-a-plugin-done-right/

Among other techniques it shows an example of wp_nonce_field()'s brutish 
older brother wp_create_nonce() and their OCD companion wp_verify_nonce().

If you want to be a test case, sure. :)

The problem is that while I can easily change your username for
WordPress and bbPress, I can't be sure that it will change it
everywhere. I don't know how the SVN authentication hookup works, and
whether or not it has your username stored elsewhere. Or if trac will
be particularly happy about it. And god only knows what MediaWiki will
do...

I was able to duplicate this on several installs.

1. Create a Taxonomy and assign it to only attachment:image
2. wp-admin/media.php?attachment_id= no longer shows the taxonomy.
3. Edit Post  wp-admin/media-upload.php?post_id= iFrame no longer shows the taxonomy
4. The taxonomy listing page in the front end returns no results.

The patch on that ticket should cause your taxonomy to show in media-upload
and media.php. Unfortunately I'd need to see your code for the taxonomy
listing page to debug further -- what's the code, and what's the URL that
isn't working? (Are you setting up rewrite rules and failing to flush the
permalinks?)

This guy is hosting his own sites on his own setup. He's blaming the

Is it possible to replace the category filter with a custom taxonomy

taxonomy counties, can I allow people to filter in /edit.php? 
post_type=town based on counties?

Hey Will,
It is possible, and we did it like this for Assignment Desk:

Let me know if you have specific questions

Subject: [wp-hackers] Avoid query_post on frontpage on wp initialization
Message-ID: <CF07A1C7-0ACE-4B07-8365-48B7169B6D9C@gmail.com>

Hi,

we are running on a pretty big WP database with a very large posts table with ~500k entries in the posts table. When going to the front page of the blog a query to the wp_posts table is made during WP initialization. This default query on the big table takes ~1sec. The data returned by this query is not required afterwards, so I'd like to avoid doing it. 

In wp->main() the query_posts() is always executed and I don't seem to have very much control of what is queried in there. I'd like to avoid querying anything at this stage at all. Later on in the page flow I'll query the database differently. Any idea?

Thank you,
Martin

Hi Martin,

Yes, there are unfortunately no hooks to disable running of the first query.  I seem to remember it being one of my first trac tickets (though I can't find it now) though it didn't get any traction.

For the longest time I was at a lost for how to resolve the issue without hacking core and recently I think I identified a solution.  If you subclass the WP class you can bypass the get_posts() function for the root, or call the standard one otherwise.  Here's some code to try.I haven't fully tested it but it should get you started:

class WP2 extends WP {
  static function on_load($extra_query_vars = '') {
    add_action('setup_theme',array(__CLASS__,'action_setup_theme'));
  }
  static function action_setup_theme() { // Setup theme is the first code run after WP is created.
    global $wp;
    $wp = new WP2();  // Replace the global $wp
  }
  function get_posts($query_args = '') {
    list($path) = explode('?',$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
    if ($path=='/') 
      return array();
    else
      return parent::get_posts($query_args); // Delegate to WP class
  }
}
WP2::on_load();

Hope this helps.

-Mike
P.S. Let me know how it goes...

I was able to cancel the initial query with this code in the active
theme's functions.php file:

function cancel_first_query() {
	remove_filter('posts_request', 'cancel_first_query');
	return '';
}
add_filter('posts_request', 'cancel_first_query');

Relevant to this discussion are the adorable and useful __return_* functions
that were added in 3.0. They give you standardized ways of disabling hooks
that just need a false or zero returned without creating a new function.

Efficient and hilarious, they also offer a scalable and elegant model for
situations they don't account for. Just generalize your special needs as
much as possible and create you're own __return_* functions.

Here they are from wp-includes/functions.php

/**
 * Returns true
 *
 * Useful for returning true to filters easily
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
 * @see __return_false()
 * @return bool true
 */
function __return_true() {
    return true;
}

/**
 * Returns false
 *
 * Useful for returning false to filters easily
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
 * @see __return_true()
 * @return bool false
 */
function __return_false() {
    return false;
}

/**
 * Returns 0
 *
 * Useful for returning 0 to filters easily
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
 * @see __return_zero()
 * @return int 0
 */
function __return_zero() {
    return 0;
}

/**
 * Returns an empty array
 *
 * Useful for returning an empty array to filters easily
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
 * @see __return_zero()
 * @return array Empty array
 */
function __return_empty_array() {
    return array();
}

Simply extending the WP class would indeed be the right way to do this.

Message-ID: <F2A09F3D-9418-49C3-A08D-CCFE6E90A0D7@newclarity.net>

Hi all,

I'm having a discussion over WordPress Answers in the comments for this question[1] about the use of the taxonomy system for classifying items other than posts such as users, comments, postmeta, etc. I had been thinking it was a foregone conclusion that the taxonomy system was designed to be used with more than just posts but the fact that someone is making some good points to question that logic is making me question it too.

OTOH one of his arguments I still don't agree with is "If there are no functions to support the use of taxonomy for items other than posts then it's better to create new tables."

Can anyone speak to if 1.) the taxonomy system was actually designed with more than posts in mind,  2.) if anyone is using the taxonomy system successfully to classify items other than posts, and 3.) if anyone can comment on if adding new tables vs. reusing the existing taxonomy tables is more appropriate and why? 

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using Taxonomy for Users, Comments, Post Meta, etc?

Taxonomy is generic. It can apply to anything.

Specifically, you can use wp_set_object_terms to assign an integer
(the object ID) to have a term in a given taxonomy. Similarly, you can
use wp_get_object_terms to get the data back, and so forth. However,
all you're really doing is to give an ID number a relationship to a
term (in a taxonomy). How you interpret that relationship is up to
you. If you want to use user_id's, then by all means, go for it. I've
used it for exactly that.

That said, taxonomies are mostly geared towards posts, in the sense
that a lot of the post query code lets you select based on
relationships between post ID's and terms. That's the main use case.
If you want to, say, select comments with a given term on them, then
you're probably going to be rolling your own SQL for now to select
those comments.

At wp.org, we use taxonomies to assign users certain terms for the
purpose of the email subscriptions. When you subscribe to a thread, a
term created for that thread in a special taxonomy get a relationship
to the user ID. When it comes time to send an email, a query is done
to get all the users associated with that term. Similar behavior is
used for the "tag" subscriptions.

Subject: [wp-hackers] The problem with Contributions and This Thread
Message-ID: <AANLkTim0DuAg3+1xb7B9SQiUO5c37+=811Q6BOcqBWwn@mail.gmail.com>

Thread in Question:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/what-should-2011-hold-for-wordpress

The Point In A Nutshell: WordPress is community driven, meaning I write a
patch and it is either debated, audited, tested, committed or any
combination. Someone saying, "I want this feature or this feature," has
never mattered, unless there is a patch or a lead developer jumps on and
develops the feature. Given the limited amount of lead developers and the
allocated time they have, much of what goes into WordPress has historically
been from the community.

The thread is a waste of time, since as a contributor, unless I care about
what some Joe writes on a thread or what some ticket is in Trac, I'm going
to do my own thing. This is true even if I write a patch for one of those
thread features or for some ticket on Trac.

The Problem:

The basis for setting a roadmap is for planning features. If WordPress.org
is going to continue along the path of planned features, then its release
cycle will need to be extended or allow for features to incubate until they
are ready for inclusion in core.

In a community based development, the planned features has been and will
always be what contributors decide. It is great to say, we want feature A,
B, and C. The problem, at least from my point-of-view is that saying, "Well,
this isn't on the roadmap, so it isn't going to get in," causes a clash of
reality. WordPress.org Foundation or Automattic or the Lead Developers want
feature A, B, C, etc, then have them work on it full time.

Having a roadmap for Lead developers is great, but the development cycle
requires accepting features from outside the lead developers and roadmap.

Problems I'm Seeing Personally:

* Weekly IRC Chats are limited to Agenda.

I can't count how many times I wanted to bring something up and be told that
I may not. Hello, potential and former contributor speaking here, if I'm
wanting attention for a feature that has been ignored and is tested and
commit ready, then where am I supposed to bring this up? On Trac, I'm
ignored, in WP-Hackers, I'm ignored partly because of the noise and partly
because very few lead developers participate of any real time to the
threads.

* Lead Developers for some reason have been limited to a certain scope
within the development of WordPress.

So basically, I'm relying on a lead developer whom I must receive blessing
from and must rely on their time, input, and commit to my issue. For me
personally, I've given up on ever getting my patches in that area committed.
In fact, I'd rather you removed my patches, even the tested and commit ready
ones, because I'm no longer going to be updating or supporting them based on
feedback.

If you want me to contribute, then I need less, "This isn't in my job area,
therefore I'm not going to help you," and more, "Well this has been tested
and is ready to go."

Really, it reminds me of my first patch, where I had a hell of time trying
to get a lead developer to even look at the issue let alone get someone to
even commit the fix. I was almost never going to contribute to WordPress
again after that. This time it is even worse, because I'm depending on not 5
to 7 lead developers to find time to look at my patch and commit it, but
one. One that doesn't appear to be interested and thus, I'm SOL.

* Corporate Attitude and Coordination in Community Driven Development.

Okay, I must say that this appears to work fine in Apache projects, Zend
Framework. However, I'm seeing similar problems creep up that CodeIgniter
community was / is having. People are / were leaving that project, because
their contributions weren't being made into the project fast enough. They
are solving that in part by splitting the development off in a community
driven (unstable) and a company driven (stable) branches. Similar, I might
add to Zend Framework, in that they have an incubation period for new
components.

The desire to have a community driven development requires the openness to
accept patches outside the limited scope of planned features. Not only
limiting to defect fixes, but also enhancements and features. Unless a lead
developer desires to spend the time working on a feature himself or herself,
then the community will determine what they work on based on variable
factors and some won't even realize or care that there is a planned list or
roadmap.

Telling a potential or existing contributor to bugger off will lose points
and potentially lose contributors.

* Contributors have projects, a life, a job, etc too.

Respecting the time of the contributor also must be weighed as well. I
realize that lead developers have their own projects, their own time
commitments, their own life, etc. What needs to be weighed, always, is the
contributor time factors as well. As it has been since the beginning, the
time I devoted to WordPress.org has pushed other projects to the wayside. I
must weigh contributing to WordPress.org verses working on my own web site,
my own projects. If a patch is brushed aside, my commitment to WordPress is
diminished. Continue this trend over time, and I will all together stop
contributing.

* I might be the biggest Jerk on the Earth.

Respect. Learn it, live it.

If I'm being a jerk, it is most often because I'm angry about something. If
I'm a contributor, then do find out what it is and if my attitude is
unwarranted, then take appropriate action. If I'm shown respect first and
foremost no matter how bad I act, then I will shape up or move out. If not,
then follow Poisonous People and respectfully ask that the person to not be
part of the community.

Losing one jerk is not a big deal. Not being able to tell who the jerk is a
problem.

* As a contributor, All I Care About is my patch

This might not be true for the major contributors, but one thing I've
witnessed triaging Trac is that this should be considered a rule, if it
isn't already. When there were 3 active lead developers and the patch load
was heavy and personal features were being worked on, many patches went
stale. Many original patch contributors moved on after several weeks or
months.

In a project where there are possibility 2 contributors for every 1 that
leaves (a hyperbole by the way, it is more or less closer to 1.05 to 1.25),
meh, it doesn't matter. One leaves and another replaces. That is part of
what makes WordPress.org great.

* I Should Never Have to Beg

If this needs an explanation, then you fail.

The only time I should need to follow-up on a patch or ticket, is when there
is feedback saying that the patch doesn't work or isn't commit ready with
some reason why.


Jacob Santos

PS: I have been wanting to write this for a long time, but I always feel
that I'm off-base doing so. My experiences surely is not representative of
the whole? However, what might have been a minor problem years ago, has in
my opinion escalated. I have seen others give up being a contributor and
seen the reasons behind it.

I know Jane Wells means well and I believe she is coming at this from a
corporate point-of-view. However, I'm surprised at the corporate attitudes.
Is this a community project and if so, then meritocracy should not be part
of it or at least have a concise definition for WordPress Foundation.

PSS: It appears being part of the meritocracy does not include dissent and
being a jerk (if even a little), so if you fall into either one of those
categories, then you need not apply.

I think you misread the statement. The roadmap is an overall vision for 
the year, priorities etc, not a feature list. Feature lists will be 
decided on a release-by-release basis as they have been in the past 
based on a combination of user demand, lead dev priority, and someone 
being interested in coding it.

Something being tested and commit ready from one person's perspective is 
not always the same as another's. Also, if someone writes a patch that 
serves their needs but not the overall plan for the application, things 
don't just get committed because someone wants them to be. It needs to 
get consensus from the project leads that it's the right thing for the 
overall user base. There are lead devs in teh irc channel almost 24/7. 
The once a week product team meeting with an agenda is not the only time 
to talk to them in irc.

Yes. That is the structure of the WordPress core development process 
right now.

The whole point of community development is that many people contribute 
to patches and one person isn't responsible for a patch or feature 
indefinitely.

You said in your last big post that you didn't intend to contribute 
anymore. Have you changed your mind? It seems like you have been making 
this threat the whole two years I've known you. I hate to see anyone 
leave the project, but if it's been making you unhappy for that long, 
then yeah, I would completely understand you finding another project to 
spend your time on. Life is short. Too short to spend a lot of time 
working on something that just makes you angry all the time.

> If I'm shown respect first and
> foremost no matter how bad I act, then I will shape up or move out.
You know what? No. It's up to EVERYONE to show respect. Take 
responsibility for this. Saying people who are working crazy hours 
should be go out of their way to appease one person "no matter how bad I 
act" means you think you are more important than everyone else. Respect 
begets respect. Everyone needs to be polite, not just the lead devs.
> I know Jane Wells means well and I believe she is coming at this from a

I'm not sure what exactly about me you find corporate. I'm a non-profit 
girl since way back in my teens and the lead devs all call me a hippie, 
not inaccurately.
> Is this a community project and if so, then meritocracy should not be part

The whole point of a meritocracy is that it allows the best like-minded 
talent to rise at the pace of ability rather than waiting for some 
pre-determined schedule (like the corporate world). That is the very 
definition of community. Not every community is a fit for every person. 
Where we can improve processes (and we all know there's a lot of room 
for improvement), we want to. But we're not going to just start 
haphazardly committing every patch that someone asks to have committed. 
That would ruin the application. The whole point of having leaders (in 
this case, lead developers) is for them to lead.

I'm adding to this thread a question and a comment..

first is the question, will we be able to do +1 on specific things
people have recommended?

I'd like to just add +1 to some of Mark Jaquith's list.. specifically no
more php4, better unit tests and some level of CI..

having better unit tests may make it easier for people to commit
patches.. that's not the goal here, but an unintended side effect.


comment:

the problem with meritocracies, is that sometimes "merit" isn't clearly
defined, so what/who "holds merit" is subjective, it's well intentioned,
but just don't get conveyed properly. In other words, meritocracies work
on ego, ego can and almost always insulted, sometimes deservingly,
sometimes not.




I'd like everyone here to read:
http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/34321/14-Ways-To-Be-A-Great-Startup-CEO.aspx

if they haven't already.

One of the things here, is about the uncanny ability to say "No".

Jane and the core developers have done a very good job of that, we may
not like it, but in the end, we have a product that we love 6 days of
the week. Let's not forget that, and let's not let our egos get in the
way. Some functionality may not make it into core, but usually it can be
made into a plugin, and you can have the functionality.. and that's what
we should be thankful for.

I've made a ton of money off the work of the core developers, I may not
like some of their responses, or the tone of their responses, I may not
respond the same way as they do.. but I am mindful of their
contributions, and their efforts.

As the year ends, I hope I can contribute in a positive way, either to
the core, or to the community,  I'm sure I'll piss people off, I'm sure
I'll write blog posts that some of you may disagree with, but the end
goal for all of us is the same.. make it easy for people to get their
content published, and make it easy for people to consume their content.

Happy 2011.

Thanks for the fish.

You can not say this is a community driven project and then completely
ignore the community aspect of the phrase. Is the project 5% community
driven, 10%, 20% or more? I also see contradictions and logical
inconsistencies in several of the statements and direction of the WordPress
development. I went over the WordPress Decision presentation by Jane Wells
at Portland and when you have a hierarchy where the contributors of patches
are so far down as to be irrelevant, then yes, you do have a corporate
process. One of the examples itself was one of a company and I quote, "You
can't walk into a Microsoft meeting and expect to be heard." Well, the quote
is not verbatim.

You are making this personal and I suspect you are not viewing this
appropriately. The problem has been and I suspect always will be the time to
get a patch in to core. I should also clarify that feedback is more
important than simply getting a patch in core. If you not only hear nothing,
but also not have your patch committed. This is not limited to me and if you
look at the history, there are plenty of potential contributors that never
were given the chance to be more than causal contributors. I have said in
the past and continue to say, that the turn around for patches needs to be
improved. As a user of WordPress, my desire is to see WordPress grow and
continue to be improved.

If the statement, "Well, join another community or project." Then the
statement should be clarified to mean, "Join a project that actually cares
about its contributors and gives feedback on patches in a timely manner."
This statement should NEVER be uttered by an official of the project and the
fact that you and others continue to defend and repeat the statement may
continue the downward trend of fewer contributors. If the desire is to have
mainly leads developing WordPress, then I believe you are moving in the
right path.

Okay, I am most likely wrong and I hope that I am. I seriously do. There are
areas where patches are consistency committed in a timely manner and patches
will probably continue to be made in those areas.

I am not wrong in that the current development process increases the
difficulty of getting patches in core. It is obvious that there is nothing I
can say at this point to convince you or any of the leads to change the
process, so I'm simply going to disappear until I have further proof for my
point.


Jacob Santos

PS: I did stop contributing around WordPress 2.8 and only contributed a few
patches since that time. Of course, this last development cycle, I
contributed around 7 patches, of which, 0 went into WordPress. I didn't even
get any feedback other then, "It is not my area."

Sorry, I couldn't change the subject when replying. Odd. I'm not sure why
you are trying to build a plugin to handle the new site. I'm sure we can
find an existing free system out there that we can incorporate into the new
site.

-Kinda confused on what you wish to accomplish.

Jacob,

Don't tell Jane to not take it personally when you go ahead and base an
entire thread on the state of your particular patches and then attempt to
frame our entire development process through that light. It's crap and it's
in complete disregard to what's really happening.

This thread is based on the fact that a half-dozen minor HTTP patches you
submitted never got reviewed by the component owner. I get that, but there
are also hundreds of other patches that required (and received) review, too.
Most of them are higher priority and address serious bugs or are dealing
with feature development. Yours did not.

You're never around, and you've already said you have no plans to continue
to participate. And yet, here we are. I'm not sure why.  If you want to keep
taking shots in the dark at what amount of this project is community-driven,
I'll provide you some real numbers. So allow me to share with the list some
stats on meritocracy and community:

WordPress 3.1 has had 1741 individual commits with 175 different
contributors. A shorter cycle accounts for the smaller numbers overall, but
the ratio is up from 3.0, which is fantastic. One third of those commits
were mine. Of those, I authored about half, and the other 280 commits were
patches by others that I reviewed.

There are a number of trusted contributors who provide strong code for
various components. Here's a list of the top contributors for 3.1. It can
double as an incomplete list of trusted
contributors: nacin, scribu, ryan, westi, PeteMall, filosofo, duck_,
dd32, ocean90, MarkJaquith, koopersmith.

Not coincidentally, these and other contributors are highly valued for the
project, and spend a great deal of time triaging and fixing bugs,
collaborating with each other, reviewing patches by others, participating in
dev chats and bug scrubs (these have happened almost daily all month), and
lead the direction of specific features and the project as a whole. They are
often involved on a daily basis. Anyone can become one of these
contributors. You just need to contribute.

I've earned the right to make decisions. I don't think you've earned the
right to sling mud.

Regards,
Nacin

Oh great.  Let's hope nobody named Mohammed gives a thumbs up to Jacob's position, or worse for anyone named Abraham to come along and side with Jesus against Mohammed otherwise I fear that all hell just might break loose in here.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Changes to sanitize_title
Message-ID: <AANLkTinPTNRnpVF99hJxjB6SoAqondTDbdsTiVuf9L7V@mail.gmail.com>

I've seen changes to sanitize_title function and filter [1] and I'm not sure
how this affects usage I'll describe.

Since in Serbian language we use Cyrillic script, we made optional
transliteration to Latin characters for URL slugs [2]. Our outdated and bad
code is based on older version of plugin Cyr-To-Lat [3]. There was a check
if there is a $_POST so that slugs are transliterated only on savings.

Now that there is context, should we safely remove this check for $_POST and
only apply transliteration when context is 'save'?

Thank in advance.

This is insulting. Since you joined the community after I left you might not
know that I am darkdragon, santosj and jacobsantos. You combine those
aliases in terms of props and of patches contributed and you will see that I
have more than my right to dissent. Hell, I even have the right to sling mud
and I do on occasion, however in this thread, I have not. Dissent != 'mud
slinging' and you have problems if you think they do equal.

Furthermore, it is even more insulting that you straw man my argument and
completely ignored my original points. My believe is that dissent is looked
down upon and often ignored. You reply to the substance of my argument and
then we will talk.

You don't see that I'm trying to help the project. If you don't want to
focus on lower priority tickets, then give someone commit rights and let
them focus on it for you. I could never understand why this wasn't the
answer to the problem in all of the time I've been in the community. Also, I
fail to understand why more bureaucracy was the answer.

Jacob Santos

PS: If you combine those three aliases, I am in the top 5 of the list of
patches contributed. I am in the list of top contributors as based on props.
I will remain on those two lists even if I take off 3 years. The fact
remains that majority of contributors never help again. Majority of
contributors help with their problem and then drop off never to be seen
again.

PSS: If you wish, I can post the statistics and you can see for youself.

I've earned the right to make decisions. I don't think you've earned the

Giving someone commit access to focus on lower priority tickets benefits no-one.

It just causes code churn, lack of project focus, and makes it more likely that important bugs will get ignored.

With all due respect, where's your proof for this? I suppose that a
good bit of this judgement would need to be made on a ticket-by-ticket
basis, but still...

If the tickets are legitimate yet somehow lower priority, how could
there possibly be no benefit?

The core team try and review every change that is made to the code to ensure that it is correct, doesn't introduce bugs etc.

There time should be focussed on the most important bugs.

Giving someone access to rush through all those easy trivial lower priority tickets with patches and commit them increases the workload for the core team and anyone else who reviews all the changesets.

Therefore less time is available for important bugs.

Cheers

Maybe I'm just bias, but the WordPress Core seems to be doing a great job at
what they're doing. The way things are being managed seems to be working
just fine. Why fix something that isn't broken?

Then perhaps the core team ought to either 1) expand or 2) not worry so much about each changeset and allow others to regression test.

Core team is always expanding... Just look at the all the new committers
this year. I don't think the core team will (or should) ever give up on
reviewing all changesets and rely on others for regression testing.

You should decide how you will include Aksimet in core. Latest version of
Akismet is 2.5.1 while WP 3.0.4 contains version 2.4 so those who regularly
update plugins reverted their versions and needed to update again.

So.. why not let Jacob become a core committer and be the person who 
handles the low hanging fruit? If his claims about being the # 5 
contributor are true,
he's definitely given his time, and if he's willing to put in the work.. 
why not let him?

I think what Doug is asking, is what proof do we have that having Jacob 
handle this is going to make WordPress suck?
If so many of his patches have been accepted, it's a safe bet he's got 
the hang of things..

Being an outsider to WordPress, but not open source projects.. I don't 
see how getting bugs resolved is a bad thing...especially if the bug 
made it through the triage process and was marked as low priority..

Having managed a project or two, I can say that it's often the little bugs that can throw a wrench in the whole operation. I can understand why the core team wouldn't want to give someone commit access only for the 'little' things ? that's kind of like handing someone a gun to swat flies. A better solution might be to have trusted users without access review patches and leave their comments on tickets. 

P.S. Trying to get things by whining rarely works past the age of 5.

I'm all for this, how do we establish these trusted users? or is the 
core team not interested in that at all?

Whining doesn't work, and calling someone a whiner doesn't work either, 
I think over all we'd all like to find a solution to this, instead of a 
"we'll acknowledge your patch whenever we feel like".. or "big dicking" 
each other, as was witnessed by Nacin and Jacob.. it makes everyone look 
childish.

This thread has obviously hit a nerve and ego, just find a solution and 
respect each other, and move on with it.

Having commit privileges doesn't make you better than anyone else on 
this list nor does the # of patches, or the number of hours you worked, 
no one should be taking the ability to commit to an open source project 
as a sign of their superiority, or inferiority.

None of the features in 3.1 cure cancer, save lives, or bring us world 
peace.. nor do they promise to do.. just relax.

3.1 is late, let's test it out, get it out the door, and then perhaps we 
can push the low hanging fruit into 3.1.x?

Vid,
I should clarify, I'm not on the core team (not even close), and I'd  
like to apologize for my remark about managing a few projects ? that  
sort of "big dicking" each other won't get us anywhere, you're right.  
Oftentimes it's used because the writer doesn't have anything useful  
to say or because he/she is lazy. I used it because I'm lazy (I hope),  
so let me explain.

With my (relatively minor) experience with projects, one of the best  
ways to control the quality of projects is to limit points of control.  
This isn't to say that any one person isn't worthy of commit access,  
but a dozen of the world's best minds together there are going to be  
communication (and, yes, ego) problems. Good projects have become  
bloated and quality has diminished because points of control weren't  
limited (see: FF).

Even the smallest bugs fixes and features can can lead to problems in  
the future if they aren't patched/built with foresight. Some might  
call having core developers commit bugs micromanagement or  
obsessiveness. I call it being thorough.

'Trusted users' might not earn an actual badge ? any user can help by  
applying a patch, testing it, reporting errors or coding problems.

I can't speak for the core team, but I would imagine reading the diff  
for a minor bug takes only a few minutes, so I don't see that part of  
the workflow to be a blocker. If it takes more time to read it's  
probably not the kind of patch that should be applied without thought.

Will

Will,
  I didn't think you were big dicking, or anything like that. The only 
two people guilty of that on this thread were Nacin and Jacob, I 
personally don't care who thinks they've earned the right to.. in my 
book no one has earned the right to be a dick, ever.

I understand Nacin and the rest of the core teams frustrations, 3.1 is 
behind, it's making them and us look bad, and committing bugs that are 
low priority, non show stoppers during an RC is plain silly.

Trusted users don't need a badge, trust is earned, I'm just curious why 
someone like Jacob is not on the trusted list, if he has indeed made as 
many contributions as he says he has.

The point Jacob is trying to make, is that if he's contributing, his 
work shouldn't be diminished to "we don't have time for your low 
priority crap".. which is the attitude that seems to have been emanating 
from his emails.

You can't ask the community for help, and then make fun of them for 
contributing to something you're not interested in, or were expecting 
help from.  If the ticket is open, and someone submits a patch, it 
shouldn't go ignored, either the ticket should be closed, or be put in 
the attic.

Again, I'm not saying anyone here is the only one at fault, 
unfortunately the pressure of a release, combined with delays, is 
putting everyone on edge.

I'm not saying we all need to sing kumbaya, just that we need to realize 
egos are getting in the way of productivity, and then move on with it.

All I'm proposing is that we address this issue AFTER 3.1 final is out, 
let the core team enjoy the holidays a bit, ring in the new year... and 
as I said in my first email to this thread, let's all thank the core 
team, and the contributors, even if their patches didn't make it into 
core yet.. their work is not going un noticed, even if it may look like 
it, during time crunches like this.

Man.. I sound like a hippy don't I? :)

We have trusted developers as well as some who are designated "bug 
gardeners" (Mark Jaquith was once a bug gardener before becoming a lead 
developer). If you go to http://wordpress.org/about/ and look in the 
sidebar, you'll get an idea of who the trusted developers are. We update 
that list every release or so, and with 3.1 I believe we'll be adding 
Jon Cave (duck_), Daryl Koopersmith, Dominik Schilling (ocean90), Pete 
Mall, (scribu), John O'Nolan, and Samuel Wood (otto42). Some of these 
people were granted commit access during 3.1, and some are likely future 
committers.

Partly because his main activity lately is taking focus away from 
development with things like this, partly because he has a tendency to 
appear and disappear without notice and we need to be able to rely on 
committers to be available and involved without whim, and partly because 
there are a lot of contributors who've been far more involved in 
positive, result-oriented discussion and coding over the past couple of 
releases that would be a better fit for commit access. It's not just 
about being a decent coder. If the committing devs don't share the 
vision of the lead devs, then you wind up with patches being committed 
at cross-purposes. It's not that dissent isn't allowed in the community, 
but the people committing things need to agree on what should be committed.

Jacob has contributed greatly to the project in the past, it's true. In 
addition to http and other funcitonal patches, he did a huge chunk with 
inline documentation in 2.7 that definitely lead to a lot of commit 
props (and verbal props from me in pretty much every talk or interview I 
did around that time). But that isn't a reason to add someone to the 
leadership group.

Thank you  for such a great response Jane, it's given me much more

as well.

On the projects when I used to work in the labs (afrl) this was always a 
huge concern, so what we did was assign them to the most experienced dev on 
the team that knew the ramifications of what would happen.   Boss man 
decided at one point to make a sub release just specifically for making all 
the code up to date with the functional code because at one point some of 
the tertiary code became too old to work with it properly and we had to keep 
making concessions in newer code.

Having managed a project or two, I can say that it's often the little bugs 
that can throw a wrench in the whole operation. I can understand why the 
core team wouldn't want to give someone commit access only for the 'little' 
things ? that's kind of like handing someone a gun to swat flies. A better 
solution might be to have trusted users without access review patches and 
leave their comments on tickets.

So.. why not let Jacob become a core committer and be the person who
handles the low hanging fruit? If his claims about being the # 5
contributor are true,
he's definitely given his time, and if he's willing to put in the work..
why not let him?

I think what Doug is asking, is what proof do we have that having Jacob
handle this is going to make WordPress suck?
If so many of his patches have been accepted, it's a safe bet he's got
the hang of things..

Being an outsider to WordPress, but not open source projects.. I don't
see how getting bugs resolved is a bad thing...especially if the bug
made it through the triage process and was marked as low priority..

but thank you for the bug catch and good suggestion.  There's a ticket 
logged for the issue is and its being addressed. As I understand it, 
3.0.x was tied to a specific version of Akismet - specifically in an 
attempt to decide how Akismet was being included in the core. It is 
having some unforeseen results. The core contributors will likely use a 
different method in the 3.1 release.

	Production Servers
Message-ID: <82660524-BEB9-40B4-9A6C-EF8F8F29C276@graymerica.com>

Does anyone think that a patch for an improved error handler in wp-includes/load.php would be well received or implemented into the core.

I would love a setting to only show Fatal / parse errors when developing.  Something that only show these errors and ignores all the deprecated, notices and other errors that come from plugins and from the core wordpress when I was developing.  Or at lease improve the options available for WP-config from DEBUG only.

Also, an error handler for production websites that is something other than a blank page.    Something with a little data or that could be customized with a theme.  I was thinking of using http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php  and a shutdown function (when possible) to improve the user experience.

Of course all of this would be optional, and not included in the code unless people turn it on.

Also if you enable define('E_DEPRECATED', false) ; I get a Fatal error: Unsupported operand types in ****/wp-includes/load.php on line 260

Does anyone think that if I worked up a patch for all this, it would be accepted.

thanks,

Andrew

Parse errors can't be suppressed during runtime. Why would you want to
suppress E_WARNING though? The only use case really for suppressing E_NOTICE
is if *other* plugins are spitting out a ton of notices. But if you're
developing on just core and your plugin, then you should really want to
prevent all E_NOTICE issues. (If you ever find one in core, *please* report
it.)

Thus, this really just comes down to WP_DEBUG versus not. If WP_DEBUG is on,
you get all notices. If it's off, you don't get any notices. What's the
third option you're looking for?

display_errors should never be enabled on a production site. You should log
these instead, via the php.ini error_log setting. If you really want to use
an error handler or shutdown function, you can do that yourself for sure.

You shouldn't define E_DEPRECATED. It's a core PHP constant. We're only
doing that to detect whether you're on PHP 5.3 or not. I just committed this
comment to trunk: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/17194, so I hope
that helps.

Improvements here would certainly be considered. Could you read through my
feedback and re-propose what you'd like to see?

Thanks!
